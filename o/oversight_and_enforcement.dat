25|$|The {{legislature}} has redefined congressional districts {{over the years}} to reflect population changes in the state. Districts 5 through 8 were reallocated to the 1st, 3rd and 4th. The 2nd, bounded by the Mississippi River on the west, continues to have a black-majority population. Since the 20th-century realignment of political parties in the South following passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965, which provided federal <b>oversight</b> <b>and</b> <b>enforcement</b> to protect voting, African-American residents here have consistently supported Democratic party candidates.

25|$|The state {{population}} in 1900 was 47% African-American: {{a total of}} 652,013 citizens. Many in New Orleans were descendants of Creoles of color, the sizeable population of free people of color before the Civil War. By 1900, {{two years after the}} new constitution, only 5,320 black voters were registered in the state. Because of disfranchisement, by 1910 there were only 730 black voters (less than 0.5 percent of eligible African-American men), despite advances in education and literacy among blacks and people of color. Blacks were excluded from the political system and also unable to serve on juries. White Democrats had established one-party Democratic rule, which they maintained in the state for decades deep into the 20th century until after Congressional passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act provided federal <b>oversight</b> <b>and</b> <b>enforcement</b> of the constitutional right to vote.|$|E
5000|$|Since 2000 {{there has}} been major growth {{in the area of}} Clarksburg.

Several public parks [...] and schools have been developed to help accommodate the growth. During the boom growth period it was discovered that some of the new houses were built closer together than the minimum distance required by zoning laws, with roads built too narrow for firetrucks to pass, and homes and community facilities built without adequate permits or approvals by local authorities. This was found to be the fault of inadequate county <b>oversight</b> <b>and</b> lax <b>enforcement</b> of building codes and laws combined with a building boom in the early 2000s.|$|R
40|$|The {{municipal}} securities {{market has}} recently become {{the target of}} increased regulatory scrutiny. Once considered a “sleepy market,” the market is now burdened by new regulations, increased <b>oversight,</b> <b>and</b> heightened <b>enforcement,</b> which place direct disclosure obligations on municipal securities issuers. As such, the clear provisions of the 1975 Tower Amendment, which limit regulation of the municipal securities market to anti-fraud actions, have been cut off at all corners. This Article examines the fundamental discord between regulating the municipal securities market with the same structure and intensity as the corporate securities market. This Article proposes limiting the reach of federal regulatory bodies on the municipal securities market because of the harmful and unnecessary impacts had by overbroad regulatory actions. To subdue these harms, this Article ultimately suggests that registration and disclosure requirements place undue burdens on municipal issuers and their counterparts, and that regulatory bodies {{should be limited to}} controlling municipal securities through anti-fraud actions...|$|R

40|$|Every day in Alabama, {{thousands}} of people report to work at vast poultry processing plants. Inside these frigid plants, workers stand almost shoulder-to-shoulder as chicken carcasses zip by on high-speed processing lines. Together, small teams of workers may hang, gut or slice more than 100 birds in a single minute. It's a process they'll repeat for eight hours or more in order to prepare birds for dinner tables and restaurants across America. This grueling work serves {{as the foundation of}} a lucrative industry that supplies the country's most popular meat. It's an industry with an $ 8. 5 billion impact on the state [...] generating about 75, 000 jobs and 10 percent of Alabama's economy [...] and one that plays a vital economic role in numerous small towns. But it all comes at a steep price for the low-paid, hourly workers who face the relentless pressure of the mechanized processing line. This is the face of the modern poultry industry in Alabama [...] an industry unfettered by serious regulation and blessed with a vulnerable workforce that has lacked a voice in the halls of government and has little power to effect change.

40|$|Excerpt] The nation’s {{job safety}} laws were enacted 40 years ago. The Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) {{has never been}} updated. Penalties are weak even in cases where workers are killed, the government’s {{enforcement}} tools are limited and protections for workers who raise job safety concerns are woefully inadequate. Legislation has been introduced in the Congress to prevent future disasters and protect the safety and health of miners and other workers. H. R. 5663 strengthens the Mine Safety and Health Act and Occupational Safety and Health Act, the nation’s primary job safety laws. The bill – the “Miner Safety and Health Act of 2010 ” - provides for stepped up <b>enforcement</b> <b>and</b> tougher penalties for employers who flagrantly violate the law and enhances the protection of miners and workers who speak out about job hazards, report injuries and exercise their rights. The mine safety provisions address problems identified after the Upper Big Branch disaster, including increased <b>oversight,</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>and</b> penalties for mines with a pattern of violations. The provisions to strengthen the OSH Act come from H. R. 2067 – the Protecting America’s Workers Act – legislation introduced last year {{and the subject of}} numerous Congressional hearings...|$|R
