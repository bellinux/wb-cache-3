The analysis highlights the expectation effects of offsets on the bargaining price and the scale of delivery.

Recent debates on the Kyoto Protocol {{have emphasized the}} potential threat of transaction costs {{to the implementation of}} emissions trading for the Protocol and consequently to the successful implementation of the Protocol. One way to suppress transaction costs is to use experience. In line with the EU Green Paper, we propose that an experimental early action before the Kyoto period could be helpful to reduce the transaction costs in emissions trading for the Kyoto compliance. However, because early action will incur additional costs, the final gain due to early action will be the cost-saving net of the costs of early action. This paper explores the relationship between the transaction costs in emissions trading and the early action effort to reduce transaction costs in the case of Kyoto Protocol. We find that in general early action can effectively <b>offset</b> <b>transaction</b> costs and thus are economically efficient.

The political contracting approach to institutional supply suggests that watershed partnerships are more likely to emerge when potential benefits outweigh the transaction costs of developing and maintaining new institutions.

Allowing such flexibility {{in response to the}} terms of recently announced total maximum daily load (TMDL) restrictions might considerably decrease costs of compliance with the TMDLs. Before an effective and efficient market for offsets can be established, however, certain preconditions must be met. In particular, there must be means by which nutrients can be measured, allowances can be assigned, and limits on nutrient discharges enforced. In this paper we consider some factors that may affect the realization of these preconditions. A recurrent theme is that there are tradeoffs in policy design. A regime that imposes tight restrictions on those who are eligible to trade may also limit the cost savings that might be realized from trading. On the other hand, a regime that maximizes market participation might fail fully to achieve the environmental goals of an offset or trading policy. We conclude with some recommendations for steps that might be taken to initiate limited markets in nutrient and sediment discharges. These markets might then be expanded as experience is gained and methods developed to assure improved market performance. water quality trading, <b>offsets,</b> <b>transaction</b> costs, adverse selection, leakage, additionality, monitoring, Chesapeake Bay, nutrients...|$|R
5000|$|Central {{counterparty}} clearing, {{also referred}} to as central counterparty (CCP), is a financial institution that provides clearing and settlement services for trades in foreign exchange, securities, options and derivative contracts. A clearing house stands between two clearing firms (also known as member firms or participants). Its purpose is to reduce the risk a member firm failing to honor its trade settlement obligations. A CCP reduces the settlement risks by netting <b>offsetting</b> <b>transactions</b> between multiple counterparties, by requiring collateral deposits (also called [...] "margin deposits"), by providing independent valuation of trades and collateral, by monitoring the credit worthiness of the member firms, and in many cases, by providing a guarantee fund {{that can be used to}} cover losses that exceed a defaulting member's collateral on deposit. The advantages of a central counterparty clearing arrangement are greater transparency of the risks, reduced processing costs, and greater certainty in cases of default by a member.Once a trade has been executed by two counterparties, it is submitted to a clearing house, which then steps between the two original traders' clearing firms and assumes the legal counterparty risk for the trade. For example, a trade between member firm A and firm B becomes two trades: A-CCP and CCP-B. This process is called novation.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyzes offset {{arrangements in}} government procurement. Offsets are nonstandard contracts that oblige a foreign seller to provide extra {{benefits to the}} purchasing government 2 ̆ 7 s economy {{as a condition for}} the sale of goods and services. In many instances, governments prefer to realize these benefits in the form of in-kind-transfer instead of bargaining for discounts of the sale price. I employ the theoretical tools of the new institutional economics to explain why governments are electing to leave the price margin for some types of purchases, and to determine under what economic settings offsets are an efficient policy instrument. The new institutional economics approach is well suited for this study because it highlights three factors—transaction costs, asymmetric information, and bounded rationality—that figure prominently in government procurement of high technology goods and services. ^ In chapter 2, I define offset and examine the contractual attributes of the arrangement. Using these definitions, I then provide an historical account of offset arrangements since the 1930 s. This chapter describes how governments have modified the structure of offsets continually to accommodate different objectives. ^ Chapters 3 and 4 develop the core theory and policy implications of the dissertation. Chapter 3 introduces a model that demonstrates how offset arrangements may support exchange by reducing transaction costs. In chapter 4, I present a policy matrix that offers general guidelines for procurement officers considering offsets. This study will probably be of practical value to the 130 governments currently experimenting with offsets. An important finding is that mandatory offset programs are advised only for a subset of government purchases. ^ In chapter 5, I introduce an empirical model to test recent theoretical claims in the literature. Using a rich data set of three years of <b>offset</b> <b>transactions,</b> I estimate an econometric model that supports the view that offsets are the outcome of transaction cost economizing and political economy variables.

40|$|The Japanese {{economy is}} {{currently}} experiencing a major merger and acquisition (M&A) boom unprecedented in its postwar economic development. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to cast light, from a number of angles, on the determinants of the rapid increase in M&A activity in Japan since the end of the 1990 s, and its economic role. First, the paper examines the international characteristics of M&As in Japan with regard to the reasons why they have occurred and the characteristic form they have adopted. It emphasizes the fact that while the M&A boom that has occurred in recent years has factors in common with the global boom, for example growth opportunities created by technological innovation and deregulation, it is also based on factors unique to Japan, such as the economic shock, which have led to over-investment and the development of the legal system for business combinations. In addition, among the characteristics of M&As in Japan it indicates the strong tendency for amalgamations, acquisitions, capital participations, etc., by holding companies in order to maintain the independence of the target companies, and shows that principally these take the form of <b>offsetting</b> <b>transactions</b> between the parties concerned. This characteristic differs sharply from the form adopted in the U. S. and British M&A markets, which are characterized by a strong tendency to opt for mergers (integration of corporations) by means of arm's-length transactions. Also stressed is that, with regard to the relationship between the evolution of the Japanese corporate system and M&As, the dismantlement of the traditional Japanese corporate system has hastened the M&A boom, and because the system has evolved into a hybrid form, this feature itself has given M&A activity in Japan its own unique character. Second, the paper summarizes the economic role fulfilled by increasing M&As from the perspective of focusing on their duality. Its basic message is that since the end of the 1990 s M&As have helped to enhance the efficiency of resource allocation in the Japanese economy and of companies' organizational efficiency; that the activities of activist funds have had a positive impact on share values and have influenced the financial policies of the target companies; and that we have not yet seen the systematic occurrence of negative aspects of M&As, such as management overconfidence, the overvaluation of stock markets, and the breakdown of trust between stakeholders as a result of M&As. ...|$|R

Energy service contracts allow the client to reduce operating costs, transfer risk and concentrate attention on core activities.

A challenge for both business strategy and public policy is to identify those situations in which energy service contracting {{is most likely to}} be appropriate and the conditions under which it is most likely to succeed.

40|$|Abstract — This article {{presents}} some results about schedulability analysis of tasks with offsets {{also known as}} transactions, in the particular case of monotonic transactions. The impact of a transaction on the response time of a lower priority task under analysis is computed with the interference implied by the transaction. In the general context of tasks with <b>offsets</b> (general <b>transactions),</b> only exponential methods are known to calculate the exact worst-case response time of a task. However, in this case, Mäki-Turja and Nolin have proposed an efficient approximation method. A monotonic pattern in a transaction (regarding the priority of the task under analysis), occurs when, by rotation of the higher priority tasks in a transaction, {{it is possible to}} find a pattern of tasks such that the processor demand of the transaction is monotically decreasing during a period of the transaction. We have shown in our previous work that if a task under analysis is such that all the interfering transactions are monotonic, then it is possible to evaluate its exact response time in a pseudo-polynomial time. This {{article presents}} in detail how to apply this method. Then, it compares our results to the multiframe model proposed by Mok and Chen in [5] (AM "Accumulatively Monotonic " pattern). We show that the multiframe model is a particular instance of tasks with offsets but the results presented for AM multiframe cannot be applied on monotonic transactions. Finally, we show that the approximation method proposed by Mäki-Turja and Nolin computes an exact response time in the case of monotonic transactions, even if its complexity is higher than the one of the test that we proposed.

Furthermore, the effect of land trade and related transaction costs on the socially optimal number of reserve sites is analyzed. The analysis suggests that in the presence of diminishing returns to farming area, the socially optimal number of reserve sites (which maximizes social welfare) is generally larger than the ecologically optimal number (which maximizes an ecological objective such as population viability). When the opportunity costs of conservation can be <b>offset</b> by land <b>transactions,</b> however, the socially optimal number of reserve sites might be closer to the ecological optimum.

40|$|Paul Daugerdas gained notoriety {{for himself}} and his {{erstwhile}} firm, Jenkens 2 ̆ 6 Gilchrist, as the designer of a tax shelter that uses contingent liabilities to generate artificial tax losses on a grand scale. The basic shelter transaction is surprisingly simple. In essence, it uses offsetting options to inflate the basis of property that is distributed by a partnership and then contributed to and sold by another partnership, resulting in a large tax loss without any corresponding economic loss. In principle, this type of shelter could be replicated indefinitely and generate unlimited tax losses. Mr. Daugerdas is by no means unique. The transactions that he approved as shelter counsel on behalf of Jenkens 2 ̆ 6 Gilchrist differ only in trivial details from myriad other transactions peddled by other lawyers and accountants. Contingent-liability tax shelters are a highly risky business. Mr. Daugerdas and others like him reaped enormous rewards for themselves and their clients, but some of the tax shelters they designed for credulous and wealthy clients have backfired spectacularly. Congress and the Treasury have taken remedial action to shut down abusive tax shelters, and several courts have invoked the longstanding judicial doctrines to strike down transactions that lack economic substance and have no real business or investment purpose, despite purported compliance with the literal terms of the tax laws. The proliferation of abusive tax shelters could never have gotten off the ground without the active participation of high-priced counsel. Upon discovering that the anticipated tax benefits failed to materialize, disgruntled clients have rushed to sue the lawyers, accountants, investment advisers, and banks that created and marketed defective shelters. This article discusses several challenges faced by Congress, the Treasury, and the courts in dealing with contingent-liability tax shelters. The article examines the role of Daugerdas and his firm in creating and marketing contingent-liability shelters, against the broader background of the tax shelter industry.

40|$|Hedging {{can be a}} {{valuable}} tool to minimize price uncertainty for producers. There {{are two types of}} hedges producers may use, a short hedge and a long hedge. Short hedges are used to lock in a net selling price when prices are expected to fall, while a long hedge is used to lock in a buying price when prices are expected to rise for a commodity that is bought and used as an input. A short hedge is initiated by selling a contract on the futures market. The contract is generally bought back close to the time the contracted commodity is sold in the cash market. If the futures contract value decreases, money is made on the transaction. If the futures contract increases in value as time passes, money is lost on the transaction. The resulting gain/loss on the futures contract <b>transactions</b> <b>offset</b> changes in the cash market due to price changes for the commodity, resulting in the net amount paid or received being close to the expected price. The reason this works in deferring risk is that movements in the cash price generally reflect the futures price, with the difference defined as the basis. If basis behaves in a normal way, the actual payoff or net price received will be the same as the expected price. A long hedge is the reciprocal of the short hedge. A long hedge is initiated to protect the producer from the expectation of rising costs...|$|R
40|$|Is hedging {{with credit}} {{derivatives}} always beneficial? The benefit of hedging with credit derivatives, such as credit default swaps, is presumed by the Dodd-Frank Act, which excludes hedge transactions from {{much of the}} new financial regulation. Yet, new, significant risks can arise when credit derivatives are used to manage risks. Hedging, therefore, should be defined not only in relation to whether a <b>transaction</b> <b>offsets</b> risks, but also whether, on balance, the risks that are mitigated, as well as any new risks that arise, are outweighed by the potential benefits. Firms using credit derivatives to hedge often fail to account for the full costs associated with using those instruments. There are numerous risks that can arise. Informational asymmetries and negative externalities, however, make it difficult for firms to accurately assess those risks. Consequently, the far-reaching exemptions for hedge activity provided by the Dodd-Frank Act are inappropriate. Credit derivative hedges must be subject to regulatory oversight, rather than exemption. Regulation of the derivatives markets must consider the risks of hedging with credit derivatives and the inability of firms to account for those risks, as well as the value to firms of mitigating risks with credit derivatives and the costs arising from their use. Among other proscriptions, the types of credit derivatives transactions that can be classified as a hedge should be limited, as well as the size of those positions. In addition, margin and collateral requirements for credit derivatives should take account of the greater risks arising from their use...|$|R
40|$|It is a {{well-established}} {{fact that the}} foreign exchange market is the largest financial {{market in the world}} 1. However, it is relatively less well-known that currency options and other foreign exchange-related derivatives have become more popular and prominent in size since the mid- 1980 ’s. Today, currency options are used by numerous players in the financial market, including portfolio managers, hedgers, speculators and even central bankers. Despite their popularity amongst market participants, research in currency options has received little attention in comparison with options on stocks and other underlying assets. This is not surprising as most of the currency option contracts are written by commercial and investment banks in the privately negotiated over-thecounter option markets rather than the exchange-traded markets. This thesis provides empirical investigations into the behaviour of implied volatility quotes for currency options on the British pound/U. S. dollar (GBP/USD), the euro/U. S. dollar (EUR/USD), the Australian dollar/U. S. dollar (AUD/USD) and the U. S. dollar/Japanese yen (USD/JPY). The analyses are performed using dealer-quoted implied volatility and spot exchange rate datasets collected from the over-the-counter currency option market. 1 According to the Triennial Central Bank Survey conducted by the Bank for International Settlements, global foreign exchange market recorded a daily turnover of USD 3. 21 trillion in April 2007 (See Table B. 1 of the survey released in December 2007). viii Two main aspects of the implied volatility quotes are examined in this dissertation. First, the time series behaviour of implied volatility of various maturities is analysed. Second, analysis concerning the dynamics of implied volatility smiles for these four currency-pairs is undertaken. The first empirical chapter examines the random walk hypothesis using implied volatility quotes of various maturities. Conventional and nonparametric variance ratio tests are performed on the volatility levels and first-differences. The results provide evidence of random walk violations in the volatility series across all currency pairs examined. Specifically, strong rejections are found in the short-dated volatility of one week and one month. Further, out-of-sample robustness tests suggest that forecasting implied volatility changes using a random walk model produce significantly higher forecasting errors compared with two alternative models based on the artificial neural networks (ANNs) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) frameworks. These findings suggest that short-dated implied volatility are better characterised as a mean-reverting process while the random walk process captures long-dated implied volatility more accurately. The analysis in the second chapter extends the key findings by examining the profitability of volatility trading using a simple technical trading strategy. This study concludes that the trading rules generated positive returns in the majority of the currency pairs even after allowing for volatility and exchange rate spreads. The buy straddle signals generate positive average holding-period returns for three of the four currency pairs examined. Further, the average holding-period return of the buy trade is statistically different from the average holding-period return of the sell trade. This is ix especially evident for the USD/JPY straddles. Conversely, risk reversal trades produced less compelling outcomes with lower winning trades and holding-period returns. Thus the overall results suggest that moving average trading rules are useful in volatility trading. In addition the profits from the option strategies are often large enough to <b>offset</b> the <b>transaction</b> costs. The third analysis chapter examines a well-known empirical anomaly in the currency option market. Specifically, the relation between the dynamics of the volatility smile and the anticipated volatility for the GBP/USD, EUR/USD, AUD/USD and USD/JPY currency pairs is investigated. The analysis uses a unique trader-quoted implied volatility dataset to construct the volatility smile over the sample period. To fully capture the time series dynamics of the volatility smile, different measures of volatility smile dynamics are employed, namely, (i) the slope coefficient of the call and put volatility curves, (ii) a measure of curvature, and (iii) the degree of skewness in the daily volatility smile. The Granger-causality tests show that the lagged coefficients for the recursive GARCH estimates are statistically different from zero over the optimal lag choice. This evidence of a unidirectional relationship is particularly strong when the tests are performed using put volatility curves. The results also reveal significant feedback between the curvature of the volatility smile and the quoted volatility. Further, tests are performed using a trivariate vector autoregressive model and impulse response functions to trace the impact of a volatility shock. A robustness test using probit regression suggests evidence of predictability of jumps using the smile curvature and out-of-money options. Consistent with recent literature, this study suggests that the behaviour of the volatility smile is driven by trading activities induced by the anticipated risk in the foreign exchange market. x The final analysis chapter extends earlier empirical work on volatility forecasting using information subsumed in the volatility smile dynamics. Specifically, it combines volatility smile dynamics with corresponding at-the-money implied volatility and GARCH(1, 1) volatility estimates to forecast realised exchange rate volatility. The relative information content of the forecasting models is analysed using encompassing regression tests. The coefficients for smile curvature are both significant and negatively related to the level of implied volatility. The validity of the unbiasedness and efficiency hypothesis for the implied volatility forecasts is found {{to be related to the}} shape of the volatility smile. In particular, when the smile effect is more pronounced, the forecast performance of the implied volatility series deteriorates. ...|$|R
