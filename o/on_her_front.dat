25|$|Different cover artwork {{was created}} by Soejima for the 360 and PS3 versionsthe PS3 cover showed Catherine showing off her cleavage, while the 360 cover had Katherine lying <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>front</b> showing her behind. Soejima was {{originally}} told by Hashino to create covers that would catch people's eyes in stores; the different cover arts for different versions was chosen as they felt it would be interesting. The two characters were originally {{going to be in}} identical, near-naked poses. This was changed due to the character's different charms, which it was felt would be lost if they were posed in such a way. Soejima went through multiple cover designs, with one being the two characters holding different cutlery utensils. Hashino had little involvement beyond his initial instruction, but did ask that more of Katherine's back be shown in the image. The covers exemplified each character's contrasting appeal: Catherine's cleavage showed off her youthful beauty, while displaying Katherine's behind was meant to evoke her more motherly charms. This artwork was used for retail posters, but Atlus also created alternate artwork for stores that wanted something less risque.|$|E

500|$|Cartman starts selling {{copies of}} his book, What Happened to My School?, outside the {{cafeteria}} where Stan confronts him. Angry because of Cartman's outrageous sexual lies about Wendy in his book, Stan tries to convince Cartman to stop selling the books to no avail. Principal Victoria and Mr. Mackey again confront Cartman, and force him to stop selling his books on school grounds. This upsets Cartman, who accuses them of turning the school into a [...] "socialist horrorland", and insists he is leaving the school. The next day, however, he appears on his show and spins a portrayal of himself in blue face-paint and suspenders, having somehow found Smurfland, becoming part of Smurf culture and eventually {{falling in love with}} Smurfette. Cartman then claims that Wendy bulldozed Smurfland and slaughtered the Smurfs to get their valuable Smurfberries, the complete story of which he has chronicled in his DVD, [...] "Dances with Smurfs". Despite {{the fact that it is}} extremely obvious that the footage of [...] "Wendy" [...] was Cartman in disguise, Butters and a furious mob of students go to Wendy's house to confront her. Butters pees <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>front</b> door and demands that she go on Cartman's morning announcements show to answer his questions.|$|E
500|$|The episode makes several {{references}} to {{popular culture and}} history. One of the opening scenes sees Principal Skinner knocking out {{a man in a}} very similar manner to Mick Dundee in Crocodile Dundee. The episode includes a scene based on Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now, where Lisa and Bob Hope escape the Fort Springfield stage. It also makes two {{references to}} Star Wars, where the caricature artist displays a caricature of Darth Vader and a montage shows Lisa with a double-bun hairdo like Princess Leia. The Springfield Waxworks' Chamber of Horrors contains Mr. T, Ronald Reagan and Dr. Ruth, and Laramie's mascot Menthol Moose is a parody of Joe Camel. Musically, Homer mournfully sings a song, [...] "Blimpy Boy", to the tune of The Seekers' [...] "Georgy Girl". Historically, there is a parody of the Hindenburg disaster, when the Duff Blimp crashes into the radio tower, to which Kent Brockman quotes [...] "Oh, the humanity!" [...] When Lisa is sworn in as Little Miss Springfield <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>front</b> lawn, Marge is to her left wearing a pink suit-dress in a pose similar to that of Jacqueline Kennedy in the famous photo of Lyndon B.

500|$|Mary Alice {{appears in}} flashbacks and dream {{sequences}} in {{the remainder of}} the series, during which several previously unknown details about the day she committed suicide are revealed. In season two, Mary Alice {{was the first of the}} housewives to move onto Wisteria Lane, to which she recounts how she met each of them and how they all became friends. In season three, Lynette has a recurring nightmare of the last time she spoke to Mary Alice; while she was reading her blackmail note for the first time <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>front</b> lawn, the day she committed suicide. Lynette asks if she is okay, to which Mary Alice says she is and while Lynette knew otherwise, she had groceries that needed refrigeration, so she simply told Mary Alice she would see her later. After a hostage situation at the local grocery store, Lynette has one final dream in which she speaks to Mary Alice and asks how she can help her; she tells her that we can’t prevent what we can’t predict, and to enjoy the beautiful day, as we get so few of them. Afterward, Mary Alice states that this was the last time Lynette would ever dream of her, and for her sake, she is grateful. In season four, Mary Alice appears in two separate flashbacks to when Katherine Mayfair (Dana Delany) was first living on Wisteria Lane; in [...] "Now You Know", she and Susan knock on Katherine’s door wondering why there is a moving truck outside her house, to which a rattled Katherine says she got a new job in Chicago. In [...] "Free", Mary Alice is shown to have been babysitting Katherine's daughter Dylan (Hailee Denham) the night the child's father returned, to which Katherine looks immediately panicked and Mary Alice apologizes for any wrongdoing.|$|E

Poppy is subsequently evicted from her bedsit, but Fatboy (Ricky Norwood) offers her a place to stay, and Tanya offers Poppy a permanent job at the salon. Poppy then moves into Dot Cotton's (June Brown) house after being offered a room by Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell). Poppy forgives Anthony, and begins a new friendship with Alice Branning (Jasmyn Banks). She starts a relationship with Fatboy, after her sister Tansy Meadow's (Daisy Wood-Davis) visit, where Fatboy acts as Poppy's [...] "high-flying" [...] businessman boyfriend in front of Tansy, {{in an effort to make}} herself look good in front of her younger [...] "successful" [...] sister. Although it is revealed that Tansy is not that successful, she tells Poppy that Fatboy loves her. The two start a relationship and later declare their love for each other. After a few months, Poppy sees text messages on Fatboy's phone from a girl called Chloe (Siobhan Athwal), and suspects he is cheating on her, and is further upset when she sees them together.

2500|$|In 1962, Gleason resurrected his {{variety show}} with more splashiness {{and a new}} hook: a fictitious general-interest {{magazine}} called The American Scene Magazine, through which Gleason trotted out his old characters in new scenarios; including two new Honeymooners sketches. He also added another catchphrase to the American vernacular, first uttered in the 1963 film Papa's Delicate Condition: [...] "How sweet it is!" [...] The Jackie Gleason Show: The American Scene Magazine was a hit, and continued for four seasons. Each show began with Gleason delivering a monologue and commenting on the attention-getting outfits of band leader Sammy Spear. Then the [...] "magazine" [...] features would be trotted out, from Hollywood gossip (reported by comedian Barbara Heller) to news flashes (played for laughs with a stock company of second bananas, chorus girls and dwarfs). Comedian Alice Ghostley occasionally appeared as a downtrodden tenement resident, sitting <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>front</b> step and listening to boorish boyfriend Gleason for several minutes. After the boyfriend took his leave, the smitten Ghostley would exclaim, [...] "I'm the luckiest girl in the world!" [...] Veteran comics Johnny Morgan, Sid Fields, and Hank Ladd were occasionally seen opposite Gleason in comedy sketches. Helen Curtis played alongside him as a singer and actress, delighting audiences with her 'Madame Plumpadore' sketches with 'Reginald Van Gleason.' ...|$|E

2500|$|Watermark {{opens with}} a same-titled {{instrumental}} track with wordless vocals, a tradition that Enya continued on her next three studio albums. Its title derived from a poem Roma was writing {{at the time of}} recording, which inspired her to name the track accordingly. However, the track was kept as an instrumental and the poem was left unused. It was printed {{for the first time in}} the liner notes for Enya's 2002 box set, Only Time – The Collection. During a meeting with Enya, Diana, Princess of Wales revealed that [...] "Watermark" [...] was a favourite of hers. [...] "Cursum Perficio" [...] came about after Enya and the Ryans had seen a documentary on American actress and model Marilyn Monroe, who once wrote the phrase on the tiles <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>front</b> doorstep. It means [...] "Your journey ends here" [...] in Latin, and Roma completed a set of Latin lyrics based around the phrase. Enya wanted her vocals to be [...] "bold and up-front" [...] like that of a choral piece, and realised early on that translating its lyrics into English or Gaelic would not complement the music, so Latin was used. [...] "On Your Shore" [...] refers to Magheragallon Beach at Enya's hometown of Gweedore, County Donegal that houses a cemetery where her grandparents are buried. Its emotional and personal connection to her childhood inspired her to write it. She explained, [...] "When the first people lived in Gweedore, there was a sort of shelter for the fishermen ... The sea came in when there was a sermon going on and everybody was wiped out. There are a lot of stories like that, where we would start to talk about them and a song would evolve." [...] It was written as an instrumental at first, but Enya and Nicky found lyrics suited the track better. Numerous [...] "vocal experiments" [...] were tried out for it, but neither suited the music, so it took the more simple form of a single lead vocal with one synthesiser. The clarinet solo was originally sung on its demo, but Nicky suggested a clarinet was the most suitable instrument which suited the vocals she used when singing it.|$|E

60|$|The fire {{illuminating}} this room, reader, is such as, if {{you be a}} southern, you do {{not often}} see burning on the hearth of a private apartment.

He sits beside it with a book in his hand, a little round stand at his elbow supporting a candle; {{but he is not}} reading--he is watching his children. Opposite to him sits his lady--a personage whom I might describe minutely, but I feel no vocation to the task. I see her, though, very plainly before me--a large woman of the gravest aspect, care <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>front</b> and on her shoulders, but not overwhelming, inevitable care, rather the sort of voluntary, exemplary cloud and burden people ever carry who deem it their duty to be gloomy. Ah, well-a-day! Mrs. Yorke had that notion, and grave as Saturn she was, morning, noon, and, night; and hard things she thought if any unhappy wight--especially of the female sex--who dared in her presence to show the light of a gay heart on a sunny countenance. In her estimation, to be mirthful was to be profane, to be cheerful was to be frivolous. She drew no distinctions. Yet she was a very good wife, a very careful mother, looked after her children unceasingly, was sincerely attached to her husband; only the worst of it was, if she could have had her will, she would not have permitted him to have any friend in the world beside herself. All his relations were insupportable to her, and she kept them at arm's length.|$|E
