5|$|The left {{edge of the}} {{conveyor}} belt is sharp due to higher density air moving in from the west forcing a sharp slope to the cold front. An area of stratiform precipitation develops poleward <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> front along {{the conveyor}} belt. Active precipitation poleward <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> front implies potential for greater development of the cyclone. A portion of this conveyor belt turns to the right (left in the Southern Hemisphere), aligning with the upper level westerly flow. However, the western portion of this belt wraps around the northwest (southwest in the Southern Hemisphere) side of the cyclone, which can contain moderate to heavy precipitation. If the air mass is cold enough, the precipitation falls {{in the form of}} heavy snow. Theory from the 1980s talked about the presence of a cold conveyor belt originating north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> front and flowing along a clockwise path (in the northern hemisphere) into the main belt of the westerlies aloft, but there has been conflicting evidence {{as to whether or not}} this phenomenon actually exists.|$|E
5|$|An {{occluded}} front is formed {{during the process}} of cyclogenesis when a cold front overtakes a warm front. The cold and warm fronts curve naturally poleward into the point of occlusion, which is also known as the triple point in meteorology. It lies within a sharp trough, but the air mass behind the boundary can be either warm or cold. In a cold occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is cooler than the cool air ahead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> front, and plows under both air masses. In a warm occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is not as cool as the cold air ahead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> front, and rides over the colder air mass while lifting the warm air. A wide variety of weather can be found along an {{occluded front}}, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Occluded fronts are indicated on a weather map by a purple line with alternating half-circles and triangles pointing in direction of travel. Occluded fronts usually form around mature low pressure areas.|$|E
5|$|By early afternoon, the {{low-pressure}} {{area had}} moved east into Nebraska, while the warm front had moved northward into southern Minnesota. The atmosphere {{to the south}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> front was strongly capped, meaning that {{the best chance of}} thunderstorm development was in areas along and slightly north of the front. By the time the thunderstorms started developing, CAPE values were 2000J/kg, indicating moderate atmospheric instability. Also present were low-level and deep-layer wind shear values of , respectively. All of these factors combined to create very favorable conditions for the development of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} March 31, 1986 and concluded on June 20, 1986, {{on a budget}} of $18 million. Filming began in Eldridge Street, Manhattan, New York City, which acted as Harry Angel's neighbourhood. Production designer Brian Morris and the set decorating team spent two months designing the set prior to filming, hoping to recreate 1950s New York. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> weather conditions, ice trucks were used to create fake snow. Filming then moved to Alphabet City in Manhattan, where several bar scenes and Angel's intimate bedroom scene with Connie (Whitcraft) were filmed.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} cyclone can cease to have tropical characteristics {{in several different}} ways. One such way is if it moves over land, thus depriving it <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> water it needs to power itself, quickly losing strength. Most strong storms lose their strength very rapidly after landfall and become disorganized areas of low pressure {{within a day or}} two, or evolve into extra{{tropical cyclone}}s. There is a chance a tropical cyclone could regenerate if it managed to get back over open warm water, such as with Hurricane Ivan. If it remains over mountains for even a short time, weakening will accelerate. Many storm fatalities occur in mountainous terrain, when diminishing cyclones unleash their moisture as torrential rainfall. This rainfall may lead to deadly floods and mudslides, {{as was the case with}} Hurricane Mitch around Honduras in October 1998. Without warm surface water, the storm cannot survive.|$|E
5|$|The wet, or rainy, {{season is}} the time of year, {{covering}} one or more months, when most of the average annual rainfall in a region falls. The term green season is also sometimes used as a euphemism by tourist authorities. Areas with wet seasons are dispersed across portions of the tropics and subtropics. Savanna climates and areas with monsoon regimes have wet summers and dry winters. Tropical rainforests technically do not have dry or wet seasons, since their rainfall is equally distributed through the year. Some areas with pronounced rainy seasons will see a break in rainfall mid-season when the intertropical convergence zone or monsoon trough move poleward of their location during the middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> season. When the wet season occurs during the warm season, or summer, rain falls mainly during the late afternoon and early evening hours. The wet season is a time when air quality improves, freshwater quality improves, and vegetation grows significantly.|$|E

5|$|Extratropical {{cyclones}} form along linear {{bands of}} temperature/dewpoint gradient with significant vertical wind shear, {{and are thus}} classified as baroclinic cyclones. Initially, cyclogenesis, or low pressure formation, occurs along frontal zones near a favorable quadrant of a maximum in the upper level jetstream known as a jet streak. The favorable quadrants are usually at the right rear and left front quadrants, where divergence ensues. The divergence causes air to rush out {{from the top of}} the air column. As mass in the column is reduced, atmospheric pressure at surface level (the weight of the air column) is reduced. The lowered pressure strengthens the cyclone (a low pressure system). The lowered pressure acts to draw in air, creating convergence in the low-level wind field. Low-level convergence and upper-level divergence imply upward motion within the column, making cyclones tend to be cloudy. As the cyclone strengthens, the cold front sweeps towards the equator and moves around the back of the cyclone. Meanwhile, its associated warm front progresses more slowly, as the cooler air ahead of the system is denser, and therefore more difficult to dislodge. Later, the cyclones occlude as the poleward portion of the cold front overtakes a section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> front, forcing a tongue, or trowal, of warm air aloft. Eventually, the cyclone will become barotropically cold and begin to weaken.|$|E

25|$|The {{climate of}} North Carolina is mild and equable. This {{is due in}} part to its {{geographical}} position; midway in the Northern Hemisphere. Also, the high Appalachian chain offers, to some extent, a shield from cold winter winds of the northwest. On the ocean side, in winter, is the moderating influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> Gulf Stream, the current of which sweeps along near its shores.|$|E

25|$|The {{range of}} pignut hickory {{encompasses}} 7 orders, 12 suborders, and 22 great groups of soils (24,25). About {{two-thirds of the}} species range is dominated by Ultisols, which are low in bases and have subsurface horizons of clay accumulation. They are usually moist but are dry during part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> season. Udults is the dominant suborder and Hapludults and Paleudults are the dominant great groups. These soils are derived {{from a variety of}} parent materials-sedimentary and metamorphic rocks, glacial till, and in places varying thickness of loess-which vary in age from Precambrian to Quaternary.|$|E
25|$|South Fremont is a {{primarily}} industrial district, east of Interstate 880 {{and west}} of Interstate 680, south of Auto Mall Parkway and north of Brown Rd. The area overlaps with Warm Springs, with which it shares the eponymous BART station. The composition of the area will change, because thousands of residential units were under construction as of 2016. It is sandwiched between the Irvington and Warm Springs community plan areas. It is noted {{as the site of}} the Tesla Factory as well as the site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Warm</b> Springs / South Fremont BART station.|$|E

25|$|Waterloo has a humid {{continental}} climate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> summer subtype (Dfb under the Köppen climate classification); {{this means that}} there are large seasonal differences, usually very warm to hot (and humid) summers and cold (to very cold) winters. Compared {{to the rest of}} Canada, it has moderate weather. Winter temperatures generally last from the middle of December until the middle of March, while summer temperatures generally occur between the middle of May to close to the end of September. Temperatures can exceed 30℃ (86℉) several times a year. Waterloo has approximately 140 frost-free days per year.|$|E
25|$|By way of {{contrast}} {{and due to}} a shared dreaming, {{the relationship between the}} Ngarrindjeri and the Walkandi-woni (the people <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> north-east wind), their collective name for the various groups living along the River as far as Wentworth in New South Wales, was of significant mutual importance and the groups regularly met at Wellington, Tailem Bend, Murray Bridge, Mannum or Swan Reach to exchange songs and conduct ceremonies. Quarrels with the Walkandi-woni were not unknown and in 1849 the Rev George Taplin recorded a fight between 500 Ngarrindjeri and up to 800 Ngaiawang who shared a border with them at Mannum.|$|E
25|$|Frontal and {{cyclonic}} lift {{occur when}} stable air is forced aloft at weather fronts and around centers of low pressure. Warm fronts associated with extratropical cyclones tend to generate mostly cirriform and stratiform clouds {{over a wide}} area unless the approaching warm airmass is unstable, in which case cumulus congestus or cumulonimbus clouds will usually be embedded in the main precipitating cloud layer. Cold fronts are usually faster moving and generate a narrower line of clouds which are mostly stratocumuliform, cumuliform, or cumulonimbiform depending on the stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> air mass {{just ahead of the}} front.|$|E
