30|$|One of the {{important}} approaches to having high power density in a fuel cell {{is to reduce the}} internal losses. The internal losses can always be attributed to the three types of polarizations [1]: activation polarization, concentration polarization, and <b>ohmic</b> <b>polarization.</b> As these polarizations increase, the overpotential can become too large for the fuel cell to produce a high power density with reasonably high energy efficiency [2, 3, 4]. The minimization of polarization will largely depend on the mechanism that causes each specific type of polarization. The activation polarization is caused by the slowness of the electrochemical reactions taking place {{on the surface of the}} electrodes. Consequently, a proportion of the available ideal voltage is sacrificed in the electrochemical reaction. The concentration polarization is due to mass transfer resistance from bulk flow to the surface of the electrodes when fuel and oxygen are consumed and water is generated. The <b>ohmic</b> <b>polarization</b> is the straightforward resistance to the flow of electrons through the material of the electrodes and the various interconnections as well as the resistance to the flow of protons through the electrolyte.|$|E

The ion current density and the activation polarization are the highest at the electrolyte-electrode interface and decrease rapidly within the electrodes as the distance from the interface increases. However, the <b>ohmic</b> <b>polarization</b> by ion transfer increases for the positions away from the interface.

Fuel cell vehicles are one of the best solutions available today to decrease huge amounts of carbon dioxide being released. A fuel cell is a clean and green way of generating electricity from the chemical energy. This research is on the modeling of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell when used in transportation applications. Depending on the components used, there are different types of fuel cells. This thesis deals with proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) which is the most commonly used fuel cell in different applications including transportation, military and other commercial products. Since the work is based on the application of a PEMFC in transportation, a FCX Clarity fuel cell hybrid vehicle was taken into consideration and a fuel cell prototype was simulated according to the technical specifications of the Honda vehicle. MICROSIM PSPICE software has been used to simulate a PEMFC to generate the voltage-current (V-I) characteristics of a 100 KW fuel cell stack along with the three kinds of polarization. The diode model was modified in terms of its area and parasitic resistance to accommodate for the activation <b>polarization</b> and <b>ohmic</b> <b>polarizations.</b> The two transistor models were also modified in terms of its area to include large currents. The output of fuel cell will be coupled to a boost converter that regulates the output voltage to the required level. A boost converter however can inject current harmonics into the fuel cell which might otherwise damage the durability of fuel cell. Therefore an interleaved boost converter was investigated to reduce current harmonics. In this research, it has been deduced that with an interleaved boost converter, the current harmonics on fuel cells can be reduced and the output voltage levels can be increased. Further recommendations of the circuit have also been suggested that could lead to development of an efficient fuel cell vehicle.

40|$|AbstractMembrane {{electrode}} assemble (MEA) {{design is}} one of the crucial component of MFC. Therefore, the MEA design is critical to improving MFC's performance. In this work, effects of the presence of the cathode microporous layers and the distance between anode and cathode electrodes on MFC's performance are investigated. The experimental result indicates that the peak power density first decreases from 973 to 797 mW/m 2 when decreasing the distance from 2 to 1 cm, and then increases to 955 mW/m 2 when further reducing the distance to 0 cm. Meanwhile the ohmic resistance of the MFCs decreases from 34 to 14 and to 4. 6 Ω with the reduced distance. This is because that the peak power density is improved by increasing the anode potential and decreasing the ohmic loss due to the reduced distance. However, when distance reduced from 1 to 0 cm, the decrease of cathode potential becomes the predominant factor. It is also found that the aerobic heterotrophic microorganism growing on the surface of both the proton exchange membrane and the anode electrode lowers the coulomb efficiency by consuming the organic substance. In addition, the presence of aerobic bacteria is the possible factor that induces the non-linear correlation between the <b>ohmic</b> <b>polarization</b> and electrodes distance...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{catalysts}} in vanadium flow batteries (VFBs) {{has been}} studied by introducing bismuth (Bi) nanoparticles on carbon felt (CF) and graphite felt (GF). The electrocatalytic activity and VFBs performance of CF and GF before and after modification with Bi nanoparticles are investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and VFB single cell charge-discharge test. The results show that CF exhibits the much higher electrocatalytic activity than GF, due to its higher amount of C-OH and quaternary nitrogen groups and more defect sites. Bi nanoparticles can effectively improve the electrocatalytic activity of CF and GF, especially GF, towards V 2 +/V 3 + redox couple in VFBs. As a result, energy efficiency of a VFB with GF, electrodes can be improved significantly by modification with Bi due to the dramatically reduced electrochemical polarization. However, the energy efficiency of a VFB with CF electrodes rarely changes after introduction of Bi nanoparticles, {{due to the fact}} that dominant limitation in a VFB with CF electrodes is <b>ohmic</b> <b>polarization,</b> and the reduced charge transfer resistance is not enough to improve the performance of this VFB remarkably.

The electrochemical stability window of commercial carbonate-base electrolytes is from cathodic limit 0. 8 V to anodic limit 4. 3 V vs. Li/Li+. The oxidation decomposition of carbonate electrolytes prevents realization of 5. 0 V-class high voltage of Li-ion battery (LIB) because of problems such as capacity fading by decomposition of electrolytes and the Mn-dissolution of cathodes. In this thesis, Multi-layer electrolyte cell (MEC) has improved the electrochemical high voltage stability and thermal stability by introducing an ionic liquid electrolyte as the cathode-side electrolyte. The ionic liquid electrolyte has high electrochemical stability for high potential oxidative reaction compared to a carbonate-base electrolyte and thermal stability. The first MEC model has improved the stability of high potential and elevated temperature, but it has low reversible capacity compared to commercial electrolyte coin-cell. This is caused by the polarization losses: 1) activation polarization, 2) concentration polarization and 3) <b>Ohmic</b> <b>polarization.</b> The <b>Ohmic</b> <b>polarization</b> is caused by the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte, electronic resistance of the active materials and current collectors and the interfacial resistance between them. MEC has high internal resistance of multi-layer electrolyte because the ionic liquid electrolyte and ceramic electrolyte pellet have interfacial resistance between them. We expanded the contact surface with porous LTAP pellet and ionic liquid to reduce the internal resistance of MEC. The porous type MEC has enhanced reversible capacity and good stability for high potential and temperature at low C-rate. MEC designs have intrinsic high internal resistance compared to commercial LIB, so the composition electrolyte of MEC should be develop their ionic conductivity and good interfacial resistance. The graphite anode forms the SEI layer (Solid electrolyte interphase) consuming the reversible lithium ion in LIB because the electrochemical stability window of the electrolyte is higher than the redox potential of graphite. The ceramic electrolyte Li 1. 3 Ti 1. 7 Al 0. 3 (PO 4) 3 (LTAP) materials could provide an additional lithium source to recover the capacity of LIB full-cell. They have NASICON – type structure of two Li sites M 1, M 2. The M 1 site is occupied by existing Li+ ion, additional Li+ ions can be inserted into the vacant M 2 site. After the first charge cycle, LTAP has ionic conductivity 10 - 4 S/cm, so it helps lithium ion conduct inside the cell. LTAP materials provide an additional lithium source about 110 mAh/g. The contribution of lithium source material is confirmed by applying to graphite / LiCoO 2 full-cell.

The Darcy-Brinkman equation enables continuous pressure and velocity fields over the electrode/gas channel interfaces. The electrochemical reaction model is extended from zero-dimension (with only an average value defined) in the early models, to one-dimension covering the variation in current density along the flow direction. Finally a two-dimensional approach including the current density distribution, both along the flow direction and through the electrolyte-electrodes, is developed. The model relies on experimental data from a standard cell developed at Ningbo Institute of Material Technology & Engineering (NIMTE) in China. The anode microscopic structure and catalytic characteristics {{have a major impact on}} the internal reforming reaction rates and also on the cell performance. The large difference between the different activation energies and reaction kinetics found in the open literature may be due to the fact that several parameters probably have a significance influence on the reaction rate. Heat is generated due to ohmic, activation and concentration polarizations within the electrolyte and electrodes as well as change of entropy in the cathodic electrochemical reactions. Heat is consumed due to the change of entropy in the anodic electrochemical reactions and the steam reforming reactions within the anode. The activation polarizations in the electrodes and the <b>ohmic</b> <b>polarization</b> due to ion transport in the YSZ material are found to be the major part of the polarizations. The activation polarization is the most significant and as the electrochemical model is extended from one- to two-dimensions, the activation polarization within the cathode becomes smaller than the one within the anode. This difference might be explained by different current density per (active TPB) area and variable area-to-volume-ratios for the electrochemical reactions within the anode and cathode, respectively. The current density and the activation polarization are the highest at the electrolyte-electrode interface and decreases rapidly within the electrodes as the distance from the interface increases. However, the <b>ohmic</b> <b>polarization</b> by ion transfer increases for the positions away from the interface...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} much effort was spent for the {{detailed}} {{understanding of the}} electrochemical behavior of SOFC single cells. However, these results can only hardly {{be transferred to the}} SOFC stack technology because of huge differences in fuel utilization, in temperature distribution, in gas flow design and in electrical current load. Therefore, proper and detailed understanding of the electrochemical behavior of the SOFC stacks is obligatory for the successful introduction and acceptance of the SOFC technology into the global energy market. The paper presents both experimental and modeling results of the electrochemical behavior of SOFC short stacks with anode supported cells (ASC) in the cassette design at different operating conditions. The focus lies on the investigation of the different resistances and the voltage losses in the stack layers, which can be classified in <b>ohmic,</b> electrode <b>polarization</b> and gas concentration ones. The influence of the different operation conditions, e. g. temperature, current density and fuel utilization is outlined. The stacks were investigated by current-voltage curves, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), gas analysis and long term measurements. Results of both integral and locally resolved measurements along the fuel gas flow path are presented. The modeling results were obtained with a two dimensional elementary kinetic model which represents a single cell along the gas channels and through the thickness of the membrane-electrode assembly...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of microporous layer (MPL) {{on the performance of}} a high-temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell utilizing a phosphoric-acid-doped polybenzimidazole (PBI) electrolyte. The effects of MPL compositions including polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) and carbon black are considered. Under the same catalyst loading, phosphoric acid doping level, and operation conditions, the fuel cell performance is measured to evaluate the importance of MPL and determine the optimal PTFE content and carbon loading. The method of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is employed to characterize the variations in the <b>ohmic</b> resistance and <b>polarization</b> losses within the cell. The results show that both the PTFE content and carbon loading in the MPL may affect the cell performance significantly. The MPL with a PTFE content of 40 wt % and carbon loading of 1. 0 mg cm- 2 is found to give the optimal cell performance...|$|R
40|$|Solid Oxide Fuel Cells are envisioned {{to offer}} an {{attractive}} alternative for the combined generation of electricity and heat, especially for stationary applications. Although commercial systems using these fuel cells {{are available in the}} market, the disadvantages associated with their high costs and limited lifetimes continue to hinder their widespread usage. In this thesis, the latter issue is tackled by addressing specific degradation mechanisms that occur in these fuel cells. Focus is on single components from the anode side of the fuel cell stack assembly. The components from the anode side are subjected to conditions that would normally be prevalent during typical operational loads. Components from the anode side of the stack include a Ni-mesh as a current collector, Crofer 22 H as an interconnect and the NiO- 8 YSZ anode substrate with an anode functional layer as the electrode. Parameters such as temperature, current density and humidity in fuel gas atmosphere are varied from 700 - 800 °C, 0 - 0. 7 A. cm- 2 and 3 - 80 % H 2 O in H 2 respectively. The resistance contributions from the components and their interfaces are measured using experimental methods such as 4 probe DC resistivity and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Long term tests up to 1000 hours and short term tests ranging from 0 - 300 hours are carried out along with thermal/redox cycles to monitor these resistances. In this way, using both experimental techniques, the <b>ohmic</b> and <b>polarization</b> resistance contributions are measured, and the influence of changing operating parameters on degradation are evaluated. It is observed that the ohmic resistance offered by the Ni-mesh – interconnect interface and the interconnect-anode substrate interface is very low and suffer insignificant degradation over the tested periods. Regardless of change in temperature and the presence of high humidity in the fuel gas, the resistance contribution remains low. Even the thermal cycles, interdiffusion of elements, nickel oxidation and the buildup of oxide scales did not aggravate the resistances. Post test microscopic analysis revealed several metallic contact points at these interfaces offering a parallel path for the low resistance conduction of current. On the other hand, impedance measurements using symmetric anode cells helped in isolating the <b>ohmic</b> and <b>polarization</b> resistances as a function of operating parameters. Both types of resistances offered by the anode-electrolyte interface are found to increase with time. In addition, thermal cycling is also found to be a source for substantial degradation for this interface. However, the presence of artefacts and inductive effects possibly due to the positioning of the reference electrode lead to distortion and ‘scaling’ of the spectra from the individual electrodes. Hence the exact magnitudes of the resistances obtained from the impedance measurements are prone to errors and therefore provide qualitative information. Finally, areas for future investigations on degradation are identified and corrective measures for obtaining reliable and reproducible measurements are recommended...|$|R
