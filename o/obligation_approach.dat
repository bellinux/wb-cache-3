50|$|Damages on {{the account}} of {{personal}} physical injury, physical sickness and workers compensation are income tax free due to exclusions provided in IRC section 104. The structured settlement tax rules enacted by Congress lay down a bright line path for a structured settlement. Once the plaintiff and defense have settled the tort claim in exchange for periodic payments {{to be made by}} the defendant (or the defendant's insurer), the full amount of the periodic payments constitutes tax-free damages to the victim. The defendant, or its insurer, may assign its periodic payment obligation to a qualified assignment company (typically a single purpose affiliate of a life insurer) that funds its assumed obligation with an annuity purchased from its affiliated life insurer. The rules also permit the assignee to fund its periodic payment obligation under the structured settlement via U.S. Treasury obligations. However, this U.S. Treasury <b>obligation</b> <b>approach</b> is used much less frequently because of lower returns and the relative inflexibility of payment schedules available under Treasury obligations. In this way, with a qualified assignment, there is a legal novation, the defendant or insurer can close its books on the liability, and the claimant can receive the long-term financial security of an annuity (or annuities) issued by one or more financially strong life insurance companies.|$|E

Impacts of individual variants of approaches into the income statement and statement of financial position are analyzed. It turns out that apparently it is not possible to apply only one approach (as it is in the case of lessee), without gross distortion of the financial position of the lessor. Some of the options of derecognition approach truly shows the situation, especially in long-term leases and leases where the risks and rewards associated with the lease are transferred to the lessee, for the other leases it is recommended sometimes to use underecognition property from the assets of the lessor during the lease period, but rather report a liability to leave to lessee to use (performance <b>obligations</b> <b>approach).</b> Compared with the current method of recording an operating lease, this approach without taking into account the cost of maintenance leads to another course of reporting profits (rise in the early stages against the growth in the final stages), but also brings a more fundamental problem, and it is overvaluation of lessor’s assets. In addition, it is possible to doubt about the correctness to report such liability as an unconditional liability. The approach is also not consistent with the IASB and the FASB project that is devoted to the recognition of revenues. The possible way, according to author’s opinion, might be regulation of existing model of reporting operating lease or derecognition approach...|$|R

This issue {{should be taken}} into account when modeling, for computational handling, contractual commitments through obligations. Deadline obligations have been modeled by considering that reaching the deadline without compliance brings up a violation.

We argue in favor of a directed deadline <b>obligation</b> <b>approach,</b> taking inspiration on international legislation over trade procedures. Our proposal to model contractual obligations is based on authorizations granted in specific states of an obligation lifecycle model, which we formalize using temporal logic and implement in a rule-based system. The performance of a contractual relationship is supported by a model of flexible deadlines, which allow for further cooperation between autonomous agents. As a result, the decision-making space of agents concerning contractual obligations is enlarged and becomes richer.

Emerson and Yancey answer this tension with the innovative, complex and accessible Transcending Racial Barriers: Toward a Mutual <b>Obligation</b> <b>Approach.</b> This book provides a unique, insightful and memorable take on the problem of race by focusing on an under-studied facet of race relations: solutions. Despite persistent and growing evidence that race matters in the post-civil rights age, effective solutions are in short supply, and as the authors argue, mostly because we are in dire need of a shared mandate. The authors aim to adjust the lens through which individuals view current racial dynamics by offering a new approach to racial problem solving called “mutual obligations. ” Part I lays out the need for the mutual obligations approach.

The paper suggests that Sen's development of a 'scholarly bridge' between human rights and economics is an important and innovative contribution that has methodological as well as substantive importance and that provides a prototype and stimuli for future research.

Since virtualization, despite its benefits incurs a performance penalty, which could be significant for systems dealing with uncertainty such as High Performance Computing (HPC) applications where jobs have tight deadlines and have dependencies on other jobs before they could run. The major obstacle lies in bridging the gap between performance requirements of a job and performance offered by the virtualization technology if the jobs were to be executed in virtual machines.

The paper aims to assess whether, and to what extent, this trend could be a proper path to enforce the legal accountability of transnational corporations for human rights. The paper argues for the following point: the interplay between law and ethics should be assessed differently depending on which kind of correlative duty is at stake. With regard to negative duties, soft law tools concerning TNCs' conduct may weaken the impact of hard law. By contrast, when positive duties are concerned, insofar as the horizontal effect of rights cannot be assumed, soft law {{turns out to be}} much more useful to diffuse a culture of genuine social responsibility of TNCs...|$|R

Once the authorities can levy such obligations, they can name what fulfills any obligation by denominating those things that can be delivered; in other words, by pricing them.

Using descriptive statistics and content analysis, we examine (1) the substantive tax concerns facing forum participants, (2) how taxes affect their driving and profitability decisions, and (3) the degree of user sophistication, accuracy of legal advising, and other cultural features of the forums. We find that while forum participants displayed generally accurate understandings of tax filing and income inclusion <b>obligations,</b> their <b>approaches</b> to expenses and deductions were less accurate and more varied in sophistication and willingness to comply with tax law. Forum participants also frequently discussed whether driving was profitable and exhibited a range of awareness concerning how taxes affected profitability. Finally, while the forums contained a surprising degree of sophisticated and accurate tax and legal advice, they also contained many examples of inaccurate or confusing information. It is thus uncertain whether forum readers were able to successfully distinguish between accurate and inaccurate advice dispensed in the forums. Based on our findings, we make tentative recommendations for effective tax administration in the ridesharing and related sectors, including use of industry-specific guidance, clarification of how existing tax rules apply to ridesharing, and guidance on Form 1099 -K interpretation.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{proposes a}} charismological reading of dynamic gifts in American culture, developing a critical yet constructive theory of gifts that {{can then be}} applied to {{a broad range of}} American writers and texts. By drawing on the work of literary pragmatists such as Ralph Waldo Emerson and William James, who intentionally situate themselves in intermediary positions between religion and secularism, I offer a more nuanced approach to the so-called "religious turn" in critical theory and literary studies. The aim of this project is to contribute to recent debates about theories of the gift and, in so doing, contributes to the fields of American literature and religion, both of which are all too often divided by narratives of secularization or an aggressive religious return. Following Jeffrey Stout's example in Democracy and Tradition and his definition of democratic piety as the proper acknowledgement of the sources of our existence and progress through life, this charismological approach to gift-theories is an attempt to engage the dynamic spiritual and secular sources that are inextricably part of American culture. As Heidegger did with the question of being, rather than focus on particular gifts as objects of circulation in culture, I am interested in a more fundamental flow of dynamic power that comes from inspirational gifts that are difficult to analyze as mere objects of exchange. By shifting the interpretive framework away from what Derrida called an "economy of exchange," which cannot but result in the annulment of the gift through debt and <b>obligation,</b> this <b>approach</b> offers an alternative, non-economic framework that interprets what I call "dynamic gifts" as sources of power, agency, and inspiration...|$|R

This paper considers whether there are {{lessons to be learned}} from more than six decades of international cooperation on trade through the GATT/WTO. It argues that in comparison to trade cooperation, the climate change negotiations are taking place against a background of great uncertainty, a long gap in time between actions and results, significant distributional issues, basic differences among parties in terms of the appropriate balance of national responsibilities for action, and sharp differences over policy approaches. All these factors make the negotiations more complex and less likely to result in the kind of detailed policy commitments that characterize the GATT/WTO. Nevertheless, the paper argues that excessive imprecision or reliance or voluntarism at the national level will result in insufficient effort to address the challenges of climate change.

40|$|Is there {{a general}} moral duty {{to obey the}} law {{because it is the}} law? This is the {{question}} of political obligation. The issue of political obligation is allegedly a central topic of political philosophy, because political obligation is often assumed to be necessary for state legitimacy; that is to say, for a state to be legitimate, it must be capable of imposing political obligation on the governed. Nonetheless, the literature has indicated that it is enormously difficult, at least within the liberal doctrine that many find most attractive, to justify political obligation. Given that political obligation is viewed as an indispensable part of state legitimacy, skepticism about political obligation points to a seemingly inescapable yet disturbing conclusion: no existing liberal state is legitimate, no matter how just it is. This skeptical position is also known as philosophical anarchism. This study aims to show that philosophical anarchism is not as irresistible as it appears. But I do not take the traditional approach of refuting philosophical anarchism by defending or developing theories of political obligation. On the contrary, I devote the first part of my thesis to consolidating the skepticism about political <b>obligation.</b> The <b>approach</b> I favor is to argue that political obligation is not necessary for state legitimacy. If this point can be established, then even if political obligation is unjustified, it will not automatically lead to philosophical anarchism. This constitutes the second part of my thesis, where I develop a conception of “legitimacy without political obligation” and defend it against the objection that it is either conceptually or morally wrong to claim that a legitimate state need not impose political obligation on its subjects. published_or_final_versionPolitics and Public AdministrationDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

The findings show a temporal transfer of policy motives underpinning key land use changes, from agriculture supporting local livelihoods (up to the late 1970 's) to maximizing economic values of land through commercial aquaculture (1980 's- 1999), and finally to ecological restoration and protection (1999 onwards). Each land use change brought new challenges at the local scale. Socio-economic assessments revealed that the demolition of aquaculture ponds (2006) prompted changes in livelihood strategies. Some households diversified their livelihoods (e. g. fishing)), while compensation packages helped this diversification in some instances.

Fixed Income, 2000, 9, 43 – 54]. However, this model is limited in that its framework is completely static, failing to capture the dynamic evolution of the CDO. In general, portfolio credit derivatives are subject to two kinds of risk, a default event risk, when any underlying firm involved in the CDO fails to fulfill its obligations, and credit spread risk, due to the change of the default intensity over time. In dealing with either type of risk, it is absolutely necessary to develop a dynamic model incorporating the stochastic behavior of the macro-economic conditions and their influence on the default intensity. In this paper, a dynamic stochastic model is developed where the macro-economic conditions are assumed to follow a birth–death process, which would affect loss distributions characterized by a Markov-modulated Poisson process (MMPP). By exploiting the stochastic structure of the MMPP, efficient computational procedures are established for evaluating time-dependent loss distributions and prices of the CDO. Numerical results are presented, demonstrating the potential usefulness of the model by estimating the underlying parameters based on real market data...|$|R

Synonymous with household food insecurity, the issue needs to be located within a social justice framework. Recognising the clear interdependence between the right to food and the right to health, this paper explores how international human rights <b>obligations</b> could inform <b>approaches</b> to addressing food poverty and insecurity with specific reference to Ireland and the UK. Little {{attention has been paid to}} how countries should meet their obligations to respect, protect and fulfil the right to food in developed countries. The paper contributes by examining the social and policy circumstances which inhibit poor households from obtaining sufficient food to eat healthily, along with strategies and interventions from State and civil society actors in the two countries. In practice, problems and potential solutions have largely been directed towards the individual rather than at social determinants, particularly as research on environmental factors such as distance to shops has produced equivocal results. Other key structural aspects such as income sufficiency for food are broadly ignored by the State, and anti-poverty strategies are often implemented without monitoring for effects on food outcomes. Thus scant evidence exists for either Ireland or the UK meeting its rights to food obligations to date, in terms of roles and responsibilities in ensuring access to affordable, available and appropriate food for all...|$|R
40|$|As {{financial}} disclosure {{in the highly}} globalised financial markets serves to equalise market opportunities, poor and inaccurate disclosure leads to inequality among investors, governments, and institutions. There has been a steady but rather slow process of harmonisation of national sanctions for companies breaching their disclosure obligations. Without compromising the potential efficiency of these harmonisation measures, included in the Prospectus, Transparency and Market Abuse Directives, this paper aims to create and propose an alternative method {{to increase the efficiency}} of sanctions in corporate law. By focusing on the importance of time, as an element that influences - at least in theory - corporate decisions in relation to the eventual breach of disclosure obligations, this paper seeks to re-conceptualise the importance of sanctions in this area and to link their severity to the element of time that is potentially instrumentalised by listed companies. In this study, we argue that linking sanctions and time should prompt the legal framework to accentuate the severity of sanctions imposed in certain circumstances, while also adopting a differentiated approach to the types of sanctions imposed for the breach of specific disclosure <b>obligations.</b> This novel <b>approach</b> proposes to accentuate the targeting function of sanctions by associating them with the violation of different types of disclosure obligations and to create indirectly a de facto harmonisation trend amongst regulators and judges at the national level. This will become feasible through the creation of specific "aggravating circumstances" in the area of disclosure obligations, which will allow more severe sanctions to be imposed and national frameworks to converge gradually.   If listed companies are sanctioned in a more targeted way when they violate disclosure obligations, the inequality between their strategies and the need for reliable information will gradually decrease. This novel approach proposes to accentuate the targeting function of sanctions and therefore tackle inequality in capital markets expressed by informational asymmetry and lack of sophistication...|$|R
40|$|Formal {{methods are}} {{mathematical}} techniques used for developing large systems. The complexity of growing systems pose an increasing {{challenge in the}} task of formal development and requires a significant improvement of formal techniques and tool support. Event-B is a formal method used for modelling and reasoning about systems. The Rodin platform is an open tool that supports Event-B specification and verification. This research aims to address some challenges in modelling complex systems. The main challenges addressed in this thesis cover three aspects: The first aspect focuses on providing a way to manage the complexity of large systems. The second aspect focuses on bridging {{the gap between the}} requirements and the formal models. The third aspect focuses on supporting the reuse of models and their proofs. To address the first challenge, we have attempted to simplify the task of formal development of large systems using a compositional technique. The compositional technique aims at dividing the system into smaller parts starting from requirements, followed on by a construction of the specification of each part in isolation, and then finally composing these parts together to model the overall behaviour of the system. We classified the requirements into two categories: The first category consists of a different set of requirements, each of which describes a particular component of the system. The second category describes the composition requirements that show how components interact with each other. The first category is used to construct Event-B specification of each component separately from other components. The second category is used to show the interaction of the separated models using the composition technique. To address the second and the third challenges, we proposed two techniques in this thesis. The first technique supports construction of a formal model from informal requirements with the aim of retaining traceability to requirements in models. This approach makes use of the UML-B and atomicity decomposition (AD) approaches. UML-B provides the UML graphical notation that enables the development of an Event-B formal model, while the AD approach provides a graphical notation to illustrate the refinement structures and assists in the organisation of refinement levels. The second technique supports the reusability of Event-B formal models and their respective proof <b>obligations.</b> This <b>approach</b> adopts generic instantiation and composition approaches to form a new methodology for reusing existing Event-B models into the development process of other models. Generic instantiation technique is used to create an instance of a pattern that consists of refinement chain in a way that preserves proofs while composition is used to enable the integration of several sub-models into a large model. FreeRTOS (real-time operating system) was selected as a case study to identify and address the above mentioned general problems in the formal development of complex systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to compare Finnish law, English law and the CISG on how the methods of {{contract}} interpretation and supplementation ascertain contractual obligations. In other words, how a tribunal is required to examine and reason whether a contractual obligation {{to act in a}} certain way exists between the parties. The focus is on commercial contracts concluded in writing. First, this thesis examines Finnish law, English law and the CISG in separate chapters by using a structure that will reveal terminological and theoretical similarities and differences by analysing the theoretical basis of the methods as well as the main principles based on them. This part covers topics, such as what is meant under each law with interpretation and supplementation, the subjective and the objective theoretical approaches {{as well as with the}} intent of the parties and understanding of a reasonable person. Second, a comparison is made and conclusions are drawn on how the differences revealed in this thesis may affect a tribunal’s process of interpreting and supplementing a contract. Finally, the overall functionality of the methods is evaluated against the premise that they are expected to guide a tribunal to solve a contract dispute with the best possible outcome. The results of the comparison show that despite the methods under the laws reassemble each other and even use similar terminology, they include remarkable differences that can be traced to be based on the differences in the underlying theories. The difference causing most practical consequences appeared to be in the perspective of how words and expressions used by the parties should be understood. Mainly the question is whereas the words should be understood based on their ordinary meaning or by taking into account the context in which they were used. The evaluation of the functionality of the methods showed that all the laws can be set under certain criticism. It was seen as problematic in this thesis that the laws place the focus excessively on the parties’ communication when ascertaining the contractual <b>obligations.</b> This <b>approach</b> appeared not to properly take into account the fact that languages and human communication are always speculative because they lack a mathematic precision. This feature leads to the situation that interpretation based on parties’ communication will always guide to several different and even random consequences without properly considering what would be the best solution for the contractual dispute. Due to the unpredictability of these methods by law it is suggested in this thesis that contracting parties expressly regulate themselves how a tribunal should interpret and supplement the contract in their specific case. This could be done for example by stating specific values and goals that should be taken into account in order to limit the unpredictability of the interpretation and supplementation results...|$|R
40|$|The idea {{of human}} rights is {{connected}} to the modern perception of law founded on subjectivity, in the context of which rights are authorizations of individual action versus a higher authority, resulting in a subjectivity of law. The huge importance of the thomistic perception of the person is connected with the issue of relations between the individual and society, as well as relations between law and state, since Thomas Aquinas foresaw what we call ‘rights of man’. Thus, the person, in a metaphysical context, is associated with natural order, since natural sociability forms the basis of a person’s supernatural fulfillment. Because of his social nature, the person is also a carrier of social relations and a product of his own encounter with other persons. In this way, Thomas Aquinas makes a synthesis of man per se, as part of mankind, and man as a person vis-à-vis others in the sphere of justice, consisting ‘in rendering to each one his right’. Ius is a relation of justice concerning what is right (iustum) {{from the point of view}} of the other, “to whom something is due. ” Aquinas can be considered a forerunner {{of human rights}} of the modern era, as demonstrated by the issue of natural equity, the issue of unjust law and obedience and the issue of political legitimization. In this framework, “human” or “natural” rights are considered moral rights. However, in the sphere of law they are perceived only within the community and common good, by no means constituting exclusive and absolute rights but only rights corresponding with duties and <b>obligations.</b> The Thomistic <b>approach</b> expresses both the free side of man vis-à-vis the state and its structures (in the spiritual level) and the egalitarian demand of law within social relations. Furthermore, it places the sphere of law on the background of common good and common interest. The Thomistic approach of the human person is a response to the modern perception of legal subjectivity and the priority of individuals, associated with the ideology of rights and leading to a confrontation of individual and society and a division of man to natural man and citizen, a product of the antithesis between society and state...|$|R
