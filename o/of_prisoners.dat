5|$|Ginetta Sagan (June 1, 1925 – August 25, 2000) was an Italian-born American {{human rights}} activist {{best known for her}} work with Amnesty International on behalf <b>of</b> <b>prisoners</b> of conscience.|$|E
5|$|Instances of {{war crimes}} were alleged to have {{occurred}} {{on both sides of}} the conflict, and troops from both the UN and North Korea were involved in several high-profile incidents. The North Korean troops, in occupying South Korea, were accused of many instances of abuse <b>of</b> <b>prisoners</b> of war captured during the fighting. Most serious among these were accusations that some captured UN prisoners were tortured and executed. Isolated incidents <b>of</b> <b>prisoners</b> being beaten, castrated, burned to death, and used for bayonet practice arose. In the Taegu region, groups of captured soldiers were found executed with their hands bound. This was also known to have occurred at Masan, where isolated instances <b>of</b> <b>prisoners</b> being used as human shields against other UN troops were known to have taken place. Critically wounded UN troops were known to have been killed, and in at least one instance, unarmed chaplains and medics were attacked despite wearing proper identification. The North Koreans were also known to have forcibly conscripted South Korean civilians into their armies on a large scale, killing any who attempted to desert.|$|E

5|$|Ultimately, three SS {{guards were}} killed — {{one of whom}} was burned alive by the prisoners in the oven of Crematorium II — and 451 Sonderkommandos were killed. Hundreds <b>of</b> <b>prisoners</b> escaped, but were all soon {{captured}} and executed, along with an additional group who participated in the revolt. Crematorium IV was destroyed in the fighting, and a group <b>of</b> <b>prisoners</b> in the gas chamber of Crematorium V was spared in the chaos.|$|E
5|$|While {{some were}} {{executed}} quickly, others were tortured before being killed. The public torture <b>of</b> <b>prisoners</b> was a traditional ritual in many tribes of the Eastern Woodlands. Captives {{might have to}} endure excruciating torture for hours and even days. The British Indian Department used its influence to discourage the killing and torturing <b>of</b> <b>prisoners,</b> with some success, but in 1782 the Indians revived the practice of ritual torture in order to exact revenge for the slaughter at Gnadenhütten.|$|E

5000|$|From about 6,200 cemeteries for German <b>prisoners</b> <b>of</b> war 180 were reconstructed (state: 2011). All cemeteries for <b>prisoners</b> <b>of</b> war {{can not be}} maintained.

5|$|At Stalag Luft III Marcinkus {{became an}} active member of an {{underground}} group <b>of</b> <b>prisoners</b> who organized and executed the Great Escape. Marcinkus was responsible for analyzing the German railway schedules– {{a vital part of the}} plan. On the night of 25 March 1944, Marcinkus became one of 76 servicemen who escaped the prison camp. After several days he was recaptured by the Gestapo and executed.|$|E
5|$|Before dawn on August 17, {{troops from}} both the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 5th Cavalry Regiment, {{supported}} by A Company of the 70th Tank Battalion, attacked Hill 303, but heavy North Korean mortar fire stopped them {{at the edge of}} Waegwan. During the morning, American artillery heavily bombarded the North Korean positions on the hill. Throughout the morning of August 17 the North Korean guards exchanged fire with U.S. troops attempting to rescue the prisoners. Around 12:00 the North Korean unit holding the Americans placed them in a gully on the hill with a light company of 50 guards. Several more American prisoners were added to the group during the day, bringing the number <b>of</b> <b>prisoners</b> on Hill 303 to 45. One survivor estimated that the total number <b>of</b> <b>prisoners</b> was 67, and that the balance of the prisoners were executed on August 15 or 16.|$|E
5|$|For {{wives and}} {{families}} <b>of</b> <b>prisoners</b> of war, life under the occupation was particularly hard. In pre-war France, the husband was generally the household's chief wage earner, so many households saw {{a sharp drop}} in income and living standards.|$|E
40|$|On 9 November 2013 the <b>Prisoner</b> <b>of</b> War Network, in {{conjunction}} with the War and Representation Network (WAR-Net), brought together forty academics and researchers at the University of Warwick to discuss ‘Representations <b>of</b> <b>Prisoner</b> <b>of</b> War Experience’. In response to Paul Gready’s claim that ‘to be a prisoner is to be variously written’, scholars from across Europe and North America and a wide range of disciplines (including history, film, politics, literature, history of art and archaeology) discussed the fascinating work being done in the emergent field <b>of</b> <b>prisoner</b> <b>of</b> war studies, as well as the possible future directions and challenges for such research.  Eighteen speakers approached the question of the representation <b>of</b> <b>prisoner</b> <b>of</b> war experience, both by the historical actors who underwent forced dislocation (captors and captives alike) and by researchers themselves.   Image: David Thompson (flikr)  </div...|$|R

5|$|It {{became clear}} that Auschwitz was not a normal {{internment}} camp with above-average SS rations, but that it served an additional function. Gröning was informed that money taken from interned Jews was not actually returned to them. When he inquired further, his colleagues confirmed that the Jews were being systematically exterminated and that this had included the transport <b>of</b> <b>prisoners</b> who had arrived the previous night.|$|E
5|$|Karmal's {{three most}} {{important}} promises were the general amnesty <b>of</b> <b>prisoners,</b> the promulgation of the Fundamental Principles of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and {{the adoption of a}} new flag containing the traditional black, red and green (the flag of Taraki and Amin was red). His government granted concessions to religious leaders and the restoration of confiscated property. Some property, which was confiscated during earlier land reforms, was also partially restored. All these measures, {{with the exception of the}} general amnesty <b>of</b> <b>prisoners,</b> were introduced gradually. Of 2,700 prisoners, 2,600 were released from prison; 600 of these were Parchamites. The general amnesty was greatly publicized by the government. While the event was hailed with enthusiasm by some, many others greeted the event with disdain, since their loved ones or associates had died during earlier purges. Amin had planned to introduce a general amnesty on 1 January 1980, to coincide with the PDPA's sixteenth anniversary.|$|E

5|$|Prisoners {{had little}} effect on the {{resistance}} in France. Initially there were three resistance networks based around repatriated prisoners split along political lines, but in March 1944, the three merged to form the National Movement <b>of</b> <b>Prisoners</b> of War and Deportees.|$|E
5|$|Spanish {{weaponry}} {{and tactics}} differed greatly {{from that of}} the indigenous peoples of Guatemala. This included the Spanish use of crossbows, firearms (including muskets and cannon), war dogs and war horses. Among Mesoamerican peoples the capture <b>of</b> <b>prisoners</b> was a priority, while to the Spanish such taking <b>of</b> <b>prisoners</b> was a hindrance to outright victory. The inhabitants of Guatemala, for all their sophistication, lacked key elements of Old World technology, {{such as the use of}} iron and steel and functional wheels. The use of steel swords was perhaps the greatest technological advantage held by the Spanish, although the deployment of cavalry helped them to rout indigenous armies on occasion. The Spanish were sufficiently impressed by the quilted cotton armour of their Maya enemies that they adopted it in preference to their own steel armour. The conquistadors applied a more effective military organisation and strategic awareness than their opponents, allowing them to deploy troops and supplies in a way that increased the Spanish advantage.|$|E
