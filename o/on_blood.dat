5|$|The {{three species}} of vampire bats {{are the only}} mammals that have evolved to feed {{exclusively}} <b>on</b> <b>blood.</b>|$|E
5|$|The three known {{species of}} vampire bats all seem {{more similar to}} one another than to any other species. That {{suggests}} that sanguivorous habits (feeding <b>on</b> <b>blood)</b> evolved only once, and the three species share a common ancestor.|$|E
5|$|Vanadium {{compounds}} {{are poorly}} absorbed through the gastrointestinal system. Inhalation of vanadium and vanadium compounds results primarily in {{adverse effects on}} the respiratory system. Quantitative data are, however, insufficient to derive a subchronic or chronic inhalation reference dose. Other effects have been reported after oral or inhalation exposures <b>on</b> <b>blood</b> parameters, liver, neurological development, and other organs in rats.|$|E
40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} in a low-endemic and in a non-endemic area of Sudan to evaluate the specificity and efficiency of different serological antibody detection techniques for Trypanosoma brucei gambiense. Comparisons were made of the card agglutination test for trypanosomiasis (CATT) <b>on</b> diluted <b>blood,</b> <b>on</b> diluted plasma and <b>on</b> eluates from <b>blood</b> dried <b>on</b> filter paper, the LATEX test on diluted plasma and an ELISA on diluted plasma and filter paper. The specificities of all the serological tests {{were not significantly different}} from CATT <b>on</b> diluted <b>blood</b> (99. 5 %). The specificity of CATT <b>on</b> diluted <b>blood</b> was similar (99. 3 %). The highest sensitivities (100 %) were observed with CATT <b>on</b> diluted <b>blood</b> and with CATT and LATEX on diluted plasma. CATT <b>on</b> diluted <b>blood</b> was more cost-efficient than the classic test, CATT <b>on</b> whole <b>blood...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{selective}} media and incubation atmosphere on {{the isolation of}} group A beta-hemolytic streptococci were evaluated. A higher percentage of group A streptococci was isolated <b>on</b> sheep <b>blood</b> agar incubated in air than in CO 2 or anaerobic atmospheric conditions. Fewer non-group A beta-hemolytic streptococci were isolated <b>on</b> sheep <b>blood</b> agar incubated in air than in CO 2 or anaerobically. Group A streptococcal isolation was not significantly affected by different incubation atmospheres <b>on</b> sheep <b>blood</b> agar containing trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, but detection time was longer than <b>on</b> sheep <b>blood</b> agar alone. No {{significant difference was found}} between isolation of group A streptococci <b>on</b> sheep <b>blood</b> agar incubated in air and that <b>on</b> sheep <b>blood</b> agar containing trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and incubated in 5 to 10 % CO 2; however, more group A streptococci were isolated <b>on</b> sheep <b>blood</b> agar in air within 24 h. Sheep blood agar incubated at 35 degrees C in air is, therefore, recommended for the isolation of group A streptococci from throat swabs...|$|R
5|$|Argasid ticks, unlike ixodid ticks, may {{go through}} {{up to seven}} nymphal stages (instars), {{requiring}} a meal of blood each time. Their life cycles range from months to years. The adult female argasid tick can lay a few hundred to over a thousand eggs {{over the course of}} her lifetime. Larvae feed very quickly and detach to molt into nymphs. Both male and female adults feed <b>on</b> <b>blood,</b> and they mate off the host. During feeding, any excess fluid is excreted by the coxal glands, a process which is unique to argasid ticks.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as these}} and other {{television}} appearances, Morell gained several notable film roles {{towards the end of}} the 1950s. He appeared in two films which won the Academy Award for Best Picture; The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957), as Colonel Green, and Ben-Hur (1959) as Sextus. With Peter Cushing as Sherlock Holmes, he played Arthur Conan Doyle's character Doctor John H. Watson, in Hammer Film Productions' version of The Hound of the Baskervilles (also 1959). Morell was particularly keen that his portrayal of Watson should be closer to that originally depicted in Conan Doyle's stories, and away from the bumbling stereotype established by Nigel Bruce's interpretation of the role. An earlier Hammer film in which Morell appeared was The Camp <b>on</b> <b>Blood</b> Island (1957).|$|E
5|$|Bats are {{the second}} largest order of mammals (after the rodents), {{representing}} about 20% of all classified mammal species worldwide, with about 1,240 bat species divided into two suborders: the less specialized and largely fruit-eating megabats, including flying foxes, and the highly specialized and echolocating microbats. About 70% of bat species are insectivores. Most of the rest are frugivores, or fruit eaters. A few species feed from animals other than insects, with the vampire bats being hematophagous, or feeding <b>on</b> <b>blood.</b>|$|E

5|$|CGW {{said the}} in-game combat became a {{confusing}} mess once allies became involved, {{in part due}} to poor Artificial Intelligence (AI) that caused them to use powers liberally and become low <b>on</b> <b>blood</b> as a result. The AI was considered to be insufficient for the game; pathfinding failures meant allies would become stuck on environmental objects or each other during combat, use up their costliest abilities on enemies regardless of their threat, and were poor at staying alive in battle. Enemies were similarly dismissed for either not noticing the playable character in obvious circumstances or failing to respond to attacks on themselves.|$|E
5|$|Chewing lice {{live among}} the hairs or {{feathers}} of their host and feed on skin and debris, while sucking lice pierce the host's skin and feed <b>on</b> <b>blood</b> and other secretions. They usually spend their whole {{life on a}} single host, cementing their eggs, which are known as nits, to hairs or feathers. The eggs hatch into nymphs, which moult three times before becoming fully grown, a process that takes about four weeks.|$|E
5|$|Common {{side effects}} include an upset stomach. More {{significant}} side effects include stomach ulcers, stomach bleeding, and worsening asthma. Bleeding risk is greater {{among those who}} are older, drink alcohol, take other NSAIDs, or are <b>on</b> <b>blood</b> thinners. Aspirin is not recommended in the last part of pregnancy. It is not generally recommended in children with infections because of the risk of Reye's syndrome. High doses may result in ringing in the ears.|$|E

5|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} is treated with surgery {{to relieve the}} pressure inside the muscle compartment and {{reduce the risk of}} compression <b>on</b> <b>blood</b> vessels and nerves in that area. Fasciotomy is the incision of the affected compartment. Often, multiple incisions are made and left open until the swelling has reduced. At that point, the incisions are closed, often requiring debridement (removal of non-viable tissue) and skin grafting in the process. The need for fasciotomy may be decreased if mannitol is used, as it can relieve muscle swelling directly.|$|E
5|$|Cytochemical stains <b>on</b> <b>blood</b> {{and bone}} marrow smears are helpful in the {{distinction}} of AML from ALL, and in subclassification of AML. The combination of a myeloperoxidase or Sudan black stain and a nonspecific esterase stain will provide the desired information in most cases. The myeloperoxidase or Sudan black reactions are most useful in establishing the identity of AML and distinguishing it from ALL. The nonspecific esterase stain is used to identify a monocytic component in AMLs and to distinguish a poorly differentiated monoblastic leukemia from ALL.|$|E
5|$|Fleas are {{holometabolous}} insects, {{going through}} the four lifecycle stages of egg, larva, pupa, and imago (adult). In most species, neither female nor male fleas are fully mature when they first emerge but must feed <b>on</b> <b>blood</b> before they become capable of reproduction. The first blood meal triggers the maturation of the ovaries in females and {{the dissolution of the}} testicular plug in males, and copulation soon follows. Some species breed all year round while others synchronise their activities with their hosts' life cycles or with local environmental factors and climatic conditions. Flea populations consist of roughly 50% eggs, 35% larvae, 10% pupae, and 5% adults.|$|E

Mikael Åkerfeldt of Opeth and Tim Bowness of No-Man wrote lyrics and performed vocals on one track each.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of hypopituitarism is made <b>on</b> <b>blood</b> tests. Two types of blood tests {{are used to}} confirm {{the presence of a}} hormone deficiency: basal levels, where blood samples are taken–usually in the morning–without any form of stimulation, and dynamic tests, where blood tests are taken after the injection of a stimulating substance. Measurement of ACTH and growth hormone usually requires dynamic testing, whereas the other hormones (LH/FSH, prolactin, TSH) can typically be tested with basal levels. There is no adequate direct test for ADH levels, but ADH deficiency can be confirmed indirectly; oxytocin levels are not routinely measured.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} {{methoxyflurane}} on the circulatory system {{resemble those of}} diethyl ether. In dogs, methoxyflurane anesthesia causes a moderate decrease in blood pressure with minimal changes in heart rate, and no significant effect <b>on</b> <b>blood</b> sugar, epinephrine, or norepinephrine. Bleeding and increased arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) both induce further decreases in blood pressure, as well as increases in blood glucose, epinephrine and norepinephrine. In humans, methoxyflurane produces some decrease in blood pressure, but cardiac output, stroke volume, and total peripheral resistance are only minimally depressed. Its effect on the pulmonary circulation is negligible, {{and it does not}} predispose the heart to cardiac dysrhythmias.|$|E

5|$|The {{goldcrest}} is {{a host of}} {{the widespread}} moorhen flea, Dasypsyllus gallinulae, and of the louse Philopterus reguli. The amblycerous mite Ricinus frenatus has been found on the eastern goldcrest subspecies, R. r. japonensis in Japan, and {{at the other end}} of the range in birds of the nominate subspecies on the Faroes and in Spain. These lice move over the host's body, and have strong mouthparts that pierce the host's skin so that they can feed <b>on</b> <b>blood,</b> and sometimes feather material. A number of feather mites have been recorded in the genus Regulus; these mites live on fungi growing on the feathers. The fungi found on the plumage may feed on the keratin of the outer feathers or on feather oil.|$|E
5|$|The {{house sparrow}} is infested {{by a number}} of {{external}} parasites, which usually cause little harm to adult sparrows. In Europe, the most common mite found on sparrows is Proctophyllodes, the most common ticks are Argas reflexus and Ixodes arboricola, and the most common flea on the house sparrow is Ceratophyllus gallinae. A number of chewing lice occupy different niches on the house sparrow's body. Menacanthus lice occur across the house sparrow's body, where they feed <b>on</b> <b>blood</b> and feathers, while Brueelia lice feed on feathers and Philopterus fringillae occurs on the head.|$|E
5|$|The {{region has}} two major factions within it – the Enclave and the Brotherhood of Steel, {{both of whom}} differ to their {{counterparts}} in the west. While the Enclave is similar in goal to their western brethren, the eastern branch of the Brotherhood of Steel seeks to assist the people of the wasteland, though a small group rejected this and became outcasts who seek to resume their original goal of salvaging high-level technology. Other factions include a small group of former slaves who seek to inspire others for freedom by restoring the Lincoln Memorial, a group of wastelanders that feast <b>on</b> <b>blood,</b> and a group who tend and care for a region of the wastes where plants have become abundant.|$|E
