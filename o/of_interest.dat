5|$|A {{relatively}} advanced theory <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> is also presented. Cantillon {{believed that}} interest originates {{from the need}} of borrowers for capital and from the fear of loss of the lenders, meaning that borrowers have to recompense lenders for {{the risk of the}} possible insolvency of the debtor. In turn, interest is paid out of earned profits originating from the return on invested capital. While previously it was believed that the rate <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> varied inversely to the quantity of money, Cantillon posited that the rate <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> was determined by the supply and demand on the loanable funds market—an insight usually attributed to Scottish philosopher David Hume. As such, while saved money impacts the rate <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> new money that is instead used for consumption does not; Cantillon's theory <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> is therefore similar to John Maynard Keynes's liquidity preference theory.|$|E

40|$|Conflicts <b>of</b> <b>{{interests}}</b> arise due to {{the fact}} that a person’s right to demand to act in his interests imposes a duty on another person to act in such a way. Different concepts <b>of</b> conflict <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> used in various sectors and their problems are analyzed in the article. Whereas there is no unified concept <b>of</b> conflict <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> used in practice it is unclear which types of relations are regarded as conflict <b>of</b> <b>interests,</b> when conflict <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> arises and what are the solutions to it. Due to these reasons universal concept <b>of</b> conflict <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> is constructed and elements <b>of</b> conflict <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> are analyzed in this article. The concept <b>of</b> conflict <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> is discussed in the context of agency theory in the broad sense, i. e. in the legal and economic sense. Theoretical model and types <b>of</b> conflicts <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> are particularly important while trying to solve conflicts <b>of</b> <b>interests.</b> There are two main categories of solutions: preventive and managing measures. Preventive measures are intended to avoid conflict <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> before it arises and managing measures are intended to manage already risen conflict <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> and to prevent negative consequences. The article concludes with the concept <b>of</b> conflict <b>of</b> <b>interests,</b> its types and solutions...|$|R
