40|$|An {{employee}} {{stock option}} is the right an employee has to buy a share of stock at a set price {{at some time in}} the future, subject to vesting and other provisions. The dramatic growth in the use of stock <b>options</b> <b>in</b> the past decade (Hall and Murphy 2003), new Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB 2004) standards on how to account for stock <b>options</b> <b>in</b> fi rm balance sheets, new disclosure requirements for highly paid executives in U.

In keeping with the tradition of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) Conference on Research in Income and Wealth (CRIW), this chapter aims to provide a review and update on some important ques-tions <b>in</b> stock <b>options</b> research and practice, explore a variety of new and interesting data sets for the careful and credible study of {{employee stock option}}s, discuss implications of <b>options</b> <b>in</b> the national accounts, and pro...|$|R

5|$|A {{ketogenic}} diet (high-fat, low-carbohydrate, adequate-protein) {{appears to}} decrease the number of seizures and eliminate seizures in some, however further research is necessary. It is a reasonable <b>option</b> <b>in</b> those who have epilepsy that is not improved with medications and for whom surgery is not an option. About 10% stay on the diet {{for a few years}} due to issues of effectiveness and tolerability. Side effects include stomach and intestinal problems in 30%, and there are long-term concerns about heart disease. Less radical diets are easier to tolerate and may be effective. It is unclear why this diet works. Exercise has been proposed as possibly useful for preventing seizures with some data to support this claim.|$|E
5|$|A {{legal battle}} that began {{the same year}} {{interfered}} with the band's working on another release. Volcano Entertainment—the successor of Tool's by-then defunct label Zoo Entertainment—alleged contract violations by Tool and filed a lawsuit. According to Volcano, Tool had violated their contract when the band looked at offers from other record labels. After Tool filed a countersuit stating that Volcano had failed to use a renewal <b>option</b> <b>in</b> their contract, the parties settled out of court. In December 1998 Tool agreed to a new contract, a three-record joint venture deal. In 2000, the band dismissed their long-time manager Ted Gardner, who then sued the band over his commission on this lucrative agreement.|$|E
5|$|Although {{sterilization}} {{is considered}} a permanent procedure, {{it is possible to}} attempt a tubal reversal to reconnect the fallopian tubes or a vasectomy reversal to reconnect the vasa deferentia. In women the desire for a reversal is often associated with a change in spouse. Pregnancy success rates after tubal reversal are between 31 and 88 percent, with complications including an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. The number of males who request reversal is between 2 and 6 percent. Rates of success in fathering another child after reversal are between 38 and 84 percent; with success being lower the longer the time period between the original procedure and the reversal. Sperm extraction followed by in vitro fertilization may also be an <b>option</b> <b>in</b> men.|$|E

5|$|As of 2017, Monotype's current {{digitisation}} of Gill Sans is Gill Sans Nova, by George Ryan. Gill Sans Nova adds many additional variants, {{including some}} of the previously undigitised inline versions, stylistic alternates and an ultra-light weight (once an <b>option</b> <b>in</b> metal type) which had been digitised for Grazia. The fonts differ from Gill Sans MT in their adoption of the hooked 1 as default, while the regular weight is renamed 'Medium'. Monotype celebrated the release with a London exhibition on Gill's work, as they had in 1958 to mark the general release of Gill's serif design Joanna. One addition was italic swash caps, which had been considered by Gill but never released.|$|E
5|$|Bird's nest custody is an {{uncommon}} {{form of joint}} custody in which, rather than having the children go from one parent's house to the other parent's house, the parents {{move in and out}} of the house in which the children constantly reside. The goal of this arrangement is to shift the burden of upheaval and moving between homes onto the parents rather than the children. However, due to the high cost of maintaining three households, one for each parent and one for the children, it's rarely a viable <b>option</b> <b>in</b> a custody case.|$|E
5|$|By the 1850s Indiana's Republican party, whose adherents {{tended to}} favor the temperance movement, began {{challenging}} the state's Democrats, who supported personal freedom and a limited federal government, for political power. Early temperance legislation in Indiana earned only limited and temporary success. In 1853 Republicans persuaded the state legislature to pass a local option law that would allow township voters to declare their township dry, but it was later deemed unconstitutional. In 1855 a statewide prohibition law was passed, but it met the same fate as the local <b>option.</b> <b>In</b> the decades to come Protestant churches, especially the Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterians, Disciples of Christ, Quakers, and women's groups would continue to support temperance efforts and gave strong support to the mostly dry Republican Party. The Catholics, Episcopalians and Lutherans stood opposed and gave strong support to the wet Democratic Party.|$|E

Black's {{control over the}} central dark squares d4 and e5 will then be augmented by fianchettoing the bishop on g7. Meanwhile, White must {{decide whether or not}} to play 6.e4. Although this move gains space in the centre, it also gives Black a target of attack on the half-open e-file. White can deny Black this target for the time being by playing 6.Nf3 first.|$|E

Shortly after the shootings, soldiers and police officers evacuated buildings {{in the vicinity of the}} Convent, while bomb-disposal experts got to work; four hours later, the authorities announced that a car bomb had been defused, after which Savage's white Renault was towed from the car park by an army truck.
