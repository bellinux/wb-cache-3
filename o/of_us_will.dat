I’m not exaggerating....Boise State beating Oklahoma in a New Year’s Day bowl game is college football’s equivalent to George Mason reaching the Final Four, with one extremely significant difference: George Mason had its chance to compete for the national title; Boise State does not. Like it or not, Boise State 43, Oklahoma 42 just became the single biggest argument to date for a college football playoff....Not only did they get in the game, they made a major statement on behalf of their mid-major brethren that none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>will</b> soon forget.|$|E

Burdge said that she was [...] "stunned" [...] by this news and that her brother said that he had never told anyone before, because he did not think he would be believed. A message from Hastert appears in Steve Reinboldt's 1970 high school yearbook. In the interview, Burdge said that she believes the abuse stopped when her brother moved away after graduation.

Smith had by this time lost most of his former international prominence—his visit to the UK in 2004 to meet Conservative politicians was largely ignored by the British press—but he achieved new domestic popularity and eminence among Zimbabwean opposition supporters, who came to see him as an unbreakable, defiant symbol of resistance to the Mugabe government. According to RW Johnson, a speech he gave to students at the University of Zimbabwe condemning Mugabe and ZANU–PF as incompetent and corrupt [...] "gangsters" [...] earned him a standing ovation. In 2002, Smith challenged Mugabe to come with him to a township to see who got the best welcome.

500|$|His on-air {{commentary}} {{has caused}} controversy. As a commentator, Boycott has renewed his 'pull-no-punches' style {{in contrast to}} most of his fellow commentators. In particular he is known for criticising players, often in a caustic and strident style. In 2005 he mocked the Australian captain Ricky Ponting for electing to bowl first on a batsman-friendly pitch, saying he was a [...] "nice man" [...] for being so generous to the England team. In 2006, he was initially receptive to the difficulties endured by Marcus Trescothick during his periods of stress-related illness; however, he was not always as amiable. In March 2008, recently dropped Steve Harmison attacked Boycott {{in an article in}} The Mail on Sunday where he referred to Boycott as a [...] "waste of space." [...] This was in response to Boycott's statement a few days previously on 19 March 2008 that if Harmison [...] "gets a central contract this summer then a lot <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>will</b> be screaming favouritism and a total waste of money.

500|$|In general, Sullivan {{preferred}} {{to write in}} major keys. In the Savoy operas, there are only eleven substantial numbers wholly in a minor key (less than 5% of the musical numbers), and even in his serious works the major prevails. Examples of Sullivan's rare excursions into minor keys include the long E minor melody in the first movement of the Irish Symphony, [...] "Go away, madam" [...] in the Act I finale of Iolanthe (echoing Verdi and Beethoven) and the funeral march in the Act I finale of The Yeomen of the Guard. Sullivan was happy on occasion to use chords traditionally considered technically incorrect. When reproached for using consecutive fifths in Cox and Box, he replied [...] "if 5ths turn up it doesn't matter, {{so long as there}} is no offence to the ear." [...] Hughes comments that harmonic contrast in the Savoy works is enhanced by Sullivan's characteristic modulation between keys, as in [...] "Expressive glances" [...] (Princess Ida), where he smoothly negotiates E major, C sharp minor and C major, or [...] "Then one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>will</b> be a queen" [...] (The Gondoliers), where he writes in F major, D flat major and D minor.|$|E
500|$|The film had its {{official}} premiere in Alice Tully Hall at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City on January 19, 2011. Melanne Verveer, United States Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues, gave a speech, saying, [...] "Each {{and every one}} of us is called to act. I hope that tonight each <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>will</b> make their own commitment." [...] Additional screenings were held in Los Angeles and Chicago later that month. That October, Not My Life had its international premiere in London. CNN International aired the film in two parts a few days later as part of the CNN Freedom Project. The Swedish premiere was attended by Crown Princess Victoria. Bilheimer recognized that people combatting human trafficking are in need of resources, so he considered various options with respect to the intellectual property of Not My Life, ultimately deciding to release the film at charge in addition to selling licenses for unlimited private screenings. On November 1, an 83-minute version of the film was released on DVD by Worldwide Documentaries, which also began digitally distributing the film and selling the unlimited licenses. LexisNexis, the governments of Arizona and Minnesota, and the U.S. Fund for UNICEF all purchased licenses. The latter organization planned to use the film as part of an anti-human-trafficking campaign.|$|E
500|$|The {{financial}} problems within the Beatles' Apple business empire became another divisive issue at this time. From summer 1968 until {{the appointment of}} Allen Klein as business manager in March 1969, McCartney was a regular presence at Apple's central London headquarters, calling staff meetings and urging financial restraint. While noting that all the individual Beatles were demanding employers, Apple press officer Derek Taylor later described McCartney as [...] "the bossiest of the bossy"; according to Tony Bramwell, Apple Records' head of promotions, Lennon and partner Yoko Ono inflicted [...] "their own reign of terror". On 18 January, Disc magazine published what author Peter Doggett describes as [...] "a heroin-fuelled monologue" [...] by Lennon {{in which he said}} of Apple's finances: [...] "If it carries on like this, all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>will</b> be broke in the next few months." [...] While McCartney sought to appoint his in-laws, New York lawyers Lee and John Eastman, as the band's business advisors, Lennon's outburst attracted the attention of the less conservative Klein. The latter effectively became the Beatles' manager when Harrison and Ringo Starr also chose to put their faith in his tough approach to business. Refusing to acknowledge Klein as his representative, McCartney later cited this division as the first [...] "irreconcilable difference" [...] among the four Beatles, leading to the band's break-up in April 1970.|$|E

500|$|Kira Schlechter in The Patriot-News {{declares}} [...] "The Body" [...] "one of {{the finest}} episodes of any series ever", stating that the silence and novel cinematography are [...] "remarkable and the writing is brilliant". Buffy and Dawn's conversation at her school, Schlechter says, is [...] "positively wrenching". When the series ended in 2003, Amy Antangelo in the Boston Herald and Siona LaFrance of the New Orleans Times-Picayune both rated the best Buffy episodes giving [...] "The Body" [...] equal billing at the top with [...] "Hush" [...] and [...] "Once More, with Feeling", LaFrance designating the episode an [...] "instant classic". Jonathan Last in The Weekly Standard lists [...] "The Body" [...] eighth out of the ten best Buffy episodes, writing that it is [...] "the series' most difficult episode because it's real—and not real in the way ER or The Practice or Law & Order, all hyper-versions of reality, are real. At some point, most <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>will</b> experience a day like Buffy has in 'The Body' and we sense that the writers have gotten nearly every detail of that day—right down {{to the absence of}} a musical score—right." [...] In the A.V. Club, Noel Murray also finds small details compelling, such as the camera's focus on the paper towel Buffy uses to cover the vomit on the carpet. He does, however, write that some of the shots [...] "come off a little gimmicky, but the ones that work are so effective that it seems petty to complain that Whedon overdoes it at times. (Besides, different moments are likely to move different people.)" ...|$|E
500|$|The band's overall {{low profile}} in 2008 was {{initially}} {{thought to be}} due to them spending time working on their second album. However, in December 2008, Delorentos explained in their MySpace blog that a potential record deal had fallen through due to the prospective label encountering financial problems. Added to this, the collapse of Pinnacle, their distribution company, denied the band a chance to release their album in the United Kingdom. Their blog entry stated that [...] "these are strange times for everyone, and for us in the music industry {{there has been a lot}} of uncertainty. It just happened that our opportunity coincided with this extraordinary time." [...] After performing a number of shows with fellow Dubliners Director, Delorentos announced their break-up on 17 February 2009. The split came about after Yourell decided to leave the band due to his desire to [...] "do other things". A MySpace entry stated: [...] "It's with a very heavy heart that we have to let you know that Ronan has decided to leave the band. He feels its best for him to move on and do other things. The three <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>will</b> still be making music and will let you know about what happens next". However, they still planned to record their second album, believed to be titled You Can Make Sound, in March 2009 – it would contain all the songs they had written in the previous year – and play [...] "a gig or two" [...] as part of a farewell tour. The band's farewell tour includes shows in Whelan's in Dublin and Cyprus Avenue in Cork. Reaction to the split was generally one of shock – The Kinetiks were amongst the neighbouring bands they had influenced, Jacqui Carroll attributed her discovery of Irish music to an early Delorentos show, whilst blogger UnaRocks, John Walshe of State, Jonnie Craig and others had recently been championing the band's sound. On 22 April 2009, the band announced they would not split after all, citing a newfound excitement for recording as their reason. Yourell later explained that the band signing away their independent stance only to be let down by their record company had [...] "knocked us out of our stride" [...] and had led to him considering his future.|$|E
