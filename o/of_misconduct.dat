While research misconduct in publicly funded medical research has increasingly been the object of discussion, public policy debate, government and institutional action, and scientific research, the costs <b>of</b> research <b>misconduct</b> have been unexamined. The author develops a model to estimate the per case cost <b>of</b> research <b>misconduct,</b> specifically the costs of fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism, in publicly funded medical research. Using the database <b>of</b> Research <b>Misconduct</b> Findings maintained by the Office of Research Integrity, Department of Health and Human Services, the model is used to estimate costs <b>of</b> research <b>misconduct</b> in public funded medical research among faculty during the period 2000 - 2005. ...|$|R

Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte and Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr were sick, or claimed they were, and had left the army's encampments to recover their health. Masséna's force had been repelled by Hotze's army at Feldkirch, and forced to fall back, and LeCourbe's failure to push through against Bellegarde's Austrian force in the Tyrol, meant Masséna had to pull his southern wing back {{as well as his}} center and northern wing, to maintain communication with the retreating armies on his flanks. At this point, also, the Swiss revolted again, this time against the French, and Zürich became the last defensible position Masséna could take.|$|E

He finished secondary school earning the examen artium degree in Trondheim and then started studies to become a social worker at the Social School of Trondheim.

In 1982, along with fellow Red Electoral Alliance member Harald Stabell, Folkvord sued Oslo's social-office leading figures, Signe M. Stray Ryssdal and Marit Moe. They accused them <b>of</b> <b>misconduct</b> and of making a false accusation which led to an innocent man going to prison. These accusations eventually led to a police investigation into the matter. After finding no proof of their accusations, Moe sued Folkvord and Stabell for defamatatory charges made against her, but she abstained from pursuing this in court.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between generalized self-efficacy, perceptions <b>of</b> ethical <b>misconduct,</b> guilt-proneness, and counterproductive work behaviors. We first hypothesized that self-efficacy would be negatively related to counterproductive work behaviors. Secondly, we hypothesized that perceptions <b>of</b> ethical <b>misconduct</b> and levels <b>of</b> guilt-proneness would mediate the negative relationship between generalized self-efficacy and counterproductive work behaviors. We surveyed 190 undergraduate students. To test our hypotheses, we used serial mediation (self-efficacy perceptions <b>of</b> ethical <b>misconduct</b> Guilt CWBs). Results supported our first hypothesis. However, we did not find support for the mediated relationship proposed in our second hypothesis...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the frequency <b>of</b> perceived ethical <b>misconduct</b> {{in the practice}} of neuropsychology in Mexico. Method: One hundred fourteen psychologists answered a survey which assessed perceptions <b>of</b> ethical <b>misconduct</b> in four areas of professional practice in the field of neuropsychology. Results: The area of professional training contained the highest percentage of perception <b>of</b> ethical <b>misconduct,</b> followed by research and publications, clinical care, and professional relationships. Conclusion: The high frequency <b>of</b> ethical <b>misconduct</b> perceived by neuropsychology professionals in Mexico is a cause for concern. The results suggest the need to create and implement a system to make sure that professionals follow the ethics standards required by the profession, and to provide consequences for those who fail to do so. The profession of neuropsychology and training of professionals in the field must be regularized in the country, to reduce the frequency <b>of</b> future ethical <b>misconducts...</b>|$|R
5|$|In May 2005, {{opposition}} MP Gurmant Grewal accused Dosanjh and the Prime Minister's Chief of Staff, Tim Murphy, {{of attempting}} to bribe him with an ambassadorship and a senate seat for his wife, Nina Grewal, if he would cross the floor or abstain from a crucial upcoming vote. Grewal released tapes he secretly recorded of the conversation between Dosanjh, Grewal, and Murphy. Dosanjh claimed innocence and accused Grewal of altering the tapes to imply wrongdoing and the Prime Minister dismissed calls to remove Dosanjh from cabinet. Audio analysis concluded that the tapes were altered and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police did not pursue any criminal investigations. Nevertheless, fellow MP John Reynolds {{filed a complaint with}} the Law Society of British Columbia accusing Dosanjh of violating the Criminal Code and the society's Professional Conduct Handbook. The Law Society reviewed the affair and concluded that Grewal had attempted to elicit rewards for his compliance but cleared Dosanjh and Murphy <b>of</b> <b>misconduct</b> charges.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} {{starts in}} 1476 as Francisco leads Portuguese troops under Prince Juan {{to victory in}} the Battle of Toro by destroying Aragonese military camps and capturing Cardinal Mendoza and the Duke of Alba. He then launches raids on supporters of Queen Isabella. In the end, the battle is indecisive, but King Afonso receives assurances from Spain that the African coast and eastern waters are a Portuguese domain. Thirteen years later, in 1489, Francisco serves the now-King Juan, in a mission to consolidate Portuguese control of Tangiers at an island outpost in the Loukkos River led by Afonso de Albuquerque, defending the area from Barbary pirates. He is then appointed Viceroy of Portuguese India by King Manuel, and sets sail for his new post. He plunders the Swahili coast along the way there, razing Mombasa. He then establishes Portuguese India in Cannanore and Cochin and confronts the Zamorin of Calicut who intends to undermine Portuguese rule of India, and who has suborned the allegiance of Kolathiri Raja with gold; Francisco then plunders the Malabar coast. He then moves to the Gujarati coast. Afonso de Albuquerque is sent by King Manuel to relieve Francisco of his post and send him to Portugal to face accusations <b>of</b> <b>misconduct</b> in the Indies. Francisco hears of the news of his son's death {{at the hands of}} a Egyptian fleet led by Amir Husain and refuses to return until he avenges his son's death. He converts Afonso de Albuquerque to his side and then takes revenge on his enemies in the Battle of Diu in 1509, including the Egyptian Mamelukes and the Ottomans. This being done, he sets sail for Portugal, being slain by Khoikoi warriors in modern-day South Africa while gathering water.|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} three decades {{publication}} of papers in different fields of agronomic sciences have been increased drastically in Iran. However, there is growing warnings about research misconducts. To get a quantitative insight into the commitment to the research ethics, 1269 papers published during the last 3 decades in the refereed domestic journals were surveyed using human tools. The frequency of different type <b>of</b> <b>misconducts</b> were calculated and compared statistically. The results indicated that overlap in title, the target crop, experimental factors (treatments) and the measured traits was occurred with frequency of 26 % among the surveyed papers which was categorized as unauthorized adoption of ideas. Falsification and fabrication was distinguished based on the coefficient of variation (CV), probability of type I error and discrepancy between the results of ANOVA and regression analysis. This type <b>of</b> <b>misconducts</b> had frequency <b>of</b> 6 %. However, plagiarism had a significantly higher frequency and was detected in up to 12 % of the papers. The frequency of all type <b>of</b> <b>misconducts</b> was significantly higher in the papers where the corresponding authors were students compared to the papers published by scientific staffs of universities/research institutes. Overall research misconducts were distinguished in 16 % of papers and were most frequent in the 1380 decade compared to 60 ’s and 70 ’s. It seems that lack of awareness about the principles of research ethics is the main cause of the prevalence <b>of</b> the observed <b>misconducts.</b> Therefore, development <b>of</b> a national code of ethics is of high priority for the national agricultural research system in the country...|$|R
