5|$|For {{security}} reasons, GCHQ {{moved its}} own computers and technical infrastructure to the Doughnut, which caused {{the cost of}} its move to increase from £41m to £450m over two years. The moves of MI5 and the SIS to new buildings had also cost {{more than three times}} their <b>original</b> <b>estimates</b> due to issues with transferring computers. HM Treasury paid £216m toward a newly agreed budget of £308m, having initially refused to finance the original high figure. The final cost of GCHQ's move to their new headquarters was more than seven times the original estimate.|$|E

However, later in the month, news agency Yonhap reported more positive numbers from analysts, with at least 3 million units sold and 900,000 sold in South Korea.|$|E
5|$|The Senedd was {{constructed}} in two phases, the first in 2001 and the second from August 2003 until it was {{handed over to the}} National Assembly in February 2006. Between phases, the National Assembly changed contractors and the project's management structure, but retained Rogers as the scheme architect. The building was nearly six times over budget and four years and 10 months late, compared to the <b>original</b> <b>estimates</b> of the project in 1997. Total costs rose due to unforeseen security measures after the 11 September attacks, and because the National Assembly did not have an independent cost appraisal of the project until December 2000, three years after the original estimate. Phase 2 costs rose by less than 6% over budget, and that phase was six months late.|$|E

5|$|<b>Original</b> <b>estimates</b> {{predicted}} a daily ridership of 180,000 after launch, growing to 400,000 by 2036. In {{view of a}} 50% drop in airline passengers {{in the wake of}} the 1997 Asian financial crisis, forecasts were revised downwards. The final initial ridership estimate was 140,000 passengers per day. Actual initial ridership did not match these projections. In September 2007, six months after opening, THSRC carried 1.5million passengers monthly, translating to about 50,000 passengers daily. In the second year, passenger numbers almost doubled. In the third year, average daily ridership continued to grow to 88,000 passengers per day, jumping to over 120,000 passengers per day in 2012. (updated to September 2012) Seat occupancy was around 45% in the first three years, with a modest improvement achieved in 2009, and reached 53.91% in 2012.

25|$|This was {{the first}} time that the federal {{government}} helped finance a structure dedicated to the performing arts. The legislation required a portion of the costs, estimated at $10–25 million, to be raised within five years of the bill's passage. Edward Durell Stone was selected as architect for the project in June 1959. He presented preliminary designs to the President's Music Committee in October 1959, along with estimated costs of $50 million, double the <b>original</b> <b>estimates</b> of $25–30 million. By November 1959, estimated costs had escalated to $61 million. Despite this, Stone's design was well received in editorials in The Washington Post, Washington Star, and quickly approved by the United States Commission of Fine Arts, National Capital Planning Commission, and the National Park Service.|$|E
25|$|Two 1941 gelatin silver print {{portraits of}} Bate Tichenor by avant-garde artist Man Ray were {{auctioned}} by Christie's London in 1996.

Two paintings by Bate Tichenor were auctioned by Christie’s in July, 2007 at New York's Rockefeller Plaza, and both received almost 10 times the <b>original</b> <b>estimates</b> in the auction of Mexican actress María Félix's estate. Bate Tichenor's oil on canvas titled Domadora de quimeras, featuring the face of María Félix with details by painter Antoine Tzapoff, went for $20,400 USD, which was several times higher than its original low estimate of $2000 USD. Another painting by Bate Tichenor, Caja de crystal, also sold for much more than its estimated price.|$|E

25|$|The White Hart Inn is a timber-framed {{building}} {{consisting of}} three bays on a north–south orientation. The exterior is clad in stuccoed brickwork, {{the roof is}} tiled, and there are three brick chimneys. The southern section is {{the remnants of a}} timber-framed house dating from about 1600 (<b>original</b> <b>estimates</b> attributed an 18th-century date, in line with the actual opening of the inn). This had a stair turret at the rear leading into the attic, but only the topmost steps of this structure remain. The attic is still a separate space, now two rooms with one external window under the roof gable at the south end. Later, the building was extended to the rear. In about 1830, an extension was built to the north; this is of two storeys, like the earlier part, but is slightly taller and has a separate roofline. It is of brick and has no timber-framing. Similarly, no timber is now visible on the lower storey of the older section of the building.|$|E
