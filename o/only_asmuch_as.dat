40|$|Energy {{savings are}} still the best form of {{alternative}} energy. While newly-built houses generally meet at least the heat loss protection codes for wintertime, the thermal improvement of the old building stock is a nation-wide economically relevant energy conservation, {{despite the fact that}} modern user habits and demands enforce such measurements anyway. However, the old construction is to be changed <b>only</b> <b>asmuch</b> <b>as</b> no damages can occur. New heating systems, insulation between the rafters in the roof section, additional insulation of the basement ceiling, and above all, heat-loss-protected and air-tight windows often lead to surface condensation and mould formation on the walls. If the outside wall is to be insulated, but the facade to be kept in its original appearance, then only an interior insulation is possible for a thermal retrofitting. The main goal of this project is to realise the idea of a gently capillary active inside insulation without additional vapour barrier for a reference building, to control it with measurement technology over a period of at least two winter- and summertimes, and to quantify the heat- and moisture content by means of a numerical simulation. As specific object with a worth-preserving facade for the application of the above-mentioned inside insulation was chosen, together with the City Redeveloping Association Dresden, a typical 'Gruenderzeit'-apartment house, built 1895 in Dresden-Neustadt, and extensively renovated from 1995 to 97. The main emphasis of the thermal retrofitting lies in the application of a 30 mm strong Calcium-Silicate slab along the inside of the exterior wall of the street facade. This wall made of brick is covered with square sandstone blocks all over the ground level and covered with a clinker layer typical for that time. With this project, the proof of a thermally sufficient and hygrically unproblematic retrofitting of an old building structure by means of inside insulation is given, and the foundation for a corresponding renovation initiative laid. The project was promoted by the BMBF from 1996 to 1999. (orig.)

40|$|OBJECTIVE - Diabetes and {{depression}} are both {{linked to an}} increased mortality risk after myocardial infarction (MI). Population-based studies suggest that having both diabetes {{and depression}} results in an increased mortality risk, beyond that of having diabetes or depression alone. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the joint association of diabetes and depression with mortality in MI patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Data were derived from two multicenter cohort studies in the Netherlands, comprising 2, 704 patients who were hospitalized for MI. Depression, defined as a Beck Depression Inventory score ≥ 10, and diabetes were assessed during hospitalization. Mortality data were retrieved for 2, 525 patients (93 %). RESULTS - During an average follow-up of 6. 2 years, 439 patients died. Themortality rate was 14 %(226 of 1, 673) in patientswithout diabetes and depression, 23 %(49 of 210) in patients with diabetes only, 22 % (118 of 544) in patients with depression only, and 47 % (46 of 98) in patients with both diabetes and depression. After adjustment for age, sex, smoking, hypertension, left ventricular ejection fraction, prior MI, and Killip class, hazard ratios for all-cause mortality were 1. 38 (95 % CI 1. 00 - 1. 90) for patients with diabetes only, 1. 39 (1. 10 - 1. 76) for patients with depression <b>only,</b> and <b>asmuch</b> <b>as</b> 2. 90 (2. 07 - 4. 07) for patients with both diabetes and depression.

Our findings also indicate that a small but finite stress exists on the simulated nanofibers prior to elongation, attributable to surface tension. When strained uniaxially up to a tensile strain of ε = 0. 2 over the range of strain rates and temperatures considered, the nanofibers exhibit a yield stress σy between 40 and 72 MPa, which is not strongly dependent on fiber radius; this yield stress is approximately half that of the same polyethylene simulated in the amorphous bulk...|$|R

After initial loose usages of the terms (associated with promiscuous behaviour of enzymes), there is clarity that broad specificity of an enzyme in terms of catalysis of the same reaction with range of substrates should be called substrate promiscuity.

40|$|Abstract. As {{the speed}} gap between CPU and memory widens, memory {{hierarchy}} {{has become the}} performance bottleneck for most applications because of both the high latency and low bandwidth of direct memory access. With the recent introduction of latency hiding strategies on modern machines, limited memory bandwidth has become the primary performance constraint and, consequently, the e ective use of available memory bandwidth has become critical. Since memory data are transferred one cache block at a time, improving the utilization of cache blocks can directly improve memory bandwidth utilization and program performance. However, existing optimizations do not maximize cache-block utilization because they are intra-array � that is, they improve only data reuse within single arrays, {{and they do not}} group useful data of multiple arrays into the same cache block. In this paper, we present inter-array data regrouping, a global data transformation that rst splits and then selectively regroups all data arrays in a program. The new transformation is optimal {{in the sense that it}} exploits inter-array cacheblock reuse when and only when it is always pro table.

40|$|Abstract The random-vibration theory (RVT) {{approach}} to equivalent-linear site-response analysis {{is often used}} to simulate site amplification, particularly when large numbers of simulations are required for incorporation into probabilistic seismic-hazard analysis. The fact that RVT site-response analysis does not require the specification of input-time series makes it an attractive alternative to other site-response methods. However, some studies have indicated that the site amplification predicted by RVT site-response analysis systematically differs from that predicted by time-series approaches. This study confirms that RVT site-response analysis predicts site amplifi-cation at the natural site frequencies <b>asmuch</b> <b>as</b> 20 %– 50 % larger than time-series analy-sis, with the largest overprediction occurring for sites with smaller natural frequencies and sites underlain by hard rock. The overprediction is caused by an increase in duration generated by the site response, which is not taken into account in the RVT calculation. Correcting for this change in duration brings the RVT results within 20 % of the time-series results. A similar duration effect is observed for the RVT shear-strain calculation used to estimate the equivalent-linear strain-compatible soil properties. An alternative to applying a duration correction to improve the agreement between RVT and time-series analysis is the modeling of shear-wave velocity variability. It is shown that intro-ducing shear-wave velocity variability throughMonte Carlo simulation brings the RVT results consistently within 20 % of the time-series results...|$|R

As proteinuria is considered a risk marker of cardiovascular disease and of progression of kidney disease, we added amiloride 5 mg/day, a drug with proven effects in podocyte stabilization and proteinuria actions at the distal convoluted tubule. Proteinuria finally decreased to 0. 8 g/day. This report highlights the relevance of intervening on proteinuria in amultitarget approach in order to reduce it <b>asmuch</b> <b>as</b> possible. Due to this pharmacological response, we suggest that although agalsidase beta specific treatment protects the endothelium, the podocyte, and the tubule in Fabry disease and secondary haemodynamic and immunologic pathways are treated with inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system and steroids, amiloridemay act as a complementary tool in podocyte stabilization and in proteinuria effects at the distal tubule. 1...|$|R
40|$|There has {{seemingly}} {{never been}} a study conducted on Swedish euphemisms in comparison to Englisheuphemisms. This study seeks {{to contribute to the}} insights regarding euphemisms in everydaysituations. After reviewing existing literature and relevant theoretical texts on this issue, research wasundertaken to garner primary data on this topic. This was effected by distributing a self-administeredquestionnaire in Swedish to fifteen Swedish-speakers and one in English to fifteen English-speakers. Inboth samples, eight individuals were female and seven were male while age and education variedgreatly. They were posed questions featuring different terms for which they were asked to assigneuphemisms in their mother tongue. A number of findings were made which distinguished between theusage of euphemisms by speakers in terms of their respective languages, i. e. English and Swedish, butalso within these language communities in terms of gender and age differences. The study seeminglyaccorded with the general view that males are more direct and do not tend to utilize euphemisms <b>asmuch</b> <b>as</b> females. A further conclusion was that native English speakers are more comfortablediscussing alcohol, in terms of the drinking-cultures, as compared to native Swedish speakers and apossible explanation for this difference was the state alcohol monopoly in Sweden. It may also beconcluded that, while many euphemisms appeared that were particular to the language, it was possibleto identify many cases in which there are closely corresponding euphemisms in both languages...|$|R
40|$|The {{increase}} in the consumer demand and the exponential growth for wireless systems, which enables consumer to communicate in any place by means of information, has in turn {{led to the emergence}} of manyportable wireless communication products. The present research works primarily targets to integrate <b>asmuch</b> <b>as</b> signal processing applications in a single portable device. Since integration through softwareapplications compromises system speed, integration through hardware will be the better compliment. Software Defined Radio (SDR) Technology yields to achieve this small form factor system while keeping power consumption under the limit. SDR enables soft changeable system functionality, such as receiver demodulation technique. In this implementation two type modulation techniques are used, ASK and FSK. The flexibility of changing the receiver functionality in runtime is usually attained by FPGA. However, using a complete FPGA for reconfiguration of a particular functionality is not an efficient method in terms of power consumption and switching time. We proposed a SDR architecture using a recent advancement in FPGAs, called Partial Reconfiguration (PR). PR helps to change certain portion of FPGA, while the restkeeps functioning. It also reduces the total hardware usage and hence the power. The different demodulation technique and other signal processing application from an external memory unit can be loaded into FPGA PR modules while the other parts of FPGA doing a constant data processing...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We present {{experimental}} and theoretical {{results of a}} detailed study of laser-induced continuum structures (LICS) in the photoionization continuum of helium out of the metastable state 2 s^ 1 S_ 0. The continuum dressing with a 1064 nm laser, couples the same region of the continuum to the 4 s^ 1 S_ 0 state. The experimental data, presented {{for a range of}} intensities, show pronounced ionization suppression (by <b>asmuch</b> <b>as</b> 70 % with respect to the far-from-resonance value) as well as enhancement, in a Beutler-Fano resonance profile. This ionization suppression is a clear indication of population trapping mediated by coupling to a contiuum. We present experimental results demonstrating the effect of pulse delay upon the LICS, and for the behavior of LICS for both weak and strong probe pulses. Simulations based upon numerical solution of the Schrödinger equation model the experimental results. The atomic parameters (Rabi frequencies and Stark shifts) are calculated using a simple model-potential method for the computation of the needed wavefunctions. The simulations of the LICS profiles are in excellent agreement with experiment. We also present an analytic formulation of pulsed LICS. We show {{that in the case of}} a probe pulse shorter than the dressing one the LICS profile is the convolution of the power spectra of the probe pulse with the usual Fano profile of stationary LICS. We discuss some consequences of deviation from steady-state theory...|$|R
