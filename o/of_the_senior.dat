Younger Muslims argued that the Meccans were destroying their crops, and that huddling in the strongholds would destroy Muslim prestige. Muhammad eventually conceded to the wishes of the latter, and readied the Muslim force for battle.|$|E

In other verses, Koṇḍañña is shown admonishing monks who had fallen into ways contrary to Buddhist teaching. Koṇḍañña also acknowledged his own struggles against Mara, the demon who attempted to prevent the enlightenment of the Buddha. Koṇḍañña was also praised in the Udana by the Buddha, who observed his deliverance from the destructiveness of craving.|$|E

After the service, Data (Brent Spiner), who had previously become close to Yar, tells Picard that he is confused as to the purpose of the service. He says that his thoughts are for himself, because he can only think of how empty his life will be without Tasha. He asks if he has missed the point, but Picard assures him he got it.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1950s Barnes was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>senior</b> {{players in the}} side, and succeeded Roy Paul as captain when Paul retired in 1957.

At this time Barnes was the club's primary penalty taker, helping him to score 11 goals {{over the course of the}} season. In his later years at Manchester City, Barnes role as captain meant he had become a strong influence on younger players. A particularly notable example was Denis Law, who joined the club in 1960, the pair becoming lifelong friends.|$|E

Edward started with Bartholomew of Badlesmere, and Isabella was sent to Bartholomew's stronghold, Leeds Castle, to deliberately create a casus belli. Bartholomew's wife, Margaret, took the bait and her men killed several of Isabella's retinue, giving Edward an excuse to intervene. Lancaster refused to help Bartholomew, who was his personal enemy, and Edward quickly regained control of south-east England. Alarmed, Lancaster now mobilised his own army in the north of England, and Edward mustered his own forces in the south-west. The Despensers returned from exile and were pardoned by the royal council.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: <b>The</b> segment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seniors</b> is {{constantly}} growing. The segment has specific needs and expectations towards offers made to them. Nowadays, {{a challenge for}} business is to create appropriate instruments of influence directed towards this market segment. <b>The</b> needs <b>of</b> this segment must be identified to adjust offers making sure they contain innovative solutions. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this study is to}} discuss challenges a business faces in <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> segment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seniors.</b> Methodology: <b>The</b> research emerged from the deeper studies into the national and foreign literature. Frequency analysis allowed to reinforce theoretical deliberations and assess available research in <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> innovations for <b>the</b> <b>seniors.</b> Identification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attitudes and expectations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seniors</b> towards innovation required a survey. It was conducted in a group of 345 respondents over <b>the</b> age <b>of</b> 55, using <b>the</b> questionnaire developed by the authors. Lubuskie Voivodship was chosen for the research. <b>The</b> main goal <b>of</b> field research was to study attitudes and behaviours <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seniors</b> towards innovations. Before <b>the</b> commencement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> research, a pilot research was carried out, which enabled <b>the</b> verification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> measurement tool and eliminated potential irregularities. Results: The focus on <b>the</b> segment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seniors</b> will ensure producers and contractors with <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> products for <b>the</b> elderly as well as <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> new technologies. <b>The</b> research proved that contrary to stereotypical opinions, <b>the</b> researched <b>seniors</b> from Lubuskie Voivodship have a positive attitude towards innovations, especially <b>the</b> market <b>of</b> food products. Every fourth respondent claimed that he/she is knowledgeable about market novelties. Practical implications: The research constitute a significant cognitive material, and the resulting knowledge can serve as a basis for <b>the</b> formulation <b>of</b> marketing strategies by entrepreneurs working in the silver sector.
