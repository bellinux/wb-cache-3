5|$|In {{addition}} to constitutional powers, governors {{also have a}} considerable degree of statutory authority.

40|$|In this essay, Pierce and Weiss {{report the}} results of a study of {{judicial}} review <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> interpretations <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> rules. Prior studies found that, while courts at all levels uphold about 70 % <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> actions, the Supreme Court upholds 91 % <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> interpretations <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> rules. Pierce and Weiss find that lower courts do not confer this type <b>of</b> “super-deference” on <b>agency</b> interpretations <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> rules.

That is within the range of the findings of prior studies of judicial review of other types <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> actions and much lower than {{the rate at which the}} Supreme Court upholds <b>agency</b> interpretations <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> rules.

40|$|The sense <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> has {{received}} much {{attention in the}} context of individual action but not {{in the context of}} joint action.

5|$|Hospice is a {{competitive}} business. In any given service area, {{there may be}} hundreds of different non-profit and commercial providers. Hospices can be small community-based operations, part of regional and national corporations, or part of a hospital or other health system.

In 2007, {{the mean number of}} patients being treated in hospice facilities on any given day was 90.2. 79.4% of hospice providers admitted fewer than 500 patients per year.

This study evaluated the acute effects of intranasal methamphetamine on a computerized task measuring metacognition <b>of</b> <b>agency.</b> Ten non-treatment seeking methamphetamine abusers (2 F, 8 M) completed this 4 -session, within-participant, double-blind laboratory study; during each session, participants received one of four doses (0, 12, 25, or 50 mg/ 70 kg) and completed the metacognition <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> task. In this task, participants were instructed to “catch ” falling targets with a mouse and then provide metacognitive judgments about their feelings of control. Following placebo, judgments <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> were greater under optimal task conditions compared with less than optimal task conditions. Relative to placebo, the 12 -mg dose improved task performance, increased judgments <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> under the optimal condition, and decreased judgments <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> under the less than optimal condition. By contrast, the larger doses (25 and 50 mg) increased judgments <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> only under the optimal condition but disrupted performance under the less than optimal condition. These data show that a low intranasal methamphetamine dose enhanced judgments <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> and performance, while larger doses produced limited effects.

5|$|The {{railway network}} joined Burton in August 1839, {{which made it}} much more {{economical}} to distribute beer throughout the country. In 1842 William Worthington entered into partnership with Thomas Robinson, and the business traded as Worthington & Robinson. By 1861 Worthington employed 191 men and boys. Worthington dissolved the Robinson partnership in 1864, in order for his sons to acquire the business. The company became known as Worthington and Company, the co-partners being: William (1799-1871), {{with two of his}} sons, William Henry (1826-1894) and Calvert (1830-1871), who were joined two years later by his youngest son, Albert Octavius (1844-1918). After the introduction <b>of</b> <b>agencies</b> in British conurbations from the mid-1860s, the company began to rapidly expand. In 1866 the Prince of Wales awarded the company the Royal Warrant. Worthington pioneered brewing science from 1866 by employing a chemist, Horace Tabberer Brown, who led the world in separation and cultivation of pure yeast strains. From 1872 the Worthington brewery was the first in the world to systematically use a laboratory in the brewing process. The company had previously resisted employing a laboratory, for fear that the public would perceive the scientific apparatus as a means of doctoring the beer. In order to differentiate themselves from other brewers, Worthington labelled their beers with alphabetical letters: their Burton Ales were called G, F and D, their light dinner ale was labelled M. Worthington E was an India Pale Ale, a competitor to Bass Pale Ale. By 1880, Worthington's IPA was challenging Bass's sales in the home market.|$|E

Sense <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> is often {{explained}} through computational models of motor control (e. g. the comparator model). Previous studies using the comparator model have manipulated action-outcome contingency to understand its effect on the sense <b>of</b> <b>agency.</b> More recent studies have shown that cues related to outcome, priming outcome and priming action have an effect on agency attribution. However, relatively few studies have focused on the effect of recalibrating internal predictions on the sense <b>of</b> <b>agency.</b> This study aims to investigate how feedback about action can recalibrate prediction and modulates the sense <b>of</b> <b>agency.</b> While participants performed a Flanker task, we manipulated the feedback about the validity of the action performed, independent of their responses. When true feedback is given, the sense <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> would reflect congruency between the sensory outcome and the action performed. The results show an opposite effect on the sense <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> when false feedback was given.
