500|$|The {{practice}} of military deception predates Russia. The Art of War, written in 5th century BC and {{attributed to the}} ancient Chinese military strategist Sun Tsu, describes a strategy of deception: [...] "I will force the enemy to take <b>our</b> <b>strength</b> for weakness, and our weakness for strength, and thus will turn his strength into weakness". Early in Russia's history, in the Battle of Kulikovo in 1380, Prince Dmitry Donskoy defeated the armies of the Mongol Golden Horde using a surprise attack from a regiment hidden in forest. The tactics of that battle are still cited in Russian cadet schools.|$|E

[...] He learned from the prisoners that Fort Stanwix had been repaired and was [...] "garrisoned by upwards of 600 men...and the rebels are expecting us, and are acquainted with <b>our</b> <b>strength</b> and route". Daniel Claus, the Indian agent accompanying the expedition, convinced St. Leger to go to Oswego, where a body of Indians could be recruited. [...] They arrived at Oswego, New York on July 14, [...] where Joseph Brant and about 800 Indians joined the expedition. These consisted mainly of Mohawks and Senecas, but there were also warriors from the other tribes of the Iroquois League (other than the Oneidas and the Tuscaroras, who still claimed neutrality), and some Indians from the Great Lakes area.|$|E
500|$|In September 1949, Nixon hired Chotiner as {{campaign}} manager for his upcoming 1950 run for the United States Senate. Helen Gahagan Douglas defeated Manchester Boddy for the Democratic nomination in a primary that badly splintered the Democratic Party, while Nixon had little effective competition for the Republican slot. Chotiner realized that Nixon could not beat Douglas by advocating more social welfare programs, so he advised his candidate to attack Douglas {{on the issue of}} communism, seen as a Democratic vulnerability. Echoing a theme used by Boddy in the primary, Chotiner linked Representative Douglas with leftist Congressman Vito Marcantonio of the socialist American Labor Party, listing the matters in which the two had voted the same way in a leaflet printed on pink paper—the [...] "Pink Sheet"—and popularizing a label for Douglas which had been first coined by Boddy—the [...] "Pink Lady". However, the Northern California campaign chairman for Nixon, John Dinkenspiel, and his paid assistant, Harvey Hancock, declined to use the Pink Sheet in their territory. With the Korean War raging, Douglas also tried to depict Nixon as soft on communism, stating this in her first speech of the general election campaign, but that strategy was not successful, and Chotiner noted, [...] "She made the fatal mistake of attacking <b>our</b> <b>strength</b> instead of sticking to attacking our weakness." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1927, Coolidge vacationed in the Black Hills of South Dakota, where he engaged in horseback riding and fly fishing and {{attended}} rodeos. He made Custer State Park his [...] "summer White House." [...] While on vacation, Coolidge surprisingly issued a terse statement {{that he would not}} seek a second full term as president: [...] "I do not choose to run for President in 1928." [...] After allowing the reporters to take that in, Coolidge elaborated. [...] "If I take another term, I will be in the White House till 1933… Ten years in Washington is longer than any other man has had it—too long!" [...] In his memoirs, Coolidge explained his decision not to run: [...] "The Presidential office takes a heavy toll of those who occupy it and those who are dear to them. While we should not refuse to spend and be spent in the service of our country, it is hazardous to attempt what we feel is beyond <b>our</b> <b>strength</b> to accomplish." [...] After leaving office, he and Grace returned to Northampton, where he wrote his memoirs. The Republicans retained the White House in 1928 in the person of Coolidge's Secretary of Commerce, Herbert Hoover. Coolidge had been reluctant to endorse Hoover as his successor; on one occasion he remarked that [...] "for six years that man has given me unsolicited advice—all of it bad." [...] Even so, Coolidge had no desire to split the party by publicly opposing the nomination of the popular commerce secretary.|$|E

This younger-skewing content was continued with the comedy series Marvel's New Warriors ordered in April 2017, with Freeform executive Karey Burke saying, Marvel [...] "started to see <b>our</b> <b>strength</b> with young adults and together we could create a pipeline for content that was specific to our audience that felt younger than what they're doing at the other channels... It was important {{to both of us}} to find the right characters that felt like they would speak directly to Freeform's audience. The Avengers wouldn't work here but the about-to-be-Avengers works here." [...] Loeb noted that it was [...] "exciting" [...] to Marvel [...] "to be able to explore the world of the hero and how it affects someone who {{is trying to figure out}} who they are as opposed to already knows who they are and now their whole life has to take a left. That's the journey we're going on with these kinds of characters" [...] in Cloak & Dagger, New Warriors and Hulu's Runaways.
