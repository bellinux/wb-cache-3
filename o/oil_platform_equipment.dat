40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen growing {{interest}} in mobile augmented reality. The ability to retrieve information and display it as virtual content overlaid {{on top of an}} image of the real world is a natural extension to a mobile device equipped with a camera and wireless connectivity. Such applications need to address a number of technical hurdles in-cluding target recognition and camera pose estimation. Beyond these fundamental challenges, however, there is the problem of data con-nectivity and user interface presentation. How do we connect mobile clients to multiple data sources that may be changing in real time and provide the user with a flexible interface for navigating through the relevant content? We present an AR user interface framework specif-ically designed to expose disparate data sources through a single ap-plication server. Our proposed system uses an multi-tier architecture to separate back-end data retrieval from front-end graphical presen-tation and UI event handling. We describe how it might be used to build an <b>oil</b> <b>platform</b> <b>equipment</b> maintenance system, {{as an example of a}} collaborative, data-driven mobile application. 1...|$|E
40|$|About a {{fifth of}} the {{territory}} of Russia is located in the Arctic, there resides about 1. 5 million people and is located about 30 large and medium cities. Another significant factor is the concentration of the territories north of the 67 th parallel and mastered a large number of promising deposits of minerals: oil and gas among them. In connection c mining and processing of natural resources necessary to develop construction technologies in extremely low natural temperatures and permafrost. Construction in these areas {{has become one of the}} priorities of modern technological development, which provides for the establishment of special construction systems, focused on the construction of high-risk facilities in the Arctic. These objects include marine tankers, <b>oil</b> and gas <b>platforms,</b> <b>equipment</b> for the transport of oil, gas reducing installation and installation of oil refining. In each of the above objects, you must choose the right insulation, which will provide a high insulation capacity, and be fire-resistant and durable...|$|R
50|$|On September 4, the U.S. Weather Bureau advised {{residents}} {{that the}} storm was expected to strike land between Morgan City and Grand Isle around midnight, as its forward motion had increased to 15 mph. The weather service also noted that abnormally high tides were expected from the Mississippi River to Pensacola, as the center was predicted to pass east of New Orleans {{and move to the}} west of Biloxi shortly before dawn. About 1,000 people left their homes in Terrebonne Parish and took shelter in a courthouse and school buildings in Houma. As winds increased, city officials in New Orleans ordered 2,000 people to evacuate from a wartime housing project into an auditorium for shelter. Offshore, <b>oil</b> drilling <b>platforms</b> and <b>equipment</b> were destroyed by high seas near Grand Isle. The island itself was cut off from the mainland after 5 ft inundated roadways.|$|R

5|$|Arlene {{passed over}} several {{offshore}} <b>oil</b> <b>platforms</b> as it tracked northwestward across the Gulf of Mexico, producing gusty winds. The strongest surface wind gust reported {{in association with}} Arlene was clocked at 63mph (101km/h) on an <b>oil</b> <b>platform</b> south of Sabine Pass, Texas. Four other <b>oil</b> <b>platforms</b> experienced gusts or sustained winds of at least gale force.|$|R

30|$|The work {{routine in}} <b>oil</b> <b>platforms</b> {{involves}} conducting <b>equipment</b> tests which often demands inhibition of instruments and safety systems. Such processes {{are described in}} an internal document with guidelines for inhibition and control of security systems. Operators in the operational control center were expected to keep a physical copy of this document on their desks. The document states {{that it is the}} responsibility of the platform manager and operators in the local and in remote control rooms to follow the guidelines, analyze risks, register processes and suggest improvements. Furthermore, this documents states a hierarchy of responsibility in authorizing equipment inhibition according to equipment or system being controlled and the length of inhibition period. Operators in the control room played central role by gathering necessary documents to authorize inhibitions. In some moments, the communication between remote and local operators assumed a conflictual tone as offshore staff argued that the authorization process was rather time-consuming often unnecessarily delaying processes. In the same way, operators in the control center described mismatches between the “real life” of oil production and standards that they had to comply with as described in the guidelines document. On the other hand, an important dimension of integration is the physical proximity opening for the possibility of comparing how the standards are used in other platforms. The integration in the form of physical proximity among operators of different platforms provided the space for interpretation in such guidelines and in different moments, operators would discuss and compare procedures.|$|R
50|$|Aquatic organisms {{invariably}} attach {{themselves to}} the undersea portions of <b>oil</b> <b>platforms,</b> turning them into artificial reefs. In the Gulf of Mexico and offshore California, the waters around <b>oil</b> <b>platforms</b> are popular destinations for sports and commercial fishermen, because of the greater numbers of fish near the platforms. The United States and Brunei have active Rigs-to-Reefs programs, in which former <b>oil</b> <b>platforms</b> are left in the sea, either in place or towed to new locations, as permanent artificial reefs. In the US Gulf of Mexico, as of September 2012, 420 former <b>oil</b> <b>platforms,</b> about 10 percent of decommissioned platforms, have been converted to permanent reefs.|$|R

50|$|Over 40 million seabirds are {{negatively}} affected by <b>oil</b> <b>platforms.</b> Seabirds tend to aggregate around oil rigs, attracted by artificial lighting, flares, {{food and other}} visual cues. Seabirds often collide directly with <b>oil</b> <b>platforms</b> or circle around oil rigs and flares for days, eventually dying of starvation. Birds such as storm petrels, dovekies and shearwaters migrate across the Grand Banks and hydrocarbon development near the <b>oil</b> <b>platforms</b> significantly decreases the populations of these birds.|$|R
