The arguments are three: First, agreements on transitional justice are controversial; second, the trends of the recent past show disbelief regarding pronounced expectations: and third, due to the current circumnstances, the “non-recurrence” is fragile because of the probabilities of relapse, which slows the restitution to rights and duties from the State and direct actors...|$|R
