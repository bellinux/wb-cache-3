25|$|The World Cup {{tickets were}} offered in several sales phases. During the first sales period from 29 October 2009 to 31 August 2010, only {{so-called}} city series tickets were offered. Each city series includes tickets for all games {{of that particular}} host city. The prices ranged from €30 to €415. In the second sales period from 17 February to 31 August 2010, so-called 20Eleven tickets were sold to groups of at least 11 people, offered at a 20 percent discount and directed primarily at schools and clubs. Single tickets for all matches were first sold starting 15 September 2010. The prices of individual tickets range from €10 to €200. On 18 March 2011, 100 days before the opening game, the last sales phase started, with all remaining tickets being sold in {{the order in which}} <b>orders</b> <b>are</b> <b>received.</b>|$|E
500|$|As {{the company}} grew, it split its {{production}} operations, with the Harrisburg location mixing {{the ice cream}} and a new facility in Lower Swatara Township used for the actual hardening and packaging of the product. While local orders continued to be delivered in small Hershey's Ice Cream refrigerated trucks, the company shifted to transporting most of its ice cream to refrigerated tractor trailer trucks, enabling it to stretch its market beyond the state of Pennsylvania. It expanded its distribution facilities, eventually occupying 22 co-owned distribution centers. This enabled the company to ship products out more quickly after <b>orders</b> <b>are</b> <b>received</b> and resulted in less travel time for the products, ensuring freshness and quality were maintained. In the summer months, the company greatly increased its workforce and leased additional cold-storage space to help meet the seasonal orders, as the orders were prepared by hand. In 1998, operations were modernized and automated when the company purchased [...] in nearby Middletown where it constructed a modern 1.3 million cubic foot warehouse, enabling it to boost its efficiency, reducing the need to increase its summer workforce, and reducing the frequent product loss caused by hand orders and inefficient packing systems. The modernization of its warehouse also improved inventory management, order accuracy, and has helped the company continue its growth.|$|E
2500|$|The Tu-154 first flew on 4 October 1968. The first {{deliveries}} to Aeroflot were in 1970 with freight (mail) services {{beginning in}} May 1971 and passenger services in February 1972.

5000|$|... 3 November 1945: VPB-18 flew to Okinawa {{to begin}} weather flight service until <b>orders</b> <b>were</b> <b>received</b> to stand down for {{return to the}} States. Detachment <b>orders</b> <b>were</b> <b>received</b> on 14 November 1945, for return to NAS San Diego, via Kaneohe.|$|R
50|$|The T7 {{was offered}} as a {{fixed-pitch}} T6, but no <b>orders</b> <b>were</b> <b>received</b> for this configuration.|$|R
50|$|The XFD {{performed}} well, but the Navy {{had stopped}} using two-seater fighters; therefore, no <b>orders</b> <b>were</b> <b>received.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will be just}} in time," [...] one said. [...] "We have {{news that}} the sultan has just moved, with his army, to Seringapatam. Officers came here, only yesterday, to buy up cattle and grain. These are to be {{retained}} here, until <b>orders</b> <b>are</b> <b>received</b> where {{they are to be}} sent, so I should say that he is coming this way, and will be going down the passes, as Hyder did.|$|E
60|$|Do {{you think}} much of the war? I hope all will {{be done on the}} part of the two western Powers {{honestly}} and directly; and then, may the best that can, come out of the worst that must be. The poor Italians catch like men in an agony at all these floating straws. We hear that the new Austrian Commandant has received instructions to hold no intercourse with members of the English and French Legations till further <b>orders</b> <b>are</b> <b>received.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{sequence}} in which holy <b>orders</b> <b>are</b> <b>received</b> are: minor orders, deacon, priest, bishop.|$|E
50|$|No further <b>orders</b> <b>were</b> <b>received,</b> and in 2002 {{the factory}} was closed by Thrall {{successor}} Trinity Industries with 260 redundancies.|$|R

50|$|Hasbro {{has been}} the target of many fans' anger over this situation, {{despite the fact that the}} company does not {{determine}} order sizes or distribution. They promoted the movie toyline as best they could, but inventories are not produced unless <b>orders</b> <b>are</b> <b>received</b> for them. Ultimately, retailers simply did not order enough from Hasbro.|$|E
50|$|Later, an <b>order</b> <b>was</b> <b>received</b> by Colonel Robinson to {{fall back}} towards the town, which {{movement}} was executed by alternating battalions while under fire, until he reached Seminary Ridge. There a stand was made and Lieutenant Colonel Callis was severely wounded. Just before sundown <b>orders</b> <b>were</b> <b>received</b> by Colonel Robinson {{to fall back}} to Cemetery Hill, and the brigade fell back, passing through the town. The brigade had lost fully one-half its members killed, wounded and missing.|$|R
5000|$|However the broker, {{unless she}} is {{explicitly}} told what levels to buy at or what prompted {{the desire to}} buy, does not know when or why the decision was made. Her best {{guess is that the}} current price at the time the <b>order</b> <b>is</b> <b>received</b> <b>is</b> what prompted the decision and thus her decision price is the arrival price. There is no common definition of this price, but the broker normally uses the last traded price or the [...] "mid price" [...] - equal to the average of the current bid and ask prices being quoted at the time the <b>order</b> <b>was</b> <b>received.</b>|$|R
50|$|Airspeed Ltd. in Great Britain {{arranged}} {{a license to}} build D.XVIIs for the British market as the Airspeed AS.17, but no <b>orders</b> <b>were</b> <b>received.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{device was}} {{developed}} {{as part of}} the country's aim to link 25,000 colleges and 400 universities in an e-learning program.

50|$|In World War I song-and-dance man Jerry Jones (George Murphy) is {{drafted into}} the US Army, where he stages a revue called Yip Yip Yaphank. It is a rousing success, but one night during the show <b>orders</b> <b>are</b> <b>received</b> to leave {{immediately}} for France: instead of the finale, the troops march up the aisles through the audience, out the theater's main entrance and into a convoy of waiting trucks. Among the teary, last-minute goodbyes Jones kisses his newlywed bride Ethel (Rosemary DeCamp) farewell.|$|E
5000|$|The attack <b>orders</b> <b>are</b> <b>received</b> by Polar Bear 1. Moreau {{argues that}} their target will kill off all Soviet leadership, leaving nobody to [...] "turn war off".

The crew agree to turn back [...] - [...] though Tyler {{suddenly}} becomes despondent {{over the death of}} his family and has to be restrained. He later attempts to shoot the pilots for cowardice, then uses an ejection seat, blowing everyone but the two pilots out of the aircraft.|$|E
50|$|A book-to-bill ratio above {{one means}} that more <b>orders</b> <b>were</b> <b>received</b> than filled, {{indicating}} strong demand, while a ratio below one indicates weak demand.|$|R
5000|$|... 19-20 July 1945: <b>Orders</b> <b>were</b> <b>received</b> for a standdown and disestablishment. The {{squadron}} {{was formally}} disestablished at NAS Moffett Field on 20 July 1945.|$|R
60|$|It need {{hardly be}} said that these <b>orders</b> <b>were</b> <b>received</b> with a laugh and a prompt {{obedience}} {{on the part of}} the little man.|$|R
50|$|The court made a {{judgement}} {{of interference}} of {{work because of}} too many received telephone calls, but this issue might also arise when too many commercial <b>orders</b> <b>are</b> <b>received</b> by telephone. Under any democratic country’s legal principles, it cannot be logically justified that the congestion of the ordering telephone calls is legal and the congestion of the protest calls should be illegal. How defendants of this case exercised power by suggesting a boycott to citizens. In addition they ask how the people who leave messages on an Internet bulletin board can interrupt or overbear the free decisions of readers or advertisers.|$|E
5000|$|Originally {{projected}} as a [...] "$35 laptop", {{the device}} {{will be sold}} to the Government of India and distributed to university students - initially at US$50 until further <b>orders</b> <b>are</b> <b>received</b> and projected eventually to achieve the target $35 price. A commercial version of Aakash is currently marketed as UbiSlate 7+ at a price of $60. The Aakash 2, codenamed UbiSlate 7C, was released on 11 November 2012 and has a configuration that is an improvement over previous versions. The tablet will be sold to MHRD {{at a cost of}} Rs.2263 and subsidised to Rs.1130 for students.|$|E

5000|$|Dr. Ignatius Q [...] "I.Q." [...] Hi - (voiced by Richard McGonagle) The {{overweight}} scientist that revived Dodgers {{after being}} frozen for three centuries. Serious and hard-working, {{he is often}} irritated and frustrated with Dodger's incompetent side, and doubts that Dodgers truly was a 21st-century hero. In {{addition to being a}} hard-working scientist, he constantly wears gloves that stretch up his arm, ending at his elbow and leaving a gap between his fingertips and the glove's tips (which he did not wear in the 1952 short). Also, every year, he tags along with Dodgers, flying as a cadet to see how <b>orders</b> <b>are</b> <b>received</b> on Dodgers' ship, much like the Cadet. In college, he majored in Pointless Minutiae, which his mother warned him against. He also has a slight potassium deficiency.|$|E
5000|$|The December 1885 Navy List lists her as at Chatham, {{with her}} {{commissioned}} and warrant officers borne in the Pembroke as follows:In the 1880s, what normally happened with a ship was, [...] "the staff {{necessary for the}} efficient maintenance of the machinery is supplied by the Steam Reserve, and when <b>orders</b> <b>are</b> <b>received</b> to commission the ship the {{men who have been}} employed upon her are as far as possible selected to compose her engine-room staff. In the case of the Phaëton the men who had been so employed had, from various causes, been drafted away before the order was received to commission her, with the exception of three stokers who formed part of her staff. None of the accidents that subsequently occurred in the ship can be attributed to this cause." ...|$|E
