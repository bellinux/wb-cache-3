5|$|In {{the waiting}} room outside the morgue, the doctor tells Buffy that Joyce died of an {{aneurysm}} suddenly and painlessly. Left alone with Buffy, Tara tells her that her own mother {{died when she was}} 17 and she went through something similar. Dawn goes alone to the morgue to see Joyce's body. While she is there, one of the bodies, now a vampire, gets up. After noticing Dawn has not come back, Buffy goes to look for her and finds her in the morgue, being attacked by the vampire. As Buffy fights and kills the vampire, the sheet falls from Joyce's face. Looking at her mother, Dawn asks where she went, as she reaches <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> her cheek.|$|E
5|$|Kalākaua's Masonic ties as Master of Lodge Le Progres de L'Oceanie {{would give}} him a global brotherhood in his travels. He and his chosen companions boarded the {{steamship}} City of Sydney at 6:30a.m., January 20, bound for San Francisco. As the King made his way onto the ship, many in the crowd at the dock reached <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> him. Major George W. Macfarlane, his aide-de-camp, would accompany them as far as California. The King traveled as Aliʻi Kalākaua and as Prince Kalākaua, rather than in his capacity as head of state. The intent was to give the impression of a personal vacation, thereby avoiding the large costly retinue required for official business. The Royal Hawaiian Band, the Hawaiian army, and a large contingent of well-wishers bid them farewell as the City of Sydney sailed out.|$|E

Hightower, under a ghostly form, glowing blue, appears beside it and reaches <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> it. The idol zaps him with a bolt of green electricity, blasting him backwards past open {{elevator doors}} {{at the opposite end of}} the apartments, where Hightower falls down the shaft, which then fades away, replaced by a star field. The idol turns toward the guests' elevator and laughs before the doors close.|$|E
25|$|After dinner, Belle gets {{a tour of}} {{the castle}} {{courtesy}} of Cogsworth and Lumière, her curiosity leads her to enter the West Wing, a place the Beast told her was forbidden. Mesmerized by a mysterious rose floating in a bell jar, she reaches <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> it but before she can, the Beast stops her and orders her to get out accidentally shoving her in the process. Fearing for her life, Belle flees from the castle. Realizing his deadly mistake, the Beast knows he will be a monster forever if he cannot learn to love her ("If I Can't Love Her").|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} of the pictures, {{and one of the most}} widely {{recognised}} images in the history of painting, Michelangelo shows God reaching <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> Adam, who, in the words of Vasari, is [...] "a figure whose beauty, pose and contours are such that it seems to have been fashioned that very moment by the first and supreme creator rather than by the drawing and brush of a mortal man." [...] From beneath the sheltering arm of God, Eve looks out, a little apprehensively. The [...] "glory" [...] of God, represented by a dark shaded area around him, has the same anatomical geometry as a human brain.|$|E

500|$|The {{story begins}} with [...] "Time of the Preacher", where the {{character}} evokes {{his love for}} his wife, whom he suspects is unfaithful. In the following song, [...] "I Couldn't Believe It Was True", the infidelity is revealed. This leads to a short version of [...] "Time of the Preacher," [...] wherein the singer ends with the line [...] "Now the lesson is over, and the killing's begun". The reaction of the husband is depicted by Nelson in a medley of [...] "Blue Rock, Montana" [...] and [...] "Red Headed Stranger". The first song describes the double murder of the unfaithful woman and her lover by the Stranger, who states [...] "And they died {{with a smile on}} their faces." [...] This leads to the second song of the medley, which describes the grief of the Stranger. This section is followed by Nelson's cover of the 1947 Fred Rose, song [...] "Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain", where the fugitive laments the loss of his wife. In [...] "Red Headed Stranger," [...] the protagonist commits a subsequent murder—he kills a woman who merely reaches <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> one of his horses. [...] The horse means more to him than life because it had belonged to his wife. [...] But the Stranger goes free because [...] "you can't hang a man for killin' a woman who's tryin' to steal your horse." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jimmy Page is filmed {{sitting by}} a lake {{next to his}} 18th century manor at Plumpton, East Sussex, playing a hurdy-gurdy. The tune played is called [...] "Autumn Lake" [...] and the scene was filmed in October 1973. Page's fantasy role {{involved}} climbing up {{the face of a}} snow-capped mountain near Boleskine House, Loch Ness during the nights of a full moon on December 10 and 11, 1973. The act was meant to show Page on a quest of self-enlightenment, and deep understanding, by seeking out the Hermit, a character featured in many Tarot packs. The mythological Hermit is seen on the summit of the mountain; Staff of Wisdom in one hand, and in the other, the Lantern of Knowledge held out abreast over the world below. Being a Threshold Guardian, he represents an obstacle the seeker must overcome to achieve true enlightenment. At the culmination of Page's quest, he reaches <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> The Hermit, only to discover paradoxically that the Hermit is himself. The Hermit features on the artwork of the untitled fourth album. The thematic music is [...] "Dazed and Confused." ...|$|E
25|$|Card users {{sometimes}} forget <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> in or <b>touch</b> <b>out,</b> {{are unable}} <b>to</b> find the yellow readers {{or it may}} be too crowded <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>out.</b> Such card users have either received penalty fares by revenue inspectors, been charged a maximum cash fare, or been prosecuted in courts which can issue high penalties. Card users are also penalised for touching {{in and out of the}} same station within a two-minute period. The system applies two penalty fares (one for touching in, and one for <b>touching</b> <b>out)</b> <b>to</b> passengers who <b>touch</b> in, wait more than twenty minutes for a train, but are unable to travel because there are no trains, baulk at the waiting, and touch out. This is because the system assumes that, after such a long delay, the passenger has traveled to another station where they have failed <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>out</b> and failed <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> in, thus resulting in two penalty fares.|$|R

60|$|The bull {{lowered his}} trunk and the herd resumed their {{interrupted}} meditations. Korak passed within {{a foot of}} the great bull. A sinuous trunk undulated toward him, touching his brown hide in a half caress. Korak slapped the great shoulder affectionately as he went by. For years he had been upon good terms with Tantor and his people. Of all the jungle folk he loved best the mighty pachyderm--the most peaceful {{and at the same}} time the most terrible of them all. The gentle gazelle feared him not, yet Numa, lord of the jungle, gave him a wide berth. Among the younger bulls, the cows and the calves Korak wound his way. Now and then another trunk would run <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> him, and once a playful calf grasped his legs and upset him.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly the inspirer was {{transformed}} into the man of affairs who calmly proposed the organization of a strike committee, three members of which were to be chosen by each nationality. And the resolution, translated into many tongues, was adopted amidst an uproar of enthusiasm. Until that moment the revolt had been personal, local, founded on a particular grievance which {{had to do with}} wages and the material struggle for existence. Now all was changed; now they were convinced that the deprivation and suffering to which they had pledged themselves were not for selfish ends alone, but also vicarious, dedicated to the liberation of all the downtrodden of the earth. Antonelli became a saviour; they reached <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> him as he passed; they trooped into the snowy street, young men and old, and girls, and women holding children in their arms, their faces alight with something never known or felt before.|$|E

He has summed up Bhagavad Gita in four words: [...] "Flow along with life.", and to those who ask him {{how to deal with}} life's [...] "ups and downs", he answers [...] "I will take care".|$|R
60|$|These {{considerations}} {{urged me}} to direct due cautions to such tradesmen, and such as would be particular to them, especially not <b>to</b> launch <b>out</b> in adventures beyond the compass of their stocks,[3] and withal to manage those things with due wariness. But this work had not room for those things; and as that sort of amphibious tradesmen, for such they are, trading both by water and by land, are not of the kind with those particularly aimed at in these sheets, I thought {{it was better to}} leave them quite <b>out</b> than <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> but lightly upon them.|$|R

6000|$|You {{may feel}} {{disposed}} {{to say to}} all this: We grant the major premises, but why look {{to the work of}} prose fiction as the main instrument in this necessary process of, so to speak, sympathising humanity together? Cannot this be done far more effectively through biography and autobiography, for example? Isn't there the lyric; and, above all, isn't there the play? Well, so far as the stage goes, I think it is a very charming and exciting form of human activity, a display of actions and surprises of the most moving and impressive sort; but beyond the opportunity it affords for saying startling and thought-provoking things--opportunities Mr. Shaw, for example, has worked to the utmost limit--I do not see that the drama does much to enlarge our sympathies and add to our stock of motive ideas. And regarded as a medium for startling and thought-provoking things, the stage seems to me an extremely clumsy and costly affair. One might just as well go about with a pencil writing up the thought-provoking phrase, whatever it is, on walls. The drama excites our sympathies intensely, {{but it seems to me}} it is far too objective a medium to widen them appreciably, and it is that widening, that increase in the range of understanding, at which I think civilisation is aiming. The case for biography, and more particularly autobiography, as against the novel, is, I admit, at the first blush stronger. You may say: Why give us these creatures of a novelist's imagination, these phantom and fantastic thinkings and doings, when we may have the stories of real lives, really lived--the intimate record of actual men and women? To which one answers: [...] "Ah, if one could!" [...] But it is just because biography does deal with actual lives, actual facts, because it radiates <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> continuing interests and sensitive survivors, that it is so unsatisfactory, so untruthful. Its inseparable falsehood is the worst of all kinds of falsehood--the falsehood of omission. Think what an abounding, astonishing, perplexing person Gladstone must have been in life, and consider Lord Morley's [...] "Life of Gladstone," [...] cold, dignified--not a life at all, indeed, so much as embalmed remains; the fire gone, the passions gone, the bowels carefully removed. All biography has something of that post-mortem coldness and respect, and as for autobiography--a man may show his soul in a thousand half-conscious ways, but to turn upon oneself and explain oneself is given to no one. It is the natural liars and braggarts, your Cellinis and Casanovas, men with a habit of regarding themselves with a kind of objective admiration, who do best in autobiography. And, on the other hand, the novel has neither the intense self-consciousness of autobiography nor the paralysing responsibilities of the biographer. It is by comparison irresponsible and free. Because its characters are figments and phantoms, they can be made entirely transparent. Because they are fictions, and you know they are fictions, so that they cannot hold you for an instant so soon as they cease to be true, they have a power of veracity quite beyond that of actual records. Every novel carries its own justification and its own condemnation in its success or failure to convince you that the thing was so. Now history, biography, blue-book and so forth, can hardly ever get beyond the statement that the superficial fact was so.|$|E
