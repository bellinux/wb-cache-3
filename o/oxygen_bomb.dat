The present study documents new higher heating value of one Chinese rice husk and formulates a useful method for the determination of testing conditions under which the heating value of rice husks is measured...|$|E
40|$|Antibiotic mycelial dreg is a {{hazardous}} pollutant {{that is difficult}} to deal with because of its high contents of moisture and biomass pectin. Our previous work has demonstrated that the hydrothermal treatment (HTT) provides a feasible way to produce safe solid biofuel by reducing its moisture and nitrogen contents and decomposing its residual antibiotics. This study is devoted to further investigating the HTT through characterizing the HTT produced solid biofuels using <b>oxygen</b> <b>bomb</b> calorimeter, XPS, FTIR, XRF, TGA, DTA and so on. The results showed that the higher heating value (HHV) of the solid biofuel can reach about 26. 5 kI/g, which was much higher than the HHV of dried raw antibiotic mycelial dreg made by conventional drying (only 19. 3 kJ/g). Moreover, the N content was lowered from 7. 7 wt. % in the dried raw antibiotic mycelial dreg to 5. 6 wt. % in the 200 degrees C HTT produced solid biofuel, while most alkaline metals and chlorine in ash of antibiotic mycelial dreg were leached out with centrifugation after HTT. The atomic ratios of H/C and O/C in the solid biofuels both decreased with increasing the temperature of HTT, indicating the occurrence of dehydration, decarboxylation and hydrolysis of solid matters in the dreg. The HTT also greatly improved the combustion reactivity of the solid matters in the antibiotic mycelial dreg. All of these show that HTT provides indeed an effective way to convert the antibiotic mycelial dreg into high-quality solid biofuel. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. </p...|$|E
40|$|Indonesia is a {{tropical}} country and has abundant varieties of plants {{but has not}} been utilized to the fullest. One of the plants that are often encountered in the community is Cerbera manghas. Cerbera manghas is {{known as one of}} the trees that have solid roots; thus, it is widely used for adding greenery both on the roadside and the residential areas of Surabaya. Although beneficial for shade and the reduction of air pollution in urban areas, waste from the leaves of this plant become a serious issue for the cleanliness of the city. Organic solid waste that comes from the falling leaves have the potential to be used as a solid fuel alternative in the form of briquettes when processed appropriately. This study aims to investigate the potential of Cerbera manghas leaves waste to be used as raw material of biomass briquettes with tapioca as a binder, to evaluate the property of the resulted briquettes using ultimate analysis, proximate analysis, and also to find the effect of the composition of tapioca to the heating value of the biomass briquettes. Heating values of five mixtures with various tapioca compositions of 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, and 50 % were evaluated using an <b>oxygen</b> <b>bomb</b> calorimeter. The experimental results showed that the biomass briquettes made of Cerbera manghas leaves waste can be made using tapioca as a binder. The greater the percentage of the mass of tapioca in the briquettes, the lower heating value generated. Biomass briquettes made of Cerbera manghas leaves waste can be made into a source of sustainable energy with the optimal composition of 90 % waste leaves and 10 % tapioca...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1987 This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} findings of a literature review and information regarding selection, implementation and development of a chemical composition procedure for asphalt cements. The chemical composition analysis selected was the Corbett-Swarbrick procedure standarized as ASTM D 4124. The procedure is a selective adsorption / desorption (solid / liquid) chromatography which separates asphalts in four distinct generic fractions. During the implementation of the Corbett-Swarbrick method, a number of refinements were made to improve its efficiency. These are presented in a comprehensive user manual as an appendix of this dissertation. The chemical procedure selected in conjunction with other rheological measurements of asphalt was used in a comprehensive study to characterize asphalt pavement material properties. Eight highway projects located throughout the State of Oregon were included in the present research. The highway projects were chosen to represent a wide variety of environmental and traffic conditions. Asphalt fractional composition was statistically related to asphalt theological properties and asphalt temperature susceptibility. Asphalt material properties were also included in the selection of prediction models and related to pavement performance. Fractional composition was also used for the evaluation of four different asphalt extraction / recovery procedures and the evaluation of a pressure <b>oxygen</b> <b>bomb</b> device, used for asphalt laboratory aging. The major findings of the research were: Fractional compositional analysis of asphalt showed that recovered asphalt may not represent the same characteristics of the actual asphalt present in the mix. Some rheological properties of asphalt showed good correlation to asphalt composition in the higher temperature range. At lower temperature, however, relationships were more scattered. Different temperature susceptibility parameters have different relationships with chemical fractional composition, and, do not correlate with each other. Different extraction / recovery procedures yield different chemical fractional composition for the same asphalt. Pavement performance statistically relates to groups of asphalt properties and asphalt mix properties...|$|E
40|$|The {{low-temperature}} heat capacity C-p,m(0) of xylitol was precisely {{measured in the}} temperature range from 80 to 390 K {{by means of a}} small sample automated adiabatic calorimeter. A solid-liquid phase transition was found from the experimental C-p-T curve in the temperature range 360 - 375 K with the peak heat capacity at 369. 04 K. The dependence of heat capacity on the temperature was fitted to the following polynomial equations with least square method. In the temperature range of 80 - 360 K, C-p,m(0) (J K- 1 mol(- 1)) = 165. 87 + 105. 19 x + 1. 8011 (2) - 41. 445 x(3) - P 41. 851 x(4) + 65. 152 x(5) + 66. 744 x(6), x = [T(K) - 220]/ 140. In the temperature range of 370 - 390 K, C-p,m(0) (J K- 1 mol(- 1)) = 426. 19 + 5. 6366 x, x = [T(K) - 380]/ 10. The molar enthalpy and entropy of this transition were determined to be 33. 26 +/- 0. 17 kJ mol(- 1) and 90. 12 +/- 0. 45 J K- 1 mol(- 1), respectively. The standard thermodynamic functions (H-T(0) - H- 298. 15 (0)) and (S-T(0) - S- 298. 15 (0)), were derived from the heat capacity data in the temperature range of 80 to 390 K with an interval of 5 K. The standard molar enthalpy of combustion and the standard molar enthalpy of formation of the compound have been determined, Delta H-c(m) 0 (C 5 H 12 O 5, cr) = (- 2463. 2 +/- 1. 2) kJ mol(- 1) and Delta H-f(m) 0 (C 5 H 12 O 5, cr) = (- 1219. 3 +/- 0. 3) kJ mol(- 1), by means of a precision <b>oxygen</b> <b>bomb</b> combustion calorimeter at T= 298. 15 K. DSC and TG measurements were performed to study the thermal stability of the compound. The results were in agreement with those obtained from heat capacity measurements. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|M. Sc. (Chemistry) The storage {{as solid}} Ag 12 BI(s) of reactor {{produced}} 12 BI (t~ = 1. 6 x 107 a) in underground respositories can present an environmental problem {{due to the}} potential release of radioactive 12 BI into the environment over extended storage periods. One process that causes concern is the solubilization of AgI through complexation when brought into contact with underground water, particularly those with high salt content. In this work the charaqterization of the complexation equilibria in the AgI(s) /I-(aq),CI-(aq) system was studied. Solu- I tions containing high CI- and low 1 - concentrations were of special interest {{with regard to the}} possible formation of ternary complexes. The presence of AgICI 22 - was indicated experimentally but no evidence of other ternary species like AgI 2 CI 2 - or AgIsCIS- could be established. Solubilities were determined radiochemically by using specially prepared 110 mAgI. Solubility curves for AgI in different I-/CI- mixtures were adequately explained in terms of models consisting of the species AgCls 2 -, AgC 14 S-, AgIs 2 -, AgI 4 s- and AgICI 22 -. Distribution curves were calculated for different I-/CI- mixtures. As an alternative detection mode for silver-determination a flow injection system incorporating a micro-column of activated alumina was used in conjuntion with flame atomic absorption spectrometry for the pre-concentration and determination of silver in water. The procedure was successfully applied to a range of water samples, but no determination of silver in halide or perchlorate media was possible. The limit of detection based on a sample volume of 15 cms was 4. 5 ~gdm- 3 and the relative standard deviations at 50 and 5 ~gdm- 3 were 5. 4 and 19 %, respectively. In part B of this work a method for the determination of chloride in organic compounds (oils provided by the Atomic Energy Corporation) by using an Parr <b>oxygen</b> <b>bomb</b> and ion chromatography was studied. The combustion products were absorbed in H 20. The solution was injected into an ion chromatograph equipped with an anion analytical column, membrane suppressor and conductivity detector. The instrument response was calibrated using different standard solutions. These were prepared from several organic solutions, an organic salt and from sodiumchloride. Calibration curves were linear over a wide range and presented good reproducibility. It differed however according to the type of standard solution used. The limit of detection was 255 ~gdm- 3 and the relative standard deviations at 10, 1 and 0. 5 ugcm- 3 were 0. 52, 1. 64 and 3. 5 %, respectively. As an alternative decomposition method wet decomposition within a sealed system (autoclave) was used. Due to the high blank values in this method no analysis of substances could be made in the lower ugcm- 3 range...|$|E
