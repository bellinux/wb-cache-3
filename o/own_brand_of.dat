5|$|Her next movie {{appearance}} {{was in the}} exploitation film Raze, where she played a character named Jamie. Directed by Josh C.

It was released on April 21, 2013 at the Tribeca Film Festival and then received a very limited release in New York City and Los Angeles in early 2014. She was cast opposite Nicolas Cage in the action-crime feature Rage, which focused on a reformed criminal seeking his <b>own</b> <b>brand</b> <b>of</b> justice after his daughter gets kidnapped. The film premiered through selected theaters and video-on-demand in the U.S. between June and July 2014.

5|$|In Five Songs (1956–57) and Musique funèbre (1958) Lutosławski {{introduced}} his <b>own</b> <b>brand</b> <b>of</b> twelve-tone music, marking his {{departure from the}} explicit use of folk music. His twelve-tone technique allowed him to build harmony and melody from specific intervals (in Musique funèbre, augmented fourths and semitones). This system also gave him the means to write dense chords without resorting to tone clusters, and enabled him to build towards these dense chords (which often include all twelve notes of the chromatic scale) at climactic moments. Lutosławski's twelve-note techniques were thus completely different in conception from Arnold Schoenberg's tone-row system, although Musique funèbre does happen {{to be based on}} a tone row. This twelve-note intervallic technique had its genesis in earlier works such as Symphony No. 1, and Paganini Variations.|$|E
5|$|Mercenaries may aid {{the player}} in their campaigns in the New World. Mercenaries are not trained like {{standard}} units; instead {{they can be}} shipped from the Home City or hired from saloons for much coin, so that only economically powerful players can employ them. Most are powerful, but hiring them does not provide experience points, so mercenaries cannot effectively replace the player's standard army, and can negatively affect a player's economy if used excessively. Incidentally, along with hero/explorer units, Mercenaries were vulnerable to assassin units such as spies, agents and ninjas. In most cases, a selection of Native American tribes populate game maps, and support their <b>own</b> <b>brand</b> <b>of</b> military units that can be trained once an alliance has been formed. Some Native American military units use mêlée weapons, a few use indigenous ranged weapons, such as bows and arrows or atl-atls, while still others adopt ranged European gunpowder weapons. These units usually pertain to the infantry or cavalry classes, but, on maps with water, canoes are also available to the player through the dock.|$|E
