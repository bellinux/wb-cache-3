5|$|As {{with the}} {{original}} game, The Shivering Isles is an open-ended expansion. The main quest may be delayed <b>or</b> <b>completely</b> ignored as the player explores the game world, follows side quests, interacts with non-player characters, and develops a character according to their taste. Once the game is updated the player can access the extra content at any time with any character.|$|E
5|$|During {{the day the}} crossback stingaree {{is usually}} {{inactive}} {{and can be found}} partially <b>or</b> <b>completely</b> buried in sand on the sea floor. It is a carnivore and adults forage for crustaceans, polychaete worms and other small invertebrates on the seafloor. Juveniles feed on smaller crustaceans such as isopods, amphipods and shrimps.|$|E

5|$|Frigatebirds {{are large}} seabirds usually found over {{tropical}} oceans. They are large, black-and-white <b>or</b> <b>completely</b> black, with long wings and deeply forked tails. The males have coloured inflatable throat pouches. They do not swim or walk and cannot {{take off from}} a flat surface. Having the largest wingspan-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, they are essentially aerial, able to stay aloft {{for more than a}} week.|$|E
5|$|The {{surrounding}} {{area has been}} extensively landscaped to create outdoor learning areas and a wildlife garden. Energy-saving features include photovoltaic panels for electricity and {{ground source heat pump}} for heating. A green roof (a living roof that is partially <b>or</b> <b>completely</b> covered with vegetation and a growing medium), is used to absorb rainfall and provide insulation. The centre is constructed using timber-frame walls insulated with straw bales.|$|E

5|$|A {{small number}} of pillboxes had been {{constructed}} in the First World War and where possible these were integrated into the defence plans. Some pillboxes may pre-date {{the publication of the}} FW3 designs, but in any case some local commanders introduced modifications to the standard FW3 designs or introduced designs of their own. These non-standard design pillboxes may be produced in some numbers <b>or</b> <b>completely</b> ad hoc designs suited to local conditions. Other designs were produced as commercial ventures.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{regularly}} receives {{cold air}} from the south that can reach low latitudes owing {{to the influence of}} the Andes. Cold waves are usually accompanied with severe snowstorms or extremely cold conditions that can have a devastating impact on the country's economy. These snowstorms and/or extremely cold conditions can partially <b>or</b> <b>completely</b> paralyze activities in large areas of Patagonia and the center of the country. In addition, cold conditions can lead to energy shortages during the winter months due to increased demand. The low temperatures brought by these cold waves can cause frosts that can damage plants, severely affecting agricultural production and devastating the local economy.|$|E
5|$|Azotobacter can fix {{at least}} 10 μg of {{nitrogen}} per gram of glucose consumed. Nitrogen fixation requires molybdenum ions, {{but they can}} be partially <b>or</b> <b>completely</b> replaced by vanadium ions. If atmospheric nitrogen is not fixed, the source of nitrogen can alternatively be nitrates, ammonium ions, or amino acids. The optimal pH for the growth and nitrogen fixation is 7.0–7.5, but growth is sustained in the pH range from 4.8 to 8.5. Azotobacter can also grow mixotrophically, in a molecular-nitrogen-free medium containing mannose; this growth mode is hydrogen-dependent. Hydrogen is available in the soil, thus this growth mode may occur in nature.|$|E

5|$|In clitoridectomy, the {{clitoris}} may {{be removed}} {{as part of}} a radical vulvectomy to treat cancer such as vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia; however, modern treatments favor more conservative approaches, as invasive surgery can have psychosexual consequences. Clitoridectomy more often involves parts of the clitoris being partially <b>or</b> <b>completely</b> removed during FGM, which may be additionally known as female circumcision or female genital cutting (FGC). Removing the glans of the clitoris {{does not mean that the}} whole structure is lost, since the clitoris reaches deep into the genitals.|$|E
5|$|Later {{many other}} Sicilian {{towns and cities}} which had been either little damaged <b>or</b> <b>completely</b> {{untouched}} by the quake, such as Palermo, were also transformed by the Baroque style, as the fashion spread and aristocrats with a palazzo in Catania came to wish their palazzo in the capital to be as opulent as that in the second city. In Palermo the , began in 1566, {{was one of many}} in the city to be redecorated inside in the 18th century in the Baroque style, with coloured marbles.|$|E
5|$|Nurkse {{argued against}} {{the notion that}} a large {{population}} implies a large market. Though underdeveloped countries have a large population, their levels of productivity are low. This results in low levels of per capita real income. Thus, consumption expenditure is low, and savings are either very low <b>or</b> <b>completely</b> absent. On the other hand, developed countries have smaller populations than underdeveloped countries but by virtue of high levels of productivity, their per capita real incomes are higher and thus they create a large market for goods and services.|$|E

5|$|As {{a medieval}} Christian author William could hardly avoid hostility towards the kingdom's Muslim neighbours, {{but as an}} educated man who lived among Muslims in the east, he was rarely polemical <b>or</b> <b>completely</b> dismissive of Islam. He did not think Muslims were pagans, but rather that they belonged to a heretical sect of Christianity and {{followed}} the teachings of a false prophet. He often praised the Muslim leaders of his own day, even if he lamented their power over the Christian kingdom; thus Muslim rulers such as Mu'in ad-Din Unur, Nur ad-Din, Shirkuh, and even Jerusalem's ultimate conqueror Saladin are presented as honourable and pious men, characteristics that William did not bestow on many of his own Christian contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} history of the Solar System, the asteroids melted to some degree, {{allowing}} elements within them to be partially <b>or</b> <b>completely</b> differentiated by mass. Some of the progenitor bodies may even have undergone periods of explosive volcanism and formed magma oceans. However, because of the relatively small size of the bodies, the period of melting was necessarily brief (compared to the much larger planets), and had generally ended about 4.5billion years ago, in the first tens of millions of years of formation. In August 2007, a study of zircon crystals in an Antarctic meteorite believed to have originated from 4 Vesta suggested that it, and by extension the rest of the asteroid belt, had formed rather quickly, within ten million years of the Solar System's origin.|$|E
5|$|Fears over a {{possible}} French invasion resurfaced {{several times in}} the 19th century, combined with rapid changes in technology, such as the development of steamships and shell guns in the 1840s, rifled cannon and iron-clad warships in the 1850s, and torpedo boats in the 1880s. This spurred fresh investment in those Device Forts still thought to be military valuable, and encouraged the decommissioning of others. By 1900, however, developments in guns and armour had made most of the Device Forts that remained in service simply too small to be practical in modern coastal defence. Despite being brought back into use during the First and Second World Wars, by the 1950s the fortifications were finally considered redundant and decommissioned for good. Coastal erosion over the centuries had taken its toll and some sites had been extensively damaged <b>or</b> <b>completely</b> destroyed. Many were restored, however, and opened to the public as tourist attractions.|$|E

5|$|Immature fruit {{bodies are}} spherical—somewhat {{resembling}} puffballs with pointed beaks—and are partially <b>or</b> <b>completely</b> {{buried in the}} ground. As the fungus matures, the outer layer of tissue (the exoperidium) splits into four to eight pointed segments that spread outwards and downwards, lifting and exposing the spherical inner spore sac. The spore sac contains the gleba, a mass of spores and fertile mycelial tissue that when young is white and firm, but ages to become brown and powdery. Often, a layer of the exoperidium splits {{around the perimeter of}} the spore sac so that it appears to rest in a collar or saucer. Atop the spore sac is a small pointed beak, the peristome, which has a small hole from which spores may be released.|$|E
5|$|In 10–20% of endometrial cancers, mostly Grade3 (the highest histologic grade), {{mutations}} {{are found}} in a tumor suppressor gene, commonly p53 or PTEN. In 20% of endometrial hyperplasias and 50% of endometrioid cancers, PTEN suffers a loss-of-function mutation or a null mutation, making it less effective <b>or</b> <b>completely</b> ineffective. Loss of PTEN function leads to up-regulation of the PI3k/Akt/mTOR pathway, which causes cell growth. The p53 pathway can either be suppressed or highly activated in endometrial cancer. When a mutant version of p53 is overexpressed, the cancer tends to be particularly aggressive. P53 mutations and chromosome instability are associated with serous carcinomas, which tend to resemble ovarian and Fallopian carcinomas. Serous carcinomas are thought to develop from endometrial intraepithelial carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|Knights of the Nine is {{identical}} to the gameplay of Oblivion; the basic design, maneuvers, and interfaces remain unchanged. As such, it is a fantasy-based role-playing adventure game. Players begin Oblivion by defining their character; deciding on its skill set, specialization, physical features, and race. Knights of the Nine is an example of open-ended-style gameplay: the main quest may be delayed <b>or</b> <b>completely</b> ignored as the player explores the game world, follows side quests, interacts with NPCs, and develops a character according to their taste. Furthering the goal of open-ended gameplay, Knights of the Nine, unlike Bethesda's prior content packs for Oblivion, begins with no explicit prodding towards the newly introduced content; players must seek out and find the game's quest without external aid.|$|E
