5|$|Nonviolent Communication (abbreviated NVC, {{also called}} Compassionate Communication or Collaborative Communication) is a {{communication}} process developed by Marshall Rosenberg {{beginning in the}} 1960s. It focuses on three aspects of communication: self-empathy (defined as a deep and compassionate awareness of one's <b>own</b> <b>inner</b> experience), empathy (defined as {{an understanding of the}} heart in which we see the beauty in the other person), and honest self-expression (defined as expressing oneself authentically {{in a way that is}} likely to inspire compassion in others).|$|E
25|$|Kan and Li, therefore, replace Qian and Kun in {{the cosmic}} domain. Since they harbor the Yang of Qian and the Yin of Kun, respectively, as their <b>own</b> <b>inner</b> essences, they enable the Yin and Yang of the precosmic domain {{to operate in}} the cosmic domain. The main images of Qian and Kun are Heaven and Earth, which are immutably joined to one another. The main images of Kan and Li are the Moon and the Sun, which {{alternate}} in their growth and decline during the longer or shorter time cycles.|$|E
25|$|It is {{in those}} two {{functions}} that the real life of the ego is manifested, but behind them is self-consciousness permanently present, which is always both subjective and objective — consciousness of ourselves and of the non-ego. This self-consciousness is the third special form or function of thought — which is also called feeling and immediate knowledge. In it we cognize our <b>own</b> <b>inner</b> life as affected by the non-ego. As the non-ego helps or hinders, enlarges or limits, our inner life, we feel pleasure or pain. Aesthetic, moral and religious feelings are respectively produced by the reception into consciousness of large ideas — nature, mankind and the world; those feelings are {{the sense of being}} one with these vast objects. Religious feeling therefore is the highest form of thought and of life; in it we are conscious of our unity with the world and God; it is thus the sense of absolute dependence.|$|E

500|$|As {{the sacred}} texts of ancient Hindu and Buddhist {{philosophy}} became available in German translations in the 18th and 19th centuries, they influenced philosophers such as Schopenhauer {{to hold that}} in a healthy mind only deeds oppress our conscience, not wishes and thoughts; [...] "for it is only our deeds that hold us up to the mirror of our will"; the good conscience, thought Schopenhauer, we experience after every disinterested deed arises from direct recognition of our <b>own</b> <b>inner</b> being in the phenomenon of another, it affords us the verification [...] "that our true self exists not only in our own person, this particular manifestation, but in everything that lives.

500|$|Numerous {{layers of}} metaphors are present {{throughout}} The Downward Spiral, leaving it open to wide interpretation. The album relays nihilism and {{is defined by}} a prominent theme of self-abuse and self-control. It is a semi-autobiographical concept album, in which the overarching plot follows the protagonist's descent into madness in his <b>own</b> <b>inner</b> solipsistic world through a metaphorical [...] "downward spiral", dealing with religion, dehumanization, violence, disease, society, drugs, sex, and finally, suicide. Reznor described the concept as consisting of [...] "someone who sheds everything around them to a potential nothingness, but through career, religion, relationship, belief and so on." [...] Media journalists like The New York Times writer Jon Pareles noted the album's theme of angst had already been used by grunge bands like Nirvana, and that Nine Inch Nails' depiction was more generalized.|$|E

500|$|Origins {{contains}} {{a large amount}} of voice acting recorded in the US and the UK. Actors include Tim Russ, Steve Valentine, Kate Mulgrew, Simon Templeman, Mark Rolston, Tim Curry, Adam Howden, Nicola Bertram, and Claudia Black. In total, more than 140 voice actors worked on the game. A large part of these recordings became the ambient dialogue that takes place between non-player characters in the adventuring party, adding to their backstories and lending more credibility to the characters. Mark Darrah, executive producer of BioWare, described the cast of characters the largest of any of their games at that time, and hoped that using celebrities would add a layer of depth and complexity to the characters. The main protagonist is not voice-acted, as the team hoped that players would [...] "reflect their <b>own</b> <b>inner</b> voice" [...] when making decisions.|$|E
500|$|The nocturnes are {{generally}} considered to be among Sorabji's most accessible works, and they are also some of his most prestigious; they have been described by Habermann as the best of his output, and by the pianist Fredrik Ullén as [...] "perhaps... his most personal and original contribution as a composer." [...] Sorabji's descriptions of his Symphony No. 2, Jāmī, give an insight into their organisation. In a 1942 letter, Sorabji compared this composition to his Gulistān—Nocturne for Piano, and he later wrote of the symphony's [...] "self-cohesive texture relying upon its <b>own</b> <b>inner</b> consistency and cohesiveness without relation to thematic or other matters". Melodic material is treated loosely in these works, reflecting their harmonic freedom; ornamentation and textural patterns assume a preeminent position. Because of their emphasis on non-thematic processes, the nocturnes have been described as [...] "static". Some examples of them are The Garden of Irām, Anāhata Cakra and Symphonic Nocturne for Piano Alone.|$|E

While writing the song, Carey did not connect to its style or sound, therefore forfeiting {{it over to the}} soundtrack of the film of the same name. However, after being convinced to keep it, she personalized it, giving it a more pop and R melody, as well as changing some of the lyrics to more precisely fit her personality. Lyrically, the song is regarded as one of Carey's most inspirational and personal ballads, with its protagonist declaring that even though we may feel discouraged or down at times, in reality, we are [...] "heroes" [...] if we look inside ourselves and see our <b>own</b> <b>inner</b> strength; in time, it will help us [...] "find the way." ...|$|E

500|$|... 30 Seconds to Mars is {{a concept}} album {{focusing}} on human struggle and self-determination. It deals with characters who battle with social alienation, emotional isolation, and political malaise. The title itself [...] "30 Seconds to Mars" [...] indicates the accelerated human society and suggests a potential escapism from it. The album's lyrics describe the personal human experience {{through the use of}} metaphors and moments of fantasy. Jared Leto regarded it as a [...] "very personal album that sometimes uses otherworldly elements and conceptual ideas to illustrate a truthful personal situation". He cited the human struggle as the most inspiring source for the band and explained that the record features [...] "a definite desire for change, for renewal, for a new beginning and ultimately, for escape". Author Karin Lowachee commented that Leto, who wrote most of the lyrics, allows the listener to draw his or her own conclusions to the meanings of the songs. She noted that [...] "this makes the music especially personal, as whatever images you conjure from the sound and words can be interpreted by your <b>own</b> <b>inner</b> language".|$|E
500|$|In {{his other}} works he experimented {{more with less}} {{traditional}} approaches to reality, so that [...] "the most frightful, the most unusual things are told with the deadpan expression". A commonly cited example is the physical and spiritual ascending into heaven of a character while she is hanging the laundry out to dry in One Hundred Years of Solitude. The style of these works fits in the [...] "marvellous realm" [...] described by the Cuban writer Alejo Carpentier and was labeled as magical realism. Literary critic Michael Bell proposes an alternative understanding for García Márquez's style, as the category magic realism is criticized for being dichotomizing and exoticizing, [...] "what is really at stake is a psychological suppleness which is able to inhabit unsentimentally the daytime world while remaining open to the promptings of those domains which modern culture has, by its <b>own</b> <b>inner</b> logic, necessarily marginalised or repressed." [...] García Márquez and his friend Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza discuss his work in a similar way,"The way you treat reality in your books ... has been called magical realism. I have the feeling your European readers are usually aware of the magic of your stories but fail to see the reality behind it ..." [...] "This is surely because their rationalism prevents them seeing that reality isn't limited {{to the price of}} tomatoes and eggs." ...|$|E
500|$|Prior to recording, Green Day rented {{rehearsal}} {{space in}} Oakland. Armstrong invited Cavallo {{to attend the}} sessions and help guide their writing processes. Cavallo encouraged {{the idea of a}} concept album, recalling a conversation the two had a decade prior, in which Armstrong expressed his desire for their career to have a [...] "Beatles-like arc to their creativity." [...] During the group's sessions at Studio 880, the members of Green Day spent their days writing material and would stay up late, drinking and discussing music. The band set up a pirate radio station from which it would broadcast jam sessions, along with occasional prank calls. The band demoed the album sufficiently so that it would be completely written and sequenced before they went to record. Hoping to clear his head and develop new ideas for songs, Armstrong traveled to New York City alone for a few weeks, renting a small loft in the East Village of Manhattan. He spent much of this time taking long walks and participating in jam sessions in the basement of Hi-Fi, a bar in Manhattan. He began socializing with songwriters Ryan Adams and Jesse Malin. Many songs from the album were written based on his time in Manhattan, including [...] "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" [...] and [...] "Are We the Waiting". While there, he also formulated much of the album's storyline, about people [...] "going away and getting the hell out, {{while at the same time}} fighting their <b>own</b> <b>inner</b> demons." ...|$|E
