25|$|The Fourth Amendment (1791) protects {{people against}} {{unreasonable}} searches and seizures of either self or property by government officials. A search can mean {{everything from a}} frisking by a police officer or to a demand for a blood test to a search of an individual's home or car. A seizure occurs when the government takes control of an individual <b>or</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> his or her possession. Items that are seized often are used as evidence when the individual is charged with a crime. It also imposes certain limitations on police investigating a crime and prevents the use of illegally obtained evidence at trial.|$|E
25|$|Initially it was {{not clear}} what form this would take - closer collaboration, full merger <b>or</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> between. However {{proposals}} for a new union which would include all AUT and NATFHE members quickly emerged and proposals to ballot the members were endorsed at the conferences in April and May 2005. On 2 December 2005 the results of the ballot was announced. The merger was supported by 79.2% of AUT and 95.7% of NATFHE members who voted. The two unions amalgamated on 1 June 2006, and then entered a transitional year until full operational unity is achieved in June 2007. The new union is called the University and College Union (UCU).|$|E

25|$|The radio {{emission}} from radio-loud active galaxies is synchrotron emission, as inferred from its very smooth, broad-band nature and strong polarization. This {{implies that the}} radio-emitting plasma contains, at least, electrons with relativistic speeds (Lorentz factors of ~104) and magnetic fields. Since the plasma must be neutral, it must also contain either protons or positrons. There {{is no way of}} determining the particle content directly from observations of synchrotron radiation. Moreover, {{there is no way to}} determine the energy densities in particles and magnetic fields from observation: the same synchrotron emissivity may be a result of a few electrons and a strong field, or a weak field and many electrons, <b>or</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> between. It is possible to determine a minimum energy condition which is the minimum energy density that a region with a given emissivity can have, but for many years there was no particular reason to believe that the true energies were anywhere near the minimum energies.|$|E

500|$|In a {{departure}} from industry practice, Radiohead conducted no interviews and did not tour before the release of A Moon Shaped Pool. On 30 April 2016, days before the album was announced, fans who had previously made orders from Radiohead received embossed cards with lyrics from the album's lead single, [...] "Burn the Witch". On 1 May, Radiohead deleted all content from their website and social media profiles, replacing them with blank images. Donwood said the idea had been [...] "a way {{of getting rid of}} all of [...] had gone before ... It was like being some sort of evil Bond villain <b>or</b> <b>something,</b> <b>in</b> some lair, pressing buttons ... It was creatively brilliant fun."

He went into further detail on Front Row, in which he was asked if this was a shift in his beliefs: [...] "A shift in me in the sense I heard my father talk to me when I was in the garden one day. But I'm absolutely certain that what I heard was my memories of my father.

500|$|... "Don't You Wanna Stay" [...] is {{a country}} pop song with a length of four minutes and sixteen seconds. It {{incorporates}} melancholic guitar riff which is accompanied by classical elements such as violin. Mikael Wood of Billboard described the song as [...] "a dramatic, slow building power ballad {{in the style of}} Bonnie Tyler's [...] "Total Eclipse of the Heart"", a view held similar by John Hill of About.com who considered the song as a [...] "classic power ballad", writing [...] "whether you want to call the song country, pop, <b>or</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> between doesn't matter because the chorus is so catchy that it doesn't matter if you use an electric guitar or a steel guitar." [...] It is set in common time and has a steady tempo of 72 beats per minute. It is written in the key of G-sharp minor and both Aldean and Clarkson's vocals span two octaves, from A♯3 to G♯5. It follows the chord progression G♯m–E–B. Bob Peacock of Roughstock thought that the structure of the song was interesting with its brief four-line verses and [...] "don't you wanna stay's throughout the chorus. As the chorus of the song starts in, the sound of electric and slide guitars are prominent as Aldean and Clarkson sing, [...] "Don't you wanna hold each other tight / Don't you wanna fall asleep with me tonight?" ...|$|E

In spite of its brighter outlook, though, Indicud is still a Kid Cudi record." [...] Logan Smithson of PopMatters said, [...] "If you've heard a Kid Cudi album before, you probably know what you’re going to get from Indicud, and for those who have been patiently awaiting his latest release, that's great news. Indicud features some of Kid Cudi’s best songs to date, and is an overall enjoyable listen from start to finish." [...] Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound stated, [...] "It's ass-backwards to make other people look the best on your solo album. Still, that might demonstrate the path of Kid Cudi isn't about being a rapper, a singer, <b>or</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> between. The point is, this record just proves that Kid Cudi has a lot of sorting to do, and continuing down the same old path simply won’t cut it in the long-run." [...] Joe Gross of Rolling Stone said, [...] "Someday this Cleveland MC/producer/former weed enthusiast will find the lyrical and vocal charisma to match the scrumptiously dark, quasi-industrial tenor of his moody beats. But Cudi’s pitchy-dawg voice remains his own worst enemy." ...|$|E
