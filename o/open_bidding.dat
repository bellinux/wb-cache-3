25|$|The General Law of the National Superintendence of Sanitation Services (SUNASS) {{was passed}} in 1994. A tariff {{restructuring}} {{with the objective of}} achieving financial viability of the EPS was carried out in parallel. Despite the government’s expectations, no single public-private partnership in water supply and sanitation was put in place during the Fujimori government and all service providers remained public. Only in October 2005 the first water and sanitation concession contract in Peru was signed in the province of Tumbes. The 30-year concession was awarded after <b>open</b> <b>bidding</b> to a Peruvian-Argentine consortium, Latinaguas-Concyssa. The interventions under the concession were to be financed with the support of a loan and grant from the German development bank KfW.|$|E
25|$|Fall was {{appointed}} to the position of Secretary of the Interior by President Warren G. Harding in March 1921. Soon after his appointment, Harding convinced Edwin Denby, the Secretary of the Navy, that Fall's department should take over responsibility for the Naval Reserves at Elk Hills, California, Buena Vista, California, and Teapot Dome, Wyoming. This last setting became the namesake of the scandal to erupt in April 1922 when the Wall Street Journal reported that Secretary Fall had decided that two of his friends, oilmen Harry F. Sinclair (Mammoth Oil Corporation) and Edward L. Doheny (Pan-American Petroleum and Transport Company), should be given leases to drill in parts of these Naval Reserves without <b>open</b> <b>bidding.</b>|$|E
25|$|Each {{type of auction}} has its {{specific}} qualities such as pricing accuracy and time required for preparing and conducting the auction. The number of simultaneous bidders is of critical importance. <b>Open</b> <b>bidding</b> during {{an extended period of}} time with many bidders will result in a final bid that is very close to the true market value. Where there are few bidders and each bidder is allowed only one bid, time is saved, but the winning bid may not reflect the true market value with any degree of accuracy. Of special interest and importance during the actual auction is the time elapsed from the moment that the first bid is revealed to the moment that the final (winning) bid has become a binding agreement.|$|E

25|$|As noted above, a local {{government}} may only {{enter into a}} contract that is within the scope of its charter. A contract to do something beyond its power is void and unenforceable, and in fact the {{local government}} will be prohibited from performing its obligations under such a contract. The private party who performs under such a contract will have no means of recovery, even under equitable theories such as equitable estoppel, implied contract, quantum meruit, and unjust enrichment. This limitation also applies where the subject of the contract is permissible under the charter, but {{the manner in which the}} contract is made or awarded violates proscriptions set forth in the charter. For example, if the charter requires that contracts for provision of a public service be awarded to the lowest bidder in an <b>open</b> <b>bidding</b> process, and such a process is not used to award the contract, then the contract itself is void and the private party to the contract will have no recourse to enforce the local government's obligations thereunder.|$|E
2500|$|GSA moved {{ahead with}} its plans. [...] In 1955, Congress {{authorized}} a GSA proposal to construct nine new federal buildings, {{including one in}} Southwest D.C. Congress also enacted a lease-purchase statute which applied only to the District of Columbia. [...] The act required congressional approval of the building requirements and architectural design, and an <b>open</b> <b>bidding</b> process. In July 1956, the House of Representatives appropriated $40.9 million for a federal building on Independence Avenue SW between 6th and 9th Streets, and $25.2 million for three small office buildings to border the 10th Street SW esplanade. All the buildings would be financed under new lease-purchase legislation.|$|E
2500|$|De facto {{voluntary}} segregation on {{the part}} of Alabama's Greek system has been considered problematic for many years. John P. Hermann, a now-retired English professor, tried in the 1990s and 2000s to end what he referred to as [...] "taxpayer-supported segregation". Controversy erupted again in September 2013, when a story in the campus paper, The Crimson White, revealed that alumnae of Greek organizations had prevented a black student from being accepted in an all-white sorority. As a result, the Alabama Panhellenic Association allowed recruitment to continue through continuous <b>open</b> <b>bidding.</b> According to TIME, a deal that would allow black women to join white sororities was announced by the university as [...] "the first step toward ending more than a century of systematic segregation in the school's sorority system".|$|E

2500|$|Gilbert Young, {{an artist}} {{known for a}} work of art {{entitled}} He Ain't Heavy, led a protest against the decision to hire Lei by launching the website [...] "King Is Ours", which demanded that an African American artist be used for the monument. Human-rights activist and arts advocate Ann Lau and American stone-carver Clint Button joined Young and national talk-show host Joe Madison in advancing the protest when the use of Chinese granite was discovered. Lau decried the human rights record of the Chinese government and asserted that the granite would be mined by workers forced to toil in unsafe and unfair conditions, unlike that used in the National World War II Memorial, for example. Button argued that the $10million in federal money that has been authorized for the King project required it to be subject to an <b>open</b> <b>bidding</b> process.|$|E

Not only Soviet style institutes should do research but also universities and private industries. State institutions should form joint ventures with Chinese or foreign venture capital in order for S developments to reach the industry. S personal should become more occupationally mobile, pay should be linked to economic results, and age and seniority should become less important for personal decisions.
