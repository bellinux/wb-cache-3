40|$|A {{well known}} {{cryptographic}} primitive is so called random <b>access</b> <b>code.</b> Namely, Alice {{is to send}} to Bob one of two bits, so that Bob has the choice which bit he wants to learn about. However at any time Alice should not learn Bob's choice, and Bob should learn only the bit of his choice. The task is impossible to accomplish by means of either classical or quantum communication. On the other hand, a concept of correlations stronger than quantum ones, exhibited by so called Popescu- Rohrlich box, was introduced and widely studied. In particular, {{it is known that}} Popescu-Rohrlich box enables simulation of the random <b>access</b> <b>code</b> with the support of one bit of communication. Here, we propose a quantum analogue of this phenomenon. Namely, we define an analogue of a random <b>access</b> <b>code,</b> where instead of classical bits, one encodes qubits. We provide a quantum non-signaling box that if supported with two classical bits, allows to simulate a quantum version of random <b>access</b> <b>code.</b> We point out that two bits are necessary. We also show that a quantum random <b>access</b> <b>code</b> cannot be fully quantum: when Bob inputs superposition of two choices, the output will be in a mixed state rather than in a superposition of required states...|$|R

This paper considers random access process of LTE system in relay network. A problem caused {{by the introduction of}} relay network is addressed, and a solution is provided. The proposed solution includes the power control strategy for both downlink broadcast signal and uplink random access signal. Simulation results show that the addressed problem is overcome by the proposed power control algorithm while the backward compatibility is maintained. I...|$|R

40|$|International audienceRandom <b>access</b> <b>coding</b> is an {{information}} task {{that has been}} extensively studied and found many applications in quantum information. In this scenario, Alice receives an n-bit string x, and wishes to encode x into a quantum state ρ x, such that Bob, when receiving the state ρ x, can choose any bit i ∈ [n] and recover the input bit x i with high probability. Here we study a variant called parity-oblivious random <b>access</b> <b>codes,</b> where we impose the cryptographic property that Bob cannot infer any information about the parity of any subset of bits of the input, apart from the single bits x i. We provide the optimal quantum parity-oblivious random <b>access</b> <b>codes</b> and {{show that they are}} asymp-totically better than the optimal classical ones. For this, we relate such encodings to a non-local game and provide tight bounds for the success probability of the non-local game via semidefinite program-ming. We also extend the well-known quantum random <b>access</b> <b>codes</b> for encoding 2 or 3 classical bits into a single qubit. Our results provide a large non-contextuality inequality violation and resolve the main open problem in a work of Spekkens, Buzacott, Keehn, Toner, and Pryde (2009) ...|$|R
