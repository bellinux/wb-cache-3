5|$|While lions do {{not usually}} hunt people, some (usually males) seem {{to seek out}} human prey; one well-publicised case {{includes}} the Tsavo maneaters, where 28 officially recorded railway workers building the Kenya-Uganda Railway were taken by lions over nine months during {{the construction of a}} bridge over the Tsavo River in Kenya in 1898. The hunter who killed the lions wrote a book detailing the animals' predatory behaviour. The lions were larger than normal, lacked manes, and <b>one</b> <b>seemed</b> to suffer from tooth decay. The infirmity theory, including tooth decay, is not favoured by all researchers; an analysis of teeth and jaws of man-eating lions in museum collections suggests that while tooth decay may explain some incidents, prey depletion in human-dominated areas is a more likely cause of lion predation on humans.|$|E

He batted low in the order, and made his highest score of 66 against Bengal in his second match. Bihar needed 264 to take the first-innings lead, which in a drawn match, as this <b>one</b> <b>seemed</b> likely to be, effectively counted as a victory. Bose went in at 149 for seven, and was last man out, caught on the boundary going for the six that would have taken Bihar into the lead.|$|E
25|$|At school, {{as well as}} in church, Francisco's claimed paranormal power {{constantly}} {{would put}} him into trouble. Once, while in his fourth year of primary school, he claimed to have seen a man who had dictated all his school essays, but no <b>one</b> <b>seemed</b> to have given him any credits; and not even the teacher seemed to have cared about it. One of his memorial school compositions on the centenary of the independence of Brazil won an honorable mention in a state contest. In 1922 he faced skepticism from colleagues and friends, who accused him of plagiarism, such accusation lasted all his life. Challenged to prove his gifts, Francisco was submitted to the challenge of improvising an essay (with the help of a spirit) about sand grain, the topic was chosen at that very moment, in which, he succeeded.|$|E

500|$|The {{new plan}} drew {{extensive}} criticism. [...] Southside legislators feared that only all-white schools would close. Stanley asserted that his plan would permit him to close black schools {{as well as}} white ones if an all-white school was forced to integrate (although no <b>one</b> <b>seemed</b> able to find this provision in his newly introduced bills). Attorney General Almond voiced his opinion that the new plan would not stop integrationist lawsuits, and that making the governor {{an agent of the}} legislature was clearly unconstitutional. When Speaker Moore later in the day proposed a pupil assignment plan that did not permit local integration, Stanley abandoned his new plan and supported Moore's proposal.|$|E
500|$|Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} special a grade of C, criticizing it {{as a mere}} promotional vehicle for Gaga with the Muppets a last-minute addition. The {{production}} was unable to balance Gaga's album promotion with a Muppets holiday special: [...] "Nothing in Lady Gaga & The Muppets' Holiday Spectacular destroys {{the sanctity of the}} Muppets ... However, the potential for a Muppets holiday special was never given room to materialize amidst a Lady Gaga concert special designed to sell her new album. The choice to combine the two may have reached out to a broader audience, but the incongruence of the special's various parts... was bound to frustrate a sizable portion of that audience." [...] Todd Martens of the Los Angeles Times agreed, criticizing the special's commercial nature; he also said its songs were [...] "less fit for a Muppet-like music special, and no <b>one</b> <b>seemed</b> willing to stray too far from the show's message of selling a product. Rather than aim for holiday timelessness, this was self-promotion, with the Muppets often coming to Gaga's world than the other way around." [...] Billboards Chris Willman also gave it a negative review, citing the show's palpably-low budget and its dialogue, guest appearances, Gaga's lip-syncing and production: [...] "There was a familiar 'why is this happening?' question hovering over the star-crossed proceedings, albeit without the benefit of any guest stars as seriously wacky as that ones to show up and redeem the incongruousness." ...|$|E

2500|$|During 1820, the New Israelite Temple {{established}} an affiliated prayer {{group in the}} Leipzig Trade Fair. Services where held annually, and knowledge of them spread across Europe via the Jewish merchants. Another short-lived association which attempted to emulate the Berlin-Hamburg model was active in Karlsruhe between 1820 and 1823. But although many synagogues gradually began to adopt aesthetic reforms, those were limited and strictly in the external sphere. The prayerbook, especially the ideology behind it, and even the organ on Saturday remained confined to Congregation New House. [...] "Here alone during the 1820's and 1830's {{there had been a}} clearly nonorthodox Jewish religious service...

2500|$|The {{founding}} of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation by Labor Prime Minister Ben Chifley in 1949 was considered highly controversial within Chifley's own party. Until then, the left-leaning Australian Labor Party had been hostile to domestic intelligence agencies on civil-liberties grounds and a Labor government founding <b>one</b> <b>seemed</b> a surprising about-face. But the presentation of Venona material to Chifley, revealing evidence of Soviet agents operating in Australia, brought this about. As well as Australian diplomat suspects abroad, Venona had revealed Walter Seddon Clayton (cryptonym [...] "KLOD"), a leading official within the Communist Party of Australia (CPA), as the chief organiser of Soviet intelligence gathering in Australia. Investigation revealed that Clayton formed an underground network within the CPA so that the party could continue to operate if it were banned.|$|E

2500|$|In 1930, Mencken married Sara Haardt, a German American {{professor}} of English at Goucher College in Baltimore and an author eighteen years his junior. Haardt had led efforts in Alabama {{to ratify the}} 19th Amendment. The two met in 1923, after Mencken delivered a lecture at Goucher; a seven-year courtship ensued. The marriage made national headlines, and many were surprised that Mencken, who once called marriage [...] "the end of hope" [...] and who was well known for mocking relations between the sexes, {{had gone to the}} altar. [...] "The Holy Spirit informed and inspired me," [...] Mencken said. [...] "Like all other infidels, I am superstitious and always follow hunches: this <b>one</b> <b>seemed</b> to be a superb one." [...] Even more startling, he was marrying an Alabama native, despite his having written scathing essays about the American South. Haardt was in poor health from tuberculosis throughout their marriage and died in 1935 of meningitis, leaving Mencken grief-stricken. He had always championed her writing and, after her death, had a collection of her short stories published under the title Southern Album.|$|E
2500|$|It is, however, {{said that}} Plato once {{disclosed}} this {{knowledge to the}} public in his lecture On the Good (Περὶ τἀγαθοῦ), in which the Good (τὸ ἀγαθόν) is identified with the One (the Unity, τὸ ἕν), the fundamental ontological principle. The content of this lecture has been transmitted by several witnesses. Aristoxenus describes the event in the following words: [...] "Each came expecting to learn something about the things that are generally considered good for men, such as wealth, good health, physical strength, and altogether a kind of wonderful happiness. But when the mathematical demonstrations came, including numbers, geometrical figures and astronomy, and finally the statement Good is <b>One</b> <b>seemed</b> to them, I imagine, utterly unexpected and strange; hence some belittled the matter, while others rejected it." [...] Simplicius quotes Alexander of Aphrodisias, who states that [...] "according to Plato, the first principles of everything, including the Forms themselves are One and Indefinite Duality (ἡ ἀόριστος δυάς), which he called Large and Small (τὸ μέγα καὶ τὸ μικρόν)", and Simplicius reports as well that [...] "one might also learn this from Speusippus and Xenocrates and the others who were present at Plato's lecture on the Good".|$|E

I went straight up there to look and everything I saw was commercial work like pictures of cigarette packs or perfume bottles but the colour saturation {{and the quality of}} the ink was overwhelming. I couldn't wait to see what a plain Eggleston picture would look like with the same process. Every photograph I subsequently printed with the process seemed fantastic and each <b>one</b> <b>seemed</b> better than the previous one." [...] The dye-transfer process resulted in some of Eggleston's most striking and famous work, such as his 1973 photograph entitled The Red Ceiling, of which Eggleston said, [...] "The Red Ceiling is so powerful, that in fact I've never seen it reproduced on the page to my satisfaction. When you look at the dye it is like red blood that's wet on the wall.... A little red is usually enough, but to work with an entire red surface was a challenge." ...|$|E

It became a staple part in the {{repertory}} of the theatre, reaching its hundredth performance there on 25January 1913. In 1908, Maggie Teyte took {{over the role of}} Mélisande from Mary Garden. She described Debussy's reaction on learning her nationality: [...] "Une autre anglaiseMon Dieu" [...] ("Another Englishwomanmy God"). Teyte also wrote about the composer's perfectionist character and his relations with the cast:As a teacher he was pedanticthat's the only word.

2500|$|Ryun {{participated in}} the 1964, 1968, and 1972 Summer Olympics. At age 17 years, 137 days in 1964, he remains the {{youngest}} American male track athlete to ever qualify for the Olympics. In 1968, he won the silver medal in the 1,500 meters in Mexico City, losing to Kip Keino from Kenya, whose remarkable race remained the Olympic 1,500-meter record for 16 years. Before the race, Ryun had thought that a time of 3:39 would {{be good enough to}} win in the high altitude of Mexico City. He ended up running faster than that with a 3:37.8, but Keino's 3:34.9 was too tough to beat at that altitude. Keino moved into the first position with two laps to go (800 meters) at world record pace. Ryun continued to move up during the last two laps from eighth to second but was never closer than about 30 yards from Keino. Years later, in 1981, he told Tex Maule in an interview for The Runner magazine, [...] "We had thought that 3:39 would win and I ran under that. I considered it like winning a gold medal; I had done my very best and I still believe I would have won at sea level." [...] Ryun was attacked by some writers who believed he had let his nation down. [...] "Some even said I had let down the whole world. I didn't get any credit for running my best and no <b>one</b> <b>seemed</b> to realize that Keino had performed brilliantly." [...] In the 1972 Munich, Germany, Games, he was tripped and fell down during a 1,500-meter qualifying heat. Although the International Olympic Committee (IOC) acknowledged that a foul had occurred, U.S. appeals to have Ryun reinstated in the competition were denied by the IOC.|$|E
2500|$|Orbison {{continued}} recording albums in the 1970s, {{but none}} of them sold {{more than a handful of}} copies, and by 1976, he had gone an entire decade without a charting album. Aside from a few minor hits in Australia, he also failed to produce any charting singles after the '60s. His fortunes sank so low that he began to doubt his own talents and several of his '70s albums were not released internationally due to low US sales. He left MGM Records in 1973 and signed a one-album deal with Mercury Records. Author Peter Lehman would later observe that his absence was a part of the mystery of his persona: [...] "Since it was never clear where he had come from, no <b>one</b> <b>seemed</b> to pay much mind to where he had gone; he was just gone." [...] His influence was apparent, however, as several artists released covers of his songs, which proved popular. Orbison's version of [...] "Love Hurts", a song composed by Felice and Boudleaux Bryant and first recorded by the Everly Brothers, was remade by Gram Parsons and Emmylou Harris, again by hard rock band Nazareth, and by blues adept Jim Capaldi. Sonny James sent [...] "Only the Lonely" [...] to No. 1 on the country music charts. Bruce Springsteen ended his concerts with Orbison songs, and Glen Campbell had a minor hit with a remake of [...] "Dream Baby". A compilation of Orbison's greatest hits went to No. 1 in the UK in January 1976. The same year, he began to open concerts for the Eagles, who started as Linda Ronstadt's backup band. Ronstadt herself covered [...] "Blue Bayou" [...] in 1977, her version reaching No. 3 on the Billboard charts and remaining in the charts for 24 weeks. Orbison credited this cover in particular for reviving his memory in the popular mind, if not his career. He signed again with Monument in 1976 and recorded [...] "Regeneration" [...] with Fred Foster, but it proved no more successful than before.|$|E
