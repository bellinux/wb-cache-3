50|$|Reflux {{refers to}} {{the portion of the}} {{condensed}} <b>overhead</b> <b>product</b> that is returned to the tower. The reflux flowing downwards provides the cooling required for condensing the vapours flowing upwards. The reflux ratio, which is the ratio of the (internal) reflux to the <b>overhead</b> <b>product,</b> is conversely related to the theoretical number of stages required for efficient separation of the distillation products.Fractional distillation towers or columns are designed to achieve the required separation efficiently. The design of fractionation columns is normally made in two steps; a process design, followed by a mechanical design. The purpose of the process design is to calculate the number of required theoretical stages and stream flows including the reflux ratio, heat reflux and other heat duties. The purpose of the mechanical design, on the other hand, is to select the tower internals, column diameter and height. In most cases, the mechanical design of fractionation towers is not straightforward. For the efficient selection of tower internals and the accurate calculation of column height and diameter, many factors must be taken into account. Some of the factors involved in design calculations include feed load size and properties and the type of distillation column used. The two major types of distillation columns used are tray and packing columns. Packing columns are normally used for smaller towers and loads that are corrosive or temperature sensitive or for vacuum service where pressure drop is important. Tray columns, on the other hand, are used for larger columns with high liquid loads. They first appeared on the scene in the 1820s. In most oil refinery operations, tray columns are mainly used for the separation of petroleum fractions at different stages of oil refining.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Process Engineering)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. Developments in {{the field}} of liquid {{detergents}} and cosmetics have increased the demand for surfactants, processing aids and emollients. Alcohols are often used in liquid products where they serve as solvents for the detergent ingredients, adjust the viscosity and prevent product separation. Industrial scale oxygenation of the alkane to the alcohol is often incomplete, resulting in a significant amount of residual alkane. Application of these alcohols often requires a low residual alkane content and a post-production separation process is thus required. Traditional separation methods such as distillation and crystallisation are not technically viable as crossover melting and boiling points prevent the successful implementation of such processes and it is envisaged to use supercritical extraction to separate a mixture of n-alkanes and 1 - alcohols. The project scope revolves around a product stream consisting of detergent range alcohols and corresponding n-alkanes that need to be separated. To model such a system, a typical detergent range alkane – alcohol feed with an average of 13 carbon atoms was selected, although a large number of the molecules have between 12 and 14 carbon atoms each. Generally the presence of the hydroxyl group as well as {{an increase in the number}} of carbon atoms decreases the solubility in supercritical solvents [17]-[19]. The most difficult separation will therefore be that of the alcohol with the least number of carbon atoms, that is 1 -dodecanol (alcohol with 12 carbon atoms, CH 3 -(CH 2) 9 -CH 2 -OH) and the alkane with the most number of carbon atoms, that is n-tetradecane (alkane with 14 carbon atoms, CH 3 -(CH 2) 12 -CH 3). To model the system, it is assumed that the hydrocarbon backbone is linear and the alcohol is primary. Therefore 1 -dodecanol and n-tetradecane are used. If it is possible to separate 1 -dodecanol and ntetradecane with the use of supercritical fluids, it should be possible to separate an industrial mixture. The deliverables of this study are: a comparison of the high pressure solubility of n-tetradecane and 1 -dodecanol with a selection of possible solvents; a selection of potential solvents to be tested on a pilot plant to confirm practical separation. From the literature and measured phase equilibria, all three solvents (carbon dioxide, ethane and propane) have the ability to distinguish (based on a difference in the pressure required for solubility) between 1 -dodecanol and n-tetradecane. Both carbon dioxide and ethane have favourable temperature considerations. Propane has superior solubility of n-tetradecane and 1 - dodecanol. Carbon dioxide demonstrates the highest selectivity. Pilot plant experiments have shown that both carbon dioxide and ethane have the ability to separate a 50 - 50 % (mass percentage) mixture of 1 -dodecanol and n-tetradecane. Both solvents perform at their best at low temperatures. Carbon dioxide shows the best results at low temperature and conditions of reflux. The highlight of pilot plant experiments with supercritical carbon dioxide is achieving a selectivity of 16. 4 with the mass percentage of n-tetradecane at 5 % and 82 % for the bottoms and <b>overheads</b> <b>product</b> respectively. Very good separation is achieved using supercritical ethane as solvent even without reflux. Attention is drawn to pilot plant experiments where the selectivity is as high as 82 with the mass percentage of n-tetradecane in the bottoms and <b>overheads</b> <b>product</b> at 1 % and 82 % respectively. It is recommended to measure ternary phase equilibria for the system n-tetradecane, 1 -dodecanol and carbon dioxide/ethane to establish the interaction between n-tetradecane and 1 -dodecanol. The measured binary phase equilibrium data need to be expanded to include the vapour mass fraction composition in the isothermal solubility data...|$|R

40|$|The present work {{describes}} {{the development and}} implementation of fuzzy control algorithms in order to control on-line the <b>overhead</b> <b>product</b> composition of a batch distillation column. Firstly, the influence of design parameters was evaluated through computational simulations and then the algorithms were experimentally tested by monitoring a pilot column. Binary mixtures of n-hexane/n-heptane were distilled. Temperature measurements and vapor-liquid equilibrium data are the basis for the inference of overhead and bottom compositions. Two different operational strategies were used for the experimental runs: constant <b>overhead</b> <b>product</b> composition and previously determined set-point trajectory. Using the first strategy, the performance of the fuzzy controllers is compared to the performance of conventional feedback digital controllers. Experimental results show that fuzzy control presents a better performance than the conventional digital feedback control and also that fuzzy controllers were able to deal successfully with variable set-point strategy, albeit using constant design parameter values. Under conventional control, the average reflux rate implemented was higher than the average reflux rate implemented with fuzzy algorithms. Consequently, the process becomes less time- and energy-consuming under fuzzy control. Since fuzzy methodology is a promising new way of looking at process control problems and their solutions, the results of this work could provide control system designers with a better evaluation of the potential worth of fuzzy control...|$|E
