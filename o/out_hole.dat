5000|$|Each {{team member}} {{manipulated}} one button, {{each of which}} controlled two flippers, and {{tried to keep the}} ball in play {{for as long as possible}} within a 60-second time limit. The team accumulated points by hitting bumpers, noisemakers, and lights. Hitting any of the seven large numbered bumpers won the contestant a prize, with bumpers two and three together earning a larger prize, such as a car or trip. Play ended if the ball fell into one of the two [...] "out holes" [...] (one located below the main flippers, the other in the middle of the playing field). The flippers were disabled when 60 seconds expired, with the ball (still in play) usually entering an <b>out</b> <b>hole</b> within a few seconds.|$|E

5000|$|On October 27, 2008, {{during the}} afternoon, several militants transported Duhulow {{to a public}} stadium in Kismayo {{containing}} around 1,000 people. She reportedly struggled with the insurgents {{and at one point}} screamed, [...] "What do you want from me... I'm not going, I'm not going. Don't kill me." [...] Four militants subsequently forced Duhulow into a dug <b>out</b> <b>hole,</b> burying her up to the neck. Around 50 militants participated in the ensuing execution, throwing rocks at her head. According to witnesses, nurses were then instructed to verify whether Duhulow was still alive. After ten minutes, she was dug out of the hole and two nurses confirmed that she was still alive, after which point Duhulow was put back in the hole and the stoning resumed. Although many witnesses to the event were too afraid of the armed militants to intervene, several bystanders attempted to save her. The insurgents responded by opening fire on them, in the process killing an eight-year-old boy. An Al-Shabaab spokesman later apologized for the child's death, and pledged that the shooter would be punished.|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} a Chern-Simons term for a gauge field {{describing}} a fluctuation of spins is induced by integrating <b>out</b> <b>hole</b> fields {{in the presence of}} spin-orbit coupling which originates from a buckling of the CuO$_ 2 $ plane.

40|$|We have {{measured}} the thermopower (S) of hole-doped LaMnO 3 systems {{in order to}} see its dependence on the Mn 4 + content as well as to investigate other crucial factors that determine S. We have carried <b>out</b> <b>hole</b> doping (creation of Mn 4 + by two distinct means, namely, by the substitution of La by divalent cations such as Ca and Sr and by self-doping without aliovalent substitution). The thermopower is sensitive not only to the hole concentration but also to the process employed for hole doping, which we explain as arising from the differences {{in the nature of the}} hole-doped states. We also point out a general trend in the dependence of S on hole concentration at high temperatures (T> T-c), similar to that found in the normal-state thermopower of the cuprates...|$|E
40|$|International audienceInternal erosion by piping {{is one of}} {{the main}} causes {{responsible}} of accidents and failures of earth structures such as embankment dams and dykes. This phenomenon occurs when concentrated leak develop in pre-existing defects in the earth fill such cracks and micro fissures, discontinuities, hydraulic fracture, channels, roots and burrows. It involves the removal of soil particles from the subsurface of these defaults to an exit point, leading to the formation and the evolution of a continuous “pipe” between the upstream and the downstream side. A new experimental device has been developed to carry <b>out</b> <b>hole</b> erosion tests in laboratory in order to better understand the mechanism of internal erosion process of soil. A series of hole erosion tests were carried out under constant flow rate in order to quantify the critical shear stress (Tau_c) and the coefficient of piping erosion (ker) of soils. Parametric studies were conducted on Kaolinite and Hostun sand/Kaolinite mixture. The key parameters investigated in this study were effects of moisture content, compaction energy and percentage of fines. The experimental results show that these parameters play a key role on the erosion characteristics (Tau_c and ker). A numerical piping model has been developed from equations of diphasic flow with diffusion and the equation of jump with erosion to interpret the hole erosion tests...|$|E
