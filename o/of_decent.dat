25|$|Invited (on Ocampo's initiative) by the Amigos del Arte {{society of}} Buenos Aires, Fondane left for Argentina and Uruguay in summer 1929. The {{object of his}} visit was {{promoting}} French cinema {{with a set of}} lectures in Buenos Aires, Montevideo and other cities (as he later stated in a Rampa interview with Sarina Cassvan-Pas, he introduced South Americans to the work of Germaine Dulac, Luis Buñuel and Henri Gad). In this context, Fondane met essayist Eduardo Mallea, who invited him to contribute in La Nacións literary supplement. His other activities there included conferencing on Shestov at the University of Buenos Aires and publishing articles on several subjects (from Shestov's philosophy to the poems of Tzara), but the fees received in return were, in his own account, too small to cover the cost <b>of</b> <b>decent</b> living.|$|E
25|$|De Angelis {{was then}} {{promoted}} back to outright number {{one for the}} 1983 season. This was demonstrated {{by the fact that}} he had exclusive use of the quick but unreliable Renault turbo-charged 93T for the whole season, and Mansell did not get to drive a turbocharged car until the ninth round, the British Grand Prix at Silverstone, a race where he climbed from 16th to second and eventually finished fourth in a brand-new, hastily designed 94T. Due to their tumultuous relationship and a lack <b>of</b> <b>decent</b> results, Warr was not keen on honouring the last year of the contract that Mansell had signed with Chapman. However, with encouragement from Lotus's sponsors, John Player Special (who allegedly preferred a British driver), and with the only other top British driver (Derek Warwick) already confirmed to be joining the factory Renault team, it was announced Mansell would be staying with the team.|$|E

25|$|The {{investigation}} report {{stated that the}} weather conditions were a cause of the accident. During the approach to the runway the aircraft was operated slightly above the stall speed and {{a major change in}} wind speed could cause a stall. The aircraft experienced windshear. The altitude, the reaction time of the pilot, and the responsiveness of the aircraft combined to prevent the arrest <b>of</b> <b>decent</b> in time to avoid the accident. The crew did not adhere to any published approach procedure and they possibly misinterpreted the altimeter and airspeed indicator. During the descent, the pilot in command did not check his approach chart and did not continually consult the first officer on the altitude and course. There was inadequate communication between crew, deficient Crew Resource Management, and no approach briefings were made for either of the two approaches. The aircraft was configured for landing with flaps fully down at a very long distance from the runway without having it in sight. The aircraft will not respond well to windshear in such a configuration. Both approaches require a circling procedure.|$|E
25|$|During the American Civil War, Abraham Lincoln {{visited the}} Silver Spring mansion {{multiple}} times. During {{some of the}} visits he relaxed by playing town ball with Francis P. Blair's grandchildren. In 1864, Confederate Army General Jubal Early occupied Silver Spring prior to the Battle of Fort Stevens. After the engagement, fleeing Confederate soldiers razed Montgomery Blair's Falkland residence. By {{the end of the}} 19th century, the region began to develop into a town <b>of</b> <b>decent</b> size and importance. The Baltimore & Ohio Railroad's Metropolitan Branch opened on April 30, 1873, and ran from Washington, D.C. to Point of Rocks, Maryland, through Silver Spring. The first suburban development appeared in 1887 when Selina Wilson divided part of her farm on current-day Colesville Road (U.S. Route 29) and Brookeville Road into five- and ten-acre (20,000- and 40,000 m²) plots. In 1893, Francis Preston Blair Lee and his wife, Anne Brooke Lee, gave birth to E. Brooke Lee, who is known as the father of modern Silver Spring for his visionary attitude toward developing the region.|$|E
25|$|Denton has had {{a career}} {{hampered}} by injuries. When fit he can be destructive, as shown by when he dismissed Stuart Law, Allan Border and Jimmy Maher {{in the space of}} six deliveries on debut in the 1994-95 summer. He took a couple of years off before returning in 1998-99 for Tasmania and earning Australia A selection. Stress fractures would set him back both in 1999-2000 and 2000-01. He recovered and reappeared in 2001-02 and after a couple <b>of</b> <b>decent</b> seasons he was back to his best in 2003-04, taking 30 wickets at 33.13. He moved to Victoria the following summer but did not get much game time due to hip and foot injuries. His only appearance for the Bushrangers was an ING Cup game. In 2005-06 he made the headlines by breaking one of Justin Langer's ribs which cost the opener a Test place. It would be another painful season for Denton as he suffered from appendicitis late in the summer which meant that he could not line up in the Pura Cup final. He still finished Victoria's leading wicket taker with 33 at 28.15 from his eight matches.|$|E

25|$|After Richard Newton's {{death in}} 1753, the principalship of the College fell to a {{succession}} of men mostly lacking the desire or energy to continue their predecessor's plan. One exception to this succession was David Durell, who built up the reputation and academic success of the College. Under Durell, the future statesman Charles James Fox matriculated in 1764 (Hertford, unusually for Oxford, was a Whig College). However, the scheme of four tutors in their respective angles was reduced to two, and cheaper junior fellows took {{over some of the}} burden of tutoring. It was at Hertford that the tutor Benjamin Blayney prepared his 1769 Standard Edition of the Authorized King James Version of the Bible. Apart from Durell's principalship, the College went into decline due to the mismanagement of uninterested principals and the lack <b>of</b> <b>decent</b> endowments. In May 1805, Bernard Hodgson, last principal of Hertford College died, and no suitable successor could be found and agreed upon. By 1810, matriculation had ceased, and the last students were awarded their degrees. The last tutor and vice-principal, Richard Hewitt, continued to live in his rooms without students until May 1816, when a commission declared Hertford College dissolved.|$|E
25|$|Kvyat was {{the fastest}} driver not to advance {{into the final}} {{qualifying}} session; his fastest time of one minute and 26.070 seconds was {{one and a half}} seconds off Hamilton's pace in the second session. However, he received a ten-place grid penalty for changing his engine overnight, his sixth of the season. As a result, Räikkonen moved into eleventh. Räikkonen struggled with car grip and locked his front tyres, abandoning his first timed lap because cars leaving the pit lane hindered his visibility entering the Rettifilo chicane, and after preparing for his second attempt, he locked his right-front wheel and ran into the run-off area. Jean-Éric Vergne started from 12th with Hülkenberg unable to match his teammate's pace in 13th because he was delayed by slower traffic while preparing his for his lap at Parabolica and felt his car was loose. Sutil had problems driving but gradually improved his car's balance as he circulated the track and improved on his final lap to secure 14th, ahead of teammate Esteban Gutiérrez who made a slight error on his final lap. Maldonado failed to advance beyond the first qualifying session, with teammate Grosjean managing five laps after missing the opening 13 minutes while his team repaired a fluid leak discovered before qualifying. Kobayashi slipstreamed teammate Marcus Ericsson to move ahead of Jules Bianchi for 18th, with Bianchi not improving as he slid sideways through the Ascari chicane and other drivers set faster lap times on the medium compound tyres. His teammate Max Chilton qualified 20th and Ericsson completed the field in 22nd; the latter was hindered due to a lack <b>of</b> <b>decent</b> running on the medium compound tyres following an engine problem in the third practice session.|$|E

500|$|Paine's Age of Reason sparked enough {{anger in}} Britain to {{initiate}} {{not only a}} series of government prosecutions but also a pamphlet war. Around 50 unfavorable replies appeared between 1795 and 1799 alone and refutations were still being published in 1812. Many of these responded specifically to Paine's attack on the Bible in Part II (when Thomas Williams was prosecuted for printing Part II, it became clear its circulation had far exceeded that of Part I). Although critics responded to Paine's analysis of the Bible, they did not usually address his specific arguments. Instead, they advocated a literal reading of the Bible, citing the Bible's long history as evidence of its authority. They also issued ad hominem attacks against Paine, describing him [...] "as an enemy of proper thought and of the morality <b>of</b> <b>decent,</b> enlightened people". Dissenters such as Joseph Priestley who had endorsed the arguments of the Rights of Man turned away from those presented in The Age of Reason. Even the liberal Analytical Review was skeptical of Paine's claims and distanced itself from the book. Paine's deism was simply too radical for these more moderate reformers and they feared being tarred with the brush of extremism.|$|E
