5|$|Many birds {{actively}} {{defend a}} territory from <b>others</b> <b>of</b> {{the same species}} during the breeding season; maintenance of territories protects the food source for their chicks. Species that are unable to defend feeding territories, such as seabirds and swifts, often breed in colonies instead; this is thought to offer protection from predators. Colonial breeders defend small nesting sites, and competition between and within species for nesting sites can be intense.|$|E

5|$|A {{cattle egret}} will weakly defend {{the area around}} a grazing animal against <b>others</b> <b>of</b> the same species, but if the area is swamped by egrets it will give up and {{continue}} foraging elsewhere. Where numerous large animals are present, cattle egrets selectively forage around species that move at around 5–15steps per minute, avoiding faster and slower moving herds; in Africa, cattle egrets selectively forage behind plains zebras, waterbuck, blue wildebeest and Cape buffalo. Dominant birds feed nearest to the host, and obtain more food.|$|E

It was taken in the Siege of Humaitá (1868), then razed pursuant to the Treaty.|$|E

5|$|A {{major source}} of income was the export of wool. However, the fourteenth century saw a change in fortunes: the Black Death, a {{worsening}} economic climate and poor administration left the abbey (like many <b>others</b> <b>of</b> its order) with sharply declining numbers of monks and saddled with major debt. The internal discipline and morals of the community declined too: in 1400–01 it was reported to the government that the abbot of Cleeve and three other monks were leading a group of 200 bandits and attacking travellers in the region. However, things improved {{in the fifteenth century}} and despite the vast expense caused by the extravagant building projects of the last abbots, better management, access to new resources (for instance from the profits from the right to hold markets granted by the crown) and a general improvement in the circumstances facing the house meant that just prior to the dissolution Cleeve was enjoying an Indian Summer of comfortable stability.|$|E
5|$|After Symeon's death his {{writings}} were kept alive by {{small groups of}} followers, eventually {{becoming one of the}} central teachings of the hesychast movement. Many copies of his works were made in the following centuries, particularly around the 14th century, and among the Eastern Orthodox monasteries on Mt. Athos. His recognition has always been greater outside the official church, its calendar and liturgy. Historians credit this to his zealous personality, his criticism of the church hierarchy, his emphasis on direct experience of God, and some of his unorthodox teachings—including his belief that an unordained monk who had the direct experience of God was empowered to absolve <b>others</b> <b>of</b> their sins.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with those}} trivial messages, gandingans {{were also used}} in more seriously matters when {{signaling}} to <b>others</b> <b>of</b> imminent danger. During martial law, gandingans were used to warn villagers of incoming Marcos’ soldiers. Every time the villagers received the signal, they would disappear leaving the soldiers aloof until the soldiers themselves brought in a translator who told them, the gandingan {{was responsible for the}} scurry. So they arrested the gandingan player. A similar story talks about a brother of a man who stole someone’s carabao. In order to keep his brother from getting arrested, the brother set up a gandingan up in a tree and would clang it every time the police arrived to warn his brother to leave their house. But like Marcos’ soldiers, the police bought a translator and so they were finally able to arrest the theft for stealing and the brother on the gandingan for obstruction of justice.|$|E

5|$|An aggressive, {{powerful}} apex predator, the {{silvertip shark}} feeds {{on a wide}} variety of bony fishes, as well as eagle rays, smaller sharks, and cephalopods. This species dominates other requiem sharks of equal size when competing for food, and larger individuals are often heavily scarred from conflicts with <b>others</b> <b>of</b> its species. As with other members of its family, the silvertip shark is viviparous, with females giving birth to one to 11 pups in the summer. Silvertip sharks are regarded as potentially dangerous to humans, as they often approach divers quite closely. This slow-reproducing species is taken by commercial fisheries for its meat, fins, skin, cartilage, and jaws and teeth, which has apparently led to local population declines or extirpations.|$|E
5|$|At {{his death}} Gov. Belcher left {{instructions}} {{that he be}} buried with his ardent friend and cousin, Judge Jonathan Remington (1667-1745, father-in-law of William Ellery, a signer of the Declaration of Independence). The body of Judge Jonathan Remington was disinterred and placed by his side. The monument which the governor had directed to be raised over his resting-place was never erected. The tomb became the family vault of Jennisons (Gov. Belcher's granddaughter married Dr. Timothy Lindall Jennison). The site of their grave was forgotten and long search has been made for it. In the late 1800s, local historians found that Gov. Jonathan Belcher and Judge Jonathan Remington were buried in one grave in Old Burying Ground, Cambridge, Ma. Their tomb is contiguous to that of Judge Edmund Trowbridge and Edmund Trowbridge Dana. In that of Judge Trowbridge rest the remains of Washington Allston; of Chief Justice Francis Dana; of the poet Richard Henry Dana and <b>others</b> <b>of</b> the family.|$|E
5|$|Beardmore was {{sufficiently}} impressed with Shackleton to offer financial support, but other donations proved {{hard to come}} by. Nevertheless, in February 1907, Shackleton presented to the Royal Geographical Society his plans for an Antarctic expedition, the details of which, under the name British Antarctic Expedition, {{were published in the}} Royal Society's newsletter, Geographic Journal. The aim was the conquest of both the geographical South Pole and the South Magnetic Pole. Shackleton then worked hard to persuade <b>others</b> <b>of</b> his wealthy friends and acquaintances to contribute, including Sir Philip Lee Brocklehurst, who subscribed £2,000 (2011 equivalent £157,000) to secure a place on the expedition; author Campbell Mackellar; and Guinness baron Lord Iveagh, whose contribution was secured less than two weeks before the departure of the expedition ship Nimrod. On 4 August 1907, Shackleton was appointed a Member of the Royal Victorian Order, 4th Class (MVO; the present-day grade of Lieutenant).|$|E
