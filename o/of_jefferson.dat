5|$|After a brief {{stint as}} {{president}} <b>of</b> <b>Jefferson</b> College in Pennsylvania, Breckinridge returned to Kentucky, where he pastored the First Presbyterian church of Lexington, Kentucky, and was appointed superintendent {{of public education}} by Governor William Owsley.

5|$|All of {{the protagonists}} {{in the novel}} are misfits and social outcasts {{surrounded}} by an impersonal and largely antagonistic rural community, which is represented metonymically through minor or anonymous characters. Joanna Burden and Reverend Hightower are hounded by the people <b>of</b> <b>Jefferson</b> for years, in a failed effort to make them leave town. Byron Bunch, though more accepted in Jefferson, is still viewed as a mystery or simply overlooked. Both Joe Christmas and Lena Grove are orphans, strangers in town, and social outcasts, though the former draws anger and violence from the community, while the latter is looked down upon but receives generous assistance in her travels. According to Cleanth Brooks, this opposition between Joe and Lena is a pastoral reflection of {{the full spectrum of}} social alienation in modern society.|$|E

5|$|Breckinridge {{was inaugurated}} as {{president}} <b>of</b> <b>Jefferson</b> College on September 27, 1845. During his tenure, he also pastored {{a church in}} the city of Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. College administration apparently did not suit him, however. A student uprising against the president and the faculty occurred in 1846, hastening the end of his short stay at the school. A desire to see his children, most of whom were living with relatives scattered throughout Kentucky and Virginia, also factored into his decision to resign his post in 1847. On his resignation, he was awarded an honorary LL.D from the school.|$|E

Instead, he proposed to take the boat south, first calling at Dover where he would get rid <b>of</b> <b>Jefferson,</b> who was not included in his further plans. At this stage Orsborne was apparently undecided as to his longer-term intentions, but indicated that they would be sailing into southern waters and might go fishing for pearls.|$|E

5|$|In 1844, Breckinridge's wife Ann died.

He was offered pastorate of the Second Presbyterian Church of Lexington, Kentucky, but instead, accepted the presidency <b>of</b> <b>Jefferson</b> College in Pennsylvania in 1845 against the advice of his brothers John and William. A rift between Breckinridge and his brother Cabell's widow and other relatives may help account for this surprising decision. He did not feel he could yet return to his home state.|$|E
