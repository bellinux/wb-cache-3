25|$|There {{are many}} reasons why {{underwater}} archaeology can make {{a significant contribution to}} our knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> <b>In</b> the shipwreck field alone, individual shipwrecks can be of significant historical importance either because of the magnitude of loss of life (such as the Titanic) or circumstances of loss (Housatonic was the first vessel in history sunk by an enemy submarine). Shipwrecks such as Mary Rose can also be important for archaeology because they can form a kind of accidental time capsule, preserving an assemblage of human artifacts at the moment in time when the ship was lost.|$|E

In 1963, Menzies ordered Moses not to broadcast a BBC interview with Georges Bidault, the former Prime Minister of France, who was living in exile after conspiring against the government of Charles de Gaulle. Moses sent copies of the video to commercial stations, and it was broadcast by the Nine Network in Sydney and the Seven Network in Melbourne.|$|E
25|$|The IWW {{competed for}} {{the hearts and}} minds of members with the communist-dominated unions, and held union locals well into the 1940s. With the younger {{generation}} rapidly being assimilated into dominant Canadian society, the IWW and CTKL in Northwestern Ontario became friendship and mutual aid societies for an aging membership. In the late 1960s, following the last major wave of Finnish immigration to Canada, a new organization called the Finlandia Club of Port Arthur became the majority share holder of the hall. The new wave of immigrants were a generation separated from their Finnish-Canadian brethren and had no connection to the social struggles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> <b>In</b> addition, the newly arriving immigrants were either a-political or conservative, associating any left-wing activity with the brutality of Stalinism and the Finnish Winter War; this despite the fact that the Finnish Wobblies in Canada and the U.S. had actively supported and aided Finland in the war against the Soviet Union and denounced Bolshevism, from a libertarian socialist perspective, since the Kronstadt uprising.|$|E

25|$|The jō, {{like its}} larger sibling the Bō, {{was never an}} {{effective}} killing-weapon on the battlefield {{in comparison to the}} sword, spear, glaive and bow. Although the jō and most other staves could be used to lethal effect when thrust at vital points of the body, when faced with a fully armored opponent those vital points would in most cases be covered by armour-plating. As a result, there were very few ryu that were dedicated to the staff-arts in the warring era with other more effective weapons were available, but there are several ryu that include jō techniques in its system. One example is the jō-tradition found in the koryū art Tendō-ryū Naginatajutsu, founded in 1582. In Tendō-ryū, which uses the Naginata as the primary weapon, there are techniques with the jō that simulates a scenario where the naginata has been cut in two and the wielder has to defend himself with the staff-portion only. With the onset of peace with the start of the Edo-period (1603–1867), the conflicts with heavy armored warriors became a thing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> <b>In</b> this era, the jō art would come into its own against non-armored samurai, rōnin, bandits, and other opponents. It was extensively used to police the local clan domains.|$|E
25|$|Tuten spent 15 years {{heading the}} {{graduate}} program in creative {{writing at the}} City College of New York, which he co-founded.

Tuten's short fiction has appeared in Granta, Conjunctions, Fence, Fiction, The New Review of Literature, Tri-Quarterly, and Harper's Magazine. In 1973, he received a Guggenheim Fellowship for Creative Writing and in 2001 was given the Award for Distinguished Writing from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In describing his usage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>in</b> his novels (where many of them are set), Tuten once stated:The fact that I don’t write about contemporary life doesn’t mean I’m any less taken up with it. I find it too limiting to write about contemporary life just in contemporary diction, however. I don’t think there's enough flexibility. I can imagine writing about characters who feel passion for one another in a contemporary setting but I don’t, as yet, hear the language for that. But I’m always thinking about contemporary life vis a vis the way it looks in the past. I mean how it looks in the past is a reflection of what it is today. That's what interests me. I think I’m always talking about present-day life, not only political life but about the quality of passion, the quality of all relationships and love.|$|E
