5|$|There {{are only}} three stars in the {{constellation}} brighter than magnitude 4.5, and 37stars with a magnitude brighter than 6.5. Leo Minor {{does not have a}} star designated Alpha because Baily erred and allocated a Greek letter to only one star, Beta. It is unclear whether he intended to give 46Leonis Minoris a Bayer designation, as he recognized Beta and 46Leonis Minoris as <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appropriate</b> brightness in his catalogue. He died before revising his proofs, which might explain this star's omission.|$|E
5|$|This list {{of space}} telescopes (astronomical space observatories) is grouped by major {{frequency}} ranges: gamma ray, x-ray, ultraviolet, visible, infrared, microwave and radio.

Space telescopes that collect particles, such as cosmic ray nuclei and/or electrons, as well as instruments that aim to detect gravitational waves, are also listed. Missions with specific targets within the Solar System (e.g. our Sun and its planets), are excluded; see List of Solar System probes for these, and List of Earth observation satellites for missions targeting our planet.|$|E

40|$|Sequence mining is an {{important}} data mining task. In order to retrieve interesting sequences from a large database, a minimum support threshold is needed to be specified. Unfortunately, specification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appropriated</b> support threshold {{is very difficult for}} users who are novice to mining queries and task specific data. To avoid this difficulty <b>of</b> specification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appropriated</b> support threshold, this paper is proposed to mine k most frequent closed sequences consisting of events containing a single item. This is called top-k closed sequences. This mining not only provides an easy way to retrieve interesting sequences but also gives <b>the</b> compact representation <b>of</b> sequences. In this paper, an efficient algorithm, called TKS, is also proposed for mining top-k closed sequences without candidate maintenance. In addition, it produces closed sequences in support descending in order to avoid finding <b>the</b> <b>appropriated</b> support threshold before mining phase...|$|R

5|$|For the Chemical Troops (Nebeltruppen) each {{decontamination}} battery (Entgiftungs-Batterie) {{was authorized}} six Sd.Kfz. 10/1 and six Sd.Kfz. 10/2. Eighteen Sd.Kfz. 10/3 {{were held at}} the battalion level for issue to the batteries in lieu of their Sd.Kfz. 10/2s if needed. If necessary they could be substituted for Sd.Kfz. 11s <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appropriate</b> type. When the decontamination units were authorized to be re-equipped with heavy rocket launchers in November 1941 seven Sd.Kfz. 10/1s were used to tow the 28/32 cm Nebelwerfer 41 launchers and another {{was used by the}} platoon leader to tow an anti-tank gun. Similarly decontamination units usually retained their Sd.Kfz. 10/2s and used them just like the 10/1s after removing their special equipment. However, it seems that the 10/3s were turned in when the unit was reorganized.|$|E
5|$|Games {{last longer}} than their defined length due to play {{stoppages}} – the average NFL game lasts slightly over three hours. Time in a football game {{is measured by the}} game clock. An operator is responsible for starting, stopping and operating the game clock based on the direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appropriate</b> official. A separate clock, the play clock, is used to determine if a delay of game infraction has been committed. If the play clock expires before the ball has been snapped or free-kicked, a delay of game foul is called on the offense. The play clock is set to 40 seconds in professional and college football and to 25 seconds in high school play or following certain administrative stoppages in the former levels of play.|$|E
5|$|Just as {{the image}} of the wife in {{advertising}} has reflected the general views <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appropriate</b> roles of a wife, images of the husband also reflect the cultural values surrounding what role was believed a husband should be engaged in. For example, over time, it is common find images of the husband as performing work outside of the home and taking care of the family finances. It has been noted that this role has been especially prevalent during 1920, 1936, and 1970. On the other hand, one is not likely to find an advertisement depicting husbands engaged in household chores, except when they are depicted as particularly bad at performing the housework. In addition, it has been noted that over time, the portrayal of husbands and wives in an intimate, romantic relationship has been on the rise.|$|E

5|$|Organisms vary {{in their}} ability to {{synthesize}} the 20 common amino acids. Most bacteria and plants can synthesize all twenty, but mammals can only synthesize eleven nonessential amino acids, so nine essential amino acids must be obtained from food. Some simple parasites, such as the bacteria Mycoplasma pneumoniae, lack all amino acid synthesis and take their amino acids directly from their hosts. All amino acids are synthesized from intermediates in glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, or the pentose phosphate pathway. Nitrogen is provided by glutamate and glutamine. Amino acid synthesis depends on the formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appropriate</b> alpha-keto acid, which is then transaminated to form an amino acid.|$|E
5|$|Section 10 {{requires}} the authorisation of any prosecution {{by the director}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appropriate</b> prosecution agency before a case can go ahead; this is a shift from the old regime, which required {{the consent of the}} Attorney General for England and Wales. Section 11 explains the penalties for individuals and companies found guilty of committing a crime. If an individual is found guilty of a bribery offence, tried as a summary offence, they may be imprisoned for up to 12 months and fined up to £5,000. Someone found guilty on indictment, however, faces up to 10 years' imprisonment and an unlimited fine. The crime of a commercial organisation failing to prevent bribery is punishable by an unlimited fine. In addition, a convicted individual or organisation may be subject to a confiscation order under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, while a company director who is convicted may be disqualified under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanics}} of crafting and gathering have changed between the original release and A Realm Reborn.

Crafting abilities have been rebalanced to allow successful high-quality synthesis without requiring multiple mastered Disciplines of the Hand. For Disciples of the Land, players are allowed to select which item {{they would like to}} attempt to collect at a gathering point, whereas before, the results of gathering attempts were randomized. The Gathering Log also displays the names and locations of items that can be gathered in the world.|$|E

5|$|With the {{prospects}} of {{a link between the}} navigation and the Basingstoke Canal being constructed, the undertaking was valued at £24,000, and D'Arcy sold a half share in it to his agent, George Hollis. He then sold the other half to him, and moved to Ireland. Hollis became the sole proprietor from 1804, having bought out his sleeping partner. Throughout its life, the navigation had almost been a monopoly, but Hollis planned to end this, and obtained an Act of Parliament in 1802, to make it an open navigation, where anyone could use it on payment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appropriate</b> tolls. These were laid down in the Act, ending the setting of tolls by the Commissioners. The Act also specified that he had three years to put the river in order, which he appears to have achieved, since he then leased it to a group of merchants.|$|E
