The album was originally scheduled for an early 2010 release, but Shinoda was concerned with [...] "the quality of the tunes" [...] and said, [...] "if we need to take a step back and make sure everything is top, top quality by <b>our</b> <b>standards,</b> we will". Shinoda also said that, in comparison to Minutes to Midnight, the new album would have a bigger [...] "thread of consistency" [...] and would be more experimental and [...] "hopefully more cutting-edge".|$|E

I felt no constraints. Nothing I did in my book is as mean as any of the people I wrote about." [...] She was {{similarly}} unrepentant about her subsequent expatriation, saying [...] "I wasn't a pariah because I was a drug-addicted, alcoholic, rotten person and not a good mother. I was a pariah because I hit them with a harsh, fluorescent light and rendered them as contemptible as they truly are." ...|$|E
500|$|Milan {{entered the}} match the fresher {{of the two}} teams, but Simon Barnes commented in his Times match preview that Arsenal's biggest asset was their [...] "sheer bloody mindedness." [...] The club's indiscipline was a major talking point before the game, as two players were sent off in defeat to Sheffield Wednesday the {{previous}} Saturday. Graham's future was also called in question, after claims that he received illegal payments from transfer deals (bungs), which he dismissed. In his pre-match news conference, the Arsenal manager spoke highly of European football and was eager to win another trophy for the club: [...] "We are having a bad season by <b>our</b> <b>standards</b> and any win in any cup is worth something." ...|$|E
500|$|Smith {{wrote to}} Wilson {{the day after}} the referendum, asking him to send Bottomley to Salisbury for talks. Wilson replied that Smith should instead come to London. The British and Rhodesians {{exchanged}} often confrontational letters for the next few months. Alluding to the British financial aid pledged to Salisbury as part of the Federal dissolution arrangements, Wilson's High Commissioner in Salisbury, JB Johnston, wrote to the Rhodesian Cabinet Secretary GeraldB Clarke on 23 December that [...] "talk of a unilateral declaration of independence is bound to throw a shadow of uncertainty on the future financial relations between the two governments". Smith was furious, seeing this as blackmail, and on 13 January 1965 wrote to Wilson: [...] "I am so incensed at the line of your High Commissioner's letter that I am replying directly to you... It would appear that any undertakings given by the British government are worthless... such immoral behaviour {{on the part of the}} British government makes it impossible for me to continue negotiations with you with any confidence that <b>our</b> <b>standards</b> of fair play, honesty and decency will prevail." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{record is}} highly {{regarded}} {{among the members}} of U2. Mullen said, [...] "I {{thought it was a great}} record. I was very proud of it. Its success was by no means preordained. It was a real break from what we had done before and we didn't know if our fans would like it or not." [...] Bono called the album a [...] "pivot point" [...] in the band's career, saying, [...] "Making Achtung Baby is the reason we're still here now." [...] Clayton concurred, saying, [...] "If we hadn't done something we were excited about, that made us apprehensive and challenged everything we stood for, then there would really have been no reason to carry on... If it hadn't been a great record by <b>our</b> <b>standards,</b> the existence of the band would have been threatened." [...] The group's reinvention occurred at the peak of the alternative rock movement, when the genre was achieving widespread mainstream popularity. Bill Flanagan pointed out that many of U2's 1980s contemporaries struggled commercially with albums released after the turn of the decade. He argued that U2, however, were able to take advantage of the alternative rock movement and ensure a successful future by [...] "set themselves up as the first of the new groups rather than the last of the old". Toby Creswell echoed these sentiments in his 2006 music reference book 1001 Songs, writing that the album helped U2 avoid [...] "becoming parodies of themselves and being swept aside by the grunge and techno revolutions". AllMusic called the album [...] "a pivotal moment for dance-rock, happening late in the game but showing that even the biggest young band in the world had an eye on the dancefloor". A 2010 retrospective by Spin said that [...] "U2 became the emblematic band of the alternative-rock era with Achtung Baby." ...|$|E

[...] The Court noted that the [...] "prospect of torture induces fear and its consequences may be devastating, irreversible, indeed, fatal." [...] This view of torture goes back to R. v.

In the summer, David Beckham also moved to Real Madrid, while Juan Sebastián Verón joined Chelsea. United in the meantime rebuilt their team: Tim Howard replaced Barthez in goal and Kléberson, Eric Djemba-Djemba and Cristiano Ronaldo came in to bolster the squad. Ronaldinho might have also joined [...] "had he not said yes, then no, to our offer". Ferguson admitted the signings the club made did not work out in hindsight: [...] "We rushed down the path of buying in proven players – who we thought would match <b>our</b> <b>standards</b> right away." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fisk {{enjoyed the}} best {{reputation}} among all Black colleges for its teacher training programs. McKenzie {{saw an opportunity}} for Fisk to provide continuing education for Black teachers from throughout the South during the summer months, and requested permission to begin a summer session in 1916. McKenzie envisioned Fisk as a center for teacher training. [...] "We should not only set standards for advanced training for teachers in this state, but we would {{meet the needs of}} those capable of meeting <b>our</b> <b>standards</b> throughout a large number of the Southern states." [...] In early 1917, The General Education Board expressed interest in funding the program. However, with the outbreak of World War I and increasing economic uncertainty throughout the country, the foundation reconsidered and [...] "deemed it wise to [...] postpone the consideration of a summer school on account of the war." [...] It was not until 1920-21, five years after McKenzie first proposed the idea, that Fisk established a summer school program for teachers.|$|E

It was not fatal at the time for in 1956 South Africa {{did not have the}} cricketing resources to expose our indulgence". It was enough to turn a 2–0 lead for the tourists into a 2–2 draw against Clive van Ryneveld's energetic team. The all-rounder Trevor Bailey opened the innings with Peterson and Cowdrey returned to batting at number 5, where he made 331 runs (33.10). He made 59 and took three catches in the First Test at the New Wanderers in Johannesburg and made his second Test century – 101 in 369 minutes – in the Second at Cape Town, which England won by an innings, and batted for 200 minutes making 55 in the second innings of the Fourth back at Johannesburg when Hugh Tayfield took 9/113 in South Africa's 17 run win.|$|E
