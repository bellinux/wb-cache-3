25|$|Due to its {{enclosed}} sub-surface platforms, New Street {{was designated}} as an underground station {{by the fire}} service. In the 1990s a number of changes {{had to be made}} to the station in order to comply with stricter fire regulations, introduced for underground stations {{as a result of the}} 1987 King's Cross fire. In 1993, a new enclosed footbridge was opened at the Wolverhampton end of the station, with access to the platforms separate from the main building: this was built primarily as a fire exit, but the new exit from the station into Navigation Street was opened to the public. All wooden fittings were removed from the platforms, and new fire doors were also installed at the foot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>and</b> elevators on the platforms.|$|E
25|$|The wide stairs {{leading from}} the subway land in the {{southern}} third of the building at a ticket hall and waiting area, which is open on both sides. A painted steel mid-rail runs the length of these stairs. Opposite the stair void the gaps between the piers are filled with screens made with a metal frame and grill panel bolted to the brick surrounds and resting on low brick walls. The internal faces of the piers are rendered and painted. The ticket windows are directly opposite the stair landing. Only the western one is currently in use, the other now hidden behind a freestanding automatic ticket machine. A number of timetable wall-boxes line the available wall space, one being an early timber example. One of the original chrome-plated ticket rails {{in front of the}} operating ticket window remains. The floor is lined with a chequered pattern of black and white terrazzo tiles, while the ceiling is made with fibrous cement sheeting. A stainless steel downpipe marks the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>and</b> the endpoint of the middle handrail. There were four downpipes in the original design, one next to what had been the telephone box on the south-eastern facade, another between the office and store and another between the toilet and waiting area. How many still exist is unknown as three were enclosed in various walls along the centreline of the building and cannot be viewed. It is likely that some if not all remain.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine whether a common perceptual {{parameter}} {{is available for}} guiding old adults, young adults and children in climbing <b>the</b> highest <b>stair</b> mountable in a bipedal fashion. Previous works {{have shown that the}} ratio between <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hip height was the body-scaled invariance adopted as information for selecting <b>the</b> highest <b>stair</b> by young adults [Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance 10 (1984) 683 - 703] but not by older adults [Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance 3 (1992) 691 - 697]. Indeed, for older adults additional bio-mechanical parameters needed {{to be added to the}} model due to their decrease in leg strength and flexibility. Up to now, no perceptual invariant has been identified yet for determining the relevant information used for guiding <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> climbing action for normal healthy people. We propose a new parameter as the angle defined by the ratio between <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> distance taken from the feet to <b>the</b> top edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> before <b>the</b> initiation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> movement. We show that this angle is the same for children, young adults and older adults despite <b>the</b> different kinematics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> motion, the anthropometrics and the skill ability exhibit by the participants. In summary we show that even when the climbability judgments, based on the simple ratio leg length-stair height, are influenced by differences in age, participants use a common perceptual variable when they are coordinating their stair climbing action...|$|R

However, he stood at the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>and</b> decided not to go, eventually deciding to go to architecture school (as his parents wanted) where he met his wife. Kove's inspiration was drawn from the fact that her existence seemed to hinge on that decision, because [...] "if the artist had said, 'Oh, you must paint,' you know, then in all likelihood he would never have met my mother, and, you know, that would have been it for my chances." [...] However, Kove felt the story was too personal, and rewrote it to be fictional.|$|E
500|$|As {{initially}} constructed, {{the interior}} was relatively open with two-rail handrails, {{but a couple of}} suicides and an accidental fall prompted the addition of tall wire screening ( [...] high with a large diamond mesh) on the inside edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>and</b> landings in 1929. The original steam powered elevator, which took 10 to 12 minutes to ascend to the observation floor, was replaced by an electric elevator powered by an on-site dynamo in 1901 which took five minutes to ascend. The monument was connected to the electrical grid in 1923, allowing the installation of a modern electric elevator in 1925–26 which took 70 seconds. The latter was replaced in 1958 and again in 1998 by 70-second elevators. During 1997–2000, the wire screening at three platforms was replaced by large glass panels to allow visitors on the elevator to view three clusters of memorial stones that were synchronously lit as the elevator automatically slowed as it passed them during its descent.|$|E

Paul continues to clean, but sees the bullethole in the cushion, and then the suitcase being lowered outside the window. Gerald heads outside to investigate, but Eddie and Ray drop the case on his head. The burglars run past Paul and look out to see the canvas in the pool, before both being shot by Paul. Paul rings someone and says [...] "Hello, it's me. Yeah, it's done." [...] He looks to the fake painting, and says [...] "I've got it right here. Yeah, it's fine. Not a peep out of anyone."

As they finished their performance, the backdrops started displaying Madonna's images from her music videos. The band—consisting of guitarists, bassists, a drummer and three synthesizer players—came into focus, and the music started. Madonna's voice was heard, saying: [...] "Don't be afraid... it's gonna be alright." [...] Then, Madonna's silhouette appeared behind a white screen {{on top of the}} stairs as the first beats kicked in. The white screen lifted and she is finally seen, wearing a psychedelic housecoat, a blue see-through crop-top and her characteristic black bra. She also had lacy leggings and crucifixes around her ear and her neck. She posed on the stairs before reaching the microphone to sing [...] "Dress You Up". After dancing to the last note of the music, Madonna and the two male back-up dancers went {{to the back of the}} stage, as the music of [...] "Holiday" [...] began. Taking a moment to ask the audience how they are feeling, Madonna declared, [...] "I was never elected homecoming queen, but I sure feel like one now", and started the performance of [...] "Into the Groove", playing a tambourine. A boombox was present on the stage during the performance, Madonna sitting and playing with it, and addressing it as her [...] "box".
