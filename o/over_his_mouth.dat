5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) arrives to {{the office}} with a fake {{mustache}} to hide {{what he thinks is}} a pimple <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> Michael soon learns that it is a cold sore, and he over-reacts, thinking he has herpes. With some prodding from Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), Michael decides to tell his former lovers he has herpes, despite not yet having gone to a doctor. He calls Donna (Amy Pietz) first, abruptly telling her to get tested. Michael then calls Holly Flax (Amy Ryan), joking around with her before they have a more serious discussion. Much to Michael's dismay, she claims that he over-romanticized their relationship, and he hangs up without telling her about the herpes. Michael and Dwight drive out to tell Carol Stills (Nancy Carell), Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin), and Pam's mother, Helene Beesly (Linda Purl).|$|E

25|$|In December 2007, The Washington Post {{reported}} {{that there were some}} discrepancies regarding reports about the number of times Zubaydah was waterboarded. According to a previous account by former CIA officer John Kiriakou, Abu Zubaydah broke after just 35seconds of waterboarding, which involved stretching cellophane <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> and nose and pouring water on his face to create the sensation of drowning. Kiriakou later admitted that he had no first hand knowledge of the interrogation and accused the CIA of using him to spread disinformation.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, both Japanese {{military}} personnel, {{especially the}} Kempeitai, {{and the officers}} of the Gestapo, the German secret police, used waterboarding {{as a method of}} torture. During the Japanese occupation of Singapore, the Double Tenth Incident occurred. This included waterboarding, by the method of binding or holding down the victim on his back, placing a cloth <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> and nose, and pouring water onto the cloth. In this version, interrogation continued during the torture, with the interrogators beating the victim if he did not reply and the victim swallowing water if he opened his mouth to answer or breathe. When the victim could ingest no more water, the interrogators would beat or jump on his distended stomach.|$|E
500|$|During the offseasons, Bostic was {{a regular}} on the Oilers' summer {{basketball}} team that traveled around the state raising money for charities by playing various local All-star teams. After the team's twelfth season, Bostic {{had a reputation as}} the best player ever to play for the team. [...] During one NFL training camp Bostic played with tape <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> to try to win a $20 bet with Steve Brown over who could keep from talking the longest.|$|E

500|$|Apple Records {{released}} [...] "Photograph", {{backed by}} [...] "Down and Out", on 24 September 1973 in America, and on 19 October in Britain. Starr made a promotional film for [...] "Photograph", {{in which he}} mimed to the song while walking through the grounds of Tittenhurst Park, the Berkshire estate that he had recently purchased from former bandmate John Lennon. To circumvent the BBC's ban on lip-synching, Starr placed his hand <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> {{for part of the}} song, thereby making it impossible to tell whether he was singing or merely miming. The single's picture sleeve consisted of a photo by Barry Feinstein that showed Starr's head poking through a large star made of silver foil. The same image, which author Bruce Spizer terms [...] "the Ringo starfish", appeared on the single's face labels and on those of the Ringo album.|$|E
500|$|Robin Williams {{initially}} {{wanted to}} sing a humorous song written by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman during {{the presentation of the}} Best Animated Feature award satirizing the controversy regarding Focus on the Family and a music video sponsored by We Are Family Foundation featuring animated characters such as SpongeBob SquarePants singing the song [...] "We Are Family". The song contained lyrics [...] such as [...] "Pinocchio's had his nose done! Sleeping Beauty is popping pills!/ The Three Little Pigs ain't kosher! Betty Boop works Beverly Hills!" [...] However, Cates and ABC officials deemed the song overly vulgar and offensive for the telecast and was dropped altogether after writers Shaiman and Wittman had trouble rewriting more appropriate lyrics. Williams eventually presented the Best Animated Feature award as scheduled, but silently mocked the debacle by entering the stage with duct tape <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> before speaking.|$|E
500|$|Gatiss {{wrote in}} the script for the Daleks' {{redesign}} to be [...] "big buggers...bigger than we've seen them before". The eyestalk {{was designed to be}} level with Smith's eyeline. Moffat and Gatiss wanted the new Daleks to be very colourful, similar to the Daleks of films from the 60s. Gatiss originally wanted there to be a green Dalek, but he decided that green [...] "just doesn't seem to work somehow". Nick Briggs, who voiced the Daleks, planned to counter their bright colours with a more vicious voice. Moffat wanted to somehow incorporate [...] "Spitfires in space". A replica of a World War II Spitfire was used in front of a greenscreen to shoot the live action parts of the scene and the image of the Spitfire, {{while the rest of the}} scene was computer-generated. The sequence contained the line [...] "Broadsword to Danny Boy", a reference to a similar line in the film Where Eagles Dare. Gatiss provided the voice of the Spitfire pilot himself, doing one version clean and another with his hand <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> In an interview in April 2010, Gatiss described how the cameo came about: ...|$|E
50|$|Typical of {{the mystic}} crucifixes {{is the body}} of Christ hanging on a Y-shaped tree fork with his head falling low <b>over</b> <b>his</b> chest, <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> contorted with pain and his eyes full of tears. His narrow, sinewy arms stretch more upward than sideways, his thin body is {{strongly}} bent and deeply sunken below the breastbone, with prominently protruding ribs and a gaping wound in his side. Fingers and toes are spread apart and spasmodically bent. The overall impression of the painted figure {{was intended to be}} so horrific that believers would be in fear and terror. It is recorded that in 1306 the Bishop of London removed a mystic crucifix for this reason.|$|R

500|$|South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut was {{nominated}} for an Academy Award for Best Original Song for [...] "Blame Canada". When {{the time came to}} perform the track live at the ceremony, as is customary for the Academy Awards, it ran into trouble with ABC's standards and practices department: censors demanded they write TV-friendly lyrics. [...] "It would be ironic to have to change the words in a movie about censorship," [...] remarked Shaiman. Censors were particularly unhappy {{with the use of the}} word [...] "fuck" [...] and allusions to the Ku Klux Klan. When Parker and Shaiman declined these requests, Robin Williams, a friend of Shaiman's, sang the song with black tape <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> and turning his back when curse words were to be sung. Parker and Stone attended the ceremony in drag, wearing replicas of dresses previously worn at the Oscars by Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Lopez. The two claimed years later that they took acid before the ceremony and were high while wearing the outfits. The song ended up losing to [...] "You'll Be in My Heart", a Tarzan song by Phil Collins (that film came from ABC parent Disney). In response, Parker and Stone ridiculed him in two consecutive episodes of the series' fourth season ("Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000" [...] and [...] "Timmy 2000"). In DVD commentary, Parker states [...] "we were fully expecting to lose, just not to Phil Collins".|$|E

'A bottle of whiskey!' he almost shouted. I clapped my hand <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> News that whiskey was in the camp was likely to cause a raid... I will say in passing that I don't believe there is another scout in the West that would have brought a full bottle of whiskey 300 miles." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tamino wakes up, and is {{surprised}} to find himself still alive. Papageno enters dressed as a bird. He describes {{his life as a}} bird-catcher, complaining he has no wife or girlfriend (aria: [...] ""). Tamino introduces himself to Papageno, thinking Papageno killed the serpent. Papageno happily takes the credit – claiming he strangled it with his bare hands. The three ladies suddenly reappear and instead of giving him wine, cake and figs, they give him water, a stone and place a padlock <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> as a warning not to lie.

2500|$|The first [...] "Mad Money Main Event" [...] was {{broadcast}} on July20, 2005. Cramer had his show taped {{in front of}} a live studio audience of about 150 guests. The show was promoted on CNBC using commercials that showed Cramer locked up in a padded room in a straitjacket and tape <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> as if in a mental institution (a reference to Cramer's book, the subtitle of which is [...] "Sane Investing in an Insane World"). The [...] "Main Event" [...] was introduced by boxing announcer Michael Buffer with his catch phrase [...] "Let's get ready to rumble!". The featured guest on the show was then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer (a classmate of Cramer at Harvard Law School). Cramer went into the crowd and gave high fives to audience members who claimed to have had made money by following his stock tips. True to the commercials, it featured a segment titled [...] "Am I Nuts?", which had audience members asking Cramer about their stocks. Mad Money was expanded to a special 90 minute edition for this occasion.|$|E
2500|$|Sweeney was ejected {{in a game}} {{versus the}} Detroit Tigers on August 10 (1st career ejection) after {{charging}} pitcher Jeff Weaver in the sixth inning. Weaver, {{who was a member}} of the Tigers at the time, was pitching to Sweeney. In between pitches, Sweeney asked the home plate umpire if Weaver could [...] be asked to move the rosin bag from the top of the mound. After that, Weaver put his glove <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> and appeared to say something [...] "Webster never put in his dictionary" [...] to Sweeney. Sweeney was offended and launched his batting helmet at Weaver while charging the pitcher's mound. He eventually tackled Weaver, igniting a bench-clearing brawl. Sweeney said afterwards that Weaver had been criticizing the Royals' younger players and Sweeney's faith. Sweeney's teammates did not deny his comments. Paul Byrd was one of the first to aid Sweeney as he held back the Tigers catcher so that Sweeney could reach Weaver. Sweeney missed the next 15 games, five due to a [...] "bruised hand" [...] and the next ten to serve a suspension, his first career suspension (prior to that, he had played in 171 consecutive games).|$|E

[...] He had been reported missing from work three days earlier while working on the American Community Survey for the U.S. Census, covering a local five county area. Sparkman was reportedly found with a rope around his neck, tied to a tree while {{in contact with the}} ground, wearing only socks, with the word [...] "fed" [...] written on his chest [...] in felt-tip marker. It was reported in the media that the word had been written upside-down or from an upside-down point of view and therefore, the police eventually concluded, by Sparkman himself. [...] His census ID was taped to the side of his neck. He was gagged, with duct tape around his hands and feet and <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> and eyes. [...] Kentucky State Police criticized many media reports of the death, such as asserting that he was hanging from a tree when he was actually tied to a tree with a rope around his neck.|$|E

2500|$|The Game {{released}} a controversial artwork {{of the album}} via Instagram on October 21, 2012 and also announced the release date will be December 11. The cover portrays a dark-skinned Jesus in a stained glass window with a teardrop tattoo, a red bandanna around his mouth, and wearing a Jesus piece. The stained glass-inspired image shows Jesus sitting on a throne adorned with gang-related symbols. In the artwork, Jesus is holding a gold [...] "Jesus Piece" [...] chain and pointing to a symbol on his breast plate. The red bandana <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> is {{a reference to the}} Cedar Block Piru Bloods gang, to which Game is allegedly a member. The artwork has a slightly altered logo on the top, which features on all of Game's previous studio albums. The album's title Jesus Piece is stylized as Je5us Piece, depicting that it is Game's fifth studio album. Je5us Piece logo is styled after the iconic Louis Vuitton. The cover was designed by Mike Saputo. The religious imagery of the art has gained mixed reactions and the ire of some fans who deem the work as blasphemous. Several celebrities praised the artwork, including Busta Rhymes, Mac Miller and Kevin Hart. However, The Game decided to make this cover for the deluxe edition after the Roman Catholic Church complained to Interscope Records about it. Complex named the album cover the fifteenth best cover of 2012. On November 12, an alternative cover for the standard edition of the album was released. This cover paid homage to one of The Game's older brothers, Jevon Danell Taylor, who was shot and killed at the age of 20 on May 21, 1995.|$|E

60|$|Anon {{those who}} watched and who {{happened}} to be facing the interior of the barn saw sparks from a tinder flying in every direction: the next moment they could see Pierre himself quite clearly. He was {{standing in the middle of}} the barn and intent on lighting a roughly-fashioned torch with his tinder: soon the resin caught a spark and Pierre held the torch inclined toward the ground so that the flames could lick their way up the shaft. The flickering light cast a weird glow and deep grotesque shadows upon the face and figure of the young man. His hair, lanky and dishevelled, fell <b>over</b> <b>his</b> eyes; <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> and jaw, illumined from below by the torch, looked unnaturally large, and showed his teeth gleaming white, like the fangs of a beast of prey. His shirt was torn open at the neck, and the sleeves of his coat were rolled up to the elbow. He seemed not to feel either the cold from without or the scorching heat of the flaming torch in his hand. But he worked deliberately and calmly, without haste or febrile movements: grim determination held his excitement in check.|$|R
