Oocytes {{of various}} sizes were {{isolated}} from ovaries <b>of</b> sexu-ally <b>mature</b> and prepubertal hamsters and cultured to determine whether all the oocytes were capable <b>of</b> <b>maturing</b> in vitro. It was found that only the oocytes that had attained maximum size (about 80 =m the vitelline diameter) were capable of undergoing maturation in vitro. Smaller oocytes (< 80 =m diameter) failed either to initiate or to com-plete maturation. The oocytes which were capable <b>of</b> <b>maturing</b> in vitro(competent oocytes) {{were present in the}} ovaries of adult females 136 to 138 hr before ovulation. The competent oocytes first appeared in the ovaries of prepubertal females on the 23 rd day after birth, about 10 days before puberty...|$|R

A single sporangiophore (the fruiting structure) is produced from the semispherical protoplasmodium, which is approximately {{one and a}} half times the diameter <b>of</b> <b>mature</b> sporangia. It acquires dark spots as it matures and the centre of the protoplasm later becomes dark. Then, the transparent and milk-white protoplasmodium climbs along the stem to the top, where first the capillitium and peridium and finally the spores are produced. At room temperature, this process lasts roughly one day.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the best fit non-linear regression model to describe the growth pattern of Bali cows. Estimates <b>of</b> asymptotic <b>mature</b> weight, rate <b>of</b> <b>maturing</b> and constant <b>of</b> integration were derived from Brody, von Bertalanffy, Gompertz and Logistic models which were fitted to cross-sectional data of body weight taken from 74 Bali cows raised in MARDI Research Station Muadzam Shah Pahang. Coefficient of determination (R 2) and residual mean squares (MSE) were used to determine the best fit model in describing the growth pattern of Bali cows. Von Bertalanffy model was the best model among the four growth functions evaluated to determine the <b>mature</b> weight <b>of</b> Bali cattle as shown by the highest R 2 and lowest MSE values (0. 973 and 601. 9, respectively), followed by Gompertz (0. 972 and 621. 2, respectively), Logistic (0. 971 and 648. 4, respectively) and Brody (0. 932 and 660. 5, respectively) models. The correlation between rate <b>of</b> <b>maturing</b> and mature weight was found to be negative in the range of - 0. 170 to - 0. 929 for all models, indicating that animals <b>of</b> heavier <b>mature</b> weight had lower rate <b>of</b> <b>maturing.</b> The use <b>of</b> non-linear model could summarize the weight-age relationship into several biologically interpreted parameters compared to the entire lifespan weight-age data points that are difficult and time consuming to interpret...|$|R

5|$|EFS {{has mostly}} a repressive role of EFS on {{processes}} {{associated with the}} activation <b>of</b> <b>mature</b> T-cells, including IL-2 pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and IL-2-dependent clonal expansion of T cells. Upon T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, EFS dephosphorylation and release of the SRC family kinase FYN and phospholipase C-γ normally lead to self-limitation of the immune response. Consistent with this mechanism, EFS overexpression in T cell-derived cell lines decreased IL-2 concentration in supernatants in response to TCR stimulation, while T cells derived from mice lacking EFS gene showed increased IL-2 production. A dual role of EFS in mature T cells function has been proposed because both overexpression and siRNA knockdown of this protein in cell models resulted in decreased transcriptional activation of IL-2 dependent promoters following TCR stimulation.|$|E
