25|$|Because chronic self-concepts and {{self-esteem}} {{play an important}} role in understanding the world, providing a sense of coherence, and guiding action, people become motivated to maintain them through self-verification. Such strivings provide stability to people’s lives, making their experiences more coherent, orderly, and comprehensible than they would be otherwise. Self-verification processes are also adaptive for groups, groups of diverse backgrounds and the larger society, in that they make people predictable to one another thus serve to facilitate social interaction. To this end, people engage in a variety <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> <b>that</b> are designed to obtain self-verifying information.|$|E

25|$|Porter's 1985 {{description}} of the value chain refers to the chain of activities (processes or collections of processes) that an organization performs in order to deliver a valuable product or service for the market. These include functions such as inbound logistics, operations, outbound logistics, marketing and sales, and service, supported by systems and technology infrastructure. By aligning the various activities in its value chain with the organization's strategy in a coherent way, a firm can achieve a competitive advantage. Porter also wrote that strategy is an internally consistent configuration <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> <b>that</b> differentiates a firm from its rivals. A robust competitive position cumulates from many activities which should fit coherently together.|$|E

25|$|Female-{{centered}} Rosh Chodesh observances {{vary from}} group to group, {{but many are}} centered on small gatherings of women, called Rosh Chodesh groups. There is often a particular interest in the Shekinah, considered by the kabbalah to be a feminine aspect of God. These groups engage {{in a wide variety}} <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> <b>that</b> center around issues important to Jewish women, depending on the preference of the group's members. Many Rosh Chodesh groups explore spirituality, religious education, ritual, health issues, music, chanting, art, and/or cooking. Some groups also choose to educate young Jewish women in their community about sexuality, self-image, and other women's mental and physical health issues.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} industries, which {{transform}} raw materials into final goods. These industries include a vinegar factory and a wood, and bamboo furniture and hut processing plant in barangay Santos, {{as well as}} rattan shop in Barucboc. Another major observation that {{can be obtained from}} the distribution of business enterprises in the municipality is the presence <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> <b>that</b> caters {{to the needs of the}} agricultural sector or the personal needs and requirements of residents. For instance, there are four business activities concentrated in barangay Arellano, which supply agricultural equipment from nearby municipalities such as Mallig and Roxas. This condition is brought about by the fact that some farmers especially in barangays quite distant from the Poblacion such as Turod and Barucboc have accessibility problems. It was learned also that some business establishments in nearby municipalities provide financial assistance to these farmers, which make farmers gravitate toward these other centers. To cater to the personal needs of the local residents, there are a number of business activities, which provide such services as photo supplies, beauty parlors and video rentals.|$|E
25|$|Social {{motivation}} {{is tied to}} one's activity in a group. It cannot form from a single mind alone. For example, bowling alone is naught but the dull act of throwing a ball into pins, and so people are {{much less likely to}} smile during the activity alone, even upon getting a strike because their satisfaction or dissatisfaction {{does not need to be}} communicated, and so it is internalized. However, when with a group, people are more inclined to smile regardless of their results because it acts as a positive communication that is beneficial for pleasurable interaction and teamwork. Thus the act of bowling becomes a social activity as opposed to a dull action because it becomes an exercise in interaction, competition, team building, and sportsmanship. It is because of this phenomenon that studies have shown that people are more intrigued in performing mundane activities so long as there is company because it provides the opportunity to interact in one way or another, be it for bonding, amusement, collaboration, or alternative perspectives. Examples <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> <b>that</b> may one may not be motivated to do alone but could be done with others for social benefit are things such as throwing and catching a baseball with a friend, making funny faces with children, building a treehouse, and performing a debate.|$|E

500|$|Harald himself {{composed}} skaldic poetry. According to Lee M. Hollander, composing poetry {{was normal}} for Norwegian kings, but Harald {{was the only}} one who [...] "showed a decided talent." [...] According to one poem, Harald had mastered a number <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> <b>that</b> were considered sports in the Viking Age, in addition to poetry, brewing, horse riding, swimming, skiing, shooting, rowing and playing the harp. The sagas state that Harald and his Varangians at least once took a break during the siege of a town to enjoy sports.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the breadth}} of Pedro's instruction, his {{education}} proved lacking. Historian Otávio Tarquínio de Sousa said that Pedro [...] "was without a shadow of doubt intelligent, quick-witted, [...] perspicacious." [...] However, historian Roderick J. Barman relates that he was by nature [...] "too ebullient, too erratic, and too emotional". He remained impulsive and never learned to exercise self-control or to assess {{the consequences of his}} decisions and adapt his outlook to changes in situations. His father never allowed anyone to discipline him. While Pedro's schedule dictated two hours of study each day, he sometimes circumvented the routine by dismissing his instructors in favor <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> <b>that</b> he found more interesting.|$|E
500|$|In {{the eighteenth}} century, estate houses were {{designed}} as centres of public display, {{but in the}} nineteenth century they became increasingly private. The first family wing in Britain was added to Blairquhan Castle in Ayrshire in 1820 by architect William Burn and the style became characteristic of the Victorian country house. From the 1830s distinct male areas of the house began to emerge, to which the men could withdraw and indulge in [...] "masculine" [...] conversation and activities, centred on the smoking and billiard rooms. From the 1870s gun rooms began to be added, mainly to cater for weapons for hunting weekends. The popularity of salmon fishing, deer stalking and grouse shooting, particularly in the Highlands, was confirmed by Queen Victoria's purchase of the hunting lodge at Balmoral. It rapidly expanded as southern industrialists and businessmen began to see the sports offered by Scottish estates as a status symbol. Large areas of land were designated for hunting and hunting parties became {{a major part of the}} life of the Scottish estate house. There were also a wider range <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> <b>that</b> developed {{in the nineteenth century}} for members of the leisured classes, such as croquet, lawn tennis, billiards, carriage rides, charades and amateur dramatics.|$|E
