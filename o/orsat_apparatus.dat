40|$|AbstractPhotosynthetic pigments, {{including}} chlorophyll, have {{an important}} role since they provide the oxygen and the source of energy for all living things. Plant and algae growth is affected by the photosynthesis speed which depends on the availability of carbon dioxide (CO 2). This paper reports on the pilot plant scale study of the impact of 20 % to 50 % CO 2 on biogas into the growing medium of microalgae which obtained bio-methane purification results as gaseous bio-fuels. Research material was produced from the Jatropha curcas Linn. husk biogas digester and a 0. 15 m 3 HDPE drum was used as a purification. The purification tank was filled with Catfish (Clarias gariepinus) farm water which grew “wild” microalgae naturally. The water was fed from the top with continuous flow of (16 to 31) L· min– 1 and the biogas was fed from the bottom at (18 to 29) L · min– 1. CO 2 level data of biogas was measured by <b>orsat</b> <b>apparatus</b> and processed with t test. The results achieved average efficiency reduction levels of CO 2 on 50 % in two cycles (24 % in the first and 26 % in the second) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{review of}} the {{available}} literature indicated that cognition {{of the behavior of}} jets normal to a moving stream was lacking. The object of this investigation was therefore To study the problem reduced to its simplest form; that of a two-dimensional jet normal to a moving stream. To determine the feasibility of the proposed measuring techniques. It was not intended that the results of this work necessarily have an immediate direct application. Rather it was to lay the foundation for future work along the same lines but with more complex situations should the techniques prove satisfactory. With reference to the study of a two-dimensional jet normal to a moving stream, and for the limited number of variables involved, it may be stated The penetration of a two-dimensional jet normal to a moving stream {{is a function of the}} jet density and velocity, the moving stream density and velocity, the distance downstream of the jet and the diameter of an equivalent area circle. The diffusion of a two-dimensional jet normal to a moving stream depends on the distance from the wall containing the jet orifice, the distance downstream of the jet, the jet velocity and the moving stream velocity. With reference to the feasibility of the proposed measuring techniques, it may be stated The use of carbon dioxide for the jet, the withdrawal of samples with a single small probe and the analysis of the samples with an <b>orsat</b> <b>apparatus</b> is feasible. The different densities of the gases produce very good schlieren and shadow photographs. Advisor:J. M. F. Vicker...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to find a}} means of obtaining undiluted exhaust-gas samples from a Wright R- 2600 -B aircraft engine equipped with short individual stacks (approximately 10 in. long). Preliminary tests to aid in determining the best design, location, and orientation of orifices ranging from a 0. 002 -inch slot to an 0. 1875 -inch-diameter circular opening {{at the entrance to}} an exhaust sampling tube were made with a small Briggs & Stratton engine. Sampling tubes 1 / 4 inch in diameter and with a 0. 010 -inch-slot orifice were installed in all 14 cylinders of the Wright engine after the correct location and orientation for the sampling tubes had been determined in tests on a single cylinder of this engine. Samples were analyzed by an <b>Orsat</b> portable <b>apparatus</b> and by an NACA mixture indicator. Prepared at the Aircraft Engine Research Laboratory, Cleveland, Ohio.
