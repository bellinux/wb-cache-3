5|$|The {{third and}} final Part lists some of Kennedy's reservations. He would not say that the {{defendant}} must be present at all stages of the trial. There should be a reluctance to consider the applicability of Article 75 of Protocol I, since the U.S. never signed it and thus it is not binding. Kennedy writes that he feels {{it was not necessary}} to delve into the validity of the conspiracy charge, and he expresses no view on the merits of the <b>other</b> <b>limitations</b> of the commission noted in Part V of the Decision.|$|E
5|$|Windows RT was {{released}} to mixed reviews from various outlets and critics. Some felt that Windows RT devices had advantages over other mobile platforms (such as iOS or Android) {{because of its}} bundled software {{and the ability to}} use a wider variety of USB peripherals and accessories, but the platform was criticized for its poor software ecosystem, citing the early state of Windows Store and its incompatibility with existing Windows software, and <b>other</b> <b>limitations</b> over Windows 8.|$|E

5|$|The QF 25-pounder Short {{received}} a mixed reception from gunners, and was particularly unpopular {{among members of}} AIF artillery units which had used the standard 25-pounder during the fighting in the Middle East. Guns were sometimes put out of action by damage caused by the absorption of violent recoil. The gun also {{had a tendency to}} tilt at low elevation; this was remedied by its crew standing on the trails, an expedient that had previously been used with the QF 4.5 inch Howitzer. <b>Other</b> <b>limitations</b> included a low rate of fire (three or four rounds per minute) and difficulties towing the weapon. Concerns were also raised over the quality of workmanship, and the commander of the 2/4th Field Regiment rejected a batch of Short 25-pounders sent to his unit before the Nadzab operation in the belief that they had been poorly manufactured. Inspectors subsequently concluded that most of his criticisms were unfounded, however. The most important deficiency compared to the regular 25-pounder was the shorter range. As a result of its experience with the gun, the 9th Division recommended that they be pooled and reserved for their special role rather than be employed in a day-to-day role alongside the regular 25 pounder.|$|E

25|$|Role-playing {{games of}} the 1970s and 1980s, such as Dungeons & Dragons, {{generally}} used random numbers generated by dice rolls to assign statistics to player characters.

25|$|Aside {{from having}} to deal with Russian {{political}} interference, Njegoš faced several <b>other</b> <b>limitations</b> to his power. He had no army, militia or police force to enforce the rule of law within the territory he nominally controlled and had to rely on warriors from his own clan for protection. The tribes on the Montenegrin frontier often either refused to obey him or befriended his enemies. Tribal raids, which drove deep into Ottoman-held Herzegovina, occurred frequently and looting proved key to the region's economic survival. Though such raids normally elicited a harsh response from the Ottomans, Njegoš was powerless to stop them.|$|E
25|$|Physical {{abuse is}} that {{involving}} contact intended to cause fear, pain, injury, other physical suffering or bodily harm. The dynamics of physical abuse {{in a relationship}} are often complex. Physical violence can be the culmination of other abusive behavior, such as threats, intimidation, and restriction of victim self-determination through isolation, manipulation and <b>other</b> <b>limitations</b> of personal freedom. Denying medical care, sleep deprivation, and forced drug or alcohol use, are also forms of physical abuse. It can also include inflicting physical injury onto other targets, such as children or pets, in order to cause emotional harm to the victim.|$|E
25|$|Compact (SQL CE): The compact edition is an {{embedded}} database engine. Unlike the other editions of SQL Server, the SQL CE engine {{is based on}} SQL Mobile (initially designed for use with hand-held devices) and does not share the same binaries. Due to its small size (1MB DLL footprint), it has a markedly reduced feature set {{compared to the other}} editions. For example, it supports a subset of the standard data types, does not support stored procedures or Views or multiple-statement batches (among <b>other</b> <b>limitations).</b> It is limited to 4GB maximum database size and cannot be run as a Windows service, Compact Edition must be hosted by the application using it. The 3.5 version includes support for ADO.NET Synchronization Services. SQL CE does not support ODBC connectivity, unlike SQL Server proper.|$|E

25|$|Also {{under the}} Piapro brand is Crypton's Piapro Studio, a Vocaloid vocal editor {{implemented}} as a VST/AU plugin bundled {{with all of}} their full V3 Vocaloid products (Miku V3, Miku V3 English, Miku V3 Bundle, Meiko V3, Kaito V3). This allows for full vocal editing functionality nearly identical in feature support to Yamaha's full Vocaloid 3 Editor software, which is available as either a standalone application or a plugin for Cubase. All Vocaloid 3 voice libraries include the Tiny Vocaloid 3 Editor for free, however this is quite severely limited in functionality compared to the full V3 editor, being limited to just 17 bars of output, along with some <b>other</b> <b>limitations</b> - serving mainly as a beginner's taste of Vocaloid editing or a way to easily test out a new vocal library. Piapro Studio was created to allow owners of Crypton's V3 products to have a fully featured vocal editor with a modernized and streamlined interface bundled free of charge. It also allows for the loading of 3rd-party, non-Crypton Vocaloid 3 voicebanks - as well as V2's that have been imported into the full V3 editor beforehand. Being a VST plugin, it allows the user to operate entirely within their DAW of choice, {{in contrast to the}} tiny or full V3 editors which are standalone applications and the user must export a wav to import into their DAW each time a change or update is needed - or export an updated wav file from their DAW as the background music to import into the V3 editor. This integration of the vocal editing within the DAW as a VST instrument plugin allows for convenient editing and a smoother workflow. Currently Piapro Studio is lacking some features of the full V3 editor, but most of these are not needed to work with the vocal composition and tuning of the Vocaloid, instead currently some convenience and expansion features such as WAV import and Vocaloid 3's Job Plugins (a scripting system), are absent from Piapro Studio. Crypton has however has mentioned they would like to implement something similar to Job Plugins {{at some point in the}} future. Piapro Studio is also regularly updated every few months with new features and bug fixes. Vocaloid 3 Editor updates appear much less frequently, generally only around the time of release of a new Vocaloid. Piapro Studio also features some Piapro social designed singer icons and vocal preview samples, added in an update in the Summer of 2014.|$|E
500|$|The {{team found}} {{difficulty}} porting {{the game to}} the Atari ST, due to the hardware's limitations with smooth scrolling. Brian [...] "Biscuit" [...] Watson, who the team met at a computer club in 1984, discovered a technique to overcome this difficulty. <b>Other</b> <b>limitations</b> included the fewer colours available with the hardware; Smith adapted his designs accordingly. After completing his own game, Kay was assigned to port Menace to PC. During development, the sound effects were temporarily replaced with those from Salamander (1986); Jones recorded the sound effects from the game, as Hammond and Dailly played. Prior to this, the temporary sound effects consisted of noises by Jones. The game's final sound effects were designed by musician David Whittaker. The cover art was designed by Ian Craig.|$|E

To help save the company, the employees offered to work for half wage, but it was not sufficient to save the line. All scheduled traffic was terminated on 23 October 1932, although the section to Tronstad Bruk was retained for some industrial trains until 31 December 1936. The line was then demolished.|$|E
