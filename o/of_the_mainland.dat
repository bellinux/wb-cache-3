5|$|In 1959, David Harrison {{described}} a small Miniopterus {{from the island}} of Grande Comore as a subspecies, Miniopterus minor griveaudi, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainland</b> African species M.minor. The name griveaudi honors Paul Griveaud, who collected the specimens on which Harrison based his description. This classification remained {{for the next few}} decades; in 1992, for example, Javier Juste and Carlos Ibáñez recognized five subspecies, including griveaudi, within M.minor, ranging from São Tomé to Madagascar. In their 1995 review of Madagascar bats, Randolph Peterson and colleagues recognized the small Malagasy Miniopterus as a separate species, Miniopterus manavi, with griveaudi as a subspecies.|$|E
5|$|Miniopterus griveaudi is a bat in {{the genus}} Miniopterus found on Grande Comore and Anjouan in the Comoros and in {{northern}} and western Madagascar. First described in 1959 from Grande Comore as a subspecies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainland</b> African M.minor, {{it was later}} placed with the Malagasy M.manavi. However, morphological and molecular studies published in 2008 and 2009 indicated that M.manavi as then defined contained five distinct, unrelated species, and M.griveaudi was redefined as a species occurring on both Madagascar and the Comoros.|$|E

Marble Hill {{at one time}} was part of Manhattan Island, but the Harlem River Ship Canal, dug in 1895 to improve navigation on the Harlem River, separated it from the remainder of Manhattan as an island between the Bronx and the remainder of Manhattan. Before World War I, {{the section of the}} original Harlem River channel separating Marble Hill from The Bronx was filled in, and Marble Hill became part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainland.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Baroque {{style in}} Sicily was largely {{confined}} to buildings erected by the church, and palazzi built as private residences for the Sicilian aristocracy. The earliest {{examples of this}} style in Sicily lacked individuality and were typically heavy-handed pastiches of buildings seen by Sicilian visitors to Rome, Florence, and Naples. However, even at this early stage, provincial architects had begun to incorporate certain vernacular features of Sicily's older architecture. By {{the middle of the}} 18th century, when Sicily's Baroque architecture was noticeably different from that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainland,</b> it typically included {{at least two or three}} of the following features, coupled with a unique freedom of design that is more difficult to characterise in words.|$|E
5|$|The LRDG {{returned}} to Yugoslavia in February 1945, operating around Istria and Dalmatia, where Germany still held portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainland</b> and certain strategic islands.

The LRDG was tasked to patrol the coast, find the ships and report their locations {{to the air force}} for bombing. This it did with success. It remained in Yugoslavia {{for the rest of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|The Mainland is {{the largest}} island of Orkney.

The island is more densely populated (75% of Orkney's population) than the other islands and has much fertile farmland. The Mainland is split into areas called East and West Mainland.

The bulk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainland</b> lies West of Kirkwall, with comparatively little land lying East of Kirkwall.|$|E

5|$|The {{flora and}} fauna of Stroma {{are similar to those}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainland.</b> The island is treeless; its {{vegetation}} consists primarily of grasses, heather and small flowers. Seals are plentiful along its shores and are sometimes found inland during the breeding season. Both grey seals and harbour seals are present, with around 650 grey seal pups being born each year. Otters may also be present, as in other parts of mainland Caithness. The western cliffs are the site of colonies of terns, guillemots, fulmars and eider ducks. The cliffs are designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest within the North Caithness Cliffs Special Protection Area. The waters off Stroma support a number of cetacean species including minke whale, white-beaked dolphin and harbour porpoise.|$|E
5|$|The islands {{all fall}} within the Shetland Islands Council local authority. They have been {{continuously}} inhabited since Neolithic times and experienced Norse rule for several centuries, the first written records being the Norse sagas. The excavations at Jarlshof near the southern end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mainland</b> have provided archaeological evidence of life in Shetland since Bronze Age times and the annual Up Helly Aa fire festivals are a living reminder of Shetland's Viking past. The archipelago is exposed to wind and tide and there are numerous lighthouses {{as an aid to}} navigation. A small wind farm on Shetland recently achieved a world record of 58% capacity {{over the course of a}} year. The indigenous Shetland ponies are reputed for their strength and hardiness.|$|E
5|$|Unable {{to defeat}} Agesilaus' army, Pharnabazus decided to force Agesilaus to {{withdraw}} by stirring up {{trouble on the}} Greek mainland.

Timocrates visited Athens, Thebes, Corinth, and Argos, and succeeded in persuading powerful factions {{in each of those}} states to pursue an anti-Spartan policy.
