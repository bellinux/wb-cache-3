5|$|The long, rectilinear, two-storey building, had {{a double}} {{cantilevered}} frame supported {{on a single}} row of concrete columns. These columns tilted outwards from a vertical position. Floor to ceiling glazing on the second storey opened <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>a</b> balcony running {{the length of the}} building. It included technical innovations from America including acoustic ceiling tiles, underfloor electricity ducts and fluorescent lighting.|$|E
5|$|She {{then moves}} <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>a</b> dock, where she meets Ben Linus. Juliet is shown {{operating}} with Ethan and Goodwin (Brett Cullen) on a pregnant patient, Sabine, who dies; she is comforted by Goodwin. Juliet meets with Ben, and explains her {{theory that the}} problems with pregnant women happen at conception. She wants to test this theory by having a woman conceive off the island, but Ben refuses to let anyone off the island. When Juliet tells him that nothing else can be done and asks {{to go home and}} be with her sister, Ben informs Juliet that her sister's cancer has come back. He offers her a choice: either Juliet can go home and be with her sister as she dies, or she can stay and he will have Jacob cure her sister's cancer.|$|E
5|$|The temple shrine {{was built}} on a final {{platform}} {{on top of the}} fourth tier. The exposed remains of the shrine date to the reign of Oxlahuh-Tz'i'. It had a triple doorway divided by columns and was built from adobe covered with plaster, the columns and walls on eithers side of the doorways were painted with decorations, traces of red, yellow and blue were found by archaeologists, these colours were applied to designs marked <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>a</b> thin cap of clay with a pointed instrument. The quality of the work was very fine and indicated execution by a specialised artist. There were ten painted figures {{on the front of the}} building with further murals on the back. The designs consist of two rows of discs on top of a row of vertical stripes with figures painted against the striped background with the discs above them. The painted figures are performing various actions, one of which is tongue piercing, and they probably represent a Kaqchikel ritual in progress. The painted murals are very poorly preserved due to deterioration caused by damp combined with damage caused by tree roots. The style of the paintings is very similar to that of Postclassic Mixtec art. Exposed parts of the middle phase of construction were damaged and the second phase was covered by the final construction phase, which was badly damaged by the stonework being stripped away for building the nearby town of Tecpán.|$|E

50|$|Excursion {{trail to}} the {{strawberry}} field or Pampa de la Frutilla, is 12.4 miles long, and takes between 2 or 3 days round trip. It starts at the 1.8 mile marker of Anticuar. An old road continues from the Último Puesto area, and then crosses the forest until it stretches <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>an</b> Andean prairie. In the Seca Lagoon (Laguna Seca) there’s a rustic shelter.|$|R
50|$|The exteriors for Alice Leacock's {{house were}} filmed at the James Sharp House, 11840 W. Telegraph Rd, Santa Paula, California. The house is an {{historical}} Italian Villa style home built in 1890. In reality, {{it does not}} back <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>an</b> oceanside cliff as depicted in the movie. Instead, it backs <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> the Santa Paula Freeway, {{about a quarter of}} a mile behind the house. For a second, you can see the tower of the house in the distance while driving on the Freeway.|$|R
25|$|Murphy {{opened a}} second Florida {{restaurant}} in Deerfield Beach, Fla. around 1970. As in Fort Lauderdale, the Deerfield Beach Candlelight included gardens. An artificial brook flowed through the dining room, and the bar’s tall plexiglass windows looked <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>a</b> moat.|$|E
25|$|Giving the longe: briefly {{releasing}} the line towards the horse's head, before re-establishing contact. Acts as a reward, asks {{the horse to}} lower its head, or asks the horse to move <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>a</b> larger circle. The line should not drag or become very loose when this is performed.|$|E
25|$|Justine's boss's nephew, Tim, {{is given}} the chance to exploit the {{opportunity}} to get the tag line at all costs to promote his career, a task similar to what Justine was previously so successful at. He reluctantly, but doggedly, pursues Justine throughout the wedding reception. She cannot consummate her marriage with her husband and goes <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>a</b> sand trap and has sex with Tim. Tim is later fired for his failure, and Justine aggressively resigns. Justine and Michael talk and decide that their marriage was a failure. Michael departs. Early the following morning, while horseback riding with Claire, Justine notices Antares is no longer visible in the sky.|$|E
25|$|La Femme aux Phlox is an oil {{on canvas}} with {{dimensions}} 81 x 100cm (31 by 39 inches) signed and dated 'Alb Gleizes 10'. Created {{during the second half}} of 1910, the painting represents a woman sitting in an interior setting, with a vase of flowers (phloxes) in front and another to her left. The window behind the sitter opens <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>an</b> exterior scene, the whole blurring the distinction between interior and exterior.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} {{is a list of}} the arenas and the performers as listed in the official programme. All of the arenas were inside large tents apart from the Radio 1 Beach arena, which had an outdoor stage looking <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>an</b> area that had been covered in sand. The Get Loaded/Godskitchen tent held an estimated 15,000 people. It is worth noting that not all acts came on at the exact times listed in the programme.|$|R
50|$|The maned owl {{is not at}} well known. It is nocturnal, {{roosting}} by day {{in dense}} creepers {{as close to the}} ground as 2 m, emerging <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>an</b> open perch at dusk. Their diet is not well understood, but small and weak feet and claws suggest that insects such as grasshoppers and beetles form the largest part of its diet. Green plant material has been found in the stomach contents of a young owl.|$|R
25|$|The album {{features}} various {{scenes of}} The White Family {{over the course}} of three days. The family is devoured while watching a TV game show. Valerie, the girlfriend of hot-shot television reporter Bruce is devoured by three massive maggots while lying in her boyfriend's bed. The final scene has Cindy White trying to fight off the attacking maggots and running <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>a</b> fire escape where she sees the crowded streets below as the record shows the entire human population is headed for imminent annihilation. The album was on the WOW label; distributed by Profile Records in the U.S. and overseas by GWR Records, which had been started by Motörhead's longtime manager Doug Smith.|$|E
25|$|In Italy, a {{significant}} building {{of this time}} is the 12th- or 13th-century Rector’s Palace in San Gimignano. This modestly sized building, fronting onto a square, has a symmetrical façade, a low gable that retains {{the appearance of a}} Classical pediment, and a portal that has a semi-circular arch raised above a broad lintel supported on corbels, a common feature of medieval Italian domestic architecture and also seen at the House of Dante. This house has a doorway, also with arch and lintel, between the two mullioned windows of its upper floor that once led <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>a</b> balcony, like the one that has been restored on a 13th-century house at Poreč in Istria, Croatia.|$|E
500|$|Later, in Tokyo, Japan, Wesker, who is {{the head}} of the Tokyo Umbrella {{facility}}, informs the rest of the Umbrella chairmen (all holograms) that the North American facility has been lost. Alice's hologram makes an appearance, declaring that she is coming for him, and she's bringing some of her [...] "friends." [...] Standing beside her clone, Alice looks <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>a</b> huge number of pods containing her developing clones.|$|E
25|$|In the foyer, to {{the right}} of the door leading to the library, was a set of plain marble stairs with an {{intermediate}} landing and single turn which lead to the third floor. Behind the steps was a conservatory with a bay window facing northwest. From the intermediate landing, a door in the northeast wall gave <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>an</b> orchestra balcony overlooking the ballroom. The base of the balcony is decorated with corbels, plaster drapery, and guttae.|$|R
50|$|The {{railroad}} ran south down First Street in Ilwaco, {{and then}} <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> to <b>a</b> dock in Baker's Bay. Floating logs were stored behind log booms {{on the west}} side of the Ilwaco dock.|$|R
5000|$|Mel Brooks's 1974 comedy Blazing Saddles leaves its Western setting {{when the}} climactic fight scene breaks out, {{revealing}} the setting {{to have been}} a set in the Warner Bros. studio lot; the fight spills <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>an</b> adjacent musical set, then into the studio canteen, and finally onto the streets. The two protagonists arrive at Grauman's Chinese Theater, which is showing the [...] "premiere" [...] of Blazing Saddles; they enter the cinema to watch the conclusion of their own film.|$|R
500|$|The drill removes {{an annulus}} of ice around the core {{but does not}} cut under it. A {{spring-loaded}} lever arm called a core dog can break off the core and hold it in place while it is brought to the surface. [...] The core is then extracted from the drill barrel, usually by laying it out flat so that the core can slide <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>a</b> prepared surface. [...] The core must be cleaned of drilling fluid as it is slid out; for the WAIS Divide coring project, a vacuuming system {{was set up to}} facilitate this. [...] The surface that receives the core should be aligned as accurately as possible with the drill barrel to minimise mechanical stress on the core, which can easily break. [...] The ambient temperature is kept well below freezing to avoid thermal shock.|$|E
2500|$|Passengers {{bound for}} Newport, Agate Beach, Otter Rocks, Seal Rocks, Waldport, Tidewater and Yachats would arrive by rail at Yaquina City, Oregon. [...] Baggage and cargo would be {{transferred}} from the train to the steamer by the train pulling <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>a</b> pier and the baggage then being sent down a chute onto the steamer.|$|E
2500|$|Flood locks {{which have}} been used only as flood gates (see below) are often {{incapable}} of reverting to their former purpose without refurbishment. That is, where only outer gates are ever closed (probably because a waterway is not a true commercial one, and therefore there is no financial imperative for a boat to venture <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>a</b> flooded river) inner gates soon suffer from lack of maintenance. A good example is on the Calder and Hebble Navigation, where structures {{referred to in the}} boating guides as [...] "Flood Locks" [...] are clearly only capable of being used for flood-prevention, not for [...] "penning" [...] boats to or from the river in flood.|$|E

One?s life, assumed to be finite, ticking away. Night covers things up but you can still hear the rain. [URL]...|$|R
50|$|A single {{large window}} sits {{on either side}} of the {{entrance}} bay on both floors. The ground floor windows are semi-circular in shape, timber framed with a decorative masonry detail around the edge. The left hand window is unaltered, with the centre leaf a casement window that open outwards, while the right hand window has been altered to contain a glass-paned door opening <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>an</b> enclosed area (a recent fence around this enclosed area is not considered to be of cultural heritage significance). The upper floor has cantilevered bay windows with flared chamferboard skirtings. Each one has four six-light casements.|$|R

2500|$|Dinas Brân is {{basically}} a rectangular castle with the longer sides running east-west. Beyond the northern wall the steep natural slope falls sharply several hundred feet whilst the southern and eastern walls are defended by a 20 feet deep ditch. At the south eastern corner where the ditch is at its deepest stands the Keep which looks <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>a</b> relatively easy approach to the castle from the River Dee. The two-storey Keep {{would have been the}} strongest part of the castle with its own defended approach through a narrow passage. Next to the Keep at the north eastern corner is the gatehouse which was originally approached by a wooden bridge spanning the ditch. There is however almost no evidence remaining of the bridge and its supporting structure so that the exact configuration remains unclear. The bridge was also overlooked by the Keep which allowed archers stationed there to guard the entrance. The Gatehouse had two towers either side of a decorated covered passageway into the castle courtyard.|$|E
2500|$|The route {{continues}} {{into the}} small hamlet, one of many communities located along Ridge Road. NY14 joins the old road for one block westward before leaving Alton to the north. From Ridge Road north to Lake Road in Sodus Point, NY14 {{is part of the}} Seaway Trail, a National Scenic Byway. This stretch of NY14 heads due north across cultivated fields for [...] before curving to the northwest to avoid Sodus Bay. At this point, the farmlands are gradually replaced by waterside homes and communities as NY14 closes in on the bay's shoreline. It reaches the water's edge as it enters Sodus Point, where it initially follows South Fitzhugh Street. At Lake Road, the Seaway Trail heads west to follow the southern edge of Lake Ontario while NY14 turns east onto Bay Street. After three blocks, Bay Street gives way to Greig Street, a dead-end street leading <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>a</b> peninsula protruding into the mouth of Sodus Bay. The street and the route both end in a cul-de-sac at the east end of the peninsula.|$|E
60|$|It took Harris {{several minutes}} to find Westerburg. The youth {{was not with}} the other patients, near or around the bridge. He had gone farther down, past the cedar trees and <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>a</b> strip of bright meadow, where poppies and grass grew everywhere. He {{was sitting on the}} stream bank, on a flat grey stone, leaning back and staring up, his mouth open a little. He did not notice the Doctor until Harris was almost beside him.|$|E
50|$|Abgar II (ruled 68 - 53 BC) was a Syriac king of Edessa in Osroene (today part {{of eastern}} Turkey). In 64 BC, he {{sided with the}} Romans helping Pompey's legate Lucius Afranius when the latter {{occupied}} northern Mesopotamia, but it is alleged that he helped to betray Marcus Crassus by leading him <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>an</b> open plain, resulting in 53 BC in the Battle of Carrhae, which destroyed an entire Roman army. What is certain is that he gained no benefits from the battle, since shortly after he was deposed by Orodes II in a move to strengthen Parthian control over the region.|$|R
50|$|It {{appears from}} {{excavations}} in 1970 that the Palace {{also had a}} huge underground wine cellar, situated under the present-day gymnasium; this cellar {{is thought to have}} been built around 1291-92 and was located {{on the west side of}} a kitchen court, opposite a bakehouse. Excavations also revealed the presence of a structure to the east of this which is thought to be a probable gatehouse. This gatehouse opened <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>an</b> approach road, now known as Langley Hill. Because the kitchens were located on the west side of the site, it is thought that the great hall of the palace ran on an east-west alignment.|$|R
50|$|The album artwork for Ghost Stories was etched by British-based Czech etching artist Mila Fürstová. The medieval art-driven artwork, {{measuring}} 100 by 100 cm, {{features a}} pair of angel wings imposed <b>onto</b> <b>a</b> painting of an ocean under a sky at night. The angel wings themselves feature cryptic imagery of medieval-style drawings of fairly contemporary objects and concepts. The images include a couple in love, a man facing a mirror, a flight of white doves, a circular maze, a girl by candlelight, <b>a</b> window looking <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>an</b> incoming tornado and a garden plant with a ladder, amongst other imagery depicted in the artwork. A larger, digital version of the artwork is available on Coldplay's official website, {{with the ability to}} zoom into the artwork with a screen magnifier.|$|R
60|$|Luke and Mr. Dobson {{were even}} now {{making their way}} to the same group of seats. They had--like the jury and the coroner--been in the {{mortuary}} to have a last look at the murdered man. Louisa thought that Luke looked years older than he had done yesterday. She saw him standing for a moment right against the dull, drabby background of the court room wall; and it seemed as if something of that drabbiness had descended upon his soul. Youth seemed to have gone out of him. He appeared to be looking <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>a</b> dreary world through windows obscured by grime.|$|E
60|$|The room {{which he}} had entered was airy but small, so small, indeed, that the {{presence}} of any furniture in it at all was almost miraculous, for at first sight it seemed incredible that the bed did not fill it from side to side. There were however, a few vacant spots, and in these had been placed a wash-stand, a chest of drawers, and a midget rocking-chair. The window, which the thoughtful architect had designed at least three sizes too large for the room and which admitted the evening air in pleasing profusion, looked <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>a</b> series of forlorn back-yards. In boarding-houses, it is only the windows of the rich and haughty that face the street.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Crocker's den was a {{small room}} {{at the back of}} the house. It was not luxurious, and it looked <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>a</b> blank wall, but it was the spot he liked best in all that vast pile which had once echoed to the tread of titled shoes; for, as he {{sometimes}} observed to his son, it had the distinction of being the only room on the ground floor where a fellow could move without stubbing his toe on a countess or an honourable. In this peaceful backwater he could smoke a pipe, put his feet up, take off his coat, and generally indulge in that liberty and pursuit of happiness to which the Constitution entitles a free-born American. Nobody ever came there except Jimmy and himself.|$|E
50|$|On {{an early}} August morning in Harney County, Florida, fanatic bass {{fisherman}} Robert Clinch takes his bass boat <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> the lake. <b>A</b> few hours later, he is found floating dead {{in that same}} lake.|$|R
50|$|Some of {{his most}} {{remarkable}} works are constructions which he titled IMOOS (Images Moving <b>Out</b> <b>Onto</b> Space).
