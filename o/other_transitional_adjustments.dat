40|$|We {{introduce}} a renewable resource sector into an endogenous growth {{model of a}} small economy, deriving the transitional dynamic equilibrium. The model generates a long-run balanced growth path along which a resource sector of limited size can coexist with constant ongoing growth elsewhere. The key feature of the model is the allocation of labor between harvesting the resource and its use in the final output sector. We examine both the dynamic and long-run responses of the economy to various shocks pertaining to technological production conditions and resource sector parameters and show how they can generate sharply contrasting <b>transitional</b> <b>adjustment</b> paths. ...|$|R

30|$|There {{are many}} {{possible}} reasons why CEO may have lowered recidivism when <b>other</b> <b>transitional</b> jobs programs did not.

The study used quantitative methodology with Pre-test and Post-test surveys with open-ended feedback on cultural attitudes and cultural learning.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{adjustment}} policies on different {{groups in the}} population is an important and complex issue. The distributional implications can have a large influence on the sustainability of programs.

This assessment will be useful for developing compensation schemes for those groups that may be negatively affected in the <b>transitional</b> <b>adjustment</b> period, and in generating support for adjustment programs.

40|$|This book explores a {{relatively}} uncharted area of democratic transitions: the empirical study of intensely politicized transitional societies. In particular, it addresses {{the problems of}} protracted democratic transitions that occur when a one-party state has been incompletely dismantled. Due to an initially smooth political transition from one-party authoritarianism to multi-party politics, Taiwan’s gradual process of democratization has been celebrated {{as one of the}} most successful cases of political transformation. However, this political transition was not completed and, especially since 2000 when the first non-Kuomintang president was elected, Taiwan has been marked by protracted political struggles together with an intense politicization of  society that persists to this day. In Taiwan, rather than supporting democracy, many of the political practices associated with representative democracy, such as election campaigning, political demonstrations, vote mobilization and political debate in the media, can appear to undermine the future sustainability of democratic politics through the ways in which they are pursued. However, the book maintains that institutional flaws are not enough to explain the shortcomings of Taiwan’s democratic politics or those in <b>other</b> <b>transitional</b> democracies. The practices established before the political transition continue to affect politics after the transition. Thus, when an old dominant party like the Kuomintang continues to thrive even after the end of one-party rule, the process of political liberalization and transition contains within itself the seeds of structural politicization. As such, not only does this study have empirical value – warning that extreme politicization is the main internal threat to the sustainability of Taiwan’s democratic politics – but also its analysis is pertinent to the situations of many <b>other</b> <b>transitional</b> democracies around the world.  It will be of interest to scholars and students of Taiwanese, Mainland Chinese and East Asian politics, as well as to those concerned with political developments in <b>other</b> <b>transitional</b> societies...|$|R

Although globalization has increased the importance of technology and service sector jobs, it has also resulted in the loss of many manufacturing jobs as companies that cannot compete with lower-priced imports go out of business or relocate abroad. The federal government recognizes that although the benefits of increased trade are widely dispersed across the economy, the costs of worker dislocation effects are more localized. This has heightened concerns about the efficacy of federal trade adjustment assistance efforts. This testimony discusses (1) the nature of trade impacts on communities and the use of benefits and services under TAA and the NAFTA-TAA programs, (2) the structural problems that impede effective delivery of those services and benefits, and (3) the longer-term challenges facing trade-impacted communities. ...|$|R
