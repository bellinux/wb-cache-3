Other useful topics mentioned that patients and doctors might discuss include; carefully monitoring and managing activity to avoid worsening of symptoms, counseling to cope with the impact the illness may have on quality of life, proper nutrition and nutritional supplements that may support better health, complementary therapies that might help increase energy or decrease pain.|$|E
25|$|The second {{effect of}} {{weightlessness}} {{takes place in}} human fluids. The body {{is made up of}} 60% water, much of it intra-vascular and inter-cellular. Within a few moments of entering a microgravity environment, fluid is immediately re-distributed to the upper body resulting in bulging neck veins, puffy face and sinus and nasal congestion which can last throughout the duration of the trip and is very much like the symptoms of the common cold. In space the autonomic reactions of the body to maintain blood pressure are not required and fluid is distributed more widely around the whole body. This results in a decrease in plasma volume of around 20%. These fluid shifts initiate a cascade of adaptive systemic effects that can be dangerous upon return to earth. <b>Orthostatic</b> <b>intolerance</b> results in astronauts returning to Earth after extended space missions being unable to stand unassisted for more than 10 minutes at a time without fainting. This {{is due in part to}} changes in the autonomic regulation of blood pressure and the loss of plasma volume. Although this effect becomes worse the longer the time spent in space, as yet all individuals have returned to normal within at most a few weeks of landing.|$|E

To provide a basis for improving the understanding of the epidemiology, genotype/phenotype correlation, outcome of these diseases, their impact on {{the quality of life of}} patients, and for evaluating diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, a patient registry was established by the non-commercial International Working Group on Neurotransmitter Related Disorders (iNTD).|$|R
40|$|Cardiac {{autonomic}} neuropathy (CAN) represents aserious complication as {{it carries}} an approximatelyfive-fold risk of mortality {{in patients with}} diabetes just as in those with chronic liver diseases. The high mortality rate {{may be related to}} silent myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiovascular and cardiorespiratory instability and to other causes not yet explained. Resting tachycardia due to parasympathetic damage may represent one of the earliest signs. Typical findings referring to autonomic dysfunction may include exercise <b>intolerance,</b> <b>orthostatic</b> hypotension and cardiac dysfunction to rest or exercise. Severe autonomic neuropathy may be responsible for spontaneous respiratory arrest and unexplained sudden death. A relationship between the presence and/or severity of CAN and corrected QT interval prolongation is well documented. Better understanding of the prognostic importance of autonomic neuropathy followed the use of simple non-invasive cardiovascular reflex tests. These most commonly include heart rate variation in response to deep breathing, standing, the Valsalva maneouvre and blood pressure response to standing and sustained handgrip. Near normoglycaemia is now generally accepted as the primary approach to the prevention of diabetic neuropathy, but is not achievable in most patients. Our experience of the use of the antioxidant alpha-lipoic acid in the treatment of cardiac autonomic neuropathy is described...|$|R

2500|$|Adaptation to {{weightlessness}} involves {{not just}} the Sensory-motor coupling functions, but some autonomic nervous system functions as well. Sleep disorders and <b>orthostatic</b> <b>intolerance</b> are also common during and after spaceflight. There is no hydrostatic pressure in a weightless environment. As a result, the redistribution of body fluids toward the upper body causes a decrease in leg volume, which may affect muscle viscosity and compliance. An increase in intracranial pressure may also be responsible for a decrease in near visual acuity. In addition, muscle mass and strength both decrease {{as a result of}} the reduced loading in weightlessness. Moreover, approximately 70% of astronauts experience space motion sickness to some degree during the first days. [...] The drugs commonly used to combat motion sickness, such as scopolamine and promethazine, have soporific effects. These factors can lead to chronic fatigue. The challenge of integrative space medicine and physiology is to investigate the adaptation of the human body to spaceflight as a whole, and not just as the sum of body parts because all body functions are connected and interact with each other.|$|E
50|$|<b>Orthostatic</b> <b>intolerance</b> (OI) is the {{development}} of symptoms when standing upright which are relieved when reclining.

40|$|There {{is little}} {{evidence}} obtained from space flight to {{support the notion that}} occurrence of cardiac dysrhythmias, impaired cardiac and vascular function, and manifestation of asymptomatic cardiovascular disease represent serious risks during space flight. Therefore, the development of orthostatic hypotension and instability immediately after return from spaceflight probably reflect the most significant operational risks associated with the cardiovascular system of astronauts. Significant reductions in stroke volume and lower reserve for increasing peripheral vascular resistance contribute to ineffective maintenance of systemic arterial blood pressure during standing after spaceflight despite compensatory elevations in heart rate. The primary mechanism underlying reduced stroke volume appears to be a reduction in preload associated with less circulating blood volume while inadequate peripheral vasoconstriction may be caused partly by hyporeactivity of receptors that control arterial smooth muscle function. A focus for development of future countermeasures for hemodynamic responses to central hypovolemia includes the potential application of pharmacological agents that specifically target and restore blood volume (e. g., fludrocortisone, electrolyte-containing beverages) and reserve for vasoconstriction (e. g., midodrine, vasopressin). Based on systematic evaluations, acute physical exercise designed to elicit maximal effort or inspiratory resistance have shown promise as successful countermeasures that provide protection against development of <b>orthostatic</b> hypotension and <b>intolerance</b> without potential risks and side effects associated with specific pharmacological interventions...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{examined the}} interaction between carotid baroreflex (CBR) responsiveness during head-up tilt (HUT) -induced central hypovolaemia and aerobic fitness. Seven average fit (AF) individuals, with a mean maximal oxygen uptake () of 49 ± 1 (ml O 2) kg− 1 min− 1, and seven high fit (HF) individuals, with a of 61 ± 1 (ml O 2) kg− 1 min− 1, voluntarily participated in the investigation. After 10 – 15 min supine, each subject was exposed to nine levels of progressively increasing HUT by 10 deg increments from − 20 deg to + 60 deg. During the final 3 min of each stage of HUT, the CBR responsiveness was measured using a rapid pulse (500 ms) train of neck pressure (NP) and neck suction (NS) ranging from + 40 to − 80 Torr. The maximal gain of the carotid-HR (Gmax-HR) and carotid-MAP (Gmax-MAP) baroreflex function curves was identified as measures of CBR responsiveness. During HUT-induced decreases in thoracic admittance, an index of central blood volume (CBV), the Gmax-HR and Gmax-MAP of the AF subjects increased more than the Gmax-HR and Gmax-MAP of the HF subjects (P < 0. 05). The data demonstrate {{that the increase in}} the CBR responsiveness during a tilt-induced progressive unloading of the cardiopulmonary baroreceptors was attenuated in endurance-trained subjects. These findings provide an explanation for the predisposition to <b>orthostatic</b> hypotension and <b>intolerance</b> in well-trained athletes...|$|R
40|$|Decreased {{heart rate}} {{variability}} responses during early postoperative mobilization – an observational study Øivind Jans 1, 2 *, Louise Brinth 3, Henrik Kehlet 1, 2 and Jesper Mehlsen 3 Background: Intact orthostatic blood pressure regulation is essential for early mobilization after surgery. However, postoperative <b>orthostatic</b> hypotension and <b>intolerance</b> (OI) may delay early ambulation. The mechanisms of postoperative OI include impaired vasopressor responses relating to postoperative autonomic dysfunction. Thus, based on a previous study on haemodynamic responses during mobilization before and after elective total hip arthroplasty (THA), we performed secondary analyses of {{heart rate variability}} (HRV) and aimed to identify possible abnormal postoperative autonomic responses in relation to postural change. Methods: A standardized mobilization protocol before, 6 and 24 h after surgery was performed in 23 patients scheduled for elective THA. Beat-to-beat arterial blood pressure was measured by photoplethysmography and HRV was derived from pulse wave interbeat intervals and analysed in the time and frequency domain {{as well as by}} non-linear analysis using sample entropy Results: Before surgery, arterial pressures and HR increased upon standing, while HRV low (LF) and high frequency (HF) components remained unchanged. At 6 and 24 h after surgery, resting total HRV power, sample entropy and postural responses in arterial pressures decreased compared to preoperative conditions. During standing HF variation increased by 16. 7 (95 % CI 8. 0 – 25. 0) normalized units (nu) at 6 h and 10. 7 (2. 0 – 19. 4) nu at 24 h compared to the preoperative evaluation. At 24 h the LF/HF ratio decreased from 1. 8 (1. 2 – 2. 6) nu when supine to 1. 2 (0. 8 – 1. 8) nu when standing.

40|$|Weightlessness during spaceflight causes cephalad {{redistribution}} of intravascular and extravascular fluid, provoking cardiovascular and {{autonomic nervous system}} adaptations. The resulting functional state is appropriate for weightlessness but can result in <b>orthostatic</b> hypotension and <b>intolerance</b> during and after return to a persistent acceleration or gravitational environment. Lower body negative pressure (LBNP) applies subambient air pressure to the legs and lower abdomen inside a volume sealed at the waist, and decompression by 4050 mmHg reverses the spaceflightinduced cephalad shift. LBNP has been used both to test the state of cardiovascular system during spaceflight and as a countermeasure by all spacefaring nations. Two configurations have thus far been used in spaceflight since the first LBNP flew on the first Soviet Salyut station in 1971. The Soviet and Russian configuration, used in four Salyut stations, the Mir space station and the Russian segment of the International Space Station, has no saddle to support the body so during decompression the feet press against {{the bottom of the}} collapsible chamber which shortens and applies force against the feet proportional to the decompression level. Thus, activation of the skeletal musculature partially counteracts vascular and venous pooling in the enclosed body segments, stimulating the orthostatic compensatory mechanisms as they would be standing on Earth. In the American configuration, used aboard Skylab and the Space Shuttle, a saddle supported the astronaut so the feet did not contact the bottom of the chamber, and vascular engorgement was not countered by muscular contraction. This minimized skeletal muscle involvement, unmasked vascular compensatory mechanisms for research purposes, and allowed measurements of changes in leg volume and muscle sympathetic nerve activity. Both variants have demonstrated research and therapeutic value in appropriately designed protocols. LBNP continues to be used for research and countermeasures on ISS, and future versions may explore the value of exercise during LBNP as an integrated countermeasure. This paperwill review the history and development of LBNP for spaceflight research and therapeutic purposes...|$|R

50|$|A single-nucleotide {{polymorphism}} (SNP) is {{a genetic}} variation {{in which a}} genome sequence is altered by a single nucleotide (A, T, C or G). NET proteins with an altered amino acid sequence (more specifically, a missense mutation) could potentially be associated with various diseases that involve abnormally high or low plasma levels of norepinephrine due to altered NET function. NET SNPs and possible associations with various diseases are an area of focus for many research projects. There is evidence suggesting a relationship between NET SNPs and various disorders such as ADHD psychiatric disorders, postural tachycardia and <b>orthostatic</b> <b>intolerance.</b> The SNPs rs3785143 and rs11568324 have been related to attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.

50|$|<b>Orthostatic</b> <b>intolerance</b> (OI) is a {{disorder}} of the {{autonomic nervous system}} (a subcategory of dysautonomia) characterized by the onset of symptoms upon standing. Symptoms include fatigue, lightheadedness, headache, weakness, increased heart rate/heart palpitations, anxiety, and altered vision. Often, patients have high plasma norepinephrine (NE) concentrations (at least 600 pg/ml) in relation to sympathetic outflow upon standing, suggesting OI is a hyperadrenergic condition.The discovery of identical twin sisters both suffering from OI suggested a genetic basis for the disorder. A missense mutation on the NET gene (SLC6A2) was discovered in which an alanine residue was replaced with a proline residue (Ala457Pro) in a highly conserved region of the transporter. The patients’ defective NET had only 2% of {{the activity of the}} wild-type version of the gene. The genetic defect in the NET protein results in decreased NET activity that could account for abnormally high NE plasma levels in OI. However, 40 other OI patients did not have the same missense mutation, indicating other factors contributed to the phenotype in the identical twins. This discovery of the linkage with NET mutations that results in decreased norepinephrine reuptake activity and <b>orthostatic</b> <b>intolerance</b> suggests faulty NE uptake mechanisms can contribute to cardiovascular disease.|$|E
50|$|The {{skeletal}} pump {{is vital}} in negating <b>orthostatic</b> <b>intolerance</b> when standing. When moving upright, the blood volume {{moves to the}} peripheral parts of the body.
