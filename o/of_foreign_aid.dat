5|$|Abu Nuwar's enmity with Glubb Pasha, the Arab Legion's {{powerful}} British {{chief of}} staff, his insistence on establishing Arab command over {{the army and}} his influence with Hussein led the latter to dismiss Glubb Pasha and appoint Abu Nuwar in his place. However, Abu Nuwar's ardent support for the pan-Arabist policies of Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser contributed to Jordan's increasing isolation from the UK and the US, which were major sources <b>of</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>aid</b> to Jordan. At the same time, existing dissatisfaction with Abu Nuwar's leadership by palace officials and veteran Bedouin army units culminated into violent confrontations at the large army barracks in Zarqa between royalist and Arab nationalist units. Two principal accounts emerged regarding the events at Zarqa, with the royalist version holding that the incident was an abortive coup by Abu Nuwar against Hussein, and the dissident version asserting {{that it was a}} staged, American-backed counter-coup by Hussein against the pan-Arabist movement in Jordan. In any case, Abu Nuwar resigned and was allowed to leave Jordan for Syria. He was subsequently sentenced to 15 years in absentia.|$|E
5|$|Middleton {{adopted a}} {{strategy}} of raid and harrying. Although successful in distracting the Commonwealth forces and causing disruption, it soon began to prove counter-productive, as growing unpopularity led to a drying up of recruitment. With his return to Scotland after his brief naval command against the Dutch, Monck began a campaign against the rising, making forced marches of between 12 and 20 miles a day in difficult terrain. On 19 July 1654 a force from Monck's command under Thomas Morgan caught Middleton's army at Dalnaspidal. In the resulting battle the royalists were scattered and a wounded Middleton was forced to escape to the Highlands. The end of the Dutch War meant there was no possibility <b>of</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>aid</b> and government reinforcements were now available to combat the rising. As a result, the Royalist military effort petered out. Eventually, Glencairn surrendered to Monck and Middleton escaped to the continent to join the court in exile.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, Bevin {{criticized the}} Affordable Care Act {{and called for}} {{repealing}} it in its entirety. His proposed alternatives included allowing insurance providers to compete across state lines, capping damages awarded for pain and suffering, allowing individuals to purchase health insurance with pre-tax earnings, and providing federal block grants to states {{to allow them to}} cover individuals with pre-existing conditions. He opposed tax increases and the allocation of federal earmarks. He called for massive spending cuts in the federal bureaucracy, specifically the Department of Education and the Veterans Administration, and for reforming eligibility requirements for entitlement programs, including raising age requirements, imposing means tests, and ending federal benefits to illegal immigrants. He opposed U.S. intervention in the Syrian Civil War and the disbursement <b>of</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>aid</b> to countries that deny basic freedoms to their citizens or are guilty of human rights violations. He opposed federal agribusiness subsidies and warantless federal surveillance and called for simplifying the child adoption process. Endorsed by Gun Owners of America, he pledged to resist any restrictions on the types of guns or ammunition that citizens could purchase. A supporter of congressional term limits, Bevin signed a pledge authored by the non-profit U.S. Term Limits stating that, if elected, he would co-sponsor and vote for a bill restricting individuals to three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives and two terms in the U.S. Senate.|$|E

Receiving <b>foreign</b> <b>aids</b> will result in increased supply of resources for granting loan, based on which, relation between domestic investments and saving will be diminished. Also, with receiving giant foreign loans by the mentioned countries, these countries will activate their investment and production cycles and their dependencies on domestic savings will be lessened...|$|R
40|$|Following the {{dramatic}} takeoff of contemporary China-Africa {{relationship in the}} late 1990 s, this once neglected international phenomenon {{has become one of}} the most topical themes over the past decade. This new popularity is due not only to the growing importance of both China and Africa on the global stage, but also China's rapidly increasing <b>foreign</b> <b>aid</b> on the continent. However, whilst most scholars are focusing on the financial side of the story – the massive concessional loan deals, the generous investments in natural resources and so forth, the primary purpose <b>of</b> this <b>foreign</b> <b>aid</b> – assisting African recipient countries' economic and welfare development – has only generated minimal interest. Little is known regarding how China delivers its <b>foreign</b> <b>aid,</b> and even less about how this <b>foreign</b> <b>aid</b> actually works in the African recipient countries. In light of this situation, this study asks: How has China's <b>foreign</b> <b>aid</b> been assisting Africa's development? On the basis of drawing specific attention to the effectiveness and sustainability <b>of</b> China's <b>foreign</b> <b>aid</b> in Africa, this study also explores the factors that affect these outcomes. Which, as this study finds out in the end, friendship – a factor that is often overlooked by Western scholars and patriotically examined by Chinese scholars. Not only has it continuously played a substantial role in shaping the development <b>of</b> China's <b>foreign</b> <b>aid</b> in Africa, but it is also frequently the most influential underlying consideration that practically undermines China's <b>foreign</b> <b>aid</b> outcomes. All in all, whilst purposed to promote China's <b>foreign</b> <b>aid</b> outcomes, this study improves our understanding <b>of</b> China's <b>foreign</b> <b>aid</b> in Africa. As well it delves into the development <b>of</b> China's <b>foreign</b> <b>aid</b> in Africa, assesses its performance, this study finds the shortcomings <b>of</b> China's <b>foreign</b> <b>aid</b> at present and searches for practical solutions that may contribute to its future development...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examined}} the relationship between health care expenditure and economic growth in Nigeria for the period 1970 - 2009. We employed the multivariate cointegration technique proposed by Johansen and found the existence of at least one cointegrating vector describing a long run relationship among economic growth, <b>foreign</b> <b>aids,</b> health expenditure, total saving and population. This is further confirmed by the Hassen Parameter instability test. The cointegrating equation however shows some deviations in terms of the signs of the coefficients <b>of</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>aids</b> and health expenditure which partly may be attributed to some diversification <b>of</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>aids</b> to other uses or that the allocation to health services is grossly inadequate. It is therefore suggested that an appreciable proportion of the national budget be allocated to the health care services to have a more robust health care programmes capable of fostering economic growth in Nigeria. </p...|$|R

25|$|Aid {{can also}} be {{classified}} according to the terms agreed upon by the donor and receiving countries. In this classification, aid can be a gift, a grant, a low or no interest loan, {{or a combination of}} these. The terms <b>of</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>aid</b> are oftentimes influenced by the motives of the giver: a sign of diplomatic approval, to reward a government for behaviour desired by the donor, to extend the donor's cultural influence, to enhance infrastructure needed by the donor for the extraction of resources from the recipient country, or to gain other kinds of commercial access.|$|E

While a group of new millionaires flourished during Balaguer's administrations, the poor simply became poorer. Morever, the poor were commonly the target of state repression, and their socioeconomic claims were labeled 'communist' and dealt with accordingly by the state security apparatus. In the May 1978 election, Balaguer was defeated in his bid for a fourth successive term by Antonio Guzmán Fernández of the PRD. Balaguer then ordered troops to storm the election centre and destroy ballot boxes, declaring himself the victor. U.S. President Jimmy Carter refused to recognize Balaguer's claim, and, faced with the loss <b>of</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>aid,</b> Balaguer stepped down.|$|E

25|$|Half-hearted {{inquiries}} {{that began}} at the request <b>of</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>aid</b> donors never amounted to anything substantial during Moi's presidency. Although {{it appears that the}} peaceful transfer of power to Mwai Kibaki may have involved an understanding that Moi would not stand trial for offences committed during his presidency, foreign aid donors reiterated their requests, and Kibaki reopened the inquiry. As the inquiry has progressed, Moi, his two sons, Philip and Gideon (now a member of Parliament), and his daughter, June, as well as a host of high-ranking Kenyans, have been implicated. In testimony delivered in late July 2003, Treasury Permanent Secretary Joseph Magari recounted that, in 1991, Moi ordered him to pay Ksh34.5million ($460,000) to Goldenberg, contrary to the laws then in force.|$|E
25|$|Until the {{liberalisation}} of 1991, India {{was largely}} and intentionally isolated from world markets, {{to protect its}} economy and to achieve self-reliance. Foreign trade was subject to import tariffs, export taxes and quantitative restrictions, while foreign direct investment (FDI) was restricted by upper-limit equity participation, restrictions on technology transfer, export obligations and government approvals; these approvals were needed for nearly 60% of new FDI in the industrial sector. The restrictions ensured that FDI averaged only around $200million annually between 1985 and 1991; {{a large percentage of}} the capital flows consisted <b>of</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>aid,</b> commercial borrowing and deposits of non-resident Indians. India's exports were stagnant for the first 15years after independence, due to general neglect of trade policy by the government of that period; imports in the same period, with early industrialisation, consisted predominantly of machinery, raw materials and consumer goods.|$|E
25|$|As of 2010 {{the current}} {{allocation}} of U.S. foreign aid from USAID to Sudan is $420,349,319. The U.S. {{had been involved}} with foreign aid to Sudan for many years.

In the mid-1980s the U.S. provided Sudan with food aid, insecticides, and fertilizers. When Sudan failed to repay loans in 1985, the U.S. ceased all non-food aid. USAID continued to provide humanitarian assistance through 1991. Since 2005 the U.S. government has contributed upwards of $8billion in humanitarian aid as food aid, health care provisions, water, sanitation, and hygiene. They have also given money towards nutrition, agriculture, protection, and economic recovery programs. A large portion of this funding is through USAID, which funds solely through bilateral programs rather than pooling efforts within multilateral organizations.|$|E

25|$|Judge Schwebel's dissent {{was twice}} as long as the actual judgment. Judge Schwebel argued that the Sandinista {{government}} came to power with support of foreign intervention similar to what it was now complaining about. He argued that the Sandinista government achieved international recognition and received large amounts <b>of</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>aid</b> in exchange for commitments they subsequently violated. He cited evidence that the Sandinista government had indeed supported the rebels in El Salvador and noted that Nicaragua’s own CIA witness contradicted their assertions that they had never at any point supported the rebels in El Salvador. The CIA witness said that {{there was no evidence of}} weapon shipments since early 1981, but Schwebel argued that he could not credibly explained why opponents of Contra aid such as Congressman Boland, who also saw the evidence, believed that weapon shipments were ongoing. He further argued that Daniel Ortega publicly admitted such shipments in statements in 1985 and 1986. Furthermore, there was no dispute that the leadership of the rebels operated in Nicaragua from time to time.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s the {{government}} initiated {{a process of}} restructuring and strengthening the national water utility ONEA, while investing heavily in expanding access with the assistance <b>of</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>aid.</b> Through this process the utility was transformed {{into one of the}} most successful and efficient water companies in Sub-Saharan Africa. Improving cost recovery was an important element of this process: Tariffs were increased by 30% to almost €1 per cubic meter, so that ONEA enjoyed a healthy financial situation and reported an accounting profit. Increasing efficiency was another important element: Nonrevenue water declined to 16 percent, an excellent level by regional standards. Labor productivity was increased by reducing the number of employees from 670 in 1991 to 570 in 1995 while the number of customers increased substantially. Furthermore, business procedures were modernized through a computerized customer billing system, customer relations were improved, an internal control system to fight corruption was introduced and a laboratory was established. The mutual responsibilities of the public company and the government were laid out in the form of a Contrat Plan setting quantitative targets over a number of years, as it is common for state-owned enterprises in many Francophone countries.|$|E
