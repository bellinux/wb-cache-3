The Scottish Parliament is unable to legislate <b>on</b> <b>such</b> <b>issues</b> that are reserved to, and dealt with at, Westminster (and where Ministerial functions usually lie with UK Government ministers). These include broadcasting policy, civil service, common markets for UK goods and services, constitution, electricity, coal, oil, gas, nuclear energy, defence and national security, drug policy, employment, foreign policy and relations with Europe, most aspects of transport safety and regulation, National Lottery, protection of borders, most aspects of social security and stability of UK's fiscal, economic and monetary system.|$|E
5|$|The GHMix2.0 mode {{allows one}} to {{precisely}} create songs up to 10 min, and includes pre-defined sample tracks that can be modified on a note-by-note basis as desired. The new Jam mode lets the players select one of several standard pre-set rhythms and then play along with it on the instrument controllers in a free-form mode; however, players can then capture any segment of this music and move it to the Mix mode to compile a song. User songs are then uploaded and downloaded through the GHTunes mode of the Music Studio. While songs that violate copyright will still {{be removed from the}} service, Neversoft will be less aggressive about this and will rely more on user feedback <b>on</b> <b>such</b> <b>issues.</b> The PS2 version does not support this feature.|$|E

40|$|This is {{an attempt}} to argue in favor of social rights as {{essential}} to the building of democracy. The understanding about such case is clear: if democracy cannot be made without citizens, these must have their rights guaranteed, not only basic rights, but also the right to benefit from conditions to thoroughly exercise their citizenship in order lo really participate in democracy.

25|$|Government {{recognition}} of the growing political power of Māori and political activism have led to limited redress for confiscation of land and for the violation of other property rights. In 1975 the Crown set up the Waitangi Tribunal, a body with the powers of a Commission of Enquiry, to investigate and make recommendations <b>on</b> <b>such</b> <b>issues,</b> but it cannot make binding rulings.

It struggled to prosecute past human rights cases, and to achieve military reforms or a fiscal pact to help finance programs to implement peace.

25|$|The syllogistic logic {{developed}} by Aristotle predominated in the West until the mid-19thcentury, when {{interest in the}} foundations of mathematics stimulated the development of symbolic logic (now called mathematical logic). In 1854, George Boole published An Investigation of the Laws of Thought on Which are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities, introducing symbolic logic and the principles {{of what is now}} known as Boolean logic. In 1879, Gottlob Frege published Begriffsschrift, which inaugurated modern logic with the invention of quantifier notation. From 1910 to 1913, Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell published Principia Mathematica on the foundations of mathematics, attempting to derive mathematical truths from axioms and inference rules in symbolic logic. In 1931, Gödel raised serious problems with the foundationalist program and logic ceased to focus <b>on</b> <b>such</b> <b>issues.</b>|$|E
