5|$|From a {{husbandry}} {{point of}} view, hyenas are easily kept, {{as they have}} few disease problems {{and it is not}} uncommon for captive hyenas to reach 15–20 years of age. Nevertheless, the spotted hyena was historically scantily represented in zoos, and was typically <b>obtained</b> <b>in</b> order to fill empty cages until a more prestigious species could be <b>obtained.</b> <b>In</b> subsequent years, animals considered to be more charismatic were allocated larger and better quality facilities, while hyenas were often relegated to inferior exhibits. In modern times, the species faces spatial competition from more popular animals, especially large canids. Also, many captive individuals have not been closely examined to confirm their sexes, thus resulting in non-breeding pairs often turning out to be same-sexed individuals. As a result, many captive hyena populations are facing extinction.|$|E

The danger associated with this method is it may cause manganese poisoning if the product is not correctly purified.|$|E
