5|$|Harry Elmer Barnes {{called the}} book one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>exciting</b> and {{challenging}} {{in the field}} of education since Émile. (This said, Hartup of Contemporary Psychology said Summerhill was closer to Freud's Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality than to Émile and criticized Neill's psychoanalytic overemphases.) The psychoanalyst Benjamin Wolstein put Neill's work alongside that of John Dewey, and Sir Herbert Read likened Neill to Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi and Henry Caldwell Cook. David Carr characterized the book as centered on moral education, despite Neill's recurrent insistence on the danger of moral teachings. Scholar Richard Bailey agreed with Carr's characterization.|$|E

25|$|In 1972, {{he became}} the no. 2 in the world, owing to his winning the US Open in a five-set final over Arthur Ashe.

He became equally renowned for skating in front of the opposing team's bench and twirling his stick around and banging the handle on the ice, as if to put a sword into a sheath, after scoring a goal, something that angered opposing players but captivated and inspired his head coach, Patrick Roy.|$|E
25|$|The Dutch {{travelled}} to the 1990 World Cup {{as one of}} the favourites, but {{the team}} failed to perform as expected.

There they met West Germany in one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>exciting</b> games of the tournament, though the game was marred by an altercation between Frank Rijkaard and Rudi Völler. The Germans gained revenge for their defeat at Euro 1988 by beating the Netherlands 2–1 and going on to win the tournament.|$|E

Paddy Glackin was later {{replaced}} by Tommy Peoples, who was then replaced by Kevin Burke in May 1976. In the five years the Bothy Band were together, they emerged as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>exciting</b> groups {{in the history of}} Irish traditional music.

India's woes continued, being dismissed for only 171, with McGrath taking 4–18 in a brilliant bowling performance. Australia enforced the follow-on, {{and at the end of}} day 3 India were 254/4, still 20 runs behind forcing Australia to bat again. For many spectators, commentators, and even players, the match and the series were as good as lost for India.|$|E

In the early and mid 1960s, Herman gained a wider recognition by fronting one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>exciting</b> Herds to date that featured future stellar names like Michael Moore, drummer Jake Hanna, tenor saxophonist Sal Nistico, trombonists Phil Wilson and Henry Southall and trumpeters like Bill Chase, Paul Fontaine and Dusko Goykovitch. By 1968, the Herman library came to be heavily influenced by rock and roll. He was also known to feature brass and woodwind instruments not traditionally associated with jazz, such as the bassoon, oboe or French horn.|$|E

I’m not exaggerating....Boise State beating Oklahoma in a New Year’s Day bowl game is college football’s equivalent to George Mason reaching the Final Four, with one extremely significant difference: George Mason had its chance to compete for the national title; Boise State does not. Like it or not, Boise State 43, Oklahoma 42 just became the single biggest argument to date for a college football playoff....Not only did they get in the game, they made a major statement on behalf of their mid-major brethren that none of us will soon forget.|$|E
