5|$|The {{woodwork}} {{removed by}} Street was sold for a nominal sum, with {{a condition that}} {{it could only be}} used for a hall, chapel or library. Some pieces ended up in the library and chapel of Forest School in Walthamstow, east London (an institution that previously had no link to the college). Panels under the communion rail were also removed from the chapel, even though Street had reported to the college that these carvings were the only portion of the chapel woodwork with any real value, and had suggested at one point reusing them in connection with the ante-chapel screen and the adjoining seats. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woodwork</b> was transferred to St Edern's Church, Bodedern, in Anglesey, which had links with the college from 1648 until the Church in Wales was disestablished in 1920. Some of the panels may also have been re-used in the Fellows' Library (in the second quadrangle); other panelling at Bodedern came from the college, but not apparently from the chapel, and so may have been from a disused library gallery.|$|E

25|$|Huddersfield Parish Church is a Grade II listed {{building}} on Byram Street, Huddersfield, West Yorkshire. There {{has been a}} church on this site since the 12th century, and it was rebuilt 1834–36 by James Pigott Pritchett. Barber effected an interior re-ordering of this building {{at a cost of}} £2,500 in 1873, as follows. The box pews were replaced by open and cushioned stalls, and the gallery seats were cleaned and painted. The old pulpit was replaced with one of carved oak in Gothic design. There was new flooring of encaustic tiles made by Maw's and laid by W and S Thornton of Huddersfield. John Brook of High Street, Huddersfield, did the painting; possibly decorative fresco or stencilled work. There was gas lighting by brass standards and wall brackets. The whole <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woodwork,</b> including stalls, pulpits, screens (including the screen work in the north and south transepts) was designed by Barber and carried out under his supervision. James Christie was the sole contractor for all the woodwork, and Joseph Shaw was one of the sub-contractors for the carving, working under Christie.|$|E

500|$|There were {{allegations}} that the film was plagiarized from a 1967 script, The Alien, by Indian Bengali director Satyajit Ray.

500|$|On St George's Day in 1684 {{at around}} 10pm, an {{explosion}} in the magazine destroyed the interior of Clifford's Tower entirely. The official explanation was that the celebratory salute from the guns on the roof had set fire to parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woodwork,</b> which later ignited the magazine. Most historians, however, believe the explosion was not accidental. At the time, it was common in the city to toast the potential demolition of the [...] "Minced Pie", as the castle was known to locals; suspiciously, some members of the garrison had moved their personal belongings to safety just before the explosion, and no-one from the garrison was injured by the event. The heat of the fire turned the limestone of the tower to its current, slightly pink, colour. The now-ruined tower was returned fully to private ownership, eventually forming part of the lands of the neighbouring house and gardens belonging to Samuel Waud.|$|E
