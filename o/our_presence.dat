500|$|Hezbollah {{emerged in}} South Lebanon during a {{consolidation}} of Shia militias as a rival {{to the older}} Amal Movement. Hezbollah {{played a significant role}} in the Lebanese civil war, opposing American forces in 1982–83 and opposing Amal and Syria during the 1985–88 War of the Camps. However, Hezbollah's early primary focus was ending Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon following Israel's 1982 invasion and siege of Beirut. Amal, the main Lebanese Shia political group, initiated guerrilla warfare. In 2006, former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak stated, [...] "When we entered Lebanon … there was no Hezbollah. We were accepted with perfumed rice and flowers by the Shia in the south. It was <b>our</b> <b>presence</b> there that created Hezbollah".|$|E

The British-based company was formerly known as Samuelson Group PLC. The company operated three rental depots in the UK and was main agent for Panavision in France and Australia. It also had smaller rental operations in New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Crucially, it controlled three Panavision agencies in the US cities of Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas (acquired from Victor Duncan, Inc.). Panavision CEO William C Scott said, [...] "This transaction provides Panavision with a strong platform on which to grow the international side of our business and also completes our company-controlled distribution system in the US. Additionally, we will immediately expand <b>our</b> <b>presence</b> in key Southeast Asia markets, where television and film activity are expect to grow rapidly.

500|$|The Coetus Internationalis Patrum did, however, {{manage to}} get the {{preliminary}} vote (with suggestions for modifications) on the document put off until the fourth session of the Council, but were unable to prevent the adoption, on 7 December 1965, of the final text of the declaration Dignitatis humanae by {{the overwhelming majority of}} the Council. The expressed view of some that this overwhelming majority was only due to intense lobbying by the reformist wing of Council Fathers among those prelates who initially had reservations or even objections, however, is not accepted by all observers. Lefebvre was one of those who voted against the declaration, but he was one of those who added their signature to the document, after that of the Pope, though not all present did sign. Lefebvre later declared that the sheet of paper that he signed and that was [...] "passed from hand to hand among the Fathers of the Council and upon which everyone placed his signature, had no meaning of a vote for or against, but signified simply <b>our</b> <b>presence</b> at the meeting to vote for four documents." [...] However, the paper on which his signature appears, and which was not [...] "the relatively unimportant attendance sheet which Lefebvre recalled in his interview", bears [...] "the title Declaratio de Libertate Religiosa (along with the titles of three other documents) at the top," [...] and [...] "(t)he fathers were informed that if they wished to sign one or more documents, but not all of them, they could make a marginal annotation beside their name, specifying which documents they did or did not wish to sign. No such annotation is found beside the names of either Lefebvre or de Castro Mayer, which proves that they were prepared to share in the official promulgation of that Declaration on Religious Liberty which they later publicly rejected." ...|$|E

An eyewitness testified, [...] "It was a very common thing for them to rape our girls in <b>our</b> <b>presence.</b> Very often they violated eight or ten year old girls, {{and as a consequence}} many would be unable to walk, and were shot."

For me, the chance to sit down with brother bishops, many of whom I had never met, was a great and awesome experience. What made this experience great and awesome, besides just getting [...] together, was that [...] there was a purpose. Often we had gotten together in the past, but just for social purposes or anniversaries, celebrations, etc. This time it was for the good of the Church. Unfortunately, [...] what happened in the aftermath of Ligonier left us further apart and more disunited than we were in the years that led up to that historic gathering.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, Oregon Public Broadcasting {{published}} an article titled [...] "What is Cesar Chavez's Connection to Oregon?" [...] The article centers on the controversial public debate at the time regarding whether a Portland street should be {{named in honor of}} Cesar Chavez. Those opposed to honoring Chavez with a Portland street had occasionally argued that the activist had no presence in the state. The article contains an interview with a man who assisted Chavez during a public address he made at the state Capitol in Salem, Oregon. The article concludes with an interview with Joseph Gallegos, an early faculty member of Colegio Cesar Chavez who claims that during the 1970s and 1980s [...] "the Colegio was a critical symbol of <b>our</b> <b>presence,</b> the Latino presence here in the state, and also I think trying to bring attention to the problem the Colegio was trying to address, that Latinos were not getting through the four-year institutions." ...|$|E

[...] Regarding the result, Vang said [...] "his film is not a documentary. We can't expect 101 percent correctness." [...] During the filming, Hmong cast members addressed what they believed to be cultural inaccuracies that were being introduced. Cedric Lee, a half-Hmong {{who worked as a}} production assistant and a cultural consultant, said that [...] "Some things were over-exaggerated for dramatic purposes. Whether it was our job or not, I still felt some responsibility to speak our mind and say something, but at the same time, the script was what it was. We didn’t make the final decision." [...] Vang said while many Hmong had objected to some elements, the producers selected the viewpoints of the cultural consultants which [...] "had the most amenable take on the matter and would lend credence to whatever Hollywood stereotypes the film wanted to convey." [...] Vang further said that [...] "this was a white production, that <b>our</b> <b>presence</b> as actors did not amount to control of our images." ...|$|E
