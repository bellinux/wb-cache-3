5|$|Despite its poor {{box office}} returns, The Shawshank Redemption opened to {{generally}} positive reviews. Some reviewers compared {{the film to}} other well-received prison dramas, including: Birdman of Alcatraz, <b>One</b> <b>Flew</b> <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> Cuckoo's Nest, Cool Hand Luke, and Riot in Cell Block 11. Gene Siskel said that like <b>One</b> <b>Flew</b> <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> Cuckoo's Nest, The Shawshank Redemption is an inspirational drama about overcoming overbearing authority.|$|E
5|$|Jaws {{won three}} Academy Awards for Best Film Editing, Best Original Dramatic Score, and Best Sound (Robert Hoyt, Roger Heman, Earl Madery and John Carter). It was also {{nominated}} for Best Picture, losing to <b>One</b> <b>Flew</b> <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> Cuckoo's Nest. Spielberg greatly resented {{the fact that}} he was not nominated for Best Director. Along with the Oscar, John Williams's score won the Grammy Award, the BAFTA Award for Best Film Music, and the Golden Globe Award. To her Academy Award, Verna Fields added the American Cinema Editors' Eddie Award for Best Edited Feature Film.|$|E
5|$|Shiban was {{inspired}} to write the episode based on an incident that involved his wife's father potentially seeing other beings in a room when he was dying. Shiban was also inspired by the 1975 film <b>One</b> <b>Flew</b> <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> Cuckoo's Nest. The series sought out a bowling alley for the opening scenes, but many establishments in Vancouver, Canada were reluctant to yield over two-thirds of their space as well as close down for three days. Eventually, the Thunderbird Bowling Centre was chosen.|$|E

5|$|The {{winners were}} {{announced}} during the awards ceremony on March 24, 1997. Saul Zaentz became {{the third person}} to produce three Best Picture winners, having previously produced <b>One</b> <b>Flew</b> <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> Cuckoo's Nest and Amadeus. He also became the seventh individual to receive an Oscar and the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award in the same year. Best Actress winner Frances McDormand {{was the first person}} to win for a role in a film directed by his or her spouse. Best Original Musical or Comedy Score winner Rachel Portman became the first female winner for composing a musical score.|$|E
5|$|Deodato also hired Perry Pirkanen {{and another}} actor from the Actors Studio to play Jack Anders and Alan Yates, respectively. The latter dropped out {{shortly before the}} {{production}} team left for the Amazon, although he appears in the film as an ex-colleague of Yates. Casting director Bill Williams subsequently chose Carl Gabriel Yorke to replace him for the role. Yorke, a stage actor who had studied under Uta Hagen and appeared in three national tours of <b>One</b> <b>Flew</b> <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> Cuckoo's Nest, was chosen {{in part because he}} was the right size for the costumes and boots, which had already been purchased. Because Cannibal Holocaust was a non-Union production, Yorke originally wanted to be credited under the alias Christopher Savage, but ultimately decided against doing so.|$|E
5|$|Heins {{demonstrates}} how lawmakers {{in other states}} used the Ginsberg v. New York ruling to increase morality-based censorship of material from children. A year after the ruling, an Ohio court determined that Ken Kesey's novel <b>One</b> <b>Flew</b> <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> Cuckoo's Nest was inappropriate for youth. The author explains the dangers in allowing the government to determine appropriate material for youth to view, {{pointing out that the}} belief in sexually explicit material's negative impact on children is unproven. Heins notes that the fear of this impact is used to support morality-based arguments, and appeals to morality should not be a basis for censorship. Not in Front of the Children concludes that censorship under the auspices of protecting youth actually harms them through the censorship itself.|$|E

5000|$|Tolkien {{may have}} just chosen the word [...] "vampire" [...] for its modern connotations of bat-associated monsters.

5000|$|On 17 April, as Stewart entered Quiberon Bay, an American steamer, Florence H, with a {{cargo of}} powder and steel, {{exploded}} in the anchorage. Stewart saved nine survivors, and her crew was cited by the Secretary of the Navy for gallantry during the rescue. On 23 April, Stewart sighted two seaplanes dropping bombs, apparently on a submarine; and she raced to <b>the</b> spot. <b>One</b> aircraft <b>flew</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> destroyer, and the observer pointed {{to the location of}} the sub. Stewart saw first the sub's wake, then its periscope, and finally the dark form of her hull underwater. She was forced to turn away at the last moment due to the effort of a French escort to ram the sub, but dropped two depth charges which brought up large amounts of oil. The action was evaluated at the time as a kill; but the submarine, U-108, survived to be damaged by [...] several days later and finally to surrender at Harwich {{at the end of the}} war.|$|R
2500|$|On {{the same}} day, the {{committee}} {{announced it was}} issuing 18 new subpoenas to individuals within the governor's office and the Port Authority that also included new recipients, {{as well as the}} governor's office itself and Christie's 2013 re-election campaign. The new recipients included assistants to Foye, Wildstein, Baroni, and Kelly. Other new PA recipients included Christie referral, Philip Kwon, deputy general counsel, Christie appointee William [...] "Pat" [...] Schuber, a commissioner, who had served in a variety of local, county, and state elected positions in New Jersey, and Steve Coleman, deputy director of media relations. One of the subpoenas was sent to the New Jersey State Police aviation unit for flight information records when Christie used a state helicopter during the toll lane closings. An agency spokesperson said that Christie had not used <b>one</b> to <b>fly</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Fort Lee area during the lane closings. The subpoenas also sought information related to any dossiers compiled by Christie's re-election campaign and his governor's office on Fort Lee Mayor Sokolich.|$|R

50|$|The Black Witch moth is {{considered}} a harbinger of death in Mexican and Caribbean folklore. In many cultures, one of these moths flying into the house {{is considered}} bad luck: e.g., in Mexico, when there is sickness in a house and this moth enters, it is believed the sick person will die, though a variation on this theme (in the lower Rio Grande Valley, Texas) is that death only occurs if the moth flies in and visits all four corners of one's house (in Mesoamerica, from the prehispanic era until the present time, moths {{have been associated with}} death and the number four). In some parts of Mexico, people joke that if <b>one</b> <b>flies</b> <b>over</b> someone's head, <b>the</b> person will lose his hair.|$|R
40|$|From November 2007 to February 2009 we censused feral Domestic Pigeons {Columba livia f. domestica) {{by means}} of the linear {{transect}} method and the observation method in Prague. We dealt with <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> that <b>flew</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Motolské valley or stayed in the observed territories during the census - the Motolské valley, the Arbesovo square and the Kinských square. The purpose of this work was to learn the number of birds in these populations and hereby contribute to finding the number of the feral pigeons in the whole capital city of Prague. At the same time we investigated relationships between the number of pigeons and abiotic factors (the temperature of the air, the weather), the part of the day, the season of the year and the harvest season. The number of pigeons which were flying through the Motolské valley were on the average of 960 birds / one census (the detected maximum was 6 555), in the Motolské valley were present 60 pigeons / one census on the average (the detected maximum was 192), and in the squares were 50 birds /one census on the average (the detected maximum was 347). We have not found any relationships between the number of pigeons which were flying through the Motolské valley, and abiotic factors, the part of the day, the season of the year or the harvest season.

40|$|Among {{applications}} of formation flying, several case scenarios for High Resolution Remote Sensing Satellite Constellations were {{proposed in the}} literature. For a radar interferometric system a pair of satellites has to be at two different positions that are separated by a distance of several hundred meters during measurement sequence. The satellites can be either in the same orbit or {{in a part of}} approximately parallel orbits. During imaging the relative separation of the satellites has to be stable and precisely known. In the case of an optical payload, one satellite can hold the optical lens system and the other the imaging sensors. <b>The</b> satellites must <b>fly</b> <b>one</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> other or one behind the other at a close range. In the paper, several manoeuvres for Satellite Constellations are analysed and simulated with the respect to fuel consumption. A linear model based on Hill-Clohessy-Wiltshire equations is solved analytically for the fuel consumption analysis. Linear models are optimised serving an approximate solution with respect to optimal fuel consumption respecting constraints, such as maximal disposable time and the instant of required formation position. Better results are obtained when orbit eccentricity is taken into account, as shown in the simulated examples...|$|R
25|$|A 1975 award-winning film, <b>One</b> <b>Flew</b> <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> Cuckoo's Nest, sent {{a message}} {{regarding}} the rights of those committed involuntarily.

5|$|A new convoy, codenamed Operation Excess {{was on its}} {{way through}} Malta with {{ammunition}} supplies. Excess coincided {{with the arrival of the}} Luftwaffe Fliegerkorps X (10th Air Corps) in Sicily to support the faltering Italians in the theatre, after the failed invasion of Egypt. On 9 January the Regia Aeronautica flew a fighter sweep <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Grand Harbour. Eighteen Macchi C.200s from 6° Gruppo were engaged in aerial combat. MacLachlan climbed to 22,000 feet and spotted the enemy fighters 10,000 below. He attacked a group of six and shot one down into the sea where it left a large plume of water. MacLachlan circled the sea and noticed the Italian pilot had escaped his aircraft and survived. Capitano Luigi Armanino was taken aboard a rescue craft to a prisoner of war camp in Malta, wounded in the thigh and arm. MacLachlan claimed a second Macchi shot down minutes later. The following day he attacked an Italian Fiat CR.42 <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Excess convoy as the Italians attacked the ships once more. Four others appeared and they climbed over him and dropped onto his tail. Not risking a five to <b>one</b> encounter, MacLachlan <b>flew</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Excess convoy hoping the ship's fire would protect him The British vessels fired at him in error but his aircraft was not hit.|$|R
