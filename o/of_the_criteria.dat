5|$|QPR's victory {{caused a}} problem for the Football Association as {{typically}} the League Cup winner would qualify for the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, but one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>criteria</b> for that competition was that the team must come from the highest tier of that country's league system. QPR was replaced in the following season's European competition by a First Division side.|$|E

These tests are cerebral angiography to confirm that there is no intracranial blood flow, and a radionuclide scan to confirm that there is no intracranial perfusion.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} Canada's role in the Afghanistan War, {{concerns}} were raised about the stringency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>criteria</b> {{that needed to be}} met to receive the Victoria Cross. Other countries with a Victoria Cross had awarded it numerous times {{since the end of the}} Second World War, some members of the Australian, New Zealand, and British armed forces receiving the decoration for their actions during the Afghan and Iraq wars of the 2000s. Members of the Canadian Armed Forces questioned why some actions by Canadians were deemed worthy only of the Star of Military Valour; citations for individuals who'd received the imperial Victoria Cross during the First World War were very similar to those for Canadians who were presented with the Star of Military Valour during the war in Afghanistan. This led then Chief of the Defence Staff, Walter Natynczyk, to create a special committee to review the matter. The Department of National Defence's Directorate of Honours and Recognition explained concepts of war had changed since the mid-20th century and Canada had also developed a more elaborate honours system.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} other {{different}} types of historic preservation associated with {{the properties of the}} National Register of Historic Places that cannot be classified as either simple buildings and historic districts. Through the National Park Service, the National Register of Historic Places publishes a series of bulletins designed to aid in evaluating and applying the criteria for evaluation of {{different types of}} properties. Although the criteria are always the same, the manner they are applied may differ slightly, depending upon the type of property involved. The National Register bulletins describe application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>criteria</b> for aids to navigation, historic battlefields, archaeological sites, aviation properties, cemeteries, and burial places, historic designed landscapes, mining sites, post offices, properties associated with significant persons, properties achieving significance within the last fifty years, rural historic landscapes, traditional cultural properties, and vessels and shipwrecks.|$|E

30|$|We {{propose a}} simple {{algorithm}} to select another model, where we first consider smaller models that would estimate probabilities faster. We first choose the smallest model. We then test all other models {{in ascending order}} of model size. If a larger model has a lower result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>criterion</b> function T (i.e., higher perplexity), we skip it. If a larger model has a significantly higher result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>criterion</b> function, we select this model as our current choice. We need to determine a threshold γ that defines how much better <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>criterion</b> function must be in order to call it significant.|$|R

25|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>criteria</b> {{by which}} Greek temples are {{classified}} is the Classical order chosen as their basic aesthetic principle.

25|$|Most {{sanitation}} {{systems have}} been designed with the five aspects in mind, but in practice they are failing far too often because some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>criteria</b> are not met.

25|$|Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>criteria</b> have obvious psychodynamic implications, {{such as a}} lack of remorse, poor judgment, {{failure to}} learn from experience, {{pathological}} egocentricity, lack of capacity for love, a general poverty in major affective reactions, and lack of insight into his own condition. Starting in 1972, newer editions of the book reflected a closer alliance with Kernberg's (1984) borderline level of personality organization, specifically defining the structural criteria of the psychopath's identity integration, defensive operations and reality testing.|$|E
