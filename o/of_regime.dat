5|$|By the mid-18th century, Catholicism {{had been}} reduced to the fringes of the country, {{particularly}} the Gaelic-speaking areas of the Highlands and Islands. Conditions grew worse for Catholics after the Jacobite risings and Catholicism was reduced to little more than a poorly run mission. However, Catholic Emancipation in 1829 and the influx of large numbers of Irish immigrants, particularly after the famine years of the late 1840s, principally to the growing lowland centres like Glasgow, led to a transformation of its fortunes. In 1878, despite opposition, a Roman Catholic ecclesiastical hierarchy was restored to the country, and Catholicism became a significant denomination within Scotland. Also important was Episcopalianism, which had retained supporters through the civil wars and changes <b>of</b> <b>regime</b> in the 17th century. Since most Episcopalians had given their support to the Jacobite risings in the early 18th century they suffered a decline in fortunes, but revived in the 19th as the issue of succession receded, becoming established as the Episcopal Church in Scotland in 1804, as an autonomous organisation in communion with the Church of England. Baptist, Congregationalist and Methodist churches also appeared in Scotland in the 18th century, but did not begin significant growth until the 19th century, partly because more radical and evangelical traditions already existed within the Church of Scotland and the free churches. From 1879 they were joined by the evangelical revivalism of the Salvation Army, which attempted to make major inroads in the growing urban centres.|$|E
5|$|Castelli {{set up his}} {{government}} in Chuquisaca, where he presided over the change <b>of</b> <b>regime</b> for the entire region. He planned the reorganization of the Mines of Potosi, and a reform at the University of Charcas. He proclaimed the end of native slavery and servitude in Upper Peru, and the natives were granted political rights equal {{to those of the}} criollos. Castelli forbade the establishment of new convents and parishes to avoid the common practice that, under the guise of spreading Christian doctrine, the natives were forced into servitude by religious orders. He authorized free trade and redistributed land expropriated from the former workers of the mills. The decree was published in Spanish, Guarani, Quechua, and Aymara; he established several bilingual schools as well. Several Indian chiefs participated in {{the first anniversary of the}} May Revolution, celebrated in Tiahuanaco, where Castelli paid tribute to the ancient Incas and encouraged the people to rise against the Spanish. Despite their welcome, however, Castelli was aware that most of the aristocracy supported the auxiliary army out of fear instead of genuine support.|$|E
5|$|Episcopalianism had {{retained}} supporters {{through the}} civil wars and changes <b>of</b> <b>regime</b> {{in the seventeenth}} century. Since most Episcopalians gave their support to the Jacobite rebellions {{in the first half}} of the early eighteenth century, they suffered a decline in fortunes. The remoteness of the Highlands and the lack of a Gaelic-speaking clergy undermined the missionary efforts of the established church. The later eighteenth century saw some success, owing to the efforts of the SSPCK missionaries and to the disruption of traditional society. Catholicism had been reduced to the fringes of the country, particularly the Gaelic-speaking areas of the Highlands and Islands. Conditions grew worse for Catholics after the Jacobite rebellions and Catholicism was reduced to little more than a poorly run mission. There was Evangelical Revival from the 1730s, reaching its peak at the Cambuslang Wark in 1742. The movement benefited the secessionist churches who gained recruits.|$|E
30|$|The MLEs {{resulting}} from Eq. (28) are chosen as starting {{values for the}} estimation and trading procedure detailed in the later sections. To choose the optimal number <b>of</b> <b>regimes,</b> several model selection criteria could be employed such as the Akaike information criterion [28], C-hull criterion [29], and the Bayes information criterion [30]. Typically, the optimal number <b>of</b> <b>regimes</b> based on these criteria is two. The “curse of dimensionality” is still bearable at this level. In the new approach, the number of parameters will more than double if the number <b>of</b> <b>regimes</b> is increased to three. When the data set does not show extreme spikes (i.e., about 3 standard deviations or more from the mean), any {{increase in the number}} <b>of</b> <b>regimes</b> will expectedly result to accurate prediction of spread levels (this is called overfitting), however such setting is also penalised for its complexity.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a new Bayesian approach to structural break modeling. The focuses {{of the approach}} are the modeling of in-sample structural breaks and forecasting time series allowing out-of-sample breaks. The model has several desirable features. First, the number <b>of</b> <b>regimes</b> is not fixed but is treated as a random variable. Second, the model adopts a hierarchical prior for regime coefficients, which allows for the coefficients <b>of</b> one <b>regime</b> to contain information about coefficients <b>of</b> other <b>regimes.</b> Third, the regime coefficients can be integrated analytically in the posterior density; as a consequence the posterior simulator is fast and reliable. An application to US real GDP quarterly growth rates links groups <b>of</b> <b>regimes</b> to specific historical periods and provides forecasts of future growth rates. ...|$|R

25|$|The log-logistic {{has been}} used as a model for the period of time {{beginning}} when some data leaves a software user application in a computer and the response is received by the same application after travelling through and being processed by other computers, applications, and network segments, most or all of them without hard real-time guarantees (for example, when an application is displaying data coming from a remote sensor connected to the Internet). It has been shown to be a more accurate probabilistic model for that than the log-normal distribution or others, as long as abrupt changes <b>of</b> <b>regime</b> in the sequences of those times are properly detected.|$|E
25|$|In 2015 through 2016 the Foreign Affairs Select Committee {{conducted}} an extensive and highly critical {{inquiry into the}} British involvement in the civil war. It concluded that the early threat to civilians had been overstated and that the significant Islamist element in the rebel forces had not been recognised, due to an intelligence failure. By summer 2011 the initial limited intervention to protect Libyan civilians had become a policy <b>of</b> <b>regime</b> change. However that new policy did not include proper support and for a new government, leading to a political and economic collapse in Libya {{and the growth of}} ISIL in North Africa. It concluded that Cameron was ultimately responsible for this British policy failure.|$|E
25|$|A {{new party}} <b>of</b> <b>regime</b> supporters, the Revolutionary National Union (Unión Nacional Revolucionaria), {{was founded in}} November 1936. Although the new party called for {{representative}} democracy, rights for peasants and workers, and socialization of key industries, it failed to broaden Franco's political base. In the end, Franco lost his popular support because he failed to keep his promises to the poor. He dared not expropriate the properties of foreign landowners, who were mostly Argentines. In addition, the Liberals, who still had influential support in the army, agitated constantly for Franco's overthrow. When Franco ordered Paraguayan troops to abandon the advanced positions in the Chaco that they had held since the 1935 truce, the army revolted in August 1937 and returned the Liberals to power.|$|E
