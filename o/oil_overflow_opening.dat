5|$|Maintenance problems. The {{chain-driven}} {{valve gear}} {{proved to be}} expensive to maintain and subject to rapid wear. Leaks from the oil bath onto the wheels caused oil to splash onto the boiler lagging. Once saturated with oil, the lagging attracted coal dust and ash, which provided combustible material, and sparks from heavy braking would set the lagging on fire underneath the air-smoothed casing. The fires were also attributed to <b>oil</b> <b>overflowing</b> from axlebox lubricators onto the wheels when stationary, to be flung upwards into the boiler lagging in service. In either case, the local fire brigade would be called to put the fire out, with cold water coming {{into contact with the}} hot boiler causing stress to the casings. Many photographs show an un-rebuilt locomotive with warped casings, the result of a lagging fire.|$|R

Thesimulations are performed as both parametric studies, withcombined values of outside temperature, wind velocity and winddirection, and whole year simulations. For the latter, aclimate file for the northern Swedish city Östersund isused. The results, for the whole year simulations, are presentedas ventilation availabilities. The ventilation availability isdefined as the relative time of the heating season during whicha specified airflow is exceeded. This specified airflow maye. g. be a Building Code requirement if such exists. The influence of different measures, and combinations ofmeasures, on the ventilation availability has been determinedfor the different rooms. It is found that acceptableventilation availability is possibly to achieve with naturalventilation. However, it requires large supply and overflowopenings and extended ventilation chimneys. These chimneys maybe difficult to accept from an esthetical point of view. Thenatural system is also very sensitive for changes in winddirection. To ensure required airflows at all times, an exhaust orhybrid ventilation system may be necessary. Some recommendations may be based on this study. - Consider the predominating wind direction.

50|$|Flood {{detention}} dams {{are commonly}} used {{as part of a}} flood or storm water detention system. Flood detention systems combine the use of detention basins, detention dams, and channels in order efficiently collect and regulate the runoff. The detention facilities not only regulate the amount of water that is released, but control the quality of the water that is released. The runoff is monitored in order to prevent harmful contaminates and debris from damaging resources like: lakes, rivers, and wetlands. Flood detention dams are constructed methodically. The watershed topographical data, hydrological records, and geological structure for the area are analyzed {{in order to determine the}} most effective location for the flood detention dam(s). The analyzed watershed topographical data, hydrological records, and geological structure display the potential storage capacity, environmental impacts, and physical limitations of the area. As a result, models can be generated to simulate the effectiveness of possible flood detention dam locations and designs. The general design for a flood detention dam has a cross sectional shape of a trapezoid where the longer of the parallel sides is the base of the dam, and the angled sides face upstream and downstream. The flood detention dam has an opening at the top in order to release the flood water at a controlled rate that the channels below can accommodate. The flood detention dam models can be used to determine the necessary dam height and <b>overflow</b> <b>opening</b> size in order to prevent overtopping.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} insure a {{perfectly}} clean surface of mercury for test, the apparatus was arranged so that carefully purified mercury flowed intermittently into a shallow iron cup and out through an <b>overflow</b> <b>opening</b> {{at the surface}} back into an electrically heated still. Direct observation showed that with such a flow the surface cleans itself of any added contamination very quickly. Also, {{the results for the}} wave-length limit were found to be independent of the rate of flow, to a rate far below that normally used, and also unaffected by the presence of gases (air, H 2, O 2, He and CO 2) and even of traces of water vapor in the photochamber. The photo-currents to a copper oxide receiver were measured by means of a quadrant electrometer to within about 1 percent for various Hg lines from a Cooper-Hewitt quartz mercury arc, correction being made for stray light by means of intermediate readings. This arc operated at 92 - 93 volts with 2. 1 amp., was constant to 1 percent. Intensity measurements accurate to 1 percent were made by means of a vacuum thermopile connected to a d'Arsonval galvanometer (sensitivity 10 (- 9) amp.) using a Hilger monochromator to disperse the light and making correction for stray light by taking readings between the lines. Plots of the ratio of corrected photo-current to corrected light intensity as a function of wave-length give the threshold at 2735 A. The corresponding photo-electric work function is 4. 52 volts. This result is free from the objections raised to those of previous observers and seems clearly to be the evaluation of an intrinsic property of mercury uncontaminated by surface impurities...|$|R

40|$|Graded fly ash {{particles}} {{have many}} useful industrial applications {{due to its}} fineness and spherical shape. However, grading of fly ash in an industrial scale is a challenging task. The possibility of using hydrocyclones for this purpose has been demonstrated here based on carefully conducted laboratory experiments. The primary objective {{of this research is}} to study the effectiveness of a classifying hydrocyclone to produce graded fly ash particles. To do this the principal challenge is on the optimization of the process and the design variables to generate graded fly ash particles of various size ranges. The experimental data reveals that the ratio between the underflow and the <b>overflow</b> discharge <b>openings,</b> popularly known as cone ratio, of a hydrocyclone actually controls the particle size separation behavior in a hydrocyclone.

40|$|Early 1900 ’s, Kastner, a German brewing scientist, {{reported}} a strong foam and beer <b>overflow</b> after <b>opening</b> normal beer bottles without shaking. This unwanted {{phenomenon known as}} gushing was also described later in other CO 2 supersaturated beverages (champagne, sparkling wine, cider, soda, mineral water) but seems to be most relevant in beer. Gushing represents severe economic losses and bad brand image. In the 1960 - 1970 s, some causes of this phenomenon were proposed and a fungal contamination of raw material by molds such as Fusarium sp. was suggested but molecules responsible remained unknown. In the 1990 s an amphiphilic peptide produced by filamentous fungi (Ascomycetes) was discovered and was called hydrophobin by Wessels et al. {{on the base of}} its amino-acids sequence. At the end of the 1990 s hydrophobins were tackled as the major responsible molecules for primary gushing by a research group in Finland but the mechanisms remained unexplained. More practically, Casey (1996) submitted the hypothesis that some organic materials formed a solid pellicle around CO 2 gas without explaining how and why. Still later research was intensified in Germany, Japan, Finland and other countries. Due to agricultural practice (grain humidity at harvest) and malting practice (germination temperature), the economic damages caused by gushing become more and more frequent (from one or two times pro decade earlier till three or four times pro decade now). Finally, the missing piece of the puzzle was added by Deckers et al. (2010) making the link between gaseous CO 2 (hydrophobic gas) and hydrophobins (hydrophobic patch) and by introducing the concept of “nanobombs”. Hydrophobins form a crystalline layer around CO 2 nanobubbles resulting in the appearance of surpressurized nanobubbles in a closed bottle. At opening of the bottle these surpressurized nanobubbles will explode due to their contact with the atmospheric pressure. This explosion generates the energy required for the formation of nucleation sites allowing some dissolved CO 2 to escape under an uncontrolled bubble form. Considering the physico-chemical properties of both hydrophobins and CO 2 at atmospheric pressure allowed us to develop a new predictive method for primary gushing applicable to all the production steps, starting from barley till bottled beer (2011). The understanding of this mechanism allows us to bring a definitive solution to a worldwide beer sickness. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{substitution}} of plastics based on fossil raw material by biodegradable plastics produced from renewable resources is of crucial importance {{in a context}} of <b>oil</b> scarcity and <b>overflowing</b> plastic landfills. One of the most promising organisms for the manufacturing of medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoates (mcl-PHA) is Pseudomonas putida KT 2440 which can accumulate large amounts of polymer from cheap substrates such as glucose. Current research focuses on enhancing the strain production capacity and synthesizing polymers with novel material properties. Many of the corresponding protocols for strain engineering rely on the rifampicin-resistant variant, P. putida KT 2442. However, it remains unclear whether these two strains can be treated as equivalent in terms of mcl-PHA production, as the underlying antibiotic resistance mechanism involves a modification in the RNA polymerase and thus has ample potential for interfering with global transcription. Results To assess PHA production in P. putida KT 2440 and KT 2442, we characterized the growth and PHA accumulation on three categories of substrate: PHA-related (octanoate), PHA-unrelated (gluconate) and poor PHA substrate (citrate). The strains showed clear differences of growth rate on gluconate and citrate (reduction for KT 2442 > 3 -fold and > 1. 5 -fold, respectively) but not on octanoate. In addition, P. putida KT 2442 PHA-free biomass significantly decreased after nitrogen depletion on gluconate. In an attempt to narrow down the range of possible reasons for this different behavior, the uptake of gluconate and extracellular release of the oxidized product 2 -ketogluconate were measured. The results suggested that the reason has to be an inefficient transport or metabolization of 2 -ketogluconate while an alteration of gluconate uptake and conversion to 2 -ketogluconate could be excluded. Conclusions The study illustrates that the recruitment of a pleiotropic mutation, whose effects might reach deep into physiological regulation, effectively makes P. putida KT 2440 and KT 2442 two different strains in terms of mcl-PHA production. The differences include the onset of mcl-PHA production (nitrogen limitation) and the resulting strain performance (growth rate). It remains difficult to predict a priori where such major changes might occur, as illustrated by the comparable behavior on octanoate. Consequently, experimental data on mcl-PHA production acquired for P. putida KT 2442 cannot always be extrapolated to KT 2440 and vice versa, which potentially reduces the body of available knowledge for each of these two model strains for mcl-PHA production substantially. </p...|$|R
