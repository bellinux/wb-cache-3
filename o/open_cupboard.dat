6000|$|Mr. Scalper pauses, {{takes another}} {{look around the}} room, and finally lets his eye rest for some time upon a tall black bottle that stands on the shelf of an <b>open</b> <b>cupboard.</b> Then he goes on: ...|$|E
60|$|He {{walked to}} the <b>open</b> <b>cupboard,</b> felt for the slide Joe had {{described}} to him, and drew it forward. A small drawer was behind the orifice, and from this Mr. Merrick drew a packet of papers.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Harby {{was in the}} teachers' room, {{standing}} before a big, <b>open</b> <b>cupboard,</b> in which Ursula could see piles of pink blotting-paper, heaps of shiny new books, boxes of chalk, and bottles of coloured inks. It looked a treasure store.|$|E
5000|$|The term {{cupboard}} {{was originally}} {{used to describe}} an open-shelved side table for displaying dishware, more specifically plates, cups and saucers. These <b>open</b> <b>cupboards</b> typically had between one and three display tiers, and at the time, a drawer or multiple drawers fitted to them. The word cupboard gradually came to mean a closed piece of furniture.|$|R

60|$|In {{other respects}} the Cafe de Bon-Bon {{might be said}} to differ little from the usual {{restaurants}} of the period. A fireplace yawned opposite the door. On {{the right of the}} fireplace an <b>open</b> <b>cupboard</b> displayed a formidable array of labelled bottles.|$|E
60|$|Picture to yourselves, my dear children, a handsome, old-fashioned room, with a large, <b>open</b> <b>cupboard</b> at one end, {{in which}} is {{displayed}} a magnificent gold cup, {{with some other}} splendid articles of gold and silver plate. In {{another part of the}} room, opposite to a tall looking-glass, stands our beloved chair, newly polished, and adorned with a gorgeous cushion of crimson velvet tufted with gold.|$|E
60|$|His {{rooms in}} Sloane Street, {{on the top}} floor, outside which, on a plate, was his name, 'Philip Baynes Bosinney, Architect,' were not those of a Forsyte.--He had no sitting-room apart from his office, but a large recess had been {{screened}} off to conceal the necessaries of life--a couch, an easy chair, his pipes, spirit case, novels and slippers. The business part of the room had the usual furniture; an <b>open</b> <b>cupboard</b> with pigeon-holes, a round oak table, a folding wash-stand, some hard chairs, a standing desk of large dimensions covered with drawings and designs. June had twice been to tea there under the chaperonage of his aunt.|$|E
60|$|He <b>opened</b> a <b>cupboard</b> {{and took}} our two long smock frocks, {{which he and}} his {{companion}} put on.|$|R
60|$|He <b>opened</b> a <b>cupboard</b> in the wall, {{close by}} the second table, and {{returned}} with a pack of cards.|$|R
60|$|And he <b>opened</b> a <b>cupboard,</b> where lay in rows all Rose's dolls, and the {{worn-out}} playthings of her childhood.|$|R
6000|$|Of {{furniture}} {{there was}} not much, only an <b>open</b> <b>cupboard,</b> displaying two silver cups and tankards, a sauce-pan of the same metal, a few tall, slender, Venetian glasses, a little pewter, and some rare shells. A few high-backed chairs were ranged against the wall; there was a tall [...] "armory," [...] i.e. a linen-press of dark oak, guarded on each side by the twisted weapons of the sea unicorn, {{and in the middle}} of the room stood a large, solid-looking table, adorned with a brown earthenware beau-pot, containing a stiff posy of roses, southernwood, gillyflowers, pinks and pansies, of small dimensions. On hooks, against the wall, hung a pair of spurs, a shield, a breastplate, and other pieces of armour, with an open helmet bearing the dog, the well-known crest of the Talbots of the Shrewsbury line.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have two}} worries to bother us," [...] she said; [...] "and the music-master {{is the worst}} of the two. There's a notion at the {{hospital}} (set agoing, I don't doubt, by the man himself), that I crushed his fingers on purpose. That's a lie! With the <b>open</b> <b>cupboard</b> door between us, how could I see him, or he see me? When I gave it a push-to, I no more knew where his hand was, than you do. If I meant anything, I meant to slap his face for prying about in my room. We've made out a writing between us, to show to the doctors. You shall have a copy, in case you're asked about it. Now for the other matter. You keep on telling me I shall fall ill myself, if I don't get a person to help me with Carmina. Make your mind easy--the person has come." ...|$|E
6000|$|Marco and Forester {{went into}} the house, and were ushered into a large room, {{which seemed to be}} both sitting-room and kitchen. A large round table was set {{in the middle of the}} floor, for supper. A monstrous dog was lying under it, with his chin resting upon his paws. There was a great settle in one corner, by the side of the fire. There were chairs also, with {{straight}} backs and seats of basket-work, a spinning-wheel, an <b>open</b> <b>cupboard,</b> and various other similar objects, which, being so different from the articles of furniture which Marco had been accustomed to see in the New York parlors, attracted his attention very strongly. Marco went and took his seat upon the settle, and the dog rose and came to him. The dog gazed into his face with an earnest look of inquiry, which plainly said, [...] "Who are you?" [...] while Marco patted him on the head, thereby answering as plainly, [...] "A friend." [...] The dog, perfectly understanding the answer, seemed satisfied, and, turning away, went back to his place again under the table.|$|E
50|$|Skunks are sensitive, {{intelligent}} animals, {{and like}} all intelligent animals, temperament varies with each individual. Skunks tend to be highly curious and will <b>open</b> <b>cupboards</b> that are left unlocked. Some owners have noticed skunks smelling something that was spilled on the carpet long ago, and attempting to dig {{to find out what}} is buried there. Like ferrets, their curiosity can lead them into danger, especially if they crawl inside reclining chairs or other machinery.|$|R
60|$|He <b>opened</b> a <b>cupboard</b> in his {{sideboard}} {{and gave}} her some soda-water. She had still the air of waiting for his reply.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] rejoined Malone; but {{he looked}} as if the right nail was at last hit on the head, nevertheless. Moore rose and <b>opened</b> a <b>cupboard.</b>|$|R
60|$|Not many doors from here, I {{went into}} a room on the first floor. The woman apologised for its being in 'an untidy mess.' The day was Saturday, and she was boiling the children's clothes in a {{saucepan}} on the hearth. There was nothing else into which she could have put them. There was no crockery, or tinware, or tub, or bucket. There was an old gallipot or two, {{and there was a}} broken bottle or so, and there were some broken boxes for seats. The last small scraping of coals left was raked together {{in a corner of the}} floor. There were some rags in an <b>open</b> <b>cupboard,</b> also on the floor. In a corner of the room was a crazy old French bed-stead, with a man lying on his back upon it in a ragged pilot jacket, and rough oil-skin fantail hat. The room was perfectly black. It was difficult to believe, at first, that it was not purposely coloured black, the walls were so begrimed.|$|E
6000|$|It is unexplainable, {{the average}} woman's passion for cupboards. In heaven, her first request, I am sure, is always, [...] "Can I have a cupboard?" [...] She {{would keep her}} husband and {{children}} in cupboards if she had her way: that would be her idea of the perfect home, everybody wrapped up {{with a piece of}} camphor {{in his or her own}} proper cupboard. I knew a woman once who was happy--for a woman. She lived in a house with twenty-nine cupboards: I think it must have been built by a woman. They were spacious cupboards, many of them, with doors in no way different from other doors. Visitors would wish each other good-night and disappear with their candles into cupboards, staggering out backwards the next moment, looking scared. One poor gentleman, this woman's husband told me, having to go downstairs again for something he had forgotten, and unable on his return to strike anything else but cupboards, lost heart and finished up the night in a cupboard. At breakfast-time guests would hurry down, and burst <b>open</b> <b>cupboard</b> doors with a cheery [...] "Good-morning." [...] When that woman was out, nobody in that house ever knew where anything was; and when she came home she herself only knew where it ought to have been. Yet once, when one of those twenty-nine cupboards had to be cleared out temporarily for repairs, she never smiled, her husband told me, for more than three weeks--not till the workmen were out of the house, and that cupboard in working order again. She said it was so confusing, having nowhere to put her things.|$|E
60|$|In {{the angle}} against the rock, and {{opposite}} {{to the fire}} which was burning in the other corner, was an <b>open</b> <b>cupboard,</b> that held a plate or two, a mug, {{and the remains of}} some broken meat. Before the fire was a table, with one of its legs fractured, and made of rough boards; these, with a single stool, composed the furniture, if we except a few articles of cooking. A book, that by its size and shape, appeared to be a Bible, was lying on the table, unopened. But it was the occupant of the hut in whom Frances was chiefly interested. This was a man, sitting on the stool, with his head leaning on his hand, in such a manner as to conceal his features, and deeply occupied in examining some open papers. On the table lay a pair of curiously and richly mounted horseman's pistols, and the handle of a sheathed rapier, of exquisite workmanship, protruded from between the legs of the gentleman, one of whose hands carelessly rested on its guard. The tall stature of this unexpected tenant of the hut, and his form, much more athletic than that of either Harvey or her brother, told Frances, without the aid of his dress, that it was neither of those she sought. A close surtout was buttoned high in the throat of the stranger, and parting at his knees, showed breeches of buff, with military boots and spurs. His hair was dressed so as to expose the whole face; and, after the fashion of that day, it was profusely powdered. A round hat was laid on the stones that formed a paved floor to the hut, as if to make room for a large map, which, among the other papers, occupied the table.|$|E
60|$|And Babette, who {{had just}} <b>opened</b> the <b>cupboard</b> door for the loaf of bread and the cheese, shut it again with a bang, {{and went back to}} her spinning.|$|R
60|$|There {{fell upon}} him {{the manner of}} a {{conspirator}} revealing secrets. He glanced guiltily round the room; then, creeping on tip-toe, he <b>opened</b> a <b>cupboard</b> behind the bed. Within was a tin basin and a small can.|$|R
60|$|He {{stepped back}} on the gallery. She closed the door, bolted it, and still holding the gun, <b>opened</b> a <b>cupboard,</b> poured out a glass of whiskey, and {{returning}} to the door, opened it and handed him the liquor.|$|R
60|$|Often had De Montespan feigned a faint in {{the days}} when she wished to disarm the anger of the king. So she had drawn his arms round her, and won the pity which is the twin sister of love. But now she knew what it was to have the senses struck out of her by a word. She could not doubt the truth of what she heard. There was that in her rival's face, in her steady eye, in her quiet voice, which carried {{absolute}} conviction with it. She stood stunned for an instant, panting, her outstretched hands feeling at the air, her defiant eyes dulling and glazing. Then, with a short sharp cry, the wail of one who has fought hard and yet knows that she can fight no more, her proud head drooped, and she fell forward senseless at the feet of her rival. Madame de Maintenon stooped and raised her up in her strong white arms. There was true grief and pity in her eyes as {{she looked down at the}} snow-pale face which lay against her bosom, all the bitterness and pride gone out of it, and nothing left save the tear which sparkled under the dark lashes, and the petulant droop of the lip, like that of a child which had wept itself to sleep. She laid her on the ottoman and placed a silken cushion under her head. Then she gathered together and put back into the <b>open</b> <b>cupboard</b> all the jewels which were scattered about the carpet. Having locked it, and placed the key on the table where its owner's eye would readily fall upon it, she struck a gong, which summoned the little black page.|$|E
60|$|Ivan's cookery incited the {{additional}} guard to eat so much supper, {{that he brought}} on a severe attack of his fever, and was obliged to go home; but old Ibrahim, {{instead of going to}} bed, sat down on a log of wood opposite the prisoner, and seemed resolved to watch him all night. The woman and child went to bed in the inner room, and Ivan signed to his master to take the guitar, and began to dance. The old man's axe was in an <b>open</b> <b>cupboard</b> {{at the other end of}} the room, and after many gambols and contortions, during which the Major could hardly control his fingers to touch the strings, Ivan succeeded in laying his hands upon it, just when the old man was bending over the fire to mend it. Then, as Ibrahim desired that the music should cease, he cut him down with a single blow, on his own hearth. And the daughter-in-law coming out to see what had happened, he slew her with the same weapon. And then, alas! in spite of the commands, entreaties, and cries of his master, he dashed into the inner room, and killed the sleeping child, lest it should give the alarm. Kascambo, utterly helpless to save, fell almost fainting upon the bloody floor, and did not cease to reproach Ivan, who was searching the old man's pockets for the key of the fetters, but it was not there, nor anywhere else in the hut, and the irons were so heavy that escape was impossible in them. Ivan at last knocked off the clog and the chains on the wrist with the axe, but he could not break the chains round the legs, and could only fasten them as close as he could to hinder them clanking. Then securing all the provisions he could carry, and putting his master into his military cloak, obtaining also a pistol and dagger, they crept out, but not on the direct road. It was February, and the ground was covered with snow. All night they walked easily, but at noon the sun so softened it that they sank in at every step, and the Major's chains rendered each motion terrible labour. It was only on the second night that Ivan, with his axe, succeeded in breaking through the fastenings, and by that time the Major's legs were so swollen and stiffened that he could not move without extreme pain. However, he was dragged on through the wild mountain paths, and then over the plains for several days more, till they were on the confines of another tribe of Tchetchenges, who were overawed by Russia, and in a sort of unwilling alliance. Here, however, a sharp storm, and a fall into the water, completely finished Kascambo's strength, and he sank down on the snow, telling Ivan to go home and explain his fate, and give his last message to his mother.|$|E
5000|$|One of Bonfigli's best {{preserved}} works, the Annunciation depicts mother Mary receiving {{two small}} flames into her heart from the Dove of the Holy Spirit, sent down by God surrounded by cherubs. The work {{is believed to}} have been executed between 1440 and 1445. The Virgin Mary appears to pray on the right next to the Archangel Gabriel with gold wings on the left. Gabriel is kneeling with a lily in his left hand, and his right hand raised in blessing while he pronounces the phrase on the marbel-panelled parapet, [...] "AVE MARIA GRATIA PLENA," [...] or [...] "Hail Mary full of grace." [...] Within the open terrace enclosed by the decorated parapet is Mary's lectern and wooden chair in the middle distance. An open prayer book rests on the lectern, which has an <b>open</b> <b>cupboard</b> containing various books. The background depicts a walled city on the shores of a lake, active with merchant vessels.|$|E
60|$|As I <b>opened</b> {{the second}} <b>cupboard</b> {{it struck me}} that the light was {{beginning}} to fail.|$|R
50|$|Heedless of this reprimand, Brownrigg also {{severely}} abused {{two other}} domestic servants, Mary Mitchell and Mary Clifford. Like Jones before her, Mitchell sought {{refuge from the}} abusive behaviour of her employer, but John Brownrigg forced her to return to Flower de Luce Road. Clifford was entrusted to Brownrigg's care, despite the Governors' earlier concerns about her abusive behaviour towards her charges. As a result, Brownrigg engaged in more excessive punishment towards Clifford. She was kept naked, forced to sleep on a mat inside a coal hole, and when she forced <b>open</b> <b>cupboards</b> for food because she was fed only bread and water, Elizabeth Brownrigg repeatedly beat her for a day's duration, chained to a roof beam in her kitchen.|$|R
60|$|The {{contents}} of the chiffonier disappointed him--judging by the tone in which he muttered to himself. The next sound startled Teresa; it was a tap against the lintel of the door behind which she was standing. He had thrown <b>open</b> the <b>cupboard.</b>|$|R
60|$|It was a queer little bed-sitting-room {{almost in}} the roof, with a {{partition}} right across it. As usual Brendon lit the candles, and Sydney dragged out the spirit-lamp {{and set it}} going. Anna <b>opened</b> a <b>cupboard</b> and produced cups and saucers and a tin of coffee.|$|R
6000|$|The lost {{recollection}} now {{came back}} to him in intelligible form. The [...] "remedy" [...] that Madame Fontaine had locked up--the precious [...] "remedy" [...] made by the wonderful master who knew everything--was at his disposal. He had only to <b>open</b> the <b>cupboard,</b> and to have it in his own possession.|$|R
6000|$|Ervic {{hesitated a}} moment but, remembering that he need not {{consider}} Reera's anger if he succeeded in transforming the fishes, {{he was about to}} <b>open</b> the <b>cupboard</b> when he was arrested by the voices of the fishes, which stuck their heads above the water in the kettle and called out: ...|$|R
60|$|He <b>opened</b> chests and <b>cupboards,</b> such as did not baffle {{his small}} experience, {{and in these}} he found the {{contents}} much better preserved.|$|R
60|$|I, in the meanwhile, was glancing {{round the}} room and soon spied a wall {{cupboard}} which had obviously been deliberately screened by the bedstead. While my companion was bringing the whole majesty of the law to bear upon the miscreant's denegations I calmly dragged the bedstead aside and <b>opened</b> the <b>cupboard</b> door.|$|R
60|$|Then I flung <b>open</b> a <b>cupboard</b> door, {{and what}} I saw {{confirmed}} a growing suspicion. For legal reasons whisky is scarce on {{portions of the}} prairie, but a timely dose of alcohol has saved many a man's life in the Canadian frost, and we always kept some spirits in case of emergency.|$|R
