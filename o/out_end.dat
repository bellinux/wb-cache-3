50|$|Golf courses {{have not}} always had {{eighteen}} holes. The St Andrews Links occupy a narrow strip of land along the sea. As early as the 15th century, golfers at St Andrews established a trench through the undulating terrain, playing to holes whose locations were dictated by topography. The course that emerged featured eleven holes, laid <b>out</b> <b>end</b> to end from the clubhouse {{to the far end}} of the property. One played the holes out, turned around, and played the holes in, for a total of 22 holes. In 1764, several of the holes were deemed too short, and were therefore combined. The number was thereby reduced from 11 to nine, so that a complete round of the links comprised 18 holes. Due to the status of St Andrews as the golfing capital, all other courses followed suit and the 18 hole course remains the standard to the present day.|$|E

One team must defend two crates filled with gold while the other team attempts to destroy the crates. Once the crates are destroyed, more of the map is available to fight on with new crates appearing, along with added reinforcement numbers. The attacking team has a limited amount of respawns to achieve their goal of capturing the 3-5 gold stashes either by setting charges or simply destroying the 2 crates of gold at each base. The defending team has an unlimited amount of respawns available, but their goal is to exhaust the attacking teams respawns.|$|E

40|$|Invasive Candida {{infection}}s (ICI) {{have become}} the third {{most common cause of}} late-onset infection among extremely preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit. Candida colonization of the skin and gastrointestinal tract is an important first step in the pathogenesis of invasive disease. Factors such as exposure to broad spectrum antimicrobials, especially third generation cephalosporin, parenteral nutrition including lipid emulsion, central venous catheter, and abdominal surgery increase the risk of invasive infection. A definite diagnosis of ICI requires isolation the organism from blood or other sterile body fluid. Thrombocytopenia is very common in neonatal candidiasis, but it is also often seen in babies with bacteremia. Candida is capable of invading all vital organs and following candidemia, therefore a thorough evaluation to rule <b>out</b> <b>end</b> organ dissemination is important.
