5|$|Pierce's 1954 {{season was}} {{interrupted}} when he reported {{pain in his}} left arm in a May 25 win over Cleveland; after several days of difficulty in determining the problem, he had <b>oral</b> <b>surgery</b> to remove an infected wisdom tooth and adjacent molar on June 3. He did not pitch again until June 20, but a lack of arm strength caused him to be ineffective in that start before slowly coming back with two relief appearances and another poor start, finally picking up wins with consecutive 3–0 shutouts on July 5 and 11, the latter being his fourth career two-hitter. It was later reported that the tooth problem had possibly existed as early as spring training, when Pierce initially suffered arm problems. But although he recorded only nine wins that season, {{he was one of}} just four pitchers to defeat the Indians three times as they racked up a league-record 111 victories, after also having been one of four pitchers to defeat the champion Yankees four times in 1953.|$|E
5|$|The use of bone {{building}} drugs, like bisphosphonates and anti-RANKL drugs {{require special}} consideration with implants, {{because they have}} been associated with a disorder called Bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ). The drugs change bone turnover, which is thought to put people at risk for death of bone when having minor <b>oral</b> <b>surgery.</b> At routine doses (for example, those used to treat routine osteoporosis) the effects of the drugs linger for months or years but the risk appears to be very low. Because of this duality, uncertainty exists in the dental community about how to best manage the risk of BRONJ when placing implants. A 2009 position paper by the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons, discussed that the risk of BRONJ from low dose oral therapy (or slow release injectable) as between 0.01 and 0.06 percent for any procedure done on the jaws (implant, extraction, etc.). The risk is higher with intravenous therapy, procedures on the lower jaw, people with other medical issues, those on steroids, those on more potent bisphosphonates and people who have taken the drug for more than three years. The position paper recommends against placing implants in people who are taking high dose or high frequency intravenous therapy for cancer care. Otherwise, implants can generally be placed and the use of bisphosphonates does not appear to affect implant survival.|$|E

30|$|Our results {{indicated}} that, under the strict implementation of infection control policies and guidelines, dentists {{were not as}} compliant as we thought, which means policies and guidelines are not perfect enough. Dentists did not provide patients with adequate postoperative-advices to avoid the cross infection after dental extraction or other <b>oral</b> <b>surgeries,</b> even when dentists had been educated. The proportion of dentists giving postoperative-advices regarding the disposal of tampon and giving special postoperative-advices to patients with blood-transmitted diseases increased slightly after education, which means most dentists did not pay enough attention to these issues (Elkarim et al. 2004; Porter 1991). To prevent infections in the Department of Stomatology, some hygiene rules must be followed. It is necessary to enhance the education for dentists and revise the guidelines on how to disposal of the blood-contaminated tampon after <b>oral</b> <b>surgeries</b> (Barlean et al. 2012, 2013). In addition, it is also necessary for dentists to provide patients with both verbal and written postoperative-advices, because patients may not notice and remember what dentists say after <b>oral</b> <b>surgeries.</b>|$|R

500|$|Subcutaneous {{emphysema}} is {{a common}} result of certain types of surgery; for example {{it is not unusual}} in chest surgery. [...] It may also occur from surgery around the esophagus, and is particularly likely in prolonged surgery. Other potential causes are positive pressure ventilation for any reason and by any technique, in which its occurrence is frequently unexpected. It may also occur as a result of <b>oral</b> <b>surgery,</b> laparoscopy, and cricothyrotomy. [...] In a pneumonectomy, in which an entire lung is removed, the remaining bronchial stump may leak air, a rare but very serious condition that leads to progressive subcutaneous emphysema. Air can leak out of the pleural space through an incision made for a thoracotomy to cause subcutaneous emphysema. [...] On infrequent occasions, the condition can result from dental surgery, usually due to use of high-speed tools that are air driven. [...] These cases result in usually painless swelling of the face and neck, with an immediate onset, the crepitus (crunching sound) typical of subcutaneous emphysema, and often with subcutaneous air visible on X-ray.|$|E
