5|$|Both armies used child soldiers, mainly between 14 and 17 {{years of}} age. The usage of {{juvenile}} soldiers was not rare in World War I; {{children of the}} time were under the absolute authority of adults and generally were not shielded against exploitation. In the Finnish case, the military leaders took whoever they could get their hands <b>on,</b> <b>at</b> the less organised start of the war. In the Red Guards there was the chance for salary and food.|$|E

Eichelberger graduated as a Distinguished Graduate, one of the top quarter of the class, and stayed <b>on</b> <b>at</b> the Command and General Staff College as its Adjutant General. In 1929, he became a student at the Army War College. On graduation, he was posted back to the Adjutant General's Office in Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{successful}} collaboration on the pitch, {{a strong}} personal rivalry developed between Ramsey and Nicholson, partly because both {{liked the idea}} of staying <b>on</b> <b>at</b> Tottenham in a coaching role after retiring. Rowe made clear to Ramsey that he wanted him to do so, but unfortunately for him Rowe stepped down in February 1955, citing health issues. Another challenge to Ramsey's position at Tottenham {{came in the form of}} Danny Blanchflower, a Northern Ireland international wing-half signed from Aston Villa to replace Nicholson. Blanchflower was a more attacking player than Nicholson and thus did not provide the necessary cover for Ramsey to advance upfield; Ramsey also resented the idea that Blanchflower might supplant him as Tottenham's main strategist.|$|E
