5|$|Founded in 1875 as the First Hebrew Congregation <b>of</b> <b>Oakland,</b> Temple Sinai is {{the oldest}} synagogue in the East Bay region of the San Francisco Bay Area. It grew out of Oakland's Hebrew Benevolent Society, which had been {{organized}} in 1862 by eighteen merchants and shopkeepers from several foreign countries—predominantly Polish Jews from Posen. Although Hebrew Benevolent Societies typically ceased operations upon the founding of a synagogue, Oakland's was unusual in continuing to function independently {{for a number of}} years (the two groups did not merge until 1881).|$|E

5|$|The road {{has long}} {{served as a}} de facto {{cultural}} dividing line between the predominantly poor black city and its wealthier, predominantly white northern suburbs.

However, in recent years increasing numbers of whites have moved into Detroit, especially around the downtown area, and other neighborhoods in the region have become more ethnically diverse as well.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, Greek Orthodox churches {{beginning}} in the 1950s tended to use a large central dome with a ring of windows at its base evocative of the central dome of Hagia Sophia, rather than more recent or more historically common Byzantine types, such as the Greek-cross-octagon or five-domed quincunx plans. Examples include Annunciation Greek Orthodox Church, completed in 1961 but designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in 1957, Ascension Greek Orthodox Cathedral <b>of</b> <b>Oakland</b> (1960), and Annunciation Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Atlanta (1967). The use of a large central dome in American Greek Orthodox churches continued in the 1960s and 1970s before moving toward smaller Middle Byzantine domes, or versions of Early Christian basilicas.|$|E
5|$|Baith Israel hired Marcus Friedlander as rabbi in 1887. Born in Congress Poland in 1862, he left Russia for England {{before he}} was twenty. Though {{speaking}} little English at the time, he graduated there from the London Theological Seminary, before emigrating to the United States. He was 24 {{years old when he}} assumed the post at Baith Israel, at the time the youngest man in New York state to be appointed to so significant a position of Jewish leadership. Friedlander served until 1893, when he resigned to take a more lucrative position in California at the First Hebrew Congregation <b>of</b> <b>Oakland.</b> After Friedlander left, his name was, for reasons unknown, deleted from the synagogue histories, and the financial records and minute books dating from his tenure were removed from Baith Israel's archives. He was succeeded by Joseph Taubenhaus, the brother of Dr. Gottheil/Godfrey Taubenhaus, the rabbi of Congregation Beth Elohim; another brother, Jacob/Jean Taubenhaus was a famous French chess master.|$|E
5|$|Continuing east, M-102 intersects M-39 (Southfield Freeway) and M-10 (Lodge Freeway) {{south of}} the Southfield campus <b>of</b> <b>Oakland</b> Community College and the Northland Center Mall. As the highway {{approaches}} M-1 (Woodward Avenue), there are a pair of service drives that split from the main roadway in each direction to provide access through the interchange with M-1. The main lanes of M-102 pass under M-1 and its ramp connections before the service drives merge back in on the other side. This interchange is located adjacent to the Michigan State Fairgrounds, former site of the now-defunct Michigan State Fair, and Woodlawn Cemetery. East of the fairgrounds, the highway crosses a line of the Canadian National Railway that also carries Amtrak passenger traffic; the line is south of a rail terminal in Ferndale. Further east, M-102 meets I-75 before intersecting Dequindre Road. Dequindre is the boundary between Oakland and Macomb counties.|$|E

5|$|US219 enters Maryland in the {{southwest}} corner of Garrett County just to the west of Backbone Mountain. The U.S. Highway heads northeast from the West Virginia state line as two-lane Garrett Highway. After crossing the Youghiogheny River, US 219 meets US50 (George Washington Highway) at an intersection with a two-way stop in the hamlet of Red House. The highway turns northwest to intersect Ben Dewitt Road, a shortcut between US219 and US50 at the state line to the west, then resumes its northeasterly course heading toward Gortner, where the highway crosses Cherry Creek and Ambrose Run. US219 veers north and crosses the Little Youghiogheny River and CSX's Mountain Subdivision before entering the town <b>of</b> <b>Oakland</b> and meeting the west end of MD135 (Maryland Highway). The U.S. Highway turns west onto Oak Street while Ninth Street (unsigned MD 219) continues north. US219 heads west through the Oakland Historic District. At the intersection with MD39 (Oak Street) next to the Garrett County Courthouse, the highway turns north onto Third Street. US219 parallels Cherry Glade Run north out of town.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, MD32 was {{extended}} east on Guilford Road from US1 to the Howard Anne Arundel county line at Annapolis Junction. The state highway was relocated to its present alignment from Glenelg to Clarksville between 1961 and 1964, bypassing Ten Oaks Road. MD32 was expanded to a four-lane divided highway in West Friendship when its interchange with I-70 was reconstructed as a diamond interchange in 1973. MD32 {{was extended}} east into Anne Arundel County in 1969 when the designation {{was extended to}} {{just east of the}} BaltimoreWashington Parkway on the edge of Fort George G. Meade. The first two sections of what would become the Patuxent Freeway opened in 1972. A short section of divided highway opened from just west <b>of</b> <b>Oakland</b> Mills Road in Guilford to a turnaround just west of Vollmerhausen Road that included MD32's modern interchange with I-95. The other section was a two-lane road from MD175 in Odenton northeast along Sappington Station Road and then east along the current alignments of MD32 and I-97 to MD178 just east of I-97 Exit 5 in Crownsville. The eastern section, which from 1972 to 1977 was one of the three disjoint sections of mainline MD32 between Crownsville and Taneytown, included an interchange with MD3 in Millersville. As of 1978, MD32's interchange with the BaltimoreWashington Parkway was a partial cloverleaf interchange with four ramps {{on the north side of}} MD32due to the state highway closely paralleling the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad's spur to the military baseand a fifth ramp from the northbound Parkway to eastbound MD32. The MD3 interchange included the ramps to and from MD32 in the direction of Fort Meade plus a ramp from westbound MD32 to northbound MD3. All other movements were made via MD178 or Millersville Road.|$|E
