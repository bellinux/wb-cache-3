5|$|Although issue #7 sold out, Image Comics PR & Marketing Director Jennifer deGuzman {{announced}} in a December 12, 2012 letter to retailers {{that it would}} not reprint select comics, such as that issue. DeGuzman explained the move as a result of decreasing orders on well-performing titles like Saga, despite critical acclaim and consistently selling <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> distributor level, and pointed to orders on Saga #8, which decreased 4% from orders on issue #7. Rather than invest in second printings, deGuzman explained, Image would instead focus its attention on ensuring that the first printing garners the sales desired. This move displeased some retailers, which prompted Image Publisher Eric Stephenson to announce the following day that Image would indeed publish a second printing of issue #7 at a considerable discount, but cautioned that the publisher {{would not be able to}} reprint every issue of the series indefinitely, and implored retailers not to under-order the series.|$|E

5|$|As simple {{ultra vires}} {{concerns}} the exact powers conferred upon government ministers and statutory bodies, statutory interpretation {{is arguably the}} most important exercise the courts need to engage in to determine the scope of powers laid out in the statute. Hence, the cases decided are fact-specific and depend upon each court's interpretation of the relevant statute, making success of the judicial review somewhat unpredictable. The UK case of Attorney General v. Fulham Corporation (1921), illustrates this concept. The defendant was a statutory body establishing washhouses and baths for residents who could not afford their own washing facilities. When it subsequently established a laundry service, the defendant was declared to have acted ultra vires since its statutory purpose was not to carry on a business. Even though the business was carried <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> substantial loss, the statute in question did not give the defendant such a power to do so. Accordingly, the plaintiff was entitled to succeed.|$|E

5|$|Feyenoord {{were the}} next to feel the wrath of United in a {{back-to-back}} fixture. A penalty from Irwin in the home tie helped ensure the Mancunians would increase their tally to nine points, and a hat-trick from Andy Cole in Rotterdam helped maintain their 100% record in the group stage. However, the game was marred by a high tackle on defender Denis Irwin by Feyenoord midfielder Paul Bosvelt (leaving the Irish international six weeks <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> crucial stage {{of the season and}} causing something of a media frenzy back in Britain) and constant clashes between both sets of fans. Nevertheless, United were placed as favourites for the competition, largely due to their impressive start, and a routine 3–0 win at home to Košice all but ensured qualification to the knockout stage. Filippo Inzaghi's late header ended United's unbeaten streak in Europe in their last match away to Juventus, but United qualified as group winners nonetheless.|$|E

5|$|In general relativity, no {{material}} body {{can catch up}} with or overtake a light pulse. No influence from an event A can reach any other location X before light sent <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>A</b> to X. In consequence, an exploration of all light worldlines (null geodesics) yields key information about the spacetime's causal structure. This structure can be displayed using Penrose–Carter diagrams in which infinitely large regions of space and infinite time intervals are shrunk ("compactified") so as to fit onto a finite map, while light still travels along diagonals as in standard spacetime diagrams.|$|E

5|$|Outside of {{the main}} game, players can play an {{additional}} mode called Flick Rush, which can be played alone or with another player via wireless multiplayer. In this mode, players battle {{with a team of}} three Spirits and pit them against each other. Players fight against their opponent by flicking up cards from the touchscreen. Each card has a number value determining its attack strength, with multiple cards combining to increase the overall value. The player whose attack value is greater than their opponent's gets to attack with their Spirit. A slowly replenishing meter determines how many cards the player can send <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time, and each Spirit has a limited amount of cards that can be replenished by swapping them out with another Spirit. The first player to eliminate all of their opponent's Spirits wins the game.|$|E

5|$|The Australian Hornets {{began to}} roll off the {{production}} lines in 1984.

These aircraft remained in the United States until May 1985 for training and trials purposes. The next two Australian Hornets (A21-103 and A21-104) were also built at St. Louis, but were then disassembled and flown to Avalon in June 1984 on board a USAF Lockheed C-5 Galaxy. The aircraft were then reassembled, and A21-103 was rolled <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> ceremony attended by Prime Minister Bob Hawke and the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal David Evans, on 16 November.
