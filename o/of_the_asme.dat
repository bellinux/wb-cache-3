40|$|Unit 2 A Steam Generator {{tubesheet}} {{to shell}} weld, 2 -SGA WG 60, identified a subsurface flaw. A review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flaw {{indicated that the}} flaw {{did not meet the}} acceptance criteria contained in Section XI, Article IWB- 3500 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1989 <b>ASME</b> code. Once <b>the</b> flaw was determined to be outside those acceptance criteria, Duke Power Company (Duke) contracted Framatome ANP to perform a fracture mechanics analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flaw in accordance with IWB- 3600 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1989 <b>ASME</b> Section XI code.
