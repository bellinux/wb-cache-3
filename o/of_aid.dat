The British government sent flights <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> to the territory containing food, clothing, and medical supplies. The House of Commons quickly passed a bill to provide £10,000in aid. The Save the Children fund sent £1,000to British Honduras, and the Mexican government sent three flights with food and medicine to the territory. Two American destroyers arrived in the country by November2, reporting the need for assistance. The USS Antietam remained at port for weeks after the storm with six medical officers and six Marine helicopters. Four other ships sailed to the territory to provide 458,000lb (208,000kg) of food. The United States government allocated about $300,000in assistance through the International Development Association.

The fleet sailed from Rijeka and made several port calls, growing to 29 vessels as it approached Dubrovnik. The convoy, accompanied by the last President of Yugoslavia Stjepan Mesić and the Prime Minister of Croatia Franjo Gregurić, was stopped and searched by the Yugoslav Navy off the island of Mljet before {{the squadron}} linked up with the convoy and escorted it to Dubrovnik.

Despite private appeals for up to $1.4million for reconstruction aid, the Philippine government did not submit a request for international aid. However, by October 25, eight non-government relief agencies provided relief, which totaled $1.15million. Furthermore, the government of Switzerland provided $8,061worth <b>of</b> <b>aid.</b>|$|E

40|$|Although Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (Aids) is both {{a social}} and a medical problem, {{scholars}} largely concur {{that it has been}} imbued with meanings beyond its medical signification. Attempts to objectify the reality <b>of</b> <b>Aids</b> by authoritative claimants within medical science, within the news media and between them seem to have produced multiple realities of the disease. This study rejects the moral panic argument of early research on Aids and proposes instead the social problems constructionist theory and the critical argument of medicalisation. Empirical evidence, obtained through content analysis of all United States national news networks-ABC, NBC, CBS, PBS-and five local Chicago news networks [...] -WGN- 9, WTW- 11, WBBM- 2, WLS- 7 and WMAQ- 5 [...] -as well as survey of 200 students and 200 non-students in the city of Chicago, point out disjunctures in the representation <b>of</b> <b>Aids</b> and responses to Aids messages. However, no major differences were observable between networks in the coverage <b>of</b> <b>Aids</b> news and between groups of respondents, no major differences were observable with regard to knowledge and understanding <b>of</b> <b>Aids.</b> Generally, network television news was noted to give prominent, medically metaphorised coverage to Aids. While television news discourse appeared to have demedicalised homosexuality due in large measure to gay activism, children and race seemed medicalised. Subtly, television news tended to perpetuate a particular set of values providing as such common definitions of reality through the consensual depiction of normal and deviant. Television Aids news discourse seemed not to accurately reflect the actual incidence <b>of</b> <b>Aids</b> among groups <b>of</b> people in the United States or the actual difficulties <b>of</b> <b>Aids</b> research within medical science. Incongruencies were noted between audiences' construction <b>of</b> <b>Aids</b> and television portrayal <b>of</b> <b>Aids</b> as well as the real world <b>of</b> <b>Aids.</b> Although audiences were well-informed about Aids, sympathetic toward PWAs and largely denied Aids was a homosexual disease, yet they mostly blamed television for constructing Aids as a homosexual disease which they mostly said was not realistic. Furthermore, the more educated light viewers were somewhat more skeptical and critical of television presentation <b>of</b> <b>Aids.</b> Constructionists argument that social problems are not objective conditions is supported by highlighting the role of television news in the initial stage of the definitional process of social problems and underscoring that illnesses, such as Aids, tend to be impregnated with denial and blame in the construction of reality. Television, based on news values, made claims by selectively representing the claims, interest and values of the powerful...|$|R
