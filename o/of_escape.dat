Lectures were given in escape and evasion and troop commanders and NCO's were given small silk maps of Norway to help with any escape attempt. Another item <b>of</b> <b>escape</b> equipment issued was a pair of trouser fly buttons that, when placed {{one on top of the}} other, became a small compass.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{funding for}} the {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>Escape</b> from Woomera came from the Australian government's arts funding organisation, the Australia Council for the Arts.

While a playable section of the game was developed, the developers never received additional funding. The playable demo, which was built as a modification of the video game Half-Life, was made available for download on the game's website.|$|E

It originally stood in the Palace of Whitehall's Pebble Court, where it was installed on New Year's Day, 1686.

40|$|We {{investigate}} how the properties <b>of</b> <b>escaping</b> stars {{are related to}} the initial conditions of their birth clusters. We find that the number <b>of</b> <b>escaping</b> stars, their spatial distribution, and their kinematics show a dependence on the initial conditions of the host cluster (substructure and virial ratio). Thus the properties <b>of</b> <b>escaping</b> stars can be used to inform us of the initial conditions of star formation, and also provide a window into the dynamical history of star clusters. The ESA Gaia mission will make observations of the positions and proper motions <b>of</b> these <b>escaping</b> stars at the required accuracy to allow us to investigate the dynamical evolution of local star clusters and provide an important insight into the initial conditions of star formation.

In 2552, the Chief and Spartans return to Reach, where the UNSC High Command has developed a last-ditch plan to capture a Covenant High Prophet, who they hope could be used in order to barter a truce. The Master Chief's armor is upgraded, and he first encounters the artificial intelligence (AI) Cortana during a training mission. The Covenant arrive and invade, despite the best efforts of the Spartans and other UNSC forces.

The aircraft taxied away from Gate26, and departed Logan International Airport at 07:59, following a 14-minute delay. Flight11 was hijacked at approximately 08:14, which is when the pilot stopped responding to air traffic control. Once the hijacking began, the brothers are suspected of having stabbed two flight attendants. At 08:46:40, Mohamed Atta deliberately crashed Flight11 into the northern facade of the North Tower (Tower1) of the World Trade Center. The immediate damage destroyed any means <b>of</b> <b>escape</b> from above the impact zone, trapping 1,344people. The North Tower collapsed at 10:28, after burning for 102 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Haunting Ground, {{known in}} Japan as Demento, is a {{survival}} horror video game developed {{and published by}} Capcom for the PlayStation 2 in 2005.

She quickly befriends a White Shepherd, Hewie, and begins to explore the castle with his aid to seek a means <b>of</b> <b>escape</b> and unravel the mysteries of it and its inhabitants.

5|$|In 2003, CrossGen {{published}} John Carpenter's Snake Plissken Chronicles, a four-part {{comic book}} miniseries. The story takes place {{a day or}} so after the events <b>of</b> <b>Escape</b> from New York. Snake has been given a military Humvee after his presidential pardon and makes his way to Atlantic City. Although the director's cut <b>of</b> <b>Escape</b> from New York shows Snake was caught after a bank job, this story has Snake finishing up a second heist that was pre-planned before his capture. The job entails stealing the car in which John F. Kennedy was assassinated from a casino before delivering it to a buyer in the Gulf of Mexico. Snake partners with a man named Marrs who ends up double crossing him. Left for dead in a sinking crab cage, Snake escapes and is saved by a passing fisherman named Captain Ron (an in-joke referring to Kurt Russell's 1992 comedy, Captain Ron). When Ron denies Snake's request to use his boat in order to beat Marrs to the robbery, Snake decides to kill him. When Snake ends up saving Ron from the Russian mob who wants money, Ron changes his mind and helps Snake. Once at the casino, Snake comes face-to-face with Marrs and his men, who arrive at the same time, ending in a high-speed shootout. Snake gets away with the car and its actress portraying Jackie Kennedy, leaving Marrs to be caught by the casino owner, who cuts him a deal to bring his car back and live. After some trouble, Snake manages to finally get the car to the buyer's yacht, using Ron's boat, and is then attacked by Marrs. Following the firefight, the yacht and car are destroyed, Marrs and Captain Ron are dead, and Snake makes his escape in a helicopter with the 30 million credits owed to him for the job.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to other film tie-in games, which often closely follow {{the events of}} their source material, the development team <b>of</b> <b>Escape</b> from Butcher Bay focused on differentiating the game from The Chronicles of Riddick. They sought to explore Riddick's character in a prison break setting, and took inspiration from films such as Escape from Alcatraz. Starbreeze was also inspired by video games such as GoldenEye 007 and the Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell series. The opening sequence, in which Riddick is escorted into Butcher Bay, {{is a tribute to}} Half-Life, and the game's hand-to-hand combat was inspired by Punch-Out!!. Starbreeze focused solely on developing the game's single-player mode, and did not include multiplayer; the company believed that such a mode would require a design team twice as large and another year of development.|$|E
5|$|Most {{forms of}} {{camouflage}} are made ineffective by movement: a deer or grasshopper may be highly cryptic when motionless, but instantly seen when it moves. But one method, motion dazzle, requires rapidly moving bold patterns of contrasting stripes. Motion dazzle may degrade predators' ability {{to estimate the}} prey's speed and direction accurately, giving the prey an improved chance <b>of</b> <b>escape.</b> Motion dazzle distorts speed perception and is most effective at high speeds; stripes can also distort perception of size (and so, perceived range to the target). As of 2011, motion dazzle had been proposed for military vehicles, but never applied. Since motion dazzle patterns would make animals more difficult to locate accurately when moving, but easier to see when stationary, {{there would be an}} evolutionary trade-off between motion dazzle and crypsis.|$|E
