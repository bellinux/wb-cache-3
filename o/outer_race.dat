50|$|While {{roller cam}} {{followers}} {{are similar to}} roller bearings, {{there are quite a}} few differences. Standard ball and roller bearings are designed to be pressed into a rigid housing, which provides circumferential support. This keeps the <b>outer</b> <b>race</b> from deforming, so the race cross-section is relatively thin. In the case of cam followers the <b>outer</b> <b>race</b> is loaded at a single point, so the <b>outer</b> <b>race</b> needs a thicker cross-section to reduce deformation. However, in order to facilitate this the roller diameter must be decreased, which also decreases the dynamic bearing capacity.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} work a {{methodology}} of metrological kind is suggested. The procedure {{has been developed}} to give information on the relative quality between two or more standard sets of Rzeppa joints made up by different factories. The methodology suggested is based on dimension and hardness evaluations. The main aim of the dimensional evaluations is the tolerances check that characterize the grooves of the inner and <b>outer</b> <b>races.</b> The hardness evaluations are considered {{with reference to the}} tribological aspects. In order to perform a position analysis of the inner and <b>outer</b> <b>races</b> in relation to the six spheres, a suitable CAD model has been made up. This model is essential because it gives the greatest change of certain nominal distances that must be measured versus the axes angle of the inner and <b>outer</b> <b>races.</b> The results obtained in relation to two sets of joints nominally of the same kind but manufactured by two different factories are presented...|$|R
5000|$|A {{ball bearing}} motor {{is an unusual}} {{electric}} motor that consists of two ball-bearing-type bearings, with the inner races mounted on a common conductive shaft, and the <b>outer</b> <b>races</b> connected to a high current, low voltage power supply. An alternative construction fits the <b>outer</b> <b>races</b> inside a metal tube, while the inner races are mounted on a shaft with a non-conductive section (e.g. two sleeves on an insulating rod).

50|$|Rolling-element {{bearings}} {{are widely}} used in the industries today, and hence maintenance of these bearings becomes an important task for the maintenance professionals. The rolling-element bearings wear out easily due to metal-to-metal contact, which creates faults in the <b>outer</b> <b>race,</b> inner race and ball. It {{is also the most}} vulnerable component of a machine because it is often under high load and high running speed conditions. Regular diagnostics of rolling-element bearing faults is critical for industrial safety and operations of the machines along with reducing the maintenance costs or avoiding shutdown time. Among the <b>outer</b> <b>race,</b> inner race and ball, the <b>outer</b> <b>race</b> tends to be more vulnerable to faults and defects.|$|E

50|$|Ball {{bearings}} tend to {{have lower}} load capacity for their size than other kinds of rolling-element bearings due to the smaller contact area between the balls and races. However, they can tolerate some misalignment of the inner and <b>outer</b> <b>races.</b>|$|R
40|$|Damping seals, damping bearings, and {{a support}} sleeve are {{presented}} {{for the ball}} bearings of a high speed rotor. The ball bearings consist of a duplex set having the <b>outer</b> <b>races</b> packaged tightly within the sleeve while the sleeve provides a gap with a support member so that the bearings may float with the sleeve. The sleeve has a web extending radially between the pair of <b>outer</b> <b>races</b> and acts in conjunction {{with one or more}} springs to apply an axial preload to the <b>outer</b> <b>races.</b> The sleeves have a series of slits which provide the sleeve with a spring-like quality so that the spring acts to center the rotor upon which the bearings are mounted during start up and shut down. A damping seal or a damping bearing may be used in conjunction with the ball bearings and supporting sleeve, the damping seal and damping bearing having rotor portions including rigid outer surfaces mounted within the bore of a stator portion having triangular shaped pockets on the surface facing the rotor. Axial gates are provided between adjacent pockets in sections of the stator permitting fluid to flow with less resistance axially relative to the flow of fluids circumferentially between the rotor and the stator...|$|R

50|$|There {{is still}} a room for {{discussion}} whether the rolling element excites the natural frequencies of bearing component when it passes the fault on the <b>outer</b> <b>race.</b> Hence we need to identify the bearing <b>outer</b> <b>race</b> natural frequency and its harmonics. The bearing faults create impulses and results in strong harmonics of the fault frequencies in the spectrum of vibration signals. These fault frequencies are sometimes masked by adjacent frequencies in the spectra due to their little energy. Hence, a very high spectral resolution is often needed to identify these frequencies during a FFT analysis. The natural frequencies of a rolling element bearing with the free boundary conditions are 3 kHz. Therefore, {{in order to use}} the bearing component resonance bandwidth method to detect the bearing fault at an initial stage a high frequency range accelerometer should be adopted, and data obtained from a long duration needs to be acquired. A fault characteristic frequency can only be identified when the fault extent is severe, such as that of a presence of a hole in the <b>outer</b> <b>race.</b> The harmonics of fault frequency is a more sensitive indicator of a bearing <b>outer</b> <b>race</b> fault. For a more serious detection of defected bearing faults waveform, spectrum and envelope techniques will help reveal these faults. However, if a high frequency demodulation is used in the envelope analysis in order to detect bearing fault characteristic frequencies, the maintenance professionals have to be more careful in the analysis because of resonance, as {{it may or may not}} contain fault frequency components.|$|E

30|$|The {{self-lubricating}} spherical plain bearings {{are special}} journal bearings which inlay or bond the self-lubricating solid materials between {{the inner and}} <b>outer</b> <b>races.</b> These bearings have some special characteristics, such as maintenance-free, compact structure, and low coefficient of friction. Therefore, the self-lubricating spherical plain bearings are widely applied to aviation and aerospace fields [1].|$|R
50|$|Common roller {{bearings}} use cylinders of slightly greater length than diameter. Roller bearings typically have higher radial load capacity than ball bearings, but a lower capacity and higher friction under axial loads. If {{the inner and}} <b>outer</b> <b>races</b> are misaligned, the bearing capacity often drops quickly compared to either a ball bearing or a spherical roller bearing.|$|R

50|$|A tunnel {{crankshaft}} {{is considered}} to be a 'tunnel' if the outside diameter over the <b>outer</b> <b>race</b> of the installed bearings is larger than the maximum size of the webs. Early, or smaller, engines may have had crankshafts with bearing journals smaller than this, but were still considered as such because they were larger when the bearings were fitted.|$|E

50|$|Roller {{bearings}} require one-piece {{races for}} both {{inner and outer}} bearing tracks. Although split races are possible, they are expensive and difficult to fit. A simpler means of fitting roller bearings is to enlarge {{the diameter of the}} bearing, so that it becomes larger than the entire crankshaft web. Assembly is now done by putting the <b>outer</b> <b>race</b> of the bearing over the crankshaft axially from one end, rather than by assembling two pieces radially.|$|E
5000|$|An {{angular contact}} ball bearing uses axially {{asymmetric}} races. An axial load passes {{in a straight}} line through the bearing, whereas a radial load takes an oblique path that tends to want to separate the races axially. So the angle of contact on the inner race is the same as that on the <b>outer</b> <b>race.</b> Angular contact bearings better support [...] "combined loads" [...] (loading in both the radial and axial directions) and the contact angle of the bearing should be matched to the relative proportions of each. The larger the contact angle (typically in the range 10 to 45 degrees), the higher the axial load supported, but the lower the radial load. In high speed applications, such as turbines, jet engines, and dentistry equipment, the centrifugal forces generated by the balls changes the contact angle at the inner and <b>outer</b> <b>race.</b> Ceramics such as silicon nitride are now regularly used in such applications due to their low density (40% of steel). These materials significantly reduce centrifugal force and function well in high temperature environments. They also tend to wear in a similar way to bearing steel—rather than cracking or shattering like glass or porcelain.|$|E
50|$|Ceramic {{bearing balls}} can weigh up to 40% less than steel ones, {{depending}} on size and material. This reduces centrifugal loading and skidding, so hybrid ceramic bearings can operate 20% to 40% faster than conventional bearings. This {{means that the}} <b>outer</b> <b>race</b> groove exerts less force inward against the ball as the bearing spins. This reduction in force reduces the friction and rolling resistance. The lighter balls allow the bearing to spin faster, and uses less energy to maintain its speed.|$|E

50|$|The outer {{universal}} joint allows greater angular changes but not changes in shaft length. It is normally {{a ball and}} cage type with an inner race splined to the intermediate shaft. An <b>outer</b> <b>race</b> is formed in the yoke. The cage retains the balls in location in grooves in both races.The balls transfer the drive from the shaft to the hub and allow for changes in horizontal angle and for a wide steering angle to be achieved. A flexible rubber boot fitted to each joint retains grease and keeps out dirt and moisture.|$|E
50|$|Relieved race ball {{bearings}} are 'relieved' {{as the name}} suggests by basically have either the OD of the inner ring reduced on one side, or the ID {{of the outer ring}} increased on one side. This allows a greater number of balls to be assembled into either the inner or <b>outer</b> <b>race,</b> and then press fit over the relief. Sometimes the outer ring will be heated to facilitate assembly. Like the slot-fill construction, relieved race construction allows a greater number of balls than Conrad construction, up to and including full complement, and the extra ball count gives extra load capacity. However, a relieved race bearing can only support significant axial loads in one direction ('away from' the relieved race).|$|E
50|$|Two {{bearings}} {{are used}} per wheel. The bearings slip into openings molded into {{each side of}} the wheel hub, and a flange molded into the wheel hub holds the bearings the correct distance apart. Additionally there is an axle spacer either machined into the axle or that slides over the axle (depending on the axle system used). Since the <b>outer</b> <b>race</b> of the bearing contacts the wheel spacer and the inner race of the bearing contacts the axle spacer, it is critical that the relationship between these two spacers is correct. If the wheel spacer is wider than the axle spacer the bearings will bind when the axle bolt (or bolts) are tightened.|$|E
