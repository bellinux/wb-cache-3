5|$|Because the {{aircraft}} was fully booked, a passenger {{was allowed to}} sit in the jump seat in the cockpit.

From Namsos to Brønnøysund there were available seats in the cabin, but the jump seat passenger continued {{to sit in the}} cockpit. The commission felt that the passenger's conversation with the captain drew his attention and concentration away from his duties at a critical point of the flight. This also disrupted communication between the two pilots, resulting in the mutual control being disrupted.|$|E

Since the incident occurred {{three weeks after the}} September 11 terrorist attacks, Greyhound temporarily suspended all schedules as soon as the company learned of the incident for fear that it may have been part of a larger co-ordinated attack. After investigation by the company and the FBI, it was confirmed that Igric had acted alone and service resumed later that afternoon. After the incident, Greyhound bus stations increased security, though not nearly to the same level as airports or train stations.|$|E
