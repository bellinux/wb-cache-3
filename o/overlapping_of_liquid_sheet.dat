Cold flow experiments on the <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> breakup were carried out by employing custom fabricated gas-centered swirl coaxial atomizers using water and air as experimental fluids. Photographic techniques were employed to capture the flow behavior <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>sheets</b> at different flow conditions. Quantitative variation on the breakup length <b>of</b> the <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> and spray width were obtained from the measurements deduced from the images <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>sheets.</b> The sheet breakup process is significantly influenced by the central air jet. It is observed that low inertia <b>liquid</b> <b>sheets</b> are more vulnerable to the presence of the central air jet and develop shorter breakup lengths at smaller values of the air jet Reynolds number Re-g. High inertia <b>liquid</b> <b>sheets</b> ignore the presence of the central air jet at smaller values of Re-g and eventually develop shorter breakup lengths at higher values of Re-g.

40|$|This thesis aims at {{studying}} the breakup <b>of</b> swirling <b>liquid</b> <b>sheets</b> discharging {{from the outer}} orifice of gas centered swirl coaxial atomizers. Such atomizers are considered as propellant injection systems for semi-cryogenic liquid rocket engines. A gas centered swirl coaxial type atomizer discharges an annular swirling <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> which is atomized by a gaseous jet issuing from the central orifice of the atomizer. The primary objectives of this work were to understand the fluid dynamic interaction process between the outer <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> and the central gas jet and its role on the breakup process <b>of</b> the <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet.</b> Cold flow experiments were carried out by constructing custom made gas centered swirl coaxial atomizers. Two different atomizer configurations with varying swirl effect were studied. The jets were injected into ambient atmospheric air medium with tap water and air as experimental fluids. The flow conditions were {{described in terms of}} Weber number (Wel) and Reynolds number (Reg) for <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> and the air jet respectively. Spray images were captured by employing an image acquisition system comprising a high resolution digital camera and a strobe lamp. The captured spray images at different combinations of Wel and Reg were analyzed to extract quantitative measurements of breakup length (Lb), spray cone angle (θs), spray width (SW) and two-dimensional surface profile <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>sheets.</b> Quantitative analysis <b>of</b> the variation of Lb with Reg with different values of Wel suggested that low inertia <b>liquid</b> <b>sheets</b> undergo an efficient breakup process. High inertia <b>liquid</b> <b>sheets</b> ignore the presence of central air jet at lower values of Reg however undergo air jet breakup at higher values of Reg. Qualitative analysis of experimental observations revealed that the entrainment process, established between the inner surface <b>of</b> the <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> and the boundary of central jet, triggers the air assisted sheet breakup by drawing the <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> closer to the spray axis. The entrainment process may be developing corrugations on the surface <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> which promotes the production <b>of</b> thick <b>liquid</b> ligaments from the sheet surface. The level of surface corrugations on the <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet,</b> quantified by means <b>of</b> tortuosity <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> profile, increases with increasing Reg.

The generated ligaments can be categorized in two general types based on their orientation {{with respect to the}} flow field; span-wise and stream-wise ligaments. This work contains a two- and three-dimensional computational study of the primary breakup <b>of</b> a viscous <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet.</b> A Volume <b>of</b> Fluid (VOF) based code is used to solve the governing equations and capture the interface between the <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> and the surrounding gas. Since the interaction between the liquid and gas is the major source of the breakup, the liquid-gas interface boundary is modified in this work and it is implemented using linear stability analysis. The variation in the breakup time and breakup length <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>sheets</b> with fluid properties is investigated by a two-dimensional study. Fluid properties are stated in three non-dimensional numbers: Weber number, Ohnesorge number and the gas to liquid density ratio.

Two asymptotic regimes for the expansion of the sheet are evidenced. The scalings of the thickness with t and r measured in the two regimes are those that were predicted in Rozhkov 2004 fort the short-time regime and Villermaux 2011 for the long time regime, but never experimentally measured before. Interestingly, our experimental data also evidence the existence of a maximum of the film thickness h_max(r) at a radial position r_h_max(t) corresponding to the crossover of these two asymptotic regimes.

The simulations of the atomization <b>of</b> a <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet,</b> the capillary retraction <b>of</b> a <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> and two- and three-dimensional wave breaking all for air/water systems, are used to show {{the potential of the}} numerical techniques. New simulations of atomization processes for air/water conditions are allowing to investigate the processes leading to the appearance of instabilities in the primary atomization zone in real conditions. For the retracting <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet,</b> the new simulations show that two different regimes can be encountered {{as a function of the}} Ohnesorge number. For large values, a laminar flow is encountered inside the rim and a steady state is reached after a quick transient state. For small values, a turbulent flow is generated inside the rim which is responsible of large oscillations in the rim size and neck thickness. The breaking wave case study demonstrates the orders-of-magnitude efficiency gains of the adaptive mesh refinement method...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Contraction <b>of</b> a <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> an {{incompressible}} Newtonian {{fluid in}} a passive ambient fluid is studied computationally to provide {{insights into the}} dynamics of capillary wave created during contraction. The problem composed of the Navier-Stokes system is associated with initial and boundary conditions that govern the time evolution of the capillary wave and the pressure and velocity fields within it. The correctness of the algorithm is verified with the data of experiment. It can be found that the prediction of the computation agrees well with the experiment. The algorithm is capable of capturing the capillary wave and therefore {{it is used to}} study the characteristic phenomena of that wave created on the surface <b>of</b> the <b>liquid.</b> Results show that the capillary wave is radiated from the tip <b>of</b> the <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> caused by surface tension. The amplitude of the tip wave is much larger than any other waves and the asymptotic approach of the wave peaks can be observed during the propagation of waves. The tip wave contains the highest pressure and gradually the peak values of both high and low pressures decrease with the propagation of waves. Fluid velocity is motivated by both pressure due to surface tension and recirculation in peak and trough of the wave. During the contraction <b>of</b> the <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet,</b> the tip velocity is not uniform. Initially the length of the sheet increases a little and very soon the contraction occurs and continues. After long time, the gradient of tip velocity becomes very small...|$|R
40|$|In this fluid {{dynamics}} video, Ray-tracing data visualization technique {{was used to}} obtain realistic and detailed flow motions during impinging <b>of</b> two <b>liquid</b> jets. Different patterns of sheet and rim configurations were presented to shed light into the underlying physics, including liquid chain, closed rim, open rim, unstable rim and flapping sheet. In addition, stationary asymmetrical waves were observed and compared with existing theories. The generation of stationary capillary wave in respect to the liquid rim were explained by the classic shallow water wave theory. The atomization process caused by development of the impact waves were observed in detail, including fragmentation <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet,</b> formation <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> ligaments, and breakup of ligament into droplet. The locking-on feature of the wavelength of impact wave were also found {{to be similar to}} that of perturbed free shear layers...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} of a two-dimensional gravitational <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> injected in another immiscible fluid are performed {{by means of}} a home-made numerical code, named MultiFluids. Both steady and unsteady configurations are investigated. In {{the first part of the}} present paper, the steady shape <b>of</b> the <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> has been computed by solving the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations for variable density incompressible flows and the interface between the two fluids has been determined by using a VOF method. The analysis takes into account viscous, inertial and gravitational forces. Velocity, pressure and shape of the sheet are investigated and the results are in well agreement with previous numerical and experimental results. In the second part of the work, the transient response <b>of</b> the planar <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet,</b> subject to deflection due to inertial forces, has been analysed. This kind of application constitutes a preliminary study within the framework of a wider investigation about a coating industrial process...|$|R

Theoretical and experimental studies of the fluid dynamics and stability <b>of</b> thin <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> flows {{have been carried out}} in this thesis. A computer program was developed to determine the cross-sectional shape of the edge cylinder given the cross-sectional area of the edge cylinder.

40|$|AbstractAn {{experimental}} {{study on the}} breakup <b>of</b> a conical <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> from a pressure swirl atomizer was conducted by using a Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system. The variation of wavelength, wave speed and amplitude <b>of</b> wave versus <b>liquid</b> pressure was obtained. The {{results indicate that the}} cone half angle increases with liquid pressure. The stripped half wavelength liquid fragment seems to break into a series of drops immediately and no obvious contraction from liquid fragment to ligament is seen. The recorded images also show that both short and long wavelength waves exist simultaneously, and influence the breakup <b>of</b> the conical <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet.</b> The result <b>of</b> this study is useful for the purpose of developing and verifying the atomization model of spray produced by a pressure swirl atomizer...|$|R
