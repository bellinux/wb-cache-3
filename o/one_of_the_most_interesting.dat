5|$|The first volcanoes {{along the}} Juan de Fuca ridge, {{including}} Axial Seamount, were {{detected in the}} 1970s by satellite altimetry. Axial Seamount's proximity to the western coast and shallow depth make {{it one of the}} most easily accessible seamounts in the world, and its unique geological setting and active state also makes it <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>interesting,</b> rivaling Davidson Seamount to the south in scientific interest.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{official}} guidelines {{yet on the}} use of disease-modifying oral treatments due to their recent development. While some believe that they will probably reduce the usage of first-line treatments the long-term safety of interferons and glatiramer acetate will probably slow this trend. It has been recommended that at the moment oral treatments should be mainly offered in those cases where patients do not use existing treatments due to needle phobia or other reasons such as perceived inefficacy of interferons and glatiramer acetate. They could also be used in patients taking natalizumab who have developed JC virus antibodies and are therefore at an increased risk of PML. Dimethyl fumarate is potentially <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>interesting</b> oral drugs due to the long term data from use in psoriasis which points towards a very good safety profile.|$|E

25|$|Today, Arap Camii is {{the largest}} mosque on the Galata side of the Golden Horn.

25|$|By neutron {{irradiation}} of objects {{it is possible}} to induce radioactivity; this activation of stable isotopes to create radioisotopes is the basis of neutron activation analysis. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>interesting</b> objects which has been studied in this way is the hair of Napoleon's head, which have been examined for their arsenic content.|$|E
25|$|Benjamin Franklin Joslyn {{was known}} as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>interesting</b> gun {{designers}} during the U.S. Civil War, but he was known more for his constant clashes with sub-contractors and the Federal Government than he was {{for the quality of}} his arms.

40|$|The {{changing}} {{relationship between}} humans and animals through time is arguably <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> complex problems that face archaeologists today, and it is probably {{for this reason that}} only a few researchers have attempted to study this area.

25|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>interesting</b> Martello towers is Meelick Martello Tower at Clonahenoge, County Offaly, {{guarding}} the Shannon river crossing to Meelick, County Galway. As this tower supports three guns (unlike the normal Martello tower which is circular on plan and carries only one gun), it is cam shaped on plan. Currently a rampant growth of ivy covers the tower.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>interesting</b> {{things to}} be found near the city Dehloran is a natural liquid tar spring.

Interesting things around this area include mineral water springs, native trees, and bat caves with rare species of bats.|$|E
25|$|And finally {{when looking}} at the three most {{primitive}} insects with aquatic nymphs (called naiads: Ephemeroptera, Odonata and Plecoptera), each order has its own kind of tracheal gills that are so different from one another that they must have separate origins. This would be expected if they evolved from land-dwelling species. This means that <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>interesting</b> parts of insect evolution is what happened between the Thysanura-Pterygota split and the first flight.|$|E

25|$|The {{group of}} ecclesiastical remains at Ardfert is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>interesting</b> and {{instructive}} now existing in Ireland.

The cathedral, as it now stands, or rather as it stood before it was finally dismantled in A.D. 1641.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>interesting</b> {{examples}} of the fan vault is that over the staircase leading to the hall of Christ Church, Oxford, and here the complete conoid is displayed in its centre carried on a central column. This vault, not built until 1640, is an exceptional example of the long continuance of traditional workmanship, probably in Oxford transmitted in consequence of the late vaulting of the entrance gateways to the colleges. Fan vaulting is peculiar to England, the only example approaching it in France being the pendant of the Lady-chapel at Caudebec, in Normandy.|$|E
