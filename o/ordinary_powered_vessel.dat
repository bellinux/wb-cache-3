50|$|In canon law, {{the power}} to govern the church is divided into {{the power to}} make laws (legislative), enforce the laws (executive), and to judge based on the law (judicial). A person {{exercises}} power to govern either because the person holds an office to which the law grants governing power or because someone with governing power has delegated it to the person. <b>Ordinary</b> <b>power</b> is the former, while the latter is delegated power. The office with <b>ordinary</b> <b>power</b> could possess the governing <b>power</b> itself (proper <b>ordinary</b> <b>power)</b> or instead it could have the <b>ordinary</b> <b>power</b> of agency, the inherent power to exercise someone else's <b>power</b> (vicarious <b>ordinary</b> <b>power).</b>|$|R
50|$|Many {{officers}} possess <b>ordinary</b> <b>power</b> but, due {{to their}} lack of <b>ordinary</b> executive <b>power,</b> are not called ordinaries. The best example of this phenomenon is the office of judicial vicar, a.k.a. officialis. The judicial vicar only has authority through his office to exercise the diocesan bishop's power to judge cases. Though the vicar has vicarious <b>ordinary</b> judicial <b>power,</b> {{he is not an}} ordinary because he lacks <b>ordinary</b> executive <b>power.</b> A vicar general, however, has authority through his office to exercise the diocesan bishop's executive power. He is therefore an ordinary because of this vicarious <b>ordinary</b> executive <b>power.</b>|$|R

Therefore, these devices cannot function as one-port amplifiers or have the other capabilities of negative differential resistances.|$|R

40|$|This paper explores an idea {{to extend}} Newton–Raphson power flow problem to handle power system {{transmission}} line flow limits, by means of generation redispatch and phase shifters. We extend and reformulate the power flow so that it includes a variety of flow limits (thermal, small-signal stability, voltage difference), generation redispatch, and phase shifters. The novelty of the approach is three step procedure (in case any limit violations exist in the system) : run <b>ordinary</b> <b>power</b> flow (and identify flow limits violated), solve a set of linear equations using extended power flow Jacobian by adding a new column and a new raw that characterize particular limit, and resolve <b>ordinary</b> <b>power</b> flow with initial solution obtained after the correction made by solution of linear equations. The use of <b>ordinary</b> <b>power</b> flow Jacobian and minimal extensions {{to it in the}} case of limits identified makes this approach an attractive alternative for practical use.

50|$|The law vesting <b>ordinary</b> <b>power</b> {{could either}} be ecclesiastical law, i.e. the {{positive}} enactments {{that the church}} has established for itself, or divine law, i.e. the laws which the church believes were given to it by God. As an example of divinely instituted ordinaries, Catholics in communion with the Holy See believe that when Jesus established the Church He also established the episcopate and the Primacy of Simon Peter, endowing the offices with power to govern the Church. Thus, in the Catholic Church, the office of successor of Simon Peter {{and the office of}} diocesan bishop possess their <b>ordinary</b> <b>power</b> {{even in the absence of}} positive enactments from the Church.|$|R

25|$|Technologies {{that contributed}} to the {{collapse}} of Atlantic Cod include engine <b>power</b> <b>vessels</b> and frozen food compartments aboard ships. Engine <b>power</b> <b>vessels</b> had larger nets, larger engines, and better navigation. The capacity to catch fish became limitless. In addition, sonar technology gave an edge to catching and detecting fish. Sonar was originally developed during World War II to locate enemy submarines, but was later applied to locating schools of fish. These new technologies, as well as bottom-trawlers that destroyed entire ecosystems, contributed to the collapse of Atlantic Cod. They were vastly different from old techniques used, such as hand lines and long lines.|$|R
