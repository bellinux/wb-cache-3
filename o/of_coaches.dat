By the 1962 season, Banks hoped to return to shortstop but the College <b>of</b> <b>Coaches</b> had determined that he would remain at first base indefinitely. In May 1962, Banks was hit in the head by a fastball from former Cubs pitcher Moe Drabowsky and was taken off the field unconscious. He sustained a concussion, spent two nights in a hospital, sat out a Monday game, and hit three home runs and a double on Tuesday.|$|E

5|$|After the wins in Germany, Vijender's {{training}} for the Olympics continued in Patiala where Indian boxers going to the Olympics held a camp.

The Indian Amateur Boxing Federation (IABF) sent a videographer to shoot extensively the bouts involving the likely opponents of the five Indian boxers. A team <b>of</b> <b>coaches</b> went through the video footage shot by videographer Sambhu of the National Institute of Sports, Patiala, and studied the technique of the boxers from various countries in detail, so as to prepare Vijender and the others regarding the opponent's manoeuvres and fighting techniques.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBased on the {{principle}} of oxygen consumption, relationship between heat release rate <b>of</b> <b>coach</b> fire and ventilation factor is studied. The peak heat release rate <b>of</b> <b>coach</b> fire is estimated under four typical ventilation conditions: one window, two windows, four windows and all windows <b>of</b> the fire <b>coach</b> are opened, respectively. Results were compared with the predictions by traditional empirical formulas for flashover in confined space. A suitable calculation method for forecasting the heat release rate <b>of</b> <b>coach</b> fire is presented. CFD means were also applied to simulate and analyze the impact of the ventilation factor on the burning characteristics <b>of</b> <b>coach</b> fire. The results indicate that the calculation method can predict the heat release rate <b>of</b> <b>coach</b> fire well. The peak heat release rate <b>of</b> <b>coach</b> fire is proportional to the ventilation factor. The calculation results are 6. 3 MW, 8. 4 MW, 12. 6 MW and 39. 7 MW and simulation results are 6. 5 MW, 9. 9 MW, 14. 8 MW and 39 MW respectively under different ventilation conditions in this study. The results also show that the heat release rate and <b>of</b> <b>coach</b> fire increases with the increase of ventilation factor...|$|R
30|$|This {{two-stage}} study {{seeks to}} answer the following research questions. How is coaching defined? What is the aim <b>of</b> <b>coaching?</b> Who are involved in coaching? What coaching outcomes are expected? During the first stage, the definitions <b>of</b> <b>coaching</b> are extracted from the literature and analyzed to identify the distinctive features <b>of</b> <b>coaching.</b> During the second stage, the experts are interviewed to explore the views <b>of</b> practitioners in <b>coaching</b> about a place <b>of</b> <b>coaching</b> in organizations. Literature review, content analysis and comparative analysis are used {{for the purposes of this}} study. Triangulation of research results is obtained through cross verification from two sources.|$|R
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this paper are twofold. First, we argue that the rationalistic assumptions on which dominant conceptions <b>of</b> the <b>coaching</b> process rest are rather unrealistic. We therefore hold that they have relatively limited potential either for a theoretical understanding <b>of</b> <b>coaching</b> or for guiding practitioners. Second, we tentatively offer the alternative metaphor of ‘orchestration’, derived from research on the management of complex change, as one starting point for developing a more realistic conception <b>of</b> <b>coaching.</b> We assert that this way <b>of</b> thinking about <b>coaching</b> has greater potential {{as a basis for}} future research and theorising, with the longer-term aim of informing efforts to improve the practice <b>of</b> <b>coaching</b> and <b>of</b> <b>coach</b> education...|$|R
5|$|Along with Lou Holtz, Parseghian {{served as}} one of two honorary coaches in Notre Dame's 2007 spring game, an annual {{scrimmage}} held in April. Holtz's Gold team defeated Parseghian's Blue team, 10–6. The same year, Notre Dame unveiled a statue in Parseghian's honor by sculptor Jerry McKenna, depicting players carrying him off the field in triumph following the 1971 Cotton Bowl victory over Texas. In 2011, Miami also unveiled a statue in his honor {{to add to the}} RedHawks' Cradle <b>of</b> <b>Coaches</b> plaza. It shows him wearing a Notre Dame sweater as he kneels and looks ahead to the field.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} switch <b>of</b> <b>coaches,</b> Thorpe {{indicated}} that he would put more focus on improving his sprinting ability. He thus dropped the 800m freestyle despite being the reigning world champion and record holder. During this period, his times in the 400m and 200m freestyle deteriorated, and both he and Menzies were criticised. The criticism continued to mount during their partnership, particularly during the build-up to the 2004 Olympics. Following his victory in the 200 and 400 events in Athens, Thorpe said that his results justified his decision, despite posting substantially faster times as a young swimmer under Frost.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Norwich {{railway station}} had opened in 1844. Although many Norwich {{residents}} {{were reluctant to}} use the railway, and goods carriers initially found it more convenient to continue to collect goods from the coaching inns, as railway usage gradually increased the number <b>of</b> <b>coaches</b> and carts calling at the inns slowly dwindled, reducing congestion. In 1899 the Angel inn—renamed the Royal Hotel in 1840 {{on the occasion of}} Queen Victoria's wedding—finally closed, and was replaced with George Skipper's Royal Arcade, a shopping centre in the Art Nouveau style.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} value <b>of</b> <b>coaching</b> in organisations. Assessing the impact <b>of</b> <b>coaching</b> through typical {{effectiveness}} measures may identify measurable outcomes, but risks missing {{the contribution of}} intangible and unplanned outcomes. Using grounded theory methodology, this qualitative study amalgamated perspectives on the value <b>of</b> <b>coaching</b> from 29 employees comprising coachees, line managers and organisational decision-makers across public and private sector organisations. The findings suggest that intangible personal outcomes <b>of</b> <b>coaching</b> could be playing {{a pivotal role in}} helping organisations achieve their people strategies, in particular leadership development and employee engagement...|$|R
30|$|While the {{published}} research tends to focus heavily on individual level outcomes, the importance <b>of</b> <b>coaching</b> for groups and teams has been asserted previously (Arakawa and Greenberg 2007). Despite these assertions, the impact <b>of</b> <b>coaching</b> {{at the level}} of the group, team, organisation or system has largely been ignored. The limited research that does exist in this area has focused mostly on return for investment (Feggetter 2007; McGovern et al. 2001; Palmer 2003). The impact <b>of</b> <b>coaching</b> for leadership development on broader organisational measures such as collaboration, communication flow, relationships and the wellbeing of others in a system, has been left empirically untested. If the wellbeing of organisational members is of any importance, this focus must shift. Focusing on the broader organisational impacts <b>of</b> <b>coaching</b> may provide a deeper understanding <b>of</b> <b>coaching,</b> at both the individual and organisational levels, and give greater clarity on the role <b>of</b> <b>coaching</b> in the process of effective organisational change.|$|R
