Large non-anchored {{welded steel}} <b>oil</b> <b>tanks</b> are {{important}} equipments that are renowned for their extremely large structures, they {{are vulnerable to}} elephant’s foot buckling failure which can cause serious damages in seismic. Generally, locations of tank openings are at the first layer of shell course which are just close to elephant’s foot buckling position of <b>oil</b> <b>tanks.</b> While learning the effect of openings on elephant’s foot buckling of <b>oil</b> <b>tanks,</b> the welding residual deformation {{was assumed to be}} initial geometric imperfections. Numerical simulation method was adopted to analyze the effect of three factors (<b>oil</b> <b>tanks</b> with or without openings, opening sizes and opening positions) on elephant’s foot buckling critical load of <b>oil</b> <b>tanks.</b> Results show that the openings and reinforcement plates are beneficial to the increase of buckling critical load; the size and location of the openings have little effect on the buckling critical load...|$|R
5|$|Caio Duilios {{career was}} uneventful. She spent her first {{two decades in}} service with the Active and Reserve Squadrons, {{primarily}} tasked with training maneuvers and exercises. She was withdrawn from front-line duty in 1902 and thereafter employed as a training ship, though this role only lasted until 1909 when she was converted into a floating <b>oil</b> <b>tank</b> and renamed GM40. The ship's ultimate fate is unknown.|$|E

These were {{followed}} in 1873 {{by the first}} oil-tank steamer, Vaderland, which was built by Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company for Belgian owners. The vessel's use was curtailed by U.S. and Belgian authorities citing safety concerns.

5|$|Valiant {{was paid}} off in 1885, and she was {{assigned}} to the HMS Indus stoker training establishment in 1897, briefly losing her name, before being renamed as Indus IV in 1904. The ship was converted to a kite balloon storeship in 1915, during World War I, and her name was changed to HMS Valiant III. She was offered for sale in 1922, but there were no takers so the ship was converted into a floating <b>oil</b> <b>tank</b> in 1926 and towed to Hamoaze.|$|E
5|$|The E-4 variant {{was fitted}} with {{external}} bomb racks also {{and the empty}} bomb bay space was filled with an 835L (221US gal) tank for aviation fuel and a further 115L (30US gal) <b>oil</b> <b>tank.</b> This increased the loaded weight but increased range to 1,800km (1,130mi). The modifications allowed the He 111 to perform both long- and short-range missions. The E-4's eight internal vertically aligned bomb racks could each carry a 250kg (550lb) bomb. The last E Variant, the He 111E-5, was powered by the Jumo 211A-3, and retained the 835L (221US gal) fuel tank {{on the port side}} of the bomb bay. Only a few of the E-4 and E-5 were built.|$|E
5|$|The ship's {{construction}} {{period was}} very lengthy, beginning in August 1881 and completing in February 1888. She was quickly rendered obsolescent {{by the new}} pre-dreadnought battleships being laid down and, as a result, her career was limited. She spent her career alternating between the Active and Reserve Squadrons, where she took part in training exercises each year {{with the rest of}} the fleet. The ship was stricken from the naval register in 1909 and converted into a floating <b>oil</b> <b>tank.</b> She was used in this capacity until 1943, when she was sunk by bombs during World War II.

5|$|At 03:13, U-156 {{attacked}} the Texaco-owned tanker SS Arkansas which was berthed at Eagle Beach {{next to the}} Arend/Eagle Refinery. Just one of the torpedoes struck Arkansas and partially sank her but the damage was moderate and caused no casualties. Commander Hartenstein then steamed further around Aruba and directed his men {{to take to the}} deck guns and prepare for a naval bombardment of the large <b>oil</b> <b>tank</b> of the Lago Oil and Transport Company The crew of the 10.5 cm SK L/45 naval gun forgot to remove the tampion from the barrel, so when Hartenstein ordered them to fire, the gun blew up. Gunnery Officer Dietrich von dem Borne was wounded badly, one foot having been severed. His comrade and trigger man Heinrich Büssinger was badly wounded as well and died several hours after the attack. Hartenstein ordered the 3.7cm flak gun to continue the attack, causing only superficial damage.|$|E
5|$|In February 1942, {{following}} the squadron's transfer to Columbia Army Air Base in January, Farrow volunteered {{to participate in}} the Doolittle Raid, an attempt to retaliate against the Japanese {{as a result of their}} attack on Pearl Harbor. At the time, however, the mission was secret and its target unknown to the volunteers. On 1 April 1942, after training in various places around the United States, the crews and their respective aircraft departed from San Francisco aboard the USS Hornet (CV-8). The mission took place on 18 April. The B-25 which Farrow piloted, named Bat out of Hell, was the sixteenth and final aircraft to depart from the Hornet. After the aircraft's targets in Nagoya, which included an <b>oil</b> <b>tank</b> and aircraft factory, had been bombed, Farrow intended to land in Chuchow. However, the Japanese had deactivated the beacon that Farrow was using for direction.|$|E

With a wingman, Marseille bounced the Kittyhawks. After he downed one of the Australian pilots, Flying Officer Graham Pace in AL172, Marseille's Bf 109 took hits in the <b>oil</b> <b>tank</b> and propeller, likely from Flying Officer Geoff Chinchen, who reported damaging one of the Messerschmitts. Marseille nevertheless managed to shoot down another Kittyhawk (Sergeant Colin McDiarmid; AK855), before nursing his overheating aircraft back to base. The repairs to Marseille's Bf 109 took two days. The aerial victories were recorded as numbers 57–58.|$|E

5|$|Some early T-26 {{tanks were}} {{repaired}} in tank units or factories {{with the use}} of later production parts. This meant replacing the all-rubber road wheels (except the front wheels) and track idlers with new strengthened ones. Armour was added for the headlight, the armour thickness of the driver's hatch lower door of the twin-turreted tanks was increased from 6 to 10mm and armoured PT-1 or PTK observation devices were installed. A common hatch above the engine, <b>oil</b> <b>tank,</b> and fuel tank was mounted starting in May 1940. In 1940, 255 T-26s were modernised in this way and {{in the first half of}} 1941 another 85 tanks were improved. A central factory responsible for the T-26's repair and modernisation was the Factory of Carrying-and-Conveying Machines named after S. Kirov in Leningrad, and the Factory No. 105 named after L. Kaganovich in Khabarovsk from the beginning of the Great Patriotic War until 1945.|$|E
5|$|The P-4 {{contained}} {{many changes}} from the P-2 and P-3. The jettisonable loads {{were capable of}} considerable variation. Two external SC 1800kg (3,960lb) bombs, two LMA air-dropped anti-shipping mines, one SC 1,800kg plus four SC 250kg; or one SC 2,500kg external bomb could be carried on an ETC Rüstsatz rack. Depending on the load variation, an 835 L fuel and 120 L <b>oil</b> <b>tank</b> could be added {{in place of the}} internal bomb bay. The armament consisted of three defensive MG 15 machine guns. later supplemented by a further three MG 15s and one MG 17 machine gun. The radio communications were standard FuG X(10), Peil G V direction finding and FuBI radio devices. Due to the increase in defensive firepower, the crew numbers increased from four to five. The empty weight of the P-4 increased to 6,775kg (14,936lb), and the full takeoff weight increased to 13,500kg (29,762lb) owing to the mentioned alterations.|$|E
5|$|Wichita {{continued}} to provide gunfire support {{throughout the rest}} of the month. On 27 April, a small caliber shell penetrated a fuel <b>oil</b> <b>tank</b> five feet below the waterline. After temporary repairs while still off Okinawa proved unsuccessful, Wichita returned to Kerama Retto where the damage was repaired on 29–30 April. Wichita then returned to the gun line. On 12 May, the ship was damaged by friendly fire. A 5inch round struck the port aircraft catapult; shell fragments hit the shield of an antiaircraft director, killing one man and injuring eleven others. She departed the area to rest and refit at Leyte, returning to Okinawa on 18 June. Wichita {{continued to}} provide gunfire support to the troops on Okinawa through July, as part of Task Unit 2. On 15 August, the ship's crew received word that the war with Japan was over. Wichita was awarded 13 battle stars for her service during World War II.|$|E

5|$|Starting in 1895, Enrico Dandolo was {{extensively}} modernized, {{receiving an}} entirely new armament and new engines, {{as well as a}} second military mast. Caio Duilio received a much more limited refit in 1900, primarily receiving a large number of secondary guns. The Navy decided against rebuilding her along the same lines as Enrico Dandolo due to the prohibitive cost of the project. In 1902, Caio Diulio was removed from front-line service and thereafter employed as a training ship. Enrico Dandolo followed her in 1905 for service as a gunnery training vessel. In 1909, Caio Duilio was stricken from the naval register, disarmed, and converted into a floating <b>oil</b> <b>tank.</b> Her ultimate fate is unknown. Enrico Dandolo continued on in service for a few more years, first becoming a guard ship at Tobruk, Libya in 1913. After Italy entered World War I in May 1915, she was transferred to Brindisi and later Venice, where she continued guard ship duties. She was stricken in January 1920 and broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Three days later, on 26 April, Ball scored another double victory, flying S.E.5 no.A4850, and {{one more}} on 28 April. This last day's {{fighting}} left the S.E.5 so battered by enemy action that it was dismantled and sent away for repair. The following month, despite continual problems with jamming guns in the S.E.5s, Ball shot down seven Albatroses in five days, including two reconnaissance models on 1 May, a reconnaissance plane and an Albatros D.III fighter on 2 May; a D.III on 4 May, and two D.IIIs the next day, 5 May. The second of these victims nearly rammed Ball as they shot {{it out in a}} head-on firing pass. As they sped past one another, Ball was left temporarily blinded by oil spraying from the holed <b>oil</b> <b>tank</b> of his craft.
