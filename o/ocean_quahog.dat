2500|$|Pteropods {{and brittle}} stars both form {{the base of}} the Arctic food webs and are both seriously damaged from acidification. Pteropods shells {{dissolve}} with increasing acidification and the brittle stars lose muscle mass when re-growing appendages. For pteropods to create shells they require aragonite which is produced through carbonate ions and dissolved calcium. Pteropods are severely affected because increasing acidification levels have steadily decreased the amount of water supersaturated with carbonate which is needed for aragonite creation. Arctic waters are changing so rapidly that they will become undersaturated with aragonite as early as 2016. Additionally the brittle star's eggs die within a few days when exposed to expected conditions resulting from Arctic acidification. Acidification threatens to destroy Arctic food webs from the base up. Arctic food webs are considered simple, meaning there are few steps in the food chain from small organisms to larger predators. For example, pteropods are [...] "a key prey item of a number of higher predators – larger plankton, fish, seabirds, whales". Both pteropods and sea stars serve as a substantial food source and their removal from the simple food web would pose a serious threat to the whole ecosystem. The effects on the calcifying organisms at {{the base of the}} food webs could potentially destroy fisheries. The value of fish caught from US commercial fisheries in 2007 was valued at $3.8billion and of that 73% was derived from calcifiers and their direct predators. Other organisms are directly harmed as a result of acidification. For example, decrease in the growth of marine calcifiers such as the American lobster, <b>ocean</b> <b>quahog,</b> and scallops means there is less shellfish meat available for sale and consumption. Red king crab fisheries are also at a serious threat because crabs are calcifiers and rely on carbonate ions for shell development. Baby red king crab when exposed to increased acidification levels experienced 100% mortality after 95days. In 2006 red king cab accounted for 23% of the total guideline harvest levels and a serious decline in red crab population would threaten the crab harvesting industry. [...] Several ocean goods and services are likely to be undermined by future ocean acidification potentially affecting the livelihoods of some 400 to 800million people depending upon the emission scenario.|$|E

Amendments are not the most efficient means for updating biological reference points, and other Council FMPs are using more efficient methods.

40|$|The <b>ocean</b> <b>quahog</b> Arctica islandica is the longest-lived of all bivalve and {{molluscan}} species, animals > 100 yrs {{are common}} in many populations, and reported maximum live span is 374 yrs (Iceland population). Based on the Free Radical-Rate of Living theory by Pearl (1928) and Harman (1956) I am studying random bouts of self-induced metabolic rate depression (MRD), which will lower generation rates of reactive oxygen species. The animals induce MRD by spontaneous burrowing into the sediment and closing their shellls. This may be an energy saving and life prolonging strategy in the <b>ocean</b> <b>quahog.</b> Nitric oxide (NO) is an important signalling molecule and also a free radical of potential importance. In vertebrate cells NO has been recognized as an important parameter that controls mitochondrial respiration by directly inhibiting with the oxygen binding site of cytochrome-c oxidase activity (Boveris et al., 2001, Turrens, 2003). Nitric oxide is a proven signal molecule in invertebrates like molluscs whereas the concentration of NO in the cells and the hemolymph is dependent on its oxygenation status. I am investigating {{a model for a}} prospective role of NO in the self-induced MRD in A. islandica :when the clam buries under, hemolymph Po 2 declines in the closed shell, leading to an increase of c[NO] in the hemolymph.

40|$|The <b>ocean</b> <b>quahog,</b> Arctica islandica is the longest-lived non-colonial animal {{known to}} science. A maximum {{individual}} age of this bivalve of 405 {{years has been}} found in a population off the north western coast of Iceland. Conspicuously shorter maximum lifespan potentials (MLSPs) were recorded from other populations of A. islandica in European waters (e. g. Kiel Bay: 30 years, German Bight: 150 years) which experience wider temperature and salinity fluctuations than the clams from Iceland. The aim of my thesis was to identify possible life-prolonging physiological strategies in A. islandica and to examine the modulating effects of extrinsic factors (e. g. seawater temperature, food availability) and intrinsic factors (e. g. species-specific behavior) on these strategies. Burrowing behavior and metabolic rate depression (MRD), tissue-specific antioxidant and anaerobic capacities as well as cell-turnover (= apoptosis and proliferation) rates were investigated in A. islandica from Iceland and the German Bight. An inter-species comparison of the quahog with the epibenthic scallop Aequipecten opercularis (MLSP = 8 - 10 years) was carried out in order to determine whether bivalves with short lifespans and different lifestyles also feature a different pattern in cellular maintenance and repair. The combined effects of a low-metabolic lifestyle, low oxidative damage accumulation, and constant investment into cellular protection and tissue maintenance, appear to slow-down the process of physiological aging in A. islandica and to afford the extraordinarily long MLSP in this species. Standard metabolic rates were lower in A. islandica when compared to the shorter-lived A. opercularis. Furthermore, A. islandica regulate mantle cavity water PO 2 to mean values < 5 kPa, a PO 2 at which the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in isolated gill tissues of the clams was found to be 10 times lower than at normoxic conditions (21 kPa). Burrowing and metabolic rate depression (MRD) in Icelandic specimens were more pronounced in winter, possibly supported by low seawater temperature and food availability, and seem to be key energy-saving and life-prolonging parameters in A. islandica. The signaling molecule nitric oxide (NO) may play an important role during the onset of MRD in the <b>ocean</b> <b>quahog</b> by directly inhibiting cytochome-c-oxidase at low internal oxygenation upon shell closure. In laboratory experiments, respiration of isolated A. islandica gills was completely inhibited by chemically produced NO at low experimental PO 2 <= 10 kPa. During shell closure, mantle cavity water PO 2 decreased to 0 kPa for longer than 24 h, a state in which ROS production is supposed to subside. Compared to other mollusk species, onset of anaerobic metabolism is late in A. islandica in the metabolically reduced state. Increased accumulation of the anaerobic metabolite succinate was initially detected in the adductor muscle of the clams after 3. 5 days under anoxic incubation or in burrowed specimens. A ROS-burst was absent in isolated gill tissue of the clams following hypoxia (5 kPa) -reoxygenation (21 kPa). Accordingly, neither the activity of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), nor the specific content of the ROS-scavenger glutathione (GSH) was enhanced in different tissues of the <b>ocean</b> <b>quahog</b> after 3. 5 days of self-induced or forced hypoxia/anoxia to prepare for an oxidative burst. While reduced ROS formation compared to routine levels lowers oxidative stress during MRD and also during surfacing, the general preservation of high cellular defense and the efficient removal and replacement of damaged cells over lifetime seem to be of crucial importance in decelerating the senescent decline in tissues of A. islandica. Along with stable antioxidant protection over 200 years of age, proliferation rates and apoptosis intensities in most investigated tissues of the <b>ocean</b> <b>quahog</b> were low, but constant over 140 years of age. Accordingly, age-dependent accumulations of protein and lipid oxidation products are lower in A. islandica tissues when compared to the shorter-lived bivalve A. opercularis. The short-lived swimming scallop is a model bivalve species representing the opposite life and aging strategy to A. islandica. In this species permanently high energy throughput, reduced investment into antioxidant defense with age, and higher accumulation of oxidation products are met by higher cell turnover rates than in the <b>ocean</b> <b>quahog.</b> The only symptoms of physiological change over age ever found in A. islandica were decreasing cell turnover rates in the heart muscle over a lifetime of 140 years. This may either indicate higher damage levels and possibly ongoing loss of functioning in the heart of aging clams, or, the opposite, lower rates of cell damage and a reduced need for cell renewal in the heart tissue of A. islandica over lifetime. Basic physiological capacities of different A. islandica populations, measured at controlled laboratory conditions, could not explain considerable discrepancies in population specific MLSPs. For example, levels of tissue-specific antioxidant capacities and cell turnover rates were similarly high in individuals from the German Bight and from Iceland. Rather than genetic differences, the local impacts of environmental conditions on behavioral and physiological traits in the <b>ocean</b> <b>quahog</b> seem to be responsible for differences in population-specific MLSPs...|$|E
40|$|The <b>ocean</b> <b>quahog</b> A. islandica {{is among}} the longest-lived and slowest growing of marine {{bivalves}} with maximum ages > 300 years (e. g. Schöne et al. 2003, 2004). The animals exhibit a unique behaviour of self-induced metabolic reduction, by seemingly at random burrowing under to anoxic sediment layers (Taylor 1976). The time burrowed represents a period of deliberate metabolic reduction with heart rates suppressed to 10 % of normoxic levels (Taylor 1976). Living at a much slower pace increases individual life span (Yoon et al. 2002) and therewith the chances to participate in yet more reproduction events. However, in mammals, chronic intermittent hypoxia increases oxidative stress (Peng & Prabhakar 2003) and, both, hypoxia and oxidative stress cause functional and biochemical changes (Chi & Karliner 2004). We conjecture that chronic anoxic/oxic exposure fosters the extreme stress resistance in A. islandica. The <b>Ocean</b> <b>quahog</b> is the only animal known to deliberately induce a torpor-like state that does not serve to escape adverse conditions (like hibernation in snails and frogs) but, presumably, to prolong individual life span. This behaviour speaks for a unique level of stress competence (Diaz & Rosenberg 1995, Storey 1996, Abele 2002), presumably based on unique physiological and genetical features. Investigations of quality and plasticity of the hypoxia response and of the biochemical cue for surfacing in young and aged individuals from different populations with distinct maximum life span (Baltic, White Sea, Mid Atlantic) will provide insight into physiological and genetic mechanisms of the extraordinary stress hardiness in Arctica islandica...|$|E

This study examines productivity change in the Mid-Atlantic surfclam and <b>ocean</b> <b>quahog</b> fishery, which has been managed since 1990 using Individual Transferable Ouotas (ITQ). Productivity change is estimated through a Malmquist index from 1981 - 2008, capturing change before and after implementation of the quota system. We then decompose the index to examine changes in technical efficiency, scale efficiency, and technical change. Our findings indicate that the ITQ system has not sustained gains in vessel productivity. These results are thought to be driven by spatial changes in biomass and the inability to access more productive fishing grounds...|$|E

Sampling was performed with a hydraulic shellfish dredge utilizing a transect grid-type survey design, post-stratified to area/depth strata. Standardized tows of four minutes duration using a 121. 92 cm (48 in) wide dredge sampled approximately 83 m 2 of bottom per station. Minimum population size in numbers and biomass (meat weight) was calculated using mean quahog densities (1965 - 1977) expanded by strata a~eas. Within the surveyed regions, a standing crop of approximately 56. 6 x 10 ocean quahogs was estimated. having a biomass of 1. 5 x 106 metric tons (mt). The largest proportion of the resource (46 %) was located off Long Island, with 44 % off New Jersey and 10 % off the Delmarva Peninsula. Estimates of equilibrium yields for the Middle Atlantic quahog resource (Long Island th,'ough Delmarv~) ranged from 3, 022 to 45, 332 mt. assuming rates of instantaneous natural mortalit...|$|E
40|$|We {{compared}} six biogeographically and climatically distinct {{population of}} extremely long-lived <b>ocean</b> <b>quahog</b> Arctica islandica, for age-dependent differences in metabolic rates and antioxidant capacities (superoxide dismutase, catalase activity and total glutathione concentration). Different geographic locations, covering a temperature and salinity gradient of 3. 7 – 9. 3 °C and 20 – 35 ppt from the Norwegian coast, White Sea, Iceland, Kattegat, Kiel Bay and German Bight. The bivalve shells {{were used as}} age recorders by counting annual growth bands. Maximum lifespan in different populations varied between 30 and 192 y. The exceptionally long lifespan of A. islandica cannot be exclusively explained by a better-established antioxidant defense system. Extreme longevity observed in some North Atlantic populations seems to be grounded in its very low lifetime mass specific respiration, in combination with stable maintenance of antioxidant protection over life in mature specimens. The shorter-lived populations have the highest metabolic rates and show no metabolic response (Q 10) when warmed to higher temperature. Low and fluctuating salinity in Baltic exerts a stress, which enhances respiration rates and shortens longevity...|$|E
