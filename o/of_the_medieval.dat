5|$|Although Bosch's career flourished {{during the}} High Renaissance, {{he lived in}} an area where the beliefs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>medieval</b> Church still held moral authority.

5|$|Appeals {{from the}} local people led to the Crown agreeing in July 1402 to build an earthen rampart and towers to protect the settlement.

5|$|By {{the early}} 13th century, North Buckinghamshire had several {{religious}} houses: Bradwell Abbey (1154) is within modern Milton Keynes and Snelshall Priory (1218) is just outside it.

5|$|Consequently, {{specific}} types of horse developed, {{many of which have}} no modern equivalent.

5|$|In 2007, a {{single-storey}} {{building from}} the 1950s was demolished on Grey Friars Street giving archaeologists {{the opportunity to}} excavate and search for traces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>medieval</b> friary.

25|$|Several {{documents}} {{still exist}} {{from which the}} definitions and treatments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> headache in <b>medieval</b> Persia can be ascertained.

5|$|In Catholicism, {{there has}} been a long {{tradition}} of veneration of the heart, stemming from worship of the wounds of Jesus Christ which gained prominence from the mid sixteenth century.

5|$|In an 1878 {{article that}} Ohly called ‘epoch-making,’ Charles Graux {{proved that the}} numerals at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>medieval</b> manuscripts were {{proportional}} {{to the length of}} each work and in fact gave the total number of a fixed unit equal to a Homeric line.

5|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>medieval</b> {{walls of}} Mdina were {{gradually}} dismantled between the 1530s and 1720s, when the city's fortifications were being upgraded by the Hospitallers. One {{of the most}} significant visible remnants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>medieval</b> fortifications is the Greeks Gate and the surrounding curtain walls, which still retains its medieval form apart from the outer portal which was built in the 18th century. Parts of the double walls, including the remains of two gun loops, still stand between the gate and the Torre dello Standardo. Most of the northern and eastern walls date back to the medieval period, although some sections were rebuilt by the Hospitallers. The northern ramparts contain a medieval wall tower, while the remains of Byzantine antemurals and the foundations of a late 15th-century artillery platform have been found in the eastern walls.|$|E
5|$|Scholars <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>medieval</b> Islamic {{world who}} wrote on biology {{included}} al-Jahiz (781–869), Al-Dīnawarī (828–896), who wrote on botany, and Rhazes (865–925) who wrote on anatomy and physiology. Medicine was especially well studied by Islamic scholars working in Greek philosopher traditions, while natural history drew heavily on Aristotelian thought, especially in upholding a fixed hierarchy of life.|$|E
