500|$|In 1872, {{around two}} {{thousand}} white buffalo hunters working between Wichita, Kansas, and Arkansas were killing buffalo for their hides {{by the many}} thousands. [...] Acres of land were dedicated solely for drying the hides of the slaughtered buffalo. Native Americans protested at the [...] "wanton destruction" [...] of their food supply. By 1874, 3,700,000 bison had been destroyed on the western and southern plains of the United States. Concern {{for the destruction of}} the buffalo mounted, and a bill in Congress was passed, HR 921, that would have made buffalo hunting illegal for whites. Taking advice from Secretary Delano, Grant chose to pocket-veto the bill, believing that the demise of the buffalo would reduce Indian wars and force tribes to stay on their respected reservations and to adapt an agricultural lifestyle rather than roaming the plains and hunting buffalo. Ranchers wanted the buffalo gone to <b>open</b> <b>pasture</b> <b>land</b> for their cattle herds. With the buffalo food supply lowered, Native Americans were forced to stay on reservations.|$|E
60|$|It {{was with}} such {{feelings}} that I eyed {{the approach of}} the new coach, lately established on our road, and known by the name of the Somerset, which, to say truth, possesses some interest for me, even when it conveys no such important information. The distant tremulous sound of its wheels was heard just as I gained the summit of the gentle ascent, called the Goslin-brae, from which you command an extensive view down the valley of the river Gander. The public road, which comes up the side of that stream, and crosses it at a bridge {{about a quarter of a}} mile from the place where I was standing, runs partly through enclosures and plantations, and partly through <b>open</b> <b>pasture</b> <b>land.</b> It is a childish amusement perhaps,--but my life has been spent with children, and why should not my pleasures be like theirs?--childish as it is then, I must own I have had great pleasure in watching {{the approach of the}} carriage, where the openings of the road permit it to be seen. The gay glancing of the equipage, its diminished and toy-like appearance at a distance, contrasted with the rapidity of its motion, its appearance and disappearance at intervals, and the progressively increasing sounds that announce its nearer approach, have all to the idle and listless spectator, who has nothing more important to attend to, something of awakening interest. The ridicule may attach to me, which is flung upon many an honest citizen, who watches from the window of his villa the passage of the stage-coach; but it is a very natural source of amusement notwithstanding, and many of those who join in the laugh are perhaps not unused to resort to it in secret.|$|E

40|$|International audienceInformation on past {{land cover}} {{in terms of}} {{absolute}} areas of different landscape units (forest, <b>open</b> <b>land,</b> <b>pasture</b> <b>land,</b> cultivated land, etc.) at local to regional scales is needed to test hypotheses and answer questions related to climate change (e. g. feedbacks effects of land-cover change), archaeological research, and nature conservancy (e. g. management strategy). The palaeoecological technique best suited to achieve quantitative reconstruction of past vegetation is pollen analysis. A simulation approach developed by Sugita (the computer model POLLSCAPE) which uses models based on the theory of pollen analysis is presented together with examples of application. POLLSCAPE has been adopted as the central tool for POLLANDCAL (POLlen/LANdscape CALibration), an international research network focusing on this topic. The theory behind models of the pollen-vegetation relationship and POLLSCAPE is reviewed. The two model outputs which receive greatest attention in this paper are the relevant source area of pollen (RSAP) and pollen loading in mires and lakes. Six examples of application of POLLSCAPE are presented, each of which explores a possible use of the POLLANDCAL tools and a means of validating or evaluating the models with empirical data. The landscape and vegetation factors influencing {{the size of the}} RSAP, the importance of pollen productivity estimates (PPEs) for the model outputs, the detection of small and rare patches of plant taxa in pollen records, and quantitative reconstructions of past vegetation and landscapes are discussed {{on the basis of these}} examples. The simulation approach is seen to be useful both for exploring different vegetation/ landscape scenarios and for refuting hypotheses...|$|R

50|$|During this twenty-year period, <b>open</b> <b>pastures</b> were {{cultivated}} in the Hokkaido region of northern Japan {{in an effort}} to attract more people to the area for agricultural development. Over forty-five thousand households immigrated to the Hokkaido region, but only 28.6% stayed. Most of the cultivated <b>pasture</b> <b>land</b> was abandoned and returned to the Japanese government from 1966-1977, as climate conditions in the area were not conducive to good crop yield. The shift from old growth forest to pasture left large areas of reduced soil fertility that trees were unable to recolonize. Due to a lack of a seed bank and competition with dwarf bamboo, human involvement was necessary to reforest the area. From 1978-2005 native trees with high growth rates were planted in plantations. It was mostly conifers that were planted in the area, but it has aided in the recovery of a conifer-broadleaf mixed forest.|$|R
50|$|In late 1999, due to {{a steady}} growth in the {{district}}, school district officials sought out community and district opinion regarding building a brand new, {{state of the art}} high school building on <b>open</b> <b>pasture</b> <b>land</b> next to the current high school at the time. In the Spring of 2000, voters approved the bond issue to build a brand new high school at the price of 7 million dollars. Construction began in Summer of 2002 and was opened for classes in Fall of 2004, with the capacity to house 550 students. The old high school became the district's middle school and a new baseball facility was constructed behind the new school and was finished a full year before the new school was. In addition to much bigger classrooms, the new school houses a gymnasium with 3 basketball courts and seating for 1,200 fans, the capacity to host basketball play-off games, a new fine arts auditorium and a vast library.|$|E

50|$|Adriaen did {{not want}} to become a marine painter so he was trained in the studio of Jan Wynants, the {{landscape}} painter. There he made the acquaintance of Philip Wouwerman, who is believed to have aided him in his studies of animals, and to have exercised a powerful and beneficial influence upon his art. Having made exceptionally rapid progress, he was soon employed by his master to introduce figures into his landscape compositions, and he rendered a similar service to Hobbema, Ruisdael, Verboom and other contemporary artists.According to Houbraken, he died while in collaboration with Jan van der Heyden and Frederik de Moucheron, painting animals on their paintings.His favourite subjects were scenes of <b>open</b> <b>pasture</b> <b>land,</b> with sheep, cattle and goats, which he executed with dexterity, with much precision of touch and truth of draughtsmanship, and with clear silvery colouring. He painted a few small winter scenes with skaters, and several religious subjects, such as the Descent from the Cross, for a Roman Catholic hidden church in Amsterdam and The Migration of Jacob (1663, Wallace Collection).|$|E
50|$|The Union men faced a {{formidable}} task.

They experienced devastating fire from Stephen Lee's batteries and then withering volleys from the infantrymen in the line. Nevertheless, {{they were able to}} break the Confederate line, routing the 48th Virginia Infantry. The Stonewall Brigade rushed in to restore the line, taking heavy casualties, including its commander, Col. Baylor. In what was arguably the most famous incident of the battle, Confederates in Col. Bradley T. Johnson's and Col. Leroy A. Stafford's brigades fired so much that they ran out of ammunition and resorted to throwing large rocks at the 24th New York, causing occasional damage, and prompting some of the surprised New Yorkers to throw them back. To support Jackson's exhausted defense, which was stretched to the breaking point, Longstreet's artillery added to the barrage against Union reinforcements attempting to move in, cutting them to pieces.|$|E
40|$|In sub-Saharan Africa, {{including}} Uganda, {{there is}} declining soil fertility and limited on-farm use of inorganic fertilizers due to poverty and limited subsidies for inorganic fertilizer use. Thus, integration of soil fertility improving tree species (SFITs) in farming systems remains a plausible option to sustaining soil productivity. However, {{knowledge of the}} effects of many of the locally growing farmer perceived soil fertility enhancing tree species on to soil chemical and nutrient contents are thus still lacking, and this has constrained decisions on their adoption and scaling up. The objectives of this paper were to identify farmers' preferred soil fertility improving tree species in agropastoral communities of Kyeizooba subcounty Bushenyi district, and characterize their litter content and assess their effect on selected soil chemical properties. Semistructured questionnaires were administered to 333 randomly selected agropastoral farmers. Litter and soils under canopy soils were sampled from three different environments: Under canopy radius (A), canopy edge (B), <b>open</b> <b>pasture</b> <b>land</b> up to thrice the canopy radius (C). Results revealed Eucalyptus as the most common tree species on livestock farms, followed by Erythrina abyssinica. The highest litter content was recorded for Markhamia lutea (240 [*]g/cm 2 under its canopy) followed by Croton macrostachyus (90 [*]g/cm 2), and 19 [*]g/cm 2 Erythrina abyssinica. Nitrogen was higher (P=. 02) in Erythrina abyssinica litter, K and carbon in Croton macrostachyus litter (P=. 03). These results give evidence that of soil improvers Erythrina abyssinica, Croton macrostachyus, and Markhamia lutea may positively affect soil fertility. Farmers' indigenous knowledge and or valuation of important tree species can be relied on, and thus, their indigenous knowledge need to be incorporated during identification of tree species for promotion in farming systems...|$|E

40|$|These {{observations}} {{were made in}} Estancia Curupicay, a cattle ranch, some 12 miles from Mercedes, and situated nearly in {{the centre of the}} province of Corrientes. The ranch consists of <b>open</b> <b>pasture</b> <b>land,</b> with few native trees except along the streams. It has many exotics such as casuarinas, Eucalyptus and paraísos planted round the administration buildings and in scattered groups to give shade to the cattle. The Shiny Cowbird (Molothrus bonariensis), is abundant in all the district. The Crowned Slaty-Flycatcher (Empidonomus aurantio-atro-cristatus), was recorded once feeding a fledgling Shiny Cowbird (7 January 1975). The Hornero (Fumarius rufus), is also here in numbers, nine nests being the aproximate number built in the gardens of the ranch each year. Horneros have been observed feeding young Cowbirds since 1973, in November of each year. Three pairs were seen with young parasites each spring, with two or with one, but never with any of their own brood and the young Cowbird at the same time. Great Kiskadees (Pitangus sulphuratus), have also been seen feeding young Cowbirds, so it would seems that covered neasts are no protection against brood-parasites. I have actually seen a female Cowbird go into an Horneros nest on two oceasions, and found a fallen Horneros nest with broken eggs of the owners and one Cowbird´s egg that was mottled and typical. The Rufos-collared Sparrow (Zonotrichia capensis), in common in the gardens, and nest in the privet hedges, but I have never seen them followed by young Cowbirds. The Bay winged Cowbirds come to my bird table, in company with young Screaming Cowbirds, but I have never seen a young Shiny Cowbird in their small flocks. So it would seen that brood-parasitism by the Shiny Cowbird on the Hornero is relatively common in the province of Corrientes, also on the Great Kiskadee, and that birds victimized vary according the zone. The species being different in the province of Buenos Aires to the ones that are preferred here...|$|E
