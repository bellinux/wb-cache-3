5|$|Iguanodon was {{recorded}} from Africa based on teeth from Tunisia {{and elsewhere in}} the Sahara, but the description of Lurdusaurus and Ouranosaurus cast doubt on African records of Iguanodon. The genus was also recorded from Mongolia based on the description of I. orientalis, and in North America based <b>on</b> <b>I.</b> ottingeri from Utah. Another North American species, from South Dakota, once assigned to Iguanodon as I. lakotaensis, has since been reclassified as the genus Dakotadon.|$|E

5|$|Peter Martyr Vermigli (8 September 1499 – 12 November 1562) was a Reformed theologian of the Reformation period. Born in Florence, he fled Italy {{to avoid}} the Roman Inquisition in 1542. He lectured on the Bible in Strasbourg, Zürich and at the University of Oxford. Vermigli was {{primarily}} a professor of the Bible, especially the Old Testament. His lectures <b>on</b> <b>I</b> Corinthians, Romans, Judges, Kings, Genesis, and Lamentations were turned into commentaries.|$|E
5|$|When filming {{concluded}} <b>on</b> <b>I</b> See Ice, Formby {{spent the}} 1937 summer season performing in the revue King Cheer at the Opera House Theatre, Blackpool, before appearing in a 12-minute {{slot in the}} Royal Variety Performance at the London Palladium that November. The popularity of his performances meant that in 1937 he was the top British male star in box office takings, a position he held every subsequent year until 1943. Additionally, between 1938 and 1942 {{he was also the}} highest-paid entertainer in Britain, {{and by the end of}} the 1930s was earning £100,000 a year.|$|E

Sometimes it's about the right amount of blood sugar, just slightly hungover. And I'm really affected by the weather. If it's too nice outside it's insane for me, the concept of being inside. Everybody talks about this whole technology versus nature thing and if it's anything that is it: look who my best friends are, a bunch of plastic and circuitry and electricity, when I should be running around getting chased by bumblebees.|$|E

5|$|Formby went to Normandy in July 1944 in {{the vanguard}} of a wave of ENSA performers. He and Beryl {{travelled}} over on a rough crossing to Arromanches giving a series of impromptu concerts to troops in improvised conditions, including on the backs of farm carts and army lorries, or in bomb-cratered fields. In one location the German front line was too close for him to perform, so he crawled into the trenches and told jokes with the troops there. He then boarded HMS Ambitious for his first scheduled concert before returning to France to continue his tour. During dinner with General Bernard Montgomery, whom he had met in North Africa, Formby was invited to visit the glider crews of 6th Airborne Division, who had been holding a series of bridges without relief for 56 days. He did so on 17 August in a one-day visit to the front line bridges, where he gave nine shows, all standing beside a sandbag wall, ready to jump into a slit trench in case of problems; much of the time his audience were in foxholes. After the four-week tour of France, Formby returned home to start work <b>on</b> <b>I</b> Didn't Do It (released in 1945), although he continued to work on ENSA concerts and tours in Britain. Between January and March 1945, shortly after the release of He Snoops to Conquer, he left on an ENSA tour that took in Burma, India and Ceylon (the latter is now Sri Lanka). The concerts in the Far East were his last for ENSA, {{and by the end of}} the war it was estimated that he had performed in front of three million service personnel.|$|E
