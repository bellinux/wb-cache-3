5|$|Although {{evidence}} is lacking, modern sea turtles probably descended {{from a single}} common ancestor during the Cretaceous period. Like all other sea turtles except the leatherback, loggerheads {{are members of the}} ancient family Cheloniidae, and appeared about 40 million years ago. Of the six species of living Cheloniidae, loggerheads are more closely related to the Kemp's ridley sea turtle, <b>olive</b> <b>ridley</b> sea turtle, and the hawksbill turtle than they are to the flatback turtle and the green turtle.|$|E
5|$|Jorge Antonio Pacheco Albert, Director of Civil Protection for the Port of Acapulco, {{reported}} that approximately 800 were injured during {{the passage of}} Henriette along the coast and that 337people relocated to temporary shelters. In Michoacán, Henriette damaged 10,000 square meters (107,000sq. ft) of beach near Ixtapilla, destroying approximately 5,000 <b>Olive</b> <b>Ridley</b> turtle nests, comprising 10% of the endangered species's nests in the state.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} caused {{severe damage}} to the environment; 200square miles (700km²) of low-lying rainforest and pine and evergreen oak woodlands were greatly damaged in southern Mexico. Strong waves produced severe beach erosion in some locations. The erosion affected two nesting cycles for the <b>Olive</b> <b>Ridley</b> turtle, destroying about 40million eggs. Nearly 806,000 nests were affected, and about 50% of these were wiped out. The deadliest and most intense hurricane to hit southern Mexico since 1959, the hurricane was the first documented hurricane strike on Pacific coral reefs. Crop damage was extreme, and 400,000 bags of coffee were lost. In {{the days after the}} hurricane, soybean and wheat prices increased. In all, Hurricane Pauline had a large effect on fauna in Southern Mexico.|$|E
40|$|Different organisations in India are {{actively}} engaged with sea turtle conservation programmes. According to them, minor nesting of <b>olive</b> <b>ridleys</b> occurs in Andhra Pradesh. Exporting of marine turtles {{was not reported}} in this coast but a section of fishermen known as 'Oda Baljees' eat the turtle meat. The trawlers catch a number of sea turtles, were incidentally caught in nets. Fishing nets should be specially designed to avoid incidental catch of the turtles. The sanctuary boundaries should be extended and inshore use of trawlers and fishing nets during mating and nesting season of <b>Olive</b> <b>ridleys</b> in the sanctuary should be regulated by instructing the port and fisheries departments...|$|R
50|$|Some of the <b>olive</b> <b>ridley's</b> {{foraging}} grounds near southern California are contaminated due to sewage, agricultural runoff, pesticides, solvents, {{and industrial}} discharges. These contaminants {{have been shown}} to decline the productivity of the benthic community, which negatively affects these turtles, which feed from these communities. The increasing demand to build marinas and docks near Baja California and southern California are also negatively affecting the <b>olive</b> <b>ridleys</b> in these areas, where an increase in oil and gas will be released into these sensitive habitats. Another threat to these turtles are power plants, which have documented juvenile and subadult turtles becoming entrained and entrapped within the saltwater cooling intake systems.|$|R
50|$|Despite low {{observer}} coverage, usually 5% or less, it {{was estimated}} that prior to 2001, a total of 666 turtles were caught annually in the Hawaii longline fishery: 418 loggerheads, 146 <b>olive</b> <b>ridleys,</b> 112 leatherbacks and 40 green turtles.|$|R

25|$|Despite recent {{declines in}} the sea turtle populations, five species are known to nest in Burma at well known island and {{mainland}} beaches known as turtle-banks. These are the <b>olive</b> <b>ridley</b> sea turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea), the loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta), the green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), the hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata), and the leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea).|$|E
50|$|Although <b>olive</b> <b>ridleys</b> are {{famed for}} their arribadas, {{many of the}} nesting grounds can only support {{relatively}} small to moderate-sized aggregations (about 1,000 nesting females).

40|$|Six {{species of}} sea turtles {{occur in the}} Pacific Ocean (green turtles, loggerheads, leatherbacks, hawksbills, <b>olive</b> <b>ridleys</b> and flatbacks). All species, except flatbacks, have transboundary distributions. The status of most sea turtle stocks in the Pacific Ocean is poorly understood. Some stocks are increasing, such as in eastern Australia and Hawaii. However, there is {{evidence}} that many stocks have been reduced significantly, which is mainly a result of overharvesting of eggs, subsistence or commercial harvest of large turtles and nesting habitat destruction. Incidental capture in coastal and pelagic fisheries can also be an important source of mortality for some stocks. Abundance trends for the six Pacific species of sea turtles are reviewed, using the best available quantitative information...|$|R
25|$|The Marina {{beach was}} famed for its {{pristine}} beauty, jolly ambiance, and rich ecosystems. However, {{since the middle}} of the 20th century, the beach and water have become polluted.

In recent years, many voluntary organisations have taken up the task of cleaning up the Marina and protecting the ecosystem. Particular efforts include protection of <b>olive</b> <b>ridley</b> turtle nests along the Neelankarai section of the beach.|$|E
25|$|Owing to the {{popularity}} of numerous sea turtle species, people often travel to areas where the turtles nest or live to observe and photograph them. This has resulted in numerous deaths of the turtles through boat collisions, tourists attempting to catch or steal individuals, and other incidents.

40|$|Abstract — Variability in {{satellite}} transmitter life {{has often been}} examined in terrestrial studies, however not in a marine setting. In this study, two transmitters per turtle were attached to loggerhead turtles (N= 15), green turtles (N= 2) and <b>olive</b> <b>ridleys</b> (N= 3) to see if mortality could be determined and to examine variability between tags. Factors examined in this paper were reception duration or how long we received tag data, the habitat area where transmissions stopped, and the differences between reception duration. The results show that variation in transmission reception between identical transmitters ranged widely. Five of our 20 pairs (25 %) had significant differences in duration between the tag pairs {{that could not be}} explained with normal tag variation; Four pairs had zero days difference in duration between the tag pair. Our data verifies that multiple factors need to be examined {{in order to determine the}} final outcome of tracking due to the variability in tags...|$|R

25|$|Playa Escobilla is {{considered}} to the sanctuary of the <b>Olive</b> <b>Ridley</b> turtle as {{a large number of}} these creatures arrive here to lay their eggs. It is a large green area where forest meets a lagoon. Canoe and guided tours are available to see the areas flora and fauna. The area also has a large organic farm which grows crops such as hibiscus flowers for sale, as well as a restaurant and cabins for rent. Tours generally end with visiting the turtle nests located on the beach. About once a month, up to thousands of turtles will arrive on these beaches to lay their eggs. After this occurs, there are releases of large numbers of baby turtles which have been guarded and incubated by the sanctuary volunteers.|$|E
25|$|The {{endangered}} species that {{live within the}} Sundarbans and extinct species {{that used to be}} include the royal Bengal tigers, estuarine crocodile, northern river terrapins (Batagur baska), <b>olive</b> <b>ridley</b> sea turtles, Gangetic dolphin, ground turtles, hawksbill sea turtles and king crabs (horse shoe). Some species such as hog deer (Axis porcinus), water buffalos (Bubalus bubalis), barasingha or swamp deer (Cervus duvauceli), Javan rhinoceros (Rhinoceros sondaicus), single horned rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis) and the mugger crocodiles or marsh crocodiles (Crocodylus palustris) started to become extinct in the Sundarbans towards the middle of the 20th century, because of extensive poaching and man hunting by the British. There are other threatened mammal species, such as the capped langurs (Semnopithecus pileatus), smooth-coated otters (Lutrogale perspicillata), Oriental small-clawed otters (Aonyx cinerea), and great Bengal civets (Viverra zibetha).|$|E
50|$|The habitat {{range of}} sea turtles {{in general is}} known to be far {{reaching}} into warmer temperatures and the tropical and subtropical areas of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and is even also found in warmer seas such as the Mediterranean Sea. Within these temperamental biomes, sea turtles frequent near by the coastlines when nesting, and spend most of their lives swimming out in waters over the continental shelf when feeding. Travelling throughout the oceans has been reported in <b>Olive</b> <b>Ridleys</b> Sea Turtles but more often than not, they tend to frequent bays and estuaries. The diets of all the sea turtle species, except for the Green Sea Turtle, which is only carnivorous from hatchling to juvenile, are mostly carnivorous, with some herbivorous tendencies. Turtles feed mainly on sea sponges, jellyfish, mollusks and barnacles, sea urchins, and even fish. The green sea turtle, on the other hand, feeds primarily on many different types of sea grasses.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{threatened}} species which include sea turtles like hawksbills, <b>olive</b> <b>ridleys,</b> and green turtles; humphead wrasses, giant groupers and giant clams {{are present in}} the Verde Island Passage. However, there are no enforcement of ordinances and over-fishing is common. A short-lived 'park fee' scheme for the Verde Island drop-off dive site was soon dropped when it was discovered that the revenue was being used to buy better fishing gear and hence removing fish at a higher rate. Humphead wrasses are especially threatened and divers often go years without spotting a single individual. It was particularly noted the rare red fin wrasse (Cirrhilabrus rubripinnis) thrives in Verde Island. I have personally experienced in 2014 that the tourist levy was in full operation when I landed at Puerto Galera though it is a small amount. The municipalities collect the fee and are responsible for its administration that includes support to community infrastructure around the area.|$|R
50|$|<b>Olive</b> <b>ridleys</b> {{generally}} {{begin to}} aggregate near nesting beaches {{about two months}} before nesting season, although this may vary throughout its range. In the eastern Pacific, nesting occurs throughout the year, with peak nesting events (arribadas) occurring between September and December. Nesting beaches {{can be characterized as}} relatively flat, midbeach zone, and free of debris. Beach fidelity is common, but not absolute. Nesting events are usually nocturnal, but diurnal nesting has been reported, especially during large arribadas. Exact age of sexual maturity is unknown, but this can be somewhat inferred from data on minimum breeding size. For example, the average carapace length of nesting females (n = 251) at Playa Nancite, Costa Rica was determined to be 63.3 cm, with the smallest recorded at 54.0 cm. Females can lay up to three clutches per season, but most will only lay one or two clutches. The female will remain near shore for the internesting period, which is about one month. Mean clutch size varies throughout its range and decreases with each nesting attempt.|$|R
25|$|All {{but one of}} {{the marine}} turtles come to the Mazunte area to lay their eggs, as well as a few land and {{freshwater}} turtle species. The Pacific coast town of Mazunte is famous for its sea turtles. Thousands of <b>Olive</b> <b>Ridley</b> turtles arrive en masse to lay their eggs in nearby Escobilla Bay. The nesting season generally begins in May and lasts for several months. Although an endangered species, the turtles come to the beach in large numbers for a few nights after a full moon. These events are called arribadas. Other turtles that lay eggs here are the Hawksbill turtle, the “prieta” (a subspecies of green turtle), and some leatherback turtles. In 1997, The Centro Mexicano de Tortuga counted the arrival of about 900,000 sea turtles to La Escobilla beach alone.|$|E
25|$|Marina Beach lies on {{the stretch}} of coast where <b>olive</b> <b>ridley</b> sea turtles, a species {{classified}} as Schedule 1 of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 (critically endangered), nest during mating season, chiefly between late October and April peaking from mid-January to mid-February. The Ennore–Mamallapuram zone, on which the beach lies, {{is one of the}} three major nesting grounds on the Indian coast. However, with the expansion of the shrimp trawling fishery in the eastern coast of India in the mid-1970s, several individuals of the species are washed ashore dead every year. The eggs laid by the females along the beach are also sold in the local market by the fishermen and traders. In 1977, a recovery programme was started by the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute. Many volunteer organisations in the city, such as the Students' Sea Turtle Conservation Network and the Sea Turtle Protection Force of the TREE Foundation, get involved in conservation of the species along the coast.|$|E
25|$|The faunal {{diversity}} of wild life in Tanzania in its {{national parks and}} game reserves is also dramatic. There are 310 mammal species (fourth largest in Africa); 960 species of birds (third place in Africa); and many amphibians and reptiles, which are stated to form the fourth largest population in Africa. The endangered fauna species are; the black rhino; Uluguru bushshrikes; hawksbill, green turtles, <b>olive</b> <b>ridley</b> turtle and leatherback turtles; red colobus monkeys; wild dogs; and Pemba flying foxes. However, Lonely Planet also mentions a figure of 430 species of four million animals, and 60,000 insect species, 100 species of snakes and 25 species of reptiles, 1000 species of birds. More details of fauna species {{as reported by the}} Museum of Zoology of the University of Michigan, Bucknell University, Avibase data profiles and BirdLife International data profiles are the following.

There are three species of sea snakes.There are dugongs and smaller cetaceans like finless porpoises, common dolphins, bottlenose dolphins and Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins. Larger whales such as blue whales, sei whales are seen. Humpback whales, and sperm whales may have been almost wiped out due to illegal whaling by the Soviet Union and Japan. Whale sharks {{can be found in}} deeper areas. A surprisingly large scale greater flamingo colony, reaching up to 20,000 nests is known to occur along the gulf. There are 42 islands in the Arabian Sea with coral reefs and the park is situated in one of those.|$|R
40|$|Coastal {{communities}} have exploited sea turtles for centuries. In the 1950 s, organised fisheries {{were developed to}} capture turtles {{in many parts of}} the world; sea turtles were considered an important exploitable fishery resource due to their high commercial value. Turtle meat and eggs were seell as a basic protein source for coastal populations. In India, Jacob (1973) highlighted the potential of sea turtle resources. Organised trade in turtle products existed prior to the eighties (Dattatri 1984, Rajagopalan 1984, 2000). It is estimated that 50, 000 - 80, 000 adult <b>olive</b> <b>ridleys</b> were captured off the Gahirmatha coast every nesting season up to 1981 - 82 (Das 1985). In September 1977. the five species of sea turtles that occur in Indian waters were included in Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. As a consequence of the implementation of regulatory measures, organised capture and trade decreased, though illegal trade persisted till the mid- 1980 s. While the threat from targeted capture and trade decreased, incidental capture of sea turtles in gear operated for other species of fish and shellfish has become more significant over the years. The interaction of sea turtles with fisheries has become an area of critical importance {{in many parts of the}} world (Gerosa and Casale 1999, Vivekanandan 2002). In India tOO, incidental capture in gill nets and trawls has become a serious threat to sea turtle populations (Rajagopalan et a 11996, 2001, Pandav and Choudhury 1999, Wright and Mohanty 2002). Due to an increase in the number of fishing units, and also improvement in technology, incidental bycatch has increased in recent years to the extent that it is the most significant cause of sea turtle mortality in Indian waters...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Kemp's ridley sea turtles, Lepidochelys kempi, underwent a population crash over a period of approximately thirty-five years that made them the most endangered of the sea turtle species. To understand the impact of the crash and {{to learn more about the}} life history of the Kemp's ridleys, DNA samples were obtained from adult female and hatchling turtles for microsatellite analysis. Average allele number and heterozygosity values were determined for four loci and compared with the values found in a healthy population of <b>olive</b> <b>ridleys,</b> L. olivacea, to determine if there was evidence of a significant loss of diversity as a result of the population crash. Differences in the mean heterozygosity and the mean number of alleles per locus were not significant (p>O. 1, p> 0. 25, respectively). The decline in the Kemp's ridley population does not appear to have been severe enough to affect their genetic health. Mother and offspring groups were examined at three loci for evidence of multiple paternity. In approximately 60 %, three paternal alleles were detected. There was insufficient evidence to support or refute the hypothesis of mating between nesting emergences. The power of the study to detect multiple paternity was tested using simulations. Two models, in which males contributed equally or unequally to the fertilization of the eggs, were simulated. The results indicated that the study was sensitive to the model of paternity. The best fit of the data was provided by an unequal paternity model. The study, while underestimating the actual number of nests fertilized by multiple males, does support the theory of a promiscuous mating system which would help to maintain genetic diversity in a small population...|$|R
