5|$|Rockwell workers mixed {{hazardous}} {{and other}} wastes with concrete to create one-ton solid blocks called pondcrete. These were {{stored in the}} open under tarps on asphalt pads. The pondcrete {{turned out to be}} weak storage, an <b>outcome</b> <b>that</b> had been predicted by Rockwell's own engineers. Relatively unprotected from the elements, the blocks began to leak and sag. Nitrates, cadmium and low-level radioactive waste began to leach into the ground and run downhill toward Walnut Creek and Woman Creek.|$|E
5|$|Claiming the General Assembly's {{decision}} was invalid, Taylor sued to prevent Beckham from exercising {{the authority of}} the governor's office. Beckham countersued Taylor for possession of the state capitol and governor's mansion. The suits were consolidated and heard in Jefferson County circuit court, which claimed it had no authority to interfere with the method of deciding contested elections prescribed by the state constitution, an <b>outcome</b> <b>that</b> favored Beckham. The Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld the circuit court's decision on appeal and rejected Taylor's claim that he had been deprived of property without due process by stating that an elective office was not property and thus not protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E

5|$|The pope {{referred}} {{the dispute}} to a council of English prelates, which met at Windsor during Whitsuntide in 1072. The council {{decided that the}} Archbishop of Canterbury was the superior of the Archbishop of York and further ruled that York had no rights south of the Humber River. This meant that the disputed bishoprics {{were taken from the}} province of York, an <b>outcome</b> <b>that</b> probably had the support of the King, who aimed to prevent the separation of the north from the rest of England. By depriving the Archbishop of suffragans, William limited York's power and separatist tendencies. The medieval chronicler Hugh the Chanter commented that by requiring Thomas to obey Canterbury, the King removed the threat that Thomas might crown someone else as King of England– such as the Danish king. However, the council of Windsor also ruled that York's province included Scotland. Although Thomas was required to profess obedience to Lanfranc and Lanfranc's successors, the obedience did not mention nor was held to acknowledge any primacy of Canterbury, and it did not bind Thomas' successors.|$|E

25|$|The {{high-profile}} Bosman signings of Jean-Alain Boumsong and Dado Pršo in {{the close}} season of 2004–05 gave Rangers renewed hope of regaining the title from Celtic's grasp. McLeish's {{team won the}} 2005 league title on a dramatic last day, an <b>outcome</b> <b>that</b> had looked highly unlikely after Rangers fell five points behind leaders Celtic with just four games remaining.|$|E
25|$|For some {{environmental}} effects cost-benefit analysis {{can be substituted}} with cost-effectiveness analysis. This is especially true when {{there is only one}} type of physical <b>outcome</b> <b>that</b> is sought, such as the reduction of energy use by increasing energy efficiency. Using cost-effectiveness analysis is less laborious and time-consuming as it does not involve the monetization of outcomes, which can be difficult in some cases.|$|E
25|$|The {{elections}} were scheduled for October 1963. As in 1954, the PLH was confronting a divided opposition. The PNH nominated Ramón Ernesto Cruz, but a faction split off {{and ran the}} son of ex-president Carías. The PLH ignored the wishes of their president and nominated Modesto Rodas Alvarado, a charismatic, highly partisan figure believed to be {{to the left of}} Villeda Morales. All signs pointed to an overwhelming victory for the PLH, an <b>outcome</b> <b>that</b> the military found increasingly unpalatable.|$|E

25|$|The {{game was}} washed out. Heavy rain poured {{in the day}} before, and the ground could not be dried {{sufficient}} enough for the game to start. Finally the game was called off by the Umpires' decisions without a ball being bowled due to a soggy outfield, an <b>outcome</b> <b>that</b> angered the fans who {{had been waiting for}} the game to start for five hours and they eventually started showing their frustration by hurling stones and setting fire to objects in the stands.|$|E
25|$|In response, Deng Xiaoping cited {{clearly the}} lack of room for {{compromise}} {{on the question of}} sovereignty over Hong Kong; the PRC, as the successor of Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China on the mainland, would recover the entirety of the New Territories, Kowloon and Hong Kong Island. China considered treaties about Hong Kong as unequal and ultimately refused to accept any <b>outcome</b> <b>that</b> would indicate permanent loss of sovereignty over Hong Kong's area, whatever wording the former treaties had.|$|E

25|$|The {{forecasts}} for the Senate {{proved to}} be correct for every race. But the near stalemate in Minnesota led to a recount that was settled only on June 30, 2009. In Alaska, after a protracted counting of ballots, on November 19 Republican incumbent Ted Stevens conceded the seat to Democrat Mark Begich, an <b>outcome</b> <b>that</b> Silver had forecast on election day. And in Georgia, a run-off election on December 2 led to the re-election of Republican Saxby Chambliss, a result that was also consistent with Silver's original projection.|$|E
25|$|The Carranza {{government}} was recognized de jure by the United States on 31 August 1917 {{as a direct}} consequence of the Zimmermann telegram, since recognition was necessary to ensure Mexican neutrality in World War I. After the military invasion of Veracruz in 1914, Mexico would not participate in any military excursions with the United States in World War I, thus ensuring Mexican neutrality was the best <b>outcome</b> <b>that</b> the United States could hope for, even if Mexican neutrality would allow German companies to keep their operations in Mexico open.|$|E
25|$|Word soon {{went around}} the {{publishing}} trade; after their current printers pulled Issue 4 from the presses Neville shopped around for a new printer but he was turned down by a dozen other companies until, on Sharp's advice, he approached maverick writer-publisher Francis James, editor of the Anglican Press, who agreed to take it on. When Neville, Walsh and Grose appeared in court on 3 September 1964 the Walshes' solicitor pleaded guilty on their behalf; each was fined ₤20 and their convictions were recorded, an <b>outcome</b> <b>that</b> was to have serious repercussions in their second trial.|$|E

25|$|ASALA, {{trained in}} the Beirut camps of the Palestine Liberation Organization, is {{the best known of}} the guerrilla groups {{responsible}} for assassinations of at least 36 Turkish diplomats. Since 1975, a couple of dozen Turkish diplomats or members of their families had been targeted in a couple of dozens of attacks, with the <b>outcome</b> <b>that</b> the Armenian vengeance, as well as the background to the Armenian struggle, have made it to the world press. These notable acts, while carried out by a small group, were successful in conveying the Armenian Genocide to the forefront of international awareness.|$|E
25|$|The SM83, ST86 and ST89 {{were not}} subject to the cable and braking issue and were {{therefore}} kept in service. Originally Oslo ordered seventeen SL95s and planned to keep either the SM83 or the SM91 units. However, the options for another fifteen SL95s was redeemed, allowing all non-articulated trams to be retired. As the SL95 units were delivered, retirement of SM83 commenced in mid 1999. The choice to retire SM83 before SM91 was both that the former were in worse technical condition and that the need to raise the voltage on the tramway to 750 volts. SM91 had proven that it could adapt to such in Gothenburg, an <b>outcome</b> <b>that</b> the SM83 could not be sure of duplicating.|$|E
25|$|The {{benefits}} of undergoing anger management brings around the successful reduction in anger and violent outbursts. Personal relationships {{that have been}} previously strained by {{a high level of}} aggression may undergo improvement. Professionally, workplace relationships have a similar <b>outcome</b> <b>that</b> are beneficial to an individual's career and personal sense of satisfaction. Legally, continued attendance to anger management programs, mandated or not, {{can be seen as a}} sign of good faith. For incarcerated individuals, an earlier parole time can be the result of good behavior learned from anger management classes. From an emotional standpoint, reducing the internal level of anger results in a decrease in stress and an increase in overall happiness as a result.|$|E
