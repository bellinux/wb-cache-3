5|$|Dreyer {{shot and}} edited {{the film in}} France and then brought it to Berlin where it was post-synchronized in both German and French. Dreyer did the audio work at Universum Film AG, as they had the best sound {{equipment}} available {{to him at the}} time. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actors</b> did not dub their own voices. The only voices <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actors</b> that are their own in the film are of Schmitz and Gunzburg. The sounds of dogs, parrots, and other animals in the film were fake and were done by professional imitators. Wolfgang Zeller composed the film's score and worked with Dreyer to develop the music.|$|E

5|$|Although Oriental was short-lived, several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actors</b> {{and crew}} it hired {{went on to}} lengthy careers.

5|$|In {{the decades}} since its release, modern film {{scholars}} {{have noted the}} possible homosexual reading of the film. Director James Whale was openly gay, and some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actors</b> in the cast, including Ernest Thesiger and Colin Clive, {{were believed to be}} gay or bisexual. Although James Curtis, Whale's biographer, rejects the notion that Whale would have identified with the Monster from a homosexual perspective, scholars have perceived a gay subtext suffused through the film, especially a camp sensibility, particularly embodied in the character of Pretorius and his relationship with Henry.|$|E

5|$|Renoir {{continued}} shooting additional {{scenes with}} some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actors.</b> The opening {{scene at the}} airfield was shot in mid-June at the Bourget Airport {{in the middle of}} the night with whatever extras they could find.
