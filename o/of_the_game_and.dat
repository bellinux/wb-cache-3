5|$|The team worked {{alongside}} {{artists and}} DJ's for incorporation of songs into the game. Neil stated they brought to artists and DJ's working prototypes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>and</b> hardware {{to show them}} what the sampled music and final mixes sounded like, garnering interest from these groups. This led to securing of rights from several groups for their songs, though this did occur late in the development process. Mixing with celebrity DJ's was performed either though electronic communications, or at FreeStyleGames' studios or the homes or studios of the DJ's themselves; the team outlined the goals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>and</b> requested mixes that emphasized the gameplay featured, but avoided hampering the creativity of the artists.|$|E
