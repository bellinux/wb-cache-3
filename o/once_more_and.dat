5|$|The {{two teams}} traded {{possessions}} <b>once</b> <b>more,</b> <b>and</b> {{as the first}} quarter came to an end, Georgia Tech was in possession of the ball but was preparing to punt it away after yet another failure {{to pick up a}} first down.|$|E

Trinidad's first professional loss was against Bernard Hopkins later in 2001, and following this he retired from boxing for the first time. Trinidad made his ring return by defeating Ricardo Mayorga in 2004 and, after a losing effort against Winky Wright in 2005, retired for a second time. In 2008 he returned <b>once</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> lost to Roy Jones Jr. Subsequently, Trinidad entered a five-year hiatus without clarifying the status of his career.|$|E
5|$|Cedar Creek {{marked the}} end of the campaign. Hayes was {{promoted}} to brigadier general in October 1864 and brevetted major general. Around this time, Hayes learned of the birth of his son, George Crook Hayes. The army went into winter quarters <b>once</b> <b>more,</b> <b>and</b> in spring 1865 the war quickly came to a close with Lee's surrender to Grant at Appomattox. Hayes visited Washington, D.C. that May and observed the Grand Review of the Armies, after which he and the 23rd Ohio returned to their home state to be mustered out of the service.|$|E

5|$|Ernest Lee Fletcher {{was born}} in Mount Sterling, Kentucky on November 12, 1952. He was the third of four {{children}} born to Harold Fletcher, Sr. and his wife, Marie. The family owned a farm and operated a general store near the community of Means. Harold Fletcher also worked for Columbia Gas. When Ernie was three weeks old, Harold was transferred to Huntington, West Virginia.

5|$|Eventually, Malachi leaves Castiel {{with the}} angel Theo who tells Castiel {{he wants to}} defect to Metatron's side. Castiel tricks Theo into {{releasing}} him and steals his Grace, transforming Castiel into an angel <b>once</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> at least restoring his powers. Castiel calls Dean and tells him {{that while he was}} held captive by Malachi he learned that the angel Ezekiel is dead and so the angel possessing Sam must be an impostor.|$|E
5|$|Following popular {{television}} {{appearances and}} concerts during their February 1964 visit, the Beatles {{returned to the}} United States in August 1964, and again in August 1965, for tours. In August 1966 they returned <b>once</b> <b>more,</b> <b>and</b> although this tour was commercially successful, it coincided with a storm of U.S. public protest after publication of a quote from John Lennon's remarks about Christianity. The 1966 U.S. tour {{marked the end of}} the Beatles' concert days. The band ceased to perform commercial concerts, instead devoting their efforts to creating new material in the recording studio.|$|E

5|$|For {{the home}} Ashes series of 195051 Tallon was fit <b>once</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> {{available}} for national selection. Despite making only 37 runs in four innings in the lead-up matches, Tallon {{was chosen for}} all five Tests. He had a poor time with the bat, making only 39runs {{at an average of}} just 6.50. He took only eight catches, but kept tidily to retain his place in the team. His performances for Queensland were hardly more productive; he scored 161 runs at 16.10 and aside from a rain-affected draw, his state lost their remaining six matches.|$|E
5|$|He {{served as}} a member of the {{evaluation}} board for Operation Crossroads, and was an advisor to Bernard Baruch, the United States' representative on the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission. In 1950, during the Korean War, Farrell returned to active duty with the Army <b>once</b> <b>more,</b> <b>and</b> served with the Defense Production Administration. In July 1951, he was transferred to the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), the successor organization to the Manhattan Project, where he became the Assistant General Manager for Manufacturing. In this role, he oversaw a vast increase in the Commission's production capabilities. The construction of new reactors at the Hanford and Savannah River Sites would eventually triple the production of nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|In 662, Maximus {{was placed}} on trial <b>once</b> <b>more,</b> <b>and</b> was once more convicted of heresy. Following the trial Maximus was tortured, having his tongue cut out, so {{he could no longer}} speak his rebellion, and his right hand cut off, so that he could no longer write letters. Maximus was then exiled to the Lazica or Colchis region of modern-day Georgia and was cast in the {{fortress}} of Schemarum, perhaps Muris-Tsikhe near the modern town of Tsageri. He died soon thereafter, on 13 August 662. The events of the trials of Maximus were recorded by Anastasius Bibliothecarius.|$|E

5|$|In {{the center}} of Mellenville, NY217 intersects with CR9 (Mellenville Road), with NY217 serving as CR9's {{southern}} terminus. NY217 then heads southeast, crossing Claverack Creek and passing Mellenville Union Cemetery to the north {{as well as the}} adjacent Claverack Town Park. The route turns eastward and meets the northern terminus of Roxbury Road as it enters the village of Philmont. Within Philmont, NY217 follows Main Street through {{the center of}} the densely populated village. At an intersection with Maple Street, the highway comes within view of Summit Lake, a small water body in the center of Philmont. Past the lake, NY217 turns northeast <b>once</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> intersects with CR11 (Martindale Road) as it leaves the village.|$|E

On her way to port she had {{encountered}} , which assisted her and accompanied her into port. With {{the assistance of the}} crews from two sloops, the guardship , and troops from Pendennis Castle at the pumps, the crew managed to stop the water level in the hold rising any further. Agamemnon made for Plymouth for repairs. Movement caused the leak to gain on the men at the pumps <b>once</b> <b>more,</b> <b>and</b> when she was off Penlee Point, Agamemnon fired a gun for assistance. When she reached Plymouth she was lashed to a sheer hulk to prevent her sinking.|$|E
5|$|On 27 July, as the {{squadron}} neared Rochefort, it was spotted by HMS Mars, a Royal Navy ship {{of the line}} stationed off the port to intercept French ships entering or leaving. Signalling {{to the rest of}} the British squadron, Captain Robert Dudley Oliver took Mars in pursuit, chasing the French squadron all through the night and into the next morning, by which time the frigate Rhin had fallen far behind the others. Recognising that Rhin was in danger of being captured, Lamellerie turned back to her defence with his main squadron but then changed his mind, turning <b>once</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> retreating to Rochefort as Oliver took possession of the heavily outgunned Rhin.|$|E

Whilst en route, Spock enters pon farr and finds {{that he is}} linked to Kirk, but mates with the Romulan Thea {{to allow it to}} pass.

They travel back in time and disable the agents, but Spock is seriously injured and dying. Kirk and Spock mindmeld as reality shifts <b>once</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> restores the original timeline.|$|E

5|$|The French king, Henry II, {{proposed}} to unite France and Scotland by marrying the young queen to his three-year-old son, the Dauphin Francis. On {{the promise of}} French military help, and a French dukedom for himself, Arran agreed to the marriage. In February 1548, Mary was moved, again for her safety, to Dumbarton Castle. The English {{left a trail of}} devastation behind <b>once</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> seized the strategic town of Haddington. In June, the much awaited French help arrived at Leith to besiege and ultimately take Haddington. On 7 July 1548, a Scottish Parliament held at a nunnery near the town agreed to a French marriage treaty.|$|E
5|$|The Petition {{caused a}} flurry of {{broadside}} satires, poems and ballads on the subject through the following year. The historian James Turner identifies this event {{as an example of}} a new carnivalisation of sexuality in Restoration England, where genuine political attack, satire, street commentary and bawdy theatre came together. Two years after the riots, a mob gathered <b>once</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> again swore they would raze Cresswell's cathouse to the ground, though protection from the local beadles prevented the attack.|$|E
