5|$|Halotus died {{sometime}} {{in the latter part}} of the 1st century. At the time of his death, he still held the procuratorship that he had been granted by Galba. He kept this position despite Galba's unseating very soon after it was bestowed and the political uproars of The Year of the Four Emperors. At the time of his death, Halotus' public reputation had been at least partially restored and he had accumulated some degree of wealth after he had been cleared by Galba. Details relating to his death are not recorded in any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>writings</b> of ancient historians, and neither are any specific dates.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} {{to look through the}} history of biology from the ancient Greeks onwards and discover anticipations of almost all of Charles Darwin's key ideas. For example, Loren Eiseley has found isolated passages written by Buffon suggesting he was almost ready to piece together a theory of natural selection, but states that such anticipations should not be taken out of the full context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>writings</b> or of cultural values of the time which made Darwinian ideas of evolution unthinkable.|$|E
5|$|Although most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>writings</b> {{that have}} survived {{from this period}} are {{religious}} in nature, there is sufficient literary evidence that secular writing was also popular in the imperial court. Some of these writings carry useful information on urban life, grandeur of the imperial and provincial courts, royal weddings and ceremonies. Other works refer the general town planning, fortifications and ordnance details at Vijayanagara and other important cities, irrigation reservoirs, merchants and shops dealing {{in a variety of}} commodities. On occasion, authors dwell on mythical cities that reflect their idealised views on contemporary life. Commonly found in these works are description of artists and professionals and their relationship with the court. These included poets, bards, composers, painters, sculptors, dancers, theatrical performers and even wrestlers. Others who find mention are political leaders, ambassadors, concubines, accountants, goldsmiths, moneylenders and even servants and door keepers.|$|E
5|$|The Western Ganga {{rule was}} a period of brisk {{literary}} activity in Sanskrit and Kannada, though many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>writings</b> are now considered extinct and are known only from references made to them. Chavundaraya's writing, Chavundaraya Purana (or Trishashtilakshana mahapurana) of 978 CE, is an early existing work in prose style in Kannada and contains a summary of the Sanskrit writings, Adipurana and Uttarapurana which were written a century earlier by Jinasena and Gunabhadra during the rule of Rashtrakuta Amoghavarsha I. The prose, composed in lucid Kannada, was mainly meant for the common man and avoided any reference to complicated elements of Jain doctrines and philosophy. His writings seem to be influenced by the writings of his predecessor Adikavi Pampa and contemporary Ranna. The work narrates the legends of a total of 63 Jain proponents including twenty-four Jain Tirthankar, twelve Chakravartis, nine Balabhadras, nine Narayanas and nine Pratinarayanas.|$|E
