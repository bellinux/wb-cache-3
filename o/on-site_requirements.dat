40|$|Battery {{energy storage}} can be {{integrated}} with renewable energy generation systems in either grid-connected or stand-alone applications. For stand-alone systems, batteries are essential to store electricity for use {{when the sun is}} not shining or when the wind is not blowing. For grid-connected systems, batteries add value to intermittent renewable resources by facilitating a better match between the demand and supply. The system characterized in this appendix consists of a 30 kWh battery energy storage system operating with a 30 kW PV array to shave peak load on the utility side of the meter. This system is sized for commercial or small industrial applications (low-rise buildings where PV arrays are mounted on the roof and the battery system is installed indoors) as opposed to residential (1 - 4 kW) or utility (multi-MW) applications. Although batteries can be charged either by the PV array when PV output exceeds <b>on-site</b> <b>requirements,</b> or by the grid during off-peak hours for use during peak periods when rates are higher, only the latter case is considered in this appendix based on the data available. This data is from the first-of-a-kind-product. As indicated in Figure 1, the system components include a “max power tracker”, the battery subsystem, a power conditioning subsystem (PCS), switchgear and structural/mechanical items. The PV array consists of fixed PV modules that use large-area, solid-state semiconductor devices to convert sunlight into DC power. The PV subsystem is characterized elsewhere in this document...|$|E
40|$|Introduction This report {{deals with}} the methods that have been evolved in the USA for reallocating the costs of {{development}} infrastructure (roads, water supply, and other facilities) {{between the public and}} private sectors. In the past it has been assumed that the public sector should meet most of these costs, recouping them by means of general and local taxation and user charges. In both America and the UK, housebuilders and other developers have generally been expected to provide on-site services (local estate roads, link-up to mains water and drainage, car parking,etc.), but the public sector has been responsible for off-site provision [...] major roads, water supply, sewerage, and a range of other physical infrastructure and community facilities. But it is not inevitable that all of these costs should be met by the public sector. It can be argued that there is a good case for those costs being met, at least in part, by the landowners, developers, and employers who will benefit from them. The problem is to find practical and consistent methods of allocating those costs and of requiring developers and others to meet them or to provide the necessary facilities themselves. In the UK there has been some movement in this direction in recent years, mainly by means of planning agreements under Section 52 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1971. * Such agreements have been limited in extent and not applied in any comprehensive or consistent manner. The Water Act 1989 introduced provisions enabling water companies to levy charges towards the capital cost of new installations, and there are provisions concerning highways in earlier legislation. But there has been no general application of the principle that "the developer pays. " In the USA, on the other hand, there has been a long tradition of requiring developers to provide roads, parks, local school sites, and various other facilities within their developments. In recent years this type of requirement has been extended to a wider range of purposes (e. g. traffic lights, school buildings). Smaller developers can make payments in lieu of actual provision. But many American cities and counties have gone well beyond much <b>on-site</b> <b>requirements.</b> In these cities, developers are now expected to contribute towards the costs of off-site roads, bridges, intersections, water mains and sewerage, storm water drainage, high schools, major open space, public car parking, libraries [...] even "law and order. " some cities have extended the concept so as to require office developers to contribute to the provision of public transport (mass transit), low-cost housing, and child-care facilities. Various novel methods have been developed for achieving this. The most widespread is the concept of "development impact fees," which prescribe a standard scale of charges for new development. There is a variety of other fiscal devices for similar purposes. In addition, some cities are making extensive use of "Development Agreements" which, instead of standard fees, rely on negotiated agreements with individual developers. Some local governments use all these methods, and new measures are constantly being devised. This is what this report is about. I now briefly summarize its structure and content. Part One deals in detail with development impact fees, since this is the most widely used method of charging developers for the costs of the infrastructure needs that their development generates. Chapter 1 explains the concept of impact fees and illustrates their use. This is intended as an "appetizer" for what follows. Its intention is to explain the context within which impact fees and similar devices have evolved, the scale and pace of development, and the changing climate of local government finance. The miscellaneous information that it displays is drawn {{from a wide variety of}} sources, from scholarly books to newspaper cuttings. It is impressionistic and serves to demonstrate that, while much of the language of land-use planning in America will be familiar to the British reader, the context within which it operates is something different. Chapters 3 to 6 are the meat of Part One. In these chapters I set out the concept of impact fees as it has developed in the somewhat demanding judicial atmosphere that prevails in most states, where the Courts are very protective of private property rights and tend to take a cautious view of fiscal and regulatory innovations. To safeguard against the risk of successful legal challenge, the proponents of impact fees have adopted a belt-and-braces approach, and the result is a distinctly complex and demanding process for devising and validating impact fees. It is necessary to set out the lineaments of the system in this fairly detailed manner, as it provides the basis from which a somewhat simpler approach could be developed. It was reassuring to find that in California, where impact fees originated and are most widely used, the courts have taken a less rigorous approach to impact fees. Provided they can be satisfied that appropriate legislative or regulatory powers exist for the purpose, that the fees adopted have a rational basis and are reasonable in relation to the relevant expenditure, and that they are administered in a consistent and equitable manner, they do not demand an unrealistic degree of precision in the methods of calculation and attribution. I think that in the UK our approach would be similar, but it is useful to be aware of the more theoretical formulation. Chapter 7 indulges in a digression housing, suggesting that the costs of infrastructure and the level of fees could be moderated if Americans were less prodigal in their use of land and applied more effectively what they know about land-use planning or, in their terms, "growth management" (which can mean either facilitating or restricting development). There is more about housing in Part Two. Part One concludes with a case study of Raleigh, North Carolina, and its recent experience in introducing an impact fees system. Part Two of the report reviews more briefly a a variety of other methods, both traditional and novel, of exacting or soliciting contributions from developers to the provision of infrastructure and community facilities. I deal first with the longest established forms of developer contributions: those implemented through traditional subdivision regulations. Secondly I deal with "contract zoning," another adaptation of a traditional regulatory system, which relates to variances granted to exchange for some undertaking given by the developer. I then consider the much more recent "linkage programmes," which are in some respects similar to impact fees but where the concept has been extended beyond what is normally regarded as infrastructure to include the provision by office developers of low-cost housing [...] and child-care facilities. I describe separately arrangements that require housebuilders to include a proportion of low-cost housing to their projects or, more often, offer zoning incentives to do so. I include a short note on excise taxes as an alternative to impact fees. I explain the concept of the Special Assessment District, where a supplementary local tax is levied on occupiers in a specific area to pay for services that benefit solely that area. This mechanism has been extended in some states to facilitate developments on the scale of a new town, and I describe the Florida legislation. I deal more fully with the scope for negotiated agreements with developers, which are favoured by many experienced local government officials and major developers, as it is a much more flexible method and offers more scope for the exercise of negotiating skills on both sides than a standard fees scale. I describe the Californian legislation. In Chapter 8 I deal with various methods used in California to finance transportation systems. Chapter 7, on Development Agreements, is particularly relevant to the US situation and the possible reform of Section 52 / 1971. All these methods are in use in the US, and they demonstrate that a developer is pursuing his project usually needs the co-operation of the local authority and other bodies, both in securing his building permit and in ensuring that his development is adequately serviced. He may prefer a predictable scale of fees and to know in advance that will be required of him; but he may also be prepared to negotiate a higher contribution, especially if he needs a higher standard of provision or seeks higher priority among competing projects. Part Three provides a general assessment of what has gone before, and offers some conclusions on its relevance to the US and a possible legislative approach to recasting Section 52 to provide for both Development Agreements and Developer Contributions in a form compatible with UK conditions. In conclusion, I should emphasize that this is not a work of scholarship and therefore lacks entirely the scholarly apparatus of footnotes and bibliography. I have freely pillaged (but I hope not plagiarized) a wide range of materials generally without acknowledgement. But, so far as I am aware, there is no single publication that deals with all the varieties of systems described in this report. It is, of course, written by a visitor to the US and from a British perspective. But in my own experience it is always interesting to see how someone from another country describes processes with which one is familiar: even their errors and omissions can prove instructive. The work on this report was done during my tenure of a Nuffield and Leverhulme Travelling Fellowship in 1989 - 90 while on secondment from the Department of the Environment. I readily record my appreciation of the Fellowship programme, which affords the opportunity to those in government service to combine their experience of practical administration with the benefits of new experience. In the course of my fellowship I prepared a second report on Aesthetic Control: methods used in the USA to control the design of buildings. Both reports are being published by IURD, and both deal with the relationship between public and private interests in the development process. Although I cannot attempt here to acknowledge all those who have helped me in the course of this study [...] academic colleagues, developers, realtors, homebuilders, city, county, state, and federal officials, and many others [...] I must express my thinks to my two main hosts, Professor Michael Stegman, Director of the Department of City and Regional Planning at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Professor Peter Hall, Director of the Institute of Urban and Regional Development in the University of California at Berkeley. I worked for several weeks at both of these institutions and had every assistance from them. I must also thank Dr. Derek Nicholls, the Director of the Department of Land Economy at Cambridge University in England, where I now enjoy similar facilities. Finally, I should record that the contents of this report are the author's responsibility and do not necessarily reflect the view of the Department of the Environment.

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we study a {{variation}} of the Dynamic Traveling Repairperson Problem (DTRP) in which there are two classes of demands; high priority, and low priority. In the problem, demands arrive in the environment randomly over time and assume a random location and <b>on-site</b> service <b>requirement.</b> A service vehicle must travel to each demand location and provide the required on-site service. The quality of service provided to each class of demands is measured by the expected delay between a demand’s arrival and its service completion. The goal is to design policies for the service vehicle which minimize a convex combination of the delays for each class. We provide a lower bound on the achievable delay for this problem, and propose a policy which performs within a known constant factor of the optimal in heavy load (i. e., when the fraction of time the service vehicle spends performing on-site service approaches one). The problem studied in this paper is analogous to the multi-class queuing problem in classical queuing theory. I...|$|R

The second design combines Brayton conversion with the SP- 100 reactor in a erectable 550 -kWe powerplant concept intended to satisfy later-phase lunar base power requirements. This system capitalizes on experience gained from operating the initial 100 -kWe module and incorporates some technology improvements. For this system, the reactor is emplaced in a lunar regolith excavation to provide man-rated shielding, and the Brayton engines and radiators are mounted on the lunar surface and extend radially from the central reactor. Design emphasis is on performance, safety, long life, and operational flexibility...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this work}} {{is to create an}} {{integrated}} framework for forecasting the adoption of distributed energy resources (DER), both by electricity customers and by the various institutions within the industry itself, and for evaluating the effect of this adoption on the power system, particularly on the overall reliability and quality of electrical service to the end user. This effort and follow on contributions are intended to anticipate and explore possible patterns of DER deployment, thereby guiding technical work on microgrids towards the key technical problems. An early example of this process addressed is the question of possible DER adopting customer disconnection. A deployment scenario in which many customers disconnect from their distribution company (disco) entirely leads to a quite different set of technical problems than a scenario in which customers self generate a significant share or all of their <b>on-site</b> electricity <b>requirements</b> and additionally buy and sell energy and ancillary services (AS) locally and/or into wider markets.

40|$|As {{the model}} energy codes are {{improved}} to reach efficiency levels 50 percent greater than current codes, installation of on-site renewable energy generation {{is likely to}} become a code requirement. This requirement will be needed because traditional mechanisms for code improvement, including the building envelope, mechanical systems, and lighting, have been maximized at the most cost-effective limit. Research has been conducted to determine the mechanism for implementing this requirement (Kaufman 2011). Kaufmann et al. determined that the most appropriate way to structure an <b>on-site</b> renewable <b>requirement</b> for commercial buildings is to define the requirement in terms of an installed power density per unit of roof area. This provides a mechanism that is suitable for the installation of photovoltaic (PV) systems on future buildings to offset electricity and reduce the total building energy load. Kaufmann et al. suggested that an appropriate maximum for the requirement in the commercial sector would be 4 W/ft 2 of roof area or 0. 5 W/ft 2 of conditioned floor area. As with all code requirements, there must be an alternative compliance path for buildings that may not reasonably meet the renewables requirement.

Southeastern OSB requires 771. 6 kg (1701 lb, oven-dry basis) of roundwood raw material input. 545. 7 kg (1203 lb) of this input ends in final OSB product, giving a total wood recovery of 71 %. The remaining wood input ends as wood residue for fuel, wood residues sold as co-products, and wood waste sent to the landfill. <b>On-site</b> energy <b>requirements</b> for southeastern OSB are 5261 MJ (4. 99 million BTU).

A structural approach with instrumental variables provides estimates of hospital quality both on average and varying with patient characteristics. I estimate the model using a sample of non-emergency cardiac patients obtained from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. I find evidence of a significant mortality improvement for patients treated at physician-owned hospitals, which primarily holds for moderate-severity patients. There is no strong evidence of physician-owner cherry-picking of healthier patients. The distribution of patients across hospitals is primarily driven by physicians' average preferences over hospitals. The second chapter explores price transparency in health care. Many U. S. states have recently begun requiring that hospitals publish prices, citing the need for consumer search. This paper uses two sources of longitudinal hospital data to evaluate the effects of Web-based price-posting <b>requirements</b> and <b>on-site</b> price-posting <b>requirements</b> on the distribution of hospital prices in nineteen states with such regulations. I find that transparency regulation is associated on average with small price increases, which is inconsistent with transparency enhancing consumer search. The effects are smaller among for-profit hospitals and in areas with a greater self-pay patient population. The third chapter (co-authored with Glenn Ellison) examines differences in the frequency with which students from different schools reach high levels of math achievement. Data from the American Mathematics Competitions is used to produce counts of high-scoring students from public U. S. high schools. High-achieving students are far from evenly distributed. There are strong demographic predictors of high achievement, but there are large differences among seemingly similar schools. The unobserved heterogeneity across schools includes a thick tail of schools that produce many more high-achieving students than the average school. Gender-related differences and other breakdowns are discussed. by Ashley Swanson. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Economics, 2012.

40|$|International audienceDuring {{previous}} works, square pulsed thermography {{was used}} to carry out non destructive testing of bonding quality of CFRP glued on civil engineering structures during reinforcement operations [1, 2]. The use of such wave form excitation was motivated by " <b>on-site</b> " <b>requirements,</b> but also by measurements duration, number of composite layers to test, depth of possible faulting areas versus temperature elevation allowed at composite level according to inner heat diffusion. Nevertheless, square pulsed excitation implies to choose an adapted heat duration. This duration is directly linked to {{the reliability of the}} parameter estimator [3]. In fact, after a certain duration the standard deviation of the estimation procedure stagnates. According to these observations, an indicator able to predict the sufficient heating time when the reliability of the parameter estimator reached an asymptotic evolution behavior was studied. Based on the absolute thermal contrast, the proposed indicator Iph is defined with the maximum thermal contrast ∆Tmax and the time delay (tph) between the heating time tc and the appearance of the maximum contrast, as shown in figure 1 (left). A typical evolution of the Iph indicator is proposed in figure 1 (right). This indicator allows to take into acount the detectability as well as the induced flaw temporal effect on the thermal contrast shape evolution. It has been observed that the maximum of Iph is connected with the sufficient heating time when the standard deviation of the estimation procedure tends to be minimized. This paper will present the establishment of this indicator for optimal square heating time and present an analysis of results obtained with numerical simulations and laboratory experiments.

40|$|Interruptible power rates, Utility {{special rate}} negotiations, and the {{emergence}} of a spot electrical power market all can lead to lower industrial energy costs. The installation of low cost on-site diesel powered generation, or the proposed intention to install, provides the means for obtaining lower purchased power costs. The functionality of a standby power system and its inherent value in the coming free market purchase of electrical energy are added benefits. Project feasibility, conceptual design, <b>on-site</b> generation facility <b>requirements,</b> interconnection requirements, and operation and maintenance costs will be examined. Installation costs in the range of $ 350 to $ 400 per KW and operating costs of approximately $ 0. 06 to $ 0. 07 per kWhr compared to purchased power rates determine the feasibility of an on-site generation system. In some cases avoided demand charges offer an opportunity for savings such that special rates are not needed for a feasible project. Depending on the manufacturer, low capital cost diesel generators are available in 1000 to 2000 KW blocks. Capacity requirements determine the number of engines required. Large capacity installations are somewhat restricted by voltage and current ratings. Some variants for multiple engine generator installations will yield greater reliability or lower costs depending on objectives. Specific requirements for basic building blocks of an on-site generation system will be examined as well {{as an example of a}} 5, 500 KW installation. IEA provides an alternative to installing and operating an on-site generation system. IEA owns and operates diesel standby generation systems for customers, with responsibility for all maintenance and operation as well as associated costs.

Department of Energy (USDOE) sites {{as the final}} disposition for large amounts of waste associated with cleanup of contaminated areas and facilities. These facilities are typically developed with regulatory oversight from States and/or the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) in addition to USDOE. The facilities are developed to meet design standards for disposal of hazardous waste {{as well as the}} USDOE performance based standards for disposal of radioactive waste. The involvement of multiple and different regulators for facilities across separate sites has resulted in some differences in expectations for performance assessments and risk assessments (PA/RA) that are developed for the disposal facilities. The USDOE-EM Office of Site Restoration formed a working group to foster improved communication and sharing of information for personnel associated with these Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) disposal cells and work towards more consistent assumptions, as appropriate, for technical and policy considerations related to performance and risk assessments in support of a Record of Decision and Disposal Authorization Statement. The working group holds teleconferences, as needed, focusing on specific topics of interest. The topics addressed to date include an assessment of the assumptions used for performance assessments and risk assessments (PA/RAs) for <b>on-site</b> disposal cells, <b>requirements</b> and assumptions related to assessment of inadvertent intrusion, DOE Manual 435. 1 - 1 requirements, and approaches for consideration of the long-term performance of liners and covers in the context of PAs.

This {{is the basis for}} a common situation awareness and safe ground operations. The associated operational concept has define the roles and tasks of the onboard and ground stakeholders and the procedures from an overall, holistic point of view. The development of conflict detection and resolution has not only increase safety but also efficiency. The project is following an iterative development process with system maturing phases followed by functional and operational testing phases. Two test campaigns were developed. Licensed controllers as well as aircraft pilots and ground vehicles drivers were involved in testing in order to gain realistic and operative results. Controllers and pilots were trained in a simulated environment and on-site to prepare them to cope with a level 1 or 2 A-SMGCS under real operational conditions. The systems implemented were to be verified and validated against the predefined operational and technical <b>requirements.</b> <b>On-site</b> long term trials at these test sites and additionally at the busiest European Hub at Paris were carried out.

40|$|As {{the model}} energy codes are {{improved}} to reach efficiency levels 50 percent greater than current codes, use of on-site renewable energy generation {{is likely to}} become a code requirement. This requirement will be needed because traditional mechanisms for code improvement, including envelope, mechanical and lighting, have been pressed to the end of reasonable limits. Research has been conducted to determine the mechanism for implementing this requirement (Kaufman 2011). Kaufmann et al. determined that the most appropriate way to structure an <b>on-site</b> renewable <b>requirement</b> for commercial buildings is to define the requirement in terms of an installed power density per unit of roof area. This provides a mechanism that is suitable for the installation of photovoltaic (PV) systems on future buildings to offset electricity and reduce the total building energy load. Kaufmann et al. suggested that an appropriate maximum for the requirement in the commercial sector would be 4 W/ft{sup 2 } of roof area or 0. 5 W/ft{sup 2 } of conditioned floor area. As with all code requirements, there must be an alternative compliance path for buildings that may not reasonably meet the renewables requirement. This might include conditions like shading (which makes rooftop PV arrays less effective), unusual architecture, undesirable roof pitch, unsuitable building orientation, or other issues. In the short term, alternative compliance paths including high performance mechanical equipment, dramatic envelope changes, or controls changes may be feasible. These options may be less expensive than many renewable systems, which will require careful balance of energy measures when setting the code requirement levels. As the stringency of the code continues to increase however, efficiency trade-offs will be maximized, requiring alternative compliance options to be focused solely on renewable electricity trade-offs or equivalent programs. One alternate compliance path includes purchase of Renewable Energy Credits (RECs). Each REC represents a specified amount of renewable electricity production and provides an offset of environmental externalities associated with non-renewable electricity production. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to explore the possible issues with RECs and comparable alternative compliance options. Existing codes have been examined to determine energy equivalence between the energy generation requirement and the RECs alternative over the life of the building. The price equivalence of the requirement and the alternative are determined to consider the economic drivers for a market decision. This research includes case studies that review how the few existing codes have incorporated RECs and some of the issues inherent with REC markets. Section 1 of the report reviews compliance options including RECs, green energy purchase programs, shared solar agreements and leases, and other options. Section 2 provides detailed case studies on codes that include RECs and community based alternative compliance methods. The methods the existing code requirements structure alternative compliance options like RECs are the focus of the case studies. Section 3 explores the possible structure of the renewable energy generation requirement in the context of energy and price equivalence. The price of RECs have shown high variation by market and over time which makes it critical to for code language to be updated frequently for a renewable energy generation requirement or the requirement will not remain price-equivalent over time. Section 4 of the report provides a maximum case estimate for impact to the PV market and the REC market based on the Kaufmann et al. proposed requirement levels. If all new buildings in the commercial sector complied with the requirement to install rooftop PV arrays, nearly 4, 700 MW of solar would be installed in 2012, a major increase from EIA estimates of 640 MW of solar generation capacity installed in 2009. The residential sector could contribute roughly an additional 2, 300 MW based on the same code requirement levels of 4 W/ft{sup 2 } of roof area. Section 5 of the report provides a basic framework for draft code language recommendations based on the analysis of the alternative compliance levels...|$|R
40|$|In {{this final}} report {{describes}} and documents research that {{was conducted by}} the Ecological Engineering Research Program (EERP) at the University of the Pacific (Stockton, CA) under subcontract to Fiscalini Farms LP for work under the Assistance Agreement DE-EE 0001895 'Measurement and Evaluation of a Dairy Anaerobic Digestion/Power Generation System' from the United States Department of Energy, National Energy Technology Laboratory. Fiscalini Farms is operating a 710 kW biomass-energy power plant that uses bio-methane, generated from plant biomass, cheese whey, and cattle manure via mesophilic anaerobic digestion, to produce electricity using an internal combustion engine. The primary objectives of the project were to document baseline conditions for the anaerobic digester and the {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) system used for the dairy-based biomass-energy production. The baseline condition of the plant was evaluated in the context of regulatory and economic constraints. In this final report, the operation of the plant between start-up in 2009 and operation in 2010 are documented and an interpretation of the technical data is provided. An economic analysis of the biomass energy system was previously completed (Appendix A) and the results from that study are discussed briefly in this report. Results from the start-up and first year of operation indicate that mesophilic anaerobic digestion of agricultural biomass, combined with an internal combustion engine, is a reliable source of alternative electrical production. A major advantage of biomass energy facilities located on dairy farms appears to be their inherent stability and ability to produce a consistent, 24 hour supply of electricity. However, technical analysis indicated that the Fiscalini Farms system was operating below capacity and that economic sustainability would be improved by increasing loading of feedstocks to the digester. Additional operational modifications, such as increased utilization of waste heat and better documentation of potential of carbon credits, would also improve the economic outlook. Analysis of baseline operational conditions indicated that a reduction in methane emissions and other greenhouse gas savings resulted from implementation of the project. The project results indicate that using anaerobic digestion to produce bio-methane from agricultural biomass is a promising source of electricity, but that significant challenges need to be addressed before dairy-based biomass energy production can be fully integrated into an alternative energy economy. The biomass energy facility was found to be operating undercapacity. Economic analysis indicated a positive economic sustainability, even at the reduced power production levels demonstrated during the baseline period. However, increasing methane generation capacity (via the importation of biomass codigestate) will be critical for increasing electricity output and improving the long-term economic sustainability of the operation. Dairy-based biomass energy plants are operating under strict environmental regulations applicable to both power-production and confined animal facilities and novel approached are being applied to maintain minimal environmental impacts. The use of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) for nitrous oxide control and a biological hydrogen sulfide control system were tested at this facility. Results from this study suggest that biomass energy systems can be compliant with reasonable scientifically based air and water pollution control regulations. The most significant challenge for the development of biomass energy as a viable component of power production on a regional scale {{is likely to be the}} availability of energy-rich organic feedstocks. Additionally, there needs to be further development of regional expertise in digester and power plant operations. At the Fiscalini facility, power production was limited by the availability of biomass for methane generation, not the designed system capacity. During the baseline study period, feedstocks included manure, sudan grass silage, and refused-feed. The ability of the dairy to produce silage in excess of <b>on-site</b> feed <b>requirements</b> limited power production. The availability of biomass energy crops and alternative feedstocks, such as agricultural and food wastes, will be a major determinant to the economic and environmental sustainability of biomass based electricity production...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. May 2014. Major: Bioproducts/Biosystems Science Engineering and Management. Advisor: Omar R. Espinoza. xi, 141 pages; {{appendices}} 1 - 4. One of {{the most}} recent innovations in Engineered Wood Products is Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT). The system is based on the use of multi-layered panels made from solid wood boards glued together, with the grain direction of successive layers placed at 90 ° angles. The cross-laminated configuration improves rigidity, dimensional stability, and mechanical properties. Structurally, CLT offers performance comparable to concrete or steel, with panels suitable for use as walls, floors, roofs, and other applications. While CLT as a construction material has been successful in Europe for the past 20 years, and more recently has made inroads in the Australian and Canadian markets, it is not yet readily available in the United States. To better understand the market potential for CLT in the U. S., this study aims to assess the level of awareness, perceptions and willingness to adopt the system by U. S. professionals. To achieve these objectives, (a) a series of 10 interviews were conducted to gather insights from national and international CLT experts; (b) a web-based survey to U. S. architecture firms was conducted to gather information about familiarity, perceptions, performance and likelihood to adopt the system in the near future; and (c) a multi-family residential building project was designed to explore the architectural possibilities of the material. This study identified that the use of wood, a natural and renewable material, was the main advantage of CLT. Another important benefit of CLT over traditional construction systems is the dramatically shorter on-site construction time needed. CLT is a prefabricated system, thus reducing labor <b>requirements,</b> <b>on-site</b> waste, and accidents, all of which translates into significant cost reductions. The most commonly cited disadvantages of CLT were its acoustic and vibration performance. From the study {{it was found that the}} level of awareness about CLT is low among U. S. architects. Building Code compatibility, availability in the domestic market and cost were mentioned as the main barriers to the implementation of the system in the U. S. Cross-Laminated Timber appears to be a cost-competitive alternative to concrete structures, especially for buildings over six stories high. Architects seem to be willing to adopt CLT for their near-future projects, especially for multi-family, commercial, and recreational buildings. Importantly, this willingness to adopt CLT was found to be positively correlated to the level of awareness with the system. Results show that diffusion of knowledge about CLT and the role of early adopters will be essential for the successful introduction of this new building technology into the U. S. market. The preliminary design created as part of this study allowed demonstrating the structural capabilities of CLT, by maximizing the spans between structural elements achieving open and fluid living spaces. CLT also enabled the design of wide terraces and the inclusion of window openings on outside walls without compromising the structural integrity of the CLT elements...|$|R
