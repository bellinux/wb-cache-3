While these injuries have been infrequent its our exper-ience (fourteen cases in ten years), one type of injury is sufficiently distinctive to merit some discussion. It seems to have received little attention in the literature although Holevich recently preseisted one card injury its a series of major acute hand itlj uries. The injury to be described occurs when the worker’s hand is damaged by the needled surfaces of the drums xvhich, in the card or <b>picker</b> <b>machines,</b> carry out a serial process of separating and combing wool fibers. Two procedures may cause the injury. Otse is waste cleaning in which wool material, which settles on guide plates facing certain of the drums, is manually removed while the drums are its motion, usually as they are decelerating after the machine has been turned off. The other is drum stripping, its which a wire hand brush is tangentially applied to the drum to remove accumulated wool debris. In the former operation, the hand is hooked and drawn between the plate and drum. In the latter, if the brush is snagged, the han...|$|R
25|$|Most cotton in the United States, Europe and Australia is {{harvested}} mechanically, {{either by}} a cotton <b>picker,</b> a <b>machine</b> that removes the cotton from the boll without damaging the cotton plant, or by a cotton stripper, which strips the entire boll off the plant.

40|$|Background. Magnetic {{resonance}} (MR) phase-shift velocity mapping is {{an established}} method for measurement of nonturbulent intravascular flow. Shortening the echo {{time of the}} MR sequence to 3. 6 msec allowed application of the technique to turbulent jet flow. The objective {{of this study was}} validation of MR jet velocity mapping in patients with cardiac valve stenosis. Methods and Results. We used a 0. 5 -T <b>Picker</b> MR <b>machine</b> to measure peak poststenotic jet velocity in 15 consecutive patients recruited with known valve disease (six mitral stenosis, three of these restudied after valvoplasty, and 11 aortic stenosis). On the same day as the MR study, these patients underwent independent Doppler echocardiographic measurement of peak jet velocity. The results of 10 further MR investigations of aortic stenosis are also reported and compared with Doppler studies performed within 6 months. Of the 29 MR studies, 28 (97 %) produced interpretable velocity maps, the one failure being attributed to misplacement of the imaging slice in a case of severe aortic stenosis. Agreement between MR and Doppler measurements of peak jet velocity in the recruited group was as follows: n= 18; range, 1. 4 - 6. 1 m/sec; mean, 3 m/sec; mean of differences (MR-Doppler), 0. 23 m/sec; standard deviation of differences, 0. 49 m/sec.

40|$|ABSTRACT – The {{mechanical}} cotton <b>picker</b> is a <b>machine</b> that automates cotton harvesting in a {{way that}} reduces harvest time and maximizes efficiency. To develop a mechanical cotton picker with the intent on replacing manual labor. The first pickers were only capable of harvesting one row of cotton at a time, but were still able to replace up to forty hand laborers The current cotton picker is a self-propelled machine that removes cotton lint and seed (seed-cotton) users rows of barbed spindles that rotate at high speed and remove the seed-cotton from the plant. The seed-cotton is then removed from the spindles by a counter-rotating doffer and is then blown up into the basket the plant at up to six rows at a time. The picker or spindle type machine was designed to pick the open cotton from the bolls using spindles, fingers, or prongs, without injuring the plant's foliage and unopened bolls. In this cotton picking by spindle type machine will resul in sshort fibre content,micronair and fibre length will indirectly looses the fibre strength quality as compare to hand picking machine. over come to these problem make a cotton picking machine by suction will made a pressure equal to the hand picking (100 gm) Keywords:-cotton fibre/cotton harvesting/cotton fibre properties/cotton fibre testing/pneumatic cotton picking machin...|$|R
40|$|Poor {{regional}} {{air quality}} {{in some states}} across the US cotton belt has resulted in increased pressure on agricultural sources of particulate matter (PM) from air pollution regulators. Moreover, inaccurate emission factors used in the calculation of annual emissions inventories led to the identification of cotton harvesting as {{a significant source of}} PM 10 in California and Arizona. As a result, cotton growers in these states are now required to obtain air quality permits and submit management practice plans detailing the actions taken by the producer to reduce fugitive PM emissions from field operations. The objective of this work was to develop accurate PM emission factors for cotton harvesting in terms of total suspended particulate (TSP), PM 10, and PM 2. 5. Two protocols were developed and used to develop PM emission factors from cotton harvesting operations on three farms in Texas during 2006 and 2007. Protocol one utilized TSP concentrations measured downwind of harvesting operations with meteorological data measured onsite in a dispersion model to back-calculate TSP emission flux values. Flux values, determined with the regulatory dispersion models ISCST 3 and AERMOD, were converted to emission factors and corrected with results from particle size distribution (PSD) analyses to report emission factors in terms of PM 10 and PM 2. 5. Emission factors were developed for two-row (John Deere 9910) and sixrow (John Deere 9996) cotton pickers with protocol one. The uncertainty associated with the emission factors developed through protocol one resulted in {{no significant difference between the}} emission factors for the two machines. Under the second protocol, emission concentrations were measured onboard the six-row cotton <b>picker</b> as the <b>machine</b> harvested cotton. PM 10 and PM 2. 5 emission factors were developed from TSP emission concentration measurements converted to emission rates using the results of PSD analysis. The total TSP, PM 10, and PM 2. 5 emission factors resulting from the source measurement protocol are 1. 64 ? 0. 37, 0. 55 ? 0. 12, and 1. 58 E- 03 ? 4. 5 E- 04 kg/ha, respectively. These emission factors contain the lowest uncertainty and highest level of precision of any cotton harvesting PM emission factors ever developed. Thus, the emission factors developed through the source sampling protocol are recommended for regulatory use...|$|R
40|$|Over {{a fourth}} of the cotton {{produced}} in the US since 2002 has been produced in Texas, with most coming from the High Plains. In recent years, Texas has accounted for {{almost half of all}} US cotton production (USDA-NASS, 2008 b). Most cotton on the High Plains is of more storm-proof varieties that have traditionally been harvested using stripper harvesters. However, improvements in irrigation technology and shifting markets for US cotton have increased interest in picker harvesters in the region. A holistic comparison of picker and stripper harvesters in irrigated cotton on the High Plains of Texas was conducted focusing on differences in system efficiencies, the costs of ginning, fiber and yarn quality, and potential economic returns under comparable crop yields and conditions. Harvester performance was evaluated based on harvest efficiency, time-inmotion, and fuel consumption. Stripper harvesters left less cotton in the field, but most of the cotton left by the picker was of low quality. While the time spent in each operation of harvest was highly dependent on the operator and support equipment available, in general, picker harvesters were able to harvest a unit area of high-yielding cotton more quickly than stripper harvesters. The cost of ginning picked and stripped cotton was evaluated considering current fee schedules from gins on the High Plains. On average, it cost a producer $ 4. 76 more per bale to gin stripped-and-field-cleaned cotton than picked cotton. Fiber quality parameters were compared between harvest treatments based on results from High Volume Instrument (HVI) and Advanced Fiber Information System (AFIS) tests. Samples were ring-spun into carded and carded-and-combed yarns. Differences in fiber quality between harvest treatments were more pronounced when growing conditions were less favorable. Few differences were detected in carded yarn quality between harvest treatments, while more pronounced differences favoring picked cotton were seen in carded-and-combed yarns. A cost-benefit analysis was conducted to determine the production scenarios in which picker and stripper harvesters were most appropriate. Results indicate that, if a producer has sufficient yields coupled with sufficient area to harvest per <b>machine,</b> <b>picker</b> harvesting is a more profitable alternative to producers of on the High Plains...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{calculate}} {{the amount of energy}} absorbed in a material which is being irradiated, it is necessary to know the spectral distribution of the radiation. Hence it is desirable to have a knowledge of the spectra of x-rays coming from commercial machines. A radiation chemist, for instance, who irradiates a small sample in a beam of x-rays with a large field area, is interested in the spectral distribution of the primary radiation from the target. On the other hand, when the object being irradiated is large in area compared to the field area of the x-ray beam, as in cancer therapy, the scattered radiation within the medium must also be considered. In such a case it is also interesting to know the rate of energy absorption at various depths below the surface, and so the effect of depth on the spectral distribution is also desired. Of the various types of spectrometers {{that can be used in}} this energy range, a total absorption scintillation spectrometer was chosen. Such a system has an advantage over a crystal spectrometer or a Compton spectrometer in that the measured spectra are not altered as much by the necessary corrections. Another advantage, especially when measuring scattered spectra, is that much better counting efficiencies can be obtained. Also, since the detector consists only of a scintillator crystal with photomultiplier and impedance matching circuit and can be located remotely from the counting circuitry, a small and easily manoeuvred spectrometer can be constructed. Using such an apparatus, Cormack et al (1) have measured primary and scattered radiation from an x-ray machine operated at 400 kvp. Similar measurements were later made with 280 kvp radiation (2). This discussion covers work done using a <b>Picker</b> Vanguard x-ray <b>machine</b> operated at 140 kvp. It was found that since the lower end of the energy region used by previous workers was particularly important for this radiation, some refinements were required in the correction and calibration procedures. Also, effects such as background and attenuation which are more important at low energies, had to be treated more carefully...|$|R
