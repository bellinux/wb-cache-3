25|$|In December 2006, the Australian Ministry of Health {{revealed}} {{that two of}} the country’s major organ transplant hospitals had banned training of Chinese surgeons, in response to concerns about organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners and other prisoners. On 21 March 2013, the Australian Senate unanimously passed a motion concerning reports of organ harvesting in China. The motion, which was introduced one day after a parliamentary briefing on the subject of organ harvesting from Falun Gong prisoners, called on Australia to adopt strict standards to address the practice of international <b>organ</b> <b>trafficking.</b> The same year, Green party lawmakers in New South Wales, Australia, proposed legislation to criminalize and create specific offenses related to trafficking in human organs and tissue.|$|E
25|$|As stated above, {{under the}} National Organ Transplant Act of 1984, {{granting}} monetary incentives for organ donation is illegal in the United States. However, {{there has been}} some discussion about providing fixed payment for potential live donors. In 1988, regulated paid organ donation was instituted in Iran and, as a result, the renal transplant waiting list was eliminated. Critics of paid organ donation argue that the poor and vulnerable become susceptible to transplant tourism. Travel for transplantation becomes transplant tourism if the movement of organs, donors, recipients or transplant professionals occurs across borders and involves <b>organ</b> <b>trafficking</b> or transplant commercialism. Poor and underserved populations in underdeveloped countries are especially vulnerable to the negative consequences of transplant tourism because they have become a major source of organs for the 'transplant tourists' that can afford to travel and purchase organs.|$|E

40|$|NK {{cells have}} {{potential}} therapeutic impact in suppressing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and enhancing antitumor effects as a cellular therapy for hematologic malignancies. However, {{few studies have}} addressed the trafficking and in vivo behavior of NK cells in murine models of bone marrow transplantation (BMT). We investigated NK cell trafficking and survival following allogeneic and syngeneic BMT using a novel bioluminescence-based imaging strategy. Transplantation of luciferase-expressing NK cells revealed CD 62 L-mediated <b>trafficking</b> to lymphoid <b>organs</b> and <b>trafficking</b> to GVHD target tissues, as evidenced by in vivo and ex vivo bioluminescence imaging. The NK cells persisted for ~ 4 wk after transplantation in allogeneic recipients, but were not detectable in syngeneic recipients. CFSE-labeling studies showed extensive NK cell proliferation in vivo. Transplanted NK cells up-regulated molecules necessary for homing to the lymph nodes, gastrointestinal tract, and skin, yet did not cause clinical GVHD. This expansion and tissue-specific homing was not solely due to the conditioning regimen, as NK cells proliferated and reached lymphoid and GVHD target tissue in unconditioned allogeneic RAG 2 −/ − γ-chain−/ − recipients. IL- 2 enhanced expansion and antitumor activity of NK cells. These results provide significant insight int...|$|R
2500|$|Both {{developing}} and developed countries have forged various policies {{to try to}} increase the safety and availability of organ transplants to their citizens. Austria, Brazil, France, Italy, Poland and Spain have ruled all adults potential donors with the [...] "opting out" [...] policy, unless they attain cards specifying not to be. However, whilst potential recipients in developing countries may mirror their more developed counterparts in desperation, potential donors in developing countries do not. The Indian government has had difficulty tracking the flourishing organ black market in their country, but in recent times it has amended its organ transplant law to make punishment more stringent for commercial dealings in organs. It has also included new clauses in the law to support deceased organ donation, such as making it mandatory to request for organ donation in case of brain death. Other countries victimized by illegal organ trade have also implemented legislative reactions. [...] Moldova has made international adoption illegal in fear of organ traffickers. China has made selling of organs illegal as of July 2006 and claims that all prisoner organ donors have filed consent. However, doctors in other countries, such as the United Kingdom, have accused China of abusing its high capital punishment rate.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} number of patients being offered kidney transplantation by many centers in the developing world, it is not unexpected that there would be attendant ethical and legal issues even when the selection process for transplantation seems medically justified. Because of the inadequate infrastructure for hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, coupled with the challenges of logistics for maintenance dialysis, transplantation would seem to be the best option for patients with end-stage renal failure, even in developed economies where these can easily be tackled.

40|$|AbstractObjectives {{to analyse}} the {{relationship}} between vascular trauma and associated injuries to intra-thoracic and abdominal <b>organs</b> caused by <b>traffic</b> accidents. Design retrospective study in a university hospital. Materials and methods we investigated 458 consecutive patients who were admitted with blunt thoracic and/or abdominal trauma caused by road traffic accidents between 1986 and 1999. Vascular trauma was encountered in 54 patients (12 %). Results the injured vessels were located in the abdomen in 45 patients and in the chest in nine patients. Mesenteric vessels were the most frequently injured vessels (33 / 45) in the abdomen, while the aorta and major vessels were most frequently injured (9 / 9) in the chest. Injury to the large/small intestine was often associated with mesenteric vessel injury (26 / 27). In the 190 patients with blunt abdominal organ injury, the frequency of mesenteric vessel injury was also highest, regardless of the injured organ. Vascular reconstruction was necessary only in one of 51 patients who underwent operation. Conclusions our results demonstrate that the mesenteric vessels are susceptible to blunt thoracic and abdominal trauma in road traffic accidents.

Previous studies {{carried out in}} rodents have demonstrated age-associated modulation of the expression of chemokine receptors such as CXCR 4 and CCR 5; however, {{little is known about}} the molecular mechanisms that regulate receptor expression and turnover in T cells, during advancing age in humans. Our recent results demonstrating increased chemotactic migration in response to CXCL 12 in CD 4 (+) T cells obtained from the elderly, as compared to those from young donors, led us to hypothesize that increase in surface expression, because of altered endocytic regulation of CXCR 4 on T cells during aging, might be directly responsible for increased migration toward CXCL 12. Studies presented here demonstrate a significant increase in the surface expression of CXCR 4 in CD 4 (+) T cells from elderly human donors, relative to those from the young. Additionally, CXCL 12 -mediated endocytosis of CXCR 4 was differentially regulated during aging, which could be attributed to alterations in the ubiquitination of CXCR 4. Thus, altered ubiquitination of CXCR 4 may contribute to the increased surface expression and enhanced T-cell migration to chemotactic stimuli in the elderly...|$|R

40|$|Background: Over {{the past}} several years, non-operative {{management}} has been increasingly recommended {{for the care of}} selected blunt abdominal trauma patients with solid organ injuries. Objective: To evaluate the pattern and outcome of blunt abdominal trauma using haemodynamic stability and ultrasonography in the selection of patients for non-operative management in a facility without computed tomogram. Methods: Patients admitted with blunt abdominal trauma between February 2005 and January 2010 were prospectively studied. Haemodynamic stability and sonography formed the basis for selecting patients for non-operative management. Results: In total, 58 patients suffered blunt ab-dominal trauma and 19 (33 %) patients were successfully managed non-operatively suffered blunt solid abdominal <b>organ</b> injuries. Road <b>traffic</b> accidents inflicted 17 (89 %) patients while 2 (11 %) patients sustained sports injury (football). The spleen was the commonest solid organ injured 12 (60 %), while the liver and kidney were injured in 6 (30 %) and 2 (10 %) respectively. Associated injuries were fractured left femur recorded in 3 (16 %) patients and fractured rib in a patient (5 %). Conclusion: Nonoperative treatment is a safe and effective method in the management of haemodynamically sta-ble patient with blunt solid abdominal organ injury. This translated to a reduction in hospital stay, absence of the risk of blood transfusion as well as attendant morbidity and mortality associated with laparotomy.
