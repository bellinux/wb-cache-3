5|$|The University Educational Trust (UET) is a 501 (c)(3) tax-exempt {{organization}} {{serving as}} a source of external fund-raising, funds-management and revenue-distribution at Cal Poly Pomona. With diminishing state support in recent years, the university has become not fully state-supported, but rather, state-assisted. UET oversees Cal Poly's endowment and generates resources with help of public and private partners to complement state-support and is recognized by the CSU Board of Trustees as a Title V auxiliary organization. It has a total capacity for up to 35 members and currently includes 4 officers, 18 community representatives, and 5 university representatives. The board of directors is composed of the university president who acts as an ex officio voting director and who appoints one ex officio executive director, one faculty member, one student member, and either the vice president for administrative affairs or the chief financial officer. All of the appointed voting directors serve one-, two-, or three-year terms and one-year terms thereafter, as determined by the university president. Other voting directors are elected by majority votes <b>of</b> <b>present</b> voting directors and serve three-year terms and may be re-elected for as many additional three-year terms as possible.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{reports a}} study <b>of</b> <b>presented</b> {{discourse}} in popular science narratives of discovery in English. It {{focuses on the}} fictionalizing role <b>of</b> <b>presented</b> discourse. The thesis proposes minor adjustments to the existing models <b>of</b> <b>presented</b> discourse analysis, dividing discourse presentation into Public Discourse (speech/writing) and Private Discourse (thought). After exploring the forms and functions of discourse presentation in the narratives, the thesis concludes that Private Discourse prefers the forms commonly associated with non-fiction while assigning to them the functions most often observed in fiction. All the forms of discourse presentation in the narratives contain dramatizing properties, yet Public Discourse possesses the highest degree of dramatization. Private Discourse in the narratives possesses communicative properties generally assigned to speech/writing presentation exclusively. Private Discourse {{is more likely to}} communicate scientific hypotheses than reveal the inner worlds of actants. The thesis concludes with an examination <b>of</b> <b>presented</b> discourse outside the narratives of discovery. This analysis confirms the phenomena observed in the narratives and reveals a unique feature <b>of</b> <b>presented</b> discourse outside the narratives-the fictionalized reader-a fictional actant created using discourse presentation. The findings <b>of</b> the thesis <b>present</b> a strong argument in favour of fictionality in popular science...|$|R
5|$|The history <b>of</b> <b>present</b> day gallantry awards traces back to {{the rule}} of East India Company in India. The first formal award was instituted by Lord William Bentinck in 1834, as the Order of Merit, which was later renamed as Indian Order of Merit in 1902. During the First World War, the awards were {{classified}} based on the English traditions for senior officers, junior officers, and enlisted men. Post-independence, the British honours and awards informally came to an end. However, attempts to institute new awards for India to honour the war heroes of 1947–1948 Indo-Pakistani War failed, as India was still a dominion. Eventually, the award was established on 26 January 1950, with retroactive effect from 15 August 1947.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} phenomenon {{that took place}} within the lands of Poland in the Early Middle Ages, {{as well as other}} parts of central and eastern Europe, was the arrival and permanent settlement of Slavic peoples. The Slavic migrations in the area of contemporary Poland started {{in the second half of}} the 5th century AD, about a half century after these territories were vacated by Germanic tribes. The first waves of the incoming Slavs settled the vicinity of the upper Vistula River and elsewhere in the lands <b>of</b> <b>present</b> southeastern Poland and southern Masovia. Coming from the east, from the upper and middle regions of the Dnieper River, the immigrants would have had come primarily from the western branch of the early Slavs known as Sclaveni, and since their arrival are classified as West Slavs. Their early archeological traces belong to the Prague-Korchak culture, which is similar to the earlier Kiev culture.|$|E
5|$|The path of SR 190 {{east of the}} Panamint Range in Death Valley National Park was {{followed}} in late 1849 and early 1850 by the Death Valley '49ers, a group of '49ers that had left the Old Spanish Trail at Enterprise, Utah {{to look for a}} shortcut to Walker Pass. The pioneers crossed the state line from Nevada near Ash Meadows, following the general route <b>of</b> <b>present</b> SR 190 from Death Valley Junction into Death Valley, which they left to the west into Panamint Valley and then turned south towards present State Route 178. After ore was discovered in Death Valley, the route became a primitive road, though most travel into the valley, such as the twenty-mule team borax route, was from the south.|$|E

5|$|Then, in 1957, {{the northernmost}} part <b>of</b> <b>present</b> SR57 {{was added to}} the state highway system as part of Route 240, which the {{legislature}} designated along the route planned for I-210. This became part of the proposed Temescal Freeway, later the Corona Freeway; a southerly extension of the Orange Freeway to Legislative Route 60 (SR 1) near Huntington Beach was added in 1959 as Route273. Also in 1959, the legislature created Route272, extending the line of the Orange Freeway north from the Pomona Freeway to the Temescal Freeway, completing the proposed freeway corridor that is now SR57. When the entire route, except Route240 which was still part of I-210, was redesignated SR57 in the 1964 renumbering, none of these proposed freeways had been built; the only constructed segment was the old surface road from Fullerton towards Pomona. The part of old Route19 east of Route272 became part of SR 60. As part of the same renumbering, Route180 on State College Boulevard became Route250, which was amended the next year to provide for its deletion once that portion of the SR57 freeway was completed (between I-5 and SR 91).|$|E
5|$|What is now U.S. Route 322 {{east of the}} Route 42 {{junction}} {{was established}} in 1855 as the Black Horse Pike, a turnpike that ran from Camden to Atlantic City via Blackwoodtown. In 1923, the portion <b>of</b> <b>present</b> US 322 along the US 40 concurrency was designated {{as a part of}} pre-1927 Route 18S, a route that was built to connect Penns Grove to Atlantic City. As a result of the creation of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, U.S. Route 40 was also signed along the alignment Route 18S. A year later, in the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, the current alignment of US 322 through New Jersey was designated as a part of Route 42 between Williamstown and McKee City, while Route 48 replaced the Route 18S designation along the portion between McKee City and Atlantic City. The portion of US 40/US 322 in Atlantic City was legislated as Route 55 in 1938.|$|E

At Worcester, a new cathedral {{was built in the}} Norman style from 1084, but the crypt contains re-used stonework and columns from its two Saxon predecessor churches. Elsewhere, the abbey church of Sherborne preserves much masonry from the former Saxon cathedral, in the west front, transepts and crossing, so that the nave and crossing <b>of</b> <b>present</b> late medieval abbey retains the proportions of the previous Saxon structure.|$|E
