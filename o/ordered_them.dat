5|$|Just before midnight, 120–135 marines {{arrived at}} the station and {{reported}} to the governor, who <b>ordered</b> <b>them</b> to set about capturing {{the leaders of the}} mob. Governor Carroll telegraphed and advised President Hayes that order had been restored in the city.|$|E
5|$|With the cataphracts' {{attention}} fixated elsewhere, Lucullus formed two cohorts into maniples {{and then}} <b>ordered</b> <b>them</b> to ford across the river. His {{objective was to}} outflank Tigranes' cataphracts by circling counterclockwise around the hill and attacking them from the rear.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the main}} {{features}} of The Things gameplay is the inclusion of multiple NPCs who join Blake at various points throughout the game. At any one time, the player can control up to four characters; Blake and three NPCs. There are three types of NPC in the game; engineers, soldiers and medics. Engineers can repair fuse boxes, which control locked doors, computers and save points. Soldiers have more health, and are better shots than engineers or medics. They are thus more suited to combat. Medics are capable of healing both Blake and any other injured NPCs, and carry unlimited health packs. The player can issue basic commands to each NPC, such as <b>ordering</b> <b>them</b> to follow Blake, <b>ordering</b> <b>them</b> remain where they are, <b>ordering</b> <b>them</b> to give Blake their weapon, and, {{in the case of}} engineers, <b>ordering</b> <b>them</b> to fix a fuse box.|$|R

5|$|Building {{a castle}} {{sometimes}} required {{the permission of}} the king or other high authority. In 864 the King of West Francia, Charles the Bald, prohibited the construction of castella without his permission and <b>ordered</b> <b>them</b> all to be destroyed. This is perhaps the earliest reference to castles, though military historian R. Allen Brown points out that the word castella may have applied to any fortification at the time.|$|E
5|$|Mansour {{assumed the}} {{directorship}} on December 29, 1982, pending Michigan legislative confirmation in the position. Archbishop Szoka hardened his resolve, on February 23, 1983, directed the Detroit Province of the Sisters of Mercy {{to determine whether}} Mansour was {{in violation of the}} teachings of the Church. He told the Detroit Sisters leadership that Mansour no longer had his permission to serve the state, and he <b>ordered</b> <b>them</b> to inform her that she was to resign the state appointment.|$|E
5|$|On {{the day of}} {{the landing}} at Gallipoli, 25 April 1915, Godley came ashore on Gallipoli at midday. Consulting with Major General William Bridges that afternoon, Godley was of the view that the Allied forces, dealing with stiffer than {{expected}} resistance, should be evacuated ahead of an expected attack by Turkish forces the next morning. Although Bridges agreed with Godley, the commander of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force, Sir Ian Hamilton, <b>ordered</b> <b>them</b> to hold fast.|$|E

5|$|Sheriff Porttens {{was outraged}} {{that the police}} fled and rounded up the {{officers}} who were missing and <b>ordered</b> <b>them</b> to protect the streetcars, but thirty-three resigned rather than follow the order. Mayor Shank supported the police mutiny and their refusal to protect the streetcars. He insisted that the situation required Governor Ralston to take action. Without police protection, the Traction and Terminal Company shut down operations and refused to restart them until adequate protection could be provided.|$|E
5|$|Within minutes Calypso {{had also}} veered its cable so that Italienne, now beached, could resume {{fire on the}} British squadron, but the frigate overcompensated and drifted stern-first onto the shore. The British ships {{continued}} their fire until the rapidly falling tide forced them to retire one by one, with Defiance being the last to retire at 12:15. The squadron then returned for one more pass, the final shots fired by Donegal, before Stopford <b>ordered</b> <b>them</b> to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|After {{a futile}} attempt to {{approach}} Herald Island, the ship began the journey back to Alaska; {{next day she}} encountered Bear, with Bartlett aboard. McConnell records that the party were unanimous in their desire to remain with the ship that had effected their rescue, but Bartlett <b>ordered</b> <b>them</b> aboard Bear. Before returning to Alaska, Bear made a final attempt to reach Herald Island; ice limited their approach to , and they saw no signs of life. The reunited party arrived at Nome on 13 September, to a great welcome from the local population.|$|E

5|$|As the {{deadline}} passed on April 2, Melkonian's armor entered the intersection and encountered {{a line of}} Azeri tanks and infantry. A firefight ensued but lasted for only several minutes as the defense line was soon battered and destroyed. Many of the Azeri forces were ill-prepared for the attack as Melkonian noted when pointing out to their lack of equipment. Despite having his force reduced down {{to a total of}} sixty-eight men, a force too weak to take the capital, he <b>ordered</b> <b>them</b> to continue forward.|$|E
5|$|Barrett {{told the}} men to load their weapons but not to fire unless fired upon, and then <b>ordered</b> <b>them</b> to advance. Laurie ordered the British {{companies}} guarding the bridge to retreat across it. One officer then tried to pull up the loose planks of the bridge to impede the colonial advance, but Major Buttrick began to yell at the regulars to stop harming the bridge. The Minutemen and militia from Concord, Acton {{and a handful of}} Westford Minutemen, advanced in column formation, two by two, led by Major Buttrick, Lt. Col. Robinson, then Capt. Davis, on the light infantry, keeping to the road, since it was surrounded by the spring floodwaters of the Concord River.|$|E
5|$|Endeavour then resumed her voyage westward {{along the}} coast, picking {{a path through}} {{intermittent}} shoals and reefs {{with the help of}} the pinnace, which was rowed ahead to test the water depth. By 26 August she was out of sight of land, and had entered the open waters of the Torres Strait between Australia and New Guinea, earlier navigated by Luis Váez de Torres in 1606. To keep Endeavours voyages and discoveries secret, Cook confiscated the log books and journals of all on board and <b>ordered</b> <b>them</b> to remain silent about where they had been.|$|E

5|$|In 1660 Charles II was {{restored}} to the throne and ownership of the castles changed once again. Beaumaris {{was restored}} to {{the control of the}} Bulkeley family, traditionally the constables of the castle, who promptly stripped the castle of any remaining materials, including the roofs, and Conwy was returned to the Conway family, who stripped down the castle for lead and timber, reducing it to a ruin as well. Charles' new government regarded Caernarfon's castle and town walls as a security risk and <b>ordered</b> <b>them</b> to be destroyed, but this order was never carried out, possibly because of the costs involved in doing so.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's team {{arrived in}} Australia {{towards the end}} of 1945, but the armed {{services}} and Australian Board of Control <b>ordered</b> <b>them</b> to play another series against the various Australian states. Johnson had sought fixtures for his team in Australia, but this was before the Evatt had added the matches in the subcontinent. He implored the administrators to recognise that the players were already overworked, but was ignored. The Services performed poorly; after playing out consecutive draws against Western Australia and South Australia, they were crushed by an innings by both Victoria and New South Wales, before drawing against Queensland and Tasmania, the smallest state in the country.|$|E
5|$|North Vietnamese {{attention}} then {{shifted to}} Ranger South, where 400 South Vietnamese troops, including the 109 survivors of Ranger North, held the outpost {{for another two}} days before General Lãm <b>ordered</b> <b>them</b> to fight their way five kilometers southeast to FSB 30. Another casualty of the battle, although an indirect one, was South Vietnamese General Đỗ Cao Trí, commander of III Corps and hero of the Cambodian campaign. Ordered by President Thieu to take over for the outclassed Lãm, Trí died in a helicopter crash on 23 February while en route to his new command.|$|E
50|$|The terms row-major and column-major {{stem from}} the {{terminology}} related to grouping objects. A general way to order objects with many attributes is to first group and <b>order</b> <b>them</b> by one attribute, and then, within each such group, group and <b>order</b> <b>them</b> by another attribute, etc. If more than one attribute participate in ordering, the first would be called major and the last minor. If two attributes participate in ordering, it is sufficient to name only the major attribute.|$|R

5|$|On January 6, 2009, Coleman's {{campaign}} {{filed an}} election contest, {{which led to}} a trial before a three-judge panel. The trial ended on April 7, when the panel ruled that 351 of 387 disputed absentee ballots were incorrectly rejected and <b>ordered</b> <b>them</b> counted. Counting those ballots raised Franken's lead to 312 votes. Coleman appealed to the Minnesota Supreme Court on April 20. On April 24, the Minnesota Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. Oral arguments were conducted on June 1.|$|E
5|$|One {{adviser to}} Khrushchev was Trofim Lysenko, who promised greatly {{increased}} production with minimal investment. Such schemes were attractive to Khrushchev, who <b>ordered</b> <b>them</b> implemented. Lysenko managed {{to maintain his}} influence under Khrushchev despite repeated failures; as each proposal failed, he advocated another. Lysenko's influence greatly retarded the development of genetic science in the Soviet Union. In 1959, Khrushchev announced a goal of overtaking the United States in production of milk, meat, and butter. Local officials, with Khrushchev's encouragement, made unrealistic pledges of production. These goals were met by forcing farmers to slaughter their breeding herds and by purchasing meat at state stores, then reselling {{it back to the}} government, artificially increasing recorded production.|$|E
5|$|Pembroke lodged his {{prisoner}} in Deddington in Oxfordshire. On 10 June, while Pembroke was away, Warwick forcibly carried away Gaveston to Warwick Castle. Here, {{in the presence}} of Warwick, Lancaster and other magnates, Gaveston was sentenced to death at an improvised court. On 19 June he was taken to a place called Blacklow Hillon Lancaster's landsand decapitated. According to the Annales Londonienses chronicle, four shoemakers brought the corpse back to Warwick, but he refused to accept it, and <b>ordered</b> <b>them</b> to take it back to where they found it. Gaveston's body was eventually taken to Oxford by some Dominican friars, and in 1315, King Edward finally had it buried at Kings Langley.|$|E
