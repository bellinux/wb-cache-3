50|$|Gowland {{began work}} in Osaka on 8 October 1872 on the three-year {{contract}} that {{was typical of}} many of the foreigners employed to aid the modernisation of Japan. His contract was repeatedly extended, and he stayed for 16 years, during which time he introduced techniques for the scientific analysis of metals, the production of bronze and copper alloys for coinage, and modern technologies such as the reverberatory furnace for improving the efficiency <b>of</b> <b>refining</b> <b>copper</b> ores. His expertise extended to areas outside the Japan Mint, and he also served as a consultant to the Imperial Japanese Army, helping to establish the Osaka Arsenal for production of artillery. In 1883, he was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun (4th class) by the Japanese government.|$|R
50|$|Given {{this more}} {{favourable}} context, Phelps Dodge, a United States mining {{company and the}} Sumitomo Metal Mining Company, a Japanese firm, signed a US$1.5 billion contract in 1992 with the Chilean government to develop La Candelaria, a copper and gold mine south of Copiapó. The mine's potential production <b>of</b> <b>refined</b> <b>copper</b> was equivalent to about 10 percent of Codelco's entire production.|$|E
50|$|Two {{developments}} in the copper sector were noteworthy. First, in the 1987-91 period, there was {{a substantial increase in}} the output <b>of</b> <b>refined</b> <b>copper,</b> as well as a relative decline in the production of blister copper. Second, the state-owned Copper Corporation (Corporación del Cobre—Codelco), the world's largest copper producer, still had an overwhelmingly dominant role (accounting for 60 percent of Chile's copper output in 1991).|$|E
50|$|Initial {{production}} {{began in}} June 2006, processing material from 56 dumps and tailings dams at Ruashi and Etoile. There were delays in ramp-up, {{mainly caused by}} a shortage of water.The mine had been taking water from open cast pits. Ruashi had to install pipelines to access water from deeper in the pits, and had to drill boreholes to gain a predictable supply.In the year ended 30 June 2008, Ruashi produced 10,767 tonnes of copper.Production of copper and cobalt from tailings near the Ruashi Mine continued until December 2008.The second phase, mining the Ruashi ore body, started {{in the second half}} of 2008, with refining at the new SX/EW plant.21,371 tonnes <b>of</b> <b>refined</b> <b>copper</b> were produced in 2009.Planned production levels from 2010 to 2013 were 36,000 tonnes per year <b>of</b> <b>refined</b> <b>copper</b> and 4,500 tonnes per year of contained cobalt.As of 2010 the mine had access to about 13.3 million tons of ore, graded at 2.9% copper and 0.43% cobalt.On this basis, the project had a life of about ten years.|$|E

50|$|Electrolytic <b>refining</b> <b>of</b> <b>copper</b> {{was first}} {{patented}} in England by James Elkington in 1865 {{and the first}} electrolytic copper refinery was built in Newark, New Jersey, in 1883.|$|R
5|$|Selenium is most {{commonly}} produced from selenide in many sulfide ores, {{such as those}} of copper, nickel, or lead. Electrolytic metal refining is particularly productive of selenium as a byproduct, obtained from the anode mud of copper refineries. Another source was the mud from the lead chambers of sulfuric acid plants, a process that is no longer used. Selenium can be refined from these muds by a number of methods. However, most elemental selenium comes as a byproduct <b>of</b> <b>refining</b> <b>copper</b> or producing sulfuric acid. Since its invention, solvent extraction and electrowinning (SX/EW) production of copper produces an increasing share of the worldwide copper supply. This changes the availability of selenium because only a comparably small part of the selenium in the ore is leached with the copper.|$|R
50|$|The Pittsburgh and Boston Copper Harbor Mining Company and its {{successor}} the Pittsburgh and Boston Mining Company {{operated the}} Cliff mine from 1845 to 1870, then sold {{the property to}} the Cliff Copper Company in 1871. The Cliff Copper Company operated the mine from 1872 to 1878. The combined dividends paid by the companies was $2.5 million. The mine was then leased to tributers, who continued minor copper production through 1887. Total production was 38.2 million pounds <b>of</b> <b>refined</b> <b>copper.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1989 {{the mines}} {{production}} rate of 120000 t <b>of</b> <b>refined</b> <b>copper</b> accounted for 1.7% of the world's copper supply (seven million tons produced globally).

50|$|The Kvikne Copper Works at Kvikne in Hedmark, Norway were {{operated}} from 1630, {{and were}} the largest copper works in Norway in the mid-17th century. The ore discovery was reported in 1629. The first mines were called Gabe Gottes and Segen Gottes. Gabe Gottes collapsed in 1677, and in 1682 the copper works suffered severe economic losses as a ship's load of copper was taken by pirates. In 1789 the mines were largely damaged by the flooding disaster Storofsen, and this virtually ended {{the operation of the}} mines.

50|$|The {{production}} <b>of</b> <b>refined</b> <b>copper</b> {{was expected}} to rise {{by an average of}} 17% per year from 2005 to 2011. Zambia’s production is expected to increase because of higher output from the Mufulira refinery and the Bwana Mkubwa and the Kansanshi solvent extraction-electrowinning (SX-EW) plants in 2006 and the Konkola SX-EW plants by 2007. In Congo (Kinshasa), new SX-EW plants could open at the Kolwezi Tailings project and the Mutoshi Mine in early 2008, and at the KOV Mine in late 2009. CAMEC planned to start production at the Luita plant in 2008.
