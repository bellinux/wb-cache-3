5|$|During a June 2007 {{visit to}} the {{predominantly}} Muslim Albania, Bush was greeted enthusiastically. Albania {{has a population of}} 2.8million, has troops in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and the country's government is highly supportive of American foreign policy. A huge image of the President was hung {{in the middle of the}} capital city of Tirana flanked by Albanian and American flags while a local street was named after him. A shirt-sleeved statue <b>of</b> <b>Bush</b> was unveiled in Fushë-Krujë, a few kilometers northwest of Tirana. The Bush administration's support for the independence of Albanian-majority Kosovo, while endearing him to the Albanians, has troubled U.S. relations with Serbia, leading to the February 2008 torching of the U.S. embassy in Belgrade.|$|E

40|$|Some exact {{interactions}} between vibrational modes in systems with discrete symmetry {{can be described}} by the theory <b>of</b> the <b>bushes</b> <b>of</b> nonlinear normal modes (NNMs) [G. M. Chechin, V. P. Sakhnenko. Physica D 117, 43 (1998) ]. Each bush represents a dynamical object conserving {{the energy of the}} initial excitation. Existence <b>of</b> <b>bushes</b> <b>of</b> NNMs is ensured by some group-theoretical selection rules. In [G. M. Chechin, et al. Int. J. Non-Linear Mech. 38, 1451 (2003) ], existence and stability <b>of</b> the <b>bushes</b> <b>of</b> vibrational modes in the simple octahedral model of mass points interacting via Lennard-Jones potential were investigated. In the present paper, we study these dynamical objects by the density functional theory in SF 6 molecule which possesses the same symmetry and structure. We have fully confirmed the results previously obtained in the framework of the group theoretical approach and have found some new properties <b>of</b> the <b>bushes</b> <b>of</b> NNMs...|$|R
5|$|The {{architect}} <b>of</b> <b>Bush</b> House was Richard Shackleton Pope, who constructed {{first the}} south {{part of the}} warehouse (1831) then extended it to the north in 1835–1836. Its original use was as a warehouse for local iron foundry D., E. & A. Acraman. The building has a Pennant Sandstone exterior with arched ground level entrances and arched windows above. This style of architecture is the first example of the Bristol Byzantine style which became popular in the 1850s. Later conversion to a tea warehouse added interstitial floors.|$|E

But they stand as the fullest story yet of the Bush presidency and of the war that is likely to be its most important legacy.|$|E
5|$|As {{the family}} eats breakfast the next morning, Lois reveals her {{intention}} {{to become a}} surrogate mother for Naomi and Dale, causing Peter to become upset {{at the thought of}} her being pregnant for nine months. Despite this, Lois decides to go to Dr. Hartman to have the in vitro fertilization performed, enduring more of Dr. Hartman's shtick involving celebrity crossbreeds and having a tribe <b>of</b> <b>bush</b> men implant the egg with blowguns. A pregnancy test comes back positive the next day, and a furious Peter attempts to cause Lois to have a miscarriage before ultimately confronting her about the pregnancy. While she continues asserting her intention to provide a child to Naomi and Dale, Quahog 5 News suddenly reveals that Naomi and Dale died in a car crash on Interstate 95. Devastated by the announcement, Lois questions whether she should have an abortion or continue with the pregnancy and put the baby up for adoption.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Power {{transformer}} {{is the key}} {{equipment in}} power system. In view of the issues <b>of</b> the current <b>bushing</b> monitoring method, a new detection method <b>of</b> <b>bushing</b> insulation defects is proposed in this paper. According to the internal structure <b>of</b> <b>bushing,</b> the internal insulation defects are divided into three categories, including partial moisture, pollution, local insulation defects, the outer insulation <b>of</b> the <b>bushing</b> is equivalent to a resistance chain model. The entire bushing insulation is considered as a parallel between inner insulation and external insulation (inner Insulation is the main). This detection makes uses of the transient voltage measured from transformer bushing and the transient current measured from the end shield down-lead as the signal source. The reference data dynamically generated is used to diagnosis and distinguish Insulation defects <b>of</b> Transformer <b>bushing,</b> according to the monitoring data <b>of</b> the <b>bushing</b> and the maximum of the reference data, the type <b>of</b> the <b>bushing</b> insulation defect and the severity can be sentenced. A large number of simulation results initially confirmed the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} on-line monitoring for condenser type <b>bushing</b> <b>of</b> power transformer in order to detect a degradation <b>of</b> <b>bushing</b> and to provide the alarm before bushing failure. For the bushing degradation analysis, the capacitance and power factor <b>of</b> <b>bushing</b> internal insulation are on-line monitored and measured by installing the sensing device at the test tap <b>of</b> <b>bushing.</b> The changing <b>of</b> internal insulation capacitance leads to the change of voltage across tap capacitor and the change of leakage current through bushing insulation at the test tab. Such changes result in the change of power factor or phase angle of leakage current. Thus, the leakage current is additionally detected by installing the Hall Effect sensing device to observe the trend <b>of</b> <b>bushing</b> failure. A total of eight cases of both normal and degraded insulation are investigated. The internal insulation capacitance {{as well as the}} magnitude and phase angle of three phase leakage current were measured and compared with the commissioning value or observed the increasing trend to set the alarm level. In case <b>of</b> degraded <b>bushing,</b> the leakage currents changed and caused the summation of leakage current value to be greater than the standard value. Then the alarm is activated. This knowledge was used to develop the detection and decision making algorithms in LabVIEW program to determine the condition <b>of</b> transformer <b>bushing...</b>|$|R

5|$|Like other insects, flies have chemoreceptors that detect {{smell and}} taste, and mechanoreceptors that respond to touch. The third {{segments}} of the antennae and the maxillary palps bear the main olfactory receptors, while the gustatory receptors are in the labium, pharynx, feet, wing margins and female genitalia, enabling flies to taste their food by walking on it. The taste receptors in females {{at the tip of}} the abdomen receive information on the suitability of a site for ovipositing. Flies that feed on blood have special sensory structures that can detect infrared emissions, and use them to home in on their hosts, and many blood-sucking flies can detect the raised concentration of carbon dioxide that occurs near large animals. Some tachinid flies (Ormiinae) which are parasitoids <b>of</b> <b>bush</b> crickets, have sound receptors to help them locate their singing hosts.|$|E
5|$|Numerous fady protect {{wilderness}} areas, particularly {{including the}} Ankarana massif. Excessive cutting of mangrove trees for wood or the setting <b>of</b> <b>bush</b> fires are both prohibited, {{as is the}} use of nets with holes less than 15 millimeters to prevent catching immature fish. Certain species are protected through fady that forbid hunting them, including sharks, rays and crocodiles. Many fady also exist to regulate relations between the sexes. For instance, it is taboo for a girl to wash her own brother's clothing. Conservative communities adhere to a fady against medical injections, surgery or modern medicines due to their association with their historic enemies the Merina, who were the first to use them widely; instead, tromba ceremonies and traditional herbal remedies are commonly used for healing. These taboos are most strongly applied in the center of Antankarana territory around the village of Ambatoharaña and less so in the villages at the periphery of the region.|$|E
5|$|Parsons was {{appointed}} {{the head of}} Ordnance and Engineering Division in June 1943 on the recommendation <b>of</b> <b>Bush</b> and Conant. To staff the division, Tolman, who acted as a coordinator of the gun development effort, brought in John Streib, Charles Critchfield and Seth Neddermeyer from the National Bureau of Standards. The division was initially organized into five groups, with original group leaders being McMillan of the E-1 (Proving Ground) Group, Kenneth Bainbridge of the E-2 (Instrumentation) Group, Robert Brode of the E-3 (Fuse Development) Group, Critchfield of the E-4 (Projectile, Target, and Source) Group and Neddermeyer of the E-5 (Implosion) Group. Two more groups were added {{in the autumn of}} 1943, the E-7 (Delivery) Group under Norman Ramsey and the E-8 (Interior Ballistics) Group under Joseph O. Hirschfelder.|$|E

5|$|Townsend {{subsequently}} then {{reported that}} he was facing a force of at least battalion-strength with support weapons—likely D445 Battalion—while the level of proficiency indicated that it might also include North Vietnamese Army (NVA) elements. However, due to earlier warnings that the Viet Cong were preparing to attack Nui Dat that evening, {{prior to the start}} of the operation Graham had ordered Townsend to return to base that afternoon, and this restriction remained extant. Likewise, with Operation Renmark scheduled to start the following morning, A Company 5 RAR—then at Dat Do protecting the artillery—would also need to be released before nightfall, adding to the requirement to conclude the operation that afternoon. Regardless, this restriction had only served to make B Company's task all the more difficult, with Mackay facing demands to complete the action while at the same time not become decisively engaged and unable to withdraw his company. At 16:17 Townsend was ordered to prepare his battalion for a helicopter extraction which was due to begin an hour later, while at 17:15 he was ordered to break contact immediately, however this proved impossible as 5 Platoon remained in heavy contact. Mackay now estimated that he would be unable to get forward to support the beleaguered platoon for a further 30 minutes; however, by 17:50 he realised that the Viet Cong had moved between them and A Company. Yet even while the Viet Cong continued to heavily engage both A and B Companies, the remainder of the Australian battalion and the APCs were beginning to line up on the landing zone in preparation for returning to Nui Dat. The order was finally rescinded when it became clear that both companies were unable to break-off the engagement. Meanwhile, a number <b>of</b> <b>bush</b> fires were now burning through the area, detonating discarded ammunition and adding to the noise of the battle.|$|E
