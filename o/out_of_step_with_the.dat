5|$|Historically, Ashland {{has been}} {{something}} of a political outlier in southwest Oregon. In the presidential election of 1860, Ashland favored Abraham Lincoln while its neighbors strongly preferred pro-slavery candidates. In the early 1900s, Ashland voters supported women's suffrage and prohibition, generally <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>step</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rest of the region. In more recent elections, liberal Ashland has supported tax levies and environmental regulations opposed by voters elsewhere in Jackson and nearby counties. Critics sometimes refer to the city as the People's Republic of Ashland.|$|E

McCartney is barefoot and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>step</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> other members. Apart from Harrison, the group are wearing suits designed by Tommy Nutter. To the left of the picture, parked next to the zebra crossing, is a white Volkswagen Beetle which belonged to one of the people living in the block of flats across from the recording studio. After the album was released, the number plate (LMW 281F) was stolen repeatedly from the car. In 1986, the car was sold at auction for £2,530 and in 2001 was on display in a museum in Germany. The man standing on the pavement {{to the right of the}} picture is Paul Cole (7 July 1911– 13 February 2008), an American tourist unaware he had been photographed until he saw the album cover months later. On the original cover, McCartney holds a cigarette; in 2003 several US poster companies airbrushed this cigarette out of the image, without permission from either Apple or McCartney.|$|E

5|$|On days of {{particular}} religious significance, the daily rituals were replaced with festival observances. Different festivals occurred at different intervals, though most were annual. Their timing {{was based on}} the Egyptian civil calendar, which most of the time was far <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>step</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> astronomical year. Thus, while many festivals had a seasonal origin, their timing lost its connection with the seasons. Most festivals took place at a single temple, but others could involve two or more temples or an entire region of Egypt; a few were celebrated throughout the country. In the New Kingdom and later, the festival calendar at a single temple could include dozens of events, so it is likely that most of these events were observed only by the priests. In those festivals that involved a procession outside the temple, the local population also gathered to watch and to celebrate. These were the most elaborate temple ceremonies, accompanied by the recitation of hymns and the performance of musicians.|$|E

Atmospheric loading and storm events may also be measurable, though the masses in movement are less weighty.|$|E
25|$|By 1921–2 the {{coalition}} had become embroiled {{in an air}} of moral and financial corruption (e.g. the sale of honours). Besides the recent Irish Treaty and Edwin Montagu's moves towards greater self-government for India, both of which dismayed rank-and-file Conservative opinion, the government's willingness to intervene against the Bolshevik regime in Russia also seemed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>step</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> new and more pacifist mood. A sharp slump in 1921 and a wave of strikes in the coal and railway industries also added to the government's unpopularity, as did the apparent failure of the Genoa Conference, which ended in an apparent rapprochement between Germany and Soviet Russia. In other words, {{it was no longer}} the case that Lloyd George was an electoral asset to the Conservative Party.|$|E

David Sinclair left after the album was recorded {{and was replaced}} by Jan Schelhaas, with the band's sound becoming more mainstream.

25|$|Initially, {{vocational}} education in Singapore carried a negative stigma and was {{looked down upon}} as a dead-end option for underachieving students. In the 1960s, it was considered less than socially desirable educational option as {{vocational education}} was perceived that these schools were for low achieving students. Societal prejudice against less academically inclined students and vocational educational was regarded low quality and typically <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>step</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> changing needs of employers. The perception of technical and vocational education in Singapore are slowly changing as parents are starting {{to realize that there}} are alternative choices for decent employment outcomes as the greater Singaporean society values vocational and technical skills highly and sees them as crucial to the country’s economic development. Vocational education has been an important part of Singapore’s unique economic planning since 1992, where it began to transform and change the perception of vocational education and decided to transform and preposition it so that it was not seen as a place of last resort for underachieving pupils. Vocational schools such as the Institute of Technical Education were intended to revolutionize vocational education and portray the institution as a world-class example of the importance of vocational skills being translated to a 21st-century knowledge-based economy. Since 1995, enrollment in vocational schools has doubled, now making up 65% of the cohort who go on to post-secondary education (ages 16–18), with 25% accepted into the ITE and another 40% attending polytechnic universities.|$|E

500|$|Rockwell is {{considered}} the [...] "quintessential middlebrow American artist". As an artist he is an illustrator rather than a fine arts painter. [...] Although his style is painterly, his work is produced {{for the purpose of}} mass reproduction, and it is produced with the intent of delivering a common message to its viewers via a detailed narrative style. [...] Furthermore, the vast majority of Rockwell's work was viewed in reproduced format and almost none of his contemporaneous audience ever saw his original work. [...] Also, Rockwell's style of backwoods New England small-town realism, known as regionalism, was sometimes viewed as <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>step</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> oncoming wave of abstract modern art. Some say his realism is so direct that he abstains from using artistic license. [...] John Canaday, a New York Times art critic once referred to Rockwell as the [...] "Rembrandt of Punkin' Crick" [...] for his aversion to the vices of big city life. Dave Hickey derided Rockwell for painting without inflection. [...] Some critics also view his sentimental and nostalgic vision <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>step</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> harsh realities of American life, such as the Great Depression. Deborah Solomon views the works as being [...] "based on lofty civic principles", but rather than dealing with the warring patriots, they present themes with [...] "civic and familial rituals" [...] for [...] "emblematic scenes".|$|E

Childs later remarked that Verity Lambert [...] "didn't {{want to come in}} and just do the same old routine – the kick bollock and scramble action adventure stuff that made the early name of the company".

500|$|Whittall {{believes}} {{that one reason}} for Britten's enduring popularity is the [...] "progressive conservatism" [...] of his music.

Perhaps, says Brett, [...] "the tide that swept away serialism, atonality and most forms of musical modernism and brought in neo-Romanticism, minimalism and other modes of expression involved with tonality carried with it renewed interest in composers who had been <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>step</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> times".
