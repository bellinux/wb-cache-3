40|$|Using econometric evidence, {{this article}} {{confirms}} that distribution of medicines online is {{split into two}} market segments of very diverse quality, and identifies the factors that drive quality and quality assurance in this activity. Unlike fraudulent, ‘rogue,’ websites, which offer scant guarantees and usually sell just a few medicines without prescription, <b>online</b> <b>pharmacies</b> offering insurance coverage and linked to conventional pharmacies typically sell {{a whole range of}} drugs, require third-party medical prescriptions and provide abundant information to patients. It is shown that, where <b>online</b> <b>pharmacies</b> are allowed to act legally, market forces enhance quality, as private insurers require professional standards, and specialized third parties make a business of certifying them. Furthermore, older <b>online</b> <b>pharmacies</b> and those running conventional operations offer higher quality, probably because of reputational investments. Overall, this evidence supports licensing <b>online</b> <b>pharmacies,</b> especially considering that prohibiting them is ineffective against fraudulent sites.

40|$|Background: <b>Online</b> <b>pharmacies</b> are {{companies}} that sell pharmaceutical preparations, including prescription-only drugs, on the Internet. Very {{little is known}} about this phenomenon because many <b>online</b> <b>pharmacies</b> operate from remote countries, where legal bases and business practices are largely inaccessible to international research. Objective: The aim {{of the study was to}} perform an up-to-date and comprehensive review of the scientific literature focusing on the broader picture of <b>online</b> <b>pharmacies</b> by scanning several scientific and institutional databases, with no publication time limits. Methods: We searched 4 electronic databases up to January 2011 and the gray literature on the Internet using the Google search engine and its tool Google Scholar. We also investigated the official websites of institutional agencies (World Health Organization, and US and European centers for disease control and drug regulation authorities). We focused specifically on <b>online</b> <b>pharmacies</b> offering prescription-only drugs. We decided to analyze and report only articles with original data, in order to review all the available data regarding <b>online</b> <b>pharmacies</b> and their usage. Results: We selected 193 relevant articles: 76 articles with original data, and 117 articles without original data (editorials, regulation articles, or the like) including 5 reviews. The articles with original data cover samples of <b>online</b> <b>pharmacies</b> in 47 cases, online drug purchases in 13, consumer characteristics in 15, and case reports on adverse effects of online drugs in 12. The studies show that random samples with no specific limits to prescription requirements found that at least some websites sold drugs without a prescription and that an online questionnaire was a frequent tool to replace prescription. Data about geographical characteristics show that this information can be concealed in many websites. The analysis of drug offer showed that online a consumer can get virtually everything. Regarding quality of drugs, researchers very often found inappropriate packaging and labeling, whereas the chemical composition usually was not as expected in a minority of the studies’ samples. Regarding consumers, the majority of studies found that not more than 6...|$|R
