[...] This was the second edition of The World Atlas, first published in 1954. Although {{a lot of other}} atlases were published during the years in the Soviet Union under the name [...] "Atlas Mira" [...] (including pocket atlases), this one is the biggest and most detailed and might be probably denoted as [...] "Great Atlas of the World" [...] to distinguish it from all other smaller editions. Still on the cover it simply reads The World Atlas below the coat of arms of the Soviet Union in relief. It was published simultaneously in Russian and English in 25,000 copies and was priced at 42 Soviet rubles. Special cartographic paper and special cartographic offset ink were used. The Atlas was dedicated to the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution. The Atlas has a full 250 pages of colour maps, majority of them physical, the index being a separate book, comprising some 200,000 entries. The size of the Atlas is 55 x 32 cm. [...] The maps in the Atlas are arranged in groups starting with general world maps, maps of the Soviet Union and maps of the continents. The world maps are in the 1:50,000,000 scale. The Soviet Union is treated basically as a separate continent with its own physical, political, transportation and time zone maps. It is mentioned in the preface that the number of the maps of the Soviet Union is decreased compared to the previous edition, because of the interim publishing of a separate atlas specifically dedicated to the Soviet Union. For each continent there is a general physical map as an introduction (1:10,000,000 to 1:25,000,000), followed by political and communications maps. This is followed by a number of general regional maps (1:1,500,000 to 1:750,000) and supplemented for important areas by large scale maps (1:250,000 to 1:750,000). 18 different colours are used from deep blue for the <b>ocean</b> <b>deeps</b> to dark brown and white for the highest mountains and glaciers. Relief shading is used for delineating relief along with contour lines. All scales are metric. Tint for elevation is predominately used in larger scale maps: 1:1,500,000 and higher. The shadows and colours combined give an almost stereo impression, the relief popping up out of the pages. Many major cities in the world are shown on separate maps or insets, typically in 1:250,000 scale as well as important areas like the Panama Canal or Palestine, along with detailed maps of small islands in the world oceans.|$|E

Because of the potential energy of soil in elevated positions and because of the kinetic energy of water flowing under the influence of gravity, eroded material is eventually transported to the lowest possible level, i. e. the <b>ocean</b> <b>deeps,</b> or some intervening basin. This denudation process may be compared with Newton’s second law of thermodynamics which states that each system tends to move in the direction of lowest energy. Sedimentation in intervening basins may be seen as part of the natural process of landscape evolution. The rates at which sedimentation occurs may be strongly influenced by the activities of man...|$|E

Previous works showed that Recent Quaternary sediments originated from Kalimantan and Sulawesi. These deposits are associated either with settling processes or with paleogeographic events related to eustatic variations. At low sea level, gravity flow from Kalimantan supply deep-sea zones where deposits are arranged locally in stratodecreasing successions. During {{the rise of the}} sea level, inputs change both qualitatively and quantitatively. In addition to river-borne inputs (Mahakam), one can observe reworked sediments originating from the continental shelf in the course of its immersion.

40|$|THE CONCEPTION of {{a rain of}} diatoms {{from the}} {{plankton}} to the <b>ocean</b> <b>deeps</b> is, at first (hought, a reasonable one. Further thought, however, makes it appear extremely unlikely. Because diatoms occur in swarms, particularly in {{certain areas of the}} oceans, it seems to have been assumed that they descend more or less vertically to form diatomaceous ooze. In fact, in deeper waters, we could expect them to become widely dispersed, especially as their form is such as to retard vertical movement. Further, {{there is the question of}} the gradient of silica concentration with depth, and the effect of pressure thereon. Harvey (1945) states that the silica content of seawater, in general, has been found to increase with depth, and that it is probably in true rather than colloidal solution. This suggests that the dia-tom tests are dissolved as they fall through the water after the death of the cell. Wiseman and Hendey (1953) found large numbers of the diatom Ethmodiscus rex (Rat-tray) Hendey in material collected from the Mariana Trench by H. M. S. "Challenger " in 195 L These authors speculate regarding the origin of the tests, pointing out that E. rex is rare in the plankton, and that, "there is no indication that the species is found living in the waters immediately over the deposit it-self. " They do not consider the possibility that the diatom is autochthonous...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} multichannel seismic and hydroacoustic data of four survey areas {{along the}} Red Sea Rift and the Dead Sea Transform Fault. Sedimentary Basins that developed {{due to the}} rifting of the Red Sea and the strike-slip displacement of the Dead Sea Transform Fault were investigated and models for their evolution were derived. The Red Sea Rift and the Dead Sea Transform Fault are the main tectonic features in the Middle East. The rifting process of the Red Sea that initiated in the late Oligocene and early Miocene separated the African Plate from the Arabian Plate. In the Middle Miocene, the extension was compensated {{in the northern part}} of the Red Sea with the initiation of the left lateral Dead Sea Transform Fault. Along the Red Sea, different stages of evolution can be observed. Whereas the southern part comprises already seafloor spreading, the northern part is assumed to be in the late stage of continental rifting. Because of huge evaporitic sediment layers within the entire Red Sea, direct basement observations are sparse. Surficial features like <b>ocean</b> <b>deeps</b> along the axis of the Red Sea are interpreted as first seafloor spreading cells in the transition process between seafloor spreading and continental rifting. Along the Dead Sea Transform Fault, 105 km of left lateral displacement are observed within the last 20 Ma. The displacement is most likely not continuous since its onset. The Dead Sea Transform Fault may have experienced a break in its history before 5 Ma [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Skeletal {{muscle is}} able to react in a rapid, dynamic way to {{metabolic}} and mechanical stimuli. In particular, exposure to either prolonged starvation or disuse results in muscle atrophy. At variance, in hibernating animals muscle atrophy may be scarce or absent after bouts of hibernation i. e., periods of prolonged (months) inactivity and food deprivation, and muscle function is fully preserved at arousal. In this study, myocytes from the quadriceps muscle of euthermic and hibernating edible dormice were investigated {{by a combination of}} morphological, morphometrical and immunocytochemical analyses at the light and electron microscopy level. The focus was on cell nuclei and mitochondria, which are highly sensitive markers of changing metabolic rate. Results Findings presented herein demonstrate that: 1) the general histology of the muscle, inclusive of muscle fibre shape and size, and the ratio of fast and slow fibre types are not affected by hibernation; 2) the fine structure of cytoplasmic and nuclear constituents is similar in euthermia and hibernation but for lipid droplets, which accumulate during lethargy; 3) during hibernation, mitochondria are larger in size with longer cristae, and 4) myonuclei maintain the same amount and distribution of transcripts and transcription factors as in euthermia. Conclusion In this study we demonstrate that skeletal muscle cells of the hibernating edible dormouse maintain their structural and functional integrity in full, even after months in the nest. A twofold explanation for that is envisaged: 1) the maintenance, during hibernation, of low-rate nuclear and mitochondrial activity counterbalancing myofibre wasting, 2) the intensive muscle stimulation (shivering) during periodic arousals in the nest, which would mimic physical exercise. These two factors would prevent muscle atrophy usually occurring in mammals after prolonged starvation and/or inactivity as a consequence of prevailing catabolism. Understanding the mechanisms responsible for skeletal muscle preservation in hibernators could pave the way to prevention and treatment of muscle wasting associated with pathological conditions or ageing as well as life in extreme environments, such as <b>ocean</b> <b>deeps</b> or spaceflights. </p...|$|E
