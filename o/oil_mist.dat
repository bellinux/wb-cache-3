40|$|International audienceIn this work, the {{generation}} conditions of lube <b>oil</b> <b>mists</b> by spray, their droplet size distributions and their flammability characteristics were studied. At first, tests {{were carried out}} on brand new lube oil having a viscosity of 32 mm 2. s− 1 at 40 °C (ISO VG 32) and a flashpoint higher than 200 °C. Experiments were performed in a vertical semi-open tube with a 0. 07 m-square cross section connected to ignition systems supplying energies ranging from 1 mJ to 5 kJ. The average droplet diameter, determined using a laser diffraction sensor, ranged from 4 to 60 μm depending on operating parameters. In the case of brand new mineral <b>oil</b> <b>mists,</b> the probability of ignition by a spark discharge {{can be considered as}} low, the minimum ignition energy (MIE) being 2 kJ for 5 μm droplets. The minimum explosive concentration is fairly high, in the order of 250 g. m− 3. For mists with droplet diameters around 60 μm, MIE slightly increases to reach 2. 5 kJ. The flammability of <b>oil</b> <b>mists</b> generated in case of maloperation (accidental fuel/lube mixing) was also studied. The ignition properties of used lube oil were not notably modified with regard to the brand new oil. However, the addition of organic volatiles compounds leads to a modification of mists flammability, nevertheless it is only perceptible for fuel contents greater than 20 %v...|$|R
40|$|Twenty five {{patients}} {{who were exposed to}} <b>oil</b> <b>mists</b> at their place of work were investigated for possible work related asthma. Serial peak expiratory flow recordings showed 13 to have definite work related asthma, seven equivocal work related asthma, and three asthma unrelated to work; two had normal recordings. Subjects with work related asthma often produced different patterns of peak flow response during the working week; patterns also varied between patients. Six of these patients had bronchial tests with oil from their place of work. Three had asthma induced by exposure to unused (clean) soluble oil and one reacted to used but not to clean oil. The challenge tests in the remaining two gave inconclusive results. It is concluded that occupational asthma due to <b>oil</b> <b>mists</b> is common, the peak flow response is heterogeneous, and the provoking agent within the oil may vary from worker to worker...|$|R

40|$|Certain {{paternal}} occupations {{and related}} exposures {{have been suggested}} as possible risk factors for neural tube defects (NTD). We analysed data collected {{as part of a}} case-control study to investigate the relationship between paternal occupational exposures and NTD. Cases were 694 NTD-affected pregnancies diagnosed between 1970 and 1987 in Oxfordshire or West Berkshire, England. Controls were randomly selected from a computerised maternity database individually matched to cases on maternal year of birth and year of index pregnancy. Data on paternal occupation were abstracted from hospital antenatal records. Associations between paternal occupational exposures and NTD were assessed using odds ratios adjusted for maternal year of birth, year of index pregnancy, gender of baby, multiplicity of birth and number of previous obstetric events. Statistically significant positive associations were observed for paternal occupational exposure to agrochemicals and animals. Analysis by occupational title revealed that more case than control fathers were farmers, gardeners and butchers. Statistically significant negative associations were seen for paternal occupational exposure to inhaled hydrocarbons and metal-working <b>oil</b> <b>mists.</b> The findings from this population-based study for paternal agricultural and animal-related occupations overlap and have been previously observed. The apparent protective effects of fathers working with inhaled hydrocarbons and metal-working <b>oil</b> <b>mists</b> have not been previously described. No underlying biological mechanisms have been identified, therefore other explanations cannot be excluded...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] The {{metalworker}} can {{be exposed}} to cutting oils during application by two basic routes of entry: skin contact and inhalation. The higher risk jobs tend to be those with high cutting speeds, heavy oil flow, and continuous contact, which may result in the worker being splashed with oil on the skin or clothing. The oil may remain on the skin {{for some time and}} oil-soaked clothing may be worn all shift. Cutting oils may be applied manually, by an air-carried mist, or by a continuous flood. When flooding is used, the oil is delivered by a pump, piping, and nozzle to the cutting zone. With this method the tool, work, and chip are flooded. (Used fluid is then collected in the chip pan and returned by gravity to the pump sump.) Inhalation of cutting <b>oil</b> <b>mists</b> may occur {{because of the nature of}} coolant delivery or because of the high temperatures and speeds generated at the cutting tool 2 ̆ 7 s working edge. When the mist stream method of coolant delivery is used, much of it evaporates on contact with the hot tool, workpiece or chip. In addition to the intentional production of <b>oil</b> <b>mists,</b> vaporized <b>oil</b> can also be generated by the forces of the rapidly spinning workpiece or tool, or by the vaporization of the fluid from the heat of the cutting process...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{examine the}} {{association}} between paternal occupational exposures and retinoblastoma using birth registration data for cases from the National Registry of Childhood Tumours (NRCT) and controls {{from the general population}} of Great Britain. METHODS: A case-control study of paternal occupational data for 1318 cases of retinoblastoma, born and diagnosed in Great Britain between 1962 and 1999, and 1318 controls matched on sex, date of birth and birth registration sub-district. Paternal occupations at birth were grouped according to inferred exposure using an occupational exposure classification scheme. A conditional (matched) case-control analysis was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) for each paternal occupational exposure group. RESULTS: For non-heritable retinoblastoma, a statistically significant increased risk was found with father's definite occupational exposure to <b>oil</b> <b>mists</b> in metal working (OR = 1. 85 (95 % CI 1. 05 to 3. 36)). Together with a (non-significant) risk (OR = 1. 64 (0. 73 to 3. 83)) amongst the heritable cases, this occupational exposure was also associated with a significant increased risk when all retinoblastoma cases were considered together (OR = 1. 77 (1. 12 to 2. 85)). No statistically significant associations were observed for other exposure groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our finding for exposure to <b>oil</b> <b>mists</b> in metal working (a subset of metal workers) is not directly comparable to those for metal working previously reported in the literature. Overall, our findings do not support the hypothesis that paternal occupational exposure is an important aetiological factor for retinoblastoma, however, the study has low power and other methodological limitations...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Little {{is known}} about {{occupational}} risk factors for meningioma. OBJECTIVES: To study whether risk of meningioma is associated with several occupational exposures, including selected combustion products, dusts and other chemical agents. METHODS: The INTEROCC study was an international case-control study of brain cancer conducted in seven countries. Data collection by interview included lifetime occupational histories. A job exposure matrix was used to derive estimates of exposure for the 12 agents. ORs for ever versus never exposed and for exposure-response using duration of exposure and cumulative exposure were derived using conditional logistic regression stratified by sex, age group, country/region, adjusted for education. RESULTS: These analyses included 1906 cases and 5565 controls. For 11 of the 12 agents, no excess risk was found for ever exposed. For ever exposure to <b>oil</b> <b>mists,</b> an elevated OR of 1. 57 (95 % CI 1. 10 to 2. 22, 51 exposed cases) was found. Statistically significant exposure-response relationships were observed with cumulative exposure (p= 0. 01) and duration of exposure (p= 0. 04). Among women, there were also significant trends for cumulative and duration of exposure to asbestos and excesses in the highest exposure categories for formaldehyde. CONCLUSIONS: Most agents examined did not provoke excess risks of meningioma. The main finding from {{this study is that}} it is the first study to identify a statistical association between exposure to <b>oil</b> <b>mists</b> and meningioma. This may be a chance finding or could be due to confounding with iron exposure and further research is required to understand whether the relationship is causal.

L'objectif de l'étude est drechercher les associations entre les méningiomes et une exposition antérieure à différents composés organiques, poussières et autres agents chimiques...|$|R

50|$|In many vehicles, a {{crankcase}} breather pipe feeds {{into the air}} intake to vent the crankcase without releasing raw hydrocarbon vapors into the atmosphere. In a highly worn engine, hot gases, including unburnt fuel can blow past the piston rings and into the crankcase. This creates an excess <b>oil</b> <b>mist,</b> which is then drawn from the crankcase into the air intake via the breather. A diesel engine will readily burn this <b>oil</b> <b>mist</b> as fuel, since engine oil has similar energy content and combustion properties as diesel fuel. The extra fuel causes the engine revolutions to increase, causing still more <b>oil</b> <b>mist</b> to be {{forced out of the}} crankcase and into the engine, and a positive feedback loop is created.
