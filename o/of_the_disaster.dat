5|$|Days {{after the}} storm, fears of food {{shortages}} began to arise as railways, in which food {{would normally be}} able to be delivered, were washed out. To deal with the large number of bodies in the wake <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>disaster,</b> Mexican officials decided to cremate and mass bury victims. By mid-September, between 1,600 and 1,800 people were hired to repair and rebuild the devastated railways in Nuevo León. In 2009, the third edition of the book El Río Fiera Bramaba: 1909 by Oswaldo Sánchez, re-accounting reports form people who experienced the flood, was planned. According to the director of publications at the Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León, the book was considered one of historical quality. In memory of those who perished during the flood, the book was released to the public on August27, 2009, the 100year anniversary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>disaster.</b>|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} after his death, Scott's status as tragic hero was unchallenged, and few {{questions}} were asked about the causes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>disaster</b> which overcame his polar party. In the final quarter of the 20th century the expedition came under closer scrutiny, and more critical views were expressed about its organization and management. The degree of Scott's personal culpability, and more recently, the culpability of certain expedition members, remain controversial.|$|E
5|$|From {{the onset}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>disaster</b> {{authorities}} provided initial assistance.

5|$|Gibson {{had been}} one of 28 people aboard the first {{lifeboat}} to be launched from Titanic and was rescued about five and a half hours after leaving the ship. On returning to New York City, she co-wrote the script and played a fictionalized version of herself. The plot involves her recounting the story <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>disaster</b> to her fictional parents and fiancé, with the footage interspersed with stock footage of icebergs, Titanics sister ship Olympic and the ship's captain, Edward Smith. To add to the film's authenticity, Gibson wore the same clothes as on the night <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>disaster.</b> The filming took place in a New Jersey studio and aboard a derelict ship in New York Harbor.|$|E
5|$|Gorbachev {{set aside}} 5 billion rubles (about $8 billion U.S. dollars) in {{funds for a}} start on what would likely be a {{recovery}} cost that would exceed the cleanup bill for the 1986 nuclear and radiation accident in Ukraine. While foreign doctors did assist with the Chernobyl incident, the Soviet relief effort after the earthquake was augmented by the largest foreign cooperation since World War II. That deluge of western aid was a byproduct <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>disaster</b> that {{may have had a}} positive effect on Soviet Union–United States relations. The cost of rebuilding would be a severe obstacle for Perestroika, Gorbachev's plan for economic restructuring. Another adverse effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>disaster</b> was that the Armenians were already distrustful of Gorbachev's dismissal of their claims to the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, which the Armenians had been contesting with neighboring Azerbaijan.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>disaster</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{landslides}} and {{the flash}} floods do not just completely crush tangible properties {{but also those}} intangible things, (economic, psychological, social, and cultural), and more specifically they cause great impacts on the communities lives. In connection with that, this article will analyze comprehensively and intensively the community understanding about <b>the</b> <b>disasters,</b> <b>the</b> local strategies, and the community response to <b>the</b> <b>disaster</b> susceptibilities as <b>the</b> main component in <b>the</b> <b>disaster</b> management plan, which the Sinjai communities still have. This research used the ethnographic approach with the data collection techniques of observation, in depth interviews, and focused discussion. Then the data were analyzed descriptively and analytically. The research results revealed that the communities in Sinjai still preferred to use their local knowledge when treating the environment and avoiding <b>the</b> <b>disasters.</b> <b>The</b> interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>disasters</b> {{was done by the}} communities in two parts, namely the cause and <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>disasters.</b> With <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> this research, it was hoped that we could create a new strategy for the local policy managementand to design a plan for the local-knowledge-based policy in order to mitigate the vulnerability and <b>the</b> <b>disaster</b> management in handling and tackling <b>the</b> <b>disasters...</b>|$|R
