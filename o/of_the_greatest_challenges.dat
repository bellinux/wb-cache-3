5|$|Lemur {{taxonomy}} {{has changed}} significantly {{since the first}} taxonomic classification of lemurs by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>challenges</b> has been the classification of the aye-aye, {{which has been a}} topic of debate up until very recently. Until Richard Owen published a definitive anatomical study in 1866, early naturalists were uncertain whether the aye-aye (genus Daubentonia) was a primate, rodent, or marsupial. However, the placement of the aye-aye within the order Primates remained problematic until very recently. Based on its anatomy, researchers have found support for classifying the genus Daubentonia as a specialized indriid, a sister group to all strepsirrhines, and as an indeterminate taxon within the order Primates. Molecular tests have now shown Daubentoniidae is basal to all Lemuriformes, and in 2008, Russell Mittermeier, Colin Groves, and others ignored addressing higher-level taxonomy by defining lemurs as monophyletic and containing five living families, including Daubentoniidae.|$|E
5|$|The game took {{approximately}} 21 {{months to}} complete; Rocksteady began development {{with a team}} of 40, which had expanded to around 60 by the game's completion. Combat was considered one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>challenges</b> in developing the game; the system went through three iterations. Rocksteady originally developed the game's combat as a full rhythm action game. It was later set in 2D, which involved colored circles crashing into each other during fights; the final system was based on this 2D model. Combat was designed to be unique for Batman, and was given a simple control scheme to reflect the ease with which Batman can perform the moves. Arkham Asylum was built on Epic Games' Unreal Engine 3. Eidos president Ian Livingstone said one developer spent two years programming Batman's cape, using over 700 animations and sound effects to make it move realistically.|$|E

25|$|The anti-literacy laws after 1832 contributed {{greatly to}} the problem of {{widespread}} illiteracy facing the freedmen and other African Americans after Emancipation and the Civil War 35 years later.

25|$|The {{development}} team sought {{input from}} fans on various scenarios {{by means of}} an online survey and brought in trilogy co-creator, co-writer and co-producer Bob Gale as story consultant. Several concepts he and director Robert Zemeckis had originally conceived for Part II, such as the exploration of the Prohibition era and Doc's family history, were reworked into the game. Telltale Games found adhering to the films' established timelines to be one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>challenges</b> regarding the development of the script. Many ideas had to be scrapped due to conflicts that would have caused paradoxes with the stories of the films. Gale stated that although the game {{is not part of the}} series canon, it is possible that it could take place in alternate timelines.|$|E
25|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>challenges</b> {{to mankind}} {{always has been}} eradicating the {{presence}} of debilitating disease. Until just thirty years ago poliomyelitis occurred in the United States and throughout the world in epidemic proportions, striking tens of thousands and killing thousands {{in our own country}} each year. Dr. Jonas E. Salk changed all that. This year we observe the 30th anniversary of the licensing and manufacturing of the vaccine discovered by this great American. Even before another successful vaccine was discovered, Dr. Salk's discovery had reduced polio and its effects by 97 percent. Today, polio is not a familiar disease to younger Americans, and many have difficulty appreciating the magnitude of the disorder that the Salk vaccine virtually wiped {{from the face of the}} Earth.|$|E

25|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>challenges</b> is {{controlling}} or removing quantum decoherence. This {{usually means}} isolating the system from its environment as {{interactions with the}} external world cause the system to decohere. However, other sources of decoherence also exist. Examples include the quantum gates, and the lattice vibrations and background thermonuclear spin of the physical system used to implement the qubits. Decoherence is irreversible, as it is effectively non-unitary, and is usually {{something that should be}} highly controlled, if not avoided. Decoherence times for candidate systems, in particular the transverse relaxation time T2 (for NMR and MRI technology, also called the dephasing time), typically range between nanoseconds and seconds at low temperature. Currently, some quantum computers require their qubits to be cooled to 20 millikelvins in order to prevent significant decoherence.|$|E
25|$|The {{physical}} development processes {{along the coast}} are influenced by a multitude of factors, comprising wave motions, micro and macro-tidal cycles and long shore currents typical to the coastal tract. The shore currents vary greatly along with the monsoon. These are also affected by cyclonic action. Erosion and accretion through these forces maintains varying levels, as yet not properly measured, of physiographic change whilst the mangrove vegetation itself provides a remarkable stability to the entire system. During each monsoon season almost all the Bengal Delta is submerged, much of it for half a year. The sediment of the lower delta plain is primarily advected inland by monsoonal coastal setup and cyclonic events. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>challenges</b> people living on the Ganges Delta may face in coming years is the threat of rising sea levels caused mostly by subsidence {{in the region and}} partly by climate change.|$|E
25|$|The salvage of the Abu Simbel temples {{began in}} 1964 by a {{multinational}} team of archeologists, engineers and skilled heavy equipment operators working {{together under the}} UNESCO banner; it cost some USD $40 million at the time (equal to $300 million in 2017 dollars). Between 1964 and 1968, the entire site was carefully cut into large blocks (up to 30 tons, averaging 20 tons), dismantled, lifted and reassembled in a new location 65 meters higher and 200 meters back from the river, in one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>challenges</b> of archaeological engineering in history. Some structures were even saved from under the waters of Lake Nasser. Today, a few hundred tourists visit the temples daily.

500|$|Asmussen {{said that}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>challenges</b> in {{developing}} God of War III for the PlayStation 3 was the [...] "complexity of everything"; individual tasks, such as designing Helios' decapitation, could take a year because the [...] "level of detail [...] expected [...] so high and intricate, it [...] multiple departments." [...] He said that the PlayStation 3's hardware capabilities allowed more flexibility in character creation and interaction with the environment. The character model for Kratos in the PlayStation 2 (PS2) games used about 5,000 polygons; the PS3 model was about 20,000 – a high number, but less than that used by other models such as Nathan Drake in , who used 35,000. Ken Feldman, the art director, commented that the polygon count {{was not the only}} factor, and cited the increased texture detail as {{one of the reasons for}} Kratos's realistic appearance. The developers used a new technique called blended normal mapping to add realism to the basic model and hugely enhance the range of animation available (e.g., muscle movement, including visible veins, and facial animations). All of the main protagonists were animated by hand because the animators produced more effective work than basic motion capture, though the voice actors' facial movements were recorded by Image Metrics's performance capture system. For animating things like hair, the animators created a secondary animation code, known as Dynamic Simulation, which allows the PS3 itself to mathematically calculate the way it should look; it accurately generates motion that previously took the animators long hours to replicate.|$|E
500|$|Finding {{accommodation}} was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>challenges</b> {{faced by}} black travelers. Not only did many hotels, motels, and boarding houses refuse to serve black customers, {{but thousands of}} towns across the United States declared themselves [...] "sundown towns," [...] which all non-whites had to leave by sunset. Huge numbers of towns across the country were effectively off-limits to African Americans. By {{the end of the}} 1960s, there were at least 10,000 sundown towns across the U.S.– including large suburbs such as Glendale, California (population 60,000 at the time); Levittown, New York (80,000); and Warren, Michigan (180,000). Over half the incorporated communities in Illinois were sundown towns. The unofficial slogan of Anna, Illinois, which had violently expelled its African-American population in 1909, was [...] "Ain't No Niggers Allowed". Even in towns which did not exclude overnight stays by blacks, accommodations were often very limited. African Americans migrating to California to find work in the early 1940s often found themselves camping by the roadside overnight for lack of any hotel accommodation along the way. They were acutely aware of the discriminatory treatment that they received. Courtland Milloy's mother, who took him and his brother on road trips when they were children, recalled that [...] "after riding all day, I'd say to myself, 'Wouldn't it be nice if we could spend the night in one of those hotels?' or, 'Wouldn't it be great if we could stop for a real meal and a cup of coffee?' We'd see the little white children jumping into motel swimming pools, and you all would be {{in the back seat of}} a hot car, sweating and fighting." ...|$|E

500|$|God of War III {{was first}} {{mentioned}} by Cory Barlog at a God of War II launch event, {{and it was}} officially announced at the 2008 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3). After {{the first eight months}} of development, Barlog left Santa Monica for unexplained reasons and Stig Asmussen (lead environment artist and art director on God of War and God of War II, respectively) became director. Asmussen said that one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>challenges</b> in developing God of War III for the PlayStation 3 was the [...] "complexity of everything"; individual tasks, such as designing Helios' decapitation, could take a year because the [...] "level of detail [...] expected [...] so high and intricate, it [...] multiple departments." [...] He said that the PlayStation 3's hardware capabilities allowed more flexibility in character creation and interaction with the environment. The engine for God of War III was ported from the first two installments to the PlayStation 3. As the game was being developed, the code department swapped out PlayStation 2 components with PlayStation 3 components. They replaced the renderer, the particle system, and the collision system. Although they were re-using the engine from God of War II, the core engine for God of War III was brand new. Between E3 2009 and the time the game shipped, morphological anti-aliasing (MLAA) was added, which graphics engineer Ben Diamand said [...] "improved edges dramatically and saved substantial amounts of frame-rate."
