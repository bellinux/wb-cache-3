40|$|Predictions of the {{magnitude}} and timing of Cycle 24 are used {{by a variety of}} Space Weather groups. It is necessary to have quantitative estimates of the uncertainty of the predictions—in both magnitude and timing. These predictions will help estimate orbital drag and other consequences of Space Weather in solar cycle 24. The 45 predictions in Table 1 are a combination of personal work, predictions from the refereed literature, and predictions submitted for the Solar Cycle 24 Prediction Panel. The call for predic-tions was published in several newsletters, including the August, 15, 2006 Solar News. The table is organized by the predicted sunpsot maximum and includes the author (listed in the reference list), date, predicted maximum sunspot number (value and date), category of prediction, and a short summary of method. Although F 10. 7 is used in the atmospheric drag calculations the value of Rz was requested. The prediction categories were Fun, Precursor, Spectral, Climatology, Recent climatology, Neu-ral network, physics-Based, or <b>other</b> (<b>please</b> <b>specify).</b> The fifth column contains a one-letter abbre-viation of the category for each prediction. If the prediction was found during the literature search the category was assigned by the author. Janssens (2005; 2006) has 11 predictions and was a good check on the coverage of the literature.

How was this publication fee covered? (Choose more than one answer if applicable) 	My research funding includes money for paying such fees 	I used part of my research funding not specifically intended for paying such fees 	My institution paid the fees 	I paid the costs myself 	<b>Other</b> (<b>please</b> <b>specify)</b> [Text box follows] * 10. How easy is it to obtain funding if needed for Open Access publishing from your institution or the organisation mainly responsible for financing your research?

Please indicate how strongly you agree/disagree with each statement. [Each statement may be rated “Strongly agree”, “Agree”, “Neither agree nor disagree”, “Disagree” or “Strongly disagree”. The statements are presented in random order. ] 	Researchers should retain the rights to their published work and allow it to be used by others 	Open Access publishing undermines the system of peer review 	Open Access publishing leads to an increase in the publication of poor quality research 	If authors pay publication fees to make their articles Open Access, there will be less money available for research 	It is not beneficial for the general public to have access to published scientific and medical articles 	Open Access unfairly penalises research-intensive institutions with large publication output by making them pay high costs for publication 	Publicly-funded research should be made available to be read and used without access barrier 	Open Access publishing is more cost-effective than subscription-based publishing and so will benefit public investment in research 	Articles that are available by Open Access are likely to be read and cited more often than those not Open Access This study and its questionnaire are based on the SOAP Project ([URL] An article describing the highlights of the SOAP Survey is available at: [URL] The dataset of the SOAP survey is available at [URL] A manual describing the SOAP dataset is available at [URL]...|$|E
