5|$|Christian {{meditation}} performed {{along with}} Eucharistic adoration outside of Mass {{has been associated}} with a large amount of Catholic writings and inspirations specially since the 18th century.

5|$|It is disputed {{whether the}} regular use {{of wine in}} the celebration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist</b> and in daily life were the {{virtually}} universal and undisputed practice in Christianity for over 1,800 years.|$|E
5|$|The liturgy of {{the sacrament}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist,</b> called the Mass in the West and Divine Liturgy or other {{names in the}} East, is the {{principal}} liturgy of the Catholic Church. This is because it is considered the propitiatory sacrifice of Christ himself. The most widely used is the Roman Rite, usually in its ordinary form promulgated by Paul VI in 1969, but also in its authorised extraordinary form, the Tridentine Mass as in the 1962 edition of the Roman Missal. Eastern Catholic Churches have their own rites. The liturgies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist</b> and the other sacraments vary from rite to rite based on differing theological emphasis.|$|E
25|$|Medieval theologians, newly {{exposed to}} Aristotle's philosophy, applied hylomorphism to Christian doctrines such as <b>the</b> transubstantiation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist's</b> {{bread and wine}} into the body and blood of Jesus.

5|$|From the {{beginning}} of Christianity through the tenth century, Christian theologians saw the Eucharist as the church's participation in Christ's sacrifice. Christ {{was believed to be}} present in the Eucharist, but there were differences over the way in which this occurred. The School of Antioch in the Eastern Roman Empire, along with Hilary of Poitiers and Ambrose in the Western Roman Empire, taught a realist, metabolic, or somatic view, where the elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist</b> were believed to be changed into Christ's body and blood. The influential fourth-century Western theologian Augustine of Hippo, on the other hand, held that Christ is really present in the elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist,</b> but not in a bodily manner, because his body remains in heaven. Augustine believed the Eucharist is a spiritual eating which allows Christians to become part of Christ's body. Western theologians in the three centuries following Augustine did not elaborate on the way Christ is present in the Eucharist, but emphasized the transforming power of the sacrament.|$|E
5|$|He {{developed}} the symbolic view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist.</b> He denied the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation and following Cornelius Henrici Hoen, he {{agreed that the}} bread and wine of the institution signify and do not literally become the body and blood of Jesus Christ. Zwingli's differences of opinion on this with Martin Luther resulted in {{the failure of the}} Marburg Colloquy to bring unity between the two Protestant leaders.|$|E

5|$|On {{arriving}} in Oxford, Vermigli began lecturing on 1 Corinthians, denouncing Catholic doctrines of purgatory, clerical celibacy, and lenten fasting. He then spoke against the Catholic doctrine <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist,</b> {{the most sensitive}} area of disagreement between Protestants and Catholics in England at the time. Conservative faculty, led by Smyth, challenged Vermigli to defend his views in a formal disputation. Smyth fled to St Andrews and finally to Leuven before the disputation could be held, so three Catholic divines, William Tresham, William Chedsey and Morgan Phillips, stepped forward to take his place. The disputation was held in 1549 before Richard Cox, the University Chancellor and a firm Protestant. It focused on the doctrine of transubstantiation, with Vermigli's opponents arguing for it and him against. Chancellor Cox made it obvious that he considered Vermigli to have the better argument, but did not formally declare a winner. The disputation put Vermigli {{at the forefront of}} debates over the nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist.</b>|$|E

25|$|In <b>the</b> {{earliest}} days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Church, <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist</b> {{appears to have}} been celebrated on portable altars set up for the purpose.

5|$|Bucer's {{efforts to}} reform the church in Wissembourg {{resulted}} in his excommunication from the Roman Catholic Church, and {{he was forced to}} flee to Strasbourg. There he joined a team of reformers which included Matthew Zell, Wolfgang Capito, and Caspar Hedio. He acted as a mediator between the two leading reformers, Martin Luther and Huldrych Zwingli, who differed on the doctrine <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eucharist.</b> Later, Bucer sought agreement on common articles of faith such as the Tetrapolitan Confession and the Wittenberg Concord, working closely with Philipp Melanchthon on the latter.|$|E
5|$|During late 1536, Farel {{drafted a}} {{confession}} of faith, and Calvin wrote separate articles on reorganizing {{the church in}} Geneva. On 16 January 1537, Farel and Calvin presented their Articles concernant l'organisation de l'église et du culte à Genève (Articles on the Organization of the Church and its Worship at Geneva) to the city council. The document described the manner and frequency of their celebrations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist,</b> the reason for, and the method of, excommunication, the requirement {{to subscribe to the}} confession of faith, the use of congregational singing in the liturgy, and the revision of marriage laws. The council accepted the document on the same day.|$|E

50|$|During <b>the</b> Oxford Movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 19th century, Tractarians {{advanced}} {{a belief}} in the real objective presence <b>of</b> Christ in <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist,</b> but maintained that <b>the</b> details <b>of</b> how He is present remain mystery of faith, a view also held by the Orthodox Church and Methodist Church. Indeed, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oldest Anglo-Catholic devotional societies, <b>the</b> Confraternity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Blessed Sacrament, was founded largely to promote belief in the real objective presence <b>of</b> Christ in <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist.</b>|$|R
50|$|Calvin {{believed}} {{in a real}} spiritual presence <b>of</b> Christ at <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist.</b> For Calvin, union with Christ was at <b>the</b> heart <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lord's Supper.|$|R
5|$|Early Reformed theologians such as John Calvin and Huldrych Zwingli {{rejected}} the medieval belief in transubstantiation, that {{the bread and}} wine <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist</b> change into Christ's body and blood, but taught that Christ's person, including his body and blood, are presented to Christians who partake of it in faith. They also disagree with Martin Luther and the Lutheran tradition which taught that Christ's body is physically eaten with the mouth in the sacrament. Later Reformed orthodox theologians continued to teach views {{similar to that of}} Calvin and Zwingli. In the modern period, Karl Barth espoused a symbolic view that the sacrament only communicates God's promises rather than functioning to actually confer these promises. Other Reformed theologians continued to teach the traditional view.|$|E
5|$|Electric {{lighting}} {{was installed}} in 1938 and an outer door for the north porch added in 1962. Major renovations were carried out from 1981 to 1983; these comprised repairs to the north aisle roof and the east tower, plastering and limewashing of the chancel, replacement of the old electrical and heating systems, and minor work on the organ. The most recent round of restoration was the 2000 reflooring of the nave, installation of a vestry, toilet and kitchen, a new heating system with a detached boiler house, and reglazing of the north porch. Because of the remoteness of the altar from the congregation, a second altar was erected between the parclose screens (extensions forward from {{the ends of the}} rood screen) to enable a more intimate celebration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist.</b> St Nicholas was designated as a Grade I listed building in 1959, which recognizes it as a building of exceptional interest.|$|E
5|$|The {{absence of}} any {{reference}} to a Davidic son-ship in the gospel text suggests that Jesus has been elected to be the end-time prophet, the Chosen One, sent to abolish the Jewish sacrifices. The Prophet-Christology of the gospel text quoted by Epiphanius is more {{at home with the}} Clementine literature than the Christology of the Ebionites known to Irenaeus. According to scholars Richard Bauckham and Petri Luomanen, Jesus is understood in this gospel as having come to abolish the sacrifices rather than substituting for them; thus it is unlikely that it contained the same institution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist</b> as practiced by Nicene orthodox Christianity. However, scholars have yet to reach a consensus over the sacrificial significance of Jesus' mission as depicted in the Ebionite gospel.|$|E

50|$|Christians {{generally}} {{recognize a}} special presence <b>of</b> Christ in <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist,</b> although they differ about exactly how, where, and when Christ is present.

5|$|Vermigli {{was summoned}} to a Chapter Extraordinary of the Lateran Congregation, and his friends warned {{him that he had}} {{powerful}} adversaries. These increasingly foreboding events contributed to his decision to ignore the summons and flee, but he was finally persuaded by his conscience against the Masses he was bound to perform. Vermigli fled Lucca for Pisa on 12 August 1542 by horse with three of his canons. There he celebrated a Protestant form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist</b> for the first time. When he stopped in Florence, staying in Badia Fiesolana where he had entered religious life, Vermigli learned that Bernardino Ochino had arrived there. Vermigli convinced Ochino, a popular preacher with Protestant leanings, to flee Italy as well. On 25 August Vermigli left for Zürich by way of Ferrara and Verona.|$|E
5|$|Vermigli {{was widely}} {{respected}} and very cautious. He {{was able to}} continue his reform efforts in Lucca without any suspicion of unorthodox views, despite a papal meeting there with Emperor Charles V in 1541. His eventual downfall was caused by two of his followers, one of whom openly questioned papal authority and another who celebrated a Protestant form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Eucharist.</b> The reconstitution of the Roman Inquisition in 1542 {{may have been in}} part a response to fear that Lucca and other cities would defect from the Catholic Church. The authorities of the Republic of Lucca began to fear that their political independence from the Holy Roman Empire was at stake if their city continued to be viewed as a Protestant haven. Bans on Protestant books heretofore ignored were enforced, religious feasts which had been dropped were reinstated, and religious processions were scheduled to assure Rome of Lucca's loyalty.|$|E
5|$|Calvin's {{authority}} was practically uncontested during his final years, and he enjoyed an international {{reputation as a}} reformer distinct from Martin Luther. Initially, Luther and Calvin had mutual respect for each other. A doctrinal conflict had developed between Luther and Zurich reformer Huldrych Zwingli on the interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eucharist.</b> Calvin's opinion on the issue forced Luther to place him in Zwingli's camp. Calvin actively participated in the polemics that were exchanged between the Lutheran and Reformed branches of the Reformation movement. At the same time, Calvin was dismayed {{by the lack of}} unity among the reformers. He took steps toward rapprochement with Bullinger by signing the Consensus Tigurinus, a concordat between the Zurich and Geneva churches. He reached out to England when Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer called for an ecumenical synod of all the evangelical churches. Calvin praised the idea, but ultimately Cranmer was unable to bring it to fruition.|$|E
