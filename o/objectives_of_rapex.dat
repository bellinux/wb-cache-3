40|$|Background The {{implementation}} of the Australian Consumer Law in 2011 highlighted the need for better use of injury data to improve the effectiveness and responsiveness of product safety (PS) initiatives. In the PS system, resources are allocated to different priority issues using risk assessment tools. The rapid exchange <b>of</b> information (<b>RAPEX)</b> tool to prioritise hazards, developed by the European Commission, is currently being adopted in Australia. Injury data is required as a basic input to the RAPEX tool in the risk assessment process. One of the challenges in utilising injury data in the PS system is the complexity of translating detailed clinical coded data into broad categories such as those used in the RAPEX tool. Aims This study aims to translate hospital burns data into a simplified format by mapping the International Statistical Classification of Disease and Related Health Problems (Tenth Revision) Australian Modification (ICD- 10 -AM) burn codes into RAPEX severity rankings, using these rankings to identify priority areas in childhood product-related burns data. Methods ICD- 10 -AM burn codes were mapped into four levels of severity using the RAPEX guide table by assigning rankings from 1 - 4, in order <b>of</b> increasing severity. <b>RAPEX</b> rankings were determined by the thickness and surface area of the burn (BSA) with information extracted from the fourth character of T 20 -T 30 codes for burn thickness, and {{the fourth and fifth}} characters of T 31 codes for the BSA. Following the mapping process, secondary data analysis of 2008 - 2010 Queensland Hospital Admitted Patient Data Collection (QHAPDC) paediatric data was conducted to identify priority areas in product-related burns. Results The application <b>of</b> <b>RAPEX</b> rankings in QHAPDC burn data showed approximately 70...|$|R

Currently, accounting is considered to be a measurement discipline with complete measurement objectives, even in the absence of a measurement theory that incorporates the <b>objectives</b> <b>of</b> the measurement process. In this study the principles of the representational theory of measurement (a theory that establishes measurement in the social sciences) are used to emphasise that the <b>objectives</b> <b>of</b> the financial statements are not measurement objectives unless they are supported by a theory of measurement. Hence the financial statements cannot contain measurement information until a theory of measurement is established that incorporates the <b>objectives</b> <b>of</b> the accounting measurement processes.
