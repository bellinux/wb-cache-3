40|$|Regional {{development}} {{takes place}} in a complex force field, in which competitiveness is playing an increasingly important role. At present, we observe a repositioning of regions in an <b>open</b> <b>European</b> <b>space.</b> Vanishing borders will automatically mean an increase of competition between European regions. The driving forces behind such competition are strongly related with the presence of R & D centres and network links with other regions. The paper addresses the fundamentals of modern regional policy and calls in particular for due attention for the critical role of infrastructure networks in the European unification process. The changing role of governments in this context is also highlighted. The paper focuses on particular in Central and Eastern European regions and discusses in detail the opportunities offered by foreign direct investments. ...|$|E

40|$|In urban public outdoor space, the {{possibility}} to define multi-functional islands, to create "fusion" of socialization, leisure and work spaces ‒ for example lounges with wireless connectivity, quiet corners to {{work as well as}} areas for socializing and relax … ‒ reduces isolation and increases innovation opportunities. The development of electronic live/work areas and villages is becoming an attractive option for the rehabilitation of open space in historic and postindustrial cities. There are multiple application fields: pedestrian spaces, streets and meeting points, "relaxation" places, commercial spaces, multifunctions spaces, structures for temporary demonstrations or for urban art. The importance of public space is highlighted in providing support that can facilitate the different types of social interaction with new media technologies, to overcome the digital divide in deprived neighborhoods.
