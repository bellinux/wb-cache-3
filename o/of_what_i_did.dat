25|$|Much <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> with {{my weight}} was very natural, vocally. Now I've got a {{different}} body—there's {{not as much}} of me around. My diaphragm function, the way my throat feels, is not compromised in any way. But I do {{have to think about}} it more now. I have to remind myself to keep my ribs open. I have to remind myself, if my breath starts to stack. When I took a breath before, the weight would kick in and give it that extra Whhoomf! Now it doesn't do that. If I don't remember to get rid of the old air and re-engage the muscles, the breath starts stacking, and that's when you can't get your phrase, you crack high notes.|$|E
25|$|I {{am proud}} <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{and would do}} it again. Jasenovac was a legal {{institution}} based on law, where all those proved to have worked {{for the destruction of}} the Croatian state, and who had been dangerous for public order and safety, were interned. Considering the duration and population of the camp, the death rate was natural and normal. If we shot people, we did it {{on the basis of the}} law. There are no states in the world that don't have prisons and camps, and somebody has to perform this thankless duty. I regret that we hadn't done all that is imputed to us, for, had we done that then, today Croatia would not have had problems. There wouldn't have been people to write these lies.|$|E

60|$|And there I paused. The thought <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{and what}} the {{consequences}} must be rushed suddenly upon me. I shivered as a man shivers in awaking. I dropped on my knees before her, bowing my head and flinging wide my arms.|$|E

6000|$|And therewith Viola, perhaps perceiving {{what she}} had betrayed, turned more crimson than ever, and hid her face against me with a sob in her breath, and then I was quite sure <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not dare to express, further than by saying, while I caressed her, [...] "I believe they {{honestly}} think {{it is all the}} same." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "After all, perfect candor is {{a little}} painful now and then; but let me go on. At least, I brought you into an {{environment}} with which you were not content.

Then I entered into a serious discourse with the Spaniard whom I called governor, about their stay in the island; for as I was not come to carry any of them off, so it would not be just to carry off some and leave others, who perhaps would be unwilling to stay if their strength was diminished.|$|E

6000|$|... "No, sir," [...] Ned said decidedly; [...] "I can't {{recollect}} {{anything of}} that at all. I am quite sure if I had done that I should remember it; for I seem to remember, now I think of it, a good deal <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> Yes, I went up through Varley; the lights weren't out, and I wondered what Bill would say if I were to knock at his door and he opened it and saw what a state my face was in. Then I {{went out on the}} moor, {{and it seems to me}} that I walked about for hours, and the longer I walked the more angry I was. At last--it could not have been long before morning, I think--I lay down for a time, and then when it was light I made up my mind to go over and see Abijah. I knew she would be with me.

[...] "Hah," [...] said Lynette, [...] "meseemeth you speak very saucily for a kitchen knave." [...] And Sir Gareth said, still speaking very calmly, [...] "Think you so, Lady?" [...] And Lynette said, [...] "Yea," [...] and she said, [...] "I see that thou still ever forgettest my commands, for thou art riding so nigh to me that methinks I smell the kitchen. Now I prythee draw a little farther away." [...] And Sir Gareth said, [...] "Damsel, it shall be as you command." [...] And therewith he drew rein so as to ride at a little greater distance, and Lynette laughed to see him do so.|$|E
60|$|In {{this last}} charge I {{received}} a rude blow from a stout fellow on foot with the butt {{end of his}} musket which perfectly stunned me, and fetched me off from my horse; and had not some near me took care of me, I had been trod to death by our own men. But the fellow being immediately killed, and my friends finding me alive, had taken me up, and carried me off some distance, where I came to myself again after some time, but knew little <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> or said that night. This was the reason why I say I afterwards understood the enemy retreated; for I saw no more what they did then, nor indeed was I well of this blow for {{all the rest of}} the summer, but had frequent pains in my head, dizzinesses and swimming, that gave me some fears the blow had injured the skull; but it wore off again, nor did it at all hinder my attending my charge.|$|E

Yes," [...] she added drearily, [...] "it was foolish and wicked, and it was perfectly useless, too.

I drove them on to risk their lives because I thought myself {{so much better than}} they; because I was self-righteous and suspicious and stubborn. Well, I must bear the penalty: and oh, if I could only bear it alone!" [...] With a long sigh she took back the burden which she had been struggling to cast off, and from which for a time she had actually seemed to escape. She put away her hat and shawl, and stood before the glass, smoothing her hair. [...] "When will it ever end?" [...] she moaned to the reflection there, rather than to her mother, who did not interrupt this spiritual ordeal. In another age, such a New England girl would have tortured herself with inquisition as to some neglected duty to God;--in ours, when religion is so largely humanified, this Puritan soul could only wreak itself in a sense of irreparable wrong to her fellow-creature.|$|E

On the other hand, I told them I came to establish them there, not to remove them; and then I let them know that I had brought with me relief of sundry kinds for them; that I had been at a great charge to supply them with all things necessary, as well for their convenience as their defence; and that I had such and such particular persons with me, as well to increase and recruit their number, as by the particular necessary employments which they were bred to, being artificers, to assist them in those things in which at present they were in want.|$|E
6000|$|She {{came into}} the Cove (as {{that part of the}} harbour is called), of course very slowly, and at some hundred feet or so short of the quay she lost her way. That quay was then a wooden one, a fine {{structure}} of mighty piles and stringers bearing a roadway--a thing of great strength. The ship, as I have said before, stopped moving when some hundred feet from it. Then her engines were rung on slow ahead, and immediately rung off again. The propeller made just about five turns, I should say. She began to move, stealing on, so to speak, without a ripple; coming alongside with the utmost gentleness. I went on looking her over, very much interested, but the man with me, the pilot, muttered under his breath: [...] "Too much, too much." [...] His exercised judgment had warned him <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not even suspect. But I believe that neither of us was exactly prepared for what happened. There was a faint concussion of the ground under our feet, a groaning of piles, a snapping of great iron bolts, and with a sound of ripping and splintering, as when a tree is blown down by the wind, a great strong piece of wood, a baulk of squared timber, was displaced several feet as if by enchantment. I looked at my companion in amazement. [...] "I could not have believed it," [...] I declared. [...] "No," [...] he said. [...] "You would not have thought she would have cracked an egg--eh?" ...|$|E
