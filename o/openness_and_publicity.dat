Of the details of the question he knew, of his own knowledge, absolutely nothing; but he had consented to occupy the chair on that occasion {{at the request of the}} London Association of Correctors of the Press for two reasons-- first, because he thought that <b>openness</b> <b>and</b> <b>publicity</b> in such cases were a very wholesome example very much needed at this time, and were highly becoming to a body of men associated with that great public safeguard--the Press; secondly, because he knew from some slight practical experience, what the duties of correctors of the press were, and how their duties were usually discharged; and he could testify, and did testify, that they were not mechanical, that they were not mere matters of manipulation and routine; but that they required from those who performed them much natural intelligence, much super-added cultivation, readiness of reference, quickness of resource, an excellent memory, and a clear understanding. He most gratefully acknowledged that he had never gone through the sheets of any book that he had written, without having presented to him by the correctors of the press something that he had overlooked, some slight inconsistency into which he had fallen, some little lapse he had made--in short, without having set down in black and white some unquestionable indication that he had been closely followed through the work by a patient and trained mind, and not merely by a skilful eye. And in this declaration he had not the slightest doubt that the great body of his brother and sister writers would, as a plain act of justice, readily concur. For these plain reasons he was there; and being there he begged to assure them that every one present--that every speaker--would have a patient hearing, whatever his opinions might be.|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} openness in {{the common}} law tradition and considers how the underlying values of this vital principle should apply to restrictions on access to proceedings and publication bans {{in the era of}} the Charter. It argues that closure of trial proceedings, entirely or in part, should rarely be upheld under the Charter. The Criminal Code provision dealing with closure is unnecessarily broad and can only be applied constitutionally in a narrow range of circumstances. Publication bans also offend the principles of <b>openness</b> <b>and</b> <b>publicity.</b> Mandatory bans should not be found constitutional in the absence of compelling circumstances. Prior restraints cannot be justified as a matter of routine, and the government should be required to articulate compelling reasons in every case. Likewise, where identities are shielded from disclosure, the government must be required to give compelling reasons why the public cannot know the names of participants in the criminal justice process...|$|E
40|$|Scientific {{research}} is a conscious and systematic approach to acquire knowledge, based on theories, methods and standards {{that have been}} developed through the history of scientific disciplines. The terms “research integrity” and “good research practice” refer to ideals for how research ought to be performed. In the 1940 s the American sociologist Robert Merton proposed norms for scientific research that have influenced the discussion on research integrity since then. According to Merton good research should not be secret or anyone’s property but requires instead <b>openness</b> <b>and</b> <b>publicity.</b> Merton uses the term communism/communalism for this norm. The second norm, according to Merton, is universalism, which means that the only relevant criteria for assessing research are the scientific criteria. The position or characteristic of the researcher has no relevance. Thirdly, disinterestedness means that the main motive driving the researcher should be the quest for knowledge, not for example economic gain or fame. Finally, the researcher should always be open for questioning the result. Merton calls this “organized scepticism”. This norm coheres with Karl Popper’s famous demarcation line between research and other activities; falsification, i. e. the constant efforts to falsify one’s result in order to get closer to the truth. Merton’s norms for research are summarized in the acronym CUDOS. Although the exact meaning and implication of Merton’s criteria can be discussed, they imply an ideal for scientific work and deviations from this ideal can be seen as misconduct in research. Merton’s CUDOS norms are well - known examples of ideals and norms for science. These norms could be seen as the basis for professional ethics of researchers. Scientific misconduct and fraud are deviation from the ideals of science and good research practice. In the following we first conceptualise the area of scientific misconduct. Then we present some norms, guidelines and codes of scientific integrity. In the next section we argue that scientific misconduct is a real problem that must be taken seriously by the research community and finally we discuss how scientific misconduct is investigated, how common it is and how it can be explained.   Annex 1. b Ethical Assessment of Research and Innovation: A Comparative Analysis of Practices and Institutions in the EU and selected other countries Deliverable 1. 1.

The contributors - sociologists, political scientists, historians, legal scholars - consider the micro-technology of voting (the devil is in the detail), the historical relations between the secret ballot and universal suffrage, the use and abolition of secret voting in parliamentary decisions, and the sometimes perverse effects of the drive for greater <b>openness</b> <b>and</b> transparency in public affairs. The authors also discuss the normative questions of secret versus public voting in national elections and of optimal mixes of secrecy <b>and</b> <b>publicity,</b> as well as the opportunities for strategic behavior created by different voting systems.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} use of {{government}} social media for <b>openness</b> <b>and</b> accountability. The extant literature has highlighted the benefits of social media use in this context to enhance citizen participation and engagement in decision-making and policy development, facilitate <b>openness</b> <b>and</b> transparency efforts, and reduce corruption. Yet, there are limited studies that discuss those properties of social media that can afford <b>openness</b> <b>and</b> accountability, and their implications for policy and practise. To address these gaps, a study is conducted in the Greek context using interviews with top managers, policy makers, and relevant stakeholders across five initiatives. We discuss distinct affordances for <b>openness</b> <b>and</b> accountability, and propose their inclusion as building blocks of the national ICT policy for <b>openness</b> <b>and</b> accountability.

Analyses were conducted on the four waves of the European Social Survey, including large representative samples in up to 26 European countries (total N > 175, 000).

40|$|Abstract: The {{link between}} trade <b>openness</b> <b>and</b> {{environmental}} quality {{has become one}} of the most debated topics in recent years. Yet, limited empirical investigations have been carried out in this area. This paper examines the relationship between trade <b>openness</b> <b>and</b> carbon emissions in the case of Sri Lanka. The Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach and the Johansen-Juselius maximum likelihood approach are employed to detect cointegration relationships over the period 1960 to 2006. The results suggest neither a long run equilibrium relationship nor a long term causality exists between trade <b>openness</b> <b>and</b> carbon emissions for Sri Lanka. However, there exists a short run relationship between trade <b>openness</b> <b>and</b> carbon emissions. Griffith Business School, Department of Accounting, Finance and EconomicsFull Tex...|$|R

Going beyond traditional macroeconomic determinants, we identify the role of both trade- and finance-related factors in explaining RER volatility at different time horizons. The results suggest that RER volatility tends to increase with financial <b>openness</b> <b>and</b> with transport costs but decrease with trade <b>openness</b> <b>and</b> with financial depth. Moreover, the time horizon matters. Financial factors (financial <b>openness</b> <b>and</b> financial depth) are found to influence RER volatility at primarily short horizons, while trade-related factors (trade <b>openness</b> <b>and</b> transport costs) contribute significantly also to RER volatility at much longer horizons. The relative importance of traditional macroeconomic fundamentals and these trade- and finance-related factors can vary considerably across horizons. exchange rate volatility, time horizons, trade openness, financial openness, financial depth...|$|R
40|$|As a {{replication}} {{and expansion}} of work done by Alsdurf (1977), the relations between religiosity, commitment to scholarly <b>openness</b> <b>and</b> reasons for religious change were examined through a survey of 146 students attending a South-central university.

A negative correlation was obtained between scholarly <b>openness</b> <b>and</b> religiosity for the total population studied, but the correlation was weak. In contrast to expectations, a significant negative correlation between scholarly <b>openness</b> <b>and</b> religiosity was not obtained for those who reported never experiencing a significant religious change. Conflicting with Alsdurf’s (1977) findings, a sinfulness factor mediating religious change was positively rather than negatively correlated with scholarly <b>openness,</b> <b>and</b> a factor assessing significant interaction with others was unrelated rather than positively correlated with scholarly openness.

An institutional framework of four levels of social analysis (Williamson, 2000) and theories relating to democratic ideal, governance and the public sphere are used to understand and explain the mechanisms operating when dealing with <b>openness</b> <b>and</b> transparency in political decision making.
