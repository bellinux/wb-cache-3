50|$|One Hundred and <b>One</b> <b>Nights</b> (Kitâb Fîhi Hadîth Mi'at Layla wa Layla) {{is a book}} of Arab {{literature}} {{consisting of}} twenty stories, which presents many similarities to the more famous One Thousand and <b>One</b> <b>Nights.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{themes and}} {{narrative}} structure {{are very similar}} to those of the One Thousand and <b>One</b> <b>Nights</b> — having as setting the immense Muslim world, the stories talk about intrepid travellers, epic and romantic adventures, and enigmas, desires and wonders, which enchant the reader. Besides the other similarities to the One Thousand and <b>One</b> <b>Nights,</b> <b>One</b> Hundred and <b>One</b> <b>Nights</b> has the same heroine — Scheherazade — but it is thought to be older. With the exception of the tales of “The Ebony Horse” and the “Seven Viziers”, also present in “One Thousand and One Nights”, the stories are different in the two works. However, the spirit of both is the same and the scholars consider that the reading of each one of them complements the other and allows a more complete appreciation of mediaeval Arabian literature. According to Claudia Ott, while One Thousand and <b>One</b> <b>Nights</b> talks about the Eastern Arab world, One Hundred and <b>One</b> <b>Nights</b> takes place in the Western Arab world.|$|R
