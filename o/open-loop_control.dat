25|$|The {{control system}} {{performance}} {{can be improved}} by combining the feedback (or closed-loop) control of a PID controller with feed-forward (or <b>open-loop)</b> <b>control.</b> Knowledge about the system (such as the desired acceleration and inertia) can be fed forward and combined with the PID output to improve the overall system performance. The feed-forward value alone can often provide the major portion of the controller output. The PID controller primarily has to compensate whatever difference or error remains between the setpoint (SP) and the system response to the open loop control. Since the feed-forward output is not affected by the process feedback, it can never cause the control system to oscillate, thus improving the system response without affecting stability. Feed forward can {{be based on the}} setpoint and on extra measured disturbances. Setpoint weighting is a simple form of feed forward.|$|E

AIAA 2006 - 6354, Keystone, Colorado, Aug. 21 - 24, 2006 Suppose optimal <b>open-loop</b> <b>controls</b> could be computed in real time. This implies optimal feedback control. These controls are, typically, nonsmooth. Nonsmooth controls raise fundamental theoretical {{problems on the}} existence and uniqueness of feedback solutions. A simple, yet powerful, approach to address these theoretical issues {{is the concept of}} a on fourth- solution that is closely linked to the practical implementation of zero-order-hold control sampling. In other words, even traditional feedback <b>controls</b> involve <b>open-loop</b> <b>controls</b> through the process of sampling. In this paper, we advance the notion of Caratheodory-_ solutions that use the sampling intervals to compute optimal <b>open-loop</b> <b>controls.</b> A sampling theorem is developed which indicates that the Lipschitz constant of the dynamics is a fundamental sampling frequency. This places computation at the level of first principles in describing the foundations for achieving feedback. We obtain these controls by way of Pseudospectral (PS) methods as these techniques can generate optimal <b>open-loop</b> <b>controls</b> within fractions of a second even when implemented in a MATLAB environment running on legacy computer hardware. In order to facilitate an exposition of the proposed ideas to a wide audience, we introduce the core principles only while relegating the intricate details to numerous recent references.

40|$|We {{consider}} a Markovian stochastic control problem with model uncertainty.

The adverse player (nature) {{who does not}} have a direct interest in the pay-off, chooses <b>open-loop</b> <b>controls</b> that parametrize Knightian uncertainty. This creates a two-step optimization problem (like half of a game) over feed-back strategies and <b>open-loop</b> <b>controls.</b> The main result is to show that, under some assumptions, this provides the same value as the (half of) the zero-sum symmetric game where the adverse player also plays feed-back strategies and actively tries to minimize the pay-off.

50|$|Stepper motors {{are often}} used for <b>open-loop</b> <b>control</b> of position. A stepper motor rotates to {{one of a number}} of fixed positions, {{according}} to its internal construction.

Such motors {{are often used}}, together with a simple initial datum sensor (a switch that is activated at the machine's home position), for the control of simple robotic machines or even the commonplace inkjet printer head. The drawback of <b>open-loop</b> <b>control</b> of steppers is that if the machine load is too high, or the motor attempts to move too quickly, then steps may be skipped. The controller has no means of detecting this and so the machine continues to run slightly out of adjustment, until reset.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{addresses}} theoretical {{foundations of}} motion planning with differential constraints {{in the presence}} of obstacles. We establish general conditions for the existence of resolution complete planning algorithms by introducing a functional analysis framework and reducing algorithm existence to a simple topological property. First, we establish metric spaces over the control function space and the trajectory space. Second, using these metrics and assuming that the control system is Lipschitz continuous, we show that the mapping between <b>open-loop</b> <b>controls</b> and corresponding trajectories is continuous. Next, we prove that the set of all paths connecting the initial state to the goal set is open. Therefore, the set of <b>open-loop</b> <b>controls,</b> corresponding to solution trajectories, must be open. This leads to a simple algorithm that searches for a solution by sampling a control space directly, without building a reachability graph. A dense sample set is given by a discrete-time model. Convergence of the algorithm is proven in the metric of a trajectory space. The results provide some insights into the design of more effective planning algorithms and motion primitives. ...|$|R

As for closed-loop control, a passivity-based approach analyzing SMA closed loop stability has been used (Madill and Wen, 1994). Wen et al.'s study provides another example of closed-loop feedback control, demonstrating the stability of closed-loop control in SMA applications through applying a combination of force feedback control and position control on a flexible aluminum beam actuated by an SMA made from Nitinol.|$|E
