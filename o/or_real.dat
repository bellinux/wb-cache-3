During the course of the show, he has fathered litters of puppies, passed obedience school, had surgery for bloat, replaced Duffman as the mascot for Duff Beer, and been trained as a police dog at Springfield's Animal Police Academy. Some of the episodes that focus on Santa's Little Helper have been inspired by popular culture <b>or</b> <b>real</b> experiences that staff members of the show have gone through.|$|E

5|$|The Transitional Federal Government, {{formed in}} 2004, was {{recognized}} as the central government of Somalia. Before December 2006, the TFG controlled only the town of Baidoa, the sixth largest city. The intervention of Ethiopian government forces following {{the rise of the}} Islamic Courts Union, culminating in the latter's defeat in the Battle of Baidoa, allowed the TFG to expand its control under the protection of Ethiopian troops. The TFG was at the time not able to effectively collect taxes, had no notable finances <b>or</b> <b>real</b> power base, and struggled to exert control over Mogadishu following an attempted move in late December 2006. However, the TFG later succeeded in capturing most of Somalia from insurgents, but struggled to cement its control and establish law and order.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War {{was officially}} {{concluded}} with the capitulation of the Empire of Japan, plans for trying the major German and Japanese war criminals were quickly implemented in 1946. While Japanese officials {{had to face}} the Tokyo Trials, major German war crimes were dealt with at the Nuremberg Trials. Here it was the goal of the Allied prosecutors to portray the limited cooperation between the Third Reich and Imperial Japan as a long-planned conspiracy to divide the world among the two Axis-partners and thereby delivering just another demonstration of the common viciousness expressed by alleged joint long-term war plans. According to modern historic research, however, such a conspiracy did not exist and is considered Allied propaganda. Although there was a limited and cautious military cooperation between Japan and Germany during the Second World War, no documents corroborating any long-term planning <b>or</b> <b>real</b> coordination of military operations of both powers exist.|$|E

Mobile Suit Gundam SEED aired between October5,2002, and September27,2003. Each episode was streamed on the Internet {{the day after}} broadcast, for users subscribing to Nippon Telegraph and Telephone services, in Windows Media <b>or</b> <b>Real</b> format. The series was sold in Japan as thirteen DVD volumes released from March28,2003 to March26,2004. On March26,2004, a five-minute epilogue called After Phase: In the Valley of Stars was released on the thirteenth and final DVD of the Japanese release. A DVD box set of the series was released on February23,2010. A fifty-episode sequel titled Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny aired in Japan from October9,2004 to October1,2005, airing on the same stations as Gundam SEED. Gundam SEED Destiny takes place {{two years after the}} original series and follows Shinn Asuka, focusing mainly on his involvement in the new war.|$|E
