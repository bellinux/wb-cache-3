5|$|At {{the start}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Eighteenth</b> Dynasty, only kings were buried within the valley in large tombs. When a non-royal person was buried, {{it was in}} a small rock cut chamber, close to the tomb of their master. Amenhotep III's tomb was {{constructed}} in the Western Valley, and while his son Akhenaten moved his tomb's construction to Amarna, it is thought that the unfinished WV25 may have originally been intended for him. With the return to religious orthodoxy at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Eighteenth</b> Dynasty, Tutankhamun, Ay, and Horemheb returned to the royal necropolis.|$|E

5|$|During {{the last}} part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> century, the number of fossils in British {{collections}} quickly increased. According to an hypothesis published by science historian Robert William Theodor Gunther in 1925, among them was a partial lower jaw of Megalosaurus, acquired in October 1797 by Christopher Pegge for 10s.6d. and added to {{the collection of the}} Anatomy School of Christ Church college.|$|E

5|$|Sensibility in {{the second}} half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> century was {{considered}} both a physical and a moral phenomenon. Physicians and anatomists believed that the more sensitive people's nerves, the more emotionally affected they would be by their surroundings. Since women were thought to have keener nerves than men, it was also believed that women were more emotional than men. The emotional excess associated with sensibility also theoretically produced an ethic of compassion: those with sensibility could easily sympathize with people in pain. Thus historians have credited the discourse of sensibility and those who promoted it with the increased humanitarian efforts, such as the movement to abolish the slave trade, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> century. But sensibility was also thought to paralyze those who had too much of it; they were weakened by constant vicarious suffering.|$|E
5|$|Both of Wollstonecraft's novels also {{critique}} {{the discourse}} of sensibility, a moral philosophy and aesthetic that had become popular at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> century. Mary is itself a novel of sensibility and Wollstonecraft attempts to use the tropes of that genre to undermine sentimentalism itself, a philosophy she believed was damaging to women because it encouraged them to rely overmuch on their emotions. In The Wrongs of Woman the heroine's indulgence on romantic fantasies fostered by novels themselves is depicted as particularly detrimental.|$|E
5|$|Higher {{education}} in the city {{can be traced back}} to the second half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> century, when the ownership of the city was inherited by Field Crown Hetman Jan Klemens Branicki. As a patron of the arts and sciences, Branicki encouraged numerous artists and scientists to settle in Białystok to take advantage of Branicki's patronage. In 1745 Branicki established Poland's first military college, the School of Civil and Military Engineering, in the city.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Jacobite risings, a movement to restore Stuart King James II of England to the throne, the British government enacted a series of laws that attempted to speed the process of the destruction of the clan system. Measures included a ban on the bearing of arms, the wearing of tartan and limitations on the activities of the Episcopalian Church. Most of the legislation was repealed by the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> century as the Jacobite threat subsided.|$|E

In these novels, the Mangalorean Catholic community <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> century are portrayed as brave, hardworking and selfless, while Tipu is portrayed as cunning, haughty, hard-hearted, revengeful, yet full of self-control.|$|E
5|$|Poems {{were also}} written to {{celebrate}} kingship. For example, at the Precinct of Amun-Re at Karnak, Thutmose III (r. 1479–1425 BC) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Eighteenth</b> dynasty erected a stela commemorating his military victories {{in which the}} gods bless Thutmose in poetic verse and ensure for him victories over his enemies. In addition to stone stelas, poems have been found on wooden writing boards used by schoolboys. Besides the glorification of kings, poems were written to honor various deities, and even the Nile.|$|E
500|$|There {{had been}} a {{distillery}} in <b>the</b> Evanton area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kiltearn parish as early as <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> century, its existence being reported by Harry Robertson, <b>the</b> author <b>of</b> <b>the</b> late <b>eighteenth</b> century Kiltearn section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> late <b>eighteenth</b> century 1st Statistical Account. The Glen Skiack distillery opened in 1896 [...] and only ever produced a relatively small amount <b>of</b> Whisky. However, <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Prohibition law, which damaged <b>the</b> income <b>of</b> all Scottish distilleries, proved too much for Glen Skiack, and the operation was forced to close in 1926. The building itself was demolished in 1933.|$|R

5|$|Romanticism was {{a complex}} artistic, {{literary}} and intellectual movement that {{originated in the}} second half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> century in western Europe, and gained strength during and after the Industrial and French Revolutions. It was partly a revolt against the political norms of the Age of Enlightenment which rationalised nature, and was embodied most strongly in the visual arts, music, and literature, but significantly influenced historiography, philosophy and the natural sciences.|$|E
5|$|The Great Depression and the {{election}} of Democratic party candidates in 1932 ended widespread national support for Prohibition. Franklin D. Roosevelt, who included repeal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Eighteenth</b> Amendment as a major issue of his presidential campaign in 1932, made good on his promise to American voters. On December 5, 1933, the Twenty-first Amendment repealed the Eighteenth Amendment and ended nationwide Prohibition. However, Indiana's legislature continued to regulate alcohol within the state through allocation of state liquor licenses and prohibition of sales on Sunday.|$|E
5|$|The Histoire Naturelle was {{translated}} into languages including English, German, Swedish, Russian and Italian. Many translations, often partial (single volumes, or all volumes to a certain date), abridged, reprinted in the same translation by different printers, or with additional text (for example on insects) and new illustrations, were made at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> century {{and the start of}} the nineteenth century, presenting a complicated publication history. Early translations were necessarily only of the earlier volumes. Given the complexity, all catalogue dates other than of single volumes should be taken as approximate.|$|E

5|$|The Whig Monthly Review, {{founded in}} 1749 by Ralph Griffiths, and the Tory Critical Review, founded in 1756 by Tobias Smollett, {{were the first}} {{journals}} dedicated to reviewing books in Britain. Although {{they were joined by}} smaller publications such as the Analytical Review, these two journals dominated reviewing in the second half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> century. They focused on poetry, novels, drama, belles-lettres, travel literature, biographies, science writing and other forms of popular literature. They did not review many complex theological or scholarly works, particularly those in foreign languages.|$|E
5|$|The end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> century saw the {{division}} of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, in three steps, among the neighboring states. The Kingdom of Prussia acquired Białystok and the surrounding region during the third partition. The city became the capital of the New East Prussia province in 1795. Prussia lost the territory following Napoleon Bonaparte's victory in the War of the Fourth Coalition as the resultant 1807 Treaties of Tilsit awarded the area to the Russian Empire, which organized the region into the Belostok Oblast, with the city as the regional center.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} coffin of Thutmose I {{was taken}} over and re-used by a later pharaoh of the 21st dynasty. The mummy of Thutmose I {{was thought to be}} lost, but Egyptologist Gaston Maspero, largely on the strength of familial resemblance to the mummies of Thutmose II and Thutmose III, believed he had found his mummy in the otherwise unlabelled mummy #5283. This identification has been supported by subsequent examinations, revealing that the embalming techniques used came from the appropriate period of time, almost certainly after that of Ahmose I and made during the course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Eighteenth</b> dynasty.|$|E
