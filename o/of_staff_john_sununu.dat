50|$|The Greening of Planet Earth is a half-hour-long video {{produced}} by the coal industry, which argues that rising CO2 levels will be beneficial to agriculture, and that policies intending to reduce CO2 levels are therefore misguided. The video argues that rising CO2 levels both directly stimulate plant growth and, {{as a result of}} their warming properties, cause winter temperatures to rise, thereby indirectly stimulating plant growth. It was produced in 1991 and released the following year. A sequel, entitled, The Greening of Planet Earth Continues, was released in 1998. The video was narrated by Sherwood Idso. After the video was made, it was distributed to thousands of journalists by a coal industry group. The video became very popular viewing in the George H. W.

50|$|Later, he {{was tapped}} again by President Ronald Reagan {{for a similar}} {{position}} from 1982-1984, where he worked as an economic adviser. He famously feuded with Bush White House Chief <b>Of</b> <b>Staff</b> <b>John</b> H. <b>Sununu.</b> He also served as Dean of the College of Business at Arizona State University from 1982 to 1985. In 1985, he became {{the chairman of the}} Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and served until 1991, working extensively during the American savings and loan crisis to restore solvency to the failing savings and loan sector of American banking. He was the first chairman of the related agency, the Resolution Trust Corporation, which was created specifically to address issues arising from the savings and loan crisis, from 1989 until his retirement from active government in 1991 - his ouster from the FDIC Chairman position was orchestrated by the George H.W. Bush Administration, who felt Seidman's full disclosure about Savings and Loan fraud might be damaging to that administration's interests, according to the New York Times. Neil Bush was, at the time, being investigated at Silverado Savings And Loan.|$|R
5000|$|Though Nungesser {{had opposed}} Duke's gubernatorial candidacy, he also quarreled with Duke's intraparty rival, then Governor Buddy Roemer, whom Duke {{prevented}} from obtaining {{a spot in}} the general election against Edwards held on November 16, 1991. Tensions developed between Roemer and Nungesser when Roemer arranged his celebrated party switch from Democrat to Republican through the Bush White House Chief <b>of</b> <b>Staff</b> <b>John</b> H. <b>Sununu,</b> rather than the Louisiana state party headed by Chairman Nungesser. Anti-Duke elements in the Louisiana GOP, including Beth Rickey, a moderate member of the Republican State Central Committee from New Orleans, claimed that Nungesser was too hesitant to attack Duke for his presumed neo-Nazi and Klan ties out of fear that such a posture might discourage pro-Duke voters from blue collar backgrounds from switching to the Republican Party. The presence of a third Republican gubernatorial candidate in 1991, U.S. Representative Clyde C. Holloway of Rapides Parish, known for his firm antiabortion position, further complicated the picture. The result was the Edwards-Duke confrontation which Edwards won easily. Signs on Edwards' behalf even said: [...] "Vote for the Crook. It's Important." ...|$|R
500|$|During the 1988 presidential election, Kennedy {{supported}} the eventual Democratic nominee, Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis, {{from the start}} of the campaign. In the fall, Dukakis lost to George H. W. Bush, but Kennedy won re-election to the Senate over Republican Joseph D. Malone in the easiest race of his career. Kennedy remained a powerful force in the Senate. [...] In 1988 Kennedy co-sponsored an amendment to the Fair Housing Act of 1968, which prohibits discrimination in the rental, sale, marketing, and financing of the nation's housing; the amendment strengthened the ability of the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity to enforce the Act and expanded the protected classes to include disabled persons and families with children. After prolonged negotiations during 1989 with Bush chief <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> <b>John</b> H. <b>Sununu</b> and Attorney General Richard Thornburgh to secure Bush's approval, he directed passage of the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Kennedy had personal interest in the bill due to his sister Rosemary's condition and his son's lost leg, and he considered its enactment one of the most important successes of his career. In the late 1980s Kennedy and Hatch staged a prolonged battle against Senator Jesse Helms to provide funding to combat the AIDS epidemic and provide treatment for low-income people affected; this would culminate in passage of the Ryan White Care Act. In late November 1989, Kennedy traveled to see first-hand the newly fallen Berlin Wall; he spoke at John-F.-Kennedy-Platz, site of the famous [...] "Ich bin ein Berliner" [...] speech in 1963, and said [...] "Emotionally, I just wish my brother could have seen it." ...|$|R
