In his first match of the season against the Marylebone Cricket Club, Halcombe took 3/35 and 2/30, including noted batsman Frank Woolley, but was unable to prevent a seven-wicket defeat.|$|E
5|$|The {{station at}} Chalfont Road was built with almost all {{facilities}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>up</b> side (the London-bound platform). As Chalfont St Giles, the largest nearby settlement, {{was on the}} other side of the tracks, most passengers travelling to and from the station were obliged to take a lengthy detour from the single exit. A footpath across the tracks was added in 1925, but an approach road giving access to the station from the southern side of the railway line was not built until 1933. The station had three platforms; one platform in each direction on the London–Aylesbury line, and a bay platform alongside the up platform for trains to Chesham. A run-around loop was built to allow locomotives reversing in the bay platform always to be at the front of their trains. It was built outside the station, meaning locomotives reversing on the Chesham line were obliged to push their trains out of the station before performing the manoeuvre.|$|E
25|$|Doncaster {{station has}} limited {{facilities}} for terminating branch trains <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>up</b> {{side of the}} station. This has been remedied {{with the opening of}} a new platform (platform 0) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>up</b> side so that trains to and from the Thorne direction are able to de-conflict their arrivals and departures with high-speed trains.|$|E

25|$|Pitches in Zimbabwe closely {{resemble}} those in South Africa. The only difference {{being in the}} nature of the bounce.

25|$|The station {{buildings}} at Trawsfynydd {{were on the}} Down (northbound) side and provided a ticket office, waiting room, a lavatory and a urinal as well as rooms for staff use and a substantial signalbox on the platform.

25|$|Between Exeter and Newton Abbot the {{predominant}} speed limit is , the route availability is RA8, and freight loading gauge is W7. On the Paignton branch {{the predominant}} speed limit is , the route availability RA6, and the freight loading gauge W6A. Multiple aspect signals are controlled from the panel signal box at Exeter and allow a headway between trains of four minutes {{from there to}} Newton Abbot and seven minutes onwards to Paignton. The sea wall section is signalled for trains to run either way <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>up</b> (landward) line to allow for restricted working {{in the event of}} sea damage to the down line.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the signal}} boxes on the line bear {{original}} cast iron GWR name plates, with the sole exception being at Bridgnorth which has a replica. The SVR Kidderminster's name plate was recovered from another signal box that formerly stood <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>up</b> end of the down platform at Kidderminster station (Network Rail). The lever frame from the same signal box was reused at Arley, which has an LNWR signal box, originally from Yorton after the original was demolished. The replica name plate at Bridgnorth is made of fibre glass, {{although it is not}} known if it was moulded from the original or even if the original still exists.|$|E
