5|$|Petrodollar {{recycling}} {{is the international}} spending or investment of a country's revenues from petroleum exports ("petrodollars"). It generally refers to the phenomenon of major petroleum-exporting nations, mainly the OPEC members plus Russia and Norway, earning more money from the export <b>of</b> <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> than they could efficiently invest in their own economies. The resulting global interdependencies and financial flows, from oil producers back to oil consumers, can reach a scale of {{hundreds of billions of}} US dollars per year – including a wide range of transactions in a variety of currencies, some pegged to the US dollar and some not. These flows are heavily influenced by government-level decisions regarding international investment and aid, with important consequences for both global finance and petroleum politics. The phenomenon is most pronounced during periods when the price of oil is historically high.

Retention data of two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC GC) <b>of</b> 47 <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> samples have been used as input for modeling the corresponding IR spectra. A total of 10 different PLS prediction models have been built: 1 for the total sulfur content and 9 for the sulfur compound classes (1) sulfides, thiols, disulfides, and thiophenes, (2) aryl-sulfides, (3) benzothiophenes, (4) naphthenic-benzothiophenes, (5) dibenzothiophenes, (6) naphthenic-dibenzothiophenes, (7) benzonaphthothiophenes, (8) naphthenic-benzo-naphthothiophenes, and (9) dinaphthothiophenes. Research was carried out on a set of 47 IR spectra of which 28 were selected for calibration by means of a principal component analysis.
