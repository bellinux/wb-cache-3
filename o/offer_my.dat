I also appeal for a spirit of reconciliation and forgiveness amongst us all...Our beautiful country has been nicknamed `The Warm Heart of Africa' and we have been admired for our warmth and spirit of hardwork. This admiration calls not only for a need for us to look at our past and present and draw lessons from it, but there is even a greater need for us to look forward to the future in our endeavours to reconstruct and reconcile if we have to move forward at all.|$|E
500|$|The {{objective}} of the Japanese embassy was both to discuss trade agreements with the Spanish crown in Madrid, and {{to meet with the}} Pope in Rome. Date Masamune displayed a great will to welcome the Catholic religion in his domain: he invited Luis Sotelo and authorized the propagation of Christianity in 1611. In his letter to the Pope, brought by Hasekura, he wrote: [...] "I'll <b>offer</b> <b>my</b> land for a base of your missionary work. Send us as many padres as possible." ...|$|E

Since Blunt himself was fine with the parody, Yankovic decided to release [...] "You're Pitiful" [...] as a free digital download on his website, noting that, [...] "if James Blunt himself were objecting I wouldn't even <b>offer</b> <b>my</b> parody for free on my Web site.

500|$|The Florida recount {{was stopped}} {{a few weeks}} later by the U.S. Supreme Court. In the ruling, Bush v. Gore, the Justices held that the Florida recount was unconstitutional and that no constitutionally valid recount could be {{completed}} by the December 12 deadline, effectively ending the recounts. This 7–2 vote ruled that the standards the Florida Supreme Court provided for a recount were unconstitutional due to violations of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and further ruled 5–4 that no constitutionally valid recount could be completed by the December 12 deadline. This case ordered an end to recounting underway in selected Florida counties, effectively giving George W. Bush a 537 vote victory in Florida and consequently Florida's 25 electoral votes and the presidency. The results of the decision led to Gore winning the popular vote by approximately 500,000 votes nationwide, but receiving 266 electoral votes to Bush's 271 (one District of Columbia elector abstained). On December 13, 2000, Gore conceded the election. Gore strongly disagreed with the Court's decision, but in his concession speech stated that, [...] "for the sake of our unity as a people and the strength of our democracy, I <b>offer</b> <b>my</b> concession." ...|$|E
500|$|Jane Suuto was {{the joint}} oldest person to {{represent}} Uganda at the London Games {{at the age}} of 33. She had not entered any previous Summer Olympics. Sutto qualified for the Games because she achieved a third-place finish at the 2012 Riga Marathon with a time of two hours, 42 minutes and seven seconds, that met the [...] "B" [...] qualifying standard for her event, the women's marathon. In an interview with New Vision before she competed Suuto said: [...] "I will not promise a medal but I will go out there to <b>offer</b> <b>my</b> best and whatever God offers me.

Suuto ranked ahead of Yolimar Pineda of Venezuela (two hours, 45 minutes and 16 seconds) and Anikó Kálovics from Hungary (two hours, 45 minutes and 55 seconds) but was behind Kálovics's fellow countrywoman Zsófia Erdélyi (two hours, 44 minutes and 45 seconds).

500|$|... "I See You" [...] is a pop ballad, which {{lasts for}} a {{duration}} of four minutes and 20 seconds. It was composed {{in the key}} of A minor using common time and a slow groove at 72beats per minute. Lewis' vocal range spans two octaves, from the low note of F3 to the high note of F5, on the song. Ben Child for The Guardian likened the lyrics [...] "I <b>offer</b> <b>my</b> life as a sacrifice and live through your love" [...] to those performed by Dion in [...] "My Heart Will Go On". The lyrics are about encouraging a person to open their eyes and envisage a new and different world, and develop {{a new way of}} thinking. According to Lewis, the inspiration behind the song was all of the emotion, love and strength that is displayed by the characters in the film. [...] "I See You" [...] garnered a mixed response from music critics. Brian Linder for IGN praised Horner for asking Lewis to perform [...] "I See You", describing her as a [...] "vocal powerhouse," [...] but was unsure if the song would manage to achieve the same success as Dion's [...] "My Heart Will Go On". J. Hoberman for The Village Voice wrote that the closing credits features Lewis as a [...] "Celine Dion clone singing in Na'vi." ...|$|E
