5|$|A {{prominent}} {{attribute of}} Toraja language {{is the notion}} <b>of</b> <b>grief.</b> The importance of death ceremony in Toraja culture has characterised their languages to express intricate degrees <b>of</b> <b>grief</b> and mourning. The Toraja language contains many terms referring to sadness, longing, depression, and mental pain. Giving a clear expression of the psychological and physical effect of loss is a catharsis and sometimes lessens the pain <b>of</b> <b>grief</b> itself.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundComplicated {{grief is}} a {{prolongation}} {{of the normal}} grieving process with distinct characteristics. It impairs {{mental and physical health}} and can potentially greatly impact {{the quality of life of}} sufferers and their families. The prevalence and characteristics <b>of</b> complicated <b>grief</b> in the general population are currently unclear. The aims of the present study were therefore to evaluate the prevalence <b>of</b> complicated <b>grief</b> in a population-based cohort, examine the overlap between anxiety and depression and identify common bereavement-related and socio-demographic characteristics. MethodsBased within the Rotterdam Study, 5741 older adults were evaluated. Complicated grief was assessed with a 17 -item Inventory <b>of</b> Complicated <b>Grief.</b> ResultsPrevalence within the general population was 4. 8 %. Current grief was reported by 1089 participants, and of these 277 (25. 4 %) were diagnosed with complicated grief. Inflated anxiety and depression rates were documented in people with complicated grief, but the vast majority remained free from co-morbidity. Time since bereavement and relationship to deceased, particularly when the source was a spouse or child, were predictive <b>of</b> complicated <b>grief.</b> People with complicated grief were older, had a lower level of education, and more cognitive impairment. ConclusionsThe prevalence <b>of</b> complicated <b>grief</b> in older adults in the general population was noteworthy. Several factors were predictive <b>of</b> complicated <b>grief</b> and it was demonstrated as a separate condition to anxiety and depression. These findings highlight the need for prevention, diagnosis and treatment options for older adults with complicated grief and for recognition <b>of</b> complicated <b>grief</b> as a distinct diagnosis...|$|R

Charles University in Prague, Faculty of Arts, Institute of Information Studies and Librarianship, 2001. Thesis lead Vít Šisler. Abstract The goal of {{this thesis}} {{is to find out}} the {{frequency}} <b>of</b> <b>griefing</b> (harassment or intentional provocation of other players) among the players of the most popular genres of online games, and to determine the typical characteristics of griefers, based on following factors: age, gender, preferency of the game genres, and motivational factors of competition, socialization, and teamplay. The goal has been achieved through questionaire survey with the use of quantitative method. Among the most important findings belong that men are substantially more frequently griefers compared to women, griefers are more focused on competition than other respondents, approximately half of the surveyed players have commited griefing, and almost every player has been a victim <b>of</b> a <b>griefer.</b> It has also been found that griefers are more likely to identify themselves as victims <b>of</b> <b>griefing,</b> compared to the rest <b>of</b> players.

5|$|In places closely {{associated}} with Titanic, the sense <b>of</b> <b>grief</b> was deep. The heaviest losses were in Southampton, home port to 699crew members and also home {{to many of the}} passengers. Crowds of weeping women– the wives, sisters and mothers of crew– gathered outside the White Star offices in Southampton for news of their loved ones. Most of them were among the 549Southampton residents who perished. In Belfast, churches were packed, and shipyard workers wept in the streets. The ship had been a symbol of Belfast's industrial achievements, and there was not only a sense <b>of</b> <b>grief</b> but also one of guilt, as those who had built Titanic came to feel they had been responsible in some way for her loss.|$|E

40|$|Chronic {{grief is}} a normal {{response}} to lost, and can be persistant in parents of sick children, or acute when a dear person is lost. In this paper, the theoretical model <b>of</b> chronic <b>grief</b> is presented, a model that gives an alternative way to observe and react to experience <b>of</b> pain (<b>grief</b> and sorrow). While treating the medical condition of the patients, {{it is important to}} pay attention to his emotional condition, too. The concept of loneliness is connected to the theory oft he chronic grief, because the key component oft he loneliness and chronic grief is a lost. The theory <b>of</b> the chronic <b>grief</b> gives the guidelines to understanding and work with individuals who survived the important loss. Situation and circumstances that cause chronic grief and loneliness are identified and methods of management <b>of</b> chronic <b>grief,</b> considered as useful are described in this paper. The research on chronic grief includes qualitative methods, such as interviews face-to-face, or by phone, Burke/NCRCS questionnaire on chronic gried, instrument for evaluation <b>of</b> chronic <b>grief</b> by Kendall (Kendall Chronic Sorrow Instrument, KCSI), which has 18 parts and is designed to observe and measure the experience <b>of</b> chronic <b>grief.</b> The results have demonstrated that KCSI is valid and reliable, and adds to quantitative research on chronic grief. Empirical dana give means to ensure measurability of the defined atributes of loneliness. Modernization of society, technical and biomedical achievements, faster life style, loss of communication lead to loneliness and alienation. Future research should be focused on finding efficient internal methods <b>of</b> chronic <b>grief</b> management...|$|R

5|$|In September 1660, Consort Donggo, the Shunzhi Emperor's {{favourite}} consort, suddenly died as {{a result}} <b>of</b> <b>grief</b> over the loss of a child. Overwhelmed with grief, the emperor fell into dejection for months, until he contracted smallpox on 2 February 1661. On 4 February 1661, officials Wang Xi (王熙, 1628–1703; the emperor's confidant) and Margi (a Manchu) were called to the emperor's bedside to record his last will. On the same day, his seven-year-old third son Xuanye was chosen to be his successor, probably because he had already survived smallpox. The emperor died on 5 February 1661 in the Forbidden City at the age of twenty-two.|$|E

5|$|Because court {{statements}} did {{not clearly}} announce {{the cause of}} the emperor's death, rumors soon started to circulate that he had not died but in fact retired to a Buddhist monastery to live anonymously as a monk, either out <b>of</b> <b>grief</b> for the death of his beloved consort, or because of a coup by the Manchu nobles his will had named as regents. These rumors seemed not so incredible because the emperor had become a fervent follower of Chan Buddhism in the late 1650s, even letting monks move into the imperial palace. Modern Chinese historians have considered the Shunzhi Emperor's possible retirement as one of the three mysterious cases of the early Qing. But much circumstantial evidence—including an account by one of these monks that the emperor's health greatly deteriorated in early February 1661 because of smallpox, and the fact that a concubine and an Imperial Bodyguard committed suicide to accompany the emperor in burial—suggests that the Shunzhi Emperor's death was not staged.|$|E
