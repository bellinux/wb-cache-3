Anxiety informs us of <b>our</b> <b>choices,</b> our self-awareness and personal responsibility, and brings us from a state of un-self-conscious immediacy to self-conscious reflection. (Jean-Paul Sartre calls these terms pre-reflexive consciousness and reflexive consciousness.) An individual becomes truly aware of their potential through the experience of dread. So, anxiety may be a possibility for sin, but anxiety can also be a recognition or realization of one's true identity and freedoms.|$|E

In a 12 August 2007 New York Times review of Deathly Hallows, however, Christopher Hitchens praised Rowling for [...] "unmooring" [...] her [...] "English school story" [...] from literary precedents [...] "bound up with dreams of wealth and class and snobbery", arguing that she had instead created [...] "a world of youthful democracy and diversity".|$|E

2500|$|MacNeish’s {{ultimate}} {{goal was to}} make archaeology more of a science. [...] He was a processual archaeologist who championed the necessity of experimental archaeology and hypothesis testing in the exploration of human cultural ecology. [...] By adopting, creating or championing methods that made archaeological results more generalizable and amenable to hypothesis testing MacNeish was attempting to learn, and teach, about the broader patterns of social change that can inform <b>our</b> <b>choices</b> in the future; he wished to use archaeology to improve the human condition. [...] “…laws of cultural change may be of use not only in explaining the past, but more important, in predicting the future or at least indicating the steps in cultural change we might take in the future”. [...] His ultimate legacy, {{the sum total of}} all of his individual accomplishments in methodology and theory, was his commitment to archaeology as a science that could produce laws and theories to aid humanity in the future. In his autobiographical discussion of American archaeology (1978), MacNeish writes, “We are still fumbling along, perfecting techniques as well as improving methodology, and our field – as well as I – {{have a long way to}} go”.|$|E

[...] Voris declared, [...] "This is total propaganda. It blindly accepts all of the nonsense {{put out by the}} Climate Change crowd...it's disingenuous to pass this off as if it's the truth and accepted Catholic teaching." [...] He took umbrage that the Bishops called for Sunday homilies that coincided with Earth Day to be about climate change [...] "during the sacrifice of the Holy Mass", and suggested petitions be given at Mass to call for divine assistance in using [...] "our technological inventiveness to undo the damage we have done to Your creation". Voris declared such moves by the Bishops' groups as [...] "offensive to religious sensibilities...passing off as a truth something which is a lie or at best a mistake.
