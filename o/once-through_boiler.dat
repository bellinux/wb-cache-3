40|$|For the {{operation}} of the supercritical <b>once-through</b> <b>boiler</b> generation units, the control of the temperature at intermediate point (IPT) is highly significant. IPT is the steam temperature at the outlet of the separator. Currently, PID control algorithms are widely adopted for the IPT control. However, PID cannot achieve the optimal performances as the units’ dynamic characteristic changes at different working points due to the severe nonlinearity. To address the problem, a new control algorithm using affine nonlinear system is adopted for a 600 [*]MW unit in this paper. In order to establish the model of IPT via affine nonlinear system, the simplified mechanism equations on the evaporation zone and steam separator of the unit are established. Then, the feedback linearizing control law can be obtained. Full range simulations with the load varying from 100 % to 30 % are conducted. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm, the performance of the new method is compared with the results of the PID control. The feed-water flow disturbances are considered in simulations of both of the two control methods. The comparison shows the new method has a better performance with a quicker response time and a smaller overshoot, which demonstrates the potential improvement for the supercritical <b>once-through</b> <b>boiler</b> generation unit control...|$|E
40|$|As the {{important}} signal of <b>once-through</b> <b>boiler's</b> water-fuel ratio control, intermediate point temperature of supercritical boiler {{plays a key}} role in the decision of steam and water’s boundary, the match of fuel and water, the control of main steam temperature. The condition of its control directly impacts the <b>once-through</b> <b>boiler’s</b> safety and economy running. For an uncertainty model, a good control quality cannot be gained using the general PID controller when the unit load has great changes, so that the main steam temperature fluctuates greatly. According to this problem, a control system about intermediate point temperature of supercritical boiler based on active-disturbances-rejection multiple model was designed. Corresponding active disturbances rejection controller (ADRC) about different model in different operation points was designed. It can choose corresponding controller according to the operation condition so as to achieve an adaptive control of a wide range.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{explores the}} possibilities to reduce the pressure drop of a single-channel micro-evaporator. The availability of micro-technology to create three-dimensional structures at a micro-meter scale opens opportunities to better control process conditions in <b>once-through</b> <b>boilers.</b> However, process miniaturization possesses some inherent drawbacks as well. Among others, the relatively large pressure drop in a micro-system makes it rather unsuitable for low-pressure applications. Especially in phase-change processes, the pressure drop may become large due to the expansion in small-sized channels. To address this drawback, flow boiling relations for small diameter tubes are first studied. These relations show a general form of the empirical correlations. Using this formulation, reduction factors could be deduced for the momentum pressure drop and friction pressure drop {{in case of a}} conical channel. These theoretically derived reduction factors show that the total pressure drop can be reduced significantly. The momentum pressure drop completely vanishes for outflow/inlet diameter ratios of 6. 3 in the case of water. The friction pressure drop is reduced by a factor of ten at an outflow/inlet diameter ratio larger than four. An experimental comparison using a five-times diameter increase shows that the estimated reduction factor approaches the theoretically derived value for higher water supplies. cop. 2014 cop.

40|$|Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of the Loughborough University of Technology. The optimal estimation theory of the Wiener-Kalman filter is extended to cover {{the situation in which}} the number of memory elements in the estimator is restricted. A method, based on the simultaneous diagonalisation of two symmetric positive definite matrices, is given which allows the weighted least square estimation error to be minimised. A control system design method is developed utilising this estimator, and this allows the dynamic controller in the feedback path to have a low order. A 12 -order <b>once-through</b> <b>boiler</b> model is constructed and the performance of controllers of various orders generated by the design method is investigated. Little cost penalty is found even for the one-order controller when compared with the optimal Kalman filter system. Whereas in the Kalman filter all information from past observations is stored, the given method results in an estimate of the state variables which is a weighted sum of the selected information held in the storage elements. For the <b>once-through</b> <b>boiler</b> these weighting coefficients are found to be smooth functions of position, their form illustrating the implicit model reduction properties of the design method. Minimal-order estimators of the Luenberger type also generate low order controllers and the relation between the two design methods is examined. It is concluded that the design method developed in this thesis gives better plant estimates than the Luenberger system and, more fundamentally, allows a lower order control system to be constructed. Finally some possible extensions of the theory are indicated. An immediate application is to multivariable control systems, while the existence of a plant state estimate even in control systems of very low order allows a certain adaptive structure to be considered for systems with time-varying parameters...|$|E

40|$|In {{a thermal}} power plant with <b>once-through</b> <b>boilers,</b> it is {{important}} to control the temperature at the middle point where water becomes steam. However, there are many problems in the design of such a control system, due to a long system response delay, dead-zone and saturation of the actuator mechanisms, uncertainties in the system model and/or parameters, and process noise. To overcome these problems, an adaptive controller has been designed using neural networks, and tested extensively via simulations. One of the key problems in designing such a controller is to develop an efficient training algorithm. Neural networks are usually trained using the output errors of the network, instead of using the output errors of the controlled plant. However, when a neural network is used to control a plant directly, the output errors of the network are unknown, since the desired control actions are unknown. This paper proposes a simple training algorithm for a class of nonlinear systems, which enables the neural network to be trained with the output errors of the controlled plant. The only a priori knowledge of the controlled plant is the direction of its output response. Due to its simple structure and algorithm, and good performance, the proposed controller has high potential for handling difficult problems in process-control systems...|$|R

40|$|Representative boiling heat {{transfer}} and pressure drop information obtained primarily from past NASA and AEC programs is presented which is applicable to forced flow and <b>once-through</b> <b>boiler</b> systems.

It was found that in gas-fired systems particularly, the controlling heat transfer resistance may be on the hot side, so that increased fluxes would require extended surfaces. If in a power generation system the working fluid is very expensive, a forced flow boiler can be designed especially for small holdup volume. If the fluid is temperature sensitive, the boiling side wall temperatures can be tailored to maintain maximum heat transfer rates without overheating the fluid.

40|$|The EBBSG (External Boiling Bayonet Steam Generator) system, {{proposed}} in previous publications, offers {{an alternative to}} the classical once-through high pressure steam generators.

5000|$|The {{outcome was}} a {{complete}} redesign, the Model D of 1922. The uniflow engine, perceived as {{the root of the}} troubles with the Doble Detroit, gave place to a two-cylinder compound type, still with Joy's valve gear, but with piston valves. Another crucial development was a coiled monotube <b>once-through</b> vertically-mounted cylindrical <b>boiler</b> following the thinking behind the later version of the Detroit boiler, the most distinctive feature of which was the placing of the burner {{at the top of the}} boiler. This plus drastic insulation was meant to cause the hot gases to reside within the boiler casing for an optimum length of time giving up the maximum amount of heat to the feedwater. There was a forced draft burner at the top of the boiler and an exhaust flue at the bottom. The venturi was placed horizontally at the top of the vertical boiler barrel and oriented in such a way as to avoid direct contact with the monotube while inducing a swirl motion to the gases. It was thus a counterflow design with water entering the lower end of the coiled monotube and progressing upward toward the burner, which meant that the hottest gases gave superheat to the steam at the top of the coil whilst the cooler gases preheated oncoming the feedwater at the bottom. The distinctive hand operated [...] "miniature steering wheel” rotating a throttle control rod that passed down the middle of the steering column can be observed in D2 which still exists (in the UK) at the present time. Photographic evidence shows that D1 retained the foot throttle pedal, so when the wheel throttle control was first applied is not clear. The latter probably gave more precise adjustment.|$|R
40|$|In this study, a {{model for}} the {{unsteady}} dynamic behaviour of a <b>once-through</b> counter flow <b>boiler</b> that uses an organic working fluid is presented. The boiler is a compact waste-heat boiler without a furnace and it has a preheater, a vaporiser and a superheater. The relative lengths of the boiler parts vary with the operating conditions since they are all parts of a single tube. The present research is a part of a study on the unsteady dynamics of an organic Rankine cycle power plant {{and it will be a}} part of a dynamic process model. The boiler model is presented using a selected example case that uses toluene as the process fluid and flue gas from natural gas combustion as the heat source. The dynamic behaviour of the boiler means transition from the steady initial state towards another steady state that corresponds to the changed process conditions. The solution method chosen was to find such a pressure of the process fluid that the mass of the process fluid in the boiler equals the mass calculated using the mass flows into and out of the boiler during a time step, using the finite difference method. A special method of fast calculation of the thermal properties has been used, because most of the calculation time is spent in calculating the fluid properties. The boiler was divided into elements. The values of the thermodynamic properties and mass flows were calculated in the nodes that connect the elements. Dynamic behaviour was limited to the process fluid and tube wall, and the heat source was regarded as to be steady. The elements that connect the preheater to thevaporiser and the vaporiser to the superheater were treated in a special way that takes into account a flexible change from one part to the other. The model consists of the calculation of the steady state initial distribution of the variables in the nodes, and the calculation of these nodal values in a dynamic state. The initial state of the boiler was received from a steady process model that isnot a part of the boiler model. The known boundary values that may vary during the dynamic calculation were the inlet temperature and mass flow rates of both the heat source and the process fluid. A brief examination of the oscillation around a steady state, the so-called Ledinegg instability, was done. This examination showed that the pressure drop in the boiler is a third degree polynomial of the mass flow rate, and the stability criterion is a second degree polynomial of the enthalpy change in the preheater. The numerical examination showed that oscillations did not exist in the example case. The dynamic boiler model was analysed for linear and step changes of the entering fluid temperatures and flow rates. The problem for verifying the correctness of the achieved results was that there was no possibility o compare them with measurements. This is why the only way was to determine whether the obtained results were intuitively reasonable and the results changed logically when the boundary conditions were changed. The numerical stability was checked in a test run in which there was no change in input values. The differences compared with the initial values were so small that the effects of numerical oscillations were negligible. The heat source side tests showed that the model gives results that are logical in the directions of the changes, and the order of magnitude of the timescale of changes is also as expected. The results of the tests on the process fluid side showed that the model gives reasonable results both on the temperature changes that cause small alterations in the process state and on mass flow rate changes causing very great alterations. The test runs showed that the dynamic model has no problems in calculating cases in which temperature of the entering heat source suddenly goes below that of the tube wall or the process fluid...|$|R
