5|$|In Chicago, {{a man by}} {{the name}} of Henry Weems wins $100,000 playing poker against a mobster named Joe Cutrona, though Weems appears ignorant of the basic rules of poker. Suspecting that Weems cheated, Cutrona {{attempts}} to kill him by throwing him off the 29th story of the building they are in. After Weems lands in an access hatch to a basement, he stands right back up and walks away, completely uninjured. Two agents in a car stationed outside witness the event and eventually tell Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who promptly take the case. Mulder initially believes the man has the ability to cure himself, but Scully thinks he may just be very lucky by landing in a pile <b>of</b> <b>laundry</b> that was right under the access hatch.|$|E

25|$|At the inquest, {{the medical}} {{examiner}} explains that chloral hydrate {{was given to the}} victim before he was murdered. After the inquest, Edna Brent, one of the secretaries, expresses confusion at something said in evidence. She tries but fails to convey this to Hardcastle. She is soon found dead in a telephone box on Wilbraham Crescent, strangled with her own scarf. The dead man's identity is yet unknown. Mrs Merlina Rival (original name Flossie Gapp) identifies the dead man as her one-time husband, Harry Castleton. Colin leaves Britain on his own case, travelling behind the Iron Curtain to Romania. He returns with the information he needed, but not the person he hoped to find. Following Poirot's advice, Colin talks with the neighbours. He finds a ten-year-old girl, Geraldine Brown, in the apartment block across the street. She has been observing and recording the events at Wilbraham Crescent while confined to her room with a broken leg. She reveals that a new laundry service delivered a heavy basket <b>of</b> <b>laundry</b> {{on the morning of the}} murder. Colin tells Hardcastle.|$|E
500|$|In {{the decades}} {{following}} {{the adoption of}} the Fourteenth Amendment, the Supreme Court overturned laws barring blacks from juries (Strauder v.

However, in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), the Supreme Court held that the states could impose segregation so long as they provided similar facilities—the formation of the [...] "separate but equal" [...] doctrine.|$|E
500|$|The {{division}} {{moved to}} France in July 1915, where it held a sector near Ypres {{for the remainder}} of the year. It fought in an action at St. Eloi in March 1916, following which Douglas Haig considered relieving Pilcher of his command – he was not highly rated by his superior officers – but in the end his corps commander, Hew Fanshawe, was sacked instead. Pilcher was perceived by many as old-fashioned and disengaged, rarely visiting the trenches; the journalist Philip Gibbs remarked on his [...] "courteous old-fashioned dignity and gentleness of manner", but concluded simply that [...] "modern warfare was too brutal for him". Pilcher's command was certainly slack; an observer in the summer of 1916, recently appointed to 17th Division as a staff officer, recalled finding a completely disorganised unit, with no central co-ordination, no effective provision <b>of</b> <b>laundry</b> or comforts for front-line units, and described the divisional staff as simply [...] "of no value".|$|E

500|$|At {{the same}} time Shakira's album evoked sharp {{criticism}} {{by a number of}} authors. David Browne from Entertainment Weekly, for instance, called the album a [...] "the ultimate in crossover nightmares" [...] and opined that Shakira's incorporation of different musical genres made it sound confusing, saying [...] "Its wan ska-pop, faux-country ballads, and generic rock barely betray a Spanish accent or any musical heritage. (She can't decide if she wants to sound like Alanis or Shania)". Matt Cibula from PopMatters gave a more mixed view in his review <b>of</b> <b>Laundry</b> Service; he complimented some of the lyrics of the songs but expressed disappointment in Shakira's production of the album, writing it off as [...] "generic". He felt that the album was [...] "extremely safe" [...] and speculated that the reason behind the album's [...] "generic" [...] sound was due to the Estefans' involvement, saying [...] "when I read that she's [...] helping you with lyrics and he's [...] 'executive producer', and I hear the unmistakable hum of 'moneymoneymoneymoney' in the background [...]" [...] Ernesto Lechner from Rolling Stone complimented the singer's voice as a [...] "wild and beautiful instrument [...] capable of delivering scorching moments of musical passion," [...] but commented that the involvement of a [...] "battalion of producers and songwriters" [...] led to Shakira sounding [...] "downright silly" [...] on Laundry Service and also criticised [...] "her efforts to spice things up with obvious touches of Latin American folklore." ...|$|E
500|$|On 29 August 2002, Shakira {{performed}} [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards in New York City. Instead of tango, {{the performance}} of the song was inspired by samba and featured a large number of percussionists on the stage. Shakira incorporated belly dancing moves in her choreography and near {{to the end of the}} performance, she fell backward into the crowd and [...] "was delivered back to the stage quickly enough not to miss a single line." [...] Jon Wiederhorn from MTV praised Shakira's stage presence and called her belly dancing routine [...] "seductive." [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] was included in the setlist of Tour of the Mongoose, Shakira's first worldwide tour that was launched in support <b>of</b> <b>Laundry</b> Service. Similar to the MTV Video Music Awards, a samba-oriented version of the song was performed and it was the final performance before the encore segment. The performance boasted instrumentation from numerous bongo drums. Corey Moss from MTV opined that it [...] "featured Shakira's best belly dancing yet" [...] and [...] "had the audience screaming for an encore." [...] Steve Baltin from Rolling Stone selected {{the performance of}} the song as one of the highlights of the show, saying [...] "surrounding herself with bongo drums during [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] she embodied all the glitz and glamour of good old-fashioned rock & roll." [...] At the 2011 Latin Grammy Awards ceremony, Spanish music duo Estopa performed a live cover of the song in rumba as part of the Latin Grammys tribute to Shakira, where she was honored Latin Recording Academy Person of the Year.|$|E

With Benjamin Henry Latrobe, he helped lay out the design for the East and West Colonnades, small wings that help conceal the domestic operations <b>of</b> <b>laundry,</b> a stable and storage.

[...] "That bag is Caylee's coffin", Ashton said, holding up {{a photograph of the}} laundry bag, as Casey Anthony reacted with emotion. He further criticized the defense's theory that Caylee drowned in the Anthony pool and that Casey and George Anthony panicked upon finding the child's body and covered up her death.

She remembers a Nazi in a black uniform telling her at school that her brother was dead. She remembers running through the snow and losing one wooden shoe in an attempt to save him. She remembers discovering he truly was dead and lying in the snow, hoping for her own death. Hilde and Erika visit her old house and she recalls beatings; they then visit the pond where she is reminded of the many loads <b>of</b> <b>laundry</b> she was forced to wash with her mother. She begrudged the freedom of her brothers who were not forced to do work, her oldest sister, Renate, who lived with their grandparents, and her delicate sister, Monika, who was never asked to manage hard labor. They walk down the lane to the old school lined with apple trees; she recalls the rough feeling of cobblestones on her sore feet and the bitter taste of the small apples. She evades a certain barn on the lane and avoids looking out into the distance towards the area which was once the site of Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp.|$|E
