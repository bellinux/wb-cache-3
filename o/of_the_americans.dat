5|$|At {{this time}} {{operations}} were in train {{to drive the}} Japanese back to Salamaua. Once again, the difficulties of supplying the attacking force were formidable. Out of sensitivity towards the sensibilities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americans,</b> Herring left the command arrangements between Major General Stanley Savige's 3rd Division and units of the American 41st Infantry Division ambiguous. This backfired, producing acrimony between the Australian and American commanders. Herring prepared to fire Savige, but an investigation by Major General Frank Berryman determined that the dispute was not Savige's fault.|$|E
5|$|Before dawn on September 13, 1964, {{the ruling}} {{military}} junta of South Vietnam, led by General Nguyễn Khánh, was {{threatened by a}} coup attempt headed by Generals Lâm Văn Phát and Dương Văn Đức, who sent dissident units into the capital Saigon. They captured various key points and announced over national radio {{the overthrow of the}} incumbent regime. With the help <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americans,</b> Khánh was able to rally support and the coup collapsed the next morning without any casualties.|$|E
5|$|Carl Voss led {{the team}} with 18 assists and 31 points Howe led them in goalscoring {{registering}} 14, despite being traded midway through the season.

Bill Beveridge was the only goaltender the team used during the season. Out of his 11 wins three were shutouts.|$|E

5|$|Crawford led about 500 {{volunteer}} militiamen, {{mostly from}} Pennsylvania, deep into American Indian territory, {{with the intention}} of surprising the Indians. The Indians and their British allies from Detroit had already learned of the expedition, however, and gathered a force to oppose the Americans. After a day of indecisive fighting near the Sandusky towns, the Americans found themselves surrounded and attempted to retreat. The retreat turned into a rout, but most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> managed to find their way back to Pennsylvania. About 70 Americans were killed; Indian and British losses were minimal.|$|E
5|$|Early in the interwar period, he {{attended}} {{the dedication of the}} Liberty Memorial in Kansas City, Missouri, in honor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> who died in World War I, and met General of the Armies John Pershing, who commanded the American Expeditionary Forces in Europe during the war.

5|$|Eleven of {{the twelve}} USAF {{personnel}} lost {{on the day of}} the battle were listed first as missing in action (MIA), then later as KIA/body not recovered. Between 1994 and 2004, 11 investigations were conducted by both Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command (JPAC) and unilaterally by Lao and Vietnamese investigators on both sides of the border. In 2002 two of the former VPA soldiers who had taken part in the attack told investigators that they threw the bodies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> off the mountain after the attack as they were unable to bury them on the rocky surface.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1840s, California fought for its {{independence}} from Mexico in the Mexican–American War. The Santa Ana river played {{an important part in}} the victory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> over the Mexican army. In 1847, one year after the Bear Flag Revolt, a Mexican military force set out northwards to attack a smaller American force in the Los Angeles area. However, the Santa Ana River flooded, preventing the Mexicans from crossing the river to attack the Americans. When the river's flow finally subsided, the American forces had been reinforced enough to drive the Mexicans out of the region.|$|E

5|$|Upon the {{beginning}} of the American Revolutionary War, Spanish governor, Bernardo de Galvez, in New Orleans assisted the American rebels with weapons, food, blankets, tents and ammunition. The Spanish lieutenant governors at St. Louis also aided the colonials, particularly the forces of George Rogers Clark during the Illinois campaign. After the official entry of Spain into the American Revolutionary War in June 1779 on the side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> and the French, the British began preparing an invasion to attack St. Louis and other Mississippi outposts. However, St. Louis was warned of the plans, and residents began to fortify the town.|$|E

5|$|A {{month after}} Letcher signed the treaty, Clayton was {{replaced}} as Secretary of State by Daniel Webster. In response to concerns raised by one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> hoping {{to construct the}} line of transit, Webster asked that Letcher attempt to obtain certain modifications to the treaty. Letcher brought these modifications to the Mexican diplomats, but they steadfastly refused to accept them. Letcher, speaking {{with the blessing of}} the administration, intimated that the United States would take the region by force if the requested concessions were not made. The Mexican government conceded {{that they would not be}} able to resist such action, but still refused to accept the modifications to the treaty.|$|E

5|$|Although A Company, 1 RAR {{had been}} mauled, the {{experience}} of the Australians at Gang Toi was relatively minor when compared to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americans.</b> During fierce fighting the US 1/503rd Battalion had suffered 40 killed and 51 wounded, while more than 400 Viet Cong were believed killed. American claims were later raised to over 700 killed when captured documents revealed the losses caused by artillery and air strikes. Yet it was questionable as to whether such battles of attrition would be viable, while equally the American battalion had taken casualties far beyond what would have been politically acceptable for 1 RAR. Indeed, their losses had been significant, and although claimed as a victory, the Americans had failed to secure the area even if the Viet Cong had temporarily surrendered control of the battlefield. Ultimately, the communists continued to use the Bien Hoa area as a major supply route {{for the rest of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Although Lochry {{knew that}} he was in hostile territory, he landed his little {{flotilla}} after two days of nonstop travel because he needed to feed his men and horses. After landing, the Americans cooked fresh buffalo meat for breakfast and cut grass for their horses, apparently not taking proper security precautions. Concealed in the nearby woods, Brant repositioned his men and then opened fire, taking the Americans completely by surprise. Some Americans fought until their ammunition ran out, although others apparently did not have their weapons ready when the attack began. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> attempted to escape by boat, but Brant had anticipated this and had positioned men in canoes to cut off any retreat. Seeing that he was hopelessly trapped, Lochry called for his men to surrender.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{two sides}} were about even in number, Brant had won a {{lopsided}} victory. All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> were killed or captured; none of Brant's men were injured. According to a detailed list prepared by Brant and sent to Detroit, 37 Americans were killed and 64 were captured. Some of the American dead—some sources say most—had been executed after surrendering. This included Lochry, who {{was sitting on a}} log after the battle when a Shawnee warrior killed him with a tomahawk blow to the head. According to some accounts, Brant prevented the Indians from killing even more of the prisoners. The dead were scalped and left unburied.|$|E

5|$|At 1200, Mott {{was brought}} to the {{position}} of L Company commander Captain George F. Sharra. Mott ordered Sharra to take command and organize a retreat. Sharra ordered his three platoons to withdraw. A battalion of North Korean soldiers began moving down the pass towards the American positions. Men of I Company were forced to withdraw through rice paddies south of the pass, being strafed by mortar and machine gun fire in the process. They also had to cross a -wide stream in the retreat, and some drowned in the process. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> were forced to discard weapons, equipment and clothing in the retreat.

5|$|At the 2012 Summer Olympics, Sinclair {{broke the}} record of most goals scored in the Olympics for women's soccer, {{claiming}} the golden boot of the competition from two goals against South Africa, one against Great Britain, and three against the United States.

Canada was unhappy {{with the performance of}} referee Christina Pedersen, who made a series of controversial decisions in favour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americans.</b> Sinclair was ultimately fined a reported $3,500 and banned four matches for post match comments, which accused Pedersen of bias and deciding the result of the match before it had kicked off.|$|E

In early July, the 2/7th attacked Observation Hill and as the Japanese began to withdraw from Mubo, the 2/5th was sent north to act in support of the newly arrived Militia 15th Brigade, which was moving on Bobdubi Ridge. In mid-July, amidst heavy close-quarters fighting, the 2/5th Infantry Battalion captured the southern parts of Mount Tambu.|$|E
