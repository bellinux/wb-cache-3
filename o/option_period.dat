5|$|The low {{box office}} {{performance}} of 1983's Superman III made feature-film adaptations of comic book properties {{a very low}} priority in Hollywood until the 1990s. In 1985, after a brief option on Spider-Man by Roger Corman expired, Marvel Comics optioned the property to Cannon Films. Cannon chiefs Menahem Golan and his cousin Yoram Globus agreed to pay Marvel Comics $225,000 over the five-year <b>option</b> <b>period,</b> plus a percentage of any film’s revenues.

In June 1961 Fleming sold a six-month option on the film rights to his published and future James Bond novels and short stories to Harry Saltzman, {{with the exception of}} Casino Royale, which he had previously sold. Towards the end of Saltzman's <b>option</b> <b>period,</b> screenwriter Wolf Mankowitz introduced him to Broccoli, and Saltzman and Broccoli formed Eon Productions with the intention of making the first Bond film. A number of Hollywood studios did not want to fund the films, finding them [...] "too British" [...] or [...] "too blatantly sexual". Eventually the two signed a deal with United Artists for 100 per cent financial backing and distribution of seven films, with financing of $1million for the first feature. Saltzman and Broccoli also created the company Danjaq, which was to hold the rights to the films which Eon Productions was to produce.|$|E

40|$|Implied {{volatility}} (IV) {{is widely}} used in pricing options because traders believe that IV is {{the best predictor of}} exchange rate volatility. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange offers a continuous series of strike price options that can expire on more than one maturity date. This leads {{to the question of whether}} IV is also sensitive to the choice of the <b>options</b> maturity <b>period.</b> To examine this question, this study first chooses two types of options based on the maturity period: (1) within-month-maturity <b>options</b> with expiration <b>period</b> ranges from one day to one month; and (2) next-month-maturity options with an expiration period varying from one month to two months. The IV for within-month-maturity options (WMIV) and next-month-maturity options (NMIV) are estimated. Second, the realized volatility (RV) over the remaining life of the options is constructed from the daily return of exchange rate volatility. The RV for the within-month-maturity <b>options</b> expiration <b>period</b> (WMRV) and the next-month-maturity <b>options</b> expiration <b>period</b> (NMRV) is computed. Finally, graphical and statistical approaches are employed to assess the ability of WMIV and NMIV to explain WMRV and NMRV, respectively. The test results argue that the options with two maturities provide the IV with different characteristics. The analysis also shows that NMIV is superior to WMIV for explaining exchange rate volatility. Therefore, we assert that IV is sensitive to the choice of <b>options</b> maturity <b>period.</b> This novel approach can be used to select the <b>options</b> maturity <b>period</b> for the best IV estimation outcome...|$|R
