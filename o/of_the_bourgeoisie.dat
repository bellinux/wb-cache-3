5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, Brussels was still in many ways a medieval city. The royal quarter in the upper town, inhabited mainly by the nobility and the richer members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bourgeoisie,</b> was upscale and modern. The rest of the city, however, in particular the lower town, located in the western half of the Pentagon, was densely populated and industrial, characterized by an illogical street layout, back alleys, narrow streets, and numerous dead ends.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, the {{increase}} in the price of silkworm cocoons and the reduction in importance of silk in the garments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bourgeoisie</b> in the 19th century caused the decline of the silk industry in Europe. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 and the silk shortage in France reduced the price of importing Asian silk, particularly from China and Japan.|$|E
5|$|Some {{essential}} {{features of}} Modernisme were: an anticlassical language inherited from Romanticism with {{a tendency to}} lyricism and subjectivity; the determined connection of architecture with the applied arts and artistic work that produced an overtly ornamental style; the use of new materials from which emerged a mixed constructional language, rich in contrasts, that sought a plastic effect for the whole; {{a strong sense of}} optimism and faith in progress that produced an emphatic art that reflected the atmosphere of prosperity of the time, above all of the esthetic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bourgeoisie.</b>|$|E

5|$|Taraki's Government {{initiated}} a land reform on 1 January 1979 which attempted {{to limit the}} amount of land a family could own. Those whose landholdings exceeded the limit saw their property requisitioned by the government without compensation. The Afghan leadership believed the reform would meet with popular approval among the rural population while weakening the power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bourgeoisie.</b> The reform was declared complete in mid-1979 and the government proclaimed that 665,000 hectares (approximately 1,632,500 acres) had been redistributed. The government also declared that only 40,000 families, or 4 percent of the population, had been negatively affected by the land reform.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, {{water is}} seen as a common choice to drink with a meal. In the Middle Ages, however, {{concerns}} over purity, medical recommendations and its low prestige value made it less favored, and alcoholic beverages were always preferred. They were seen as more nutritious and beneficial to digestion than water, with the invaluable bonus of being less prone to putrefaction due to the alcohol content. Wine was consumed on a daily basis in most of France and all over the Western Mediterranean wherever grapes were cultivated. Further north it remained the preferred drink <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bourgeoisie</b> and the nobility who could afford it, and far less common among peasants and workers. The drink of commoners in the northern parts of the continent was primarily beer or ale.|$|E
25|$|Those representatives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bourgeoisie</b> {{who have}} sneaked into the Party, the government, the army, and various spheres of culture {{are a bunch}} of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once {{conditions}} are ripe, they will seize political power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into a dictatorship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bourgeoisie.</b> Some of them we have already seen through; others we have not. Some are still trusted by us and are being trained as our successors, persons like Khruschev for example, who are still nestling beside us.|$|E
2500|$|Stalin {{felt that}} {{socioeconomic}} transformation was indispensable to establish Soviet control, reflecting the Marxist-Leninist view that material bases, <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> means <b>of</b> production, shaped {{social and political}} relations.

50|$|A Marxist {{reading is}} {{possible}} with most {{if not all}} of Godard's early work. Godard's direct interaction with Marxism does not become explicitly apparent, however, until Week End, where the name Karl Marx is cited in conjunction with figures such as Jesus Christ. A constant refrain throughout Godard's cinematic period is that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bourgeoisie's</b> consumerism, <b>the</b> commodification <b>of</b> daily life and activity, and man's alienation—all central features of Marx's critique of capitalism.|$|R

25|$|Antwerp regained {{access to}} the sea and grew quickly as a major port and {{business}} centre.

In economics, therefore, the nobility declined while the middle class Belgian entrepreneurs flourished because of their inclusion in a large market, paving the way for Belgium's leadership role after 1815 in the Industrial Revolution on the Continent.|$|E
25|$|The 17th century {{saw more}} {{vineyards}} {{come under the}} control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bourgeoisie</b> as the church landholders began selling their lands to the wealthy from the nearby city of Dijon. In 1631, the Abbey of St-Vivant sold their holdings in the villages of Vosne-Romanée. The vineyard of Clos de Beze was sold by the Cathedral at Langres in 1651. Then in 1662, the Cistercians sold off all their vineyard holdings {{near the town of}} Fixin.|$|E

25|$|In {{the city}} of Astrakhan, strikers and Red Army {{soldiers}} who joined them were loaded onto barges and then thrown by the hundreds into the Volga with stones around their necks. Between 2,000 and 4,000 were shot or drowned between 12 and 14 March 1919. In addition, the repression also {{claimed the lives of}} some 600 to 1,000 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bourgeoisie.</b> Archival documents indicate this was the largest massacre of workers by the Bolsheviks before the suppression of the Kronstadt rebellion.|$|E

25|$|There were {{social changes}} {{as well as}} {{economic}} ones in Málaga during the reign of Isabel II—the bourgeoisie solidified its position as an oligarchy in control of local politics, while a labouring class of industrial workers developed in the factories. The presence of these large factories resulted in the growth of an industrial and workers' suburb {{on the banks of the}} Guadalmedina river, separate from the residential areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bourgeoisie</b> in the centre and the eastern part of the city. The city's population continued to grow, creating a need for the expansion of civil infrastructure.|$|E
25|$|Marie-Sophie Germain {{was born}} on 1 April 1776, in Paris, France, in a house on Rue Saint-Denis. According to most sources, her father, Ambroise-Franҫois, was a wealthy silk merchant, though some believe he was a goldsmith. In 1789, he was elected as a {{representative}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bourgeoisie</b> to the États-Généraux, which he saw change into the Constitutional Assembly. It is therefore assumed that Sophie witnessed many discussions between her father and his friends on politics and philosophy. Gray proposes that after his political career, Ambroise-Franҫois became {{the director of a}} bank; at least, the family remained well-off enough to support Germain throughout her adult life.|$|E
25|$|William was {{determined}} to create a united people, even though {{the north and south}} had drifted far apart in the past three centuries. Protestants were the largest denomination in the North (population 2 million), but formed a quarter of the population in the overwhelmingly Catholic South (population 3.5 million). Nevertheless, Protestants dominated William's government and army. The Catholics did not consider themselves {{an integral part of the}} United Netherlands, preferring instead to identify with mediaeval Dutch culture. Other factors that contributed to this feeling were economic (the South was industrialising, the North had always been a merchants' nation) and linguistic (French was spoken in Wallonia and a large part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bourgeoisie</b> in Flemish cities).|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> concept <b>of</b> Arab socialism, {{accused of}} being narrow-minded and nationalistic, was {{replaced}} with the [...] "Arab road to socialism" [...] concept.

Classical Ba'athists supported private ownership {{as a way to}} recruit into the party many petty bourgeois elements. The document called for nationalization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> commanding heights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economy, <b>the</b> slow incorporation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> petty <b>bourgeoisie</b> into <b>the</b> socialist economy and <b>the</b> elimination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> national <b>bourgeoisie</b> and its allied classes. To safeguard the party from evolving into one supporting state capitalism, the socialist economy would be controlled by a vanguard party together with popular participation from the toiler masses.|$|R
25|$|Macedonski's {{status as}} one of Romanian literature's greats was {{consolidated}} later in the 20th century. By this time, Noaptea de decemvrie {{had become one of}} the most recognizable literary works to be taught in Romanian schools. During the first years of Communist Romania, the Socialist Realist current condemned Symbolism (see Censorship in Communist Romania), but spoke favorably of Macedonski's critique <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bourgeoisie.</b> A while after this episode, Marin Sorescu, one of the best-known modernist poets of his generation, wrote a homage-parody of the Nights cycle. Included in the volume Singur între poeți ("Alone among Poets"), it is seen by critic Mircea Scarlat as Sorescu's most representative such pieces. Also then, Noaptea de decemvrie partly inspired Ștefan Augustin Doinaș' ballad Mistrețul cu colți de argint.|$|E
25|$|Manet's {{paintings}} of café scenes are observations {{of social life}} in 19th-century Paris. People are depicted drinking beer, listening to music, flirting, reading, or waiting. Many of these paintings were based on sketches executed on the spot. He often visited the Brasserie Reichshoffen on boulevard de Rochechourt, upon which he based At the Cafe in 1878. Several people are at the bar, and one woman confronts the viewer while others wait to be served. Such depictions represent the painted journal of a flâneur. These are painted in a style which is loose, referencing Hals and Velázquez, yet they capture the mood and feeling of Parisian night life. They are painted snapshots of bohemianism, urban working people, {{as well as some}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bourgeoisie.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{period of}} Liberal {{government}} (1820-1842) {{was marked by}} wars and guerrilla actions, but even so, many reforms and public works projects were introduced. The long-planned project to provide lighting in the city was finally implemented; and introduced in many private homes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bourgeoisie</b> between the years 1823 and 1837. Initially, lamps were lit by olive oil, and later fish oil, then were replaced by gas lamps in 1848. A new network of roads was constructed; and a line of steamships went into service linking Lisbon to Porto by sea. Plans were made to launch the construction of railways, but the war with the Conservatives made this impossible, and the first railroad line in Portugal, the Caminhos de Ferro Portugueses, between Lisbon and Carregado, would not open until 1856.|$|E
