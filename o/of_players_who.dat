5|$|Australia {{defeated}} South Africa 4–0 {{and senior}} {{players such as}} Bill O'Reilly were pointed in their comments about the enjoyment of playing under Richardson's captaincy. A group <b>of</b> <b>players</b> <b>who</b> were openly hostile toward Bradman formed during the tour. For some, the prospect of playing under Bradman was daunting, as was the knowledge that he would additionally be sitting in judgement of their abilities {{in his role as}} a selector.|$|E
50|$|Intuitively, we can {{eliminate}} a PBE {{if there is}} a type <b>of</b> <b>player</b> <b>who</b> wants to deviate even though he is not sure what the beliefs <b>of</b> other <b>players</b> are.

5|$|Sinden {{had changed}} the lineup and the Canadian goals were all scored by players Sinden had {{inserted}} in place <b>of</b> <b>players</b> <b>who</b> had played in Winnipeg.

According to Conacher, the Soviets used cross-ice passing in the attacking zone, a tactic that caused problems for Dryden. Serge Savard missed the game after fracturing his ankle in practice.|$|E
5|$|The London Symphony Orchestra (LSO), {{founded in}} 1904, {{is the oldest}} of London's symphony orchestras. It {{was set up by}} a group <b>of</b> <b>players</b> <b>who</b> left Henry Wood's Queen's Hall Orchestra because of a new rule {{requiring}} players to give the orchestra their exclusive services. The LSO itself later introduced a similar rule for its members. From the outset, the LSO was organised on co-operative lines, with all players sharing the profits {{at the end of each}} season. This practice continued for the orchestra's first four decades.|$|E

5|$|Many {{basketball}} analysts, coaches, fans, {{and current}} and former players consider James {{to be one of}} the greatest players of all-time, often ranking him as the best small forward and in the top five overall. He has earned All-NBA honors every season since his sophomore year, All-Defensive honors every season from 2009 to 2014, and was named Rookie of the Year in his debut season. With four MVP awards, he is part of a select group <b>of</b> <b>players</b> <b>who</b> have won the award four times, including Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Jordan, Wilt Chamberlain, and Bill Russell; James and Russell are the only two players who have won four MVP awards in a five-year span. While James has never won the Defensive Player of the Year Award, he has finished second in the voting twice and lists it as one of his main goals. James has appeared in the Finals eight times and won three championships. Some analysts have criticized him for not having a better Finals record, while others have defended him, arguing that James usually performed well but was defeated by superior competition.|$|E
