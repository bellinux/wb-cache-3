Second, Pandora pays licensing fees to agencies such as BMI, ASCAP, or SESAC in order to compensate composers, songwriters and publishers. Lastly, Pandora also pays Rovi for song and artist information; this has recently been structured as a flat monthly fee.|$|E

25|$|However, {{other forces}} may {{mitigate}} these processes. Some observe that {{a growing number}} of multinationals, especially from wealthier areas, are starting to see the benefits of keeping more of their operations close to home. For many products, labor is a small and diminishing fraction <b>of</b> <b>total</b> <b>costs.</b> Long, complex supply chains, it turns out, are likely riskier than many firms may have realized. For example, when an epidemic such as SARS hits Asia or when an earthquake hits Japan, supply chains are disrupted. Also, as emerging economies boom, wages there are rising. The benefits of global labor arbitrage may disappear, particularly in basic manufacturing and especially in China, where wages have been rising the fastest.|$|E

Fifteen percent <b>of</b> <b>total</b> cattle sold in the study area were brought from abroad and the rest (85 %) were locally purchased through Dalal.
