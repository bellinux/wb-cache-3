Following the encouragement of her mother, she decided to take up running. She would train at Mogadishu Stadium, as the family lived nearby in a hovel. The stadium had a gravel running track, pitted with mortar craters from the ongoing Somali Civil War. When not running at the stadium, she would run <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> Mogadishu, facing harassment from local militants who did not believe that Muslim women should participate in sporting activities.|$|E

5|$|John Tzimiskes first {{attempted}} to persuade Sviatoslav into leaving Bulgaria, {{but he was}} unsuccessful. Challenging the Byzantine authority, Sviatoslav crossed the Danube and laid siege to Adrianople, causing panic <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> Constantinople in summer 970. Later that year, the Byzantines launched a counteroffensive. Being occupied with suppressing a revolt of Bardas Phokas in Asia Minor, John Tzimiskes sent his commander-in-chief, Bardas Skleros, who defeated the coalition of Rus', Pechenegs, Magyars, and Bulgarians in the Battle of Arcadiopolis. Meanwhile, John, having quelled the revolt of Bardas Phokas, came to the Balkans with a large army and promoting himself as the liberator of Bulgaria from Sviatoslav, penetrated the impracticable mountain passes and shortly thereafter captured Marcianopolis, where the Rus' were holding a number of Bulgar princes hostage.|$|E
5|$|Merrick was now {{homeless}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> Leicester. His uncle, {{a barber}} named Charles Merrick, heard of his nephew's situation, sought {{him out and}} offered him accommodation in his home. Merrick continued to hawk around Leicester {{for the next two}} years but his efforts to earn a living met with little more success than before. Eventually, his disfigurement drew such negative attention from members of the public that the Commissioners for Hackney Carriages withdrew his licence when it came up for renewal. With young children to provide for, Charles could no longer afford to support his nephew. In late December 1879, now 17 years old, Merrick entered the Leicester Union Workhouse.|$|E

Meanwhile, Obi-Wan's young friend Anakin Skywalker commandeers a vacant starfighter and is able to destroy the Federation droid control ship in space, causing the entire droid army to deactivate. Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon, meanwhile, encounter the Sith Lord's apprentice, Darth Maul. Qui-Gon is mortally wounded in the battle, but Obi-Wan manages to kill the Sith apprentice.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Associations between traffic {{pollution}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>of</b> {{residence and}} a range of respiratory and allergic outcomes in children have been reported in developed countries, but little is known about such associations in developing countries. METHODS: The third phase of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) was carried out in 13 - to 14 -year-old and 6 - to 7 -year-old children across the world. A question about frequency <b>of</b> truck traffic <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>of</b> residence was included in an additional questionnaire. We investigated the association between self-reported truck traffic <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>of</b> residence and symptoms of asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis, and eczema with logistic regression. Adjustments were made for sex, region of the world, language, gross national income, and 10 other subject-specific covariates. RESULTS: Frequency <b>of</b> truck traffic <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>of</b> residence was positively associated with the prevalence of symptoms of asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis, and eczema with an exposure–response relationship. Odds ratios (95 % confidence intervals) for "current wheeze" and "almost the whole day" versus "never" truck traffic were 1. 35 (1. 23 – 1. 49) for 13 - to 14 -year-olds and 1. 35 (1. 22 – 1. 48) for 6 - to 7 -year-olds. CONCLUSIONS: Higher exposure to self-reported truck traffic <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>of</b> residence is associated with increased reports of symptoms of asthma, rhinitis, and eczema in many locations in the world. These findings require further investigation in view of increasing exposure of the world's children to traffic...|$|R
