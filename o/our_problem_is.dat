2500|$|This is {{a concept}} similar to Anselm's that we owe a debt of honor to God, with a {{critical}} difference: While Anselm said we could never pay this because any good we could do was owed to God anyway, Aquinas says {{that in addition to}} our due of obedience we can make up for our debt through acts of penance [...] "man owes God all that he is able to give him...over and above which he can offer something by way of satisfaction". Unlike Anselm, Aquinas claims that we can make satisfaction for our own sin, and that <b>our</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> not our personal sin, but original sin. [...] "Original sin...is an infection of human nature itself, so that, unlike actual sin, it could not be expiated by the satisfaction of a mere man." [...] Thus Christ, as the [...] "second Adam," [...] does penance in our place – paying the debt of our original sin. Why does he do that? By love. The whole of the work of redemption begins with God’s love: “God so loved the world that he gave his only Son” (Jn 3:16).|$|E

60|$|Now {{the sum of}} {{all that}} is merely OBJECTIVE, we will {{henceforth}} call NATURE, confining the term to its passive and material sense, as comprising all the phaenomena by which its existence is made known to us.

What the Facts privately known to Friedrich were, in what manner known; and how, {{in a more}} complex crisis than had yet been, Friedrich demeaned himself: upon which latter point, and those cognate to it, readers {{ought not to be}} ignorant, if now fallen indifferent on so many other points of the Affair.

Tragically howling round a man; who has to stand silent the while; and scan, wisely under pain of death, the altogether inarticulate, dumb and inexorable matter which the gods call Fact! Friedrich did read his terrible Sphinx-riddle; the Gazetteer tornado did pipe and blow. King Friedrich, in contrast with his Environment at that time, will most likely never be portrayed to modern men in his real proportions, real aspect and attitude then and there,--which are silently not a little heroic and even pathetic, when well seen into;--and, for certain, he is not portrayable at present, on our side of the Sea.

60|$|We are all {{likely to}} be more {{familiar}} with the theological history of the Israelites than with that of any other nation. We may therefore fitly make it the first object of our studies; and it will be convenient to commence with that period which lies between the invasion of Canaan and {{the early days of the}} monarchy, and answers to the eleventh and twelfth centuries B.C. or thereabouts. The evidence on which any conclusion as to the nature of Israelitic theology in those days must be based is wholly contained in the Hebrew Scriptures--an agglomeration of documents which certainly belong to very different ages, but of the exact dates and authorship of any one of which (except perhaps a few of the prophetical writings) there is no evidence, either internal or external, so far as I can discover, of such a nature as to justify more than a confession of ignorance, or, at most, an approximate conclusion. In this venerable record of ancient life, miscalled a book, when it is really a library comparable to a selection of works from English literature between the times of Beda and those of Milton, we have the stratified deposits (often confused and even with their natural order inverted) left by the stream of the intellectual and moral life of Israel during many centuries. And, embedded in these strata, there are numerous remains of forms of thought which once lived, and which, though often unfortunately mere fragments, are of priceless value to the anthropologist. Our task is to rescue these from their relatively unimportant surroundings, and by careful comparison with existing forms of theology to make the dead world which they record live again. In other words, <b>our</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> palaeontological, and the method pursued must be the same as that employed in dealing with other fossil remains.|$|E
