50|$|The Saint Lawrence River HVDC Powerline Crossing is the {{crossing}} of Hydro-Québec's Quebec-New England HVDC transmission line over (and later, under) the Saint Lawrence River between Grondines and Lotbinière, Quebec, Canada. The crossing is remarkable, for being first implemented as an <b>overhead</b> <b>crossing,</b> {{and then later}} replaced by a cable tunnel. Hydro-Québec wanted to complete the transmission line in time, which was only possible with an <b>overhead</b> <b>crossing</b> of Saint Lawrence River. However, due to the negative visual impact of the large towers of the <b>overhead</b> <b>crossing</b> on the local populations of Grondines and Lotbinière, {{it was decided to}} build a cable tunnel under the river, although this made the project more expensive.|$|E

50|$|Each truss is 103.7 metres long, 12.6 metres {{high in the}} middle, 8.2 metres wide, {{and weighs}} {{approximately}} 606 tonnes. Their design employs a double-intersection web system of diagonal members, based on the Linville system developed in the United States in the 1860s. They are strengthened by horizontal wind bracing at roadway level, and by elaborate <b>overhead</b> <b>cross</b> bracing.|$|R
50|$|Bosporus <b>overhead</b> line <b>crossing</b> 3 is {{the third}} <b>overhead</b> line <b>crossing</b> of the Bosporus. It is {{adjacent}} to the second crossing, and is designed for four 420 kV circuits, but can be used after some re-engineering work also for 800 kV lines. Since 1999, {{two of the four}} circuits are in use. The pylons on which the 1884 m crossing span is mounted are 160 m high.|$|R

50|$|The {{building}} {{also contains}} a manually operated overhead crane. Transverse movement of the crane is achieved {{by means of a}} simple chain and wheel mechanism. A similar chain and wheel raises and lowers a hook. This mechanism comprises a pulley and two back-to-back hooks. One of the hooks secures the mechanism to the <b>overhead</b> <b>cross</b> beam of the crane; the other dangles downwards for holding the load.|$|R

50|$|A {{special feature}} {{of the system is}} the <b>overhead</b> wire <b>crossing</b> at Friesenberg railway station, where line 32, {{energised}} at 600 V DC, crosses the Uetlibergbahn, which has a 1,200 V DC catenary. By contrast, the proposed electrification of motorbus line 62 did not proceed, because it would have had to cross an electrified SBB-CFF-FFS railway line. An <b>overhead</b> wire <b>crossing</b> at that point, Affoltern, was not approved on safety grounds, due to the high 15 kV AC voltage of the railway line.|$|R

50|$|In 1988 {{construction}} work for three artificial {{islands in the}} Saint Lawrence River, which were connected with jetties to the mainland as construction for the pylons of the <b>overhead</b> <b>crossing</b> started. Between July 1988 and spring 1989, 20,000 truck loads of 400000 t were transported. In 1989 the towers of the temporary overhead line crossing were erected. The suspension pylons {{on each side of}} the waterway were 140 m tall to ensure the required clearance.

50|$|Elbe Crossing 1 is a {{group of}} masts {{providing}} an <b>overhead</b> <b>crossing</b> of a 220 kV three-phase alternating current electric powerline across the River Elbe. Constructed between 1959 and 1962 as part of the line from Stade to Hamburg north, it consists of four masts. Each of the two portal masts is a guyed mast 50 metres in height with a crossbeam at a height of 33 metres. One of these masts stands on the Schleswig-Holstein bank of the Elbe and the other on the Lower Saxony bank. Two identical carrying masts 189 metres in height, each weighing 330 tons, ensure the necessary passage height of 75 metres over the Elbe. One stands on the island of Lühesand, the other in the Buhnenfeld on the Schleswig-Holstein side.|$|E
