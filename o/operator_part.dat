The modification of several promoter sequences is required to achieve appropriate {{regulation of}} the systems. However, a time-consuming process {{is required for the}} insertion of an operator, a binding site of a protein for gene expression, to the gene regulatory region of a plasmid. Thus, a standardized method for integrating operator sequences to the regulatory region of a plasmid is required. Results We developed a standardized method for integrating operator sequences to the regulatory region of a plasmid and constructed a synthetic promoter that functions as a genetic AND gate.

40|$|AbstractWe {{elaborate}} upon a {{new method}} of solving linear differential equations, of arbitrary order, which is applicable {{to a wide}} class of single and multi-variate equations. Our procedure separates the <b>operator</b> <b>part</b> of the equation under study in to a part containing {{a function of the}} Euler operator and constants, and another one retaining the rest. The solution of the equation is then obtained from the monomials (or the monomial symmetric functions, for the multi-variate case), which are the eigenfunctions of the Euler operator. Novel exponential forms of the solutions of the differential equations enable one to analyze the underlying symmetries of the equations and explore the algebraic structures of the solution spaces in a straightforward manner. The procedure allows one to derive various properties of the orthogonal polynomials and functions in a unified manner.

40|$|We present {{theoretical}} {{calculations of}} the ensemble-averaged (a. k. a. effective or coherent) wavefield propagating in a heterogeneous medium {{considered as one}} realization of a random process. In the literature, it is usually assumed that heterogeneity can {{be accounted for by}} a random scalar function of the space coordinates, termed the potential. Physically, this amounts to replacing the constant wavespeed in Helmholtz' equation by a space-dependent speed. In the case of acoustic waves, we show that this approach leads to incorrect results for the scattering mean-free path, no matter how weak fluctuations are. The detailed calculation of the coherent wavefield must take into account both a scalar and an <b>operator</b> <b>part</b> in the random potential. When both terms have identical amplitudes, the correct value for the scattering mean-free paths is shown to be more than four times smaller (13 / 3, precisely) in the low frequency limit, whatever the shape of the correlation function. Based on the diagrammatic approach of multiple scattering, theoretical results are obtained for the self-energy and mean-free path, within Bourret's and on-shell approximations.

Generalizations of the closed-graph theorem and the open-mapping principle for linear relations are established in terms of linear selections. The norm of the adjoint subspace of a closed linear relation M is shown to be equal to the norm of M without any restrictions on the domain of M. The rich structure of normed linear relations is uncovered via four fundamental concepts and tools: algebraic, topological, and proximinal operator parts, and the adjoint subspace of a linear relation. Notions of algebraic, topological, and orthogonal domain decomposability of linear relations in Banach spaces are studied, and the relationships between these notions of domain decomposability and the corresponding notions of operator parts are determined...|$|E
