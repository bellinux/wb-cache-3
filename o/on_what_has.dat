When some of the ships carrying the Acadians entered Boston Harbor in early December 1755, Shirley ordered that they not disembark. For three winter months, until March 1756, the Acadians remained on the ships, where half died from the cold weather and malnutrition.|$|E
5|$|Dylan's lyrics {{incorporate}} {{a wide range}} of political, social, philosophical, and literary influences. They defied existing pop music conventions and appealed to the burgeoning counterculture. Initially inspired by the performances of Little Richard and the songwriting of Woody Guthrie, Robert Johnson, and Hank Williams, Dylan has amplified and personalized musical genres. His recording career, spanning more than 50 years, has explored the traditions in American song—from folk, blues, and country to gospel, rock and roll, and rockabilly to English, Scottish, and Irish folk music, embracing even jazz and the Great American Songbook. Dylan performs with guitar, keyboards, and harmonica. Backed by a changing lineup of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> been dubbed the Never Ending Tour. His accomplishments as a recording artist and performer have been central to his career, but his songwriting is considered his greatest contribution. Since 1994, Dylan has also published seven books of drawings and paintings, and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} with clinical tools, one relatively inexpensive {{type of body}} fat meter uses the principle of bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) {{in order to determine}} an individual's body fat percentage. To achieve this, the meter passes a small, harmless, electric current through the body and measures the resistance, then uses information on the person's weight, height, age, and sex to calculate an approximate value for the person's body fat percentage. The calculation measures the total volume of water in the body (lean tissue and muscle contain a higher percentage of water than fat), and estimates the percentage of fat based on this information. The result can fluctuate several percentage points depending <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> been eaten and how much water has been drunk before the analysis.|$|E

The head of Liberty is dignified, but although the silly story has been started that the profile is that of a 'reigning belle' of New York, she can hardly be called a beauty; there is a suggestion... of the classic heads on some of the Roman coins, and a much stronger suggestion of the head on the French Francs of 1871 and onward... these coins are an advance <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> hitherto been accomplished, but there is yet a long distance between them and the ideal National coin." ...|$|E

500|$|... ere we have John Wayne, {{who was a}} major {{artistic and}} {{psychological}} figure on the American scene, ... who at one point used to make movies of soldiers who had a certain validity, ... {{a certain sense of}} honor [...] what the soldier was doing.... Even if it was a cavalry movie doing a historically dishonorable thing to the Indians, even as there was a feeling of {{what it meant to be}} a man, what it meant to have some sense of duty.... Now today we have the same actor making his new war movie in a war so hopelessly corrupt that, without seeing the movie, I'm sure it is perfectly safe to say that it will be an almost robot-view of soldiery, just by definition of how the whole country has deteriorated. And I think it would make a very interesting double feature to show a good old Wayne movie like, say, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon with The Green Berets. Because that would make a very striking comment <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> happened to America in general.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV, Usher commented that lyrically, 8701 represents his [...] "soul", and elaborated by explaining that he was inspired by love and heartache; [...] "I listen {{to a lot of}} Donny Hathaway's, Stevie Wonder's, Marvin Gaye's and Michael Jackson's earlier records, those Motown greats. There's a little bit of all of that in the album. I really appreciate what music was back then {{as well as in the}} early '90s when you had artists like Troop and Jodeci, and Michael Jackson was in his prime." [...] Usher explained that the album's lyrics also reflect <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> been going on with his relationship; 8701 is predominantly an R album. [...] "Can U Help Me", is about a deep relationship to which Usher experienced. [...] "U Don't Have to Call" [...] is a hip-hop song inspired by Jackson, while [...] "U Got It Bad" [...] is an R slow-jam. About [...] "U Got It Bad", Kyle Anderson of MTV wrote that it makes use of the acoustic guitar and a [...] "slow-burning bassline" [...] throughout. The album's lead single [...] "U Remind Me" [...] is also an R track, and its lyrics is based on meeting a woman who reminds Usher of an ex-girlfriend, and therefore cannot date her.|$|E
500|$|Feeder {{returned}} to the studio to record their fifth album Pushing the Senses.

It also seen a number of piano driven tracks, with [...] "Frequency" [...] being an example. [...] "Frequency" [...] was produced by Coldplay producer Ken Nelson, while {{for the rest of}} the album, Gil Norton was on production duties. Grant told Kerrang! in May 2004, [...] "I've done some recording on my own in a little studio up by where I live in North London. I demo the album in its full form before the rest of the band play on it. Its difficult to know at this stage what it will turn out like, but so far its slightly more mature sounding". Grant later added [...] "Each album is a journey and a reflection of the past, there is some stuff that touches <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> happened, but there are songs about love, songs of loss and songs about the future. I don't want to give too much away but there's one track called [...] "Bitter Glass". Its quite dark but uplifting too. Its about pulling yourself out of a big hole".|$|E
