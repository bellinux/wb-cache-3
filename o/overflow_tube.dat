25|$|Gitton's design {{relies on}} gravity {{powering}} multiple siphons {{in the same}} principle as the Pythagorean cup; for example, after the water level in the minute or hour display tubes is reached, an <b>overflow</b> <b>tube</b> starts {{to act as a}} siphon and thus empties the display tube. Actual time keeping is done by a calibrated pendulum powered by a water stream piped from the clock's reservoir. The pendulum has a carefully constructed container attached to it; this measures the water that is then poured into the display system. There are other modern designs of water clocks, including the Royal Gorge water clock in Colorado, the Woodgrove Mall in Nanaimo, British Columbia, and the Hornsby Water Clock in Sydney, Australia.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} common {{fail-safe}} systems is the <b>overflow</b> <b>tube</b> in baths and kitchen sinks. If the valve sticks open, rather than causing an overflow and damage, the tank spills into an overflow. Another common example is that in an elevator the cable supporting the car keeps spring-loaded brakes open. If the cable breaks, the brakes grab rails, and the elevator cabin does not fall.|$|E
50|$|Water {{used for}} rinsing and {{sanitizing}} is generally delivered directly through building water supply, {{and is not}} reusable. The used rinse water falls into the wash tank reservoir, which dilutes some of the used wash water and causes a small amount to drain out through an <b>overflow</b> <b>tube.</b> The system may first rinse with pure water only, and then sanitize with an additive solution that is left on the dishes as they leave the washer to dry.|$|E
40|$|An {{attempt is}} made to {{understand}} the morphology, formation and operation of lava tube systems in pahoehoe lava flows from evidence contained in lava tube caves (landforms resulting from the segmental drainage of lava tube systems). Twelve caves from five contrasting lava flows in Tenerife, Iceland and Sicily (Mt. Etna) are described and the morphogenesis of each is worked out from relationships between flow structure and cave form. The structural evidence adds support to the tube-forming processes previously observed by vulcanologists during periods of effusive volcanic activity. No evidence is found to support the currently popular 'layered lava' theory of cave genesis; instead, each cave is seen {{to be derived from}} a lava tube system which is a network of varying tube types. Knowledge of cave forms enables a visualization of the morphology of lava tube systems and the dynamics of the lava rivers they transport. Ideally, each system is sinuous and partly braided along the flow axis and terminates at a delta-like front, though complexities frequently arise as a result of such processes as stream piracy, the development of <b>overflow</b> <b>tubes</b> and the extension of the axial tube across former deltaic regions of the flow. Discussion of channel forms, comparison with other fluvial systems and knowledge of the efficiency of lava tubes in maintaining flow temperature and mobility suggests that lava tube systems are 'adjusted' forms: it is only through their construction that temperature and mobility are maintained sufficiently to enable the continued advance of the flow front downslope. At the front lava emerges from the tube system as a jet flow. As a result, it is argued that the development of pahoehoe lava flows is predictable and amenable to future quantification through the application of jet theory...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{studies of}} {{externally}} registered indicator dilution curves show a {{relation between the}} height of the curve and the detected volume. If this re lationship were established on a quantitative basis {{it might be possible to}} de termine the volume difference between paired organs or symmetrical locations in the body from the difference between two detected volumes. Cardiac stroke volume might also be measured from the difference between diastolic and sys tolic volumes. A systematic series of experiments were first carried out on models to determine the feasibility of such measurements. This paper presents the results of studies with single tube model systems in which the height of externally registered dilution curves are measured at different detected volumes. The quantitative relationship between these two variables is determined and the effect of dilution volume and flow rate on the height is evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHOD Various model systems are used but certain features are common to all (Figs. 1, 2). Flow is maintained by means of a centrifugal pump emersed in a basin fed by running water from a wall faucet. The water level is kept constant by means of an <b>overflow</b> discharge <b>tube.</b> Rate of flow from the pump to the tubing is regulated by a hand operated screw valve.

40|$|Lava tubes {{have the}} {{potential}} to serve as a sustainable solution to long-term lunar habitation by providing protection from radiation and micrometeorite bombardment while potentially providing resources in the form of trapped water ice. They also pose compelling science targets in their own right. While the potential benefits of utilizing lunar lava tubes is clear, their discovery is less straightforward. Formation processes for lava tubes do not always result in a surface expression, making their discovery using remotely sensed imagery difficult. Furthermore, there is the potential for lava tubes to be covered by secondary lava flows, impact ejecta, or other deposits, masking their surface expression. We demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} detect and characterize subsurface lunar lava tubes with little or no surface expression through the integration of topographic and thermal inertia measurements derived from Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) data. We create topographic, thermal inertia, and morphologic maps over four potential lunar lava tube candidates. We are able to detect a thermal inertia high along the trend of the lava tube candidates, which we believe is the combined result of the subsurface lava tube void space and variations in the thickness and thermophysical properties of the lunar regolith over and adjacent to the subsurface cavity. The thermal inertia results are supported by the presence of a cylindrical, curvilinear topographic high along the trend of the thermal inertia high, specifically at the Ingenii Hole 2 ̆ 2 skylight 2 ̆ 2 location, which is inferred to result from <b>overflow</b> lava <b>tube</b> formation processes. The effectiveness of these new detection methods is supported by a periodic heating and cooling finite element model developed to determine the influence a subsurface cavity would have on surface temperatures. The modeled diurnal surface temperature pattern at a point over a subsurface tube agrees with observations made by the LRO Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment (DLRE). ...|$|R
50|$|Toward {{the end of}} the {{discharge}} process, the ballcock responds to the drop in water level and refills the tank. Should the float or valve fail and allow the water level to exceed the fill line, the water will pour into the <b>overflow</b> <b>tube</b> and out to the bowl (in the flapper valve type) or to an outside drain (in the siphon type). Although this does not stop the wastage of water, it avoids the flooding that would otherwise occur after a single-point valve failure.|$|E
5000|$|When a toilet's handle is turned, a {{discharge}} {{mechanism is}} activated {{by means of}} a rod or chain. The mechanism may be a flapper valve, which is designed to sink more slowly than the water, which will exit to the toilet bowl below, so that the tank may empty. As the tank water level drops, the float descends and actuates the fill valve. Water is fed to the tank to replenish its supply, and a smaller flow is directed into the <b>overflow</b> <b>tube</b> to refill the bowl. Once the flapper valve closes, the water flow from the fill valve continues until the tank level again reaches the fill line.|$|E

40|$|The {{traditional}} hydrocyclone {{can only}} obtain two products: overflow and underflow. In the paper, we propose three-products hydrocyclone with double vortex finders. The hydrocyclone is designed with two coaxial overflow tubes with different diameters. During overflow, light and fine particles {{exit from the}} inner <b>overflow</b> <b>tube.</b> The mid-size particles overflow from the outer <b>overflow</b> <b>tube,</b> and the coarse particles through the underflow pipe. Therefore, one classification can obtain three different narrow-grade-classification products. The inner vortex finder length is the important influent factor on the flow performance of the hydrocyclone.

40|$|Following {{the work}} on gas lift reactor (Pachuca tank) for gas-liquid-suspended solid 3 -phase reaction,multideck gas lift {{reactors}} have been developed. This type of reactor has many unique advantages suchas realization of counter-current operation between gas and slurry,reduction of gas consumption and lower-ing {{of the amount of}} volatile components of the liquid which has to be recovered from the exit gas. The stability of the <b>overflow</b> <b>tube</b> of the reactor was studied. A semiempirical equation was derived tocalculate the flooding point of the reactor. The operating range of the <b>overflow</b> <b>tube</b> was also deter-mined. This multideck reactor has been operated successfully in a pilot plant of ammonia leaching of copperore. Results agree reasonably well with those predicted from small scale batch experiments.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to determine the velocity profiles of a swirling flow in a flat bottom cyclone, a cylindrical vessel with central discharges used for classifying or separating particles in industrial processes. A two component laser Doppler velocimeter was used to measure the axial and the tangential component of velocity. A perspex model of a flat bottom cyclone 310, 5 mm high and with a diameter of 102 mm was installed in an experimental rig under controlled water flow conditions. The velocity profiles were measured for two different <b>overflow</b> <b>tube</b> (vortex finder) diameters and three different values of pressure drop pD in the cyclone. For each cyclone, three different values of both under flowrate through the apex tube and over flowrate through the vortex finder were thus originated, the Reynolds number Re varying in the range 410371 x, ¸ 410802 x,. Velocity data were measured on four symmetrical vertical halfplanes of azimuthal coordinates q = 0 º, 90 º, 180 º, 270 º respectively. The experimental results have shown that the flow is approximately a forced vortex near the air core and a free vortex in the region between the radial coordinate of M,vq, the maximum of the tangential velocity, and the solid wall. The value of M,vq grows with Dp and it is virtually the same for changes in z. Th...|$|E
30|$|The {{definitive}} 96 -h {{test with}} fish {{was conducted at}} nominal PSOA concentrations of 0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5 and 1  mg/L with a solvent and untreated control and continuous flow conditions. Seven fish were randomly added to each tank {{at the start of}} the exposure phase. For determination of the PSOA concentration, samples were taken from the testing concentrations and the controls at − 24, 0, 24 and 96  h. For each test concentration, RFW was passed from a header tank into a pre-exposure glass mixing vessel containing a magnetic follower. The nominal flow rate of RFW to each mixing vessel was 35  mL/min which equated to five volume replacements per tank every 24  h. The water was mixed with a continuous flow of stock solution of PSOA in acetone or acetone alone for the solvent control. The stock solutions were contained in Becton–Dickinson syringes equipped with a 16 -gauge Teflon syringe infusion tube and delivered using Medfusion Syringe Infusion Pumps, Model 2001. Stock solutions at the appropriate concentration were delivered to the mixing vessel at a rate of 0.21  mL/h where they were mixed with the dilution water. The test solutions flowed through tubing directly to the appropriate tank at a continuously controlled flow rate. Excess solution was siphoned off with an <b>overflow</b> <b>tube.</b> The delivery of solutions to the solvent and non-solvent control tanks was identical to the treated tanks but excluded PSOA. The solvent control received acetone only from the infusion pump, which was mixed with RFW and the non-solvent control received only RFW. Dose solution delivery rates were confirmed daily for each tank by collecting the outflow of dose solution over a timed interval and measuring the volume. Temperature, pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen concentration and hardness of test water were also monitored throughout the study. During the in-life phase of the test, fish were observed at 1, 4, 24, 48, 72 and 96  h. Incidence of fish death was recorded and abnormalities noted. At the conclusion of the study, the length and weight of surviving fish were recorded.|$|E
40|$|CO 2 capture from {{exhaust gases}} {{has been paid}} more and more {{attention}} {{in order to avoid}} global warming. One of the methods for removing CO 2 from the flue gas streams is the use of absorption and aqueous alkanolamine solutions as absorbents. Alkanolamines such as monoethanolamine (MEA), diethanolamine (DEA) and N-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) are widely used in CO 2 capture because of their high CO 2 absorbing capacity and lower energy consumption. Physical properties such as density and surface tension of the pure compounds of amines, the mixtures with water and CO 2 loaded aqueous amine solutions are important for optimal designing of absorption-desorption processes and the related engineering calculations. The absorption of CO 2 into aqueous amine solutions by the spray method is a possible process for bulk removal of CO 2 from a gaseous stream. A deep understanding of the mass transfer characteristics in the spray column is very important for the optimization design of the column and the selection of absorbent. The study of mass transfer between CO 2 and the unit part of a spray - individual droplets is crucial for better understanding the mass transfer characteristics in the spray column. In this work, densities in liquid solutions of water + monoethanolamine (MEA), water + diethanolamine (DEA) and water + N-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) have been measured at temperatures from (298. 15 to 423. 15) K by Anton Paar density meters DMA 4500 and DMA HP. The mass fraction of amine ranged from 0. 3 to 1. 0. Excess molar volumes of the binary system were derived and correlated by a Redlich-Kister equation. The model uses a third order Redlich-Kister equation and a linear relationship with the temperature for unloaded aqueous MEA solutions, while a fourth order Redlich-Kister equation and a second polynomial function with respect to the temperature for unloaded aqueous DEA and MDEA solutions. Densities of CO 2 loaded aqueous MEA solutions (water + MEA + CO 2) were measured at temperatures from (298. 15 to 413. 15) K by Anton Paar density meters DMA 4500 and DMA HP. The mass fraction of MEA in water was 0. 3, 0. 4, 0. 5 and 0. 6. Densities in liquid solutions of water + DEA + CO 2 and water + MDEA + CO 2 were measured at temperatures from (298. 15 to 423. 15) K by Anton Paar density meters DMA 4500 and DMA HP. The mass fraction of DEA and MDEA in water was 0. 3 and 0. 4. The CO 2 loading ranged from 0. 1 to 0. 5. Molar volumes of the ternary system were derived and correlated by the equation from Weiland et al. at each temperature. The parameters were in turn fitted by a polynomial function of the temperature. The agreement between the measured density results and the correlated data is good. The uncertainties of density measurements were analyzed. Surface tensions of aqueous MEA solutions were measured at temperatures from (303. 15 to 333. 15) K by the sessile drop method. A Rame-Hart Model 500 Advanced Goniometer with DROPimage Advanced v 2. 4 was employed. The mass fraction of MEA ranged from 0 to 1. 0. Measured surface tensions of aqueous MEA solutions in this work were compared with Vázquez et al. ?? data. The experimental surface tensions were correlated with temperature by a linear relationship. The correlated surface tensions by the linear equation and the experimental data have very good agreement. The surface tensions of aqueous MEA solutions were correlated with mole fraction of MEA by both an empirical model and the chemical model. The chemical model shows better agreement with the experimental surface tension data than the empirical model. The uncertainties of surface tension measurements were analyzed. In order to study the mass transfer characteristics between CO 2 and liquid droplets, a novel experimental set-up was constructed. This system produces individual droplets by pushing the liquid through a needle with the help of pressurized nitrogen. The droplets fall through a gas chamber one by one and finally deposit under kerosene. Pure CO 2 is filled in the gas chamber to eliminate the gas side mass transfer resistance. A temperature control box was built outside the chamber in order to perform the absorption experiments under controlled temperatures. The pressure inside the chamber keeps constant and the same as the atmosphere by an overflow section. The experiments can be performed at different droplet falling heights by adjusting the length of the <b>overflow</b> <b>tube.</b> The volume flow rate of CO 2 was measured by a soap film flow meter to calculate the absorption rate. A high speed camera system was used to determine the size of droplet, droplet formation time and droplet formation rate. The absorption of CO 2 into the kerosene can be measured before the droplets start dripping. The results from this blank experiment will be subtracted to determine the concentration of CO 2 that is absorbed by liquid droplets. Because the density of kerosene is much smaller than the solvent, the droplets deposit under kerosene very fast. Hence, the coalescence effect can be eliminated. The liquid phase mass transfer coefficients of CO 2 absorption by liquid droplets were measured at different temperatures, droplet formation times and droplet falling heights. Physical absorption (CO 2 + water droplets) and chemical absorption (CO 2 + droplets of 30 % MEA solutions) were both investigated. The liquid phase mass transfer coefficients of CO 2 absorption into water droplets during droplet life-time (formation and fall together) were measured at temperatures T = 303. 65 K and 323. 15 K, droplet falling heights h = 0. 41 m and 0. 59 m, and droplet formation times t 1 = (0. 352 to 2. 315) s. It was found that there exists convection inside the water droplets which significantly enhances the mass transfer between CO 2 and water droplets. The convection increases as the droplet formation time decreases. The absorption rates of CO 2 into water droplets during droplet formation were measured at different droplet formation times and temperatures T = 297. 15 K and 323. 15 K. The measured absorption rates of CO 2 absorption into water droplets during formation at 297. 15 K agree well with Dixon and Russell?? data. The correlation of the absorption rate of CO 2 into water droplets during formation with droplet formation time at 323. 15 K was determined. The correlation between the Sherwood number and the Reynolds number of CO 2 absorption by water droplets during droplet fall at 323. 15 K was obtained. The absorption rates of CO 2 into droplets of 30 % MEA solutions during droplet formation were measured at 323. 15 K and different droplet formation times. It was found that the mass transfer between CO 2 and droplets of 30 % MEA solutions was not affected by the droplet formation time, which is probably because the convection inside droplets of 30 % MEA solutions is small and the intensity of convection does not change very much over the range that these measurements covered. The liquid phase mass transfer coefficients of CO 2 absorption into droplets of 30 % MEA solutions during droplet life-time (formation and fall together) were measured at temperatures T = 303. 65 K and 323. 15 K, and droplet falling heights h = (0. 07 to 0. 53) m. The correlation between the Sherwood number and the Reynolds number of CO 2 absorption by droplets of 30 % MEA solutions during droplet fall at 323. 15 K was obtained. The enhancement factors of CO 2 absorption by droplets of 30 % MEA solutions are estimated. The liquid phase mass transfer coefficients without chemical reaction for CO 2 into water droplets and that for CO 2 into droplets of 30 % MEA solution are compared...|$|E
