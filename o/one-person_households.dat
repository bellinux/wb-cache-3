OBJECTIVES: We set out to examine whether people residing in socially deprived communities are at higher mortality risk from ambient air pollution. METHODS: This study included 209 tertiary planning units (TPUs), the smallest units for town planning in the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong, China. The socioeconomic status of each TPU was measured by a social deprivation index (SDI) derived from the proportions of the population with a) unemployment, b) monthly household income < US$ 250, c) no schooling at all, d) <b>one-person</b> <b>household,</b> e) never-married status, and f) subtenancy, from the 2001 Population Census. TPUs were classified into three levels of SDI: low, middle, and high. We performed timeseries analysis with Poisson regression to examine the association between changes in daily concentrations of ambient air pollution and daily number of deaths in each SDI group for the period from January 1996 to December 2002.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} impact of the family network on the {{start-up}} decision byidentifying domestic drivers and barriers to entrepreneurship. For this, we used anadjusted model of work-family conflict theory, with special attention to the family lifecycle stages. In order to identify the drivers and barriers, 45 semi-structured interviewswith young start-up entrepreneurs were conducted. The findings in this study show that being in a <b>one-person</b> <b>household,</b> allows fulldevotion to the start-up life but there is lower intra-household social capital. Two- person households have the benefit of intra-household social capital but family timedemands and family involvement are higher, often leading to time and strain basedconflicts. Support from the partner is especially important with the presence of youngchildren who increase the family time demands and family involvement that are barriers, but this reduces with age. The findings indicated that the domestic network exerts influence on the moment tostart the company. This depends mainly on the level of family time demands, familyinvolvement and the fixed costs of living. New concepts like family life cycle stagesand low and flexible living costs, should therefore be added to work-family conflictmodels used in future entrepreneurship researc...|$|R

Across Asia the {{phenomenon}} is common in parts of East Asia, but has rarely been examined in South or Southeast Asia. Objective : The authors seek to establish from the evidence of censuses the main contours of living alone in South and Southeast Asia, and in doing so address issues of definition and measurement, particularly issues arising due to differences in the census handling of the 'group quarters' type of household. Methods : The paper examines 10 national censuses in the IPUMS archive of census micro-files. The data are explored for age profiles of living alone by sex, classified by urban versus rural residence and marital status. Results : The censuses reveal a combination of underlying commonalities among the countries and dates as well as distinct national features. There are distinct age profiles for males and females, and profiles typical of urban and rural sectors across countries. Living alone in group quarters is most common among young adults. Tabulation by marital status shows considerable variation among single young adults and elderly widowed or divorced/separated persons. It is also found that the proportions of the population not living with core family who are living alone vary widely by age and sex and across countries and years. Conclusions : Studies of living alone with national censuses must take note of whether conventional households and group quarters are included and how these are defined.

40|$|Since 1989 Poland {{has been}} {{experiencing}} large-scale {{social and economic}} changes {{as a result of}} the reforms associated with the transition to a market economy. This study uses a 1996 Health Survey of over 20, 000 women to examine the impact of the new socio-economic situation and of women's multiple roles on their health at the early stage of transition. We investigated the importance of selected economic, socio-demographic and cultural determinants in explaining differences in women's health status in Poland, focusing on education level, (un) employment, living conditions, marital status, smoking and life style. There are health inequalities between men and women in Poland based on life expectancy, chronic diseases and health self-assessment. Some of these, especially the large differences between life expectancy at working ages, may be attributed to the difficult socio-economic situation. The multivariate analysis of women's self-assessed health and morbidity from selected chronic diseases indicated substantial inequalities in health. Together with the behavioural and cultural risk factors recognized by medicine, such as obesity, lack of physical exercise and smoking, the paper shows the crucial role of economic factors in influencing Polish women's health. Women whose financial position is poor are more likely to assess their health as less than good, to suffer from respiratory and circulatory systems' diseases and report neurotic problems. Other factors, strongly connected with the transition process in Poland, which contribute to health problems are lack of employment and low educational level, particularly for younger women. Women's marital and parental status are also important predictors of some categories of health problems; however, their influence varies for women of different ages. Our survey also supports the thesis that loneliness in old age, defined on the basis of living in a <b>one-person</b> <b>household,</b> may be negatively correlated with health status.

To study {{sex differences}} in consequences of musculoskeletal pain (MP) : limited functioning, work leave or disability, and healthcare use. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA. MP is a major public health problem in developed countries due to high prevalence rates and considerable consequences. There are indications that consequences of MP differ for men and women. METHODS. Data of a Dutch population-based study were used, limited to persons 25 to 64 years of age (n = 2517). Data were collected by a postal questionnaire. RESULTS. Women with any MP report more healthcare use for MP, i. e., contact with a medical caregiver and use of medicines than men, while men report more work disability (ever in life) due to low back pain only, irrespective of work status. None of the sex differences {{can be explained by}} age, household composition, educational level, smoking status, overweight, physical activity, and pain catastrophizing. Older age was related to more limited functioning due to MP (women), work disability due to MP (men), and healthcare use due to MP (men and women). A <b>one-person</b> <b>household</b> was associated with work disability (women) and use of medicines (men). Low educational level was associated with limited functioning (men), work leave (men), contact with a medical caregiver (men), and work disability (men and women). Smoking was associated with limited functioning (men), work leave (women), and healthcare use (women). Physical inactivity was associated with limited functioning due to MP in women. Pain catastrophizing was associated with limited functioning, work leave, and healthcare use (men and women) and work disability (men). CONCLUSIONS. Consequences of MP show a slightly different pattern for men and women. Women with any MPreport more healthcare use for MP, while men report more work disability due to low back pain only. These sex differences can not be explained by general risk factors, but associations between these factors and consequences of MP show some sex differences...|$|R

This rapid demographic change poses immense challenges for sustainable urban development and public health (Woo 2013).

Moreover, the percentage of persons aged 65 and above, who belong to <b>one-person</b> domestic <b>households,</b> accounted for 14.8 % of all households in 2014 (HKCSS 2016).

Instead of being involved in their society, women worked as trade intermediaries and were expected to marry and become housewives. This shift in gender roles became a new cultural practice and lasted for years until the Vietnam War, when women in rural Vietnam became discouraged from marrying and female singlehood became a growing trend. A common belief was that after the mid-twenties, women were considered undesirable and marriage was a way of life. The cap for marriage was at this age because after this time, women could no longer bare children, a necessity for the survival of the family name. In addition, the notion of [...] "a <b>one-person,</b> self-sufficient <b>household</b> was not very acceptable" [...] and was looked at as selfish and lonely. After the age of twenty-five, single women enter a period where they [...] "make the transition from temporary to permanent non-marriage."

40|$|Housing {{has ever}} been the major concern of Hong Kong people. The housing prices of Hong Kong have fluctuated up and down largely {{in the past two}} decades. Housing prices reached a new record high in December 2013. Although the housing prices slide down {{slightly}} in recent months, they remain at very high level. Private housing became more and more unaffordable to Hong Kong people including the middle class. Many Hong Kong people resort to public rental housing (PRH) to meet their housing needs. As at the end of 2013, there were about 122, 200 for non-elderly one-person applicants under Quota and Points System (QPS) and that were even more than 121, 100 for general waiting list applicants. This reflects the large housing needs of young singletons for <b>one-person</b> <b>household</b> flats and alarms the public and the government of the serious shortage of housing for young singletons. The housing needs and aspirations of young singletons have ever been marginalised by the government that can be indicated by the housing policy carried out in Hong Kong. Singletons aged 21 or over have only been allowed to apply for PRH since 1985. However, the priorities of allocating PRH are given to family households, elderly and the disadvantaged. The successful housed number of non-elderly one-person applicants in permanent public rental housing increased from only 125 in 1996 / 1997 to 3, 700 in 2004 / 2005. The implementation of QPS since 2005 has greatly restricted the access of PRH by young singletons because the allocation of PRH is mainly on the basis of age and subject to the annual maximum allocation quota of 2, 000 units. On the other hand, singletons have only been allowed to apply for purchase of subsidised sale flats and home purchase loans for purchase of self-occupied flat since 1998. All these are restricted by limited quota, size of flats to be purchased and half of the loans granted to general family applicants. Following the cease of various subsidised sale schemes and home purchase loans from end of 2002, the assistance to singletons to purchase their self-occupied flats also has stopped. From the perspective of housing policy in developed countries, government interventions in the housing market have been reduced for the past few decades especially after Asian Financial Crisis and Global Financial Tsunami. Governments of western countries and developed countries of Asia have shifted to adopt more market oriented housing policy and to encourage homeownership since 1990 s. Governments emphasize provision of social rental housing to those in need. People living in social rental housing have then been stigmatized. Consequently, housing prices in these countries have been fluctuating up and down largely and supply of housing has not been matched by the needs of people. Accessibility to social rental housing by young singletons is dampened. Shortage of affordable housing affects young singletons seriously. Many young singletons tend to stay longer at parental home as what Yamada (1999) described as “parasite” single. Mckee (2012) finds that it is an international phenomenon of reducing self-occupied homeownership rates for young people as more young people staying with their parents, studying longer, having difficulty in getting employments, facing restriction on accessing state welfare benefit and in changing household formation. In acknowledging the housing needs and demands of young people, governments of Asian countries tend to adopt policy promoting self-occupied homeownership to assist young people in meeting their housing aspirations. Singapore government adopts housing policy encouraging homeownership by introducing different schemes to meet varied needs and aspirations of Singaporeans at different stages of life-cycle. In recognition of the housing aspirations and contribution of singletons, Singapore government has provided housing benefits of singletons aged 35 years or over to buy resale Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats in HDB estates and since 2013 they has been allowed to buy new flats of particular size in non-matures estates from HDB. In South Korea, the previous LEE Myung-bak administration introduced new housing policy to assist newly married couples by providing long-term self-occupied home financing with low interest rates and increasing supply of self-occupied homes for low-income newly married couples to solve the housing problems of young families. The Australian government has introduced various measures to deal with the housing affordability problem including a first self-occupied home owner savings account, a notional rental affordability scheme, national housing affordability fund and establishment of a land supply council. Many researches have found that housing pathways of young people in developed countries are similar in following a sequence that individuals move from the parental self-occupied homes through sharing accommodation, private rental housing and into self-occupied homes. Young singletons have different tenure preferences that may vary according to the educations levels, income levels, security of jobs, family backgrounds, gender, views on marriage and stages of life cycle. This paper attempts to understand the housing needs and aspirations of young singletons in Hong Kong, the reasons causing them to have different needs and aspirations and their expectations on the government in meeting their housing needs and aspiration. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were adopted to obtain the general information and views of young singleton respondents by questionnaires survey and to have better understanding of the relationship of young singleton’s backgrounds, reasons for moving out from parents, their preferences and affordability fro housing and expectations on government by in-depth interviews. The results indicate that nearly half (44 %) of young singleton respondents had no plan to buy their self-occupied flats and chose renting and only 56 % of young singleton respondents had plan to buy their self-occupied flats. To a certain extent, young singletons of Hong Kong change their housing needs and aspiration according to their stages of life-cycle. After leaving parental home, young singletons would choose sharing accommodation in private rental housing. They plan to buy their self-occupied flat when they get older or married. Factors such as age, education levels, income levels, gender, Chinese traditions, household size and present housing tenures of young singletons as well as government policy affect their housing needs and aspirations. Young singletons expect the government to provide them with more in-kind and in-cash housing subsidies in order to assist them meeting their housing needs and aspirations. published_or_final_versionHousing ManagementMasterMaster of Housing Managemen...|$|R
