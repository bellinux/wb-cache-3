5|$|Comparisons {{with the}} finds from the {{salvaged}} Mary Rose itself have {{provided an opportunity}} to compare {{the accuracy of the}} records provided in the Roll. The picture of the ship has provided clues about basic structural features, such as the number of masts and sails. When compared with an inventory of the ship from 1514, there is a close match, proving the illustration to be largely accurate. Examination <b>of</b> <b>details</b> in the construction, however, reveals that Anthony allowed himself some artistic licence. The armament in the painted ship appears clearly exaggerated. The heavy stern chasers (cannon placed in the stern aimed backwards) mounted through gun ports on the orlop deck, just about the waterline, would not have been feasible {{because of the lack of}} an orlop deck and the steep angle (sheer) of the ship in this area. The number of gunports in the broadside is inaccurate since it implies two slightly staggered rows of nine ports while the surviving starboard side of the Mary Rose has only one row of gunports on the main deck with seven ports. The accuracy of the forecastle has been more difficult to ascertain since none of it remains; conflicting interpretations of what it looked like have been suggested.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim is to}} {{investigate}} the effect of availability and level <b>of</b> <b>detail</b> <b>of</b> data on cost estimates of alcohol consumption. Using the recent Swedish cost of alcohol study as baseline, limitations on data are applied, forming two models. The costs of alcohol in Sweden are re-estimated in the two models and compared to the baseline, to establish the magnitude {{and direction of the}} bias resulting from limited data, and which results are the most sensitive to variations in data availability and level <b>of</b> <b>detail.</b> Almost all differences between the baseline and the two limited models stem from reduced availability and not the level <b>of</b> <b>detail</b> <b>of</b> data. However, the level <b>of</b> <b>detail</b> plays an important role for the prevalence of consumption and the alcohol-attributable fractions (AAFs) for injuries. The conclusion is that {{it is more important to}} estimate more cost components than to improve existing estimates, as differences between cost estimates are mainly driven by the availability rather than the level <b>of</b> <b>detail</b> <b>of</b> data. However, the level <b>of</b> <b>detail</b> in the prevalence rates of consumption and in the AAFs for injuries is likely to considerably affect the cost estimates and obtaining the best possible data in these areas should therefore be prioritized...|$|R

We evaluate the effects <b>of</b> <b>detail</b> in five case studies of wireless simulations for protocol design. Ultimately the researcher must judge what level <b>of</b> <b>detail</b> is required for a given question, but we suggest two approaches to cope with varying levels <b>of</b> <b>detail.</b> When error is not correlated, networking algorithms that are robust {{to a range of}} errors are often stressed in similar ways by random error as by detailed models.

IGN and DVD Talk felt the story was darker and flowed better in the later half than the first, but IGN felt the revelation <b>of</b> <b>details</b> came {{too late in the}} show. DVD Verdict felt the story was pointless. Despite the protagonist reaffirming himself as a protector of the city, his showdown with the antagonist reduced most of Shinjuku to ruins.

They, however, appreciated the surprising deaths of certain characters whose sacrifice in vain rendered a poignant emotion at that point of story.|$|E

However, when Cimon continued to bear down on the Persians, they accepted battle. Regardless of their numbers, the Persian battle line was quickly breached, and the Persian ships then turned about, and made for the river bank. Grounding their ships, the crews sought sanctuary with the army waiting nearby. Some ships may have been captured or destroyed during the naval battle, but it seems likely that most were able to land.|$|E

50|$|Level <b>of</b> <b>detail</b> in writing, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} level of abstraction, refers to three concepts: the precision {{in using the}} right words to form phrases, clauses and sentences; the generality of statements; and the organisational strategy in which authors arrange ideas according to a common topic in the hierarchy <b>of</b> <b>detail.</b> Placing different objects or ideas in categories {{is a type of}} classification in expert writing which allows more efficient cognitive retrieval of information by placing it in context. Maintaining appropriate level <b>of</b> <b>detail</b> in any body of text is a part of ensuring that the cognitive effort required by the reader is appropriate to the general subject of the written as a whole.
