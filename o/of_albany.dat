5|$|A view of part <b>of</b> <b>Albany,</b> New York, {{as it was}} in 1814 shows {{a mixture}} of Dutch, English and Federal styles, {{although}} Dutch brick was reportedly used for one of the English-style houses. One house in the Dutch style was said to date from the American Revolution. If so, it would {{have been one of the}} last genuine Dutch-style houses to be built in the United States, reflecting the conservative Dutch culture <b>of</b> <b>Albany</b> at that time.|$|E
5|$|Albany's {{other major}} exports during the 18th and 19th centuries were furs, wheat, meat, and lumber; by 1865, there were almost 4,000 saw mills in the Albany {{area and the}} Albany Lumber District was the largest lumber market in the nation. The city was also home {{to a number of}} banks. The Bank <b>of</b> <b>Albany</b> (1792–1861) was the second {{chartered}} bank in New York. The city was the original home of the Albank (founded in 1820 as the Albany Savings Bank), KeyBank (founded in 1825 as the Commercial Bank <b>of</b> <b>Albany),</b> and Norstar Bank (founded as the State Bank <b>of</b> <b>Albany</b> in 1803). American Express was founded in Albany in 1850 as an express mail business. In 1871, the northwestern portion of Albany—west from Magazine Street—was annexed to the neighboring town of Guilderland after the town of Watervliet refused annexation of said territory. In return for this loss, portions of Bethlehem and Watervliet were added to Albany. Part of the land annexed to Guilderland was ceded back to Albany in 1910, setting up the current western border.|$|E

5|$|The Albany Port District Commission is {{a public}} benefit {{corporation}} created {{by the state of}} New York to develop and manage port facilities anywhere in the cities <b>of</b> <b>Albany</b> and Rensselaer. The commission has five members, four of which are nominated by the mayor <b>of</b> <b>Albany</b> and one is nominated by the mayor of Rensselaer. The governor of New York then appoints them to three-year terms. The commissioners serve without pay, but are compensated for business related expenses. The commission {{is considered to be a}} unit of the city <b>of</b> <b>Albany</b> and is included in the city's financial statements. Any deficit in the finances of the commission are assessed against both Albany and Rensselaer. In 1932 the state decided that any deficit assessment would be based on Albany owing 88% of the total and Rensselaer 12%. In 2005 the commission had a staff of 35 employees: eight in administrative duties, five in maintenance, and 22 as part-time security.|$|E

5|$|The {{sole right}} to issue trading {{privileges}} anywhere in Albany County rested {{with the mayor}} and Common Council. Albany County encompassed all of Upstate New York north and west of Ulster County at that time, {{as well as the}} state of Vermont. All residents of New York, except those <b>of</b> <b>Albany,</b> were specifically banned from trading with any Iroquois nation, or with any other native tribe to the west, east, or north of the city <b>of</b> <b>Albany,</b> or with native tribes anywhere within Albany County.|$|E
5|$|After David II's death, Robert II, {{the first}} of the Stewart kings, came to the throne in 1371. He was {{followed}} in 1390 by his ailing son John, who took the regnal name Robert III. During Robert III's reign (1390–1406), actual power rested largely in the hands of his brother, Robert Stewart, Duke <b>of</b> <b>Albany.</b> After the suspicious death (possibly on the orders of the Duke <b>of</b> <b>Albany)</b> of his elder son, David, Duke of Rothesay in 1402, Robert, fearful for the safety of his younger son, the future James I, sent him to France in 1406. However, the English captured him en route and he spent the next 18 years as a prisoner held for ransom. As a result, after the death of Robert III, regents ruled Scotland: first, the Duke of Albany; and later his son Murdoch.|$|E

5|$|Along with {{commercial}} activities the Port <b>of</b> <b>Albany</b> has non-industrial uses along the river. A ship museum and a tourism cruise ship are docked at the Steamboat Square. Steamboat Square was, until 2010, named the Snow Dock for being where city trucks {{dumped into the}} Hudson River snow plowed from the streets. A PortFest was held in 2007 to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Port of Albany-Rennselaer and the 10th anniversary of the USS Slater as a museum docked at Albany.

5|$|As of 30 June 1854, {{the crew}} <b>of</b> <b>Albany</b> {{consisted}} of 18 officers, 156 seaman, and 23 Marines.

Gerry, youngest son of Elbridge Gerry, formerly Vice President of the United States, Lieutenant John Quincy Adams, grandson of the second president and nephew of the sixth, and Midshipman Bennet Israel Riley, son of Brevet General Bennet C.

5|$|During Leisler's Rebellion Jacob Leisler {{demanded the}} {{charters}} <b>of</b> <b>Albany</b> {{and the city}} of New York be forfeited, and New York yielded but Albany's mayor, Pieter Schuyler, refused. Schuyler went on {{to become one of the}} major leaders in suppressing the rebellion. The next major threat to the charter government came during the American Revolution when the Common Council stopped meeting in 1775. The local Committee of Safety took over daily functions until 1778 when the Common Council began meeting again.|$|E
5|$|In 1514, Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus (1490–1557) married James IV's widow Margaret Tudor, {{daughter}} of Henry VII, and Regent of Scotland for her infant son James V. The couple unsuccessfully conspired {{to take the}} young King to England, sparking off civil war. The Regency was handed to John Stewart, Duke <b>of</b> <b>Albany,</b> who seized Tantallon in 1515, although it was returned the following year when Angus made his peace.|$|E
5|$|In 1528, Margaret Tudor, now Regent of Scotland for {{her infant}} son James V, married Henry Stewart, 1st Lord Methven, a {{descendant}} <b>of</b> <b>Albany.</b> His brother, Sir James Stewart (c.1513–1554), was made Captain of Doune Castle, and Sir James' son, also James (c.1529–1590), was created Lord Doune in 1570. Lord Doune's son, another James (c.1565–1592), married Elizabeth Stuart, 2nd Countess of Moray around 1580, becoming Earl of Moray himself.
