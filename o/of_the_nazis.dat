5|$|In {{response}} to Hitler's reprimand, Goebbels {{launched a campaign}} to promote the antisemitic views <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> to the German populace. He ordered each film studio to make an antisemitic film. Hitler preferred films such as Der ewige Jude which presented the Nazi antisemitic agenda openly and directly; however Goebbels disliked the crudeness of such straight-forward approaches, preferring the much more subtle approach of couching antisemitic messages in an engaging story with popular appeal.|$|E
5|$|Finnish-German {{relations}} cooled {{after the}} National Socialists rose {{to power in}} 1933—Finns admired Imperial Germany, not the radical and anti-democratic Nazi regime. Finnish conservatives did not accept the state violence and anti-church policies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nazis.</b> Still, there was sympathy for German aims to revise the Treaty of Versailles, although the official Finnish policy was reserved, especially after the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. Finland even recalled its ambassador for a short period. Finnish Nazis and ultranationalist parties such as the IKL achieved only minor support in several elections, especially {{in the aftermath of}} the failed Mäntsälä rebellion in 1932.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of a world {{financial}} crisis, the King encouraged the formation of a National Government in 1931 led by MacDonald and Baldwin, and volunteered to reduce the civil list to help balance the budget. He was concerned by the rise to power in Germany of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party. In 1934, the King bluntly told the German ambassador Leopold von Hoesch that Germany was now the peril of the world, and that there was bound to be a war within ten years if she went on at the present rate; he warned the British ambassador in Berlin Eric Phipps to be suspicious <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nazis.</b>|$|E

5|$|In April 1941, the German Army invaded Yugoslavia and Greece. The LSSAH and Das Reich were {{attached}} to separate army Panzer corps. Fritz Klingenberg, a company commander in the Das Reich, led his men across Yugoslavia to the capital, Belgrade, where a small group in the vanguard accepted the surrender of the city on 13 April. A few days later Yugoslavia surrendered. SS police units immediately began taking hostages and carrying out reprisals, a practice that became common. In some cases, {{they were joined by}} the Wehrmacht. Similar to Poland, the war policies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> in the Balkans resulted in brutal occupation and racist mass murder. Serbia became the second country (after Estonia) declared Judenfrei (free of Jews).|$|E
5|$|In December 1970 Gomułka {{scored a}} major {{political}} victory when Poland obtained a West German recognition of the post-World War II borders. The German side secured the right to emigrate to West Germany for the residents of Poland of German identity and to help financially those who stayed by granting pensions: hundreds of thousands eventually became affected. German Chancellor Willy Brandt, who signed the agreement, also asked on his knees for forgiveness for the crimes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> (Warschauer Kniefall). His gesture was understood in Poland as being addressed to all Poles, although it was actually made {{at the site of}} the Warsaw Ghetto and was thus directed primarily toward the Jews. The notable reconciliation process between the Polish and German nations was initiated five years earlier, when the Polish Church issued its famous Letter of Reconciliation of the Polish Bishops to the German Bishops, criticized then by the Polish government.|$|E
5|$|In Germany, {{the use of}} {{the flag}} and other {{national}} symbols has been relatively low for most of the time since the Second World War—a reaction against the widespread use of flags by the Nazi Party and against the nationalistic furore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> in general. During the 2006 FIFA World Cup, which took place in Germany, public use of the national flag increased dramatically. Although this explosion in the flag's popularity was initially greeted by many Germans with a mixture of surprise and apprehension, the decades-old fear that German flag-waving and national pride was inextricably associated with its Nazi past was dismissed {{by the end of the}} tournament by Germans and non-Germans alike.|$|E
50|$|He {{was active}} in the Belgian {{resistance}} against <b>the</b> <b>nazis,</b> whose invasion <b>of</b> his country he predicted twelve months in advance, creating in 1939 the magazine Alert, in which he advocated <b>the</b> abandonment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Belgian neutrality for an alliance with France. He had harsh polemics with Belgian fascist Léon Degrelle. He left Belgium for the United States at the outset during World War II, supporting himself through lectures and writing, including essays such as Jazz: from the Congo to the Metropolitan, and novels set in German-occupied Belgium, including La colombe de la Gestapo ("the dove <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gestapo") and The White Brigade (published in French as Passeports pour l'Audelà).|$|R
50|$|After about 1880 he {{produced}} several elementary text-books of scientific instruction, and also various publications on educational and allied subjects. Widely used in French schools for decades {{as the basis}} for scientific education, his book La Deuxième année d'enseignement scientifique (34th edition: Armand Colin, 1896) claimed that White people were far superior and more intelligent than Black people as well as Chinese people, thus following Arthur de Gobineau's then quite popular white supremacist, aryan supremacist, unfounded theories later used by <b>the</b> <b>nazis.</b> He also actively opposed indigenous Algerian people getting any political rights in French-colonized Algeria.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to Nazi concentration camps, the Soviet gulags (labour camps) {{led to the}} death of citizens of occupied countries such as Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, as well as German prisoners of war (POWs) and even Soviet citizens who had been or were thought to be supporters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nazis.</b> Sixty per cent of Soviet POWs of the Germans died during the war. Richard Overy gives the number of 5.7 million Soviet POWs. Of those, 57 per cent died or were killed, a total of 3.6million. Soviet ex-POWs and repatriated civilians were treated with great suspicion as potential Nazi collaborators, and some of them were sent to the Gulag upon being checked by the NKVD.|$|E
5|$|Shostakovich's Symphony No. 7 {{enjoyed a}} measure of {{popularity}} throughout the Western world during the war, but from 1945 it was rarely performed outside the Soviet Union. It became a point of controversy in the 1980s after Solomon Volkov's Testimony suggested it was a critique not <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nazis,</b> but of the Soviet government. The veracity of Volkov's account, which he claims is rooted in interviews with Shostakovich, has been debated. Other issues of contention about the symphony include whether it {{was inspired by the}} attack on Leningrad (as Soviet authorities and official accounts had asserted) or planned earlier and repurposed for propaganda, as well as its artistic merit compared to Shostakovich's other works.|$|E
5|$|Soviet {{civilian}} {{populations in}} the occupied areas were severely persecuted and endured the treacherous conditions of the Eastern Front, which spawned atrocities such as the siege of Leningrad (when more than 1.2 million civilians died). Thousands of peasant villages across Russia, Belarus and Ukraine were annihilated by German troops. During the occupation the Leningrad, Pskov and Novgorod region lost {{about a quarter of}} its population. An estimated one-quarter of Soviet civilian deaths at the hands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> and their allies (five million Russians, three million Ukrainians and 1.5 million Belarusians) were racially motivated. In 1995 the Russian Academy of Sciences reported that civilian deaths in the occupied USSR, including Jews, {{at the hands of the}} Germans totaled 13.7 million dead (20 percent of the population of 68 million). The figure includes 7.4 million victims of Nazi genocide and reprisals; 2.2 million deaths of persons deported to Germany as forced labour, and 4.1 million famine and disease deaths. An estimated three million people also died of starvation in unoccupied territory. The losses occurred within the 1946–1991 borders of the USSR, and include territories annexed in 1939–40. The deaths of 8.2 million Soviet civilians, including Jews, were documented by the Soviet Extraordinary State Commission.|$|E
40|$|Abstract During our paper, we {{will try}} to {{understand}} how a fictional composition like Harry Potter can {{have anything to say about}} World War II. We will analyze <b>the</b> sixth book <b>of</b> Harry Potter: “Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince” written by J. K Rowling and we will also look into the propaganda movie “Der Ewige Jude” because of its importance for understanding how the jews were portraited during the second World War. Throughout the project, we’ll be using Ann Curthoys article about Harry Potter and the similarity that I existing between the book and <b>the</b> <b>nazis</b> under Wolrd War II. As a supplementation we will use the critical analyze made by Giselle Liza Anatol as a background knowledge on how to get Harry Potter as a important book in our generation, that has something to say about history. Third, we will be using Mikhail Luybanskys article about how to drag parallels between <b>the</b> <b>nazis</b> view on jews and the deathly hallows view on mugglers. Furthermore, we will be analyzing the entire work by using the elements from “Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince” and the ideology from “Der Ewige Jude”. We’ll support our case by analyzing <b>the</b> sixth book <b>of</b> Harry Potter by using the articles about Harry Potter to understand how something so major like World War II can be descirbed in a fantasy book made in the 21 ’th century, and is so far away from the Second World War. We want to discuss how a fantasy book can have influence on how to view World War II on a new level trough historic research...|$|R
40|$|Understandably, {{research}} has focused overwhelmingly on Jews in <b>the</b> camps <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holocaust. But <b>the</b> <b>nazis</b> had been detaining Jews in concentration camps ever since 1933, at times in large numbers. Who were these prisoners? This article analyzes nazi policies that brought Jews into the concentration camps. It ventures into the inner structure and dynamics <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most heterogeneous groups of concentration camp inmates. By contrasting the perpetrators’ objectives with the victims’ experiences, this article will illuminate <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concentration camp as <b>the</b> ultimate means <b>of</b> pressure in <b>the</b> fatal process <b>of</b> turning a minority group into an outsider group: that is, <b>the</b> act <b>of</b> defining and marking the enemy which was the critical stage before <b>the</b> destruction <b>of</b> European Jewry. Furthermore, it will examine Jewish reactions to SS terror inside the camps...|$|R
50|$|Hailed as a ‘poet of his generation’, Zber's artwork {{encapsulated}} {{all that}} was around him. Whether it was the intimate nature around him, or the diligent workers doing their trade, his artwork {{was known to be}} authentic and true to reality, {{to the point where it}} is said to be palpable. Zber's career was quickly accelerating and he was becoming increasingly renowned as a young protégée, with his reputation spreading far and wide, when <b>the</b> <b>Nazis's</b> invaded France in 1940. Sadly, Zber was captured while working in Paris and was sent to the Auschwitz extermination camp, where he was murdered in <b>the</b> prime <b>of</b> his career. Although his career was short-lived, Zber’s artwork left an indelible mark that speaks to the life and conditions of early 20th century Europe, with great historical relevance.|$|R
5|$|The {{port city}} of Memel (now Klaipėda) and the {{surrounding}} area, with a predominantly German population, was under provisional Allied control according to Article 99 of the Treaty of Versailles. The French and Polish governments favoured turning Memel into an international city, while Lithuania wanted to annex the area. By 1923, {{the fate of the}} area had still not been decided, prompting Lithuanian forces to invade in January 1923 and seize the port. After the Allies failed to reach an agreement with Lithuania, they referred the matter to the League of Nations. In December 1923, the League Council appointed a Commission of Inquiry. The commission chose to cede Memel to Lithuania and give the area autonomous rights. The Klaipėda Convention was approved by the League Council on 14 March 1924, and then by the Allied powers and Lithuania. In 1939 Germany retook the region following the rise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> and an ultimatum to Lithuania, demanding the return of the region under threat of war. The League of Nations failed to prevent the secession of the Memel region to Germany.|$|E
5|$|To {{celebrate}} Hitler's {{appointment as}} chancellor, Goebbels organized a torchlit parade in Berlin {{on the night}} of 30 January of an estimated 60,000 men, many in the uniforms of the SA and SS. The spectacle was covered by a live state radio broadcast, with commentary by longtime party member and future Minister of Aviation Hermann Göring. Goebbels was disappointed to not be given a post in Hitler's new cabinet. Bernhard Rust was appointed as Minister of Culture, the post Goebbels was expecting to receive. Like other NSDAP officials, Goebbels had to deal with Hitler's leadership style of giving contradictory orders to his subordinates, while placing them into positions where their duties and responsibilities overlapped. In this way, Hitler fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power. The NSDAP took advantage of the Reichstag fire of 27 February 1933, with Hindenburg passing the Reichstag Fire Decree the following day at Hitler's urging. This was the first of several pieces of legislation that dismantled democracy in Germany and put a totalitarian dictatorship—headed by Hitler—in its place. On 5 March, yet another Reichstag election took place, the last to be held before the defeat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> {{at the end of the}} Second World War. While the NSDAP increased their number of seats and percentage of the vote, it was not the landslide expected by the party leadership. Goebbels finally received Hitler's appointment to the cabinet, officially becoming head of the newly created Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda on 14 March.|$|E

50|$|At <b>the</b> age <b>of</b> 29, {{after several}} {{jobs in the}} Russian {{ceramics}} industry—inspecting factories in the Ukraine as well as designing for the Lomonosov and Dulevo factories—Zeisel was named artistic director <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet china and glass industry. On May 26, 1936, while living in Moscow, Zeisel was arrested. She had been falsely accused of participating in an assassination plot against Joseph Stalin. She was held in prison for 16 months, 12 of which were spent in solitary confinement. In September 1937, Zeisel was expelled and deported to Vienna, Austria. Some of her prison experiences {{form the basis for}} Darkness at Noon, the well known anti-Stalinist novel written by a childhood friend, Arthur Koestler. It was while in Vienna that Zeisel re-established contact with her future husband Hans Zeisel, later a noted legal scholar, statistician, and professor at <b>The</b> University <b>of</b> Chicago. A few months after her arrival in Vienna <b>the</b> <b>nazis</b> invaded, and Eva took the last train out. She and Hans met up in England where they married and sailed for the U.S. with $67 between them.|$|R
25|$|The comic is set during World War II, and {{the protagonist}} - Ernie Pike - is the narrator, without playing {{an active role}} in the stories. Unlike genre standards, the comic does not show any battles, and neither {{describes}} the war between Allies and Nazis as a conflict between good and evil. Instead, it centers on tragic events involving soldiers of both sides. Generally, those tragedies are misunderstandings that end up badly: characters who go mad, kill their own friends by friendly fire or because they believe them to be traitors, attempt to get killed in a specific way to avoid a more gruesome death, or who must mercy-kill badly hurt comrades, to cite several examples. Oesterheld, thus, utilizes war comics to reflect his personal dislike <b>of</b> war itself. <b>The</b> character never formulates positive or negative opinions about <b>the</b> allies, <b>the</b> <b>nazis</b> or specific events <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, but about <b>the</b> morality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soldiers in the anecdotes narrated. The stories take place at multiple locations of World War II, such as the European Theatre, the South Pacific ocean, the North African Campaign and the Eastern Front.|$|R
50|$|From 1939, {{having lost}} <b>the</b> war, many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> combatants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> party were {{executed}} or died in exile.

Those who stayed free joined the French Resistance and had worked intensely to help allied airmen and Jews to escape from occupied France and against <b>the</b> regime <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spanish general Franco up to his death.|$|R

40|$|The {{works that}} {{constitute}} <b>the</b> submission <b>of</b> this PhD are {{broken down into}} the recording series for London/Decca: “Entartete Musik” and the book FORBIDDEN MUSIC – THE JEWISH COMPOSERS BANNED BY <b>THE</b> <b>NAZIS</b> (henceforth: Forbidden Music). Adjacent and central {{as a means of}} research was a period of eight years spent as Music Curator at Vienna’s Jewish Museum from 2002 – 10. This essay begins with an introduction in which I lay out the unique ground covered by both the recording series and Forbidden Music. This is followed by Part I: an exposition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> methodology behind both the recording series and the book. Part II <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis offers subjective reflections on the historic and cultural environment that motivated both the book and the recordings, while Part III constitutes a series of reflections on my recovery of music lost or suppressed after 1933; a recovery that started over {{a quarter of a century}} ago and continues to raise issues that demand attention. All three sections address the means by which restitution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> musical legacy lost after 1933 may be conceived, mapped out and implemented by musicians and scholars; they may hopefully provide a reference for <b>the</b> restitution <b>of</b> interrupted and truncated cultural narratives in the future...|$|R
