40|$|In {{multiprocessor}} systems, redundant scheduling is {{a technique}} that trades processing power for increased reliability. One approach, called primary-backup task scheduling, is often used in real-time multiprocessor systems to ensure that deadlines are met in spite of faults. Briefly, it consists in scheduling a secondary task conditionally, {{in such a way}} that the secondary task actually gets executed only if the primary task (or the processor executing it) fails to terminate properly. Doing so avoids wasting CPU resources in the failure- free case, but primary and secondary tasks must then compete for resources in case of failure. To overcome this, <b>overloading</b> strategies, such as primary and backup <b>overloading</b> (PB) and backup-backup <b>overloading</b> (BB), aim at improving schedulability while retaining a certain level of reliability. In this paper, we propose a hybrid <b>overloading</b> technique based on extended PB <b>overloading,</b> which combines advantages of both PB and BB <b>overloading.</b> The three <b>overloading</b> strategies are then compared through a stochastic analysis, and by simulating them under diverse system conditions.

The study was intended to discover the relationship, if any, between <b>Overloaded</b> Adults' load and their Readiness, the reasons <b>Overloaded</b> Adults do not participate in particular educational activities, the percentages of <b>Overloaded</b> Adults in a range from "able and willing" to "neither able nor willing" to participate in various educational activities, the power sources <b>Overloaded</b> Adults identify as present or not present, and how <b>Overloaded</b> Adults' demographic characteristics relate to their load and Readiness. The sample in the study consisted of 60 <b>Overloaded</b> Adults. The researcher used a convenience sampling of available passersby walking on downtown sidewalks in four Indiana cities who were willing to stop and complete the written survey, which consisted of two parts: the Type E Stress Inventory developed by Harriet B. Braiker and a questionnaire developed by the researcher. The researcher also conducted 21 tape-recorded telephone interviews. The researcher analyzed the data using the Pearson correlation coefficient statistic and a scatter plot, tallies and percentages, observations, and interview responses incorporated into a profile and description of general themes. The researcher discovered that the majority of adults (77 %) walking on downtown sidewalks on Saturdays were <b>Overloaded</b> Adults. Further, the researcher found, unlike McClusky's theory of margin, that there was likely no relationship between <b>Overloaded</b> Adults' load and Readiness and that <b>Overloaded</b> Adults with a surplus of power over load were not necessarily more likely to learn than <b>Overloaded</b> Adults with a surplus of load over power. The researcher also found 1) at least 30 inhibiting conditions or situations that shaped <b>Overloaded</b> Adults' perceptions of their readiness to learn, 2) <b>Overloaded</b> Adults were very willing and somewhat able to participate in various educational activities, 3) <b>Overloaded</b> Adults had numerous available sources of power, and 4) <b>Overloaded</b> Adults with particular demographic characteristics were at high risk for not being ready to learn.

(b) Automatic type casts between different data types is performed using <b>overloaded</b> constructor functions. Again this reduces the number of over-loaded functions.
