500|$|The song's {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Anthony Mandler, and shot on an indoor soundstage in Castaic, California on April 23, 2008. The concept for the video was [...] "high-end erotica". In an interview with James Montgomery for MTV News whilst on set of the music video, Levine provided a summary of what the video would entail, saying: [...] "It's this kind of ultra-glamorous, photography-based, late-'70s/ early-'80s situation. It's really stylish and really beautiful... It's the most choreographed thing I've ever done, because usually I just {{get up there and}} screw around. But with Rihanna, it's completely different and so cool." [...] In response, Rihanna continued to say that [...] "I don't do a lot of videos where I have so much chemistry with the other artist, and this is <b>only</b> <b>my</b> second duet in a video... It's really intense, because you have to work with each other so much. It's new for me, but I'm enjoying it." ...|$|E
500|$|Markham {{had agreed}} to Shackleton's {{appointment}} as Third Officer on the Discovery following a recommendation from the expedition's principal private donor. He had given sympathy and support after Shackleton's early return from the expedition on grounds of ill health, and had backed the latter's unsuccessful application for a Royal Navy commission. Later, after Shackleton had confided his intention to lead an expedition of his own, Markham supplied a generous testimonial, describing Shackleton as [...] "well-fitted to have charge of men in an enterprise involving hardship and peril", and [...] "admirably fitted for {{the leader of a}} Polar Expedition." [...] He expressed strong support for Shackleton's 1907–09 Nimrod Expedition: [...] "... not <b>only</b> <b>my</b> most cordial wishes for your success will accompany you, but also a well-founded hope." [...] When news of the expedition's achievement of a new Farthest South latitude of 88°23' reached him, Markham publicly signified his intention to propose Shackleton for the RGS Patron's Medal.|$|E
500|$|On April 3, 1989, as the Gores {{and their}} six-year-old son Albert were leaving a {{baseball}} game, Albert {{ran across the}} street to see his friend and was hit by a car. He was thrown , and then traveled along the pavement for another [...] Gore later recalled: [...] "I ran to his side and held him and called his name, but he was motionless, limp and still, without breath or pulse. His eyes were open with the nothingness stare of death, and we prayed, the two of us, there in the gutter, with <b>only</b> <b>my</b> voice." [...] Albert was tended to by two nurses who happened to be present during the accident. The Gores spent the next month in the hospital with Albert. Gore also commented: [...] "Our lives were consumed with the struggle to restore his body and spirit." [...] This event was [...] "a trauma so shattering that [...] views it as a moment of personal rebirth", a [...] "key moment in his life" [...] which [...] "changed everything." ...|$|E

500|$|On 8 June 2007, Alonso {{signed a}} five-year contract, stating, [...] "I {{knew there was}} {{interest}} from other clubs {{but it was always}} my idea to stay here. I have been here for three seasons now and have such special feelings for the club and the supporters. I understand what Liverpool means to so many people. It is such a special club and I just didn't want to leave." [...] The 2007–08 season started well for the Spaniard: Gerrard's absence led to Alonso playing in a more advanced position and he scored twice in a 6–0 rout against Premier League newcomers Derby County. The bright beginning was short-lived, however, as a minor injury sustained in a game against Portsmouth became aggravated in training. The metatarsal injury forced him out of training for six weeks but his return to the first team was rushed and his injury recurred in his first game back. Alonso's determination and passion proved to be his downfall, and he later reflected, [...] "I had been feeling a bit tired around that time because it was <b>only</b> <b>my</b> first game back and the match was very fast. But as a player you don't want to come off, particularly when the team is winning and I stayed on." ...|$|E
500|$|On Janet, Jackson began {{focusing}} on sexual themes. Shayne Lee, author of Erotic Revolutionaries: Black Women, Sexuality, and Popular Culture (2010), wrote that her music {{over the following}} decade [...] "brand her {{as one of the}} most sexually stimulating vocalists of the 1990s." [...] In You've Come A Long Way, Baby: Women, Politics, and Popular Culture (1996), Lilly J. Goren observed [...] "Jackson's evolution from politically aware musician to sexy diva marked the direction that society and the music industry were encouraging the dance-rock divas to pursue." [...] The Washington Post declared Jackson's public image over the course of her career had shifted [...] "from innocence to experience, inspiring such carnal albums as 1993's 'Janet' and 1997's 'The Velvet Rope', the latter of which explored the bonds—figuratively and literally—of love and lust." [...] The song [...] "Free Xone" [...] from The Velvet Rope, which portrays same-sex relationships in a positive light, is described by sociologist Shayne Lee as [...] "a rare incident in which a popular black vocalist explores romantic or sensual energy outside the contours of heteronormativity, making it a significant song in black sexual politics." [...] During promotion for Janet, she stated [...] "I love feeling deeply sexual—and don't mind letting the world know. For me, sex has become a celebration, a joyful part of the creative process." [...] Upon the release of Damita Jo, Jackon stated [...] "Beginning with the earlier albums, exploring—and liberating—my sexuality has been an ongoing discovery and theme," [...] adding [...] "As an artist, that's not <b>only</b> <b>my</b> passion, it's my obligation." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine has found Jackson's consistent inclusion of sex in her music lacking ingenuity, especially in comparisons to other artists such as Prince, stating [...] "while sex indisputably fuels much great pop music, it isn't an inherently fascinating topic for pop music—as with anything, it all depends on the artist." ...|$|E
