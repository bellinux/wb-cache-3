25|$|There {{are several}} {{possible}} explanations for the bat; one is that bats are simply quite common in the area. The second theory is that on 9 October 1238, when James I was {{about to enter the}} city, re-conquering it from the Moors, a bat landed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> flag, and he interpreted it as a good sign.

25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1943 Hughes spent nearly a month in Las Vegas, test flying his Sikorsky S-43 {{amphibian}} aircraft, practicing touch-and-go landings on Lake Mead in preparation for flying the H-4 Hercules. The weather conditions at the lake during the day were ideal and he enjoyed Las Vegas at night. On May 17, 1943, Hughes flew the Sikorsky from California carrying two CAA aviation inspectors, two of his employees, and actress Ava Gardner. Hughes dropped Gardner off in Las Vegas and proceeded to Lake Mead to conduct qualifying tests in the S-43. The test flight did not go well. The Sikorsky crashed into Lake Mead, killing CAA inspector Ceco Cline and Hughes employee Richard Felt. Hughes suffered a severe gash <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> head when he hit the upper control panel {{and had to be}} rescued by one of the others on board. Hughes paid divers $100,000 to raise the aircraft and later spent more than $500,000 restoring it.|$|E
500|$|When {{portrayed as}} a secret agent, Povenmire starts with a similar bread loaf square design, but draws it {{standing}} up vertically and places a fedora <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> head, which is combined with the square torso. In contrast to his mindless and wild-eyed expression as a pet, the secret agent version of Perry is detailed with eyes [...] "full of steely blue resolve." [...] Povenmire proceeds by drawing his arms, with bare hands that are open and prepared for fighting or any danger. His legs are bent, as well prepared for an act of danger or action needed. Povenmire finishes the design by adding his beaver tail and color.|$|E
500|$|All {{characters}} in Phineas and Ferb were drawn in a design borrowed from Tex Avery's style, with geometric shapes being included in their structure; Phineas {{in particular is}} that of a triangle. The triangle face has been stated in the series as being just his nose that covers the entire head. The goal while drawing characters was to make them simple enough to be drawn by child viewers and be recognized by silhouette. Phineas's eyes lie <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> head and are of oval shape. For his hair, three [...] "tufts" [...] are put in the back and front, while three freckles lie underneath. For the ear, a small 3 is used to represent the ear lobe. Povenmire uses thin, spindly arms for every character as a simple reason to add fun.|$|E

2500|$|Conversely the England leg-spinner Doug Wright was {{considered}} to be the unluckiest bowler in the world; [...] "He continually rapped the pads with his straight one, and when the decision went against him, his face clouded with puzzled dismay."

2500|$|At SummerSlam in August, Hart was {{to defend}} his Intercontinental Championship against Austin in a [...] "Kiss My Ass" [...] match, where Hart put the title up against Austin having to kiss his {{buttocks}} if he lost.

Hart was then entered into a tournament to crown a new champion.|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} was mostly very well received by media {{for a variety}} of reasons.

[...] She was the first [...] "gaming crush" [...] of GamesRadar's David Meikleham, who commented: [...] "This mangled mess of fugly 32-bit polygons and even fuglier textures was the equivalent of sex on a CD back in 1999. Sexy, sassy and with a strength that reminded me of Ellen Ripley, Meryl was a true pioneer for strong female gaming characters in a time when Lara Croft was a role model for lower back pain." [...] Similarly, Wesley Yin-Poole of VideoGamer.com placed her <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> 2010 list of [...] "video game crushes".
