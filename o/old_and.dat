50|$|Old English, Old Frisian, <b>Old</b> Saxon <b>and</b> <b>Old</b> Dutch {{share the}} {{application}} of the Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law, which extensively influenced the first two languages. The latter two were only partially affected, and a dialect continuum persisted between them that was only recently interrupted by the simultaneous dissemination of standard languages within each nation and the decline of local dialects. Despite sharing some particular features, a number of disparities separate Old Saxon, <b>Old</b> English, <b>and</b> <b>Old</b> Dutch; one such difference is the Old Dutch use of -a as its plural a-stem noun ending, while <b>Old</b> Saxon <b>and</b> <b>Old</b> English employ -as or -os. Much of the grammatical variation between <b>Old</b> Dutch <b>and</b> <b>Old</b> Saxon is similar to that between <b>Old</b> Dutch <b>and</b> <b>Old</b> High German.|$|R
50|$|Ageism has {{significant}} {{effects on the}} elderly and young people. The stereotypes <b>and</b> infantilization of <b>older</b> <b>and</b> younger people by patronizing language affects <b>older</b> <b>and</b> younger people's self-esteem and behaviors. After repeatedly hearing a stereotype that older or younger people are useless, <b>older</b> <b>and</b> younger people may begin to feel like dependent, non-contributing members of society. They may start to perceive themselves {{in terms of the}} looking-glass self—that is, in the same ways that others in society see them. Studies have also specifically shown that when <b>older</b> <b>and</b> younger people hear these stereotypes about their supposed incompetence and uselessness, they perform worse on measures of competence and memory. These stereotypes then become self-fulfilling prophecies. According to Becca Levy's Stereotype Embodiment Theory, <b>older</b> <b>and</b> younger people might also engage in self-stereotypes, taking their culture's age stereotypes—to which they have been exposed over the life course—and directing them inward toward themselves. Then this behavior reinforces the present stereotypes and treatment of the elderly.|$|R

The initiative also maintains a temporary exception for already existing marriages of 14 <b>and</b> 15 year <b>olds,</b> but forbids new marriages like these in the future.|$|R

Although Minas Geraes had been further refitted from 1939 to 1943, the ship was still too <b>old</b> <b>and</b> in too poor a condition for any {{active role in the}} Second World War; instead, the dreadnought was anchored as a floating battery in the port of Salvador {{for the duration of the}} war.|$|E

5|$|Breckinridge {{was equally}} {{controversial}} in internal church politics. He rebuked the Synod of the Western Reserve for de-emphasizing and effectively abandoning {{the office of}} Ruling Elder. He also condemned the governance of Presbyterian missionaries by anyone other than the Presbyterian church. In 1834, he was the chief author of the Act and Testimony, a document summarizing the contentions between the <b>Old</b> <b>and</b> New Schools. The New School resented Breckinridge and those who signed the Act and Testimony, and even some in the Old School camp had hoped for a more moderate course. The differences between the <b>Old</b> <b>and</b> New Schools widened over the teachings of Albert Barnes, and the New School members were ejected from the Presbyterian Church in 1837. Because of his leadership in the Old School-New School controversy, Breckinridge was elected moderator of the Old School branch's General Assembly in 1841.|$|E
