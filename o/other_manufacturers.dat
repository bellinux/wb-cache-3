5|$|Dugan {{licensed}} {{this more}} practical system to Altec who produced 4- and 8-channel automixers for commercial installations such as hotels, conference rooms, courtrooms and city council chambers. The Dugan Speech System {{was the first}} commercially successful automixing algorithm. Over the next 15 years, <b>other</b> <b>manufacturers</b> designed competing automixers, and the market segment was born.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 Coca-Cola began a {{collaboration}} with Emeco {{to create a}} 1006-based chair made out of recycled Coca-Cola bottles, which was released in 2010. Metropolis Magazine {{said it was a}} public relations effort by Coke to make a durable product out of their bottles; they also hoped to encourage <b>other</b> <b>manufacturers</b> to do the same.|$|E

50|$|The {{company makes}} its own sails and wings, and {{supplies}} more wings to other North American trike manufacturers, such as Wettrike, than any <b>other</b> <b>manufacturer.</b>|$|R
5|$|The company {{initially}} had various factories for vehicle production around France (mainly at the Paris area) {{which came}} from its predecessors and Chausson, but it soon centred assembly on Blainville-sur-Orne (trucks) and Annonay (buses and coaches). Saviem formed partnerships with <b>other</b> <b>manufacturers,</b> leading to technology-sharing agreements.|$|E
5|$|Tri-ang, {{and later}} Hornby, have {{produced}} 'OO'-scale models of Flying Scotsman almost continuously since the 1960s. In the 2000s, Hornby also produced live steam examples, re-using the chassis {{from the initial}} LNER Class A4 models. <b>Other</b> <b>manufacturers</b> have produced models in other scales, such as Minitrix (N-gauge) and Bassett-Lowke (O-gauge).|$|E
5|$|A notable {{feature of}} Bolliger & Mabillard roller {{coasters}} is the box-section track. The running rails {{are connected to}} a box-section spine, instead of the circular spine used by <b>other</b> <b>manufacturers.</b> When a train travels around a box-section track, it creates a distinctive roaring sound, which is unique to this style of track. However, on some Bolliger & Mabillard roller coasters, such as Talon at Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom, and Gatekeeper at Cedar Point the track is filled with sand to reduce this noise.|$|E

50|$|These {{devices were}} created under {{contract}} {{for a single}} non-carrier manufacturer and not branded by HTC, any carriers, or any <b>other</b> <b>manufacturer.</b> For this reason, none of them feature any custom HTC UI.|$|R
5|$|After the {{announcement}} of the device, a lack of supply was evident. This was due to a shortage of components such as the screen. Reports emerged, stating that Sharp was unable to ship the screen before the debut of the iPhone 5, and <b>other</b> <b>manufacturers</b> reported that it was difficult to keep up with demand. As a result, the number of pre-orders rose due to the uncertainty of stock at retail stores, and the delivery dates for pre-orders were postponed to dates that were after the initial release date of the device.|$|E
5|$|Dugan's {{original}} 1974 patent {{expired in}} 1991, and the Dugan Speech System patent in 1993. <b>Other</b> <b>manufacturers</b> began to sell automixers incorporating the Dugan algorithm. In 1996, Dugan produced the Model D-1, an automixer for speech-only applications. The Model D-2 returned to having applicability for both speech and music, {{as did the}} Model D-3. In 1997, Dugan licensed his system to Protech Audio of Indian Lake, New York, yielding the Protech 2000 model series.|$|E

5|$|Halos {{commercial}} and critical success {{has led to}} large amounts of merchandise featuring the franchise's characters to be produced. The Master Chief, the most visible symbol of the series, has been heavily marketed, with the character's visage appearing on soda bottles, T-shirts, and Xbox controllers. Other merchandise produced includes several sets of action figures, produced by Joyride Studios and McFarlane Toys among <b>other</b> <b>manufacturers.</b> Halos characters have received varying reception, with characters such as the Chief, Cortana, and the Arbiter well received by critics.|$|E
5|$|European {{companies}} which bought foreign patents the Wrights {{had received}} sued <b>other</b> <b>manufacturers</b> in their countries. Those lawsuits were only partly successful. Despite a pro-Wright ruling in France, legal maneuvering dragged {{on until the}} patent expired in 1917. A German court ruled the patent not valid because of prior disclosure in speeches by Wilbur Wright in 1901 and Chanute in 1903. In the U.S. the Wrights made {{an agreement with the}} Aero Club of America to license airshows which the Club approved, freeing participating pilots from a legal threat. Promoters of approved shows paid fees to the Wrights.|$|E
5|$|The company {{introduced}} an appetizer cat food, Fancy Feast Appetizers, in 2009. A Purina Pro Plan line for senior dogs {{was introduced in}} 2010. It contains medium chain triglycerides (MCTs) for brain function and has whole grains for digestion. A grain-free product, Purina ONE Beyond, was introduced in 2011. Purina Pro Plan Sport, which contains extra fat and protein and is intended for athletic dogs, was made available in 2013. In 2014 Purina introduced a product for the growing Brazilian market called Ravena, which used locally available ingredients, such as acerola and jabuticaba fruits. Purina-branded accessories, such as training pads, beds, leashes and cleaners began being sold in 2011 under the Purina PetGear name through brand licensing agreements with <b>other</b> <b>manufacturers.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Thiolyte brand {{range of}} {{materials}} are manufactured under license {{from the company}} Insulectric in South Africa by Isolants Victor Hallet in Belgium and Isolants Hallet Shanghai in China. No <b>other</b> <b>manufacturer</b> is licensed to manufacture Thiolyte.|$|R
5000|$|While {{these systems}} {{were similar to}} <b>other</b> <b>manufacturer's</b> minicomputers, IBM {{themselves}} described the System/32, System/34 and System/36 as [...] "small systems" [...] and later as [...] "midrange" [...] computers along with the System/38 and succeeding AS/400 range.|$|R
25|$|The European Car of the Year award, Europe's premier {{automotive}} trophy for {{the past}} 50 years, has been awarded twelve times to the Fiat Group, more than any <b>other</b> <b>manufacturer,</b> most recently with the Fiat 500 in 2008.|$|R
5|$|In the 1990s, most {{applications}} {{that do not}} depend on thorium's radioactivity declined quickly due to safety and environmental concerns as suitable safer replacements were found. Despite its radioactivity, the element has remained in use for applications where no suitable alternatives could be found. A 1981 study by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States estimated that using a thorium mantle every weekend would be safe for a person, {{but this was not}} the case for the dose received by people manufacturing the mantles (and thus contacting many) or for the soils around some factory sites. Some manufacturers have changed to other materials, such as yttrium, although these are usually either more expensive or less efficient. <b>Other</b> <b>manufacturers</b> continued to make thorium mantles, but moved their factories to developing countries. As recently as 2007, some companies continued to manufacture and sell thorium mantles without giving adequate information about their radioactivity, with some claiming them to be non-radioactive while using quantities of thorium of up to 259milligrams per mantle.|$|E
5|$|The airline has {{operated}} over 700 aircraft throughout its history. It was a loyal customer of Douglas Aircraft Company and its successor McDonnell Douglas, operating 290 aircraft and all major models from the DC-3 through the MD-90, except the MD-11. Boeing is the second-largest manufacturer with 127 aircraft, of which 105 were 737s. <b>Other</b> <b>manufacturers</b> have been Fokker (51 aircraft), Bombardier (40), Airbus (29), Convair (22), Sud Aviation (21), Saab (14), Vickers (9), ATR (6), British Aerospace (3), British Aircraft Corporation (2), Junkers (2) and Shorts (2). SAS {{has been the}} launch customer of the Saab Scandia, the Sud Aviation Caravelle, the McDonnell Douglas DC-9-20 and −40 and the Boeing 737–600. SAS was the sole customer of the DC-9-20; the DC-9-40 served SAS for 34 years—longer than any other model. Fourteen aircraft {{have been involved in}} hull-loss accidents, four of which were fatal.|$|E
5|$|Despite taking massive {{losses on}} the Saturn, {{including}} a 75 {{percent drop in}} half-year profits just before the Japanese launch of the Dreamcast, Sega felt confident about its new system. The Dreamcast attracted significant interest and drew many pre-orders. Sega announced that Sonic Adventure, the next game starring company mascot Sonic the Hedgehog, would arrive {{in time for the}} Dreamcast's launch and promoted the game with a large-scale public demonstration at the Tokyo Kokusai Forum Hall.s Tokyo premiere was a grand event–three stadium-packed showings, a demonstration of the game and more... Afterward, Segata Sanshiro led the crowd in a Sonic chant, which will be used in the game.}} However, Sega could not achieve its shipping goals for the Dreamcast's Japanese launch due to a shortage of PowerVR chipsets caused by a high failure rate in the manufacturing process. As more than half of its limited stock had been pre-ordered, Sega stopped pre-orders in Japan. On November 27, 1998, the Dreamcast launched in Japan at a price of JP¥29,000, and the entire stock sold out {{by the end of the}} day. However, of the four games available at launch, only one—a port of Virtua Fighter 3, the most successful arcade game Sega ever released in Japan—sold well. Sega estimated that an additional 200,000-300,000 Dreamcast units could have been sold with sufficient supply. Key Dreamcast software titles Sonic Adventure and Sega Rally Championship 2, which had been delayed, arrived within the following weeks, but sales continued to be slower than expected. Irimajiri hoped to sell over 1 million Dreamcast units in Japan by February 1999, but less than 900,000 were sold, undermining Sega's attempts to build up a sufficient installed base to ensure the Dreamcast's survival after the arrival of competition from <b>other</b> <b>manufacturers.</b> There were reports of disappointed Japanese consumers returning their Dreamcasts and using the refund to purchase additional PlayStation software. Seaman, released in July 1999, was considered the Dreamcast's first major hit in Japan. Prior to the Western launch, Sega reduced the price of the Dreamcast to JP¥19,900, effectively making the hardware unprofitable but increasing sales. The price reduction and release of Namco's Soul Calibur helped Sega to gain 17 percent on its shares.|$|E
