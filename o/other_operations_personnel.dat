5000|$|Triple Canopy, Inc., is {{a private}} {{security}} company that provides integrated security, mission support and risk management services to corporate, government and non-profit clients. The firm was founded in May 2003 by veteran U.S. Army Special Forces Soldiers, including former Delta Operators. In June 2014 the firm merged with rival security contracting firm, Academi, formerly Blackwater, thus forming the new company Constellis Group. The new CEO of Constellis Group is the former CEO of Academi, Craig Nixon, and training facilities are to be consolidated at the existing Academi training facility in North Carolina. [...] It was staffed by, among others, a number of former Army Special <b>Operations</b> <b>personnel,</b> Special Forces Soldiers, Rangers, SEALs, MARSOC Critical Skills Operators, <b>other</b> special <b>operations</b> <b>personnel,</b> and a select few law enforcement officers. Over 5,000 employees worked for Triple Canopy {{at the time of}} the merger.|$|R
5000|$|After {{a grueling}} schedule, caused {{in part by}} the cost of the band's {{unwieldy}} [...] "Wall of Sound" [...] public address system, {{the decision was made to}} stop touring and performing as the Grateful Dead, short of actually disbanding. Averaging over 600 speakers powered by a minimum of 48 600-watt amplifiers, the massive and experimental sound reinforcement system had advanced the technology but also presented an array of physical, audio and technical difficulties. It had required four semi-trailer trucks to transport and, due to the rigging time, necessitated two, leapfrogging road crews with separate scaffolding sets.

500|$|On April 1, 1931, Goodman was {{promoted}} by Chief Scout Executive James E. West to become national program {{director of the}} BSA, {{as part of an}} organizational restructuring. Goodman was one of four division directors reporting to West (the <b>other</b> divisions were <b>operations,</b> <b>personnel,</b> and business). As national program director, he was responsible for professional and volunteer training, relations with sponsoring organizations, public relations, and program development. The Cub Scouting and Exploring programs were established under his leadership. He greatly expanded BSA training programs for adult leaders, establishing the BSA's highly regarded national training center at Schiff Scout Reservation in New Jersey in 1932 and, later, the training program at Philmont Scout Ranch, beginning in 1938. He also oversaw the publication of the Boy Scout Handbook, edited by his good friend and colleague William [...] "Green Bar Bill" [...] Hillcourt, as well as the Handbook for Scoutmasters and the first edition of the widely read Scout Field Book. Goodman also wrote the Leader's Handbook, a key instructional guide for Scout leaders.|$|R
50|$|The targets may be {{personnel}} or high-value materiel (military {{equipment and}} weapons) but most often they target {{the most important}} enemy personnel such as officers or specialists (e.g. communications operators) so as to cause maximum disruption to enemy <b>operations.</b> <b>Other</b> <b>personnel</b> they might target include those who pose an immediate threat to the sniper, like dog handlers, who are often employed {{in a search for}} snipers. A sniper identifies officers by their appearance and behavior such as symbols of rank, talking to radio operators, sitting as a passenger in a car, sitting in a car with a large radio antenna, having military servants, binoculars/map cases or talking and moving position more frequently. If possible, snipers shoot in descending order by rank, or if rank is unavailable, they shoot to disrupt communications.|$|R

5000|$|The {{origin of}} the double tap {{technique}} is credited to William Ewart Fairbairn and Eric A. Sykes, British police chiefs working in Shanghai during the 1930s who developed the technique in order to overcome the limitations of full metal jacketed (FMJ) ammunition. FMJ ammunition is commonly used by militaries for feeding reliability, adherence to the Hague Conventions regarding non-expanding ammunition, and improved penetration. FMJ rounds can fail to cause sufficient damage, requiring more hits and better shot placement. In Ian Dearâ€™s book Sabotage and Subversion about British Special Operations Executive (SOE) and United States Office of Strategic Services (OSS) forces, Fairbairn {{is reported to have}} instructed SOE personnel in the double tap from 1944 to 1945 at the SOE training school directed by Fairbairn and Sykes near Arisaig in Scotland. The term [...] "double tap" [...] is now used to describe the broader technique of firing two rounds quickly and accurately to disable an opponent. The tactic is still used today by firearms handlers, police tactical teams, military personnel, counter-terrorist combat units, and <b>other</b> Special <b>Operations</b> Forces <b>personnel.</b>|$|R

40|$|The Large Hadron Collider at CERN {{restarted}} in 2015 with {{a higher}} centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The instantaneous luminosity {{is expected to increase}} significantly in the coming years. An upgraded Level- 1 trigger system is being deployed in the CMS experiment {{in order to maintain the}} same efficiencies for searches and precision measurements as those achieved in the previous run. This system must be controlled and monitored coherently through software, with high operational efficiency. The legacy system is composed of approximately 4000 data processor boards, of several custom application-specific designs. These boards are organised into several subsystems; each subsystem receives data from different detector systems (calorimeters, barrel/endcap muon detectors), or with differing granularity. These boards have been controlled and monitored by a medium-sized distributed system of over 40 computers and 200 processes. Only a small fraction of the control and monitoring software was common between the different subsystems; the configuration data was stored in a database, with a different schema for each subsystem. This large proportion of subsystem-specific software resulted in high long-term maintenance costs, and a high risk of losing critical knowledge through the turnover of software developers in the Level- 1 trigger project. The upgraded system is composed of a set of general purpose boards, that follow the MicroTCA specification, and transmit data over optical links, resulting in a more homogeneous system. This system will contain the order of 100 boards connected by 3000 optical links, which must be controlled and monitored coherently. The associated software is based on generic C++ classes corresponding to the firmware blocks that are shared across different cards, regardless of the role that the card plays in the system. A common database schema will also be used to describe the hardware composition and configuration data. Whilst providing a generic description of the upgrade hardware, its monitoring data, and control interface, this software framework (SWATCH) must also have the flexibility to allow each subsystem to specify different configuration sequences and monitoring data depending on its role. By increasing the proportion of common software, the upgrade systems software will require less manpower for development and maintenance. By defining a generic hardware description of significantly finer granularity, the SWATCH framework will be able to provide a more uniform graphical interface across the different subsystems compared with the legacy system, simplifying the training of the shift crew, on-call experts, and <b>other</b> <b>operation</b> <b>personnel.</b> We present here, the design of the control software for the upgrade Level- 1 Trigger, and experience from using this software to commission the upgraded system. The Large Hadron Collider at CERN restarted in 2015 with a 13 TeV centre-of-mass energy. In addition, the instantaneous luminosity is expected to increase significantly in the coming years. In order to maintain the same efficiencies for searches and precision measurements as those achieved in the previous run, the CMS experiment upgraded the Level- 1 trigger system. The new system consists of the order of 100 electronics boards connected by approximately 3000 optical links, which must be controlled and monitored coherently through software, with high operational efficiency.
