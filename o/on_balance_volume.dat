30|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the profitability of}} technical trading rules in the five Southeast Asian stock markets. The data cover a period of 14  years from January 2000 to December 2013. The instruments investigated are five Southeast Asian stock market indices: SET index (Thailand), FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLC index (Malaysia), FTSE Straits Times index (Singapore), JSX Composite index (Indonesia), and PSE composite index (the Philippines). Trading strategies investigated include Relative Strength Index, Stochastic oscillator, Moving Average Convergence-Divergence, Directional Movement Indicator and <b>On</b> <b>Balance</b> <b>Volume.</b> Performances are compared to a simple Buy-and-Hold. Statistical tests are also performed. Our empirical results show a strong performance of technical trading rules in an emerging stock market of Thailand {{but not in a}} more mature stock market of Singapore. The technical trading rules also generate statistical significant returns in the Malaysian, Indonesian and the Philippine markets. However, after taking transaction costs into account, most technical trading rules do not generate net returns. This fact suggests different levels of market efficiency among Southeast Asian stock markets. This paper finds three new insights. Firstly, technical indicators does not help much in terms of market timing. Basically, traders cannot expect to buy at a relative low price and sell at a relative high price by just using technical trading rules. Secondly, technical trading rules can be beneficial to individual investors as they help them to counter the behavioral bias called disposition effects which is the tendency to sell winning stocks too soon and holding on to losing stocks too long. Thirdly, even profitable strategies could not reliably predict subsequent market directions. They make money from having a higher average profit from profitable trades than an average loss from unprofitable ones.|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that froth phase has a {{controlling}} influence on the overall flotation performance. Froth recovery is expected to be affected by froth transportation behaviour. The latter has been represented by different <b>volume</b> <b>balance</b> and energy balance based models. In froth transportation models based <b>on</b> a <b>volume</b> <b>balance,</b> the froth phase is divided into different zones. The total froth residence time is the sum of the time spent in each zone and is dependent on the cell geometry, bubble burst rate and the position that bubbles enter into the froth phase. Alternatively, the froth transportation model based <b>on</b> an energy <b>balance</b> treats the froth phase as a block. In this model, froth height above the concentrate lip is being predicted by minimising the energy of the system which is dependent on the froth geometry, froth stability and froth rheology. The froth height can be used to calculate the froth efficiency of delivering mineralized bubbles from the pulp to the concentrate lip. This paper critically analyses the current models of froth transportation in flotation, and examines the limitations of these models. The importance of froth rheology, which is the resistance to the froth flow towards the discharging weir, in determining froth transportation, is also highlighted...|$|R

The central concept of the solution procedure is a force <b>balance</b> <b>on</b> con-trol <b>volumes</b> corresponding to nodes, where tractions on control volume faces are evaluated using linear interpolation of the unknown stress components at nodal points. An optimization routine incorporating second-order cone programming is subsequently employed to fi nd the stress fi eld that maximizes applied load subject to constraints imposed by equilibrium, boundary conditions, and the yield condition, thereby fi nding a load that is closest to the true collapse load. The for-mulation is for plain strain (i. e. two dimensions) and material obeying the Mohr-Coulomb yield condition. The proposed approach {{is applied to the}} benchmark problem of a uniform strip load applied to a half space, and very good agreement between analytical and numerical results is found. ...|$|R

30|$|There is {{a fairly}} {{comprehensive}} literature related to TA in various financial domains, but {{the remainder of this}} part addresses the ones that are more related to MA. For example, Pruitt and White ([1988]) developed the CRISMA trading system, which combined trading rules of <b>on</b> <b>balance</b> <b>volume,</b> relative strength, and MA and confirmed the profitability of technical trading rules. Sweeney ([1988]), Allen and Taylor ([1990]), and Taylor and Allen ([1992]) find that trading rules can outperform statistical models in predicting exchange rates and stock prices. Bessembinder and Chan ([1995]) and Ratner and Leal ([1999]) following Brock et al. ([1992]) also demonstrated the profitability of simple trading rules, MA, and trading range breakout. Hudson et al. ([1996]) examine prices for the Financial Times Industrial Ordinary Index from 1935 to 1994 and showed that MA trading rules can be utilized for USA and UK markets. As a matter of fact, this study provides novel evidence on the predictive ability of technical trading rules in developed markets with long series of price histories (Gunasekarage and Power [2001]). Mills ([1997]) analyzes daily data on the London Stock Exchange FT 30 index for the period 1935 to 1994. It is found that the trading rules worked, in the sense of producing a return greater than a buy-and-hold strategy, for most of the sample period, at least up to the early 1980 s. Gencay and Stengos ([1998]) use the daily Dow Jones Industrial Average Index from 1963 to 1988 to examine the linear and non-linear predictability of stock market returns with some simple technical trading rules. Some evidence of non-linear predictability in stock market returns is found using the past buy-and-sell signals of the moving average rules. Sullivan et al. ([1999]) examine close to 8, 000 technical trading rules and repeat Brock et al. ([1992]) study while correcting it for data snooping problems. Gunasekarage and Power ([2001]) showed that technical trading rules have predictive ability in South Asian stock markets and reject the null hypothesis that the returns to be earned from studying MA values are equal to those achieved from a naive buy-and-hold strategy. Tian et al. ([2002]) focus in markets with different efficiency level. They found that these simple trading rules are quite successful in Chinese markets in 1990 s, while do not beat the US index during the same period. Ausloos and Ivanova ([2002]) present a generalization of the classical TA concepts taking into account the volume of transactions. Lastly, the purpose of Andrada-Felix and Fernandez-Rodriguez ([2008]) is to improve moving average trading rules with boosting and statistical learning methods. In fact, MA is seen in most of the academic studies of TA that has mainly adopted quantitative indicators as prediction variables, and the literature is full of such studies.|$|E

Functional balance (dynamic equilibrium) is the interplay of imbalance and balance as the body constantly tries to regain balance to perform efficient movement using these senses: ocular (vision), vestibular (inner ear), kinesthetic (body position awareness), and auditory (hearing). There are two “zones ” of balance. Begin training the inner zone (close to center of gravity) before training the outer zone (beyond the static stance center of gravity).

40|$|On {{simulating}} {{an existing}} highway network, traffic engineers and planners use existing traffic counts {{which may be}} collected during different times and days. On simulating a future highway network, they use future intersection volumes post-processed from projected counts or travel demand models. For both cases, an up link volume is usually not balanced with a down link volume in a highway network. To have more reasonable traffic operation simulation results, we should use mathematical techniques for balancing all intersection up link and down link volumes, {{as well as an}} intersection arrival and departure volumes. This presentation introduces two different techniques of <b>balancing</b> intersection <b>volumes</b> in a highway network – a successive link averaging with doubly constraint origin-destination balancing technique and VISUM T-Flow Fuzzy technique. Using intersection level doubly constraint origin-destination balancing technique, we may lose the <b>balance</b> in <b>volumes</b> between up and down links in the highway network. Therefore, both link level <b>volume</b> <b>balancing</b> by successive averaging and intersection level <b>volume</b> <b>balancing</b> using doubly constraint will need to be run concurrently and iteratively until the system reaches its defined convergence criteria. T-Flow Fuzzy technique in VISUM travel demand modeling software is also introduced and compared in resolving the balancing issue. Statistical analyses of goodness of fit are used to compare the <b>balanced</b> intersection <b>volumes</b> with the unbalanced ones by both techniques. The successive averaging with doubly constraint O-D balancing technique shows better statistical fit to the unbalanced volumes than the T-Flow Fuzzy. This method also keeps the total of the <b>balanced</b> <b>volumes</b> in network {{the same as that of}} unbalanced volume, not losing volumes like T-flow Fuzzy technique. A balanced network with more reasonable intersection volumes will provide engineers, planners and policy makers more confidence in network operational or simulation results...|$|R

In this study, a new Austrian glacier inventory has been compiled, updating data from 1969 (GI 1) and 1998 (GI 2) based on high-resolution lidar digital elevation models (DEMs) and orthophotos dating from 2004 to 2012 (GI 3). To expand the time series of digital glacier inventories in the past, the glacier outlines of the Little Ice Age maximum state (LIA) have been digitalized based on the lidar DEM and orthophotos. The resulting glacier area for GI 3 of 415. 11 ± 11. 18 km 2 is 44 % of the LIA area. The annual relative area losses are 0. 3 % yr − 1 for the ~ 119 -year period GI LIA to GI 1 with one period with major glacier advances in the 1920 s. From GI 1 to GI 2 (29 years, one advance period of variable length in the 1980 s) glacier area decreased by 0. 6 % yr − 1 and from GI 2 to GI 3 (10 years, no advance period) by 1. 2 % yr − 1. Regional variability of the annual relative area loss is highest in the latest period, ranging from 0. 3 to 6. 19 % yr − 1.

The model was used to study the effect of both water deficit and salinity build-up during the growing season on yield of cotton for different scenarios, assuming zero leaching, with different irrigation water salinity levels, and allowable percent depletion of water in the root zone. To verify the validity of the model, preliminary one year data from experiment conducted in northern Syria during the summer season of year 2004 for cotton are used. The data included four deficit irrigation levels using drip irrigation system: full irrigation (no deficit); applying 80 %, 60 %, and 40 % of full irrigation. The experiment was laid out in three replications. The main outcome of the study included useful relationships between relative yield with relative crop evapotranspiration as affected by different levels of deficit irrigation and water salinity. Given the salinity of irrigation water and selecting a cretin level of percent water depletion, the relative evapotranspiration (Etcadj/ETc) can be predicted. Upon knowing the relative evapotranspiration, the relative yield under the given conditions can be also evaluated...|$|R
