40|$|Rice paddy fields {{have been}} {{recognized}} as an alternative habitat for avian wetland foragers, and fish-rice farms havebecome a new tool in improving the abundance of aquatic animals. However, {{the use of the}} habitats by avian foragers,particularly by <b>oriental</b> <b>storks</b> (Ciconia boyciana), was not well understood. In the present study, we investigated how afish-rice farm influenced the abundance of aquatic animals and documented the foraging behavior of the two captivebred <b>oriental</b> <b>storks</b> in a closed semi-natural paddy field. Our results showed that the fish refuge pond (water depth 40 cm) had a higher abundance of fish whereas the areas planted with rice (water depth 20 cm) had more tadpoles and someaquatic insects. The two captive bred <b>oriental</b> <b>storks</b> captured mostly fish and aquatic insects in the rice-planted area andmostly fish in the fish refuge pond. The two <b>oriental</b> <b>storks</b> had higher foraging success and spent more time for foragingin the rice-planted area than in the fish refuge pond. This result suggests that the <b>oriental</b> <b>storks</b> might prefer foraging inthe area with fish, aquatic insects, and amphibians under a greater success rate presumably due to shallow water depthin the paddy fields with a fish-rice farm...|$|R

50|$|At one time, the <b>Oriental</b> <b>stork</b> {{could be}} found in Japan, China, Korea and Russia. It is now extinct in Japan and the Korean peninsula. However, in May 2007 a {{hatchling}} was reported in Japan {{for the first time in}} 40 years in the wild. It was offspring of two storks who were bred in captivity. After breeding, the storks migrate to eastern China in September and return in March.|$|E
50|$|The storks have {{a nearly}} {{cosmopolitan}} distribution, being {{absent from the}} poles, most of North America and large parts of Australia, The centres of stork diversity are in tropical Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, with eight and six breeding species respectively. Just three species {{are present in the}} New World: wood stork, maguari stork and jabiru, which is the largest flying bird of the Americas. Two species, white and black stork, reach Europe and western temperate Asia, while one species, <b>Oriental</b> <b>stork,</b> reaches temperate areas of eastern Asia, and one species, black-necked stork, is found in Australasia.|$|E
50|$|The storks vary {{in their}} {{tendency}} towards migration. Temperate species like the white stork, black stork and <b>Oriental</b> <b>stork</b> undertake long annual migrations in the winter. The routes taken by these species have developed to avoid long distance travel across water, and from Europe this usually means flying across the Straits of Gibraltar or east across the Bosphorus and through Israel and the Sinai. Studies of young birds denied the chance to travel with others of their species have shown that these routes are at least partially learnt, rather than being innate {{as they are in}} passerine migrants. Migrating black storks are split between those that make stopovers on the migration between Europe and their wintering grounds in Africa, and those that don't.|$|E
2500|$|This stork was {{formerly}} placed {{in its own}} genus Euxenura, but was later reclassified as belonging to Ciconia because of its large morphological and ethological similarity to other storks of this genus. However, the maguari stork most closely resembles both the white <b>stork</b> and the <b>Oriental</b> white <b>stork</b> in morphology and behaviour; and is especially similar to the white stork in its manner of performing the up-down greeting display. Plumage pattern and soft part colourations are also highly similar between these three stork species. Further, phylogenetic analyses based on {{a portion of the}} cytochrome b oxidase gene have suggested that the maguari stork is evolutionarily paired with the white stork-Oriental white stork sister group; although the morphological similarity between the maguari <b>stork</b> and <b>oriental</b> white <b>stork</b> has been considered to be greater than between the white <b>stork</b> and the <b>Oriental</b> white <b>stork.</b> [...] Incidentally, the maguari stork also shares the prominent forkedness of its tail with the woolly-necked stork.|$|R

50|$|The Asian openbill stork is {{predominantly}} greyish (non-breeding season) or white (breeding season) with glossy black wings and tail {{that have a}} green or purple sheen. The name {{is derived from the}} distinctive gap formed between the recurved lower and arched upper mandible of the beak in adult birds. Young birds do not have this gap. The cutting edges of the mandible have a fine brush like structure that is thought to give them better grip on the shells of snails. The tail consists of twelve feathers and the preen gland has a tuft. The mantle is black and the bill is horn-grey. At a distance, they can appear somewhat like a white stork or <b>Oriental</b> <b>stork.</b> The short legs are pinkish to grey, reddish prior to breeding. Non-breeding birds have a smoky grey wings and back instead of white. Young birds are brownish-grey and have a brownish mantle. Like other storks, the Asian openbill is a broad-winged soaring bird, which relies on moving between thermals of hot air for sustained flight. They are usually found in flocks but single birds are not uncommon. Like all storks, it flies with its neck outstretched. It is relatively small for a stork and stands at 68 cm height (81 cm long).|$|E
40|$|AbstractOptimum {{water depth}} is {{critical}} for wetland restoration as it directly influences the distribution, growth and adaptability of wetland vegetation, community structure, and water bird habitat selection. Reed marshes are the main habitats for water birds, especially for the endangered <b>oriental</b> <b>stork</b> Ciconia boyciana in the Yellow River Delta, China. In this study, we determined the optimum water depth threshold based on: (1) the ecological adaptability of the reed Phragimtes australis along the water gradient of the delta and (2) the preferences of C. boyciana for specific habitat characteristics in different seasons, from March to October 2009. The {{results showed that the}} optimum water depth thresholds in areas with shallow water and dry land are [0, 5. 7] cm and [- 1. 3, 0] cm in spring, [5, 29. 8] cm and [- 3. 7, 0] cm in summer, and [3. 3, 27. 5] cm and [- 7. 7, - 3. 1] cm in fall, respectively.

40|$|Due to {{freshwater}} supplement scarcity {{and heavy}} human activities, the fresh water wetland ecosystem in Yellow River Delta is facing disintegrated deterioration, {{and it is}} seriously affecting {{the health of the}} Yellow River ecosystem. This paper identifies the restoration objectives of wetland aiming to protect ecological and economic values and development as well as the water resources of the Yellow River. The hydraulic and groundwater coupling model and Landscape Ecological Decision and Evaluation Support System (LEDESS) of the Yellow River Delta were established to calculate environmental flows of degraded wetlands. LEDESS is a computer-based model developed and used to assess and evaluate the effects of land-use changes on nature. In this study, LEDESS is used to assess and evaluate the ecological effects and the restoration possibilities considering several environmental flows' supplement scenarios. This included the changes of suitable habitat conditions and its ecological carrying capacities for indicator species, e. g., Red-crowned crane (Grus japonensis), <b>Oriental</b> <b>stork</b> (Ciconia boyciana), and Saunder's gull (Larus relictus), and changing of ecological patterns. The results showed that replenishing fresh water to wetlands is one of the effective adaptive measures to mitigate wetland degradation and improve its habitat quality and carrying capacities. This study indicated that landscape ecology approach is not only considered as a good way to solve complex problems in ecosystem management but also can be used to decide on the environmental flows and assess its ecological effects in large-scale wetland rehabilitation. This integrated method could make environmental flows estimated and assessment more rational than the results of hydrologic methods. It could assist decision makers to "see" the ecological effects after water supplementing and so alleviate the contradictions between environmental flows and production water demands, and can facilitate the implementation of environmental flows in most countries with water resources shortage...|$|E

The typical storks include the white stork {{and six other}} extant species, which are characterised by straight pointed beaks and mainly black and white plumage. Its closest relatives are the larger, black-billed <b>Oriental</b> white <b>stork</b> (Ciconia boyciana) of East Asia, which was formerly classified as a subspecies of the white stork, and the maguari stork (C. maguari) of South America. Close evolutionary relationships within Ciconia are suggested by behavioural similarities and, biochemically, through analysis of both mitochondrial cytochrome b gene sequences and DNA-DNA hybridization.|$|R
25|$|Although colonial {{breeding}} {{is common}} amongst storks, the maguari stork differs in that courting {{takes place in}} congregations before established breeding pairs remove themselves to each of their nesting sites; whereas similar species such as the white <b>stork</b> and the <b>oriental</b> white <b>stork</b> court directly at the nest. These nuptial congregations in the maguari stork occur at freshwater marshes {{that have already been}} flooded with rainwater to a depth of about 20cm and are the venue either for the formation of new pair-bonds in young individuals or for the reunion of mates from previous years. In the latter case however, it is unknown whether both mates enter the courtship assembly together or locate each other after each having migrated there separately.|$|R

A small population of white storks winters in India and is thought to derive principally from the C. c. asiatica population as flocks of up to 200 birds have been observed on spring migration in the early 1900s through the Kurram Valley. However, birds ringed in Germany have been recovered in western (Bikaner) and southern (Tirunelveli) India. An atypical specimen with red orbital skin, a feature of the <b>Oriental</b> white <b>stork,</b> has been recorded and further study of the Indian population is required.
