40|$|This paper {{examines}} how reductions in hospital payments by Medicare affect hospital operations. I {{look at two}} episodes of payment reductions: the late 1980 s and the early 1990 s. I find a large difference in the impact of payment reductions in these two time periods. In the 1980 s, reduced Medicare payments were <b>offset</b> <b>dollar</b> for dollar by increased prices to private insurers. In the 1990 s, however, payment reductions result in lower hospital profits, which must ultimately reduce hospital costs. Hos-pitals {{have responded to the}} payment reductions by reducing the num-ber of beds and nurses, and sometimes by closing entirely, but not by reduced acquisition of high-tech equipment. 1...|$|E
40|$|Advocates {{of a more}} pluralistic {{international}} monetary and financial system seek to reduce reliance on a single national currency and to bring international liquidity under collective control. One recently revived proposal would transform US dollar official reserves into claims denominated in the IMF's key currency basket, Special Drawing Rights (SDRs). Drawing on new archival evidence and simulations, this article highlights issues that derailed earlier agreement on such an account and shortcomings of design and ambition revealed by subsequent developments. One design issue was account losses if US dollar yields failed to exceed SDR yields enough to <b>offset</b> <b>dollar</b> depreciation. In fact, uncovered interest parity did not hold and could well have left the account persistently insolvent. Another shortcoming was ambition: the proposed account proved simply too small to achieve the desired lowering of the dollar's share of foreign exchange reserves. Any new proposal needs to address these shortcomings...|$|E
40|$|This paper conducts {{specification}} {{tests to}} explore the dynamic relationship between the dollar and the U. S. terms of trade (TOT), {{as well as its}} components, U. S. import and export prices. Here import prices are found to respond to the dollar's value, but only after a substantial lag. Export prices display a somewhat weaker response that appears to partially <b>offset</b> the <b>dollar's</b> effect on import prices, muting its effect on the terms of trade. The result is a weak response in the terms of trade that mimics lags found in the dollar's pass-through into import prices. ...|$|R
40|$|Differences in: – How rapidly {{the economy}} and {{emissions}} are projected to grow (However, projections are similar across the studies, which may understate the range of uncertainty) – How policy {{is assumed to be}} implemented: coverage, flexibility in timing of emissions reductions, and so forth – How flexibly households and firms are expected to respond to the policy, and how they discount the future – What technologies are projected to be available at different points in time – What policies other countries are projected to be pursuing Most of the models assume flexible, efficient responses but also largely assume specific technology paths. For both reasons, the full uncertainty in potential costs is probably larger than appears in these figures. U. S.

50|$|The Chicken tax was a 1964 {{response}} by President Lyndon B. Johnson to tariffs placed by Germany (then West Germany) on importation of US chicken. Beginning in 1962, during the President Kennedy administration, the US accused Europe of unfairly restricting imports of American poultry {{at the request}} of West German chicken farmers. Diplomacy failed, and in January 1964, two months after taking office, President Johnson retaliated by imposing a 25 percent tax on all imported light trucks. This directly affected the German built Volkswagen vans. Officially it was explained that the light trucks tax would <b>offset</b> the <b>dollar</b> amount of imports of Volkswagen vans from West Germany with the lost American sales of chickens to Europe. But audio tapes from the Johnson White House reveal that in January 1964, President Johnson was attempting to convince United Auto Workers's president Walter Reuther, not to initiate a strike just prior the 1964 election and to support the president's civil rights platform. Reuther in turn wanted Johnson to respond to Volkswagen's increased shipments to the United States.|$|R
40|$|The {{weakness}} in the economy that emerged late last year has become more persistent and widespread. In response, the FOMC has lowered the target federal funds rate six times this year, for a cumulative total reduction of 2 - 3 / 4 percentage points. A number of factors account for this unusually steep reduction in the federal funds rate, including the magnitude and rapidity of the slowdown {{and the need to}} <b>offset</b> a stronger <b>dollar</b> and lower equity prices. At midyear the information available for the recent performance of both the U. S. economy and some of our key trading partners remains somewhat downbeat, on balance. Nonetheless, a number of factors are in place that should set the stage for stronger growth later this year and in 2002. Moreover, the outlook for productivity growth over the longer run remains favorable. Economic conditions - United States; Monetary policy - United States...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{compared}} cost-effectiveness of pravastatin in a placebo-controlled {{trial in}} 5500 younger (31 - 64 years) and 3514 older patients (65 - 74 years) with previous acute coronary syndromes. METHODS: Hospitalizations and long-term medication within the 6 {{years of the}} trial were estimated in all patients. Drug dosage, nursing home, and ambulatory care costs were estimated from substudies. Incremental costs per life saved of pravastatin relative to placebo were estimated from treatment effects and resource use. RESULTS: Over 6 years, pravastatin reduced all-cause mortality by 4. 3 % in the older patients and by 2. 3 % in the younger patients. Older patients assigned pravastatin had marginally lower cost of pravastatin and other medication over 6 years (A dollar 4442 vs A dollar 4637), but greater cost <b>offsets</b> (A <b>dollar</b> 2061 vs A dollar 897) from lower rates of hospitalizations. The incremental cost per life saved with pravastatin was A dollar 55500 in the old and A dollar 167200 in the young. Assuming no treatment effect beyond the study period, the life expectancy to age 82 years of additional survivors was 9. 1 years in the older and 17. 3 years in the younger. Estimated additional life-years saved from pravastatin therapy were 0. 39 years for older and 0. 40 years for younger patients. Incremental costs per life-year saved were A dollar 7581 in the older and A dollar 14944 in the younger, if discounted at 5 % per annum. CONCLUSIONS: Pravastatin therapy was more cost-effective among older than younger patients, because of their higher baseline risk and greater cost offsets, despite their shorter life expectancy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. According to IAS 39 or FAS 133 an a posteriori {{test for}} hedge {{effectiveness}} {{has to be}} implemented when using hedge accounting. Both standards do not regulate which numerical method has to be used. A number of hedge effectiveness tests have been published recently. Such tests are of different quality, for example {{not all of them}} can deal with the problem of small numbers. This means a test might determine an effective hedge to be ineffective, a scenario which would increase the volatility in earnings. Therefore, it seems useful to have criteria at hand to discriminate and assess hedge effectiveness tests. In this paper, we introduce such objective criteria, which we develop according to our understanding of minimum economic requirements. They are applicable to tests based on market values of two points in time as well as on tests based on time series of market values. According to our criteria we compare common tests like the <b>dollar</b> <b>offset</b> ratio, regression analysis or volatility reduction, showing strengths and weaknesses. Finally we develop a new adjusted Hedge Interval test based on our previous one (2003). Our test does not show weaknesses of other effectiveness test...|$|R
40|$|Requires all {{current and}} future public {{employees}} pay annually at least half projected costs of their pension plan’s defined benefit. Requires hybrid pension plans for new employees, composed of defined benefits, defined contribution, and Social Security. Requires hybrid plans be designed to pay 75 % of final salary after full career, capped at federal Social Security base. Increases minimum retirement age for future law enforcement and firefighters to 52, for others 57. Requires 15 years service for new state employees to receive any retirement health benefits, and reduces employer contribution. Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on {{state and local government}}: Over the next few decades, reduced state and local government personnel costs, offset by some potential additional expenses. The net effect would vary from one public employer to another based on how this measure is interpreted and administered, among other factors. In the long run (a few decades from now), depending on how this measure is administered, potential annual savings in state and local government personnel costs of a few billion dollars per year (in current <b>dollars),</b> <b>offset</b> to some extent by increases in other employee compensation costs...|$|R
