5|$|The cytosol has {{no single}} {{function}} and is instead {{the site of}} multiple cell processes. Examples of these processes include signal transduction from the cell membrane to sites within the cell, such as the cell nucleus, or organelles. This compartment is also the site {{of many of the}} processes of cytokinesis, after the breakdown of the nuclear membrane in mitosis. Another major function of cytosol is to transport metabolites from their site of production to where they are used. This is relatively simple for water-soluble molecules, such as amino acids, which can diffuse rapidly through the cytosol. However, hydrophobic molecules, such as fatty acids or sterols, can be transported through the cytosol by specific binding proteins, which shuttle these molecules between cell membranes. Molecules taken into the cell by endocytosis <b>or</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> way to be secreted can also be transported through the cytosol inside vesicles, which are small spheres of lipids that are moved along the cytoskeleton by motor proteins.|$|E
5|$|Xerocomellus zelleri, {{commonly}} known as Zeller's Bolete, is an edible species of mushroom in the family Boletaceae. First described scientifically by American mycologist William Alphonso Murrill in 1912, the species has been juggled by various authors to several genera, including Boletus, Boletellus, and Xerocomus. Found solely in western North America from British Columbia south to Mexico, the fruit bodies are distinguished by their dark reddish brown to nearly black caps with uneven surfaces, the yellow pores {{on the underside of}} the caps, and the red-streaked yellow stems. The fungus grows in summer and autumn on the ground, often in Douglas fir forests <b>or</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> margins. The development of the fruit bodies is gymnocarpic, meaning that the hymenium appears and develops to maturity in an exposed state, not enclosed by any protective membrane.|$|E

25|$|Unlike predators, parasites {{typically}} do not kill their host, are generally {{much smaller than}} their host, and often live in <b>or</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> host for an extended period. Both are special cases of consumer-resource interactions. Parasites show {{a high degree of}} specialization, and reproduce at a faster rate than their hosts. Classic examples include interactions between vertebrate hosts and tapeworms, flukes, the Plasmodium species, and fleas. Parasitoidy is an evolutionary strategy within parasitism in which the parasite eventually kills its host.|$|E
25|$|A {{bone marrow}} biopsy may {{be done in}} a health care provider's office or in a hospital. Informed consent for the {{procedure}} is typically required.

The skin is cleansed, and a local anesthetic such as lidocaine or procaine is injected to numb the area. Patients may also be pretreated with analgesics and/or anti-anxiety medications, although this is not a routine practice.|$|E

25|$|The ichneumonids {{differ from}} typical, aculeate wasps (Aculeata: Vespoidea and Apoidea), {{in that the}} {{antennae}} have more segments, typically 16 or more, while most other wasps have 13 or fewer. Unlike the aculeate wasps, which sting in defense and do not pass their eggs along the stinger, ichneumonid females have an ovipositor (homologous to the stinger) which they use to lay eggs inside <b>or</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> host. Ichneumonids generally inject venom along with the egg, but only larger species with relatively short ovipositors use the ovipositor in defense. Males do not possess stingers or ovipositors in either lineage.|$|E

The corps was formed by the amalgamation of the various colonial engineer corps of the states and territories of Australia in 1902 and since then has served in various conflicts including World War I, World War II and the Vietnam War. The corps has also served on numerous peacekeeping operations and was heavily involved in the Australian contribution to the war in Afghanistan.|$|E

While the front doors are narrow, the aft doors are wider, having been designed to facilitate the loading of 55-gallon barrels, either upright <b>or</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> sides. The Beaver is considered a 'working' aircraft, which was designed for vigorous use. In addition to cargo, passengers can also be carried; when appropriately fitted out, the Beaver Mk.I can accommodate up to seven passengers while the more spacious Beaver Mk.III can hold a maximum of 11. Various alterations have been approved, including alternative seating arrangements, enlarged cargo doors, larger windows and smaller batteries have been approved for use.|$|E
25|$|In September 1987, a {{radioactive}} accident {{occurred in}} Goiânia, Goiás, after a radiotherapy device {{was stolen from}} an abandoned hospital site in the city.

In the cleanup operation, topsoil {{had to be removed}} from several sites and entire houses were demolished, with their contents removed, examined and eventually destroyed. According to the official account, about 112,000 people were examined for radioactive contamination, 297 were found to have significant levels of radioactive material in <b>or</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> body, and 4 people died.

25|$|The German {{units in}} the {{immediate}} vicinity had in fact been dispatched to reinforce the Gustav Line only a few days earlier. All available reserves from the southern front <b>or</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> way to it were rushed toward Anzio and Nettuno; these included the 3rd Panzer Grenadier and 71st Infantry Divisions, and the bulk of the Luftwaffe's Hermann Göring Panzer Division. Kesselring initially considered that a successful defence could not be made if the Allies launched a major attack on January23 or January24. However, by the end of January22, the lack of aggressive action convinced him that a defence could be made. Nevertheless, few additional defenders arrived on January23 although the arrival on the evening of January22 of Lieutenant General Alfred Schlemm and his 1stParachute Corps headquarters brought greater organisation and purpose to the German defensive preparations. By January24, however, the Germans had over 40,000 troops in prepared defensive positions.|$|E
25|$|People may be {{admitted}} voluntarily if the treating doctor considers that safety isn't compromised by this less restrictive option. Inpatient psychiatric wards may be secure (for those {{thought to have}} a particular risk of violence or self-harm) or unlocked/open. Some wards are mixed-sex whilst same-sex wards are increasingly favored to protect women inpatients. Once {{in the care of}} a hospital, people are assessed, monitored, and often given medication and care from a multidisciplinary team, which may include physicians, pharmacists, psychiatric nurse practitioners, psychiatric nurses, clinical psychologists, psychotherapists, psychiatric social workers, occupational therapists and social workers. If a person receiving treatment in a psychiatric hospital is assessed as at particular risk of harming themselves or others, they may be put on constant or intermittent one-to-one supervision, and may be physically restrained or medicated. People on inpatient wards may be allowed leave for periods of time, either accompanied <b>or</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> own.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} {{sculpture}} in the United States after Europeans' arrival reflects the country's 18th-century foundation in Roman republican civic values and Protestant Christianity. Compared to areas colonized by the Spanish, sculpture {{got off to}} an extremely slow start in the British colonies, with next to no place in churches, and was only given impetus {{by the need to}} assert nationality after independence. American sculpture of the mid- to late-19th century was often classical, often romantic, but showed a bent for a dramatic, narrative, almost journalistic realism. Public buildings during {{the last quarter of the}} 19th century and the first half of the 20th century often provided an architectural setting for sculpture, especially in relief. By the 1930s the International Style of architecture and design and art deco characterized by the work of Paul Manship and Lee Lawrie and others became popular. By the 1950s, traditional sculpture education would almost be completely replaced by a Bauhaus-influenced concern for abstract design. Minimalist sculpture replaced the figure in public settings and architects almost completely stopped using sculpture in <b>or</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> designs. Modern sculptors (21st century) use both classical and abstract inspired designs. Beginning in the 1980s, there was a swing back toward figurative public sculpture; by 2000, many of the new public pieces in the United States were figurative in design.|$|E
