He made a twelve-year study of shearwaters such as the Manx shearwater, living <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>remote</b> island of Skokholm. These small seabirds make {{one of the longest}} migrations of any bird—10,000 kilometres—but return to the exact nesting burrow on Skokholm year after year.

5|$|At the {{declaration}} of war on Britain by the newly formed French Republic on 1 February 1793, British forces in the Indian Ocean held a considerably stronger military position, which was immediately utilised to seize the French territories in India. The remaining French forces continued operating from their base <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>remote</b> island of Île de France, privateers in particular conducting a highly disruptive campaign against British commerce. Attempts by the Royal Navy, commanded by Rear-Admiral Peter Rainier, to limit their effectiveness resulted {{in a number of}} inconsequential clashes and a partial blockade of the French islands.
