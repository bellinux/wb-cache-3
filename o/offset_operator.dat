40|$|Most offset {{approximation}} algorithms for freeform {{curves and}} surfaces may be classified into two main groups. The first approximates the curve using simple primitives such as piecewise arcs and lines and then calculates the (exact) <b>offset</b> <b>operator</b> to this approximation. The second offsets the control polygon/mesh and then attempts {{to estimate the}} error of the approximated offset over a region. Most of the current offset algorithms estimate the error using a finite set of samples taken from the region and therefore can not guarantee the offset approximation is within a given tolerance over the whole curve or surface. This paper presents new methods to globally bound the error of the approximated offset of freeform curves and surfaces and then automatically derive new approximations with improved accuracy. These tools {{can also be used}} to develop a global error bound for a variable distance offset operation and to detect and trim out loops in the offset. 1 Introduction Offset surfaces ar [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Many natural {{materials}} {{and most of}} living tissues exhibit complex deformable behaviours that may be characteriseda s organic. In computer animation, deformable organic material behaviour is needed {{for the development of}} characters and scenes based on living creatures and natural phenomena. This study addresses the problem of deformable organic material behaviour in computer animated objects. The focus of this study is concentrated on problems inherent in geometry based deformation techniques, such as non-intuitive interaction and difficulty in achieving realism. Further, the focus is concentrated on problems inherent in physically based deformation techniques, such as inefficiency and difficulty in enforcing spatial and temporal constraints. The main objective in this study is to find a general and efficient solution to interaction and animation of deformable 3 D objects with natural organic material properties and constrainable behaviour. The solution must provide an interaction and animation framework suitable for the creation of animated deformable characters. An implementation of physical organic material properties such as plasticity, elasticity and iscoelasticity can provide the basis for an organic deformation model. An efficient approach to stress and strain control is introduced with a deformation tool named Vector <b>Offset</b> <b>Operator.</b> Stress / strain graphs control the elastoplastic behaviour of the model. Strain creep, stress relaxation and hysteresis graphs control the viscoelastic behaviour of the model. External forces may be applied using motion paths equipped with momentum / time graphs. Finally, spatial and temporal constraints are applied directly on vector operators. The suggested generic deformation tool introduces an intermediate layer between user interaction, deformation, elastoplastic and viscoelastic material behaviour and spatial and temporal constraints. This results in an efficient approach to deformation, frees object representation from deformation, facilitates the application of constraints and enables further development. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of seismic- derived porosity maps have been further qualified by geologic and production relationships not previously explained nor their significance recognized. Patterns of seismic- derived porosity {{in the upper}} Grayburg compare accurately to geologic well data and to historic oil production in section 36. Areas of economic reservoir seem to be separated hydrodynamically, based on the porosity distribution and related differences of gas- to- oil ratio values. Porosity values east of the current limit of the seismic inversion model (where the current seismic data quality is poor) have been estimated for the Grayburg zones, {{to be used in}} the next production model run. Production data for that area are being requested from <b>offset</b> <b>operators.</b> When those data become available, they will be included in a revised engineering model will be made to match the production history and to simulate the effect of waterflood efforts. The mapping of porosity of the upper Grayburg zones from the seismic data was completed during the third quarter of 1997, with further qualification of the results done during the fourth quarter. The cross- plots of well log- determined porosity versus seismic velocity have shown a strong linear relationship useful for calibrating the conversion of velocity to porosity. Maps of porosity for the A, B, and C zones are being tested against geological and engineering data. Complexity of reservoir demonstrated in those maps has exposed the need to include significantly more geologic and production data in the area around section 36 in order to create a proper model for the Grayburg reservoir in section 36...|$|R

The method of characteristics is applied to reveal the geometric laws of the OC process. With the help of geometric (kinematic) constructions, the equation is proved to be kinematically valid for all offsets and reflector dips in constant velocity media. In the OC process, the angle-dependent reflection coefficient is preserved, and the geometric spreading factor is transformed in accordance with the laws of geometric seismics independently of the reflector curvature...|$|R

40|$|Tourism is {{susceptible}} to the impacts of climate change on destinations and businesses, but also contributes to the causes of climate change via greenhouse gas emissions from travel. This article reports on carbon mitigation actions by environmentally certified tourism enterprises in Queensland, Australia. The survey results profile attitudes to climate change, emissions auditing, carbon mitigation actions, and motives for emissions reduction. The study revealed that most operators believed climate change was an important issue for tourism and had implemented a range of carbon mitigation actions in energy, water, and waste reduction. The most popular actions were energy efficiency and reducing energy use, while less popular measures were adopting renewable energy and carbon <b>offsetting.</b> Tourism <b>operators</b> preferred lower cost actions that were easy to implement and would provide cost savings. The key motives for tourism operators implementing these carbon actions related to ecological responsibility and business competitiveness via cost savings and differentiating their business as 'climate friendly'. These motivations align with general business principles driving the implementation of socially and environmentally responsible practices by companies. The findings suggest that environmentally certified tourism enterprises now consider emissions reduction measures to {{be an integral part}} of sustainable tourism development. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevention}} {{recognition and}} correction of wavelet instability {{is critical to}} exploration success in the present scenario. The proper selection of processing sequence and their quality con-trol can provide improvement for this problem. It has been seen {{that the effect of}} random noise leaking into the deconvolution operator cause most wavelet instability problems. This can be mini-mized by using surface consistent hypothesis. In this hypothesis, a seismic trace is the convolution of source operator, a receiver operator, a reflecdvity <b>operator</b> and <b>offset</b> related <b>operator.</b> Applica-tion of surface consistent deconvolution (SCD) on real data shows tremendous improvement in data quality by reducing random noise, removing the variation of amplitudes due to near surface irregularities and improves the statics estimation. On the other hand, single trace deconvolution fails to do so. In this paper effect of SCD on wavelet stability and seismic attributes have been studied by selecting a portion of seismic line from Vindhyan basin, India. Its robust to any kind of noise and estimation of stable wavelets have also been shown and correlated from the single trace deconvolution. Seismic attributes extracted from surface consistent deconvolved data show major differences as compared to single trace deconvolved data. This improvement of seismic data may be highly helpful in extracting micro-detailed information during interpretation and reservoir char...|$|R
40|$|Penumbras, or soft shadows, are an {{important}} means to enhance the realistic appearance of computer generated images. We present a fast method based on Minkowski operators to reduce the run time for penumbra calculation with stochastic ray tracing. Detailed run time analysis on some examples shows that the new method is significantly faster than the conventional approach. Moreover, it adapts to the environment so that small penumbras are calculated faster than larger ones. The algorithm needs at most twice as much memory as the underlying ray tracing algorithm.

40|$|A three-component shallow {{reflection}} seismic {{line from}} Springbank, Alberta demonstrates large amplitude, surface wave noise {{due to the}} use of a surface energy source. Changes in phase velocity versus frequency, referred to as dispersion, of surface waves is primarily dependent on the shear wave velocities and thicknesses of the wave channels. Shear wave refraction first breaks are picked from the radial or in-line shear wave shot records. These picks are inverted with for near-surface shear wave lithology. This enabled a dispersion model to be calculated which is used to identify and interpret surface wave noise on the shot record. By summing the _o-p wavefleld transform of the vertical and radial component on a shot consistent basis the dispersion curve can be observed directly. The change in phase velocity with frequency can be approximated by a linear frequency modulated (LFM) wave over the frequency bandwidth of the Rayleigh waves. An <b>offset</b> varying compression <b>operator</b> is cross-correlated with each trace in the shot _gather before multi-channel filtering to remove linear dispersion. This reduces dispersed surface waves to a single aliased dip which is more easily removed by the 2 -D median f-k filter. The output is then uncompressed by flipping the operator in time and again cross-correlating. This hybrid multichannel filter is applied to a synthetic shot record contaminated with LFM noise at a bandwidth of 8 - 30 hz with velocity bounds of 230 - 800 m/s. The f-k domain representation of the synthetic shot record has a single focused dip of 520 m/s after LFM compression. This enables better removal of dispersive noise by the multichannel filters such as the velocity f-k or median f-k. This new filter is applied to the real three-component data set. The results indicate {{that the best way to}} minimize surface wave noise in shallow reflection studies is through careful choice of the acquisition parameters to ensure the target events are within the optimum offset window. In this example, the ground roll filtering is unable to recover the underlying reflection signals within the surface wave noise. The best CDP stack obtained for the P-wave data is due to an inside or near offset mute to completely remove the Rayleigh waves from the shot records before stacking. 6...|$|R
