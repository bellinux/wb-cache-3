50|$|Dactyloptena orientalis, known {{commonly}} as the <b>Oriental</b> <b>flying</b> <b>gurnard</b> or purple {{flying gurnard}} among other vernacular names, is {{a species of}} marine fish in the family Dactylopteridae.Their name {{is derived from the}} French word gurnard meaning to grunt, for the grunting sound this fish makes.|$|E
50|$|The <b>oriental</b> <b>flying</b> <b>gurnard</b> has large {{pectoral}} fins {{which it}} normally holds against its body, and expands when threatened to scare predators. Despite its name, it is a demersal fish, not a flying fish, and uses its pelvic fins to {{walk along the}} bottom of the ocean.|$|E
50|$|Dactyloptena is a genus of <b>flying</b> <b>gurnards</b> {{native to}} the Indian and Pacific oceans.|$|R
50|$|Morphological traits uniting the <b>flying</b> <b>gurnards</b> (Dactylopteridae) and the Syngnathiformes {{have long}} been noted. Most authors, however, placed them with the Scorpaeniformes. However, DNA {{sequence}} data quite consistently support {{the belief that the}} latter are paraphyletic with the Gasterosteiformes sensu lato. As it seems, <b>flying</b> <b>gurnards</b> are particularly close to Aulostomidae and Fistulariidae, and probably should be included with these.|$|R
50|$|Ocean Oddities is {{an exhibit}} {{displaying}} pinecone fish, cowfish, <b>flying</b> <b>gurnards,</b> potbellied seahorses, and short dragonfish.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Oriental</b> <b>flying</b> <b>gurnard</b> is {{widespread}} throughout the tropical {{waters of the}} Indo-Pacific region including the Red Sea. Its range extends from the coasts of East Africa to Polynesia and the western, northern and eastern coasts of Australia. It is found on the seabed in bays and estuaries and sandy areas, most often at depths of about 10 m but sometimes as deep as 100 m.|$|E
50|$|The <b>oriental</b> <b>flying</b> <b>gurnard</b> {{can grow}} to 40 cm in length but its common size is about 20 cm. It has a broad {{head with a}} blunt snout and the eyes are set a long way apart. It has a heavily-armoured robust body. The dorsal fin has seven spines and nine soft rays while the anal fin has no spines and six to seven soft rays. The huge, rounded {{pectoral}} fins having many dark spots and wavy streaks and a bright blue edge. Each ray has a feeler-like extension on the tip. This fish is well camouflaged with a grayish brown base color with dark brown or black markings on its head and body.|$|E
40|$|Following {{behaviour}} among reef fishes involves {{mostly a}} digging nuclear species while foraging, which attracts opportunistic followers preying on the exposed organisms. The <b>flying</b> <b>gurnard</b> Dactylopterus volitans preys on benthic animals, mostly crustaceans and small fishes, scratching and probing {{the bottom with}} the inner rays of its pectoral fins. We recorded the <b>flying</b> <b>gurnard</b> being followed by two opportunistic predators, the yellow jack Caranx bartholomaei and the coney Cephalopholis fulva at Fernando de Noronha, off northeast Brazil. Albeit not actually digging the substrate, the <b>flying</b> <b>gurnard</b> acts as a nuclear species by exploring algae tufts and by its wandering near the boulders and ledges, disturbing and flushing out hidden animals which thus become available to predation...|$|R
50|$|Despite its name, the spotwing <b>flying</b> <b>gurnard</b> is {{not related}} to the true flyingfish; these are in the family Exocoetidae, order Beloniformes. Nor is it able to fly, or even to glide as the true flyingfish do.|$|R
50|$|Two {{ships of}} the United States Navy have borne the name Batfish, {{named in honor}} of the batfish, any of several fishes; a pediculate fish of the West Indies, the <b>flying</b> <b>gurnard</b> of the Atlantic, or a California sting ray.|$|R
50|$|The {{pectoral}} fins {{are normally}} held against the body, but when threatened the fins are expanded to startle potential predators which may include sea breams and mackerel. The <b>flying</b> <b>gurnard</b> uses its pelvic fins to {{walk along the}} bottom of the ocean.|$|R
50|$|Some of {{the fish}} {{that can be seen}} in the waters around Crete include: {{scorpion}} fish, dusky grouper, east Atlantic peacock wrasse, five-spotted wrasse, weever fish, common stingray, brown ray, mediterranean black goby, pearly razorfish, star-gazer, painted comber, damselfish, and the <b>flying</b> <b>gurnard.</b>|$|R
40|$|Two pelagic underutilised {{fish species}} in Ghana, the Burrito (Brachydeuterus auritus) and the <b>flying</b> <b>gurnard</b> (Dactylopterus volitans) were {{selected}} for study. Proximate composition analysis indicated high protein content (18 - 22 %), an excellent amino acid profile {{with high levels of}} lysine (7 - 8 %) as well as poly unsaturated fatty acids predominantly 20 : 5 co 3 and 22 : 6 co 3 (omega 3 fatty acids), which constituted between 44 and 51 % of the total fatty acids. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the myofibrillar extracts showed that both fish species may be distinguished from each other by protein bands with molecular weights estimated to be 18, 400 and 14, 300 daltons. Rheological methods, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), phase contrast microscopy and FT-Raman spectroscopy indicated a positive synergistic interaction between <b>flying</b> <b>gurnard</b> proteins and cowpea flour resulting in greater than expected elastic modulus values. The networks were compatible and stabilized by hydrophobic and hydrogen bonds as well as disulfide bonds. Optimum gels were formed with <b>flying</b> <b>gurnard</b> fish and cowpea flour mixed in the ratio of 5 : 5 (w/w) and Burrito fish mince to cowpea flour ratio (2 : 8 w/w). Interactions of the fish minces with cassava starch resulted in phase separation and weak non-covalent interactions. Infant weaning food formulations including <b>flying</b> <b>gurnard</b> mince and other food ingredients showed good nutritional and low viscous properties which compared favourably with commercial infant foods. The shelf life of the products was enhanced with the exclusion of oxygen in vacuum-packed foil packaging. High bloom (275 g) gelatin was produced from <b>flying</b> <b>gurnard</b> fish skin and compared favourably with gelatins from other sources. Using a low cost single screw food extruder built for developing countries, fish based extruded snack pellets incorporating minced burrito: cassava starch, were successfully developed at a barrel temperature of 120 °C. Extruded snack products stored in aluminium foil pouches were better protected in terms of chemical changes in free fatty acids and TBARS formation, than those packaged in polyethylene pouches. This development of fish-based extruded products will lead to new products of high nutritional quality and acceptability as shown by chemical and sensory evaluation results...|$|R
50|$|The <b>flying</b> <b>gurnards</b> are a family, Dactylopteridae, {{of marine}} fish notable for their greatly {{enlarged}} pectoral fins. As they cannot literally fly or glide {{in the air}} (like flying fish), an alternative name preferred by some authors is helmet gurnards. They are the only family in the suborder Dactylopteroidei.|$|R
5000|$|The spotwing <b>flying</b> <b>gurnard,</b> Dactyloptena macracantha, is {{an unusual}} looking fish because of its huge {{pectoral}} fins. The fish has dark spots and wavy lines on the fins. It has a dull head and a grey or sometimes brown body that is covered with dark brown or black spots.|$|R
50|$|The fauna that {{inhabit the}} waters of the island include scads, yellow tail barracudas, and jacks. Other fauna include blacktip sharks, giant clams, claw anemone fishes, {{decorator}} and spider crabs, coral shrimps, nudibranchs, prawn gobies, seahorses, ghost pipefish, <b>flying</b> <b>gurnards,</b> parrotfishes, rays and guitarfish. The indigenous plants include casuarina trees and pandan screwpine.|$|R
40|$|Gelatin {{extracted}} from {{the skin of the}} <b>flying</b> <b>gurnard</b> (Dactylopterus volitans L,) was characterised and its interaction with cassava starch mixtures of different ratio concentrations was investigated by rheology and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Protein and moisture were the main proximate composition, whilst glycine was the main amino acid. The gelatin had high bloom (275 g) strength with high imino acids, proline and hydroxyproline, content of 217 / 1000 residues. Gelation temperatures increased as more starch is used in the mixtures, ranging from 19. 0 °C for gelatin to starch ratio 4 : 1 to 70. 1 °C for mixture 1 : 4. Inclusion of cassava starch also increased the elastic modulus of the gelatin phase. Therefore, gelatin from <b>flying</b> <b>gurnard</b> skin has a potential to serve as an alternative source of non-bovine or porcine gelatin for food applications...|$|R

Entre os peixes recifais, uma espécie fossadora nuclear em atividade de forrageamento pode atrair seguidores oportunistas que se alimentam de organismos expostos pela atividade do nuclear. O coió-voador Dactylopterus volitans alimenta-se de animais bentônicos, principalmente crustáceos e pequenos peixes, explorando o substrato com os primeiros raios externos de suas nadadeiras peitorais. Registramos o coió sendo seguido por dois predadores oportunistas, a guarajuba Caranx bartholomaei e a piraúna Cephalopholis fulva, em Fernando de Noronha, ao largo da costa Nordeste do Brasil. Apesar de não agir como uma espécie fossadora do substrato, o coió atua como uma espécie nuclear por explorar os tufos de algas e também pela sua passagem próxima às rochas e lajes, espantando e desentocando animais escondidos que, assim, tornam-se vulneráveis aos predadores...|$|R

5000|$|The {{maritime}} {{reserve is}} home to various species of crustaceans, molluscs, and fishes including the common cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis), the Pinna nobilis clam that produces sea silk, the Mediterranean moray (Muraena helena) that {{was regarded as a}} delicacy by the Romans, the garfish (Belone belone), and <b>flying</b> <b>gurnard</b> (Dactylopterus volitans), which uses its enlarged pectoral fins to [...] "walk" [...] along the ocean floor. Seaweeds host fish such as bream and grouper.|$|R
5000|$|The wreck now lies at a {{depth of}} around 35 metres but the entire dive may be done at 25 metres. The highest point is {{situated}} only 12 metres deep from the surface. Since it was quite recently sunk compared to the [...] and other wreck sites in Malta, it requires some time to attract a good amount of marine life inside and around it. However, since its sinking, Alicia mirabilis, squid, <b>flying</b> <b>gurnards</b> and rays have already started settling on the former patrol boat.|$|R
50|$|The <b>flying</b> <b>gurnard</b> (Dactylopterus volitans), {{also known}} as the helmet gurnard, is a bottom-dwelling fish of {{tropical}} to warm temperate waters {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic Ocean. On the American side, it is found as far north as Massachusetts (exceptionally as far as Canada) and as far south as Argentina, including the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. On the European and African side, it ranges from the English Channel to Angola, including the Mediterranean. Similar and related species from the genus Dactyloptena are found in the Indian and Pacific Oceans.|$|R
5000|$|As it seems, the loosely delimited Gasterosteiformes are paraphyletic {{with the}} Scorpaeniformes. The more typical {{members of that}} group (e.g. scorpionfishes) are {{apparently}} closer to the [...] "true" [...] Gasterosteiformes, whereas the keel-bodied <b>flying</b> <b>gurnards</b> (Dactylopteridae) seem actually {{to belong to the}} Syngnathiformes clade. It seems that the closest living relatives of the narrowly delimited Gasterosteiformes are the gunnels (Pholidae) and eelpouts (Zoarcidae), traditionally placed in the massively paraphyletic [...] "Perciformes". These two families, as well as the related Trichodontidae, would then appear to be derived offshoots of the scorpaeniform-gasterosteiform radiation which have apomorphically lost the bone [...] "armour" [...] found in their relatives.|$|R
40|$|The dolphinfish, Coryphaena hippurus, is an oceanic {{epipelagic fish}} with {{economic}} importance to sport and commercial fisheries throughout its worldwide distribution in tropical and sub-tropical waters. In the eastern Caribbean, dolphinfish are generally piscivorous, eating {{a wide variety}} of fish species including small oceanic pelagic species (e. g. flyingfish, halfbeaks, man-o-war fish, sargassum and rough triggerfish), juveniles of large oceanic pelagic species (e. g. tunas, billfish, jacks, dolphinfish), and pelagic larvae of neritic, benthic species (e. g. <b>flying</b> <b>gurnards,</b> triggerfish, pufferfish, grunts). They also eat invertebrates (e. g. cephalopods, mysids, scyphozoans), suggesting that they are essentially non-selective foragers. This appears to be typical of dolphinfish from other locations and of tropical oceanic pelagic species in general. Post-larval <b>flying</b> <b>gurnards</b> and flyingfish rank as the most important prey species overall. However, the diet varies with season, and mysids are a very important component from October to December. Diet also varies slightly with predator size (small dolphinfish eat fewer flyingfish and more squid than larger sized dolphinfish), and with sex (males take proportionally more of the active, fast swimming species such as flyingfish, squid and dolphinfish than do females). From these results and {{a review of the literature}} to determine the diet of other tropical oceanic species and the predators of dolphinfish, it can be seen that predator-prey relationships and interspecies competition for food clearly involve other commercially important species. As such, interactions between the surface trolling dolphinfish fisheries, the surface gillnet flyingfish fisheries, and the subsurface longline tuna fisheries in the eastern Caribbean can be expected...|$|R
60|$|Another {{group of}} very {{interesting}} {{fish out of}} water are the <b>flying</b> <b>gurnards,</b> common enough in the Mediterranean and the tropical Atlantic. They are much heavier and bigger creatures than the true flying fish of the herring type, being often {{a foot and a half}} long, and their wings are much larger in proportion, though not, I think, really so powerful as those of their pretty little silvery rivals. All the flying fish fly only of necessity, not from choice. They leave the water when pursued by their enemies, or when frightened by the rapid approach of a big steamer. So swiftly do they fly, however, that they can far outstrip a ship going at the rate of ten knots an hour; and I have often watched one keep ahead of a great Pacific liner under full steam for many minutes together in quick successive flights of three or four hundred feet each. Oddly enough, they can fly further against the wind than before it--a fact acknowledged even by the spectacled Germans themselves, and very hard indeed to reconcile with the orthodox belief that they are not flying at all, but only jumping. I don't know whether the <b>flying</b> <b>gurnards</b> are good eating or not; but the silvery flying fish are caught for market (sad desecration of the poetry of nature!) in the Windward Islands, and when nicely fried in egg and bread-crumb are really quite as good for practical purposes as smelts or whiting or any other prosaic European substitute.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{species of}} fish can [...] "walk" [...] along the sea floor but not on land. One such animal is the <b>flying</b> <b>gurnard</b> (it does not {{actually}} fly, {{and should not be}} confused with flying fish). The batfishes of the Ogcocephalidae family (not to be confused with Batfish of Ephippidae) are also capable of walking along the sea floor. Bathypterois grallator, also known as a [...] "tripodfish", stands on three fins on the bottom of the ocean and hunts for food. The African lungfish (P. annectens) can use its fins to [...] "walk" [...] along the bottom of its tank in a manner similar to the way amphibians and land vertebrates use their limbs on land.|$|R
5000|$|The paired {{pectoral}} fins {{are located}} on each side, usually just behind the operculum, and are homologous to the forelimbs of tetrapods. A peculiar function of pectoral fins, highly developed in some fish, {{is the creation of}} the dynamic lifting force that assists some fish, such as sharks, in maintaining depth and also enables the [...] "flight" [...] for flying fish. In many fish, the pectoral fins aid in walking, especially in the lobe-like fins of some anglerfish and in the mudskipper. Certain rays of the pectoral fins may be adapted into finger-like projections, such as in sea robins and <b>flying</b> <b>gurnards.</b> The [...] "horns" [...] of manta rays and their relatives are called cephalic fins; this is actually a modification of the anterior portion of the pectoral fin.|$|R
40|$|The family Dactylopteridae {{comprises}} seven valid species mostly {{distributed in}} tropical and subtropical seas (Eschmeyer and Fong, 2013). The <b>flying</b> <b>gurnard</b> Dactylopterus volitans (Linnaeus, 1758) {{is present in}} the Eastern Atlantic, apparently from the North Sea to Angola, including the entire Mediterranean Sea and the Azores, and in the Western Atlantic, from Canada to Argentina (Froese and Pauly, 2013). It is the only species of the family Dactylopteridae present in the European Atlantic (from 36 degrees N to 66 degrees N) (Roux, 1986; Quero et al., 2003). The point map of D. volitans given in FishBase (Froese and Pauly, 2013) showed a single record in the Bay of Biscay and a single record point in the Southern North Sea, although the latter seems to be an estimation, not a real observation. This paper reports the first record of D. volitans in the Eastern English Channel...|$|R
25|$|Yellow jack are predatory fish, moving both {{individually}} {{or in small}} groups, with their main prey being small fish, although observational records also show smaller benthic prey is taken. Yellow jack have been observed in a 'following role', moving around with larger species {{to take advantage of}} the commotion caused by the bigger fish, allowing the jack to opportunistically forage or take scraps left by the larger fish. As well as other teleosts, yellow jack have also been recorded following eels, stingrays and nurse sharks. In one case, they were observed following a <b>flying</b> <b>gurnard,</b> itself smaller than the jack, that disturbed the substrate, causing various organisms to be displaced and become available for predation. As well as being 'followers', larger specimens have also been observed as the 'followed' species. The species has also been observed living in close relationships with spinner dolphins, feeding off the dolphin's waste products. This behavior has also been observed in a number of other jacks living in the region.|$|R
