5|$|A {{number of}} former rail lines in Melbourne and {{regional}} Victoria have {{been converted into}} rail trails, for walking, cycling and horse riding. These make excellent tracks for beginners as the lines were <b>originally</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> avoid steep gradients. Most lines are still in public ownership. Some sections of the track are specially leased to neighbouring farmers for stock grazing. This reduces maintenance costs.|$|E
5|$|While most URI schemes were <b>originally</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> be {{used with}} a {{particular}} protocol, and often have the same name, they are semantically different from protocols. For example, the scheme http is generally used for interacting with web resources using HTTP, but the scheme file has no protocol.|$|E

5|$|An {{improvement}} of the CFM56-5A series, it was <b>originally</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> power the A321. With a thrust range between 22,000 and 33,000lbf (98kN and 147kN) it can power every model in the A320 family (A318/A319/A320/A321) and has superseded the CFM56-5A series. Among the changes from the CFM56-5A is the option of a double-annular combustor that reduces emissions (particularly NOx), a new fan in a longer fan case, and a new low-pressure compressor with a fourth stage (up from three in earlier variants). It is the most numerous engine supplied to Airbus.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{resurgence}} of Māori culture, the traditional crafts of carving and weaving are now more widely practised and Māori artists are increasing in number and influence. Most Māori carvings feature human figures, generally with three fingers and either a natural-looking, detailed head or a grotesque head. Surface patterns consisting of spirals, ridges, notches and fish scales decorate most carvings. The pre-eminent Māori architecture consisted of carved meeting houses (wharenui) decorated with symbolic carvings and illustrations. These buildings were <b>originally</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> be constantly rebuilt, changing and adapting to different whims or needs.|$|E
5|$|Line A {{is renowned}} for having kept its {{original}} 1913 rolling stock {{running on the}} line up until 2013, making them the oldest underground carriages in commercial service {{in the world at}} the time. They were built by La Brugeoise, et Nicaise et Delcuve, a Belgian rolling stock manufacturer established in the city of Bruges, between 1913 and 1919. Entirely made of wood, they were <b>originally</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> run as underground as well as tramway cars, but they were adapted in 1927 to their current style for underground service only.|$|E

5|$|<b>Originally</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> create dynamic web pages, PHP now focuses {{mainly on}} {{server-side}} scripting, {{and it is}} similar to other server-side scripting languages that provide dynamic content from a web server to a client, such as Microsoft's Classic ASP, Sun Microsystems' JavaServer Pages, and mod_perl. PHP has also attracted the development of many software frameworks that provide building blocks and a design structure to promote rapid application development (RAD). Some of these include PRADO, CakePHP, Symfony, CodeIgniter, Laravel, Yii Framework, Phalcon and Zend Framework, offering features similar to other web frameworks.|$|E
5|$|The Annie Awards is an {{animation}} award show {{created and}} {{produced by the}} Los Angeles, California branch of the International Animated Film Association, ASIFA-Hollywood, since 1972. <b>Originally</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> celebrate lifetime or career contributions to animation {{in the fields of}} producing, directing, animation, design, writing, voice acting, sound and sound effects, etc., in 1992 it began to honor animation as a whole, and created the category of Best Animated Feature. New categories were subsequently added for different animation media. Wainwright has been nominated once.|$|E
5|$|The Lexington-class {{ships were}} <b>originally</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> be battlecruisers, with heavy guns, high speed, and {{moderate}} armor protection. The Navy laid down six ships {{of the class}} in 1919–20. When the battlecruisers were cancelled under the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, two of the unfinished ships were designated for completion as carriers. Lexington and Saratoga were selected since {{they were the most}} advanced of the six ships in construction.|$|E

5|$|The {{road was}} <b>originally</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> connect local {{industrial}} communities together {{in addition to}} bypassing London, and was constructed in the 1920s and '30s. It received significant upgrades after the Second World War, and was at one point planned to be upgraded to motorway {{as part of the}} controversial and ultimately cancelled London Ringways scheme in the late 1960s. In the early 1990s, the road was extended to bypass Barking and meet the A13 north of Woolwich.|$|E
5|$|The train {{doors were}} <b>originally</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> be {{opened and closed}} {{automatically}} and the doors would re-open if an object blocked them, much as elevator doors do. Almost immediately after the system opened in 1976 Metro realized these features were not conducive to safe or efficient operation and they were disabled. At present the doors may be opened automatically or manually. If a door tries to close and it meets an obstruction, the operator must re-open the door.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the road}} was <b>originally</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> be a freeway, budget {{limitations}} precluded the construction of overpasses; apart from the interchanges with Highway401, Laird Road, and Wellington Street West (Highway7 and former Highway24), all junctions are at-grade intersections. There are also two railway crossings near the northern terminus, though both are for spur lines. The Hanlon is graded and landscaped similarly to a freeway, with broad flat shoulders and an open median.|$|E
25|$|Ohio {{spent most}} of her career on the Liverpool-Philadelphia route she had <b>originally</b> been <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> service. After 25 years of transatlantic crossings, Ohio was sold in 1898 for service in the Alaskan gold rush. She was wrecked in British Columbian waters in 1909.|$|R

5|$|A {{major theme}} {{of the game is}} heroism, where being a hero may bring more harm than help. During development, there was a point at the {{beginning}} of the game where players could choose to leave Dubai. This was cut from the game, as the team found it not effective enough, and it broke a player's immersion in the game. According to Williams, the choice system was <b>originally</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> be similar to Fable II, where after a player makes a decision, they cannot reload the game and choose differently unless they start a new game. This was later removed due to the game's structure as a shooter, as the team feared that it might make the game unwinnable and cause players to feel frustrated. Williams later added that adding achievements to the game was a mistake, as it disrupts the game's narrative.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1999, {{the ballroom}} dance scene of Final Fantasy VIII was {{featured}} {{as a technical}} demo for the PlayStation 2. In 2000, a PC version was released for Windows. This port featured smoother graphics, enhanced audio, and the inclusion of Chocobo World, a minigame starring Boko, a Chocobo featured {{in one of the}} side-quests in Final Fantasy VIII. For most North American and European players, the PC version of the game was the only means of playing Chocobo World, as the game was <b>originally</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> be played via the PocketStation, a handheld console never released outside Japan. In 2009, Final Fantasy VIII was added to the PlayStation Store on the PlayStation Network.|$|E
5|$|Funds were {{provided}} {{for the purchase of}} a 6-inch (150mm) refracting telescope from T. Cooke & Sons. The dome was <b>originally</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> mount a small transit, and the lengthy telescope, over 2 metres long, had a limited field of view though the dome's opening. A large stone pillar was constructed inside the tower, raising the telescope to bring it closer to the dome and improve its field of view. Unfortunately, the new telescope was unable {{to take part in the}} transit measurements due to bad weather, and missed the 1895 Transit of Mercury for the same reason.|$|E
50|$|During {{the initial}} phase of construction, in 2006, {{engineers}} discovered a higher water table than anticipated.

5|$|Her career {{started to}} gain {{significant}} and sustained momentum. In 1989, McEntire married her manager and former steel guitar player, Narvel Blackstock. The couple wed {{in a private}} ceremony on a boat in Lake Tahoe. Together, the pair took over all aspects of McEntire's career, forming Starstruck Entertainment, which was <b>originally</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> help manage her career. From her marriage to Blackstock, McEntire inherited three stepchildren - Chassidy, Shawna, and Brandon - and then {{gave birth to a}} son, Shelby Steven McEntire Blackstock, in February 1990. On August 3, 2015, it was announced in a joint statement on McEntire's website that she and Blackstock had been separated for a few months after twenty-six years of marriage.|$|E
5|$|O'Neill, Daniel, and Teal'c try {{to obtain}} {{intelligence}} {{on the little}} self-replicating robotic invaders in the submarine, but {{they are forced to}} fall back. With Daniel's new theory that the Replicators are made up of the same materials they consume, the Replicators may be eliminated through sinking the iron submarine as long as the surviving Replicator from Thor's advanced ship is destroyed beforehand. Meanwhile, Carter witnesses a short battle against the Replicators in the Asgard galaxy during which five Asgard ships are lost. Carter notices the Replicators' attraction to new technology and proposes to use the O'Neill, an incomplete Asgard ship <b>originally</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> fight the Replicators, as a lure to draw the Replicators into hyperspace and destroy them in the O'Neills self-destruct. Thor eventually accepts the plan, the Replicators take the bait and are destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Since 1958, the Cup has {{undergone}} several minor alterations. The original collar and bowl were too brittle, and were replaced in 1963 and 1969, respectively. The modern one-piece Cup design {{was introduced in}} 1958, when the old barrel was replaced with a five-band barrel, each of which could contain 13 winning teams. Although the bands were <b>originally</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> fill up during the Cup's centennial year, {{the names of the}} 1965 Montreal Canadiens were engraved over a larger area than allotted and thus there are 12 teams on that band instead of 13. When the bands were all filled in 1991, the top band of the large barrel was preserved in the Hockey Hall of Fame, and a new blank band was added to the bottom so the Stanley Cup would not grow further.|$|E
