5|$|Pearl Jam {{promoted}} the album with tours in Australia, Japan, and North America in 2003. The tours were the band's first with keyboardist Boom Gaspar. The two {{legs of the}} North American tour focused on the Midwestern United States, the East Coast, and the West Coast, and had more concerts in arenas. The trauma of Roskilde lead the tour to lack performances on festivals and <b>open</b> <b>floor</b> venues.|$|E
5|$|The towers were {{designed}} as framed tube structures, giving tenants <b>open</b> <b>floor</b> plans, unobstructed by columns or walls. This design {{was accomplished by}} using many closely spaced perimeter columns, providing much of the structure's strength, with the gravity load shared with the core columns. The elevator system, which made use of sky lobbies and a system of express and local elevators, allowed substantial floor space {{to be used for}} office purposes by making the structural core smaller. The design and construction of the towers involved many other innovative techniques, such as wind tunnel experiments and the slurry wall for digging the foundation.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the church consists of a large, <b>open</b> <b>floor</b> plan, with wooden pews lined perpendicular {{to the north and}} south sides, thus creating a central aisle. The altar is a small wooden pulpit, which serves as a lectern that is accessible by a small wooden step; the altar is accented by a large wooden backdrop of casing with dentil molding. Each of the church's interior walls is covered with pine wainscot panelling and wallpaper, and topped with wooden crown molding. Wooden swag moldings accentuate the four symmetrically-placed six-over-six double-hung sash wooden windows, the doorway's wooden casing, and the transom window. The wooden pews are simple, with cushions added for comfortable seating. The original ceiling is obscured by a dropped ceiling, which also conceals the electrical conduits for the church's brass chandeliers. Prior to the church's electrification, kerosene lanterns were used for light, and the lanterns remain in the church for decorative purposes. The church's floor consists of the original heart pine planks. Concrete blocks and cut stone border the building's perimeter to prevent animals from entering the church's crawl space. Within the crawl space, log carrier beams support the building, on which the bark remains extant.|$|E

25|$|The Alamodome {{opened with}} 38 luxury suites and 6,000 club level seats. The {{original}} design specifications called for 66 luxury suites. However, since the Spurs {{were the only}} full-time tenant at the time, only 38 luxury suites in {{the north end of}} the facility were built. The footprints for the 28 unbuilt luxury suites were <b>open</b> <b>floor</b> space just behind the club level seats that surround the south end of the facility. In 2006, the Alamodome underwent an expansion to accommodate 14 new luxury suites. The Sports Club and the Top of the Dome restaurant also received renovations in 2004.|$|E
40|$|Mekaad Radwan {{monument}} {{is situated}} {{in the neighborhood of}} Bab Zuweila in the historical Cairo, Egypt. It was constructed at the middle XVII century (1635 AD). The building has a rectangle shape plan (13  ×  6  m) with the longitudinal sides approximately WNW-ESE. It comprises three storages namely; the ground floor; the <b>opened</b> <b>floor</b> (RADWAN Bench) and the living floor with a total elevation of 15  m above the street level. The building suffers from severe deterioration phenomena with patterns of damage which have occurred over time. These deterioration and damages could be attributed to foundation problems, subsoil water and also to the earthquake that affected the entire Greater Cairo area in October 1992. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) scan was accomplished against the walls of the <b>opened</b> <b>floor</b> (RADWAN Bench) to evaluate the hazard impact on the walls textures and integrity. The results showed an anomalous feature through the southern wall of RADWAN Bench. A mathematical model has been simulated to confirm the obtained anomaly and the model response exhibited a good matching with the outlined anomaly...|$|R

25|$|Griffin's first {{independent}} {{commission was}} a landscape {{design for the}} State Normal School at Charleston, Illinois, {{now known as the}} Eastern Illinois University. In the fall of 1906, he received his first residential job from Harry Peters. The Peters' House was the first house designed with an L-shaped or <b>open</b> <b>floor</b> plan. The L-shape was an economical design and easily constructed. From 1907, 13 houses in this style were built in the Chicago neighborhood now known as Beverly-Morgan Park. Seven of these houses are on W. 104th Place in Beverly, Chicago. This street is now named Walter Burley Griffin Place, and forms a municipal historical district within the national Ridge Historic District, as it contains the largest collection of small scale Griffin designs.|$|E
25|$|The Pauline and Stanley Foster Pavilion for Cancer Care is a 108-bed {{facility}} {{affiliated with}} Moores Cancer Center and {{dedicated to the}} treatment of advanced cancers. It is the only dedicated inpatient cancer hospital in San Diego. The pavilion occupies the fourth, fifth, and sixth floors of Jacobs Medical Center and is named for a $7.5 million dollar gift from Pauline Foster. Patients will have access to over 100 cancer subspecialists working at Moores Cancer Center. The sixth floor of the hospital, jointly operated with Sharp HealthCare, is the only <b>open</b> <b>floor</b> in California with full-unit air filtration, allowing blood and marrow transplant patients and those undergoing chemotherapy to socialize and roam throughout the floor. Procedures such as laser ablation of brain tumors are handled downstairs in the Vassiliadis Pavilion.|$|E
25|$|The tower levels (L1 - L9) each {{comprise}} long, <b>open</b> <b>floor</b> {{plans with}} later lightweight partitions. Window sills are black terrazzo. Small services cores bookend each floor, {{on the east}} and west sides of the tower. These contain fire stairs, service risers, store rooms, and kitchenettes. Some levels retain original black bean veneer fire doors. The top level of the tower (L10) contains two large auditoriums. The larger of the two, named the Charles Barton Auditorium, is double-height and has a raised stage with a proscenium arch, velvet curtains, wings spaces either side, and a backstage area with changing rooms. Under the stage is a storage area accessed via original, battened timber doors. The auditoriums are serviced by a single projection room on a mezzanine between the rooms, accessed via a narrow timber stair.|$|E
30|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} BMI on seismic resistance, two models were considered as Model 1 and Model 2.

In both the models contribution of BMI towards lateral strength and stiffness of the building is considered.|$|R
50|$|Both {{historically}} and after its renovation, {{the fourth floor}} contains the viewing galleries for {{both the house and}} senate chambers, along with several offices and committee rooms. Much of the <b>floor</b> is <b>open</b> to <b>floors</b> below, allowing visitors to look down on the third or second floors in several locations. When the capitol <b>opened,</b> this <b>floor</b> was also used as an art gallery, and currently it contains several small exhibits along with a statue of Philo Farnsworth, a developer of television and a Utah native.|$|R
50|$|Kronohäkte (the Crown Prison) {{built in}} 1910-1911 was {{designed}} by F. Bothén according to the Philadelphia Model approach with <b>open</b> <b>floors</b> to supervision easier. It was developed {{during the first half}} of the 1800s with one-man cells along the walls around a central atrium. Behind the jail, there were fenced exercise areas and a surveillance tower. Kronohäkte was a detention center until the 1970s. Today it offers teaching facilities for the Hyper Island Business Management and Digital Media school which was founded in 1996 (see below).|$|R
25|$|Tange {{organised}} {{the spaces}} of the three firms by function {{to allow them to}} share common facilities. He stacked these functions vertically according to need, for example, the printing plant is on the ground floor to facilitate access to the street for loading and transportation. He then took all the service functions including elevators, toilets and pipes and grouped them into 16 reinforced concrete cylindrical towers, each with an equal 5 metre diameter. These he placed on a grid into which he inserted the functional group facilities and offices. These inserted elements were conceived of as containers that were independent of the structure and could be arranged flexibly as required. This conceived flexibility distinguished Tange's design from other architects' designs with <b>open</b> <b>floor</b> offices and service cores – such as Kahn's Richards Medical Research Laboratories. Tange deliberately finished the cylindrical towers at different heights to imply that there was room for vertical expansion.|$|E
500|$|As NeXT expanded, more {{office space}} was needed. The company rented an office at 800 and 900 Chesapeake Drive in Redwood City, also {{designed}} by Pei.

50|$|The {{foundations}} {{were laid}} in Easter week, 1899. On Whit Monday, twelve workers {{began with the}} construction of the tower. Good weather favoured the work, so that on 17 June 1899 the building was already finished. The tower ascent has over 152 stairway steps, on twelve <b>open</b> <b>floors.</b> The tower consists of 23 tons of iron. The cost estimate of 10,000 Marks was not exceeded. The observation platform of Lemberg Tower is 30 metres above ground. With the flag pole on its top the tower is 34 metres tall.|$|R
500|$|Jobs found {{office space}} in Palo Alto, California on 3475 Deer Creek Road, occupying {{a glass and}} {{concrete}} building which featured a staircase designed by architect I. M. Pei. The first floor used hardwood flooring and large worktables where the workstations would be assembled. To avoid inventory errors, NeXT used the just-in-time (JIT) inventory strategy. The company contracted out for all major [...] such as mainboards and cases and had the finished components shipped {{to the first floor}} for assembly. The second floor was the office space with an <b>open</b> <b>floor</b> plan. The only enclosed rooms were Jobs's office and a few conference rooms.|$|E

500|$|The church {{interior}} has an <b>open</b> <b>floor</b> plan, with {{a sanctuary}} measuring [...] wide and [...] long. The floor plan {{is an open}} nave, with two aisles partitioning three sections of rectangular wooden pews. Although the pews had been painted white, they have been restored to their original wood finish. The sanctuary's interior walls are plaster, and the floors are sheathed in wide wooden planks. The nave is topped by a ceiling fabricated on tongue and groove wooden planks painted white. Three large stained-glass windows, framed by wooden molding and recessed approximately , are symmetrically located on the northeastern and southwestern walls. The lower portion of each window contains a memorial dedication, which opens into its lower hopper sash. On the northwestern side of the interior are the two main entry doors, which access an unadorned narthex. Two tapered-square pilasters support an upper gallery loft, possibly used by slaves during religious services. The gallery is fronted by a solid balustrade, accented with dentil molding and recessed wooden panels.|$|E

500|$|The World Trade Center towers {{included}} many structural engineering innovations in skyscraper design and construction, which allowed the buildings to reach new heights {{and become the}} tallest in the world. Traditionally, skyscrapers used a skeleton of columns distributed throughout the interior to support building loads, with interior columns disrupting the floor space. The tube-frame concept, earlier introduced by Fazlur Khan, was a major innovation, allowing <b>open</b> <b>floor</b> plans and more space to rent. The buildings used high-strength, load-bearing perimeter steel columns called Vierendeel trusses that were spaced closely {{together to form a}} strong, rigid wall structure. There were 60 perimeter columns, narrowly spaced, {{on each side of the}} buildings. In all, the perimeter walls of the towers were [...] on each side, and the corners were beveled. [...] The perimeter columns were designed to provide support for virtually all lateral loads (such as wind loads) and to share the gravity loads with the core columns. Structural analysis of major portions of the World Trade Center were computed on an IBM 1620.|$|E
2500|$|The {{project goals}} for the {{building}} were to develop a sustainable building without air conditioning. [...] Sustainable strategies incorporated into the design include shallow floor plates, operable windows, a central, open air courtyard, different treatments on the façades to minimize heat retention, and floor to ceiling glass at optimal height to depth ratios and <b>open</b> <b>floor</b> plans to maximize daylight.|$|E
2500|$|Wright's {{residential}} {{designs of}} this era {{were known as}} [...] "prairie houses" [...] because the designs complemented the land around Chicago. [...] Prairie style houses often have {{a combination of these}} features: One or two-stories with one-story projections, an <b>open</b> <b>floor</b> plan, low-pitched roofs with broad overhanging eaves, strong horizontal lines, ribbons of windows (often casements), a prominent central chimney, built-in stylized cabinetry, and a wide use of natural materials—especially stone and wood.|$|E

50|$|The {{bell tower}} is {{composed}} of four Paschal candles which symbolize the four Evangelists who proclaimed the Resurrection. These join together around the central shaft of stairs. The winding staircase leads to two <b>open</b> <b>floors</b> with 16 bells. A four-sided clock sits above the bells. The two underground levels below the Cathedral church were used to fulfill the Church’s need for a Cultural and Conference Center. The Center has an amphitheater with a capacity for 500-850 people which {{may be used to}} host lectures, shows, and concerts. The auxiliary wings and backstage allow this hall {{to be used as a}} theater also.|$|R
