5|$|Matthias {{expelled}} George of Poděbrady's {{troops from}} Silesia. Matthias's army was encircled and routed at Uherský Brod on 2 November, {{forcing him to}} withdraw to Hungary. Matthias soon ordered the collection <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>extraordinary</b> tax without holding a Diet, raising widespread discontent among the Hungarian Estates. He visited Emperor Frederick in Vienna on 11 February 1470, hoping the Emperor would contribute to {{the costs of the}} war against Poděbrady. Although the negotiations lasted for a month, no compromise was worked out. The Emperor also refused to commit himself to promoting Matthias's election as King of the Romans. After a month, Matthias left Vienna without taking formal leave of Frederick III.|$|E
5|$|Cole {{completely}} reprinted {{the minutes}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>extraordinary</b> {{meeting of the}} Royal Institution of December 23, 1820, which show that these events were initiated through an observation made by a librarian of the Royal Institution named Sturt. Sturt reported to his superiors that on November 5, 1820, a number of pages were removed from books in the reading room of the institution, books Accum had read. On the instructions of his superiors, Sturt cut a small {{hole in the wall}} of the reading room to watch Accum from an adjoining room. On the evening of December 20, as recorded in the minutes, Sturt could see Accum tear out and walk off with a paper concerning the ingredients and uses of chocolate. The paper had been in an issue of Nicholson’s Journal. Accum's premises on Old Compton Street were searched on the order of a magistrate for the City of London, and torn pages were indeed discovered there. These could be matched to books belonging to the Royal Institution.|$|E

This is a stylish and very {{consistent}} release, with many tunes by John Coltrane.

In this respect they were part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>extraordinary</b> influx of German art historians into the English-speaking academy in the 1930s.

25|$|With the {{beginning}} of the 17th century, confederations became an increasingly significant element of the Commonwealth's political scene. In the 17th and 18th centuries, confederations were organized by magnates, and were either pro- or anti-royal. A confederation not recognized by the king was considered a rokosz ("rebellion"), although some of the rokosz would be eventually recognized by the king, who could even join them himself. Most pro-royal confederations were usually formed as a response to an anti-royal one, and some would take a form <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>extraordinary</b> session of the parliament (sejm), as happened in 1710, 1717 and 1735.|$|E

After a council meeting on 5 June again rejected a legal budget (by 32–30), the Audit Commission stated that a letter would be sent immediately to all councillors who had not voted for the motion (possibly including two Conservatives who had been absent) notifying them <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>extraordinary</b> audit and possible surcharge over lost interest which by then amounted to over £270,000.|$|E
