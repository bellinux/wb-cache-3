5000|$|Brunoise is {{a culinary}} knife cut {{in which the}} food item is first julienned and then turned a quarter turn and diced again, {{producing}} cubes of about 3 mm <b>or</b> less <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> <b>or</b> 1/8-inch dice. In France, a [...] "brunoise" [...] cut is smaller, 1 to 2 mm <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> <b>or</b> 1/16-inch dice. Some typical vegetables for a brunoise are carrots, celery, leeks, and turnips. The diced vegetables are blanched briefly in salty boiling water and then submerged in salted ice water {{for a few seconds}} to set the color. The brunoise is used as a garnish in many dishes; it is often used to garnish consommé. A brunoise should be consistent in size and shape, as this helps to create a pleasing and professional presentation.|$|R
50|$|With the canting keel {{handling}} the ballast functions, lateral resistance and steering {{can be managed}} separately with a foil (or pair of foils, either <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> fore and aft), such as daggerboards.

5000|$|Some {{types of}} fast-swimming fish have a {{horizontal}} caudal keel just {{forward of the}} tail fin. Much like the keel of a ship, this is a lateral ridge on the caudal peduncle, usually composed of scutes (see below), that provides stability and support to the caudal fin. There may be a single paired keel, one <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> <b>or</b> two pairs above and below.|$|R

Except for the waist guns, the turrets had two guns each. Offensive armament could consist of up to 20,000lb of bombs in internal bomb bays in the wing center section (five bays <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side)</b> <b>or</b> of two Mk.13 or Mk.15 torpedoes slung under the wing center section.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to investigate the role of pre- and postnatal manganese (Mn) exposure on hydroxyl radical (HO•) formation in the brains of dopa-mine (DA) partially denervated rats (Parkinsonian rats).

40|$|Ducted flow {{devices for}} a range of purposes, such as air-moving fans, are {{routinely}} characterised experimentally to understand their acoustic performance as part of the continuing trend for quiet, high efficiency design. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) method 5136 is widely used in industry and academia to determine the sound radiated into a duct. This involves placing the device at the centre of a long cylindrical duct with anechoic terminations at each end to eliminate reflections. A single off-axis microphone is used on the inlet and outlet sides that can theoretically capture the plane-wave mode amplitudes but this does not provide enough information to fully account for higher-order modes. In this study, the 'two-port' source model is formulated to include higher-order modes and applied for the first three modes as a proof of concept. This requires six independent surface pressure measurements <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> 'port'. The resulting experimental set-up is much shorter than the ISO rig and does not require anechoic terminations. The relative importance of the higher-order modes has been considered and the inaccuracies when using the ISO method to find source sound power has been analysed.

40|$|A {{field test}} of {{integrated}} vector control {{was conducted in}} a tropical urban setting {{with a combination of}} a floating, slow-release, granular formulation of Bacillus sphaericus and environmental engineering measures (renovation of roads, collective water pumps, and cesspool lids). The targets were Culex quinquefasciatus and Anopheles gambiae in the two biggest towns of Burkina Faso (West Africa). Within the intervention zone, water pumping stations were improved and the surroundings drained to prevent the accumulation of stagnant water. Roads were leveled and given either simple gutters <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> a concrete channel on one side to drain runoff water. Garbage containers were installed to provide an alternative to the drainage channels for waste disposal. Septic tanks were modified so that they could be emptied without destroying their lid. This study showed {{that it is possible to}} implement mosquito control in a tropical urban environment with teams of young people rapidly trained to apply a biological larvicide without any tools other than an iron bar to lift cesspool lids. Environmental improvements were initially costly, but demanded little subsequent expenditure. Local inhabitants' committees were mobilized to provide people with information and monitor the efficacy of the measures. Compared with what people spent individually on mosquito prevention and malaria medicine, these measures were not expensive, but many expected the community to pay for them from existing taxes, e. g., for water treatment and disposal. The necessary funding and logistics require a municipal organization with neighborhood support, if the measures are to be effective. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
