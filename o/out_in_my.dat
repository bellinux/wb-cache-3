25|$|Many of {{the young}} Kashgari women were most {{attractive}} in appearance, {{and some of the}} little girls quite lovely, their plaits of long hair falling from under a jaunty little embroidered cap, their big dark eyes, flashing teeth and piquant olive faces reminding me of Italian or Spanish children. One most beautiful boy stands <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> memory. He was clad in a new shirt and trousers of flowered pink, his crimson velvet cap embroidered with gold, and as he smiled and salaamed to us I thought he looked like a fairy prince. The women wear their hair in two or five plaits much thickened and lengthened by the addition of yak's hair, but the children in several tiny plaits.|$|E

Truman would later report that [...] "I was ready to kick him into the North China Sea...I was never so put <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life." [...] Truman felt that MacArthur's communiqué, which had not been cleared {{in accordance with the}} December directive, had pre-empted his own proposal. He later wrote: ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{disappointed}} not to {{have seen}} any action during the night of D-Day, and still unsure of their actual impact, the bomber crews felt proud of the operations. Squadron Leader Les Munro of No. 617 Squadron wrote, [...] "I have always considered the operation in one sense {{to be the most}} important the squadron carried <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> time– not because [...] bad weather, nor because of any threat of enemy action and not measured by any visible results, but because of the very exacting requirements to which we had to fly and navigate".|$|E

500|$|For the Astral Weeks sessions, {{apparently}} {{they did not}} employ any lead sheets, or at least none were distributed to the musicians. [...] "What stood <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind {{was the fact that}} he allowed us to stretch out," [...] recalls Berliner. [...] "We were used to playing to charts, but Van just played us the songs on his guitar and then told us to go ahead and play exactly what we felt." [...] Berliner actually had great appreciation for the freedom given to him and the band; something few, if any, of them were used to. [...] "I played a lot of classical guitar on those sessions and it was very unusual to play classical guitar in that context," [...] says Berliner.|$|E
500|$|Plans for {{a sequel}} to The Expendables were in place before the film's release in August 2010; Stallone said, [...] "I have an idea ready to go...I'm {{going to try to}} do {{something}} that's quite radical". In an interview in August 2010 he noted that he did not have a new script yet, but [...] "It's plotted <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind's eye." [...] On April 18, 2011, Stallone confirmed that he would not be repeating his directing duties in The Expendables, making a list of directors to serve as his replacement. In April 2011, the film was given a scheduled release date of August 17, 2012 and a teaser poster for the film was released at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. In June 2011, Simon West was confirmed as director.|$|E

500|$|In a January 2014 {{interview}} with Kerrang! magazine, Manson described {{the sound of}} the album as being [...] "very cinematic", saying that the [...] "redneck in me comes <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> voice" [...] owing to the album's inclusion of blues influences, while still retaining the harder elements of previous work. The album has been compared to the music which was used to soundtrack Sons of Anarchy. Manson called himself [...] "a man of few words" [...] , opting to allow melody to be its primary focus, instead of using characters or extended metaphors to compose lyrics. Lyrics for the album were all derived from a single notebook, with Manson admitting that the content of previous work was too scattered, as they were composed of material taken from up to 20 different notebooks. He has described it as being intentionally sparse lyrically, elaborating that blues music stems from the [...] "guttural, visceral element of music. I [...] holes in these stories so it becomes your story, it becomes more cinematic. For example in the film Rosemary's Baby, you don't see the baby but in your mind you do." ...|$|E
500|$|Mulholland Drive {{has been}} {{compared}} with Billy Wilder's film noir classic Sunset Boulevard (1950), another tale about broken dreams in Hollywood, and early in the film Rita is shown crossing Sunset Boulevard at night. Apart from both titles being named after iconic Los Angeles streets, Mulholland Drive is [...] "Lynch's unique account of what held Wilder's attention too: human putrefaction (a term Lynch used several times during his press conference at the New York Film Festival 2001) {{in a city of}} lethal illusions". The title of the film is a reference to iconic Hollywood culture. David Lynch lives near Mulholland Drive, and stated in an interview, [...] "At night, you ride {{on the top of the}} world. In the daytime you ride on top of the world, too, but it's mysterious, and there's a hair of fear because it goes into remote areas. You feel the history of Hollywood in that road." [...] Watts also had experience with the road before her career was established: [...] "I remember driving along the street many times sobbing my heart <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> car, going, 'What am I doing here? ...|$|E

My {{position on this}} question is clearly spelled <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> most recent book: [...] "The plain fact is that at present there exists no scientifically satisfactory explanation for {{the differences between the}} IQ distributions in the black and white populations. The only genuine consensus among well-informed scientists on this topic is that the cause of the difference remains an open question." [...] (Jensen, 1981a, p. 213).|$|E
2500|$|In a 2002 {{interview}} with Anthony DeCurtis, Tweedy noted that, {{of all of}} the songs that Uncle Tupelo recorded throughout their career, [...] "Sandusky" [...] holds a special place for him:"Sandusky" [...] is probably the track that I'm most proud of. [...] It's an instrumental, it was a real collaboration and it just kind of came out of us in the studio, real improvised natural music, very simple. I think it's beautiful. [...] I also don't feel I was that much a part of it, because it just happened, and maybe that makes it easier to listen to it. That's the one that sticks <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind the most.|$|E

It's taken me years to sort <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> head what I want - who I want - and today I did. I'm staying with you, for all the time I have left.

2500|$|Hopper paid {{particular}} attention to geometrical design and the careful placement of human figures in proper balance with their environment. He was a slow and methodical artist; as he wrote, [...] "It {{takes a long time}} for an idea to strike. Then I {{have to think about it}} for a long time. I don't start painting until I have it all worked <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind. I'm all right when I get to the easel". He often made preparatory sketches to work out his carefully calculated compositions. He and his wife kept a detailed ledger of their works noting such items as [...] "sad face of woman unlit", [...] "electric light from ceiling", and [...] "thighs cooler".|$|E
2500|$|Rameau pursued his {{activities}} as a theorist and composer until his death. He {{lived with his}} wife and two of his children in his large suite of rooms in Rue des Bons-Enfants, which he would leave every day, lost in thought, to take a solitary walk in the nearby gardens of the Palais-Royal or the Tuileries. Sometimes he would meet the young writer Chabanon, who noted some of Rameau's disillusioned confidential remarks: [...] "Day by day, I'm acquiring more good taste, but I no longer have any genius" [...] and [...] "The imagination is worn <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> old head; it's not wise at this age wanting to practise arts that are nothing but imagination." ...|$|E
2500|$|Paul Weitz {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the story of Grandma long before he began writing the script. He never completed the story until he had met and worked with Tomlin on the 2013 film Admission, saying that [...] "After meeting Lily, the voice and the character really clicked, I had thought about it for years, so I had a lot of it worked <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> head, and then I just went to a coffee shop and wrote it longhand." [...] He said that, as he wrote, he could hear her [...] "performing it in [...] head". After writing the script, he was afraid to present it to Tomlin in case she turned down the lead role. Tomlin said that she immediately connected with the character and the story; she and Weitz then spent several months editing the script together. The film marked Tomlin's first leading role in 27 years, after co-starring with Bette Midler in the 1988 comedy film Big Business.|$|E

2500|$|After stumps, with Australia at 4/254, Ponting {{was happy}} with his performance, [...] "I'm as pleased with that innings as I {{probably}} have been with any innings I've ever played," [...] he said. [...] "I'd played eight Tests here before with a highest score of 60, so I had some work to do. I had a point to prove to a few people as well. It was satisfying today." [...] I've been working really hard," [...] Ponting said on his technique. [...] "I've {{made no secret of}} it, my record here has been poor. Today is one step in the right direction. It was nice to get some runs out there and put the team in a good position. But one innings doesn't make a tour. The other tours I've had here, apart from the last Test I played, I've batted at six, always coming in against spin and when the wicket has worn. One thing that stands <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> career is whenever I've been in early, with the team in a bit of trouble, I've managed to make runs." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wilson avoided {{standard}} rock percussion {{because he}} wanted his productions to sound more [...] "delicate" [...] and less [...] "boomy". Van Dyke Parks said: [...] "The first thing I can remember in the studio was how Brian used tuneful percussion, like a piano or a Chinese gong. Even a triangle has pitch. Brian was very fond of pitched instruments. They {{reminded me of the}} orchestrations of the early 20th century done by people like Percy Grainger, the man who wrote 'Country Gardens', who was infatuated with tuneful percussion. He stood <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> youth as a great composer because of what he did with sound, and Brian was doing that." [...] Arranger Paul Mertens believes: [...] "There are string sections on Pet Sounds. But to me, what's special about that is not that Brian was trying to introduce classical music into rock & roll. Rather, {{he was trying to get}} classical musicians to play like rock musicians. He's using these things to make music in the way that he understood, rather than trying to appropriate the orchestra. Often he'll direct a drummer to play in a very unconventional way, in a way that drummers don't normally play. He'll say, 'No, no, don't play the hi-hat, just go bomp...ba-domp...bomp...ba-domp on the tom and kick drum.' He's feeling a certain thing, but coming at it from a musical idea rather than the conventions of the instrument." [...] One of Wilson's favorite techniques was to apply reverb exclusively to a timpani, as can be heard in [...] "Wouldn't It Be Nice", [...] "You Still Believe in Me", and [...] "Don't Talk".|$|E
2500|$|The family divided {{their time}} between the Villa Meridiana, an {{experimental}} floriculture station which also served as their home, and Mario's ancestral land at San Giovanni Battista. On this small working farm set in the hills behind San Remo, Mario pioneered in the cultivation of then exotic fruits such as avocado and grapefruit, eventually obtaining an entry in the Dizionario biografico degli italiani for his achievements. The vast forests and luxuriant fauna omnipresent in Calvino's early fiction such as The Baron in the Trees derives from this [...] "legacy". In an interview, Calvino stated that [...] "San Remo continues to pop <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> books, in the most diverse pieces of writing." [...] He and Floriano would climb the tree-rich estate and perch for hours on the branches reading their favorite adventure stories. Less salubrious aspects of this [...] "paternal legacy" [...] are described in The Road to San Giovanni, Calvino's memoir of his father in which he exposes their inability to communicate: [...] "Talking to each other was difficult. Both verbose by nature, possessed of an ocean of words, in each other's presence we became mute, would walk in silence side by side {{along the road to}} San Giovanni." [...] A fan of Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book as a child, Calvino felt that his early interest in stories made him the [...] "black sheep" [...] of a family that held literature in less esteem than the sciences. Fascinated by American movies and cartoons, he was equally attracted to drawing, poetry, and theatre. On a darker note, Calvino recalled that his earliest memory was of a Marxist professor who had been brutally assaulted by Benito Mussolini's Blackshirts: [...] "I remember clearly that we were at dinner when the old professor came in with his face beaten up and bleeding, his bowtie all torn, asking for help." ...|$|E
