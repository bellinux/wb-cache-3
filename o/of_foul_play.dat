5|$|After Brokeback Mountain {{lost the}} Academy Award for Best Picture to Crash, many accused the Academy of {{homophobia}} and {{for making a}} non-groundbreaking choice, and commentators including Kenneth Turan and Nikki Finke derided the Academy's decision. However, Roger Ebert argued that claims <b>of</b> <b>foul</b> <b>play</b> were unjustified and that the better film won.|$|E
5|$|After Kamo's {{release from}} prison, {{he worked in}} the Soviet customs office, by some {{accounts}} because he was too unstable to work for the secret police. He died in 1922 when a truck hit him while he was cycling. Although there is no proof <b>of</b> <b>foul</b> <b>play,</b> some have theorized that Stalin ordered his death to keep him quiet.|$|E
5|$|An autopsy was {{performed}} on August 16, 1983, {{but was unable to}} determine cause of death. New Haven police investigated the death, but were unable to find evidence <b>of</b> <b>foul</b> <b>play.</b> In November 1983, the office of the Connecticut state medical examiner issued a report stating that Slee's death may have been related to stress. The police investigation into the matter was closed the same month.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the initial}} {{suspicion}} <b>of</b> <b>foul</b> <b>play,</b> the death was ruled an accident; {{a case of}} starvation and exposure as Barker was unable to escape the closet. Investigators concluded that Barker died on February 28, three days after her disappearance. As a result, the mayor ordered closet doors to open more easily. The press surrounding the Barker case also led to the first calls about the Boy in the Box.|$|E
5|$|Mary Celeste {{was built}} in Spencer's Island, Nova Scotia, and {{launched}} under British registration as Amazon, in 1861. She transferred to American ownership and registration in 1868, when she acquired her new name, and thereafter sailed uneventfully until her 1872 voyage. At the salvage hearings in Gibraltar, following her recovery, the court's officers considered various possibilities <b>of</b> <b>foul</b> <b>play,</b> including mutiny by Mary Celestes crew, piracy by the Dei Gratia crew or others, and conspiracy to carry out insurance or salvage fraud. No convincing evidence supported these theories, but unresolved suspicions led to a relatively low salvage award.|$|E
5|$|Other {{theories}} <b>of</b> <b>foul</b> <b>play</b> {{have suggested}} {{an attack by}} Riffian pirates, who were active {{off the coast of}} Morocco in the 1870s. Charles Edey Fay, in his 1942 account, observes that pirates would have looted the ship, yet the personal possessions of captain and crew, some of significant value, were left undisturbed. In 1925, the historian John Gilbert Lockhart surmised that Briggs, in a fit of a religious mania, had slaughtered all on board and then killed himself. In a later edition of his book Lockhart, who had by then spoken to Briggs's descendants, apologized and withdrew this theory.|$|E

5|$|Several German art {{experts have}} {{attempted}} to refute all the claims made by Hawass, pointing to the 1924 document discussing the pact between Borchardt and the Egyptian authorities, though, as discussed earlier, Borchardt has been accused <b>of</b> <b>foul</b> <b>play</b> in the deal. The German authorities have also argued the bust is too fragile to transport and that the legal arguments for the repatriation were insubstantial. According to The Times, Germany may be concerned that lending the bust to Egypt would mean its permanent departure from Germany.|$|E

In his last moments, the demon accuses Vishnu <b>of</b> <b>foul</b> <b>play</b> saying that Vishnu first seduced him and then {{attacked}} him. Vishnu decrees that in his next birth, Nontok will be born as the ten-headed demon Ravana and Vishnu will be a mortal man called Rama. He will then fight him and defeat him.|$|E

5|$|During the study, various accusations <b>of</b> <b>foul</b> <b>play</b> by or unsuitability of both {{submarine}} designers {{were made}} by Australian politicians and the media. These included claims that the similar left-wing political leanings of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Swedish Social Democratic Party, both in power at the time, {{would lead to a}} pro-Kockums bias, investigations into perceived coaching of IDL/HDW representatives in the questions to be asked at an ALP Caucus briefing session on the project, and public emphasis on security incidents in both Sweden and West Germany. These incidents either lacked supporting evidence or were proven false, and were the result of the Liberal Party attempting to discredit the Labor government, or pro-British politicians and organisations who believed both submarines were inferior to the Vickers Type 2400offering.|$|E
5|$|The {{submarines}} {{have been}} the subject of many incidents and technical problems since the design phase, including accusations <b>of</b> <b>foul</b> <b>play</b> and bias during the design selection, improper handling of design changes during construction, major capability deficiencies in the first submarines, and ongoing technical problems throughout the early life of the class. These problems have been compounded by the inability of the RAN to retain sufficient personnel to operate the submarines—by 2008, only three could be manned, and between 2009 and 2012, on average two or fewer were fully operational. The resulting negative press has led to a poor public perception of the Collins class.|$|E
5|$|Hitsugaya {{lived with}} his {{grandmother}} and with Momo Hinamori, whom he considers a very close friend. Hitsugaya excelled in the Soul Reaper academy, becoming the youngest captain {{in the history of}} Soul Society with command over Squad 10. Introduced to the Gotei 13, Hitsugaya suspected Squad 3 captain Gin Ichimaru <b>of</b> <b>foul</b> <b>play</b> as the circumstances surrounding the coming execution of Rukia Kuchiki become more complicated. When Hinamori is manipulated into thinking that Hitsugaya killed Sōsuke Aizen, Hitsugaya attacks Gin on the notion that he tricked her. The fight is interrupted when Hitsugaya dodges an attack that almost kills Hinamori, only to be intercepted by his lieutenant Rangiku Matsumoto. Seeing how destructive Rukia's execution is becoming, Hitsugaya tries to stop it by appealing to the Chamber 46, only to discover all members were murdered by Aizen, who faked his death. When Hitsugaya discovers Hinamori injured, Hitsugaya tries to kill Aizen but is defeated.|$|E

5|$|Levy {{was last}} seen on May 1, 2001. The Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia was first alerted on May 6, when Levy's parents called from Modesto to report {{that they had not}} heard from their {{daughter}} in five days. Police called hospitals and visited Levy's apartment in Dupont Circle that day, finding no indication <b>of</b> <b>foul</b> <b>play.</b> On May 7, Levy's father told the police that his daughter had been {{having an affair with a}} U.S. congressman, and said the next day that he believed the congressman to be U.S. Representative Gary Condit. Levy's aunt also called the police and told them that Chandra had confided in her about the affair. Police obtained a warrant on May 10 to conduct a formal search of Levy's apartment. Investigators found her credit cards, identification and mobile phone left behind in her purse, along with partially packed suitcases. The answering machine was full, with messages left by her relatives and two from Condit. A police sergeant tried to examine Levy's laptop computer and inadvertently corrupted the internet search data, as he was not a trained technician.|$|E

40|$|Impact <b>of</b> ballast <b>fouling</b> on {{rail tracks}} Ballast fouling is {{understood}} as major cause of track deterioration in many countries over the world. It decreases the drainage and load bearing capacity of the ballast layer. A series of large scale hydraulic conductivity tests were conducted with different proportions <b>of</b> <b>fouling</b> to access the drainage capacity of the track. A numerical analysis was conducted using SEEP/W to quantify the drainage capacity of ballast under different degrees <b>of</b> <b>fouling.</b> Subsequently, track drainage classification {{in relation to the}} degree <b>of</b> <b>fouling,</b> which is a very useful tool for practical engineers, is presented in this paper. The analysis showed that both the location and extent <b>of</b> <b>fouling</b> <b>played</b> an important role when assessing the overall drainage capacity of track. In order to establish the relationship between the extent <b>of</b> <b>fouling</b> and the associated strength-deformation properties, a series of large scale monotonic triaxial tests were carried out for different levels <b>of</b> <b>fouling</b> for three different confining pressures.
