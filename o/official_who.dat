5|$|Odaenathus {{controlled}} a {{large area}} of the Roman East and held the highest political and military authority in the region, superseding that of the Roman provincial governors. His self-created status was formalized by Emperor Gallienus, who {{had little choice but}} to acquiesce. Odaenathus's power relative to that of the emperor and the central authority was unprecedented and elastic, but relations remained smooth until his death. His assassination meant that the Palmyrene rulers' authority and position had to be clarified, which led to a conflict over their interpretation. The Roman court viewed Odaenathus as an appointed Roman <b>official</b> <b>who</b> derived his power from the emperor, but the Palmyrene court saw his position as hereditary. This conflict was the first step on the road to war between Rome and Palmyra.|$|E

On the basis of landholding, it has been speculated that Pain's mother was a daughter of Ralph Mortimer, who held Wigmore in Domesday Book. As well as being a moneyer, Pain's paternal grandfather, who came from near Avranches in Normandy, owned a mill. Pain's brother, Eustace fitzJohn, became a royal <b>official</b> <b>who</b> owned lands {{in the north of}} England. His other siblings included William, Alice and Agnes. William was {{probably the}} same William who later held Harptree in Somerset, and in 1130 was a royal justice in western England.

In 1873, the first monograph of the detailed study of Borobudur was published, followed by its French translation a year later.
