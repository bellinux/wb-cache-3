500|$|Philip Morris {{issued a}} {{statement}} which read in part: On February 15, 2015, the 'Last Week Tonight with John Oliver' show dedicated {{a significant portion of}} its program to <b>our</b> <b>company</b> ... Last Week Tonight with John Oliver is a parody show, known for getting a laugh through exaggeration and presenting partial views in the name of humor. The segment includes many mischaracterizations of <b>our</b> <b>company,</b> including our approach to marketing and regulation, which have been embellished in the spirit of comedic license ... While we recognize the tobacco industry is an easy target for comedians, we take seriously the responsibility that comes with selling a product that is an adult choice and is harmful to health ... We support and comply with thousands of regulations worldwide — including advertising restrictions, penalties for selling tobacco products to minors, and substantial health warnings on packaging. We're investing billions into developing and scientifically assessing a portfolio of products that have the potential to be less harmful and that are satisfying so smokers will switch to them. And, like any other company with a responsibility to its business partners, shareholders and employees, we ask only that laws protecting investments, including trademarks, be equally applied to us.|$|E

The document, signed by Heidemann, finished with a veiled threat: [...] "If <b>our</b> <b>company</b> thinks that the risk is too great, I suggest that I should seek out a publishing company in the United States which could put up the money and ensure that we get the German publication rights." [...] The pair did not show the prospectus to anyone at Stern, but instead presented it to Gruner + Jahr's deputy managing director, Dr Jan Hensmann, and Manfred Fischer; they also requested a 200,000mark deposit from the publisher to secure the rights with Kujau. After a meeting that lasted {{a little over two}} hours, and with no recourse to an expert or historian, the deposit was authorised. As soon as the meeting ended, at about 7pm, Heidemann travelled to Stuttgart, with the deposit money, to meet Kujau.|$|E

Mackendrick remembered seeing audience members [...] "curling up, crossing their arms and legs, recoiling from the screen in disgust". Burt Lancaster's fans were not thrilled with their idol either, [...] "finding the film too static and talky". The film was a box office failure, and Hecht blamed his producing partner Hill. [...] "The night of the preview, Harold said to me, 'You know you've wrecked <b>our</b> <b>company?</b> We're going to lose {{over a million dollars}} on this picture,'" [...] Hill recalled. However, Lancaster blamed Lehman, who remembers a confrontation they had: [...] "Burt threatened me at a party after the preview.

[...] A spokesman for Rebecca Black said her legal team had asked YouTube to take the video down because of an ongoing legal dispute with the song's producers Ark Music Factory. Ark Music Factory responded by saying it was disappointed that Black decided to have the video pulled from YouTube despite the two parties being in [...] "good faith negotiations". It added: [...] "There's been an ongoing, open dialogue with <b>our</b> <b>company.</b> So we were blindsided to get a 'Take Down Notice' alleging copyright infringement instead of a call or e-mail from Rebecca's representatives. Our use of the video has fully been authorized (as evidenced by four uninterrupted months and 160 million-plus viewings without objection) by both Ms. Black and the copyright holder. Regardless, {{we are going to continue}} to take the high road and work out the complaint as soon as possible, so that the million-plus people who watch Friday for free each day can continue to enjoy the video."

2500|$|During 1559 the Lords of the Congregation {{dominated}} most {{of central}} Scotland and entered Edinburgh, forcing Mary of Guise {{to retreat to}} Dunbar Castle. However, {{with the aid of}} 2,000 French troops, she regained control of the capital in July. A short-lived truce was made with the Articles of Leith on 25 July 1559. Guise received further military aid from France, thanks to the influence of Jacques de la Brosse and the Bishop of Amiens. The Lords considered this assistance a breach of the Leith articles. Châtellerault wrote to summon other Scottish lords at the start of October 1559 to resolve their situation: ...it is not unknawin how the Franchmen hes begun mair nor 20 dayis to fortifie the toun of Leyth, tending thairthrow to expell the inhabitantis thairoff and plant thame selffis, thair wyffis and bairnis thairintill suppressing the libertie of this realme. Mary of Guise responded to these letters by making a proclamation on 2 October and writing to Lord Seton, Provost of Edinburgh, that it was well known that Leith was fortified {{as a response to the}} Congregation's intent to come in arms to Edinburgh on 8 October 1559, rather than to accommodate French troops and their families.

2500|$|During this time, European {{settlement}} accelerated, and in 1859 {{the number}} of Pākehā came to equal {{the number of}} Māori, at around 60,000 each. Settlers were keen to obtain land and some Māori were willing to sell, {{but there were also}} strong pressures to retain land - in particular from the Māori King Movement. Grey had to manage the demand for land for the settlers to farm and the commitments in the Treaty of Waitangi that the Māori chiefs retained full [...] "exclusive and undisturbed possession of their Lands and Estates Forests Fisheries and other properties." [...] The treaty also specifies that Māori will sell land only to the Crown. The potential for conflict between the Māori and settlers was exacerbated as the British authorities progressively eased restrictions on land sales after an agreement at the end of 1840 between the company and Colonial Secretary Lord John Russell, which provided for land purchases by the New Zealand Company from the Crown at a discount price, and a charter to buy and sell land under government supervision. Money raised by the government from sales to the company would be spent on assisting migration to New Zealand. The agreement was hailed by the company as [...] "all that we could desire ... <b>our</b> <b>Company</b> is really to be the agent of the state for colonizing NZ." [...] The Government waived its right of pre-emption in the Wellington region, Wanganui and New Plymouth in September 1841.|$|E
