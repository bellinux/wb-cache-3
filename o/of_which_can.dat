5|$|Ancient Trader is a turn-based {{strategy}} {{video game}} played from a two-dimensional perspective. The player controls a ship and seeks out three artifacts {{to defeat the}} game's final boss, a sea creature called the Ancient Guardian. The player explores the map to gather items, including tea, spices, and fruit, all <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>can</b> be found in wrecks. These can be exchanged for gold, {{which can be used}} to buy upgrades for the ship. The commodities are stored in the cargo hold, the capacity <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>can</b> be upgraded with gold.|$|E

5|$|All ports {{have been}} {{replaced}} with either two or four combination USB-C 3.1 ports that support Thunderbolt 3 and dual DisplayPort 1.2 signals, any <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>can</b> be used for charging. The MacBook Pro is incompatible with some older Thunderbolt 3 certified peripherals, including Intel's own reference design for Thunderbolt 3 devices. Furthermore, MacOS on MacBook Pro blocks certain classes of Thunderbolt 3 compatible devices from working by blacklisting them. Devices using HDMI, previous generation Thunderbolt, and USB will require an adapter to connect to the MacBook Pro. The models come with a 3.5 mm headphone jack, although TOSLINK functionality of older generation MacBook Pros has been removed.|$|E

5|$|Amanita ocreata {{is highly}} toxic, {{and has been}} {{responsible}} for mushroom poisonings in western North America, particularly in the spring. It contains highly toxic amatoxins, as well as phallotoxins, a feature shared with the closely related death cap (A. phalloides), half a cap <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>can</b> be enough to kill a human, and other species known as destroying angels. There is some evidence it may be the most toxic of all the North American phalloideae, as a higher proportion of people consuming it had organ damage and 40% perished. Dogs have also been known to consume this fungus in California with fatal results.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} rover and its {{bridging}} kits, Jetman {{has access to}} three other pieces of equipment, all <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>can</b> be carried on the bonnet of the rover, albeit one at a time. Bombs must be used to destroy alien bases when they are encountered, {{which can only be}} accomplished when Jetman is flying above them. Another piece of equipment is a cannon that may be mounted onto the rear side of the moon rover. The final piece of equipment is a pair of teleporters which can be used to instantaneously transport the player to the teleporter's twin, thus allowing rapid transport around the moon.|$|E
5|$|Banksia grossa is {{cultivated}} for its attractive needle-like {{leaves and}} rusty-brown flower spikes, both <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>can</b> be quite variable in colour. This species favours well-drained sandy or loamy acidic soils with a pH of 5.5 to 7, and a sunny aspect. Once established, it tolerates dry spells. It can be pruned heavily as it resprouts from its lignotuber.|$|E

5|$|Casualties in {{the battle}} are {{notoriously}} hard to calculate exactly. With only one exception (Scipion), records made by the French captains of their losses at the time are incomplete. The only immediately available casualty counts are the sketchy reports of Saint-André and the records made by British officers aboard the captured ships, neither <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>can</b> be treated as completely reliable. Most sources accept that French casualties in the campaign numbered approximately 7,000, including around 3,000captured, but these figures are vague and frequently {{do not agree with}} each other on details. British casualties are easier to confirm but here, too, there are some discrepancies; overall British casualties are generally given as around 1,200.|$|E
5|$|Craters of the Moon Campground has 51 sites– none <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>can</b> be {{reserved}} in advance. Camping facilities are basic but do include water, restrooms, charcoal grills, and trash containers. National Park Service rangers present evening {{programs at the}} campground amphitheater in the summer. Camping enables visitors to enjoy the park during the evening and morning, when the heat, glare and wind are far less.|$|E
5|$|Croatia has a {{universal}} health care system, the roots <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>can</b> {{be traced back to}} the Hungarian-Croatian Parliament Act of 1891, providing a form of mandatory insurance for all factory workers and craftsmen. The population is covered by a basic health insurance plan provided by statute and optional insurance. In 2014, the annual compulsory healthcare related expenditures reached 21.8billion kuna (2.9billion euro). Healthcare expenditures comprise only 0.6% of private health insurance and public spending. In 2010, Croatia spent 6.9% of its GDP on healthcare, representing a decline from approximately 8% estimated in 2008, when 84% of healthcare spending came from public sources. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Croatia ranks around the 50th in the world in terms of life expectancy.|$|E

5|$|During the Bronze Age (about 1500 BC) tribes {{sometimes}} called the Urn people started to settle in the area. They built numerous stone circles, examples <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>can</b> be found on Moscar Moor, Froggatt Edge and Hordron Edge (Hordron Edge stone circle). Two Early Bronze Age urns were found at Crookes in 1887, and three Middle Bronze Age barrows found at Lodge Moor (both suburbs of the modern city).|$|E
5|$|Fewer colours of coat {{appear in}} the Pembroke breed. These include red, sable, tan, fawn and black, each <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>can</b> be with or without white markings.

5|$|Following the Roman Empire's {{invasion}} of southern Britain, the mining of lead and {{silver in the}} Mendip Hills provided a basis for local industry and commerce. Bath became {{the site of a}} major Roman fort and city, the remains <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>can</b> still be seen. During the Early Medieval period Somerset was the scene of battles between the Anglo-Saxons and first the Britons and later the Danes. In this period it was ruled first by various kings of Wessex, and later by kings of England. Following the defeat of the Anglo-Saxon monarchy by the Normans in 1066, castles were built in Somerset.|$|E
