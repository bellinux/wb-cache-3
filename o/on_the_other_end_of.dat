5|$|From {{the time}} Thompson took control until {{shortly after the}} Second World War, the News-Miner lacked a {{dedicated}} connection to the Associated Press.

5|$|Many {{tropical}} cyclones develop {{when the}} atmospheric conditions around a weak disturbance {{in the atmosphere}} are favorable. Others form when other types of cyclones acquire tropical characteristics. Tropical systems are then moved by steering winds in the troposphere; if the conditions remain favorable, the tropical disturbance intensifies, and can even develop an eye. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the spectrum, if the conditions around the system deteriorate or the tropical cyclone makes landfall, the system weakens and eventually dissipates. A tropical cyclone can become extratropical as it moves toward higher latitudes if its energy source changes from heat released by condensation to differences in temperature between air masses. A tropical cyclone is usually not considered to become subtropical during its extratropical transition.|$|E
5|$|On October 25, 1962, {{the section}} of freeway from M-24 near Pontiac to the Flint area opened. The same year, the freeway gap was filled in between Gaylord and Indian River. The International Bridge and its {{approaches}} opened in Sault Ste. Marie on October 31, 1962. The following year, a set of segments opened in the Detroit area. The freeway was extended south from Pontiac to 11Mile Road with a connection along M-150 to M-102 (8Mile Road). Another section opened to connect with US24 (Telegraph Road) in the Woodhaven area; a TO I-75 designation was added to connect along US24 and M-102 to M-150. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the state, the gaps in the freeway across the UP were completed in 1963 as well, and {{the section of}} freeway in Northern Michigan was named the most scenic new highway in the US in 1963 by Parade magazine.

5|$|Virginia Tech {{featured}} {{an unusual}} two-quarterback system on offense, as quarterbacks Sean Glennon and Tyrod Taylor shared time behind center. Though unusual, {{the system was}} successful in leading the Hokies to their second ACC Championship in fouryears. During the 2007regular season, Glennon threw for 1,636yards and 11touchdowns, completing 63percent of his passes. Taylor, meanwhile, passed for 916yards and fivetouchdowns while also rushing for 431yards. Some pundits predicted that Kansas might have difficulty with Taylor's mobility, as his style of play {{was similar to that}} of Missouri's Chase Daniel, who gave Kansas its sole loss of the 2007season. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the Virginia Tech aerial offense was a corps of capable receivers, led by senior wide receivers Eddie Royal and Josh Morgan. Morgan was the fifth-ranked receiver in Virginia Tech history, having earned 1,787receiving yards. Royal was sixth, having earned 1,767yards. Two of Tech's other receivers, Josh Hyman and Justin Harper, recorded 1,138and 1,274receiving yards each, marking the first time in Virginia Tech history that the Hokies had four different thousand-yard career receivers on the same team. On the ground, the Hokies were led by running back Branden Ore, who rushed for 876yards and eighttouchdowns during the regular season. One week before the Orange Bowl, Tech coaches revealed that Ore would be suspended for {{the first quarter of the}} game against Kansas as punishment for showing up late to the Hokies' final pre-bowl practice.
