5|$|The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), {{part of the}} Department of Transportation, {{were the}} primary {{investigators}} into the crash of Flight 2511. The wreckage of the DC-6 {{was taken to a}} hangar at nearby Wilmington Airport, where the fuselage was reassembled on a wood-and-chicken-wire frame. Investigators recovered approximately 90% of the fuselage, which was then assembled <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> in the Wilmington hangar.|$|E
5|$|Further {{depictions of}} Mary {{are found in}} the church background. They include a statue of the Virgin and Child {{positioned}} between two lit candles in the choir screen behind the main figures, and to the right two angels stand in the choir singing her praises (perhaps singing the hymn inscribed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame).</b> Above her is an annunciation relief, and in the recessed bay a relief depicting her coronation; the crucifixion is shown on the rood. Thus, the stages of Mary's life as mother of Jesus are depicted in the painting. A two-column prayer tablet – similar to the one depicted in Rogier van der Weyden's large Seven Sacraments Altarpiece (1445–50) – hangs on a pier to the left. It contains words alluding to and echoing the lines on the original frame. The windows of the clerestory overlook flying buttresses, and cobwebs are visible between the arches of the vault. Several different building phases {{can be seen in the}} arched gallery, while the choral balcony and transept are depicted in a more contemporary style than the nave.|$|E
5|$|The divine {{represented}} by light is a motif {{in keeping with}} the sentiment of both the Latin text on the hem of Mary's dress (which compares her beauty and radiance to that of divine light) and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame.</b> A separate source of light, which also behaves as if from a divine rather than natural source, illuminates her face. The two pools of light behind her have been described as lending the painting a mystical atmosphere, indicating the presence of God. In the niche behind her, the statues are lit by two candles - symbols of the incarnation, whereas she is bathed in natural light. The artificial light adds to the overall illusion of the interior of the church, which Pächt views as achieved mainly through colour.|$|E

5|$|The woman's {{hands are}} crossed tightly {{as if in}} prayer, and {{positioned}} so low in the painting as {{to appear to be}} resting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame.</b> They are rendered as tightly compressed into a small area of the picture; it is likely van der Weyden did not want them to result in an area of high tone that might distract from the description of her head. Her slender fingers are minutely detailed; van der Weyden often indicated the social position of his models through his rendering of their face and hands. The sleeve of her dress extends beyond her wrists. Her fingers are folded in layers; their intricate portrayal is the most detailed element in the painting, and echoes the pyramidal form of the upper portion of the painting.|$|E

25|$|The {{approach}} of Cartan and Weyl, using connection 1-forms <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> bundle of , gives {{a third way}} to understand the Riemannian connection. They noticed that parallel transport dictates that a path in the surface be lifted to a path in the frame bundle so that its tangent vectors lie in a special subspace of codimension one in the three-dimensional tangent space of the frame bundle. The projection onto this subspace is defined by a differential 1-form on the orthonormal frame bundle, the connection form. This enabled the curvature properties of the surface to be encoded in differential forms <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> bundle and formulas involving their exterior derivatives.|$|E
40|$|The {{contribution}} of attribute framing to consumer responses toward products was investigated. <b>The</b> attribute <b>framing,</b> numerical difference <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>framing,</b> {{and level of}} involvement were hypothesized to affect consumer responses. By using fresh milk as the product examined for the study, {{it was found that}} (1) level of involvement affects consumer responses toward framed product information in product packaging, and (2) numerical difference in framed product information significantly affects consumer responses. These results suggest that marketers should capitalize <b>on</b> <b>the</b> influence attribute <b>framing</b> has on consumer responses with consideration on numerical information <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>framing</b> and level of consumer involvement...|$|R

25|$|On any {{manifold}} {{of positive}} dimension there are infinitely many affine connections. If the manifold is further endowed with a Riemannian metric {{then there is}} a natural choice of affine connection, called the Levi-Civita connection. The choice of an affine connection is equivalent to prescribing a way of differentiating vector fields which satisfies several reasonable properties (linearity and the Leibniz rule). This yields a possible definition of an affine connection as a covariant derivative or (linear) connection on the tangent bundle. A choice of affine connection is also equivalent to a notion of parallel transport, which is a method for transporting tangent vectors along curves. This also defines a parallel transport <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> bundle. Infinitesimal parallel transport in the frame bundle yields another description of an affine connection, either as a Cartan connection for the affine group or as a principal connection <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> bundle.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has established that rival issue frames that target competing values can lead {{public opinion in}} different directions.

Both supporters and opponents of <b>the</b> speech <b>framed</b> their positions around free expression and democracy. Such framing influenced judgments about how these values were upheld by permitting versus banning hate speech. These judgments, in turn, affected tolerance for such speech.
