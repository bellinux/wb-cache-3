The airline took its first delivery of this new aircraft in September 2004, with the eighth and final aircraft delivered on 22 June 2006. The new freighters were powered by two General Electric (GE) CF6-80C2 engines and signed a 14-year Maintenance Cost Per Hour (MCPH) programme with GE on 25 January 2005.|$|E

40|$|Sickle is the {{agriculture}} traditional tools which made from hardness steel that usually used to cut grass, twig, clump, etc. In Yogyakarta many farmers still use sickle {{to cut the}} grass manually. This conventional sickle is made by small industry. The weakness of the conventional sickle is on the form and the size <b>of</b> <b>handle.</b> The form and the size <b>of</b> <b>handle</b> is different each other, because the form and the size <b>of</b> <b>handle</b> is measured based on hand of blacksmith. During the survey was found the problem on the existing design <b>of</b> sickle <b>handle.</b> The conventional sickle handle tends to make deflection on the user hand. After do some analyses is {{need to be developed}} the new design <b>of</b> sickle <b>handle.</b> The result <b>of</b> this research is a new design <b>of</b> sickle <b>handle</b> which can reduce or eliminate the deflection on hand. The dimension <b>of</b> sickle <b>handle</b> is adjusted based on the anthropometry data which are measured from the farmer. So the new design <b>of</b> sickle <b>handle</b> can make the farmer work more comfortable. ...|$|R

Observation was conducted within 20 days. After the data was evaluated using Multiple Regression, it is found that the effort, sophistication of the tool and sufficiency of the tool are significant factors that affect time inefftciency in customs clearance <b>of</b> <b>handled</b> container process. Besides, it is proven that effort is the most significant factor that influences time inefftciency in customs clearance <b>of</b> <b>handled</b> container process...|$|R

5|$|Accordingly, {{building}} a new oil terminal in Europe capable <b>of</b> <b>handling</b> the largest vessels that were planned was judged appropriate. The intention was that oil coming from the Middle East would be off-loaded at this terminal and then stored for trans-shipment to European refineries using smaller vessels. The closure of the Suez Canal in 1967 {{as a result of}} the Six-Day War reinforced the economic viability of this scheme. Oil shipments had to come round the Cape of Good Hope, thus avoiding the vessel size constraints previously imposed by the canal.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the airport}} is capable <b>of</b> <b>handling</b> Boeing 767 aircraft, for large numbers of these aircraft, {{significant}} investment would be needed. Consequently, the largest aircraft regularly flying to the airport are Boeing 757. The main problem at {{the airport is}} the lack of ramp space, with just two parking positions for large aircraft. As a result, El Al operates regular shuttle flights to Ben Gurion International Airport carrying passengers from around the world on 757s and 737s.|$|E

5|$|After {{the first}} solo flights glider pilots are {{required}} to stay within gliding range of their home airfield. In addition to solo flying, further flights are made with an instructor until the student is capable of taking a glider cross-country and <b>of</b> <b>handling</b> more difficult weather. Cross-country flights are allowed when they have sufficient experience to find sources of lift away from their home airfield, to navigate, and to select and land in a field if necessary. In most countries pilots must take a written examination on the regulations, navigation, use of the radio, weather, principles of flight and human factors. Proposals are being made to standardise the training requirements across European countries.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{introduction}} of the crossbar, teams could play without a goalkeeper. The first reference to a goalkeeper appears in the report of the Battle of Bramall Lane in 1862. The position, however, was used as an alternative to sending off a player. Although a recognised position goalkeeper sometimes was also referred to in the rules as the player nearest their own goal (allowing him the luxury <b>of</b> <b>handling</b> the ball). Unlike its FA counterpart Sheffield Rules never restricted handling to one designated player. Despite this by the 1870s teams usually featured a single player in the position.|$|E
5|$|Bradley Meek, {{writing for}} THEM Anime, gave the series 3/5 stars. He praised {{the way the}} series {{maintained}} its horror-based atmosphere in between the action sequences.

Running along each side of the bed were seven-foot (2.1 m) pull shafts ending with a three-foot (0.9m) crossbar at the front. The crossbar allowed the carts to be pushed or pulled. Cargo was carried in a box about three feet by four feet (0.9m by 1.2m), with 8inch (0.2m) walls. The handcarts generally carried up to 250 pounds (110kg) of supplies and luggage, though they were capable <b>of</b> <b>handling</b> loads as heavy as 500 pounds (230kg). Carts used in the first year's migration were made entirely of wood ("Iowa hickory or oak"); in later years a stronger design was substituted, which included metal elements.|$|E

5|$|Construction of the {{memorial}} began in 1928 with the cut and placement of marble blocks from Macclesfield and Angaston. The South Australian Monumental Works {{were chosen to}} work on the construction, with Alan Tillett as the principal. Although no sculptor was named in the winning proposal, it did make mention of a possible candidate—who later proved to be Rayner Hoff, a Sydney-based sculptor born in England. Rayner Hoff produced the designs for the sculptures from his Sydney studio, with the bronze castings from Hoff's plaster models being produced by the South Australian firm A. W. Dobbie and Company. (Hoff had expressed reservations that a South Australian company would be capable <b>of</b> <b>handling</b> bronzes of the required size, but a test casting of the lion's head from {{the memorial}} was sufficient to overcome his concerns). The two angel reliefs sculpted from the Angaston marble were produced by Julius Henschke in situ from Hoff's designs, expressed through one-third sized plaster models which Henschke then scaled to suit.|$|E

Dirks wrote the initial code for the NUPACK suite of nucleic acid design and analysis tools, which generates base pairing probabilities through calculation of the statistical partition function. Unlike other structure prediction tools, NUPACK is capable <b>of</b> <b>handling</b> an arbitrary number of interacting strands rather than being limited to one or two. Dirks also developed an algorithm capable of efficiently handling certain types of pseudoknots, a class of structure that is more computationally intensive to analyze, although NUPACK only implements this ability for single RNA strands.|$|E
