The purpose of this field project was to identify the financial and operational impact on the City of Oshkosh if it merges its emergency <b>operations</b> <b>center</b> with the emergency <b>operations</b> <b>center</b> of Winnebago County. The descriptive research approach was utilized to guide the following research questions: (a) What are the guidelines for maintaining an emergency <b>operations</b> <b>center</b> within a city of comparable size to the City of Oshkosh? (b) What, if any, Wisconsin cities, similar in size to the City of Oshkosh have their own emergency <b>operations</b> <b>center,</b> or are combined with their county's emergency <b>operations</b> <b>center?</b> (c) What, if any, process of the City of Oshkosh's emergency <b>operations</b> <b>center</b> with Winnebago County's?

Several media releases of information were issued regarding the storm. The State Emergency <b>Operation</b> <b>Center</b> was on Level 2, or partial activation, and the state government organized two conferences to discuss county actions in regards to the storm.

25|$|Though {{it varies}} by country, {{generally}} peacetime {{law in the}} 20th and 21st centuries has not allowed merchant vessels to carry weapons. As {{a response to the}} rise in modern piracy, however, the U.S. government changed its rules so that it is now possible for U.S.-flagged vessels to embark a team of armed private security guards. The US Coastguard leaves it to ship owners' discretion to determine if those guards will be armed. The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) in 2011 changed its stance on private armed guards, accepting that operators must be able to defend their ships against pirate attacks. This has given birth to a new breed of private security companies that provide training for crew members and operate floating armouries for protection of crew and cargo; this has proved effective in countering pirate attacks. The use of floating armouries in international waters allows ships to carry weapons in international waters, without being in possession of arms within coastal waters where they would be illegal. Seychelles has become a central location for international anti-piracy operations, hosting the Anti-Piracy <b>Operation</b> <b>Center</b> for the Indian Ocean. In 2008, VSOS became the first authorized armed maritime security company to operate in the Indian Ocean region.|$|E
