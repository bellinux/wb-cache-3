5|$|A Hind in Richmond Park by William Henry Hudson, {{published}} in 1922 and re{{published in}} 2006, is an extended natural history essay. It includes {{an account of}} his visits to Richmond Park and a particular <b>occasion</b> <b>when</b> a young girl {{was struck by a}} red deer when she tried to feed it an acorn.|$|E
5|$|In 1910 Yeats {{thought his}} {{horoscope}} suggested {{a return to}} Olivia; he distanced himself from Maud and in June began to see Olivia more frequently. Pound was fond of Olivia, which may have caused Yeats some jealousy as when, for example, Pound met the two at the theatre and took them afterward to tea—an <b>occasion</b> <b>when</b> Yeats was extremely rude to Pound. A year later, Olivia introduced Yeats to Georgie Hyde-Lees, her 18-year-old step-niece and Dorothy's best friend, whom Yeats eventually married.|$|E
5|$|In 1531 Peter IV Rareş invaded Poland {{in order}} to reoccupy the Pocuţia region (in modern Ukraine), but his army was defeated. Now he {{concluded}} a secret treaty with Ferdinand I of Hungary, but soon had to seek refugee in Transylvania when Suleiman I led an army against him. This was the first <b>occasion</b> <b>when</b> a prince, Stephen V Lăcustă (15381540) was appointed by the sultan. At the same time, the sultan occupied Brăila and Tighina (now in Moldova), and the Budjak region (now in Ukraine). Peter IV Rareş recovered his throne {{in exchange for a}} large sum of money in 1541. His death was followed by a period characterized by fights between pretenders to the throne and among the boyar parties.|$|E

5|$|Qimei was a practising Buddhist, and {{encouraged}} her sons to follow Buddhist teachings; embracing this faith, Zedong often accompanied her on {{visits to the}} local Buddhist temple, influencing her hopes that he would become a monk. Conversely, Yichang was largely irreligious, although after surviving an encounter with a tiger, gave offerings to the gods in thanks. According to Mao's account, Yichang was a staunch disciplinarian, and would beat his children as punishment for disobedience and a perceived lack of filial piety, with Mao describing the beating he received on one <b>occasion</b> <b>when</b> he humiliated his father in public. He added that his mother would often try to protect her children from these beatings.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the main}} puppet cast to feature in the film, such as Scott Tracy, were re-made from the {{original}} marionettes, while previously unseen characters such as the Zero-X astronauts, Cliff Richard and the bandmembers of The Shadows were sculpted especially. Whereas guest star puppets for Series One had been recycled for each appearance and moulded in Plasticine, since {{this was the first}} <b>occasion</b> <b>when</b> puppets in an AP Films production were intended to represent real-life celebrities, most of the supporting puppets were made from fibreglass to the same standards of workmanship as the main puppets.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the years, {{accounting}} for ties and repeat winners, the Government of Kerala has presented {{a total of}} 49 Best Actress awards to 33 different actresses. Urvashi {{has been the most}} frequent winner in this category, with five awards. She is followed by Sheela and Srividya with three awards each. As of 2017, eight actressesJayabharathi, Seema, Samyuktha Varma, Suhasini Maniratnam, Navya Nair, Meera Jasmine, Kavya Madhavan and Shweta Menonhave won the award two times in their careers. The 2005 ceremony was the only <b>occasion</b> <b>when</b> the category was tied; Kavya Madhavan and Geetu Mohandas shared the award for their performances in Perumazhakkalam, and Akale and Oridam respectively. Rajisha Vijayan, the most recent recipient, was awarded for her debut film Anuraga Karikkin Vellam (2016).|$|E

5|$|While on {{the move}} the lead {{vehicles}} of the patrol commanders and sergeants flew a small flag. Because the LRP was organised on divisional cavalry lines the leaders carried green flags for 'A' (HQ) Troop, black for 'B' Troop, yellow for 'C' Troop and red for 'D'. When the LRDG was organised into 11 vehicle patrols this was simplified to a green flag displaying the patrol letter in white; the later half-patrols used a plain green flag on <b>occasion.</b> <b>When</b> it became necessary to change course from an intended route, or {{in the event of}} enemy action, patrol movements were controlled by a simple semaphore flag system using blue and white signal flags, or hand signals, depending on how widely dispersed the trucks were.|$|E
5|$|Another {{controversy}} {{surrounds the}} sole {{survivor of the}} flight, a Czech officer, Eduard Prchal. Prchal, like many pilots who {{did not wish to}} tempt fate was known for never wearing his Mae West life jacket — but on this <b>occasion,</b> <b>when</b> rescued from the sea, he was wearing one. During the inquiry he denied this, and later blamed the inconsistency on post-crash shock affecting his actions and memory – essentially, on amnesia. Later he explained that he must have instinctively put the vest on when he realised the plane was in trouble. Polish aviation expert Jerzy Maryniak created a simulation of the crash, in which he concluded that the plane must have been under control up until the very moment of the crash. Kisielewski argues that the plane was likely {{under the control of the}} second pilot, who died in the crash.|$|E
5|$|Brashear is the {{youngest}} of three children born to an African-American father, Johnny Brashear, and French Canadian mother, Nicole Gauthier, in Bedford, Indiana. His father was an alcoholic who relentlessly abused his family, including slashing Donald with belts and electrical cords. On one <b>occasion,</b> <b>when</b> Donald was only six months old, he picked him up and hurled him through a window. Nicole, afraid that Johnny might kill her, left the family and returned to Canada. Later, {{she came back to}} take the children, but left Donald to live with his father for another four years, until Donald's paternal grandmother sent him to Canada. Donald's mother later stated that she left him behind because her future husband was prejudiced and wanted to avoid having another mixed-race child in the house.|$|E

5|$|In the {{following}} years, MacLaren {{and his family}} struggled financially. His wife's family sometimes sent money, but MacLaren often spent extravagantly whenever he had funds. On one <b>occasion,</b> <b>when</b> paid for writing an article, he moved out of his accommodation into an expensive hotel, and threw a dinner party for his friends. He ran up many debts—including an unpaid champagne bill at Old Trafford Cricket Ground in 1923—and borrowed money from friends. He supplemented his wife's income through working as a journalist and a coach. Among other business ventures, he designed a cricket bat, showed specially shot cricket films, briefly owned a hotel and attempted to start a horse bloodstock agency. He continued to play club cricket and in 1924–25 he managed a privately organised tour of South Africa.|$|E
5|$|On 16February 1944, the {{day after}} the {{contentious}} destruction of Monte Cassino, Eaton took No.3 Squadron through a break in the bad weather to attack the ruined monastery, the only one of No.239 Wing's units to successfully bomb its target that day. He handed over command of No.3 Squadron later that month, and was transferred to No.1 Mobile Operations Room Unit as forward air controller for the final assault on Monte Cassino. The run of luck that Eaton experienced in his first weeks of air combat in Tunisia continued on the ground in Italy. He survived three months of constant artillery fire, including an <b>occasion</b> <b>when</b> a shell exploded directly above his observation post, striking down a British officer standing next to him. He also came under machine-gun fire when he took a wrong turn one day and drove into the German lines, but again escaped unhurt. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order on 7April, in recognition of his leadership of No.3 Squadron in North Africa, Malta, Sicily and Italy.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 4–5 February 1917, the 13th Battalion—with Murray {{commanding}} A Company—attacked the German position at Stormy Trench. Preceded by a heavy artillery barrage, A Company seized {{the right of the}} position after overcoming stiff resistance, consolidating their gains by setting up a makeshift barricade. The Germans counterattacked, prompting Murray to send an SOS signal to the artillery officer, calling for more support. Although repulsed, the Germans counterattacked twice more. On the third attack, Murray organised a twenty-man grenade bombing party and led them in a charge against their attackers, pushing them back to their original start line. On another <b>occasion</b> <b>when</b> the company lost some ground, Murray rallied his men and retook it. Between midnight and 03:00, the company maintained spasmodic bombing, repelling further assaults with the aid of artillery support. By 20:00 on 5 February, the 16th Battalion relieved Murray's company, which had only 48 survivors from the 140 who had begun the attack.|$|E

5|$|Sheila {{continued}} with her secretarial course, then {{trained as a}} hairdresser, and briefly found work as a model with the Lucie Clayton agency, which included two months' work in Tokyo. She got pregnant again, and she and Colin married at Chelmsford Registry Office in May 1977 when Sheila was 20, but she lost the baby at six months. The Bambers bought the couple a garden flat in Carlingford Road, Hampstead, to help Sheila recuperate. She suffered another miscarriage, then on 22 June 1979, after four months of bed rest in hospital, {{she gave birth to}} the twins. At around this time, Colin began an affair, one that led to his leaving Sheila five months after the birth. Sheila became increasingly upset; on one <b>occasion,</b> <b>when</b> Colin left a party with another woman, she required hospital treatment after breaking a window with her fist. The couple divorced in May 1982.|$|E
5|$|Dowding saw 12 Group as the {{protector}} of the Midlands and a reserve for 11 Group. Mallory and Bader wanted to ignore both the defence of the Midlands and keeping a reserve in order to commit 12 Group to battle. In essence, they proposed the opposite of Dowding and resolved to commit the reserves before the front-line units. While this method might have spared 11 Group, it had its problems. Although Mallory and Bader wanted to stop the enemy before it hit RAF airfields, {{the amount of time}} it took to position large formations for interception meant that the Big Wing often failed to achieve this. Instead, they engaged the enemy as he withdrew. Prompted by a supporting comment from Leigh-Mallory, to the effect that it did not matter when an interception was made, as long as it accounted for a large number of enemy aircraft, Bader announced that he would rather destroy 50 German bombers after hitting their targets than 10 before. The argument was strong; crippling losses would act as a deterrent, so that damage sustained on an <b>occasion</b> <b>when</b> the Germans did get through would have to be offset against later occasions when they did not even care to try.|$|E
5|$|In the Fourth Test at Adelaide, both Lindwall and Miller {{broke down}} in the middle of match, leaving Australia two bowlers short. In their absence, Johnston took 5/110 and 2/67 but Australia were unable to force a win. He sent down 587 balls for the entire match. Lindwall and Miller were unable to play in the Fifth Test, and in their absence, the South Africans were able to score heavily. Johnston had a large workload, taking 6/152 and 1/114 as the {{tourists}} won by six wickets to level the series 2–2. On this occasion, Johnston sent down 662 balls for the match. In the last two Tests, Johnston conceded more than 100 runs in three of the four innings with the increased burden in his colleagues' absence; the only previous <b>occasion</b> <b>when</b> he had conceded a century of runs in an innings was in the First Test against England in 1948 when Lindwall broke down mid-match. Johnston was again Australia's leading wicket-taker with 21 wickets, but his average of 35.10 was substantially higher than in previous seasons, as Australia struggled to a 2–2 series result. It was the first time Australia had not won a Test series since the 1938 Ashes tour. Yet, he remained the top ranked ICC Test Bowler for three consecutive years from 1950. His best effort against the South Africans was in the second tour match between Victoria and the tourists, in which he totalled 7/122. Aided by his two ten-wicket match hauls against Queensland, Johnston totalled 59 wickets at 26.47 for the season.|$|E
