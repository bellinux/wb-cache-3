The sum is over the relativistic arc length of the path of an <b>oscillating</b> <b>quantity,</b> and like the nonrelativistic path integral should be interpreted as slightly rotated into imaginary time. The function [...] can be evaluated when the sum is over paths in Euclidean space: ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a generic, scalable approach to obtain closed-form state-trajectory expressions for high-order (order > 2) lowpass sigma-delta (/spl Sigma//spl Delta/) modulators with distinct noise transfer function (NTF) zeros. Constant modulator input is assumed. The techniques of state-space diagonalization, continuous-time embedding, and Poincare map analysis are combined and extended. It is shown that an even-order modulator can be decomposed into individual second-order subsystems with circular trajectories about two half-plane centers, while an odd-order modulator {{will result in}} an additional first-order subsystem represented by an <b>oscillating</b> <b>quantity.</b> The trajectory and half-plane transition expressions thus obtained provide effective tools for stability analysis of /spl Sigma//spl Delta/ modulators. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|We address an issue: {{would the}} cosmological scale factor be a locally <b>oscillating</b> <b>quantity?</b> This problem is {{examined}} {{in the framework of}} two classical 1 + 1 -dimensional models: the first one is a string against a curved background, and the second one is an inhomogeneous Bianchi I model. For the string model, it is shown that there exist the gauge and the initial condition providing an oscillation of scale factor against a slowly evolving background, which is not affected by such an oscillation "at the mean". For the inhomogeneous Bianchi I model with the conformal time gauge, an initially homogeneous scale factor can become inhomogeneous and undergo the nonlinear oscillations. As is shown these nonlinear oscillations can be treated as a nonlinear gauge wave. Comment: 10 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
5000|$|According to some {{conventions}} {{the factor}} of 1/2 {{in the above}} definition may be left out. Multiplication by 1/2 is required to properly describe the power flow since the magnitudes of [...] and [...] refer to the peak fields of the <b>oscillating</b> <b>quantities.</b> If rather the fields are {{described in terms of}} their root mean square (rms) values (which are each smaller by the factor [...] ), then the correct average power flow is obtained without multiplication by 1/2.|$|R
40|$|A general {{investigation}} of linear drift-wave phenomena in cylindrically bounded plasmas, {{immersed in a}} magnetic field without shear and curvature, is performed within the two-fluid hydrodynamical approximation, taking into account electron-temperature oscillations and inhomogeneous radial distributions of the undisturbed electron density and temperature. For plasmas in which the electron temperature strongly exceeds the ion temperature the problem is reduced to an ordinary complex second-order differential equation describing the radial distribution of the oscillating electric potential. It is shown {{that the presence of}} electron-temperature oscillations (which must always exist in order to satisfy electron-energy conservation) and of radial gradients in the undisturbed electron temperature (which must always exist owing to cooling of the plasma at the boundary) leads to an important modification of the theory of drift waves in cylindrical plasmas (with regard to their stability and the radial distribution of the <b>oscillating</b> <b>quantities)</b> compared with previous papers in which these phenomena were disregarded. A numerical program for solving the corresponding complex-eigenvalue problem has been derived that allows a realistic calculation of all the quantities pertaining to drift-wave phenomena. It has been applied, in particular, to the calculation of the radial distribution of the oscillating coherent magnetic fields accompanying the coherent drift waves. The numerical results prove to be in good agreement with experiments performed with a helium plasm...|$|R
40|$|More than {{a decade}} ago, a {{surprising}} coexistence of synchronous and asynchronous behavior called the chimera state was discovered in networks of nonlocally coupled identical phase oscillators. In later years, chimeras were found to occur {{in a variety of}} theoretical and experimental studies of chemical and optical systems, as well as models of neuron dynamics. In this work, we study two coupled populations of pendulum-like elements represented by phase oscillators with a second derivative term multiplied by a mass parameter m and treat the first order derivative terms as dissipation with parameter ϵ> 0. We first present numerical evidence showing that chimeras do exist in this system for small mass values 0 <m<< 1. We then proceed to explain these states by reducing the coherent population to a single damped pendulum equation driven parametrically by <b>oscillating</b> averaged <b>quantities</b> related to the incoherent population...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Quantum {{properties}} of a modified Caldirola-Kanai oscillator model for propagating electromagnetic fields in a plasma medium are investigated using invariant operator method. As a modification, ordinary exponential {{function in the}} Hamiltonian is replaced with a modified exponential function, so-called the q-exponential function. The system {{described in terms of}} q-exponential function exhibits nonextensivity. Characteristics of the quantized fields, such as quantum electromagnetic energy, quadrature fluctuations, and uncertainty relations are analyzed in detail in the Fock state, regarding the q-exponential function. We confirmed, from their illustrations, that these <b>quantities</b> <b>oscillate</b> with time in some cases. It is shown from the expectation value of energy operator that quantum energy of radiation fields dissipates with time, like a classical energy, on account of the existence of non-negligible conductivity in media. 1...|$|R
40|$|Two {{different}} Euler {{codes for}} hovering rotor calculations, developed by DLR and ONERA, are compared and assessed using common computational grids. The test cases {{are based on}} the Caradonna- Tung data base and on the new HELISHAPE tests with 4 -bladed 7 A rotor,scheduled for end of 1995. For all test cases the predicted pressure distributions of both codesare in good agreement. Considering that Euler calculation do not account for viscous effects the predicted surface data also compare well with experiments. A detailed comparison of the wake and tip vortex representation by both Euler methods shows some differences. The strong effects of numerical diffusion on wake resolution are demontrated. It is found that a detailed wake and vortex representation hinders the con- vergence to steady state of the Euler methods, particularly the integrated flow <b>quantities</b> <b>oscillate</b> with iteration...|$|R
40|$|We study time {{dependent}} {{property of}} double quantum dots coupled to two reservoirs using the non-equilibrium Green function method. For arbitrary time dependent bias, we derive {{an expression of}} the time-dependent electron density of a dot and the current between these dots in the wide band limit approximation. For the special case of a constant bias, we calculate the electron density and the current numerically. As a result, we find that these <b>quantities</b> <b>oscillate</b> and the number of crests in a single period of the current changes depending on the bias voltage. We also obtain an analytical expression of the relaxation time, which expresses how fast the system converges to its steady state. From the expression, we find out that the relaxation time becomes constant when the coupling strength between the dots are large enough in comparison with the difference of coupling strength between the dots and the reservoirs.

3000|$|In this article, {{we study}} the {{thermoelectric}} effect {{in a single}} QD ring with both Coulomb interaction and magnetic flux at room temperature. The electrical conductance, thermal conductance, thermopower, and thermoelectric figure-of-merit as functions of the QD energy level are investigated in the linear-response regime, where the temperature and the bias voltage {{differences between the two}} leads all tend to zero. We found that, different from symmetric coupled double QDs AB ring, high ZT values can be obtained even without the help of magnetic field. All the thermoelectric <b>quantities</b> <b>oscillate</b> with magnetic field with a period of 2 π. The ZT magnitude will be suppressed except for the magnetic flux values are at ϕ = n (n + 1) π / 2 (n = 0, 1, 2 [...]. [...]. [...].). Moreover, the figure-of-merit can be enhanced obviously if we choose weak dot-lead and inter-lead coupling strengths as well as strong intradot Coulomb interaction. By optimizing a number of parameters, ZT can be much larger than 3 at room temperature.|$|R
40|$|A predator-prey {{relationship}} between storm track intensity and growth rate {{is revealed in}} reanalysis data for the North Atlantic and North Pacific, {{as well as in}} an idealised global circulation model with a zonally asymmetric heating dipole. Averaging in the phase space of these two quantities reveals that both <b>quantities</b> <b>oscillate</b> on approximately monthly timescales. These oscillations occur due to quasi-periodic bursts in storm track activity that reduce excess baroclinicity and bring the flow back towards a state that is marginally stable to those bursts. Many detailed properties of these oscillations are reproduced well by a two-dimensional dynamical system, especially in respect of the North Atlantic storm track which is more zonally constrained compared to the North Pacific. It is predicted and observed that on average stronger storm events occur less frequently but grow on a shorter timescale. The results suggest that nonlinearly oscillating behaviour around a state of baroclinic neutrality is a general feature of localised storm tracks, and they offer a new perspective on the study of baroclinic instability...|$|R
