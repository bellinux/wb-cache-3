5|$|Although Howe {{was in a}} {{favourable}} position, Villaret had {{not been}} idle during the night. He had attempted, with near success, to distance his ships from the British fleet; when dawn broke at 05:00 he was {{within a few hours}} of gaining enough wind to escape over the horizon. Allowing his men to breakfast, Howe took full advantage of his position on the weather gage to close with Villaret, and by 08:12 the British fleet was just four miles (6km) from the enemy. By this time, Howe's formation was strung <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> organised line parallel to the French, with frigates acting as repeaters for the admiral's commands. The French were likewise in line ahead and the two lines began exchanging long-range gunfire at 09:24, whereupon Howe unleashed his innovative battleplan.|$|E
5|$|In June 2013, Kohli {{featured}} in the ICC Champions Trophy in England which India won. He scored a match-winning 144 against Sri Lanka in a warm-up match. He scored 34, 22 and 22 not out in India's group matches against South Africa, West Indies and Pakistan respectively, while India qualified for the semifinals with an undefeated record. In the semifinal against Sri Lanka at Cardiff, he struck 58 not <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> eight-wicket win for India. The final between India and England at Birmingham was reduced to 20 overs after a rain delay. India batted first and Kohli top-scored with 43 from 34 balls, sharing a sixth-wicket partnership of 47 runs off 33 balls with Ravindra Jadeja and helping India reach 129/7 in 20 overs. India went on to secure a five-run win and their second consecutive ICC ODI tournament victory.|$|E

5|$|India {{embarked}} {{on its first}} tour of Australia {{in the summer of}} 1947–48, and the hosts won the first series between the two countries 4–0. After failing to pass 50 in the first two Tests, Hassett hit 80 in a rain-affected Third Test win, and then his highest Test score, 198 not <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> innings win in the Fourth Test in Adelaide, finishing the series with 332 runs at 110.67. Hassett was rested from the Fifth and final Test as Australia sought to try out new players such as Sam Loxton ahead of the tour of England. He remained in strong form for Victoria, scoring 118 and 204 against South Australia and Queensland respectively, but his state were unable to retain their title, losing three and winning two matches when Hassett was available. He ended the season with 893 runs at 68.69.|$|E
5|$|Macartney's {{exploits}} were {{noticed by}} the State selectors, {{and he made}} his first class debut for New South Wales against Queensland {{at the start of the}} 1905–06 season. He made 56 in New South Wales' first innings of 691, and after not bowling in the first innings, he took 3/80 and his first catch in an innings victory. He then scored 70 not <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> innings triumph over South Australia. He failed to pass 25 in his remaining four matches for the season, but took at least one wicket in each game. In one match for his state against an Australian XI, Macartney took a total of 5/123, including the wickets of Trumper and Australian Test captains Noble and Joe Darling. He was also run out in both innings. Aside from this match, New South Wales were victorious in the remaining five fixtures. He scored 185 runs at 26.43 and took 15 wickets at 28.20 in six matches.|$|E

Swinging the ball both ways, Pathan took 5/45 and 6/51 {{including}} several LBW decisions in the First Test in Dhaka to claim his first ten-wicket haul and his first Test man of the match award as India claimed a commanding innings victory. He followed this with a match haul of 7/118 in the following match in Chittagong to take 18 wickets at 11.88 to be named as man of the series. India swept the series, winning both matches by an innings. Although the Indian batsmen scored heavily, Pathan managed only five and four. He played in {{only one of the}} three ODIs against the hosts as India rotated their players, taking 1/45 and scoring 21 not <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> 11-run win.|$|E
5|$|Rivoli {{departed}} Venice on 21 February 1812 {{under the}} command of Commodore Jean-Baptiste Barré, accompanied by five smaller escort ships, the 16-gun brigs Mercure and Iéna, the 8-gun brig Mamelouck and two small gunboats, strung <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> improvised line of battle. Barré hoped to make use of a heavy sea fog that had descended, to break out from Venice and elude pursuit. Victorious had held off from the land during the fog and by the time Talbot was able to observe Venice harbour at 14:30, his opponent had escaped. Searching for Barré, who was sailing to Pula, Talbot spotted one of the French brigs at 15:00 and gave chase.|$|E
5|$|Struggling to {{rule the}} independent-minded cities of Ionia, the Persians {{appointed}} local tyrants to rule each of them. This {{would prove to be}} the source of much trouble for the Greeks and Persians alike. In 498 BC, supported by troops from Athens and Eretria, the Ionians marched on, captured, and burnt Sardis. However, on their return journey to Ionia, they were followed by Persian troops, and decisively beaten at the Battle of Ephesus. This campaign was the only offensive action taken by the Ionians, who subsequently went on the defensive. The Persians responded in 497 BC with a three-pronged attack aimed at recapturing the outlying areas of the rebellious territory, but the spread of the revolt to Caria meant the largest army, under Darius, moved there instead. While at first campaigning successfully in Caria, this army was wiped <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> ambush at the Battle of Pedasus. This resulted in a stalemate for the rest of 496 and 495 BC.|$|E

Filming was done by a camera on a tripod and frames were called out by Anno because the production lacked timing sheets.|$|E
5|$|Triceratops species {{possessed a}} sturdy build, with strong limbs, short hands with three hooves each, and short feet with four hooves each. Although {{certainly}} quadrupedal, the posture of these dinosaurs {{has long been}} the subject of some debate. Originally, it was believed that the front legs of the animal had to be sprawling at angles from the thorax in order to better bear the weight of the head. This stance can be seen in paintings by Charles Knight and Rudolph Zallinger. Ichnological evidence in the form of trackways from horned dinosaurs and recent reconstructions of skeletons (both physical and digital) seem to show that Triceratops and other ceratopsids maintained an upright stance during normal locomotion, with the elbows flexed and slightly bowed <b>out,</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> intermediate state between fully upright and fully sprawling (as in the modern rhinoceros).|$|E

He then {{established himself as}} a Test opener in the third Test at Headingley, where Australia were sent in to bat on a sticky wicket with erratic bounce. After opening partner Warren Bardsley was dismissed without scoring from the first ball, Woodfull put on a second wicket partnership of 235 with Charlie Macartney to register his maiden Test century of 141. Macartney launched a vicious counterattack and became the second Australian to score a Test century before lunch on the opening day; this bold play helped Woodfull to settle in and the Australians to seize the initiative on a bowler-friendly surface. The tourists made 494 on the sticky wicket and forced England to follow on, but were unable to finish them off.|$|E
