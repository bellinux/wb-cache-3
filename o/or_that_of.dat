5|$|At the 1906 election, Deakin {{remained}} Prime Minister {{even though}} Labour gained considerably more seats than the Protectionists. When Watson resigned in 1907, Fisher succeeded him as Labour leader, although Hughes and William Spence also stood for the position. Fisher {{was considered to}} {{have a better understanding of}} economic matters, was better at handling caucus, had better relations with the party organisation and the unions, and was more in touch with party opinion. He did not share Hughes' passion for free trade <b>or</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Watson and Hughes for defence (and later conscription). In political terms he was a radical, on the left-wing of his party, with a strong sense of Labour's part in British working-class history.|$|E
5|$|Data on Kepler-40 was {{analyzed}} {{by a team}} of French and Swiss astronomers, who first tested for false positives. When all obvious false positives were cleared, the science team used the SOPHIE échelle spectrograph at the Haute-Provence Observatory in southern France to gather radial velocity measurements on the star. Collected data was then checked to see if it corresponded with that of a closely orbiting binary star <b>or</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> a planet; it was found to be that of a planet, leading to the confirmation of Kepler-40b.|$|E

5|$|Grey reef {{sharks are}} fast-swimming, agile predators that feed {{primarily}} on free-swimming bony fishes and cephalopods. Their aggressive demeanor {{enables them to}} dominate many other shark species on the reef, despite their moderate size. Many grey reef sharks have a home range on a specific area of the reef, to which they continually return. However, they are social rather than territorial. During the day, these sharks often form groups of five to 20 individuals near coral reef drop-offs, splitting up in the evening as the sharks begin to hunt. Adult females also form groups in very shallow water, where the higher water temperature may accelerate their growth <b>or</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> their unborn young. Like other members of its family, the grey reef shark is viviparous, meaning the mother nourishes her embryos through a placental connection. Litters of one to six pups are born every other year.|$|E
5|$|In the {{eleventh}} century, Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen, 965–1040) rejected the Greek ideas about vision, whether the Aristotelian tradition that {{held that the}} form of the perceived object entered the eye (but not its matter), <b>or</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Euclid and Ptolemy that held that the eye emitted a ray. Al-Haytham proposed in his Book of Optics that vision occurs by way of light rays forming a cone with its vertex {{at the center of the}} eye. He suggested that light was reflected from different surfaces in different directions, thus causing objects to look different. He argued further that the mathematics of reflection and refraction needed to be consistent with the anatomy of the eye.|$|E

5|$|Social {{aggregation}} is {{well documented}} in grey reef sharks. In the northwestern Hawaiian Islands, large numbers of pregnant adult females have been observed slowly swimming in circles in shallow water, occasionally exposing their dorsal fins or backs. These groups last from 11:00 to 15:00, corresponding to peak daylight hours. Similarly, at Sand Island off Johnston Atoll, females form aggregations in shallow water from March to June. The number of sharks per group differs from year to year. Each day, the sharks begin arriving at the aggregation area at 09:00, reaching a peak in numbers during the hottest {{part of the day}} in the afternoon, and dispersing by 19:00. Individual sharks return to the aggregation site every one to six days. These female sharks are speculated to be taking advantage of the warmer water to speed their growth <b>or</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> their embryos. The shallow waters may also enable them to avoid unwanted attention by males.|$|E
5|$|Structure 5D-43 is {{an unusual}} radial temple in the East Plaza, built over a {{pre-existing}} twin pyramid complex. It {{is built into the}} end of the East Plaza Ballcourt and possessed four entry doorways and three stairways, the fourth (south) side was too close to the Central Acropolis for a stairway on that side. The building has a talud-tablero platform profile, modified from the original style found at Teotihuacan. In fact, {{it has been suggested that}} the style of the building has closer affinities with El Tajin and Xochicalco than with Teotihuacan itself. The vertical tablero panels are set between sloping talud panels and are decorated with paired disc symbols. Large flower symbols are set into the sloping talud panels, related to the Venus and star symbols used at Teotihuacan. The roof of the structure was decorated with friezes although only fragments now remain, showing a monstrous face, perhaps that of a jaguar, with another head emerging from the mouth. The second head possesses a bifurcated tongue but is probably not that of a snake. The temple, and its associated ballcourt, probably date to the reign of Nuun Ujol Chaak <b>or</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> his son Jasaw Chan K'awiil I, in the later part of the 7th century.|$|E

5|$|The {{election}} judge certifies {{his or her}} decision, {{which is}} final, to the Prime Minister. The judge must also report to the Prime Minister whether any corrupt or illegal practice was established to have been committed by or with the knowledge and consent of any candidate or his or her agent. If a judge intends to report {{a person who was}} neither a party to the proceedings nor a candidate claiming he or she should have been declared elected, that person must be given an opportunity to be heard and to give and call evidence to show why a report should not be made against him. However, where a candidate's agents are found to have been guilty of treating, undue influence or an illegal practice, but the candidate proves that the offences were committed contrary to his or her orders and without his or her sanction or connivance, <b>or</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> his or her election agents, that all reasonable means were taken to prevent corrupt and illegal practices at the election, that the offences were of a trivial and limited nature, and in other respects the election was free from corrupt or illegal practice, the election is not void.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} use {{of slavery}} was in agriculture, {{the foundation of}} the Greek economy. Some small landowners might own one slave, or even two. An abundant literature of manuals for landowners (such as the Economy of Xenophon <b>or</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Pseudo-Aristotle) confirms the presence of dozens of slaves on the larger estates; they could be common labourers or foremen. The extent to which slaves were used as a labour force in farming is disputed. It is certain that rural slavery was very common in Athens, and that ancient Greece did not know of the immense slave populations found on the Roman latifundia.|$|E
5|$|The legal tract {{known as}} Laws of the Brets and Scots, {{probably}} compiled in {{the reign of}} David I (1124–53), underlines {{the importance of the}} kin group as entitled to compensation for the killing of individual members. It also lists five grades of man: King, mormaer, toísech, ócthigern and neyfs. The highest rank below the king, the mormaer ("great officer"), was probably composed of about a dozen provincial rulers. Below them the toísech (leader), appear to have managed areas of the royal demesne, <b>or</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> a mormaer or abbot, within which they would have held substantial estates, sometimes described as shires. The lowest free rank mentioned by the Laws of the Brets and Scots, the ócthigern (literally, little or young lord), is a term the text does not translate into French. There were probably relatively large numbers of free peasant farmers, called husbandmen in the south and north of the country, but fewer in the lands between the Forth and Sutherland. This changed from the twelfth century, when landlords began to encourage the formation of such a class through paying better wages and deliberate immigration. Below the husbandmen a class of free farmers with smaller parcels of land developed, with cottars and grazing tenants (gresemen). The non-free bondmen, naviti, neyfs or serfs existed in various forms of service, under terms with their origins in Irish practice, including cumelache, cumherba and scoloc who were tied to a lord's estate and unable to leave it without permission, but who records indicate often absconded for better wages or work in other regions, or in the developing burghs.|$|E
