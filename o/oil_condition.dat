40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{part of this}} research work summarised all the known potential lubricant degradation effects during engine operation and in particular {{with regard to the}} use of the current generation of biofuels. A qualitative risk assessment was conducted which outlined biodiesel as potentially the most critical fuel. A ‘black box’ model was used to outline the challenge of <b>oil</b> <b>condition</b> monitoring based on summative sensor measurement methods. The theoretical considerations were supported by a statistical analysis which investigated how the presence of multiple contaminants in the oil affects the most common sensor data of permittivity, conductivity and viscosity. ‘Design of Experiments’ (DoE) models were developed for the permittivity, conductivity and viscosity data and expressing mathematically the relationship between the contaminants having a significant influence on each of the sensor data. The findings of the multivariate analysis identified that the effects on permittivity and viscosity provided reliable information about <b>oil</b> <b>condition</b> changes. The concept of an <b>oil</b> <b>condition</b> algorithm in this research was aimed at addressing accuracy and efficiency in predicting the outcome. The core aspect of the algorithm was the use of characteristic maps based on bi-linear regression to predict the fuel, soot and oxidation levels in the oil using permittivity and viscosity as the input data. Based on the predictions using three contaminant components a method to assess the overall condition status is derived. The derived condition status provided the input for an oil drain forecast method which monitors the status within the predefined maximum mileage. Another achievement from this research was the vehicle simulation for different driving profiles and the corresponding simulation of oil degradations. The selected profiles were for a ‘Taxi’, ‘Normal’ driving and ‘Long Distance’ driving. The resulting simulation of fuel, soot and oxidation levels in the oil showed a high correlation compared with the use of real oil analysis based on engineering judgement. The quantitative assessment of the simulated contaminant levels compared with the predicted levels obtained from each characteristic map showed excellent prediction performance. The derived overall condition rating and mileage forecast prediction also showed very good results. The results from this research have shown that this new <b>oil</b> <b>condition</b> algorithm concept using bi-linear characteristic maps has enabled the compromise between predictive accuracy and an efficient and transparent algorithm structure. Validation of the results confirms that the algorithm has the potential to minimise and prevent <b>oil</b> <b>condition</b> related engine failures regardless of the actual fuel used...|$|E

40|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>condition</b> and {{contamination}} {{can be a}} {{major issue}} in lubrication systems such as aircraft, automobiles etc. Lubricating or cooling oil contamination occurs when metallic or non-metallic particles are produced due to wear of machine components and these are not captured by the filter system. Furthermore, thermal stressing causes oxidation and thereby degradation of the oil. Liquid contamination can occur from water condensation or fuel from heat exchangers. These can cause degradation of the oil and reduce the lubricating properties and clogg oil paths and accelerate the wear of moving parts. On-line <b>oil</b> <b>condition</b> monitoring systems are important for preventive maintenance especially for aircraft engine bearings, aviation gearboxes etc. Current on-line <b>oil</b> <b>condition</b> monitoring sensors are mainly eddy current, optical based. These sensors have a major drawback that they are prone to surface contamination and non-linearity. The gauges are also not sensitive enough to detect extremely small particulates or are prone to false detection such as trapped bubbles. A new sensor has been developed using thin film heat transfer sensors that can detect any form of contamination in oil such as metal, nonmetals, oxidation, liquids etc. The sensor works on the principle of measuring the thermal product of the material, as the composition of the material in contact with the sensor changes the thermal product changes and can be detected. The sensor can be used for both on-line and in-line condition monitoring and has been demonstrated to be robust. Initially, lab based tests were carried out to optimise the system for sensitivity and signal to noise ratio. The sensor has been demonstrated to detect 0. 25 % of contaminants by mass.

Time has proven that contamination control in hydraulic and lubricating systems are fundamental to reliability and performance. Contamination control is needed to guarantee {{the quality of the}} oil and machine reliability. Among the several condition monitoring techniques, oil and wear analysis are the most effective for contamination control in hydraulic equipment. An emerging maintenance philosophy is <b>oil</b> <b>condition</b> based maintenance, in which the active monitoring of oil parameters determines the machine health and the variable service intervals. This new maintenance philosophy requires sensor technology able to provide real time indicators of the status of the system. Nowadays, <b>oil</b> <b>condition</b> monitoring sensors are not a mature technology and their performance has not been widely assessed under controlled experimental conditions. This research explains the physical fundamentals of commercially available sensors and it discusses and evaluates their effectiveness under controlled experimental conditions.
