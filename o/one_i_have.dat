25|$|This case tho' {{depending}} upon a practice not common {{in this country}} {{is by no means a}} difficult <b>one.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no doubt but that the error complained of might have been corrected by the same court upon motion, at a subsequent term; but I should not for that reason reverse the judgment, since the party having preferred a writ of error coram vobis had a right to proceed in that way, tho' a shorter, and much less expensive mode might have been pursued.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the morning}} {{somebody}} wakens me, I open my eyes and that's when my roommate from the Mexico Olympic Games says, 'Get up, Monie was killed by Arab terrorists'. I knew him as a joker but that sounded too serious, so without thinking much, in my pyjamas, I went to the entrance door of the apartment, opened it and looked around. I have seen guards from the village and they were speaking to somebody that {{was standing in the}} entrance to apartment number <b>one.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> noticed his dark skin and the hat and I listened, still without being afraid or thinking that something is very dangerous for me, and the guards are asking the permission to let the Red Cross enter apartment one and provide some aid to a wounded person and the man, he refuse. They said, 'Why should you be inhumane ?', and the man replied something like either, the Jews or the Israelis 'are not humane either.' At that point I understood that something is going on and I closed the door.|$|E
500|$|Keats {{was never}} a {{professional}} writer. Instead, he supported himself with a small income that he earned as a surgeon for Guy's Hospital. At the age of 23, Keats left the hospital, losing his source of income, in order to devote himself to writing poetry. He lived with Charles Brown, a friend who collected Keats's poetry while supporting him, during spring 1819 and composed poetry. The early products of this effort included La Belle Dame sans Merci and [...] "Ode to Psyche", {{the first of a}} series of odes that he would write that year. It is uncertain as to when the poem was actually completed, but Keats sent the poem to his brother on 3 May 1819 with an attached letter saying, [...] "The following poem, the last I have written, is the first and only one with which I have taken even moderate pains; I have, for the most part, dashed off my lines in a hurry; this <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done leisurely; I think it reads the more richly for it, and it will I hope encourage me to write other things in even a more peaceable and healthy spirit." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{audience}} became angrier still when in {{the following}} episode, [...] "Eye For An Eye", MacLeod made love to Immortal Annie Devlin. Abramowitz explained the creative decision of his staff by saying that [...] "...someone {{once told me that}} death was an aphrodisiac. It's a thing that pushes you to life and the greatest thing in life, that's 'seize life', is sex." [...] Lineberger wrote in his review of [...] "Eye For An Eye", [...] "This one caused an uproar— one I feel is justified. [...] gave a defense (in my opinion a weak <b>one)</b> (...) <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a high tolerance for insensitive guy stuff, but this got to me. When Duncan rolled into Annie's arms, part of me smirked in appreciation of Duncan's magnetic charm. But the rest of me found his actions cruel to the viewers." [...] Abramowitz confirmed that [...] "...the fans hated it. And the women wanted to string me up. I was a 'cad' and a 'card'..." [...] Paul also reported an angry reaction from the audience after the seventh episode, [...] "The Return of Amanda", in which MacLeod sleeps with Amanda.|$|E
500|$|Johnson had {{the matter}} investigated, and after having Cobb's September 24 doubleheader {{statistics}} re-checked, discovered {{only the first}} game of Cobb's statistics had been scored, but not the second game, in which he went 2-for-3. This put Cobb's suggested actual batting average at [...]385, again ahead of Lajoie's. In the end, Johnson ruled that Lajoie's sacrifice bunt should have been recorded as a hit (which would have allowed him to go 9-for-9) but that Cobb's batting average was greater, recording 196 hits in 509 at bats to Lajoie's 227 hits in 591 at bats. Johnson asked Chalmers if his company would award an automobile to each player, to which he agreed. Initially Lajoie refused the car but eventually relented and accepted it. Cobb said, [...] "I am glad that I won an automobile and am especially pleased that Lajoie also gets <b>one.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no one to criticize. I know the games were on the square and I am greatly pleased to know that the affair has ended so nicely." [...] Lajoie said, [...] "I am quite satisfied that I was treated fairly in every way by President Johnson, but I think the scorer at St. Louis made an error in not crediting me with nine hits. However, I am glad that the controversy is over. I have the greatest respect for Cobb as a batter and am glad of his success." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{arrival of}} Chrissie Watts was {{announced}} barely {{a month before}} she was set to first appear on-screen, and {{came at a time}} when EastEnders was undergoing immense media criticism and falling ratings. The rush of casting meant Oberman had little time to process the enormity of the part she had taken on, declaring: [...] "my feet haven't even touched the ground yet. [...] I haven't had time to think about what this role is going to do to my life! I'm very excited to be part of such a fantastic show and <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been a fan of for many years." [...] She admitted, however, to being [...] "slightly intimidated" [...] by the high media profile and press interest surrounding the show at the time. Indeed, joining EastEnders [...] "proved to be something of a baptism of fire for Oberman", as she was playing opposite Leslie Grantham whose recent return to the show had been a highly publicised event. Twenty-four hours after Chrissie's first episode went to air a scandal surrounding Grantham hit the tabloid papers. According to Oberman, the atmosphere on set the next day [...] "was a bit tense" [...] but, she added, [...] "the Watts are pulling together and we're getting on with it and working". However Oberman was also reportedly finding things difficult, having walked into a highly complicated situation: [...] "Tracy-Ann is still really finding her feet on the show... she feels really left out because all the cast are blackballing Grantham and refusing to talk to him. Since most of her scenes are with Grantham, it's really hard for her." [...] Looking back on the incident after she had left EastEnders, Oberman remarked, [...] "I respect Leslie for fronting it out; he emerged from his dressing room and started working. No one mentioned the story. That's life in EastEnders; the machine never stops." ...|$|E

She said she feared that, at the end of serving her sentence, she would be [...] "in my late 50s a broken, penniless and very much alone woman".|$|E

We could see them, and throughout the last part of the execution—or preparing him when he was still conscious, they gave what looked like black power salutes several times to him, one man and two women. And most strikingly at the end of the execution, as those three were heading out, they yelled, 'The State of California just killed an innocent man!' [...] which is the first time I ever heard any outburst in the death chamber there." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the species}} {{described}} in [...] was [...] "Papilio ecclipsis". This {{was based on a}} specimen sent by William Charlton to James Petiver in 1702, who wrote: [...] "It exactly resembles our English Brimstone Butterfly (R. Rhamni), were it not for those black spots and apparent blue moons on the lower wings. This is the only <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> seen." [...] Carl Linnaeus examined the butterfly, and named it Papilio ecclipsis in Centuria Insectorum Rariorum, including it in his [...] from the 12th edition (1767) onwards. It was not until 1793 that the hoax was discovered by Johan Christian Fabricius, who recognised that the dark patches had been painted on, and that the specimen was a common brimstone butterfly (now called Gonepteryx rhamni). Although the curator at the British Museum [...] "indignantly stamped the specimen to pieces" [...] when he found out, William Jones created two replicas to replace the lost specimen.|$|E
2500|$|Modrić's {{skill in}} the game was {{recognized}} early by Dragan Stojković (Piksi), who stated, [...] "I saw a small blond boy who played exactly like I would. Ideas he was showing then on the terrain were fascinating". Piksi considered him, along with Xavi and Andrés Iniesta, as the most intelligent player. Predrag Mijatović said Modrić became [...] "Madrid's best player, with Ronaldo". Johan Cruyff said Modrić's quality and influence on the game depend on the freedom he gets. Paul Scholes, who played several times against Modrić, {{said in an interview}} with the Manchester Evening News in 2011, [...] "Of the three (Samir Nasri and Wesley Sneijder), Modrić, has been the <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been most impressed with, [...] whenever we played Tottenham, he was the one who stood out". In 2014, Zinedine Zidane included Modrić in his best XI currently playing the game. In 2017, Robert Prosinečki considered Modrić along Šuker as the best Croatian player in the history.|$|E
