In a description given by an anonymous high-ranking GRU official, Kosygin is described as [...] "a lonely and somewhat tragic figure" [...] who [...] "understood our faults and shortcomings of <b>our</b> <b>situation</b> in general and those in our Middle East policy in particular, but, being a highly restrained man, he preferred to be cautious." [...] An anonymous old co-worker of Kosygin said [...] "He always had an opinion of his own, and defended it. He was a very alert man, and performed brilliantly during negotiations. He was able to cope quickly with the material that was totally new to him. I have never seen people of that calibre afterwards." ...|$|E

40|$|I {{respond to}} Chalmers’ (2006, 2010) {{objection}} to the Phenomenal Concept Strategy (PCS) by showing that his objection is faced with a dilemma that ultimately undercuts its force. Chalmers argues that no version of PCS can posit psychological features that are both physically explicable and capable of explaining <b>our</b> epistemic <b>situation.</b> In response, I show that what Chalmers calls ‘our epistemic situation’ admits either of a phenomenal or of a topic-neutral characterization, neither of which supports Chalmers’ objection. On the one hand, if <b>our</b> epistemic <b>situation</b> is characterized phenomenally, then Chalmers’ demand that PCS should explain <b>our</b> epistemic <b>situation</b> is misplaced. PCS can explain <b>our</b> epistemic <b>situation</b> only {{if there is a}} reductive explanation of consciousness. But according to PCS, no reductive explanation of consciousness can be given. On the other hand, if <b>our</b> epistemic <b>situation</b> is characterized topic-neutrally, then PCS is not only physically explicable, but it also explains <b>our</b> epistemic <b>situation.</b> Either way, PCS is saf...|$|R

500|$|However, dissension {{broke out}} almost {{immediately}} after Bartlett's departure over the sharing of food. It had not been possible to drag all the supplies from Shipwreck Camp, and the trek had taken longer than expected; consequently there were shortages of biscuit, pemmican (a compound of dried meat, fat and sugar) and dog food. There was little prospect of augmenting supplies by hunting birds and game until the weather improved in May or June. When Hadley and the Inuit, Kuraluk, returned from a seal hunt on the ice, Hadley was widely suspected of concealing the proceeds of the hunt for his own consumption; the same pair were also accused of wasting scarce cooking oil. McKinlay records that the circumstances depressed morale and destroyed comradeship: [...] "The misery and desperation of <b>our</b> <b>situation</b> multiplied every weakness, every quirk of personality, every flaw in character, a thousandfold." ...|$|E
500|$|Within a {{few days}} all the 14surviving fugitives in Tahiti had {{surrendered}} or been captured. Among Pandora's officers was former Bounty midshipman Thomas Hayward. Heywood's hopes that his former shipmate would verify his innocence were quickly dashed. Hayward, [...] "...like all worldlings raised a little in life, received us very coolly, and pretended ignorance of our affairs." [...] Pandora remained at Tahiti for five weeks while Captain Edwards tried without success to obtain information on Bounty's whereabouts. A cell was built on Pandora's quarterdeck, a structure known as [...] "Pandora's Box" [...] where the prisoners, legs in irons and wrists in handcuffs, were to be confined for almost five months. Heywood wrote: [...] "The heat ... was so intense that the sweat frequently ran in streams to the scuppers, and produced maggots {{in a short time}} ... and the two necessary tubs which were constantly kept in place helped to render <b>our</b> <b>situation</b> truly disagreeable." ...|$|E
500|$|Fernando Alonso ran a {{new power}} unit in his McLaren over the weekend, {{one that he}} had already used once during {{practice}} for the previous race in Russia, having taken the grid penalty for it there. Teammate Jenson Button hoped for Alonso to [...] "annihilate" [...] him, adding: [...] "It's unusual to say that, but in <b>our</b> <b>situation</b> it's about getting it on the car." [...] McLaren also introduced new aerodynamic parts to their cars for the Grand Prix. Both Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen of Ferrari needed to exchange their power units. Having already used the allowed four units for the season, both drivers received ten-place grid penalties. Manor Marussia's Will Stevens was placed back twenty grid spots {{for a change of}} his engine, turbocharger and MGU-H unit. Renault used eleven of their twelve remaining token for changes to their power unit. However, both customer teams, Red Bull and Toro Rosso chose not to run with the update, saying its performance advantage was not worth taking the grid penalties. Both Red Bull and McLaren used new front wings, emulating a concept introduced by Mercedes supposed to create more downforce by directing the airflow towards the outside of the front tyres. Similar changes were made by Ferrari to their SF15-T. In preparation for the effects of the high altitude in Mexico, Mercedes added two [...] "ears" [...] {{at the top of the}} airbox in order to improve cooling to the Energy Recovery System of their power unit.|$|E

In 2011, Ranaldo announced that the band was [...] "ending for a while" [...] following the separation of married couple Gordon and Moore. Thurston Moore updated and clarified the position in May 2014: [...] "Sonic Youth is on hiatus.

2500|$|The phrase [...] "anthropic principle" [...] first {{appeared}} in Brandon Carter's contribution to a 1973 Kraków symposium honouring Copernicus's 500th birthday. Carter, a theoretical astrophysicist, articulated the Anthropic Principle {{in reaction to the}} Copernican Principle, which states that humans do not occupy a privileged position in the Universe. As Carter said: [...] "Although <b>our</b> <b>situation</b> is not necessarily central, it is inevitably privileged to some extent." [...] Specifically, Carter disagreed with using the Copernican principle to justify the Perfect Cosmological Principle, which states that all large regions and times in the universe must be statistically identical. The latter principle underlay the steady-state theory, which had recently been falsified by the 1965 discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation. This discovery was unequivocal evidence that the universe has changed radically over time (for example, via the Big Bang).|$|E

[...] The radio contact allowed the International community to pinpoint the location of the vessel. The Israelis were able to provide information about Abba's radio discussions with the ship to the Reagan administration and notified them that it was Abbas' faction behind the hijacking. Fearing that the terrorists threat to kill passengers had been followed through, and not wanting a repeat of the TWA Flight 847 terrorist incident where the administration looked impotent to act, the American special forces staged in Cyprus were ordered to make preparations to storm the vessel.|$|E

2500|$|During Kokoda, Horii {{had been}} ordered to withdraw, or euphemistically, {{according}} to Bullard, to [...] "advance in another direction". At Gorari, the well-ordered withdrawal collapsed under the pressure applied by the 7th Division.

[...] For the defence of Buna, orders were given by the Japanese that, [...] "It {{is essential for the}} execution of future operations that the Buna area be secured." [...] There, Vasey observes: [...] "The Jap is being more stubborn and tiresome than I thought and I fear a war of attrition is taking place on this front. The Jap won’t go till he is killed and in the process he is inflicting many casualties on us." [...] He went on to write, [...] "I had no idea that the Japanese, or anyone, could be as obstinate and stubborn as he has proved to be. I compared <b>our</b> <b>situation</b> now to Crete reversed, but unfortunately the Japanese is not playing by our rules." [...] The resolve and tenacity of the Japanese defenders was, to Western perceptions, unprecedented {{to the point of being}} [...] "fanatical", and had not previously been encountered.

[...] He came to see Lu Xun, who told him, [...] "The enemy knows that His Majesty has withdrawn his forces, so they have no worries and will concentrate their attacks on us. Besides, they have already stationed troops at critical positions and are poised to strike. Hence, we should remain composed and calm our men, after which {{we will have a}} change of plans and prepare to withdraw.
