On a practical level, Raël promoted the practice {{as a way to}} develop more desirable genetics and eventually prolong memories in new bodies. Shortly after Clonaid's launch, Boisselier began publicizing and managing its operations. In 1999, she announced that she had set up cloning laboratories and had hired a team of six scientists.

5|$|Since {{breeding}} Scamper was not {{an option}} for genetic inheritability, James spent several years researching the possibility <b>of</b> <b>cloning.</b> She chose ViaGen, an animal genetics corporation based in Austin, Texas, to perform the cloning procedure for $150,000. James registered the resulting colt born in 2006 with the American DNA Registry under the name Clayton, who is an identical genetic match to Scamper. James chose a surrogate mare to be the dam of the colt and receive the cloned embryo. At age two, James started Clayton as a breeding stallion. She offered his services to the public at a fee of $4,000. Clayton sired healthy progeny, many of whom have inherited Scamper's genetics. Of special note, the AQHA does not register cloned horses; however, breed registration is not required to compete in barrel racing or other PRCA and WPRA sanctioned rodeo events.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Previous {{research}} has shown that refactoring code clones as soon as they are formed or discovered is not always feasible or worthwhile to perform, since some clones never change during evolution and some disappear in a short amount of time, while some undergo repetitive similar edits over their long lifetime. Toward a long-term goal of developing a recommendation system that selectively identifies clones to refactor, as a first step, we conducted an empirical investigation into the characteristics <b>of</b> long-lived <b>clones.</b> Our study <b>of</b> 13558 <b>clone</b> genealogies from 7 large open source projects, over the history of 33. 25 years in total, found surprising results. The size <b>of</b> a <b>clone,</b> the number <b>of</b> <b>clones</b> in the same group, and the method-level distribution <b>of</b> <b>clones</b> are not strongly correlated with the survival time <b>of</b> <b>clones.</b> However, the number of developers who modified clones and the time since the last addition or removal <b>of</b> a <b>clone</b> to its group are highly correlated with the survival time <b>of</b> <b>clones.</b> This result indicates that the evolutionary characteristics <b>of</b> <b>clones</b> may be a better indicator for refactoring needs than static or spatial characteristics such as LOC, the number <b>of</b> <b>clones</b> in the same group, or the dispersion <b>of</b> <b>clones</b> in a system...|$|R

40|$|International audienceOn {{the basis}} of {{isoenzyme}} studies and population genetic interpretation, we have previously designed a molecular identification tool <b>of</b> two major <b>clones</b> <b>of</b> #Trypanosoma cruzi$ based on both kDNA PCR amplification and southern hybridization using clone specific probes. These tools allow the direct identification of two genetic sub-groups <b>of</b> <b>clones,</b> genetically unrelated in biological samples. In the main vector of Chagas' disease in Bolivia (#Triatoma infestans$) we show that these two groups <b>of</b> <b>clones</b> are wide spread over large geographic distances and infect 92 % of triatomes. We also observe high rates of mixed infections, ranging from 7. 7 % to 85. 7 % according to the localities. In a high endemic area, we show a significant difference <b>of</b> <b>clone</b> distribution between vectors and chagasic children. We have some arguments to think that both groups <b>of</b> <b>clones</b> are not selected during the transmission to man but that later, the control of parasitemia {{would be more effective}} over one of the two groups <b>of</b> <b>clone.</b> The second potential vector in Bolivia is #Triatoma sordida$ in some areas.

40|$|Abstract—Clone {{detection}} {{provides a}} scalable and {{efficient way to}} detect similar code fragments.

40|$|Imprinting {{disorders}} {{induced by}} somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) usually {{lead to the}} abnormalities <b>of</b> <b>cloned</b> animals and low cloning efficiency. Histone deacetylase inhibitors {{have been shown to}} improve gene expression, genomic methylation reprogramming and the development <b>of</b> <b>cloned</b> embryos, however, the imprinting statuses in these treated embryos and during their subsequent development remain poorly studied. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of H 19 /Igf 2 methylation and transcription in porcine cloned embryos treated with trichostatin A (TSA), and examined H 19 /Igf 2 imprinting patterns in cloned fetuses and piglets. Our results showed that compared with the maintenance of H 19 /Igf 2 methylation in fertilized embryos, cloned embryos displayed aberrant H 19 /Igf 2 methylation and lower H 19 /Igf 2 transcripts. When TSA enhanced the development <b>of</b> <b>cloned</b> embryos, the disrupted H 19 /Igf 2 imprinting was largely rescued in these treated embryos, more similar to those detected in fertilized counterparts. Further studies displayed that TSA effectively rescued the disrupted imprinting of H 19 /Igf 2 in cloned fetuses and piglets, prevented the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>cloned</b> fetus and piglet abnormalities, and enhanced the full-term development <b>of</b> <b>cloned</b> embryos. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that aberrant imprinting induced by SCNT led to the abnormalities <b>of</b> <b>cloned</b> fetuses and piglets and low cloning efficiency, and TSA rescued the disrupted imprinting in cloned embryos, fetuses and piglets, and prevented the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>cloned</b> fetus and piglet abnormalities, thereby improving the development <b>of</b> <b>cloned</b> embryos.

25|$|Organism cloning (also called {{reproductive}} cloning) {{refers to}} the procedure of creating a new multicellular organism, genetically identical to another.

25|$|The term clone {{is used in}} {{horticulture}} {{to refer}} to descendants of a single plant which were produced by vegetative reproduction or apomixis.
