5|$|In the 20th century Scotland {{made a major}} {{contribution}} to the British participation in {{the two world wars}} and suffered relative economic decline, which only began to be offset with the exploitation of North Sea Oil and Gas from the 1970s and the development <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>technologies</b> and service industries. This was mirrored by a growing sense of cultural and political distinctiveness, which {{towards the end of the}} century, culminated in the establishment of a separate Scottish Parliament within the confines of the United Kingdom.|$|E

40|$|Technology is a {{constantly}} evolving field. The author considers that technology-representing smartphones today cannot be isolated {{in relation to}} the stock prices of technological companies. This research considers how the computer market reacts to <b>new</b> <b>technology.</b> A relationship between the introduction <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> and the stock price of a leading computer company 2 ̆ 2 Apple 2 ̆ 2 is explored. The author uses announcement dates for smartphones, gaming systems and programming systems for the introduction <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>technology.</b> Announcements <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> made by Apple include that for iPhones, iPads and iTunes etc. Announcements <b>of</b> <b>new</b> products made by other rival technological companies such as Motorola, Samsung, BlackBerry, Nokia, Sony, and Microsoft are also considered. This paper, using a pooled OLS methodology and the data for announcements <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> and stock prices for the major seven technological companies all over the past decade (between 2003 and 2013), found out the following results. First, announcements <b>of</b> a <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> or a <b>new</b> product made by Apple has a statistically significant effect on the stock price of Apple. Second, announcements <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> or a <b>new</b> product made by rival companies of Apple also {{have a significant effect on}} Apple 2 ̆ 7 s stock price. The paper concludes that this research can help to predict the impact that announcement dates can have on stock in the future...|$|R
5|$|Set in {{the near}} future during an alien {{invasion}} of Earth, the game puts the player in control of an elite multinational paramilitary organization called XCOM and is tasked with defending the Earth. The player commands troops in the field in a series of turn-based tactical missions; between missions, the player directs the research and development <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>technologies</b> from recovered alien technology and captured prisoners, expands XCOM's base of operations, manages XCOM's finances, and monitors and responds to alien activity.|$|E
5|$|The {{appearance}} of new Soviet tanks {{such as the}} T-80B during the late 1970s and early 1980s demanded the development <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>technologies</b> and weapons {{to counter the threat}} posed to Western armor. The T-80B had increased firepower and a new composite ceramic armor. The T-72 also went through a modernization program in an attempt to bring it up to the standards of the T-80B. In 1985 the new T-72B version entered production, with a new laminate armor protection system; its turret armor, designed primarily to defeat anti-tank missiles, surpassed the T-80B's in protection.|$|E
5|$|TransÉnergie uses series {{compensation}} {{to alter the}} way electricity behaves in power transmission lines, which improves the electricity transmission efficiency. This reduces the need to construct new power lines and increases the amount of electric power sent to population centres. Series compensation is based on capacitor technology. To maintain its transmission system performance, TransÉnergie sets aside funds for research and application <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>technologies.</b> In addition to power transmission technology, Hydro-Québec plans to offer high-speed internet over its transmission lines within a few years; the utility started testing internet over its lines in January 2004.|$|E

5|$|When the Arizona Territory {{was formed}} in 1863 from the {{southern}} portion of the New Mexico Territory, Pima County and later Cochise County—created from the easternmost portion of Pima County in January 1881—were subject to ongoing border-related conflicts. The area was characterized by rapidly growing boom towns, ongoing Apache raids, smuggling and cattle rustling across the United States-Mexico border, growing ranching operations, and the expansion <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>technologies</b> in mining, railroading, and telecommunications.|$|E
5|$|With the {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>technologies,</b> by the 17th century it was realised that while Valletta's fortifications were well designed, {{they were not}} strong enough to withstand a heavy attack. Because of this, the Floriana Lines, encircling Valletta's original land front, were built from 1635 to the 1640s. In the 18th century, a suburb developed between the Floriana Lines and Valletta's land front, and it became known as Floriana, today a town in its own right.|$|E
5|$|Driessen explores ways {{in which}} nonhuman animals might be {{understood}} to be engaging in political deliberation. His claim is empirical rather than normative, as he presents nonhuman animals as already being in political dialogue with humans; rather than arguing that rights should be extended to animals, he calls for a recognition of how interactions with animals have always been political. This is particularly noticeable, he argues, when humans {{are involved in the}} development <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>technologies,</b> analysing the example (following Bruno Latour) of Gaston Lagaffe building a door in dialogue with his boss and the office cat, and of farmers and cows using milking robots. He argues that a recognition of this animal deliberation can lead to more thoughtful forms of both environmentalism and democracy.|$|E

Over the following two years, he became {{a consultant to}} the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), a member of the influential General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission, {{a consultant to the}} newly established Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, {{and a member of the}} Scientific Advisory Group of the United States Air Force.|$|E
5|$|In September 1940, Rabi {{became a}} member of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the U.S. Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory. That month, the British Tizard Mission brought a number <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>technologies</b> to the United States, {{including}} a cavity magnetron, a high-powered device that generates microwaves using the interaction of a stream of electrons with a magnetic field. This device, which promised to revolutionize radar, demolished any thoughts the Americans had entertained about their technological leadership. Alfred Lee Loomis of the National Defense Research Committee decided to establish a new laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to develop this radar technology. The name Radiation Laboratory was chosen as both unremarkable and a tribute to the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory. Loomis recruited Lee DuBridge to run it.|$|E
5|$|In many respects, Ranavalona's {{rule was}} a {{continuation}} of precedent established under Radama I. Both monarchs encouraged the introduction <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>technologies</b> and forms of knowledge from abroad, supported {{the establishment of an}} industrialized economy, and adopted measures to professionalize the army. Both viewed foreigners with ambivalence, establishing close personal relationships and drawing upon their expertise while enforcing restrictions on their activities to avert destabilizing changes to existing cultural and political systems. In addition, both contributed to the further development of a complex political bureaucracy that enabled the Merina court to govern remote provinces across an island larger than the Netherlands, Belgium and France combined.|$|E

5|$|Many {{programming}} {{languages are}} already widely accepted and understood. However, {{the desire to}} create radically different programming languages to support the aspect-oriented programming paradigm is not significant due to business-related concerns; there are risks associated with adopting new technologies. Use of an entirely new language relies on a business's ability to acquire new developers. Additionally, the existing code base of a business {{would need to be}} discarded. Finally, a business would need to acquire a new toolchain (suite of tools) for development, which is often both an expense in both money and time. Primary concerns about roadmaps for the adoption <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>technologies</b> tend to be the need to train new developers and adapt existing processes to the new technology.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{the beam}} intensities at superheavy element {{facilities}} result in about 1012 projectiles hitting the target per second; this cannot be increased without burning {{the target and}} the detector, and producing larger amounts of the increasingly unstable actinides needed for the target is impractical. The team at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna is building a new superheavy element factory (SHE-factory) with improved detectors {{and the ability to}} work on a smaller scale, but even so continuing beyond element 120 and perhaps 121 would be a great challenge. Krzysztof Rykaczewski, a professor at Oak Ridge National Laboratory which collaborates with Dubna on superheavy elements, has nevertheless predicted that in one generation element 124 would be reached. Chemist, writer, and philosopher of science Eric Scerri has noted that the development <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>technologies</b> in the field has been driven by the quest for new elements, so that the inability to proceed beyond elements 120 and 121 with current technologies may not necessarily cause a very long pause in new discoveries.|$|E
5|$|In 2072, {{after the}} Citadel Station's demise, TriOptimum's {{attempts}} {{to cover up}} the incident were exposed to the media and the corporation was brought up on charges from multiple individuals and companies for the ensuing scandal. The virus developed there killed the station's population; the ruthless malevolent A.I supercomputer named SHODAN controlled, and eventually destroyed the Citadel Station in hopes of enslaving and destroying humanity. After a massive number of trials, the company went bankrupt and their operations were shut down. The United Nations Nominate (UNN), a UN successor, was established to combat the malevolence and corruption of power-hungry corporations, including TriOptimum. Artificial intelligence was reduced to most rudimentary tasks in order to prevent the creation of another SHODAN-like malevolent AI, and development <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>technologies</b> was halted. Meanwhile, the hacker, who became the most famous person in the world, vanished from public eye.|$|E

5|$|Upon its {{emergence}} in {{the early}} 17th century, the highland kingdom of Imerina was initially a minor power relative to the larger coastal kingdoms and grew even weaker {{in the early}} 18th century when King Andriamasinavalona divided it among his four sons. Following almost a century of warring and famine, Imerina was reunited in 1793 by King Andrianampoinimerina (1787–1810). From his initial capital Ambohimanga, and later from the Rova of Antananarivo, this Merina king rapidly expanded his rule over neighboring principalities. His ambition to bring the entire island under his control was largely achieved by his son and successor, King Radama I (1810–28), who was recognized by the British government as King of Madagascar. Radama concluded a treaty in 1817 with the British governor of Mauritius to abolish the lucrative slave trade in return for British military and financial assistance. Artisan missionary envoys from the London Missionary Society began arriving in 1818 and included such key figures as James Cameron, David Jones and David Griffiths, who established schools, transcribed the Malagasy language using the Roman alphabet, translated the Bible, and introduced a variety <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>technologies</b> to the island.|$|E
5|$|Comprehensive Political Guidance (CPG), {{a policy}} {{document}} {{that had been}} agreed by Defence Ministers in June 2006 and an addition to the 1999 Strategic Concept document, was formally endorsed during the summit. The CPG intends to provide a framework and political direction for NATO's continuing transformation in the coming 10 to 15 years. More specifically, the document expresses {{the belief that the}} principal threats to the Alliance in the coming decades are terrorism, proliferation, failing states, regional crises, misuse <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>technologies,</b> and disruption of the flow of vital resources. According to this document, the Alliance should adapt to these new threats and sets out the Alliance vis-a-vis capability issues, planning disciplines and intelligence for the next 10 to 15 years, including among others the need for joint expeditionary forces and the capability to deploy and sustain them over long periods of time. The document further underlined that NATO's forces should be able to conduct a variety of missions, from high to low intensity, and emphasized the likelihood that NATO will need to carry out a greater number and range of smaller operations. The CPG also confirmed the principle that 40% of the member states' military forces must be redeployable, and 8% must constantly be on operations abroad. This principle makes it, among other things, possible to effectively compare the contributions made by various states, irrespective of the size of their populations.|$|E
