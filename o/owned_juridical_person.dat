The institution was established by decree on 20 November 1940, but received its charter only on 12 June 1942. It specified that the Council was [...] "a State institution with its <b>own</b> <b>juridical</b> <b>person</b> and patrimony", whose members ex officio included government ministers and the Patriarch of All Romania; others were designated by Conducător decrees. As reported by Revista de Igienă Socială (the Romanian eugenicists' review), [...] "its vast program" [...] included [...] "coordinating public and private benefit institutions {{in the realm of}} welfare, guiding and controlling private charities, and lastly taking the initiative in setting up new social welfare establishments." [...] The Council was especially interested in [...] "protecting the working class", spending a reported 100 million lei on school cafeterias, and some 1 million lei on free or subsidized soup kitchens.|$|R
40|$|The nullity of the <b>juridical</b> <b>person</b> is {{a notion}} without {{correspondence}} {{in the old}} civil law theory. In fact the regulation of the <b>juridical</b> <b>person</b> is a matter that enters relatively recent civil law because in traditional approach civil law dealt with natural persons and associations of natural persons only. The difference between the nullity of the agreement of association and the nullity of the <b>juridical</b> <b>person</b> itself, born by such association, is clearly revealed by the law. The two notions are still linked. One cannot imagine a nullity of the agreement without the nullity of the legal person born by such agreement. Nevertheless the nullity of the <b>juridical</b> <b>person</b> is laid down independently, comprising limited cases of occurrences. The regulation of the nullity of the <b>juridical</b> <b>person</b> finds out its correspondence in the Company Law. The nullity of {{the company has a}} distinct regulation, in Company Law, in line with the regulation of the nullity of the <b>juridical</b> <b>person.</b> In this case the civil law imported the notion from commercial law in order to limit the incidences of the nullity aiming the security of the civil circuit and the interest of the third persons. In a general accepted way, nullity represents a civil sanction which impedes the effects of an act concluded in a way that breach the law. The principles {{of the effects of the}} nullity are well recognized and accepted by scholars but the sanction of nullity, applied at a superior level, of the <b>juridical</b> <b>person,</b> has a totally different effects than the old nullity...|$|R

The aim {{of this article is}} to examine this planning and the background of it and to show C-juridical person's attitude toward this planning from the following points. First of all I simply argue why a drastic reduction of social security and a basic-structural reformation (a changing for the worse) of social welfare such a plan mentioned above is occurred. Next I demonstrate that {{the assignment}} to the <b>juridical</b> <b>person</b> for social welfare is considerably different from running for profit and I show the essence of the <b>juridical</b> <b>person</b> for social welfare and it's public character and what a placement policy is. And I examine the policy about making use of social welfare under commercial contract and the relation between this policy and free markets. Lastly I think about running for profit (privatization) in social welfare and the importance of each <b>juridical</b> <b>person</b> for social welfare against such privatization. From the points as mentioned above I conclude that C-juridical person for social welfare will be able to accept B-public welfare residents for persons with disabilities better than other <b>juridical</b> <b>persons</b> for social welfare in A-city...|$|R

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of crime consequences is studied {{as a total}} social and not social, direct and indirect damage caused by crime. The quantitative and qualitative indicators of these consequences are shown. It is determined that concept of crime does not embrace its consequences and victims. The qualitative indicators of crime consequences imply the consequences’ character and structure; the quantitative indicators imply cumulative consequences of certain kinds of crime, the dynamics of certain kinds of consequences and coefficient of certain crime consequences. It is proved that not only physical and <b>juridical</b> <b>persons,</b> but also the public, authorities and associations (groups) of people having no indication of <b>juridical</b> <b>person</b> must be recognized as crime sufferers. It is argued that crimes can cause property and moral damage (goodwill damage), ecological damage, considerable damage of interests protected by the law, information, managerial damage {{and other kinds of}} damage. Theoretically according to criminal law a crime sufferer is a physical, <b>juridical</b> <b>person,</b> an authority, the public, group of people who suffered from physical, property, moral or other kind of damage caused by a completed or uncompleted crime. The author proves the necessity to fix the concept of crime sufferer in criminal law.
