5|$|In 1769, Day and his {{barrister}} friend, John Bicknell, chose Sabrina {{and another}} girl, Lucretia, from orphanages, and falsely declared {{they would be}} indentured to Day's friend Richard Lovell Edgeworth. Day took the girls to France to begin Rousseau's methods of education in isolation. After a short time, he returned to Lichfield with only Sabrina, having deemed Lucretia inappropriate for his experiment. He used unusual, eccentric, and sometimes cruel, techniques to try to increase her fortitude, such as firing blanks at her skirts, dripping hot wax <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms,</b> and having her wade into a lake fully dressed to test her resilience to cold water.|$|E
5|$|Upon her joining, {{however, the}} members of the group are {{targeted}} and murdered one by one. All of their deaths relate to their fears: Mark falls down an elevator shaft, trying to escape from the darkness when the lights go out, and is torn in half. Paul accidentally consumes a cockroach while eating a bag of chips; he is given cleaning solution by a masked figure, and upon drinking it, burns a hole in his throat. Laura begins to suspect these deaths are not accidental. The hospital loses power, leaving Laura, Alison, Darren, Nicky, Dr. Jessica Ryan, and the receptionist Gloria in the dark. Gloria goes to the basement to turn the lights back on, but once the patients return to their rooms, Alison is tied to her bed by the Boogeyman. He places maggots <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms,</b> which burrow into her skin via her self-inflicted incisions, and she kills herself attempting to cut them out.|$|E

It already had a slit sort of built into it, so that gave her freedom of movement. [...] goal is always {{to make sure that}} the actors are comfortable in their costumes, that they can move freely and do their stunts, and that nothing is too restrictive. And that they also look amazing at the same time." [...] The dress also [...] "needed long sleeves so that [...] could have pads on underneath the dress for when she was fighting. And then of course she's got the crazy fight where she's fighting herself...she needed serious freedom of movement in that dress, so we built panels that had stretch, and put them in several areas <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> and her sides, so that it moved with her as she punched...herself." ...|$|E

500|$|Winslet campaigned heavily for {{the part}} of Rose DeWitt Bukater, a free-spirited socialite aboard the ill-fated RMS Titanic, in James Cameron's epic romance Titanic (1997). Cameron was {{initially}} reluctant to cast her, preferring the stars Claire Danes or Gwyneth Paltrow, but Winslet pleaded with him, [...] "You don't understand! I am Rose! I don't know why you're even seeing anyone else!" [...] Her persistence led Cameron to hire her. Leonardo DiCaprio featured as her love interest, Jack. Titanic had a production budget of US$200 million, and its highly arduous principal photography was held at Rosarito Beach where {{a replica of the}} ship was created. Filming proved to be taxing for Winslet. She once nearly drowned, contracted influenza, suffered from hypothermia on being submerged in freezing water, and had bruises <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> and knees. The work-load allowed her only four hours of sleep per day and she felt drained by the experience. David Ansen, writing for Newsweek, called Titanic a [...] "big, bold, touchingly uncynical" [...] film and praised Winslet for capturing her character's [...] "stifled ardor with [...] pained delicacy". Mike Clark of USA Today considered Winslet to be the film's prime asset. Against expectations, Titanic {{went on to become the}} highest-grossing film of all time to that point, grossing over US$2 billion in box-office receipts worldwide, and established Winslet as a global star. The film won 11 Academy Awardsthe most for any filmincluding Best Picture and gained Winslet a Best Actress nomination.|$|E
