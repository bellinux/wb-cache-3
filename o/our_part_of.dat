But I wrote very personally about one family. I think {{it takes a long time}} before a crisis—like AIDS—enters the culture to a point where responses exist in a character, where personal gestures are both individual and resonant in a larger way.It was adapted as the 1999 film Anywhere But Here, starring Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman.

2500|$|Shapira Bar-Or {{and fellow}} Israeli swimmer Jowan Qupty, {{who is a}} Christian Israeli Arab, {{had known each other}} when they were children, and swum {{together}} for the Jerusalem United swim club in Israel. [...] They attended The Bolles School, in Jacksonville, Florida, together. [...] There they were roommates for two years, swim team teammates, and became best friends. [...] Qupty's father, commenting on the friendship and teamwork between his Christian Arab Israeli son and his son's Jewish Israeli roommate/teammate, said: [...] "Just to see them together after the race jumping and hugging each other; they were so happy. I was looking at them through my tears. Coming from <b>our</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the world, you don't see that." [...] The younger Qupty observed that [...] "people were amazed all the time" [...] that he – a Palestinian – and a Jew could coexist, and Shapira Bar-Or said: [...] "It shows how simple the situation is. If I can live with a Palestinian guy, I'm sure in our country we can live with a couple millions of Palestinians and Israelis together." ...|$|E

[...] "Joe Jelke and {{two other}} boys were along, {{and none of the}} three could manage to take their eyes off her, even to say hello to me. She had one of those {{exquisite}} rose skins frequent in <b>our</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the country, and beautiful until the little veins begin to break at about forty; now, flushed with the cold, it was a riot of lovely delicate pinks like many carnations. She and Joe had reached some sort of reconciliation, or at least he was too far gone in love to remember last night; but I saw that though she laughed a lot she wasn't really paying any attention to him or any of them. She wanted them to go, so that there'd be a message from the kitchen, but I knew that the message wasn't coming—that she was safe. There was talk of the Pump and Slipper dance at New Haven and of the Princeton Prom, and then, in various moods, we four left and separated quickly outside. I walked home with a certain depression of spirit and lay for an hour in a hot bath thinking that vacation was all over for me now that she was gone; feeling, even more deeply than I had yesterday, that she was out of my life." ...|$|E

In my work I will deal with optimization problems of a graph. Problem of the maximum network flow that we solve using directed graph can be an example. As for non-directed graphs, we will be interested in the search of a minimum frame of a graph...|$|R
