2500|$|This {{first version}} of the method was {{originally}} called the <b>oral</b> <b>method,</b> the aural-oral method or the structural approach. The audio-lingual method truly {{began to take shape}} {{near the end of the}} 1950s, this time due government pressure resulting from the space race. [...] Courses and techniques were redesigned to add insights from behaviorist psychology to the structural linguistics and constructive analysis already being used. Under this method, students listen to or view recordings of language models acting in situations. Students practice with a variety of drills, and the instructor emphasizes the use of the target language at all times. The idea is that by reinforcing 'correct' behaviors, students will make them into habits.|$|E

[...] Asked to justify that interpretation, Chatoff pointed to the legislative record arguing it was {{the intent of the}} legislation rather than the text of the statute specifically. The justices also questioned him about the implications of upholding such an interpretation, specifically [...] "will your interpretation of the statute require every school board to provide a sign language interpreter for every deaf child in the country?" [...] Chatoff argued that the case was specific to Amy and distinguished between what Amy needed and what other students similarly situated may or may not need: [...] "The deaf community is not a monolithic entity....Not every deaf child can be educated in the public school....Children who are educated in special schools or in research rooms have no need for interpreters. Children raised using the <b>oral</b> <b>method</b> have no need for interpreters. It will be only very specific instances." ...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} a {{comparison}} of the effects of oral speech with total communication (speech plus sign language) training on the ability of mentally retarded children to repeat 4 -word sentences. Three children were chosen who used single words to communicate but who did not combine words into complete sentences. Three sentence pairs were trained, with each pair having one sentence trained using <b>oral</b> <b>methods</b> and an equivalent one trained using the total communication approach. Both training procedures involved chaining sentence parts, reinforcement, and prompting. <b>Oral</b> <b>methods</b> involved presenting vocal stimuli and requiring vocal responses whereas total communication methods involved presenting vocal and signed stimuli and requiring vocal and signed responses. For the initial sentence pair with each child, an alternating treatments design was used to determine the relative efficacy of the two language training approaches. This was repeated with a second and third sentence pair using a multiprobe technique within a multiple baseline design. Results pointed to the superiority of the total communication approach in facilitating sentence repetition. Possible explanations of these results are offered and the utility of the alternating treatments experimental design is discussed...|$|R

The oral movement took off in full swing at the Milan Conference of 1880 where Alexander Graham Bell declared <b>oral</b> <b>methods</b> superior to manual methods.

50|$|This {{policy is}} {{significant}} {{to the local}} deaf community because it has marked a change in educating the deaf.

5000|$|After the Congress, deaf {{education}} in America changed. Manualists, those who advocated for sign language usage, were effectively [...] "kicked out" [...] {{and replaced with}} teachers who used the pure <b>oral</b> <b>method.</b> Deaf teachers {{were removed from the}} profession and replaced with hearing ones. Most schools switched to the <b>oral</b> <b>method</b> or were created as oral schools in the first place, and few manual schools remained in existence. The work of deaf educators in the oralist schools, who were mostly women, was to prepare the deaf children for life in the hearing world, which required them to learn English, speech, and lipreading. All students that were sent to the oral schools were forced to use the <b>oral</b> <b>method,</b> and oralist schools restricted the deaf students' use of American Sign Language (ASL) in class and in public. Students in pure oral programs were not allowed to sign in class and were also forbidden to sign in dormitories. Students caught signing were punished, but students continued to learn sign from each other anyway. One type of punishment used on deaf students was to force them to wear white gloves that were tied together to prevent them from using signs. Those who were not successful under the <b>oral</b> <b>method</b> after several years were transferred to manual classes and considered [...] "oral failures" [...] who would never know anything or {{be able to make it}} in the world.
