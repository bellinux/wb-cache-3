5|$|Mozart had a pet common {{starling}} {{which could}} sing {{part of his}} Piano Concerto in G Major (KV. 453). He had bought it from a shop after hearing it sing a phrase from a work he wrote six weeks previously, which {{had not yet been}} performed in public. He became very attached to the bird and arranged an elaborate funeral for it when it died three years later. It has been suggested that his A Musical Joke (K. 522) might be written in the comical, inconsequential style of a starling's vocalisation. <b>Other</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> owned common starlings report how adept they are at picking up phrases and expressions. The words have no meaning for the starling, so they often mix them up or use them on what to humans are inappropriate occasions in their songs. Their ability at mimicry is so great that strangers have looked in vain for the human they think they have just heard speak.|$|E

2500|$|Riessman's seminal article {{explored}} how nonprofessionals supported {{one another}} in self-help/mutual-aid support groups based on Riessman's observations of a sample of these groups, {{as well as his}} summary of the findings of research in the areas of social work, education, and leadership. This article suggested that although the [...] "use of people with a problem to help <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> the same problem in [...] more severe form" [...] is [...] "an age-old therapeutic approach," [...] the traditional focus on outcomes for those receiving help to the exclusion of considering outcomes for those providing help is too narrow; instead, Riessman advocated for increased consideration of the experience of [...] "the individual that needs the help less, that is, the person who is providing the assistance" [...] because [...] "frequently it is he who improves!" [...] (p.27). Although Riessman expressed doubt that individuals receiving help always benefit from the assistance provided to them, he felt more sure that individuals providing help are likely experiencing important gains; thus, according to Riessman, the helping interaction at least {{has the potential to be}} mutually beneficial for both parties involved (i.e., for both the individual giving and for the individual receiving aid), but it is not absolutely necessary for the [...] "helpee" [...] to benefit in order for the [...] "helper" [...] to enjoy the benefits of helping. In instances where true mutual benefit occurs, the helper and helpee benefit in different ways, such that the person receiving help benefits by way of receiving whatever specific form of assistance is offered to them (e.g., emotional support, information, etc.) while the person providing help benefits by the very act of providing help, regardless of the type of aid they provide.|$|E
