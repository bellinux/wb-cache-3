5|$|Governments {{sometimes}} operate {{units that}} specialize in measurement of the Earth's magnetic field. These are geomagnetic <b>observatories,</b> typically {{part of a national}} Geological survey, for example the British Geological Survey's Eskdalemuir Observatory. Such <b>observatories</b> can measure and forecast magnetic conditions such as magnetic storms that sometimes affect communications, electric power, and other human activities.|$|E
