50|$|What was {{the goal}} {{to develop a}} {{reliable}} self-oscillating mixer? The reasons were to differ from the UK to America. The UK radio manufacturers had to pay a royalty of £1 per valve holder to the British Valve Association to cover use of their members' patent rights. Further, they dictated that not more than one electrode structure could be contained in a single envelope (which would have evaded the royalty - at least in part). The Americans appeared {{to be driven by}} the desire to produce a low-cost 'every expense spared' design which was to lead to the All American Five. By making the mixer self-oscillate, the necessity of providing a separate <b>oscillator</b> <b>valve</b> is avoided. The All American Five was to use a pentagrid converter from when it first appeared in 1934, right up until valves became obsolete when transistors took over.|$|E
50|$|The {{oscillator}} circuit {{is responsible}} for creating the elevated frequency electric current, which when applied to the work coil creates the magnetic field which heats the part. The basic elements of the circuit are an inductance (tank coil) and a capacitance (tank capacitor) and an <b>oscillator</b> <b>valve.</b> Basic electrical principles dictate that if a voltage is applied to a circuit containing a capacitor and inductor the circuit will oscillate {{in much the same}} way as a swing which has been pushed. Using our swing as an analogy if we do not push again at the right time the swing will gradually stop this is the same with the oscillator. The purpose of the valve is to act as a switch which will allow energy to pass into the oscillator at the correct time to maintain the oscillations. In order to time the switching, a small amount of energy is fed back to the grid of the triode effectively blocking or firing the device or allow it to conduct at the correct time. This so-called grid bias can be derived, either capacitively, conductively or inductively depending on whether the oscillator is a Colpitts, Hartley oscillator, Armstrong tickler or a Meissner.|$|E

50|$|A valve {{can contain}} {{more than one}} control grid. The hexode {{contains}} two such grids, one for a received signal {{and one for the}} signal from a local <b>oscillator.</b> The <b>valve's</b> inherent non-linearity causes not only both original signals to appear in the anode circuit, but also the sum and difference of those signals. This can be exploited as a frequency-changer in superheterodyne receivers.|$|R
40|$|In {{connection}} {{with the development of}} apparatus tor the new Communioation Laboratory, the author undertook to investigate the possibility of using a Thermionic <b>Valve</b> <b>Oscillator</b> as a source of high frequency current for experimental work. The object of the investigation was to be a determination of the Frequency Stability and Wave Form of the Output, obtainable. It developed, however, that no method of oscillator design of proven accuracy for low power oscil 1 ators was available and hence the problem or Frequency Stability and Output Wave Form was deferred until the problem of circuit design could be looked into. This involved a thorough study of the factors entering into the design of a <b>Valve</b> <b>Oscillator</b> and also of the methods used by other investigators. [ [...] . ...|$|R

The new software for determination of the inknown parameters in the linear electric circuits according to the diagnostic experiment results in the conditions of real limitations for type and number of the measured values and also the methods and device for adjustment of the <b>valve</b> <b>oscillator</b> for dielectrical heating have been proposed.

50|$|The {{use of this}} {{technology}} survived until the early 1990s {{at which point the}} technology was all but replaced by power MOSFET and IGBT solid state equipment.

50|$|A {{suitable}} transmitter {{need only}} generate {{a number of}} audio tones. Most had a single oscillator, that generated different tones as control buttons were pressed one-by-one. As the control actuators on the model were usually escapements at this time, this limitation was relatively minor. To keep the channels fully independent and simultaneously triggerable, required a separate oscillator for each channel, not merely a single tunable <b>oscillator.</b> In the <b>valve</b> era before transistors, {{that would have been}} unusually expensive. Many period transmitters merely used a number of push-button switches on their case, although some combined these into joystick or wheel controls.|$|R
50|$|Alexanderson {{would receive}} a patent in 1911 for his device. The Alexanderson {{alternator}} followed Fessenden's rotary spark-gap transmitter as the second radio transmitter to be modulated to carry the human voice. Until the invention of vacuum-tube (<b>valve)</b> <b>oscillators</b> in 1913 such as the Armstrong oscillator, the Alexanderson alternator was an important high-power radio transmitter, and allowed amplitude modulation radio transmission of the human voice. The last remaining operable Alexanderson alternator is at the VLF transmitter Grimeton in Sweden and was in regular service until 1996.

40|$|Spin torque {{oscillators}} (STO) {{were developed}} in 2003 and since then great {{progress has been made}} in understanding their underlying physics, frequency of operation, frequency tuning range, and functionality. These nanoscale oscillators with their octave spanning frequency tuning range have been touted for many applications including neuromorphic computing, magnetic field sensing, and microwave signal detection. Since their inception, output power of spin torque oscillators has been improved by five orders of magnitude. In spite of all these developments, the adoption of spin torque oscillators as extremely tunable signal source has been hindered due to their large linewidth and frequency stability issues. Solutions such as using spin torque oscillators in a PLL and injection locking of spin torque oscillators has been demonstrated. However, these solutions need an external signal reference for their implementation. Recently, self-locking of spin torque oscillators to their amplified, delayed output signal has been proposed and initial experiments have demonstrated an encouraging progress in the improvement of the linewidth. Further improving on this concept of self-locking, we propose a system that uses spin torque oscillators in a delay line oscillator with a high quality factor micro-electro-mechanical (MEMS) resonator as the delay element. This spin torque oscillator coupled with a MEMS resonator in a feedback system is presented in this thesis as a magneto-acoustic oscillator. This dissertation presents all the components needed for realizing the magneto-acoustic oscillator as well as addresses the issues and challenges in its implementation. To maintain the tuning capability of magneto-acoustic oscillator we use high-overtone bulk acoustic resonators (HBARs) as the MEMS resonator, as they have numerous resonances spread over large range of frequency. We fabricated and characterized one port, high-overtone bulk acoustic resonators to be used as stress transducers for strain feedback-based magneto-acoustic oscillator. We also developed an analytical model to calculate the stress/strain generated by the HBARs for a given drive voltage. We further performed low temperature characterization of the HBAR resonators, fabricated on different substrate materials, in order to better understand the dominant loss mechanism that limits its performance as a strain generator. Two port, laterally coupled high-overtone bulk acoustic resonators were fabricated and characterized with measurements indicating quality factors upwards of 20, 000 in the 2 to 8 GHz regime. Two port HBARs were demonstrated as high quality factor, narrow bandwidth filters to be used for current feedback-based magneto-acoustic oscillators that are operational over a large frequency range with nominal transmission loss of - 25 dB. We study using strain as the feedback path for implementing a magneto-acoustic oscillator in a macrospin model of a spin torque oscillator. This model incorporates the effect of a uniaxial external AC strain on the spin torque oscillator by considering, the effective field generated by due to the magnetoelastic property of the free layer magnet. We also calculate the threshold amplitude of strain needed to lock the spin torque oscillator and further calculate the gain required for the HBAR to feedback that strain when implemented as a magneto-acoustic oscillator. Comparing the gain needed for locking in current feedback-based magneto-acoustic oscillator and strain feedback-based spin torque oscillator we find that current feedback based magneto-acoustic oscillator performance is superior. CoFeGe/CoFe and Terfenol-D as the free layer based spin valves fabricated at HGST with 6 % MR and SHE-MTJs with 30 % TMR were characterized as spin torque oscillators for implementing the current feedback-based magneto-acoustic oscillators. We demonstrated an open loop current feedback-based magneto-acoustic oscillator, which reduced the linewidth of the spin <b>valve</b> <b>oscillators</b> from 35. 4 MHz to 175 kHz with ∆f_o/f_o ratio as high as 23, 657 was measured for in-plane oscillation mode at 4. 14 GHz. This is the highest measured ∆f_o/f_o ratio for any spin <b>valve</b> <b>oscillator</b> in an open loop configuration. ∆f_o/f_o ratio for the SHE-MTJ oscillator was enhanced by 1070 fold resulted in reducing the linewidth of the oscillator from 300 MHz to 280 kHz. This is the smallest reported linewidth for SHE-MTJs. Upon implementing a closed loop current feedback-based magneto-acoustic oscillator, we observed HBAR oscillations. This was due to the poor isolation from wide bandwidth circulators and because of the high gain needed for locking owing to the low output power of the spin torque oscillators. We propose using a microwave feedback in magneto-acoustic oscillator that eliminates the implementation problems of closed loop current feedback-based magneto-acoustic oscillator by changing the domain of feedback signal from electrical to microwave. We simulated different closed loop magneto-acoustic oscillators using strain, current, and microwave feedback in HSPICE to compare their power efficiencies. Simulation results show that the microwave feedback-based magneto-acoustic oscillator is most promising alternative due to the low gain required in its implementation. 2019 - 02 - 0...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, I {{propose a}} new {{paradigm}} in computing where bits can simultaneously transport and manipulate materials and information. Information representation is invariably physical. Though this insight is fundamental to understanding the physical limits of computation, {{it has never been}} exploited as a scheme for material manipulation. Bringing together notions from computer science and fluid dynamics, I present a new logic family "Bubble Logic" capable of both universal computation and programmable material manipulation in an all-fluidic two-phase system. This removes the distinction between materials and mechanisms to control them, bringing the programmability of the digital world into the physical world - {{with a wide range of}} promising applications in biotechnology, highthroughput screening, genomics and fluidic control systems for soft robotics, printing and digital fabrication. Microfluidics, the art of handling nano-to pico-liter volume fluids, is leading to a revolution in large-scale automation of biology and analytical chemistry. However, current lab-on-chip technologies are dependent on external macro-scale control elements, thus requiring a lab to run the chip. Bubble logic provides a dropletel,internal, inherently digital flow control mechanism at kHz frequencies with no moving parts or off-chip components. Nonlinearity is introduced in an otherwise linear, reversible, low Reynolds number flow via bubble-tobubble hydrodynamic interactions. I demonstrate bubble logic AND/OR/NOT gates, a toggle flip-flop, a ripple counter, a timing restoration device, a ring <b>oscillator,</b> a bistable <b>valve</b> and an on-demand bubble generator. These show the nonlinearity, gain, bistability, synchronization, cascadability, feedback and programmability required for scalable universal computation and control. (cont.) The representation used in this thesis makes possible encapsulation and manipulation of a large variety of micro-to nanocale materials including single molecules like DNA or proteins, live cells, liquid crystals, nano-particles and other biological and chemical reagents. Bubble logic provides a scheme to transport, store and operate on this new class of "digital materials" in an integrated, high-throughput fashion. Furthermore, microfluidics has also been extensively employed in biological systems. This thesis describes the discovery of two new physical fluid dynamic mechanisms motivated by a common theme of microfluidics in biology. Firstly, I describe a new superhydrophobic waterrepelling surface that has a characteristic of directional anisotropy to fluid resistance. The discovery, made while studying the integument of water-walking insects, helps rationalize the origin of thrust and hence propulsion of water-walking insects on a fluid interface. Secondly, this thesis uncovers a new physical mechanism for directed droplet transport, which I term "Capillary ratchet". Discovered in a class of surface feeding shorebirds, it is the only physical mechanism that is known to exploit contact angle hysteresis for fluid transport. Capillary ratchet is a promising candidate for implementing global clocking for integrated microfluidic devices. by Manu Prakash. Thesis (Ph. D.)
