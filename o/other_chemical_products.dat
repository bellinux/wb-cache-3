30|$|However, {{with regards}} to the use of <b>chemical</b> <b>products</b> for water {{treatment}} and their relative costs, {{it should be noted that}} not all <b>chemical</b> <b>products</b> are used to tackle turbidity. The main product used to flocculate suspended material and reduce turbidity is aluminum sulphate, which has the highest share of the cost of chemicals for the treatment process. The use of the <b>other</b> single <b>chemical</b> <b>products</b> is also correlated to the performance of the treatment process, where, for example the better the quality of the final product (i.e. treated/filtered water), the lower the cost with the rest of the <b>chemical</b> <b>products,</b> namely hexafluorosilicic acid, chlorine and calcium oxide.|$|R
25|$|New discoveries about acids, used {{extensively}} in fabric dyeing and metallurgy, {{led to the}} creation of new industries in Paris; the first French plant to manufacture sulfuric acid was opened in 1779. It was owned by the brother of king Louis XVI, the Count of Artois; the King himself promoted it, eager that France complete successfully with England in industrial manufacturing. The chemical factory at Javel branched out to make <b>other</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>products,</b> including chlorine and hydrogen gas; the hydrogen made possible the first manned balloon flights by the Montgolfier Brothers shortly before the Revolution.|$|E
25|$|Coal is an {{important}} feedstock in production {{of a wide range}} of chemical fertilizers and <b>other</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>products.</b> The main route to these products is coal gasification to produce syngas. Primary chemicals that are produced directly from the syngas include methanol, hydrogen and carbon monoxide, which are the chemical building blocks from which a whole spectrum of derivative chemicals are manufactured, including olefins, acetic acid, formaldehyde, ammonia, urea and others. The versatility of syngas as a precursor to primary chemicals and high-value derivative products provides the option of using relatively inexpensive coal to produce a wide range of valuable commodities.|$|E
25|$|The {{energy content}} of waste {{products}} can be harnessed directly by {{using them as}} a direct combustion fuel, or indirectly by processing them into another type of fuel. Thermal treatment ranges from using waste as a fuel source for cooking or heating {{and the use of}} the gas fuel (see above), to fuel for boilers to generate steam and electricity in a turbine. Pyrolysis and gasification are two related forms of thermal treatment where waste materials are heated to high temperatures with limited oxygen availability. The process usually occurs in a sealed vessel under high pressure. Pyrolysis of solid waste converts the material into solid, liquid and gas products. The liquid and gas can be burnt to produce energy or refined into <b>other</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>products</b> (chemical refinery). The solid residue (char) can be further refined into products such as activated carbon. Gasification and advanced Plasma arc gasification are used to convert organic materials directly into a synthetic gas (syngas) composed of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The gas is then burnt to produce electricity and steam.|$|E

25|$|The Hercules site gained {{independence}} from Dupont {{as a result}} of federal anti-trust action in 1912. Hercules Powder Company contributed significantly to the production of explosives during both World Wars. By the Second World War, the plant had diversified to produce fertilizers and <b>other</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>products.</b> Eventually the facility was out-competed by foreign manufacturers, and the plant was closed in 1976. However, by this time the surrounding area was experiencing rapid growth as the commuter belt moved further outward from San Francisco. By the mid-1970s, home construction companies began to build new subdivisions and changed Hercules into the residential suburb as it was known up until the late 1990s. Back in the 1970s, Hercules {{was one of the first}} cities in the United States to develop a comprehensive Noise Element of the General Plan. This work included the production of noise contour maps for all major highways and arterial roads, as well as a citywide mitigation plan. Considerable study has been made of the heavy metal lead accumulated as upper layer soil contamination from prior air pollution smokestack emissions from the California Powder Works operations from this era.|$|E
