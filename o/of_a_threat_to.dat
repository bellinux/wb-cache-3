Magpies will become accustomed to being fed by humans, and although they are wild, {{will return to the}} same place looking for handouts. The idea is that humans thereby appear less <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the nesting birds. Although this has not been studied systematically, there are reports of its success.|$|E
5|$|Early {{forecasts}} remarked {{the potential}} to be more <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> Hawaii than Pauline because Rick was further south than Pauline and thus less likely to weaken since Rick was over of warmer sea surface temperatures than Pauline. It did indeed approached the islands, coming close enough to require a high surf advisory. Even though Rick's intensity was much greater than Pauline's, Hurricane Pauline re-curved sooner than Rick. While the surf did rise somewhat, the waves were significantly lower than the heights experienced during Pauline. The U.S. Coast Guard received a report of an overdue sailing vessel en route to the Hawaiian Island group. However, it is unknown if Pauline or Rick affected the boat's course.|$|E
5|$|Reports from Burundi and Angola warn <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> food {{security}} {{caused by the}} African Cassava Mosaic Virus (ACMD).

CMD is prevalent in all the main cassava-growing areas in the Great Lakes region of east Africa, causing between 20 and 90 percent crop losses in the Congo.

5|$|In {{response}} to the storm's projected path into the Gulf of Mexico, prices for crude oil rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange at branch offices in London. Natural gas prices rose considerably in New York Mercantile Exchange electronic trading on August 2. Anticipation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> supply by a potential Hurricane Chris coupled with high demand during an ongoing heat wave were cited as factors in the price move. In New Orleans, officials including Mayor Ray Nagin prepared for a possible evacuation of the city if Chris entered the Gulf of Mexico as a hurricane. The evacuation plan included moving all residents {{out of the city}} as a worst-case scenario, intended to avoid a re-occurrence of Hurricane Katrina around one year prior. Florida Emergency Management requested ten mobile recovery centers, and placed hospitals in the Florida Keys on standby for evacuation. Officials in Mississippi identified the need for 110 to assist in an evacuation process in case of a possible landfall. Both Louisiana and Texas emergency operation centers monitored the progress of the storm, though did not execute any preparation action.|$|E

25|$|In March 1905, the German kaiser, Wilhelm II, visited Tangier, {{a city of}} {{international}} character in northern Morocco.

At Wilhelm's urging, Sultan Abd el Aziz called for an international conference.

25|$|Emperor John IV of Trebizond {{was aware}} of the threat Mehmed II posed for him at least as early as February 1451, when the Byzantine diplomat George Sphrantzes arrived in Trebizond seeking a bride for his emperor, Constantine XI. John had happily related to the visiting diplomat the news of the death of Sultan Murad II, and that Mehmed II's youth meant that now his empire could last longer and be blessed. Sphrantzes, however, was taken aback and {{explained}} to him that Mehmed's youth and seeming friendship were only ploys, and that Mehmed was more <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> both monarchies than his father had been.|$|E

25|$|In {{studies of}} {{prepared}} learning, conditioned fear responses to images of outgroup males {{were far more}} difficult to extinguish than conditioned fear responses to outgroup females or ingroup members of either sex, as measured by conductivity tests of perspiration on the skin. These results held true whether the participant was male or female. Because the neural circuitry for fear responses are more developed towards stimuli that have posed a larger threat for most of human history (snakes and spiders, for example, which were dangers frequently encountered by foragers), {{these findings suggest that}} outgroup males may have been more <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> physical safety than outgroup women or ingroup members, supporting the male warrior hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Congress {{passed the}} Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, {{which led to}} a lawsuit in the case of Gonzales v. Carhart. The Court had {{previously}} ruled in Stenberg v. Carhart that a state's ban on partial birth abortion was unconstitutional because such a ban did not have an exception in the case <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the health of the mother. The membership of the Court changed after Stenberg, with John Roberts and Samuel Alito replacing William Rehnquist (a dissenter in Roe) and Sandra Day O'Connor (a supporter of Roe) respectively. Further, the ban at issue in Gonzales v. Carhart was a federal statute, rather than a state statute as in the Stenberg case.|$|E
25|$|By {{the terms}} of the Geneva Accord (1954), which ended the Indochina War, France and the Việt Minh agreed to a truce and to a {{separation}} of forces. The Việt Minh had become the government of Democratic Republic of Vietnam since the Vietnamese 1946 general election, and military forces of the communists regrouped there. Military forces of the non-communists regrouped in South Vietnam, which became a separate state. Elections on reunification were scheduled for July 1956. A divided Vietnam angered Vietnamese nationalists, but it made the country less <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> China. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the past and Vietnam in the present did not and do not recognize the division of Vietnam into two countries. Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai negotiated {{the terms of}} the ceasefire with France and then imposed them on the Việt Minh.|$|E

Sunny asks Francis Kunjappan, a Public Works Department minister in Kerala and his friend, for advice on hiring a political consultant. Kunjappan, recommends his friend (and political rival) Jagannathan, hoping to rid himself <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> his ministerial position. Jagannathan, a young politician and sports enthusiast, knows no English but has a talent for solving serious problems prudently (as Kunjappan knows firsthand). However, Kunjappan thinks that Jaganathan’s unorthodox ideas will fail in the United States. Kunjappan meets Jagannathan and offers him the job for 30 crore (300 million), enough to realize Jagannathan's dream project of a sports academy. Jagannathan accepts the assignment and flies to the US with his assistants, Pottakuzhi Jabbar and Vayalar Varkey.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the murder}} of 18-year-old Juanita Mott in April 1975, Fred concreted over {{the floor of the}} entire cellar. He would later convert this section of the {{household}} into a bedroom for his oldest children, and he and his wife are not known to have committed any further murders until May 1978, when Fred—either with or without Rose's participation but certainly with her knowledge—murdered an 18-year-old lodger named Shirley Robinson. Robinson had taken lodgings with the Wests in April 1977, and was heavily pregnant with a baby son {{at the time of her}} murder. Although Rose—herself pregnant at the time—is known to have initially boasted to neighbours the child Robinson was carrying was her husband's, she soon developed a deep resentment of Robinson, and the motive for her murder is likely to have been the removal <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the stability of the Wests' relationship. Her body was buried in the garden of 25 Cromwell Street, and although extensively dismembered, no restraining devices were found with Robinson's remains, thus making a sexual motive for this murder unlikely. Shortly thereafter, Rose unsuccessfully submitted a claim for maternity benefit in Shirley's name with Gloucester social services. As had earlier been the case with Charmaine and Lynda, Fred and Rose allayed the suspicions of anyone who enquired as to Robinson's whereabouts by claiming she had relocated to live with her father in West Germany.|$|E
