5|$|In 1963, {{the route}} of US25 through the Port Huron area was realigned. In the process, that highway {{replaced}} its alternate route, and the former alignment through downtown was redesignated as a business loop. This arrangement lasted until 1973 when US25 itself was decommissioned in Michigan. The former routing of Bus. US25 through downtown Port Huron became part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> M-25.

5|$|The {{entirety}} of modern-day NY164 was originally designated as NY312 in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. When the NY312 designation was shifted south {{to its current}} location {{in the town of}} Southeast , its former routing in Patterson became part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> NY216, which connected with its current routing by way of modern NY311, NY292 and NY55.

5|$|These moves {{initiated}} the Siege of Tobruk. Although isolated by land, the garrison was {{supplied by the}} Royal Navy and the first Axis attacks failed to take the port.

5|$|A {{least one}} {{transportation}} {{study in the}} early 1970s identified the highway north of Novi as M-275. The Oakland County Road Commission, local land developers, and local politicians supported building a highway along the route of M-275 {{to open up the}} area for development. After the January 1977 cancelation of M-275 as a full freeway, the state explored building the highway as a parkway instead. This parkway concept allowed at-grade intersections that would have not been permitted had the highway been built as a full freeway, and included more landscaping and less grade separation. In September 1977, the State Transportation Commission ordered MDOT to study alternatives to a freeway in the area, along with the possible widening of I-94 and US23 and the improvement of local roads to handle increased traffic caused by the absence <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> I-275 from the state's freeway network.|$|E
5|$|Amundsen's initial plans {{had focused}} on the Arctic and the conquest of the North Pole by means <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> drift in an icebound ship. He {{obtained}} the use of Fridtjof Nansen's polar exploration ship Fram, and undertook extensive fundraising. Preparations for this expedition were disrupted when, in 1909, the rival American explorers Frederick Cook and Robert E. Peary each claimed to have reached the North Pole. Amundsen then changed his plan and began {{to prepare for a}} conquest of the South Pole; uncertain {{of the extent to which}} the public and his backers would support him, he kept this revised objective secret. When he set out in June1910, he led even his crew to believe they were embarking on an Arctic drift, and revealed their true Antarctic destination only when Fram was leaving their last port of call, Madeira.|$|E
5|$|Astrometric {{observations}} {{with the}} Hubble Space Telescope measured an inclination of 53° {{of the outer}} planet d, though this result relies on the precise orbital parameters which have been substantially revised since this was published. The observed transits of e suggest an orbit normal inclined within 9° to the line-of-light, and a possible detection of the transit <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> atmosphere around 55 Cancri b would, if confirmed, imply that it too is in an orbit that is close to edge-on. Between them, no measurement of c's nor f's inclination has been made. It had been thought that with five planets, the system cannot deviate far from coplanar {{in order to maintain}} stability. An attempt to measure the spin-orbit misalignment of the innermost planet reported that it was in a nearly polar orbit, but this interpretation of the data has since been challenged by a subsequent study, with noted inconsistencies between the implied and measured stellar rotation.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{completion}} of the freeways in the Port Huron area, the route of the business loop was part of US Highway25 (US25). After the freeway was completed in the area, the former route was redesignated Business US25 (Bus. US25) in 1964. The US25 designation was decommissioned in 1973, and the former Bus. US25 through the area was designated as part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> M-25. In 1986, the BL I-94 designation was created, and the former BS I-69 was extended with it through downtown Port Huron.

5|$|Comets are {{distinguished}} from asteroids {{by the presence}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>extended,</b> gravitationally unbound atmosphere surrounding their central nucleus. This atmosphere has parts termed the coma (the central part immediately surrounding the nucleus) and the tail (a typically linear section consisting of dust or gas blown out from the coma by the Sun's light pressure or outstreaming solar wind plasma). However, extinct comets that have passed close to the Sun many times have lost nearly all of their volatile ices and dust and may come to resemble small asteroids. Asteroids {{are thought to have}} a different origin from comets, having formed inside the orbit of Jupiter rather than in the outer Solar System. The discovery of main-belt comets and active centaur minor planets has blurred the distinction between asteroids and comets.|$|E

5|$|Following her fiftieth {{birthday}} in May 1767, Maria Theresa contracted smallpox from her daughter-in-law, Maria Josepha of Bavaria. She survived, {{but the new}} empress did not.

The Archduchess started showing smallpox rash two days after visiting the crypt and soon died. Maria Carolina was to replace her as the pre-determined bride of King Ferdinand IV of Naples. Maria Theresa blamed herself for her daughter's death {{for the rest of her}} life because, at the time, the concept <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> incubation period was largely unknown and it was believed that Maria Josepha had caught smallpox from the body of the late empress.|$|E
5|$|From 1911 to 1921, the north–south {{section of}} modern NY251 near Scottsville {{was part of}} Route15, an {{unsigned}} legislative route assigned by the New York State Legislature.
