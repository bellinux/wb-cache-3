40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} two different classes of Matt-Painted pottery attributed to the 8 th century B. C. from the sanctuary on the Timpone della Motta in the Sibaritide (CS), Calabria, southern Italy. Matt-Painted pottery was widely produced in southern Italy during the early Iron Age, and finds from many indigenous sites underline {{that it was one}} of the favored pottery types both for dining and storage purposes. The term Matt-Painted refers to handmade vessels of typical indigenous shapes with applied decoration in a matt dark paint. Traditional archaeological research divides Matt-painted pottery into a range of regional classes based on the decorative styles of each region. The thousands of fragments from the sanctuary on the Timpone della Motta, together with the finds of Matt-Painted vessels in indigenous graves and houses, show that two predominant styles were present in the Sibaritide. These two styles have been named the Undulating Band Style (Matt-Painted stile a Bande <b>Ondulate)</b> and the Fringe Style (Matt-Painted stile a frange) based on their many decorative elements. Twenty-five fragments of Matt-Painted pottery (17 fragments of the Undulating Style Band class, which included, one over-fired sample, and 8 fragments of the Fringe Style class) have been submitted to petrographical analysis including optical microscopy, mineralogical XRD analysis and chemical XRF analysis in order to determine their provenances. The results show that the compositions of the clay fabric of the Undulating Band Style and the Fringe Style are similar. Another important aim was to clarify whether the raw material used in the manufacture of the vessels corresponds to local clay deposits. For this purpose, the Matt-painted samples were compared to previously collected samples of clay sediments around the archaeological site. Firing tests conducted on representative samples of these raw materials evidenced morphological, mineralogical and textural similarities with the studied ceramics. Finally, the SEM micro-morphological study, which determines firing temperatures, was carried out in order to distinguish between different production techniques...|$|R

40|$|Un corte de la ruta nacional 60, 500 m al oeste de Villa Mervil (Sierras de Mazán, La Rioja) muestra el contacto entre las Formaciones Salicas y Las Cumbres, con {{excelente}} exposición de la arquitectura fluvial que pudo ser extendida en tres dimensiones y por más de 700 m en sentido N-S, a ambos lados de la ruta. El corte muestra el contacto entre las Formaciones Salicas (Plioceno) y Las Cumbres (Plio-Pleistoceno). Pueden ser reconocidos cinco estadios de sedimentación: A-S, el inferior, constituido por areniscas friables fluviales y eólicas; F, de capas tabulares consistentes en limos de barreal y areniscas de planicie de distributarios (escorrenteras y barras efímeras) con abundantes calcretos y rizoconcreciones; B, el mejor preservado y que ha permitido el análisis 3 D, de conglomerados arenosos, que corta profundamente los dos estadios inferiores. El Estadio B está organizado en una serie de mesoformas de canal, con barrancas izquierdas (al Oeste) bien definidas. En su etapa final de abandono (Estadio L), fue rellenado por capas tabulares de arenas finas limos pardos, que contienen una arcilita verde y una capa de micrita blanca, que pueden asignarse a un depósito lacustre somero. Finalmente yace sobre todo el conjunto anterior, el Estadio C, de conglomerados finos arenosos que forman un extenso sistema de canales y planicie aluvial pero mal representado en estos afloramientos. Las particularidades de estos depósitos pueden ser comparadas con expresiones locales del ambiente actual: el río Pituil (al oeste de la Sierra de Velasco) la llanura arenosa del Bolsón de Pipanaco y el barreal del Señor de la Peña, donde impera un clima árido con una escasas lluvias estivales, indicado condiciones climáticas similares. A cut {{along the}} National Road 60, 400 m {{west of the}} Mervil Village, a small town located {{at the southern end}} of the "Bolsón de Pipanaco" (Pampean Ranges of NW-Argentina) unveils a 3 -D fluvial and eolian architecture in beds that belong to the stratigraphic passage between the Salicas (Pliocene) and Las Cumbres (Plio- Pleistocene) Formations (Fig. 1 and 2). Fossil mammals found in the Salicas Formation belong to the Huayquerian fauna that could be dated in the Pliocene (Bossi et al., 1996). A four-fold classification of contacts hierarchy (Allen, 1983) was used to define individual sedimentary bodies and their associations: order 0, are the contacts between laminas within a laminaset; order 1 are the contacts between laminasets (represented by parallel or crossbedded cogenetic packages); order 2 contacts, cut order 1 contacts and embrace bedded packages or storeys, limited themselves by order 1 contacts, that show a similar genetic emplacement (similar features in outcrops); finally the order 3 contacts, cut and embrace sedimentary bodies limited by order 2 contacts, defining major groups or stages. Five distinct stages were recognized (Fig. 3) : a lower A-S stage, covered by an extended floodplain F stage, cut deeply by the gravelly stage B, partially filled by L stage, and covered by the fluvial gravelly C stage at top (Fig. 4 and 5). The sandy A-S stage consists of channel and sandflat deposits formed by alternating fluvial (A) and eolian (S) storeys. Facies assamblage "A" is an association of 9 storeys (Fig. 3) composed of moderate sorted massive or cross-bedded sandstones, with few subrounded pebbles (schists and granites) in or near their concave bases. Most of the A storeys bottoms, are covered by a 1 - 5 cm thick silty shale drapes slightly disturbed or forming clay galls partially curled and/or removed (Fig. 4 b and c). The facies assemblage S, is an association of 6 storeys (painted white in Fig. 5 b and c) formed by well-sorted fine to medium size sandstones with occasional mud intraclasts (pebble sizes, not eolian materials probably incorporated by gravity collapse or sudden water sheets). The meter thick silty "F 1 " storey (Fig. 4 b and e) is composed of 10 to 11 tabular decimeter slightly endurated beds, interpreted as playa lake ("barreal") deposits by comparation with very similar sediments that fill the nearby barreal "El Señor de la Peña" a typical endorheic depression. This "F 1 " horizon is the source of most irregular blocks found at the foot of the left margin bank cuts of the B stage. The F 2 storey (Figs. 3 and 4 b) is composed of 0. 90 m tabular to lenticular coarse sandstone horizon crowded of calcretes and rhyzoconcretions defining a paleosol horizon. The F 3 storey is also composed of massive to crossbedded ill-sorted pebble coarse sandstones. Both F 2 and F 3 storeys were deposited by sudden floodings not conected to visible channel locations. The F 3 storey is not related with the F 2 storey calcretization. There are six irregular and lenticular storeys in the "B" stage, defined by concave and convex stratification designs. These storeys could be considered mesoforms in the sense of Bridge (1985, 1993) of the macroform "B". A close correlation of the contacts shown in the two walls of the road cut associated with contact orientation measurements and paleocurrents, allowed to built models of the 3 D situation in several evolution steps starting with storey B 2 ending up in storey B 6 (Figs. 6 a-c). The B channel stage is deeply incised on the F and A-S stages indicating a change of the equilibrium profile. The B stage itself, represented by storeys B 5 and B 6, were mapped beyond the road cut for an extension of 700 m (in N-S sense) yielding a map that shows a NE-trending low sinuosity river with cut banks, lateral bar deposits, overbank deposits deposits with variable width. The last block (Fig. 6 d) shows the abandon "L" stage of lacustrine fillings (see Fig. 3 for stratigraphy relations and Fig. 4 for details), composed of at leat four storeys, three of them (L 1, L 2 and L 3) are fillings of the central part of the pond and a fourth (L 4) a clinoform, is a lateral deposit. The stage C outcrops at the top of the wall cuts covering though a third order contact, the stages F, L and B. It is composed of fine to medium size fluvial gravels without visible bank cuts. The very limited lateral and vertical exposures preclude it, from a further discussion. Most paleocurrent measurements were taken in the axis of concave structures (crossbeddings) and the points where the order 2 contacts merge into the basal order 3 contact. The point of merging of the order 2 and 3 contacts in convex stratified bodies, indicates the position of the bar structure, the paleocurrents at their bases show the local direction of the bar slope in this particular stage of growing (Fig. 7). Converging or diverging paleocurrent patterns at the outcrop face combined with vertical textural variations, unveil the position of the outcrop cut in relation to the hidden 3 D structure. Most of the mapped architectural features yielded also paleocurrents measurements on cross-bedding and pebble imbrications that were integrated with the textural and structural evidences (Fig. 9). The scheme of Fig. 7 was used in the model of Fig. 9 to position the bar designs on the plan. The model of Fig. 9 b, is a cartoon of a slightly <b>ondulate</b> landscape crossed from SSW to NNE by the B stage river channel. Fig. 8 shown the succesive bank cuts created by the B stage channel during its migration to west. Calcretes and rhizoconcretions over convex or tabular gravels storeys, mapped as inside features of channel "B", indicate an ephemeral regime with riparian vegetation (Fig. 9). The Pituil River (Fig. 10) draining the northwest end of the Velasco Range and the sandy plains located north of the Mazán Range and near the center of the "Bolsón de Pipanaco" were used as modern analogs of the ancient Mervil channel system (stages B and A-S respectively). The structural details shown by the Salicas Formation at the Mervil area around the road cut, are also present in the modern analogs, indicating a similar arid climate...|$|R

The average of the three factors LS derived from three different MDE presented similar values as well as the average of three USLE generated. This result seems to be associate with the terrain characteristic of the APA, which is flat and gently <b>ondulated,</b> since the influence of spatial resolution in the LS factor is more pronounced in MDE with high spatial resolution and on sloping land.

Portanto, objetivou-se, neste trabalho, avaliar os esforços de cinco diferentes mecanismos de abertura de sulco de semeadoras de plantio direto, variando a carga vertical. O experimento foi instalado num solo classificado como Nitossolo Vermelho Distroférrico. O delineamento experimental utilizado foi o de blocos ao acaso, em esquema fatorial 5 x 4, constituídos dos seguintes fatores: cinco mecanismos de abertura de sulco (disco liso - DL, disco corrugado -DC, disco ondulado - DO, disco duplo - DD e haste sulcadora - F) e quatro cargas verticais (750, 1500, 2250 e 3000 N). Para mensurar as forças nos tratamentos estudados foi utilizado um dinamômetro com sensibilidade nas direções horizontal, lateral, vertical. A avaliação mostrou que a interação entre mecanismos de abertura de sulco e carga vertical não foi significativa, entretanto os fatores foram significativos quando analisados individualmente. A haste promoveu a maior mobilização do solo com menor requerimento de esforço horizontal, atingindo as maiores profundidades de trabalho. O trabalho mostrou que a carga vertical influenciou a profundidade de trabalho dos mecanismos de abertura de sulco. Os mecanismos de abertura de sulco do tipo disco necessitam de maior força vertical para penetrar no solo. The {{individual evaluation}} of mechanisms for opening furrows {{to drop the}} seeds in a no-tillage seeders cultivation assists the companies in the sizing of opening tools of the ground, that search for minor energy petition and for diminishing the ground area mobilized.

The experiment was installed in one ground classified as Dystroferric Red Nitosol. The used experimental delineation was of the one randomized blocks in a factorial project 5 x 4, constituted a the following factors: five mechanisms of furrow opening (even disk - DL, corrugated disk - DC, <b>ondulated</b> disk - DO, double disk DD and furrow rod - F) and four vertical loads (750, 1500, 2250 and 3000 N). To measure the forces in the studied treatments a dynamometer with sensitivity in the directions was used horizontal, lateral and vertical direction. The evaluation showed that the interaction between mechanisms of opening of ridge and vertical load was not significant, however the factors were significant when analyzed individually.
