50|$|There {{are three}} {{principal}} metrics {{of how well}} a current mirror will perform {{as part of a}} larger circuit. The first measure is the static error, the difference between the input and output currents expressed as a fraction of the input current. Minimizing this difference is critical in such applications of a current mirror as the differential to single-ended output signal conversion in a differential amplifier stage because this difference controls the common mode and power supply rejection ratios. The second measure is the output impedance of the current source or equivalently its inverse, the <b>output</b> <b>conductance.</b> This impedance affects stage gain when a current source is used as an active load and affects common mode gain when the source provides the tail current of a differential pair. The last metric is the pair of minimum voltages from the common terminal, usually a power rail connection, to the input and output terminals that are required for proper operation of the circuit. These voltages affect the headroom to the power supply rails that is available for the circuitry in which the current mirror is embedded.|$|E

Two effects causing the <b>output</b> <b>conductance</b> variation with frequency, namely self-heating and source-to-drain coupling through the substrate, are discussed and qualitatively compared. Notwithstanding the use of ultra-thin BOX, which allows for improved heat evacuation from the channel to the Si substrate underneath BOX, a self-heating-related transition clearly appears in the <b>output</b> <b>conductance</b> frequency response. Furthermore, {{the use of an}} ultra thin BOX results in an increase of the substrate-related <b>output</b> <b>conductance</b> variation in frequency.

In this paper, the design of non-uniform downsized distributed amplifiers (DAs) is explored. Conventional DAs employ a topology in which induc-tors or T-lines separate the gain stages, yet the output currents from individual stages combine additively [1]. Major sources of performance degradation in any DA are the non-zero frequency-dependent loss of the inductors and the non-zero output conduc-tance of the gain stages, which in turn decrease gain and BW. Previous works on distributed circuits do not consider the effect of inductor loss and <b>output</b> <b>conductances</b> of the constituent gain stages on the DA topology, leading us to an important question: Considering non-zero circuit losses, does a conventional DA with an optimum number of identical gain stages and segmenta...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{methodology}} for analog design reuse is proposed. The basic {{idea is to}} keep the circuit topology unchanged while automatically modifying the MOSFETs aspect ratio in order to control the transistor transconductances gm and <b>output</b> <b>conductances</b> gDS. If gm’s and gDS’s of each transistor are kept unchanged through the scaling procedure, we show that the overall frequency behavior of the scaled circuit remains very similar to the original one. The approach is very simple and it is suitable for the scaling of analog circuits. No input and output terminals have to be defined and it can be straightforwardly implemented in an automatic scaling tool. When this approach fails, more complex iterative numerical loops may be adopted. In order to validate and compare the scaling approaches, several linear and nonlinear circuits were scaled from a 0. 25 -um, 2. 5 -V voltage supply to a 0. 15 -um, 1. 2 -V voltage supply in standard CMOS technologies...|$|R

40|$|A new {{formalism}} {{to describe}} metabolic fluxes {{as well as}} membrane transport processes was developed. The new flux equations are comparable to other phenomenological laws. Michaelis-Menten like expressions, as well as flux equations of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, {{can be regarded as}} special cases of these new equations. For metabolic network modeling, variable conductances and driving forces are required to enable pathway control and to allow a rapid response to perturbations. When applied to oxidative phosphorylation, results of simulations show that whole oxidative phosphorylation cannot be described as a two-flux-system according to nonequilibrium thermodynamics, although all coupled reactions per se fulfill the equations of this theory. Simulations show that activation of ATP-coupled load reactions plus glucose oxidation is brought about by an increase of only two different conductances: a [Ca 2 +] dependent increase of cytosolic load conductances, and an increase of phosphofructokinase conductance by [AMP], which in turn becomes increased through [ADP] generation by those load reactions. In ventricular myocytes, this feedback mechanism is sufficient to increase cellular power output and O 2 consumption several fold, without any appreciable impairment of energetic parameters. Glucose oxidation proceeds near maximal power output, since transformed input and <b>output</b> <b>conductances</b> are nearly equal, yielding an efficiency of about 0. 5. This conductance matching is fulfilled also by glucose oxidation of β-cells.

40|$|Field {{emitters}} are {{an exciting}} technology for high-frequency, high-power applications {{because of their}} excellent free space electron transport, and their potential for high current density and high current, especially when they are used in an array format. However, a major challenge preventing {{the widespread use of}} this technology are the spatial and temporal variations that arise from non-uniformity in emitter tip radius and work function, respectively. To address the problems, various methods of controlling the supply of electrons to the emitter have been developed. One method of current limiting is the vertical ungated field effect transistor (FET), which uses the channel pinch-o and velocity saturation of carriers in silicon combined with a high aspect ratio to provide an effective method of controlling current. To reduce the operating voltage, and likewise the energy spread of the emitted electrons, we created vertical ungated FET current limiters that were 100 nm in diameter, 8 m tall, and had a pitch of 1 m that were patterned using optical lithography. These devices demonstrated excellent current saturation, with <b>output</b> <b>conductances</b> lower than 10 ?? 11 S. In addition, a fabrication process for building nano-sharp emitters on these high aspect ratio pillars was developed. Using this process tip radii of less than 6 nm were obtained on top of the pillars.

40|$|A {{number of}} spintronic {{junction}} transistors, that exploit the spin {{degree of freedom}} of an electron {{in addition to the}} charge degree of freedom, have been proposed to provide simultaneous non-volatile storage and signal processing functionality. Here, we show that some of these transistors unfortunately may not have sufficient voltage and current gains for signal processing. This is primarily because of a large <b>output</b> ac <b>conductance</b> and poor isolation between input and output. The latter also hinders unidirectional propagation of logic signal from the input of a logic gate to the output. Other versions of these transistors appear to have better gain and isolation, but not better than those of a conventional transistor. Therefore, these devices may not improve state-of-the-art signal processing capability, although they may provide additional functionality by offering non-volatile storage.

Previous {{research}} on MWNTs/SiO 2 humidity sensing film by our work group has proved that MWNTs sensor {{has a different}} response mechanism to humidity at AC testing signals and shows greater testing stability and higher sensitivity, compared with traditional DC signal measurement. An interface circuit for conductive MWNTs/SiO 2 humidity sensor is designed in this paper for humidity detection and prospection in miniaturization and integration. It aims at detecting the sensor’s humidity sensitive conductance signal at AC testing signals, and inhibiting the interference of capacitance signals. The ASIC demodulates the two signals by their phase difference and outputs a direct voltage proportional to conductance.

In particular, motor neuron ion currents may contribute significantly to motor <b>output.</b> Large <b>conductance</b> Ca 2 +-dependent K+ (BK) currents {{play a role in}} action potential repolarization, interspike interval, repetitive and burst firing, burst termination and interburst interval in neurons. Mutations in slowpoke (slo) genes encoding BK channels result in motor disturbances. This study examined the effects of manipulating slo channel expression on rhythmic motor activity using Drosophila larva as a model system. Dual intracellular recordings from adjacent body wall muscles were made during spontaneous crawling-related activity in larvae expressing a slo mutation or a slo RNA interference construct. The incidence and duration of rhythmic activity in slo mutants were similar to wild-type control animals, while the timing of the motor pattern was altered. slo mutants showed decreased burst durations, cycle durations, and quiescence intervals, and increased duty cycles, relative to wild-type. Expressing slo RNAi in identified motor neurons phenocopied many of the effects observed in the mutant, including decreases in quiescence interval and cycle duration. Overall, these results show that altering slo expression in the whole larva, and specifically in motor neurons, changes the frequency of crawling activity.
