5|$|Hail to the Thief was {{produced}} by longtime Radiohead collaborator Nigel Godrich in Los Angeles. To avoid the protracted recording sessions of previous albums, Radiohead recorded Hail to the Thief quickly and focused on recording live takes rather than overdubs. Songwriter Thom Yorke wrote many of the lyrics {{in response to the}} War on Terror and the resurgence <b>of</b> <b>right-wing</b> politics in the west {{at the turn of the}} millennium.|$|E
5|$|McNallen is a {{controversial}} {{figure in the}} Heathen and wider Pagan community. His espousal <b>of</b> <b>right-wing</b> ethnonationalist ideas and his insistence that Heathenry should be reserved for those of Northern European ancestry has resulted in accusations of racism from both Pagans and the mainstream media. Conversely, many on the extreme right of the Heathen movement have {{accused him of being}} a race traitor for his opposition to Neo-Nazism and refusal to endorse white supremacism.|$|E
5|$|During {{his presidential}} campaign, Morales had {{supported}} calls for regional autonomy for Bolivia's departments. As president, {{he changed his}} position, viewing the calls for autonomy – which came from Bolivia's four eastern departments of Santa Cruz, Beni, Pando, and Tarija – as {{an attempt by the}} wealthy bourgeoisie living in these regions to preserve their economic position. He nevertheless agreed to a referendum on regional autonomy, held in July 2006; the four eastern departments voted in favor of autonomy, but Bolivia as a whole voted against it by 57.6%. In September, autonomy activists launched strikes and blockades across eastern Bolivia, resulting in violent clashes with MAS activists. In January 2007, clashes in Cochabamba between activist groups led to fatalities, with Morales' government sending in troops to maintain the peace. The left-indigenous activists formed a Revolutionary Departmental Government, but Morales denounced it as illegal and continued to recognise the legitimacy <b>of</b> <b>right-wing</b> departmental head Manfred Reyes Villa.|$|E

5|$|In 1971, Castro visited Chile, where Marxist President Salvador Allende {{had been}} elected {{as the head of}} a left-wing coalition. Castro {{supported}} Allende's socialist reforms, but warned him <b>of</b> <b>right-wing</b> elements in Chile's military. In 1973, the military led a coup d'état and established a military junta led by Augusto Pinochet. Castro proceeded to Guinea to meet socialist President Sékou Touré, praising him as Africa's greatest leader, and there received the Order of Fidelity to the People. He then went on a seven-week tour visiting leftist allies: Algeria, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, where he was given further awards. On each trip, he was eager to visit factory and farm workers, publicly praising their governments; privately, he urged the regimes to aid revolutionary movements elsewhere, particularly those fighting the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|While the FPÖ is {{currently}} {{not a member}} of any European or international organisations, the party has ties with several European political parties and groupings. From 1978 to 1993, under the party's liberal leadership, the party {{was a member of the}} Liberal International. In the early years of Haider's leadership, meetings were held with figures such as Jean-Marie Le Pen of the French National Front and Franz Schönhuber of the German Republicans. In the late 1990s he however chose to distance himself from Le Pen, and refused to join Le Pen's EuroNat project. Following the FPÖ's entrance in government in 2000, Haider sought to establish his own alliance <b>of</b> <b>right-wing</b> parties. For his project, Haider tried to establish stable cooperations with the Vlaams Blok party in Belgium and the Northern League party in Italy, as well as some other parties and party groupings. In the end, the efforts to establish a new alliance of parties were not successful.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{a holiday}} {{trip to the}} Soviet Union in 1936, he {{remained}} unsympathetic to the popular-front, Leftist politics {{of many of his}} literary and critical contemporaries.

Eventually, Eitam and Levi left the NRP, too, and formed the Renewed Religious National Zionist Party, later renamed Ahi, which would later join the National Union - a Knesset list <b>of</b> <b>right-wing</b> parties.|$|E
25|$|The {{party was}} the first {{successful}} parliamentary party in the Nordic countries to relate philosophically more closely to the French Nouvelle Droite, than to the previous Nordic form <b>of</b> <b>right-wing</b> populism. DPP represented a synthesis of several political currents: the Lutheran movement Tidehverv and its related journal, an intellectual nationalist right from the Danish Association (Den Danske Forening) and conservative populists from the Progress Party.|$|E

25|$|The only deaths, in {{the view}} of Russian observers, to be convincingly {{investigated}} and successfully prosecuted, were the 2010 killing in Moscow of Markelov and Baburova and the 2004 murder in St Petersburg of anthropologist Nikolai Girenko, both attacks the work <b>of</b> <b>right-wing</b> extremists.

25|$|On {{the day of}} Perón's return, a {{crowd of}} left-wing Peronists (estimated at 3.5million) {{gathered}} at the Ezeiza Airport in Buenos Aires to welcome him. Perón was accompanied by Cámpora, whose first measures were to grant amnesty to all political prisoners and re-establish relations with Cuba, helping Fidel Castro break the United States embargo against Cuba. This, along with his social policies, had earned him the opposition <b>of</b> <b>right-wing</b> Peronists, including the trade-unionist bureaucracy.|$|E
25|$|State {{funding was}} {{introduced}} for elected parties. The new system made parties independent of wealthy donors and gave Knesset members more power over party funding, however {{it also made}} them less dependent on existing party structures and able to take their funding elsewhere. Prior to the December 1973 elections, Gahal and a number <b>of</b> <b>right-wing</b> parties united to form the Likud (led by Begin). In the December 1973 elections, Labour won 51 seats, leaving Golda Meir as Prime Minister. The Likud won 39 seats.|$|E

Key examples are Paul Craig Roberts, Dean Baker, and William Lind.|$|E
25|$|Progressives on {{the left}} wing of the PQ {{perceived}} a rightward move by the party towards neoliberalism under Bouchard, Landry and Boisclair. In 2006, a new left-wing party, Québec solidaire, was formed which included many activists who would have formerly been members or supporters of the PQ. Over subsequent elections, the QS would attract increasing support from left-wing sovereigntists disillusioned with the PQ, while on the right, the ADQ and later the Coalition Avenir Québec attracted the votes <b>of</b> <b>right-wing</b> and soft sovereigntists, resulting in the PQ being squeezed from both sides.|$|E
25|$|Venezuela {{was headed}} by a series <b>of</b> <b>right-wing</b> governments for years. In 1992, Hugo Chávez formed a group named Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200 aiming {{to take over the}} government, and {{attempted}} a coup d'état. Later, another coup was performed while Chávez was in prison. Both coup attempts failed and fighting resulted in around 143–300 deaths. Chávez, after receiving a pardon from president Rafael Caldera, later decided to participate in elections and formed the Movement for the Fifth Republic (MVR) party. He won the 1998 Venezuelan presidential elections. The changes started by Chávez were named the Bolivarian Revolution.|$|E
