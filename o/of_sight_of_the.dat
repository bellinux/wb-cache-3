5|$|Before leaving, Shackleton {{instructed}} Frank Wild {{that he was}} {{to assume}} full command as soon as the James Caird departed, and that should the journey fail, he was to attempt to take the party to Deception Island the following spring. The James Caird was launched from Elephant Island on 24 April 1916. The wind was a moderate south-westerly, which aided a swift getaway, and the boat was quickly out <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land.|$|E
5|$|Gibraltar {{was part}} of a 17-ship squadron, keeping four French ships-of-the-line in Fort Royal, Martinique, when on 29April 1781 a 20-ship fleet and a {{merchant}} convoy under Contre-amiral François deGrasse arrived from Brest. Out <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British, deGrasse put a man ashore to swap information with Fort Royal's garrison, and agree on a plan of attack with the blockaded ships.|$|E
5|$|On the {{northern}} end of the battlefield, events had unfolded quite differently. Dampierre's cavalry routed Lannoy's company of light horse; the Italians and the contingent from Gruyères, meanwhile, broke and fled—leaving their officers to be killed—without offering any real resistance to the advancing Imperial infantry. As Cardona's infantry moved past the original French line, Enghien descended on it with the entire body of heavy cavalry under his command; the subsequent engagement took place on the reverse slope of the ridge, out <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rest of the battlefield.|$|E

5|$|With {{the score}} now 2–0 {{in favor of}} Spassky, many {{observers}} believed that the match was over and Fischer would leave Iceland, and, indeed, Fischer looked to board the next plane out of Iceland, only to be dissuaded by his second, William Lombardy. His decision {{to stay in the}} match was attributed by some to another phone call from Kissinger and a deluge of cablegrams to Fischer. Spassky, owing to his sporting spirit and respect and sympathy for Fischer, agreed to play the third game in a small room backstage, out <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spectators. According to Pal Benko and Burt Hochberg, this concession was a psychological mistake by Spassky.|$|E
5|$|Out <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> band members, two of {{the gunmen}} placed a ten-pound (4.5kg) time bomb {{in the rear of}} the minibus. The UVF's plan was that the bomb would explode once the minibus had reached Newry, killing all on board. However, Martin Dillon alleged that the bomb was meant to go off in the Irish Republic. He {{suggested}} that had all gone according to plan, the loyalist extremists would have been able to clandestinely bomb the Republic of Ireland, yet claim that the band were republican bomb-smugglers carrying explosives on behalf of the IRA. They had hoped to embarrass the Government of Ireland, as well as to draw attention to its level of control of the border. This may have resulted in the Irish authorities enforcing tighter controls over the border, thus restricting IRA operations. Dillon opined that another reason the UVF decided to target the Miami Showband was because Irish nationalists held them in high regard; to attack the band was to strike the nationalists indirectly.|$|E
5|$|The show's {{original}} puzzle {{board had}} three rows of 13 manually operated trilons, {{for a total}} of 39 spaces. On December 21, 1981, a larger board with 48 trilons in four rows (11, 13, 13 and 11 trilons) was adopted. This board was surrounded by a double-arched border of lights which flashed {{at the beginning and end}} of the round. Each trilon had three sides: a green side to represent spaces not used by the puzzle, a blank side to indicate a letter that had not been revealed, and a side with a letter on it. While the viewer saw a seamless transition to the next puzzle, with these older boards in segments where more than one puzzle was present, a stop-down of taping took place during which the board was be wheeled offstage and the new puzzle loaded in by hand out <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contestants. On February 24, 1997, the show introduced a computerized puzzle board composed of 52 touch-activated monitors in four rows (12 on the top and bottom rows, 14 in the middle two). To illuminate a letter during regular gameplay, the hostess touches the right edge of the monitor to reveal it. The computerized board obviated the stop-downs, allowing tapings to finish quicker at a lower cost to the production company.|$|E

25|$|An {{eclipsing binary}} star is a binary star in which the orbit plane of the two stars lies so nearly in the line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{observer}} that the components undergo mutual eclipses.

25|$|Meanwhile, {{having seen}} the {{movement}} of Ayres's and Crawford's brigades toward the Confederate line, Johnson allowed Hunton's and Stansel's brigades to advance to meet the Union formations even though McGowan's brigade {{on the far right}} was not ready. The Confederates were able to approach the Union force while screened by woods north of White Oak Road. As Ayres's division, led by Winthrop's brigade, advanced across a field toward White Oak Road with the intention of seizing advanced Confederate rifle pits, the Confederates began to fire from the woods, out <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Union force.|$|E
25|$|Radial {{velocity}} is {{the velocity}} component of orbital velocity {{in the line}} <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> observer. Unlike true orbital velocity, radial velocity can be determined from Doppler spectroscopy of spectral lines {{in the light of}} a star, or from variations in the arrival times of pulses from a radio pulsar. A binary system is called a single-lined spectroscopic binary if the radial motion of only one of the two binary components can be measured. In this case, a lower limit on the mass of the other (unseen) component can be determined.|$|E
25|$|Radio-frequency {{identification}} (RFID) uses {{electromagnetic fields}} to automatically identify and track tags attached to objects. The tags contain electronically stored information. Passive tags collect energy {{from a nearby}} RFID reader's interrogating radio waves. Active tags have a local power source (such as a battery) and may operate hundreds of meters from the RFID reader. Unlike a barcode, the tag need not be within the line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reader, {{so it may be}} embedded in the tracked object. RFID is one method for Automatic Identification and Data Capture (AIDC).|$|E

25|$|The rising tone {{of panic}} in these {{messages}} convinced Broome {{and every other}} recipient that Tirpitz was approaching. Since {{the first of the}} messages was not directly addressed to Broome, he was not immediately aware that the cruisers were withdrawing. In fact, although they should have been out <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> convoy, because of navigational errors they were clearly visible as they worked up to full speed. Convinced that the cruisers were about to engage enemy ships, Broome collected the miscellany of destroyers in EG1 and attached them to the cruisers, while the convoy scattered.|$|E

The other arrow of the pair locates the ball relative to the center of the carousel, providing the position of the ball as seen by the rotating observer. By following this procedure for several positions, the trajectory in the rotating frame of reference is established as shown by the curved path in the right-hand panel.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} of this exercise {{because it is}} such a common and necessary command for a dog. Generally the handler will order the dog to sit and stay and then the judge will order the handler {{to walk away from the}} dog. Depending on the level of the competition the judge will order the handler to: walk around the ring, walk to the other side of the ring and wait for an order to return, or walk out <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dog and wait for an order to return. In the later two cases the length of time before the judge orders the handler to return, and the time the dog must remain sitting, increases depending on the class the team is competing in. This exercise can also be performed in a group where as many as 10 dogs may perform the exercise simultaneously. In any case should a dog break the sit by lying down or getting up to walk around the team will usually fail the exercise and receive a non qualifying score for the class.|$|E
