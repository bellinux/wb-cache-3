5|$|Large-scale {{economic}} issues {{played a role}} in the decline of the maritime fur trade and the China trade in general. Before the 19th century, Chinese demand for Western raw materials or manufactured goods was small, but bullion (also known as specie) was accepted, resulting in a general drain of precious metals from the West to China. The situation reversed in the early 19th century for a variety of reasons. Western demand for Chinese goods declined relative to new options (for example, coffee from the West Indies began to replace tea in the United States), while Chinese demand for Western items increased, such as for English manufactures, American cotton goods, and opium which was outlawed but smuggled into China on a large and increasing scale. Before long, China was being drained of specie and saturated with Western goods. At the same time, intense speculation in the China trade by American and British merchant companies began. By the 1820s, too many firms were competing for an <b>overstocked</b> market, resulting in bankruptcies and consolidation. The inevitable commercial crisis struck in 1826–27, after the Panic of 1825. Tea prices plummeted and the China trade's volume collapsed by about a third. By this time, the old maritime fur trade on the Northwest Coast and the Old China Trade itself were dying. The final blow came with the depression of 1841–43, following the Panic of 1837.|$|E

During the same year, Overstock.com acquired naming rights to the former Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum, renaming it Overstock.com Coliseum.

25|$|In {{addition}} to bioload/chemical considerations, aquarists {{also consider the}} mutual compatibility of the fish. For instance, predatory fish are usually not kept with small, passive species, and territorial fish are often unsuitable tankmates for shoaling species. Furthermore, fish tend to fare better if given tanks conducive to their size. That is, large fish need large tanks and small fish can do well in smaller tanks. Lastly, the tank can become overcrowded without being <b>overstocked.</b> In other words, the aquarium can be suitable with regard to filtration capacity, oxygen load, and water, yet still be so crowded that the inhabitants are uncomfortable.|$|E

25|$|By now {{the rate}} of {{production}} of religious art was noticeably slowing down. After a spate of building and re-building in the Baroque period, Catholic countries were mostly clearly <b>overstocked</b> with churches, monasteries and convents, {{in the case of}} some places such as Naples, almost absurdly so. The Church was now less important as a patron than royalty and the aristocracy, and the middle class demand for art, mostly secular, was increasing rapidly. Artists could now have a successful career painting portraits, landscapes, still lifes or other genre specialisms, without ever painting a religious subject – something unusual hitherto unusual in the Catholic countries, though long the norm in Protestant ones. The number of sales of paintings, metalwork and other church fittings to private collectors increased during the century, especially in Italy, where the Grand Tour gave rise to networks of dealers and agents. Leonardo da Vinci's London Virgin of the Rocks was sold to the Scottish artist and dealer Gavin Hamilton by the church in Milan that it was painted for in about 1781; the version in the Louvre having apparently been diverted from the same church three centuries earlier by Leonardo himself, to go to the King of France.|$|E

500|$|After the 1947 season ended, Indians owner Bill Veeck put Seerey on {{a strict}} diet and {{exercise}} regimen for the offseason, stating {{that he had to}} lose 35 pounds if he wanted to remain on the team. By the start of spring training, he had reached his goal of 195 pounds, and felt like he had an easier time swinging the baseball bat as a result. After a good month of spring training, Boudreau named him the starter in right field for the 1948 season, saying that [...] "he'll be in there until he stops hitting." [...] Shortly afterwards, Seerey was removed from the starting lineup, and he ended up playing 10 games for the Indians before being traded. On June 2, Seerey was traded with Al Gettel to the White Sox for Bob Kennedy due to his inconsistency as well as an <b>overstocked</b> group of outfielders on the roster.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 18th century, {{farmland}} was run {{through an open}} field system, which were commonly <b>overstocked</b> and made trying experimental methods very difficult; enclosed farms, on the other hand, were higher quality and useful for experimentation, {{with the result that}} they commanded a rent almost double a similarly sized open field. Compounding this problem, many of the enclosures were split up into strips, with the result that ownership was unclear. Between 1776 and 1816, Coke rapidly bought strips of land near his estates and had them enclosed. Much of this came during the Napoleonic Wars, where grain prices (and therefore farming profits) peaked. Coke was influenced by [...] "Turnip" [...] Townshend, who had owned a nearby estate who promoted crop rotation and farm improvement. Along with enclosure, marling and improved grasses, Townshend's improvements resulted in [...] "a course of husbandry utterly unlike that practised a hundred years ago".|$|E
500|$|Nielsen's {{career began}} in {{dramatic}} roles on television during [...] "Television's Golden Age", appearing in 46 live programs in 1950 alone. He said there [...] "was very little gold, we only got $75 or $100 per show." [...] He narrated documentaries and commercials {{and most of}} his early work as a dramatic actor was uneventful. Hal Erickson of Allmovie noted that [...] "much of Nielsen's early work was undistinguished; he was merely a handsome leading man in an industry <b>overstocked</b> with handsome leading men." [...] In 1956 he made his feature film debut in the Michael Curtiz-directed musical film The Vagabond King. In the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Nielsen remembered Curtiz as [...] "a sadist, a charming sadist, but a sadist". Nielsen called this film [...] "The Vagabond Turkey". Though the film was not a success, producer Nicholas Nayfack offered him an audition for the science fiction film Forbidden Planet, resulting in Nielsen's taking a long contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM).|$|E

[...] The cannon fire by this small force killed five and wounded another 31 of the besieging British. [...] Captain Louis-Philippe Le Dossu d'Hébécourt, who had been left in command of the fort, judged on the evening of July 26 {{that it was time to}} leave. [...] His men aimed the fort's guns at its walls, laid mines, and put down a powder trail to the <b>overstocked</b> powder magazine. [...] They then lit the fuse and abandoned the fort, leaving the French flag flying. [...] The British were notified of this action by the arrival of French deserters. [...] General Amherst offered 100 guineas to any man willing to enter the works to find and douse the fuse; but no one was willing to take up the offer. [...] The entire works went off late that evening with a tremendous roar. [...] The powder magazine was destroyed, and a number of wooden structures caught fire due to flying embers, but the fort's walls were not badly damaged. [...] After the explosion, some of Gage's light infantry rushed into the fort and retrieved the French flag. [...] Fires in the fort were not entirely extinguished for two days.|$|E
500|$|The parish of Exmoor Forest {{was part}} of the Hundred of Williton and Freemanners. During the Middle Ages, sheep farming for the wool trade came to {{dominate}} the economy. The wool was spun into thread on isolated farms and collected by merchants to be woven, fulled, dyed and finished in thriving towns such as Dunster. The land started to be enclosed and from the 17th century onwards larger estates developed, leading to establishment of areas of large regular shaped fields. During the 16th and 17th centuries the commons were <b>overstocked</b> with agisted livestock, from farmers outside the immediate area who were charged for the privilege. This led to disputes about the number of animals allowed and the enclosure of land. In the mid-17th century James Boevey was the warden. The house that he built at Simonsbath {{was the only one in}} the forest for 150 years. When the royal forest was sold off in 1818, John Knight bought the Simonsbath House and the accompanying farm for £50,000. He set about converting the royal forest into agricultural land. He and his family also built most of the large farms in the central section of the moor as well as [...] of metalled access roads to Simonsbath and a [...] wall around his estate, much of which still survives.|$|E
