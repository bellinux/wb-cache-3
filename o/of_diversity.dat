5|$|Cacti inhabit diverse regions, from coastal plains to high {{mountain}} areas. With one exception, they are {{native to the}} Americas, where their range extends from Patagonia to British Columbia and Alberta in western Canada. A number of centers <b>of</b> <b>diversity</b> exist. For cacti adapted to drought, the three main centers are Mexico and the southwestern United States; the southwestern Andes, where they are found in Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina; and eastern Brazil, away from the Amazon Basin. Tree-living epiphytic and climbing cacti necessarily have different centers <b>of</b> <b>diversity,</b> as they require moister environments. They are mainly found in the coastal mountains and Atlantic forests of southeastern Brazil; in Bolivia, which is the center <b>of</b> <b>diversity</b> for the subfamily Rhipsalideae; and in forested regions of Central America, where the climbing Hylocereeae are most diverse.|$|E
5|$|At an {{international}} level Scouting perceives {{one of its}} roles as the promotion of international harmony and peace. Various initiatives are in train towards achieving this aim including the development of activities that benefit the wider community, challenge prejudice and encourage tolerance <b>of</b> <b>diversity.</b> Such programs include co-operation with non-Scouting organisations including various NGOs, the United Nations and religious institutions {{as set out in}} The Marrakech Charter.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Rasmussen {{was part}} of a large multi-institutional {{collaboration}} investigating biodiversity hotspots, which have a prominent role in conservation. The study assessed locations quantitatively for three criteria of bird diversity – species richness, the level of threat, and the number of endemism species. The results demonstrated that hotspots did not show the same geographical distribution for each factor. Only 2.5% of hotspot areas are common to all three aspects <b>of</b> <b>diversity,</b> with over 80% of hotspots registering on only one criterion. Each criterion explained less than 24% of the variation in the other factors, suggesting that even within a single taxonomic class, different mechanisms are responsible for the origin and maintenance of various aspects <b>of</b> <b>diversity.</b> Consequently, the different types of hotspots also vary greatly in their utility as conservation tools.|$|E

40|$|Master's thesis Cultural Diversity and its Protection in International Law {{focuses on}} the concept <b>of</b> {{cultural}} <b>diversity</b> within international law and examines the various means of its protection and promotion. Although the theme <b>of</b> cultural <b>diversity</b> is relatively new for international law, the issue developed significantly in the last fifteen years. This thesis therefore outlines {{the development of the}} protection <b>of</b> cultural <b>diversity</b> in an international environment and focuses on its current relevance. The first part of the thesis describes the historical development of the protection <b>of</b> cultural <b>diversity</b> from the perspective of international law. It {{focuses on the}} concept <b>of</b> cultural <b>diversity</b> within the framework of international organizations. The thesis then presents various means of protection and preservation <b>of</b> cultural <b>diversity,</b> be it earlier documents dealing with the protection <b>of</b> cultural <b>diversity</b> or the UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion <b>of</b> the <b>Diversity</b> <b>of</b> Cultural Expressions from 2005, {{which is one of the}} most important milestones in these efforts.

5|$|The Constitution Act of 1867 was {{designed}} to meet the growing calls of Canadians for autonomy from British rule, while avoiding the overly strong decentralization that contributed to the Civil War in the United States. The compromises made by the Fathers of Confederation set Canadians on a path to bilingualism, and this in turn contributed to an acceptance <b>of</b> <b>diversity.</b>|$|E
5|$|After Sesame Streets first season, {{its critics}} forced its {{producers}} and researchers to address more overtly such affective goals as social competence, tolerance <b>of</b> <b>diversity,</b> and nonaggressive ways of resolving conflict. These issues were addressed through interpersonal disputes among its Street characters. During the 1980s, the show incorporated the real-life {{experiences of the}} show's cast and crew, including the death of Will Lee (Mr. Hooper) and the pregnancy of Sonia Manzano (Maria) to address affective concerns. In later seasons, Sesame Street addressed real-life disasters such as the September 11 terrorist attacks and Hurricane Katrina.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{subspecies}} are recognized, {{there are}} morphological differences in wood turtles between areas. Individuals {{found in the}} west of its geographic range (areas like the Great Lakes and the Midwest United States) have a paler complexion {{on the inside of}} the legs and underside of the neck than ones found in the east (places including the Appalachian Mountains, New York, and Pennsylvania). Genetic analysis has also revealed that southern populations have less genetic diversity than the northern; however, both exhibit a fair amount <b>of</b> <b>diversity</b> considering the decline in numbers that have occurred during previous ice ages.|$|E
40|$|This book is an {{investigation}} of Analytical Metaphysics that seeks the causal explanation <b>of</b> the <b>diversity</b> <b>of</b> beings. The conceptual framework in which the reflections of this research are developed is that of Tomás de Aquino's hilemorphism, which is based, in turn, on Aristotle. According to this conceptual framework, the <b>diversity</b> <b>of</b> the forms is the cause <b>of</b> the <b>diversity</b> <b>of</b> the entities of the universe, and not the <b>diversity</b> <b>of</b> the matter. Aquinas in 'Super Boethium De Trinitate' argues that the causes <b>of</b> the <b>diversity</b> <b>of</b> entities are quantitatively determined matter and form, and rejects the Platonic theory according to which only matter is the cause <b>of</b> the <b>diversity</b> <b>of</b> things, while the form is only a cause of unity. The Platonic theory leaves open an abyss between unity and multiplicity. Eleonore Stump maintains that {{it is easier to}} repeat the thesis of Aquinas that the matter individuates, than to understand well what he wants to say...|$|R

5|$|Both written {{history and}} {{molecular}} genetic {{studies indicate that}} the domestic carrot has a single origin in Central Asia. Its wild ancestors probably originated in Persia (regions of which are now Iran and Afghanistan), which remains the centre <b>of</b> <b>diversity</b> for the wild carrot Daucus carota. A naturally occurring subspecies of the wild carrot was presumably bred selectively over the centuries to reduce bitterness, increase sweetness and minimise the woody core; this process produced the familiar garden vegetable.|$|E
5|$|Compared to {{most other}} {{important}} crops, {{little is known}} about the domestication, dispersal and cultivation history of the cowpea. Although there is no archaeological evidence for early cowpea cultivation the centre <b>of</b> <b>diversity</b> of the cultivated cowpea is West Africa, leading an early consensus that this is the likely centre of origin and place of early domestication. New research using molecular markers has suggested that domestication may have instead occurred in East Africa and currently both theories carry equal weight.|$|E
5|$|Fish species {{diversity}} is roughly divided equally between marine (oceanic) and freshwater ecosystems. Coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific constitute the center <b>of</b> <b>diversity</b> for marine fishes, whereas continental freshwater fishes are most diverse in large river basins of tropical rainforests, especially the Amazon, Congo, and Mekong basins. More than 5,600 fish species inhabit Neotropical freshwaters alone, such that Neotropical fishes represent about 10% of all vertebrate {{species on the}} Earth. Exceptionally rich sites in the Amazon basin, such as Cantão State Park, can contain more freshwater fish species than occur in all of Europe.|$|E

5|$|Genetic {{analysis}} of pigeye sharks across northern Australia {{suggest that the}} evolutionary history of this species was affected by coastline changes during the Pleistocene epoch (2.6 million to 12,000 years ago). The patterns <b>of</b> <b>diversity</b> found in its mitochondrial DNA {{are consistent with the}} repeated splitting and merging of its populations as geographical barriers were alternately formed and inundated. The most recent of these barriers was a land bridge across the Torres Strait that reopened only some 6,000 years ago; as a result, significant genetic separation exists between the sharks found off Western Australia and the Northern Territory and those found off Queensland.|$|E
5|$|Many American {{cities and}} towns have vibrant music scenes which, in turn, support a number of {{regional}} musical styles. Along with musical centers such as Philadelphia, Seattle, Portland, New York City, San Francisco, New Orleans, Detroit, Minneapolis, Chicago, Miami, Atlanta, Nashville, Austin, and Los Angeles, many smaller cities such as Asbury Park, New Jersey have produced distinctive styles of music. The Cajun and Creole traditions in Louisiana music, the folk and popular styles of Hawaiian music, and the bluegrass and old time music of the Southeastern states are a few examples <b>of</b> <b>diversity</b> in American music. Modern day music is heavily influenced by previous and present African-American music genres.|$|E
5|$|Microbiology {{was largely}} ignored by early {{evolutionary}} theory. This {{was due to}} the paucity of morphological traits and the lack of a species concept in microbiology, particularly amongst prokaryotes. Now, evolutionary researchers are taking advantage of their improved understanding of microbial physiology and ecology, produced by the comparative ease of microbial genomics, to explore the taxonomy and evolution of these organisms. These studies are revealing unanticipated levels <b>of</b> <b>diversity</b> amongst microbes.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{diversity}} within A. cepa occurs within this group, the most economically important Allium crop. Plants within this group form large single bulbs, and are grown from seed or seed-grown sets. The majority of cultivars grown for dry bulbs, salad onions, and pickling onions belong to this group. The range <b>of</b> <b>diversity</b> found among these cultivars includes variation in photoperiod (length of day that triggers bulbing), storage life, flavour, and skin colour. Common onions range from the pungent varieties used for dried soups and onion powder to the mild and hearty sweet onions, such as the Vidalia from Georgia, USA, or Walla Walla from Washington that can be sliced and eaten raw on a sandwich.|$|E

5|$|The bee-eaters have an Old World distribution, {{occurring}} from Europe to Australia. The centre <b>of</b> <b>diversity</b> of {{the family}} is Africa, although a number of species also occur in Asia.

Nyctyornis is restricted to Asia, ranging from India and southern China to the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Borneo. The genus Meropogon has a single species restricted to Sulawesi in Indonesia.|$|E
