50|$|The granite ore bins of the Tweefontein Mine has {{outstanding}} {{examples of}} Cornish stone masonry. The New Prospect Mine houses another granite <b>ore</b> <b>bin</b> in excellent condition.|$|E
50|$|Within {{the rubble}} mound {{there are still}} several posts in situ that {{probably}} relate to the railway bin <b>ore</b> <b>bin</b> site. Between there and the buffers are traces of railway sleepers and dog spikes. The latter are found at intervals along the route outlined above. Currently it is a vehicle track that leads towards the fountain. Its actual route is less identifiable as one leaves the mine site.|$|E
5000|$|Bryntail lead mine is a disused lead mine near Llanidloes in Powys, Wales. [...] It is in {{the care}} of Cadw. There were three main shafts, Murray's, Gundry's and Western shaft. The {{majority}} of the scheduled buildings on the site are associated with Gundry's shaft, including a [...] barytes mill, two crushing houses, <b>ore</b> <b>bins,</b> roasting ovens and water tanks. On the eastern dressing floor are jigger box placements, three buddles, two more <b>ore</b> <b>bins</b> and washing and picking floors. Other mine buildings include the manager's office, smithy, store buildings and a circular magazine.|$|R
50|$|The focal {{building}} is the mill, now an electric powered plant based around a rod mill {{which continues to}} treat parcels of local ore. Surviving structures associated with the mill include timber <b>ore</b> <b>bins</b> (no longer in use), a primary crusher, early ball mill and blast furnace foundations, boiler house and chimney foundations, a workshop and a carpenters shop.|$|R
50|$|The {{complex of}} mill {{buildings}} and machinery has potential to provide further {{information about the}} development of tin concentrating technology and mining and metallurgical engineering in Queensland. Although the stamps and boilers do not remain, some of the <b>ore</b> <b>bins</b> timberwork and tramway formation date from 1884. Remnants of the blast furnace flue, brick chimney base, smelter retaining wall and assay office remain.|$|R
50|$|The Copper Mines {{are located}} about 140m {{east of the}} furnace site, and consist an adit near the creek, {{and a series of}} 3 shafts along the line of the reef running roughly s-w to n-e over the crest of the ridge, and mullock {{associated}} with the shafts. The main shaft is a three-compartment shaft. There is a collapsed <b>ore</b> <b>bin</b> and shute, and some concrete machinery pads, but no other substantial above- ground remains.|$|E
50|$|Some {{segments}} of the old railbed can still be traced out in some places in the desert, but much has now been covered by housing developments of Yermo. The best place to see traces of the old line are {{at the site of}} the former Waterloo Mine, where a large <b>ore</b> <b>bin</b> had dumped silver ore into the waiting trains below. The old foundations of the mills at Elephant Mountain near Daggett also can still be seen and explored.|$|E
50|$|The Davis Mill is a {{historic}} stamp mill located off of North Bloomfield Road northeast of Nevada City, California. The mill served the Randolph Mine, a small gold mine run by the Davis family, from 1915 to 1940. It included the standard machinery of an early 20th century stamp mill, which consisted of a stamp battery, a rock crusher, an <b>ore</b> <b>bin,</b> an amalgamation table, concentrators, and a retort room. These parts were enclosed in a multi-story metal structure. The components and layout of the mill are well-preserved, providing {{an example of how}} miners processed ore in a stamp mill.|$|E
50|$|A {{group of}} timber frame, {{corrugated}} iron clad buildings comprising an almost intact crushing and treatment plant. The battery shed contains four <b>ore</b> <b>bins,</b> a rockbreaker, four 5 head stamp batteries including three with timber blankets draining to three wilfley tables, and six berdan pans. The battery shed also houses a forge, workshop and office. Brick flues {{connect with the}} base of a square brick chimney, the boiler having been removed in favour of electric mains power in 1946.|$|R
50|$|The battery shed is {{of heavy}} bush timber {{uprights}} carrying a light sawn timber frame. The building is corrugated iron clad and roofed. The battery contains {{two sets of}} timber <b>ore</b> <b>bins.</b> The primary crusher has been removed. Timber chutes on the lower bins feed into the two mortar boxes of 2 five head stamp batteries. Two Petter crude oil engines provide the power source for the battery. One engine remains in operating condition. Most of the concentrating plant has been removed {{with the exception of}} a wilfley table.|$|R
50|$|The Mount Cuthbert smelter was {{designed}} by W.H. Corbould, {{who was also a}} noted metallurgist and its completion was delayed because of the war. The blast furnaces were eventually fired early in 1917 and the initial operation treated over 25,000 tons of ore which produced 1,804 tons of copper worth £202,350. The Mount Cuthbert Company also invested in a new winding engine and headframe, 200 ton capacity <b>ore</b> <b>bins,</b> extensions to the blacksmith's shop and electricity connected to all the surface buildings. The old equipment was removed and reassembled at the Orphan mine.|$|R
50|$|An {{article in}} The <b>Ore</b> <b>Bin,</b> a {{publication}} of the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries, explains that White Branch begins at Collier Glacier and follows a glacial trough filled with porous lava. For much of the year, a long stretch of White Branch is dry on the surface. Some of the water percolating through the lava emerges at the spring complex at the head of Lost Creek. Other water in White Branch enters the main stem as a surface tributary. The total length of the Lost Creek - White Branch system is about 20 mi, of which Lost Creek forms about 3 mi.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} ore bins {{can be seen}} on or near the formation, with {{markings}} [...] "Arthur Berlin" [...] at [...] Near the <b>ore</b> <b>bin</b> site, the tramway formation turns sharply into the west bank of Bock's Creek, a tributary of Eureka Creek, travels upstream along this creek and then comes back into Eureka Creek {{on the east side of}} Bock's Creek. Eureka Creek Gorge is between Bock's Creek and Stannary Hills.Two old mango trees, about 25 metres away from the formation, mark the tramway station site at Stannary Hills ( [...] and [...] ). Some glass and metal fragments are evident here, and there are some remains of the Stannary Hills station building, most notably remnants of the loco service pit.|$|E
5000|$|An intact steel {{headframe}} of asymmetrical {{design is}} located over the Urquhart shaft (...) [...] The headframe, occupying a hilltop position, {{is a community}} landmark and a symbol of Mount Isa Mines Limited and the City of Mount Isa. Headframe steelwork is attached to concrete foundations. The Urquhart headframe steelwork bears {{the name of the}} manufacturer, F Rodingham Iron & Steel Co Ltd., England. The concrete mounts of the original development headframe winding plant survive beneath the main structure. As the former main ore haulage shaft, the headframe is equipped with a large steel <b>ore</b> <b>bin,</b> which emptied directly into a primary crusher. The jaw crusher plant has been removed but the concrete structure of the crusher remains. From here the ore was conveyed to the three No.1 Concentrator mills.|$|E
50|$|South-west of Old Grit {{there are}} {{dressing}} floors and the {{winding engine house}} of New Engine (or East Grit) Shaft. This led to workings on Engine Vein, which intersects Rider Vein at Rider Shaft, but the shaft is completely filled. The engine house {{is similar to the}} one at Ladywell in that the rear wall contains a slot, presumably for a flywheel to drive winding or dressing machinery. Near this are the remains of <b>ore</b> <b>bins.</b> The track from here can be followed back to the A488, near which it crosses over Dingle or Squilver Vein.|$|R
50|$|The battery {{contains}} three components, {{the battery}} shed, an associated cottage and a water pump. The battery shed is constructed on a bush timber frame with heavy bush timber uprights. The shed is clad in corrugated iron. Components of the crushing plant include timbered ore chutes to two primary crusher pits (one jaw crusher remains in situ), connected by two external ore bucket elevators to the <b>ore</b> <b>bins,</b> self-feeding 3 five-head stamp batteries. The two bucket elevators have been removed; however, their vertical housings form a distinctive external feature. The battery launders are intact {{but there are}} no copper amalgam plates. Only one of three slimes tables remain. A gas engine which formed the main power plant has recently been removed. Two berdan pans and a grinding pan remain in situ. A lean-to section alongside the battery building contains a smithy and a small workshop.|$|R
50|$|In 1907 the Huntingdon-Heberlein {{process plant}} was erected {{at a cost}} of £60,000. Extensive {{excavations}} were done and rails laid to <b>ore</b> <b>bins</b> on the hill opposite the main smelters. The process flow involved - rock breaker, converter kettles for 12 hours desulphurising process, then to the lead furnaces. A new electric plant was also installed.A new lead furnace was blown in on 21 January 1908. However in 1908 there was hardly a mine operating outside of the company mines as an outcome of wage increases with the emergence of unions and declining copper prices. The new copper furnace was blown in on 20 February 1908 and the converter plant was operating effectively by early March that year. Much better lead recoveries were noticeable after the second converter was introduced into the line, and ores had to be preliminarily roasted as well. At a cost of £70,000 the Chillagoe Railway and Mines Company Pty Limited could treat sulphide ores from its Mungana mines as well as public ore. They could also treat the Penzance (Redcap), Boomerang (Calcifer) and Calcifer slag dump material, along with self-fluxing mixture with Ruddygore ore. To achieve this the company had to extend its tramline from the Chillagoe railway at Harper Siding to the Boomerang and Calcifer slag dump.|$|R
50|$|By 1887 {{production}} of silver ore at the mines had increased sufficiently for the Waterloo Mills at Daggett to upgraded their operations to a 60-stamp mill, powered by electricity and {{water from the}} Mojave River. It was decided that a railroad had to be built {{to keep up with}} the increase in demand for ore. The Calico Railroad was built for 11 miles long starting at the Waterloo Mine, about 2 to 3 miles to the west of Calico. From there, the line went straight down for about 11 miles before looping around Elephant Mountain at a steady rising grade before finally reaching the Waterloo Mill on the side of the mountain facing towards Daggett. A spur was later added to the Silver King Mine in Calico in 1889. The railroad was built up Wall Street Canyon, where at the end was a huge <b>ore</b> <b>bin</b> which was fed ore from the mine high above the town by either animal-drawn ore wagons or mine carts.|$|E
5000|$|The town {{rebuilt the}} {{business}} district {{and opened a}} school enrolling 44 students in mid-1909. Several mines with steady payrolls sustained Pioneer {{through the end of}} the year, but litigation slowed work at the Mayflower and other nearby mines, and the town's growth ceased. Fall enrollment at the school dropped to 24, and residents held a [...] "Hard Times Dance" [...] at the Holland Hotel at the beginning of 1910. Disputes about mine ownership led to further litigation, and the failure of the First National Bank of Rhyolite hampered investments in Pioneer. Stores began to close, and in August 1910, the Holland Hotel was sold to pay delinquent taxes. A shrinking population lived in or near Pioneer for many years, and the post office stayed open through early 1931. Mining, continuing in the area through the 1930s, was suspended in 1941, and did not resume on a large scale after World War II. As of 2004, little remained of Pioneer aside from [...] "quite a bit of debris, levelled building sites, a few boards, and perhaps some foundations" [...] and, nearby, remnants of the Mayflower headframe and <b>ore</b> <b>bin.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Coolgarra Battery site {{comprises}} {{a series}} of benches extending down the northwest slope of the valley. A tall, redbrick chimney with a brick flue is the main feature of the site. This {{is one of only}} two brick chimneys surviving in the Herberton area (the other one being the Rocky Bluff Battery 15 km north-west of Herberton). The flue runs from the chimney to the boiler house site below the stamp battery. An old road curves to the northeast above the mullock heap. An earth ramp supported by bush timber posts has been built below the mullock heap. Below the ramp is a bush timber <b>ore</b> <b>bin</b> frame. Below this a stone retaining wall supports the bench where the stamp battery was located. There are concrete engine mounts and stamper foundations on the stamp battery. Another extensive stone retaining wall, which originally extended for over 110 metres, supports the main bench where the boiler house was located - 70 metres of this wall is still extant. Below this retaining wall several more earth benches support the concentration plant site and other infrastructure. The body of a return-tube boiler lies {{on the banks of the}} creek below the battery, this is not in situ. There is a considerable amount of iron debris lying around on the slope below the boiler house site, this includes iron tanks and wheels. An iron chute runs down the eastern side of the site, below an ore dump.|$|E
50|$|A {{new company}} {{was formed in}} 1912 and the mine reopened after many years. A Victorian mine manager, David Morgan, was {{appointed}} as the new Tyrconnel mine manager. By early 1913 they had the winding gear and <b>ore</b> <b>bins</b> erected. The owners bought the Great Dyke Company's ten head battery at Caledonia Creek near Thornborough. T. Harley, engineer-in-charge, had the contract for £80 to transport the battery to its new position. Their first twelve weeks of crushings from the mine were impressive yielding 1,041 ounces of gold from 945 tons of stone (sent out to another battery for crushing). They installed a compressor in July 1913 and rock drills in September. In October they struck a reef almost 2.4 m wide which offered two to three ounce gold quartz. The mine shaft was then put in order in November for skips. By then the battery was almost ready and the headframe was being put in position. They also had a suction gas engine sitting at Dimbulah awaiting transport to the Hodgkinson. The battery started crushing in February 1914 but broke down in May because the engine bed plate broke. The company was doing very well through Morgan's careful management and William Keating's confidence. They were obtaining one ounce stone continually in 1914 and the battery kept going {{as long as there}} was water.|$|R
40|$|Air {{flow and}} dust {{dispersion}} in an existing underground mine crushing plant was modeled using (Computational Fluid Dynamics) CFD. In the conventional system, investigated {{in the present}} paper, the outgoing dust laden air was collected through an exit in {{the ceiling of the}} chamber (tipple) housing the <b>ore</b> collection <b>bin.</b> The dust collection performance of the system is summarised. The detail results are presented in the form of velocity vectors and dust concentration iso-surface contours. The time dependent dust concentration iso-surfaces are also presented. Dispersion of dust was found to produce cloud engulfing most of the tipple volume...|$|R
5000|$|Work {{carried out}} in 1916-17 {{included}} the construction of flues for saving arsenic, the electric lighting of the mines and mill, {{the construction of a}} new concrete dam, a new elevated double rope line form the new tin shaft to the mill, new self feeders at the mill, and the redressing works was to be remodelled and shifted from its present location at the mill to the calciner. The battery consisted of the 10 head stamper, 4 classifiers, 5 Wilfley tables, 2 Berdan pans and several buddles. The single reverberatory furnace was used to calcine the tin concentrates and drive of arsenic and sulphur. In 1917 a Merton calciner was erected and flues for arsenic recovery constructed. It is likely that these replaced the old reverberatory furnace and calciner. Arsenic became and important product of the mines, the demand escalating during the prickly pear infestation. New shafts were sunk at both the tin and copper mines. The lack of water reduced output in 1918, only 23 tons of tin and 12.5 tons of copper concentrates being produced, but the new shafts were continued, the three compartment copper shaft having poppet legs and <b>ore</b> <b>bins</b> erected, and a cableway built to the battery bins. A new reverberatory furnace was built and a water pipeline laid to the Severn River. The Merton Furnace was described in 1918 as being for the roasting of arsenic concentrates, with the arsenic being condensed in 200 ft of [...] "mud flues", while the new reverberatory furnace was for copper smelting.|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} pictorial {{article on}} the golden years of eastern Oregon, by Miles F. Potter and Harold McCall, is an abstract from their manuscript of a forthcoming book they are calling "Golden Pebbles. " Potter is a long-time resident of eastern Oregon and an amateur historian {{of some of the}} early gold camps in Grant and Baker Counties. McCall is a photographer in Oregon City with a keen interest in the history of gold mining. The two authors have been working together {{for a number of years}} assembling photographs and data from many sources for their book. Their article and the accompanying pictures in this issue of The <b>ORE</b> <b>BIN</b> remind us of a commonly forgotten fact: that the discovery of gold in eastern Oregon had a tremendous impact on the economy and development of the entire region which is still felt a full century later. Gold mining was also the mainstay of the early economy of southwestern Oregon and played an equally significant role in the development of that region (see: "Lest We Forget," by F. W. Libbey, June 1963 <b>ORE</b> <b>BIN).</b> Ed...|$|E
50|$|Copper {{was found}} in the area in 1874 by J.E. Wright of Foxlow station. The Molonglo goldfield was {{declared}} in 1882 and mining for gold and silver commenced at two mines, Koh-i-noor and Commodore, which were operated by two mining companies. Two blast furnaces were built in 1885. The two companies merged in 1894 and formed the Lake George United Mining and Smelting Company. Up to that time the mines had produced mainly copper with some silver and a small amount of gold. Processing was made harder {{because of the presence of}} zinc. To convey <b>ore</b> to the <b>bins</b> at the smelter, the company built a 2 ft (610mm) tramway in 1897. Trains of small 4-wheel dump cars were hauled by a Krauss steam locomotive. The tramway appears to have closed about 1902. In the early twentieth century the mine produced gold and copper. Mining activity ceased in 1920.|$|R
5000|$|During the 50s {{this method}} was {{widespread}} throughout the mine. According to the inclination of the veins, used: parallel fronts (for sub-horizontal veins) or irregular fronts, also called [...] "modas e bordados” (fashions and embroideries) (for veins with a slope between 7º and 12º). Wooden ore cars circulated within the stope (manual filling) that transported the <b>ore</b> to the <b>bins</b> where it dropped by gravity to the Lower Scrolling Level. Mechanical drilling {{was done with}} compressed air jacklegs and the start off was done, as today by explosives. When filling the ore cars the waste was chosen remaining as a wall that accompanied the advancement of the excavation constituting the structure responsible {{for the support of}} the cavity. This method had several drawbacks such as the requirement of a lot of labour and the loss of the finer fraction of the ore as it was violently thrown against the stone walls. The method was improved in order to find solutions for the loss of this finer fraction and consequently more mineralized.|$|R
40|$|The {{price of}} gold has risen from $ 60. 35 per ounce in mid-November, 1972, to $ 91. 25 per ounce in mid-April, 1973. The present high price has caused {{considerable}} speculation as to the underlying reasons for the sudden increase and what effect it may have on the international monetary situation. This precious metal has been eagerly collected and mined for more than 6, 000 years because of its desirable physical qualities and its relative scarcity. Although some economists {{refer to it as}} a "barbaric metal," the expanding use of gold in the electronics industry attests {{to the fact that it}} is an important contributor to our modern technological society. Because of the present great interest in gold, this issue of The <b>ORE</b> <b>BIN</b> features a wide variety of information on gold, with contributions by mining engineers, economists, and Department staff...|$|E
40|$|The platinum-group metals {{have been}} the subject of {{considerable}} discussion in the news media over the past few months, particularly because of their projected use as catalysts in automobile engines. Metals Week of August 27 shows that platinum commands a price of $ 176. 00 per ounce, as compared to $ 150. 00 per ounce last May. Oregon's platinum production has been tied closely to its gold placer mining activities; therefore, little production has been recorded since 1942 when Executive Order L- 208 closed down practically all of the gold mines in the country. The future potential of platinum production in Oregon is difficult to predict. The present high price of both gold and platinum should certainly act as a stimulus for exploration, particularly if the prices remain at their present level or go even higher. This issue of The <b>ORE</b> <b>BIN</b> discusses the properties of the platinum-group metals and describes areas in the state where platinum is known to occur. We hope this information will encourage new exploration efforts in Oregon...|$|E
40|$|The 50 -mile {{stretch of}} the Oregon coast be!ween Tillamook Bay and the Columbia River {{can be divided into}} three nearly equal {{segments}} according to the kinds of landforms along them. The southern segment extends from Tillamook Bay to Neahkahnie Mountain (map I), the middle from Neahkahnie Mountain to Tillamook Head inclusive (map 2), and the northern from Tillamook Head to the Columbia River (map 3). The discussion of the landforms is presented in the order of these divisions. In preparing this article, an attempt was made to use as few technical terms as possible {{in view of the fact}} that many of The <b>ORE</b> <b>BIN</b> readers may not have had formal education in the earth sciences. It is not possible, however, to avoid all technical terms in a presentation such as this; therefore, a glossary of words most likely to be troublesome is available at the end of the article.

40|$|Like {{the ancient}} critters shown in these pages, Oregon Geology {{falls to the}} inexorable march of time. This will be our final issue in this print-based format. Stay tuned for {{articles}} on Oregon’s fascinating and varied geology in blog and other media outlets. Meanwhile, in this issue enjoy some recent findings from Oregon’s fossil hunters. I {{want to take this}} opportunity to offer recognition and thanks to everyone who has contributed to Oregon Geology throughout its lifespan starting in 1979. The issues contain a treasure trove of factual and historical information about Oregon’s lands, landforms, and geoscientists. Both Oregon Geology and the earlier published <b>Ore</b> <b>Bin</b> are frequently the starting point for me when gathering information for everything from Legislative testimony to classroom presentations. I know I am not the only one, as we still sell hardcopy publications in the Nature of the Northwest Information Center and the online resource gets a fair number of hits. That tells me that although we cannot continue with Oregon Geology in its current format we should continue to offer a venue to distribute geologic and geoscientific information outside of our more formal publications. Suggestions are welcome—just go to our website to submit or give me a call. DOGAMI continues to evolve and change as well. We are constantly responding to environmental changes such as new statewide policies, calls for smaller government, and different demands for our mission and information. Since the last publication of Oregon Geology five years ago we have closed the Grants Pass Field Office, moved the Nature of the Northwest Information Center, and turned our lidar data collection program into a nationally recognized success story.
