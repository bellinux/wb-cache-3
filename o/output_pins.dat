2500|$|An {{avalanche}} transistor {{operated by a}} common bias network {{is shown in the}} picture on the right: [...] can be zero or positive value, while [...] can be short circuited. In every {{avalanche transistor}} circuit, the output signal is taken from the collector or the emitter: therefore the small-signal differential model of an avalanche transistor working in the avalanche region is always seen from the collector-emitter <b>output</b> <b>pins,</b> and consist of a parallel [...] circuit as shown in the picture on the right, which includes only bias components.|$|E
2500|$|DirectShow divides {{a complex}} {{multimedia}} task (e.g. video playback) into {{a sequence of}} fundamental processing steps known as filters. [...] Each filterwhich represents one stage in the processing of the datahas input and/or <b>output</b> <b>pins</b> {{that may be used}} to connect the filter to other filters. The generic nature of this connection mechanism enables filters to be connected in various ways so as to implement different complex functions. To implement a specific complex task, a developer must first build a filter graph by creating instances of the required filters, and then connecting the filters together.|$|E
5000|$|CLAMP {{a variant}} of BYPASS which drives the <b>output</b> <b>pins</b> using the PRELOADed values ...|$|E
5000|$|When {{an object}} executes, {{it uses the}} input pin's value to perform an operation. When it finishes, the result {{is placed on the}} <b>output</b> <b>pin.</b> The <b>output</b> <b>pin</b> value placed is then {{propagated}} to any input pins that are connected to it.|$|R
50|$|Each logic block <b>output</b> <b>pin</b> {{can connect}} {{to any of}} the wiring {{segments}} in the channels adjacent to it.|$|R
50|$|Programmable logic devices, such as {{programmable}} array {{logic and}} complex programmable logic devices, typically have a macrocell on every <b>output</b> <b>pin.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The MIDIO128 {{interface}} is used {{to drive}} up to 128 digital <b>output</b> <b>pins</b> and to react on up to 128 digital input pins via MIDI ...|$|E
50|$|The pins on {{the left}} side of an object are called input pins, whereas the pins on the right are <b>output</b> <b>pins.</b> Two objects, A and B, are {{connected}} if the output pin of object A is connected to object B’s input pin. Several connection lines can emanate from a single output pin, but at most one connection line can be attached to an input pin. All data input pins and execute pins must be connected, whereas control pins and <b>output</b> <b>pins</b> can be left unconnected.|$|E
50|$|Uni-directional - All input pins are {{dedicated}} to one voltage domain, all <b>output</b> <b>pins</b> {{are dedicated}} to the other. Bi-directional with Dedicated Ports - Each voltage domain has both input and <b>output</b> <b>pins,</b> but the data direction of a pin does not change. Bi-directional with External direction indicator - When an external signal is changed, inputs become outputs and vice versa. Bi-directional, auto-sensing - A pair of I/O spanning voltage domains can act as either inputs or outputs depending on external stimulus {{without the need for}} a dedicated direction control pin.|$|E
50|$|In {{bistable}} mode, the 555 timer {{acts as a}} basic flip-flop. The {{trigger and}} reset inputs (pins 2 and 4 respectively on a 555) are held high via pull-up resistors while the threshold input (pin 6) is simply floating. Thus configured, pulling the trigger momentarily to ground acts as a 'set' and transitions the <b>output</b> <b>pin</b> (pin 3) to VCC (high state). Pulling the reset input to ground acts as a 'reset' and transitions the <b>output</b> <b>pin</b> to ground (low state). No timing capacitors are required in a bistable configuration. Pin 7 (discharge) is left unconnected, or {{may be used as}} an open-collector output.|$|R
5000|$|In this context, {{the blocks}} are logic gates such as NAND, OR, AND, etc. Although in reality these gates will be {{composed}} of transistors, a semi-custom engineer will only {{be aware of the}} delay information from input <b>pin</b> to <b>output</b> <b>pin,</b> called a timing arc. The 2D table represents information about the variability of the gate's delay with respect to the two independent variables, usually the rate of change of the signal at the input and the load at the <b>output</b> <b>pin.</b> These two variable are called slew and load in design parlance.|$|R
5000|$|... setup (...) : This {{function}} is called once when a sketch starts after power-up or reset. It {{is used to}} initialize variables, input and <b>output</b> <b>pin</b> modes, and other libraries needed in the sketch.|$|R
50|$|The AY-3-8610 {{featured}} {{a completely different}} pinout. It, too, required an external crystal oscillator. It still has separate video <b>output</b> <b>pins,</b> and the dedicated sync pin is now gone.|$|E
5000|$|When data {{is present}} on execute pins, it will force the object to operate and place results on its <b>output</b> <b>pins,</b> {{regardless}} of whether the data inputs have values.|$|E
50|$|A {{sensor board}} {{included}} a three-axis accelerometer (with 2G and 6G range settings), temperature sensor, light sensor, 8 tri-color LEDs, analog and digital inputs, two momentary switches, and 4 high current <b>output</b> <b>pins.</b>|$|E
50|$|Each input is {{accessible}} {{from one side}} of the logic block, while the <b>output</b> <b>pin</b> can connect to routing wires in both the channel to the right and the channel below the logic block.|$|R
5000|$|Available on the MSP430FR4xxx and MSP430FR2xxx series chips, {{this feature}} is {{configured}} via the SYSCFG register set. This peripheral ties into other peripherals (Timers, eUSCI_A) to generate an IR modulated signal on an <b>output</b> <b>pin.</b> (page 43) ...|$|R
50|$|The KR580VM80A was {{manufactured}} with an n-MOS process. The pins were electrically {{compatible with}} TTL logic levels. The load capacity of each <b>output</b> <b>pin</b> was sufficient for one TTL input. The output capacitance of each control and data pins was ≤ 100pF each.|$|R
50|$|To {{minimize}} chip {{count in}} control applications it has dedicated serial input and <b>output</b> <b>pins</b> to allow implementation of serial communications in software {{without the need}} for a UART (this feature was removed in the later SC/MP III).|$|E
5000|$|An {{extension}} {{of this technique}} is Charlieplexing where the ability of some microcontrollers to tri-state their <b>output</b> <b>pins</b> means larger numbers of LEDs can be driven, without using latches. For N pins, {{it is possible to}} drive n2-n LEDs ...|$|E
50|$|Manufacturers {{and users}} of {{integrated}} circuits must take precautions to avoid ESD. ESD prevention {{can be part}} of the device itself and include special design techniques for device input and <b>output</b> <b>pins.</b> External protection components can also be used with circuit layout.|$|E
5000|$|A {{resistive}} {{voltage divider}} between the output and ground configures the op amp as a non-inverting amplifier {{so that the}} voltage of the <b>output</b> <b>pin</b> is continuously adjusted to be a fixed amount, the reference voltage, above that of the adjustment pin. Ideally, this makes the output voltage: ...|$|R
25|$|Output {{sink current}}: The output sink current is the maximum current allowed {{to sink into}} the output stage. Some {{manufacturers}} show the output voltage vs. the output sink current plot, which gives {{an idea of the}} output voltage when it is sinking current from another source into the <b>output</b> <b>pin.</b>|$|R

50|$|Node Based Editor - Programs are edited in {{grasshopper}} using a node-based interface. Components are {{dragged out}} of palettes, and placed onto the canvas. Each component node represents a certain function, with input and <b>output</b> <b>pins.</b> Pins can be interconnected to form programs.|$|E
50|$|The {{cycloidal}} disc has {{holes that}} are {{slightly larger than}} the output roller pins that go inside them. The <b>output</b> <b>pins</b> will move around in the holes to achieve steady rotation of the output shaft from the wobbling movement of the cycloidal disc.|$|E
5000|$|An error pin {{is used to}} trap errors when {{an object}} execute. If it is present, no error dialog will be shown. When an error occurs, the error pin propagates instead of data <b>output</b> <b>pins,</b> {{followed}} by the sequence output pin (if connected).|$|E
50|$|In {{packages}} with a heat-dissipating mounting tab, such as TO-220, the tab {{is connected}} internally to the <b>output</b> <b>pin</b> which {{may make it}} necessary to electrically isolate the tab or the heat sink {{from other parts of}} the application circuit. Failure to do this may cause the circuit to short.|$|R
50|$|Output {{sink current}}: The output sink current is the maximum current allowed {{to sink into}} the output stage. Some {{manufacturers}} show the output voltage vs. the output sink current plot, which gives {{an idea of the}} output voltage when it is sinking current from another source into the <b>output</b> <b>pin.</b>|$|R
50|$|SMBus, {{defined by}} Intel in 1995, is {{a subset of}} I²C, {{defining}} a stricter usage. One purpose of SMBus is to promote robustness and interoperability. Accordingly, modern I²C systems incorporate some policies and rules from SMBus, sometimes supporting both I²C and SMBus, requiring only minimal reconfiguration either by commanding or <b>output</b> <b>pin</b> use.|$|R
50|$|Now, {{consider}} {{that each of}} the n <b>output</b> <b>pins</b> acts, independently, as a logic device that is specially selected to sample just one of the possible 22m such functions. At any given time, only one of the 2m possible input values can be present on the ROM, but over time, as the input values span their full possible domain, each output pin will map out its particular function of the 2m possible input values, from among the 22m possible such functions. Note that the structure of the ROM allows just n of the 22m possible such Boolean functions to be produced at the <b>output</b> <b>pins.</b> The ROM therefore becomes equivalent to n separate logic circuits, each of which generates a chosen function of the m inputs.|$|E
50|$|An {{action may}} receive inputs {{in the form}} of control flows and object flows (the latter via input pins) and passes the results of its {{processing}} or transformations to one or more outgoing control flows or object flows (the latter via <b>output</b> <b>pins)</b> and onto downstream nodes.|$|E
50|$|Only 75 µs is {{required}} to read 128 digital input pins and to write to 128 <b>output</b> <b>pins.</b> 16 rotary encoders are handled within 100 µs. Analog inputs are scanned in the background every 200 µs; changes larger than a definable minimum range trigger a user hook.|$|E
50|$|The astable configuration, {{with two}} resistors, cannot produce a 50% duty cycle. To produce a 50% duty cycle, {{eliminate}} R1, disconnect pin 7 and connect the supply end of R2 to <b>pin</b> 3, the <b>output</b> <b>pin.</b> This circuit {{is similar to}} using an inverter gate as an oscillator, but with fewer components than the astable configuration, and a much higher power output than a TTL or CMOS gate. The duty cycle for either the 555 or inverter-gate timer will not be precisely 50% and will change based off any load that the output is also driving while high (longer duty cycles for greater loads) {{due to the fact}} the timing network is supplied from the devices <b>output</b> <b>pin,</b> which has different internal resistances depending on whether it is in the high or low state (high side drivers tend to be more resistive).|$|R
5000|$|SLW ($C2) - Releases the {{connection}} between the oscillator <b>output</b> and <b>pin</b> Xoutf.|$|R
50|$|Because {{the pins}} of the {{joystick}} were wired {{directly to the}} input/output controllers on the motherboard, {{it was possible to}} program them to output to the port, rather than input. This capability was used in the Atari XEP80 80-column card, which used pin 1 as an <b>output</b> <b>pin,</b> and pin 2 as an input. A device driver used these pins to implement a bidirectional serial port, which worked in joystick port 1 or 2. Similar drivers were used by other devices, like modems, which avoided the need to use the more expensive Atari SIO system.|$|R
