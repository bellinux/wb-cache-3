Therefore, less processing operations per packet are required in an OBS network core <b>optical</b> <b>router</b> compared to an OPS network. Consequently, the energy consumption and potentially the carbon footprint of a core <b>optical</b> <b>router</b> in an OPS network {{is likely to be}} larger than that of an OBS network router for the same amount of data.|$|E

50|$|A basic {{implementation}} of the OIS concept sees an <b>optical</b> <b>router</b> that monitors IP traffic and if a flow appears with specific characteristics the router establishes an optical cut-through path between its upstream and downstream neighbours, requesting the upstream node to place all the packets belonging to the flow into the new path. The newly generated trail bypasses the IP layer of the router, as the packets transparently flow from the upstream to the downstream neighbour. Following a similar procedure the path can then be extended to more than three nodes, but this decision is always autonomously taken by each router and depends on the traffic encountered and on the resources locally available.Since an optical link however can carry several gigabits of data per second, {{it may be difficult}} to find a flow that alone can exploit the bandwidth offered by an optical trail.For this reason, aggregating more IP flows into the same dedicated path is essential for the performance of an OIS network.The aggregation introduces a trade-off between the number of IP flows that can be aggregated together and the length of the optical trail that accommodates them.In order to achieve good performance only optical flows sharing a significant amount of network hops should be aggregated into the same path.A core node implementing optical IP switching must be endowed with electrical processing and memory resources (as a standard IP router), a variable number of optical transceivers and an optical switching element (usually a MEMS based device).An edge node instead does not need an optical switching device because it could only function as source or destination of the optical flow.|$|E

40|$|Photonic {{devices are}} widely used in optical networks-on-chip (ONoCs) and suffer from {{crosstalk}} noise. The accumulative crosstalk noise in large scale ONoCs diminishes the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), causes severe performance degradation, and constrains the network scalability. For the first time, this paper systematically analyzes and models the worst-case crosstalk noise and SNR in folded-torus-based ONoCs. Formal analytical models for the worst-case crosstalk noise and SNR are presented. The crosstalk noise analysis is hierarchically performed at the basic photonic device level, then at the <b>optical</b> <b>router</b> level, and finally at the network level.

The number of MRRs used in the proposed GWOR is the least among the existing passive router designs for the same network size. In addition, we show that the power loss experienced on GWORs is lower than other comparative designs. Furthermore, to improve the bandwidth and fault tolerance capability of the GWORs, the redundant GWOR (RGWOR) structure is presented.
