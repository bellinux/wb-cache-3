Both of these aspects were subject to serious challenge in the light of events in 1878.|$|E
5|$|Alcibiades first rose to {{prominence}} {{when he began}} advocating aggressive Athenian action after {{the signing of the}} Peace of Nicias. That treaty, an uneasy truce between Sparta and Athens signed midway through the Peloponnesian War, came at the end of seven years of fighting during which neither side had gained a decisive advantage. Historians Arnold W. Gomme and Raphael Sealey believe, and Thucydides reports, that Alcibiades was offended that the Spartans had negotiated that treaty through Nicias and Laches, overlooking him <b>on</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> youth.|$|E

5|$|Alexios's son John II Komnenos succeeded him in 1118, and was to rule until 1143. <b>On</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{mild and}} just reign, {{he has been}} called the Byzantine Marcus Aurelius. John was unusual for his lack of cruelty—despite his long reign, he never had anyone killed or blinded. He was loved by his subjects, who gave him the name 'John the Good'. He was also an {{energetic}} campaigner, spending much of his life in army camps and personally supervising sieges.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the start}} of the Kurukshetra war, Duryodhana’s {{ministry}} assembles to appoint the generals of the army. Bhishma is appointed the Commander and he starts nominating generals for different battalions. Karnan is insulted <b>on</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> lowly birth and given the command of a low rank infantry. The war begins and in the early days, Bhishma retires and Karnan replaces him. The following day, Karnan goes to war accompanied by his son Vrishasena who fights bravely, but is killed by Arjuna afterwards.|$|E
5|$|<b>On</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{increasingly}} failing health, Gilkeson {{spent the}} summer of 1921 in Mountain Lake Park, Maryland, to recuperate. About a week before his death, Gilkeson fell {{down a flight of}} porch steps at his vacation residence, fracturing a number of bones. He died on September 29, 1921, in Mountain Lake Park, and his funeral was held on the anniversary of his son's death on October 2, 1921. Gilkeson is interred with his wife Mary Katherine and son Henry, Jr., at Indian Mound Cemetery in Romney, West Virginia.|$|E

5|$|Although he {{appeared}} to be an unlikely candidate <b>on</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> age and weak health, Nerva was considered a safe choice precisely because he was old and childless. Furthermore, he had close connections with the Flavian dynasty and commanded the respect of a substantial part of the Senate. Nerva had seen the anarchy which had resulted from the death of Nero; he knew that to hesitate even for a few hours could lead to violent civil conflict. Rather than decline the invitation and risk revolts, he accepted. The decision may have been hasty so as to avoid civil war, but neither the Senate nor Nerva appears to {{have been involved in the}} conspiracy against Domitian.|$|E
5|$|Julian Glover was a {{well-established}} character actor {{who had previously}} appeared in Doctor Who as Richard the Lionheart in The Crusade (1965). Glover was reluctant to don the Jagaroth mask created for scenes where Scarlioni had shed his human disguise as he felt the mask would impede his performance. As a result, he is doubled by Richard Sheekey {{in many of these}} scenes. Tom Chadbon was cast as Duggan <b>on</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> resemblance to the Franco-Belgian comics hero Tintin. Peter Halliday had previously appeared in several Doctor Who serials including The Invasion and Doctor Who and the Silurians.|$|E
5|$|<b>On</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{residency}} in England, Denny Fairfax appointed Martin and Jones as {{managers of the}} proprietary. Martin and Jones placed advertisements in newspapers petitioning proprietary tenants to bring their claims against the Lord Fairfax estate forward and prove them. The descendants of William Fairfax continued to assert back claims against the estates of Lord Fairfax, which had been rendered by William Fairfax prior to 1757. In order to absolve himself of these back claims, Denny Fairfax renounced his appointments of Martin and Jones, and instead appointed Bryan Fairfax, 8th Lord Fairfax of Cameron as the sole steward of the proprietary in an official transposition in London on September 21, 1784.|$|E

5|$|Opposition {{seems to}} have {{continued}} even after the coronation. According to William of Malmesbury, an otherwise unknown nobleman called Alfred plotted to blind Æthelstan <b>on</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> supposed illegitimacy, although it is unknown whether he aimed to make himself king or was {{acting on behalf of}} Edwin, Ælfweard's younger brother. Blinding would have been a sufficient disability to render Æthelstan ineligible for kingship without incurring the odium attached to murder. Tensions between Æthelstan and Winchester seem to have continued for some years. The Bishop of Winchester, Frithestan, did not attend the coronation or witness any of Æthelstan's known charters until 928. After that he witnessed fairly regularly until his resignation in 931, but was listed in a lower position than entitled by his seniority.|$|E
5|$|Plans for a Simone biographical film were {{released}} {{at the end}} of 2005, to be based on Simone's autobiography I Put a Spell on You (1992) and to focus on her relationship in later life with her assistant, Clifton Henderson, who died in 2006; Simone's daughter, Simone Kelly, has since refuted the existence of a romantic relationship between Simone and Henderson <b>on</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> homosexuality. Cynthia Mort, screenwriter of Will & Grace and Roseanne, has written the screenplay and directed the film, Nina, which stars Zoe Saldana in the title role. In May 2014, the film was shown to potential distributors at the Cannes Film Festival, but has, , not been seen by reviewers.|$|E
5|$|Ponsford met Vera Neill at {{his local}} Methodist church; the pair married in 1924 {{and settled in}} the Melbourne suburb of Caulfield South. They had two sons, Bill Jr. and Geoff. Ponsford became a Freemason in 1922 and {{continued}} in the movement until 1985, retiring with the rank of Master Mason. During the Second World War, Ponsford attempted to volunteer with the Royal Australian Air Force, but was rejected <b>on</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> colour blindness. In 1978, {{four years after the}} death of his wife, Ponsford moved in with his son, Geoff, at Woodend in rural Victoria, and was an active lawn bowler. An infection after an operation in 1988 saw Ponsford admitted to a nursing home in nearby Kyneton. He died there on 6 April 1991; at the time he was Australia's oldest living Test cricketer.|$|E

5|$|Settling in California, Đujić {{played an}} {{important}} role in Serbian émigré circles and founded the Ravna Gora Movement of Serbian Chetniks alongside other exiled Chetnik fighters. He later retired to San Marcos, where he wrote poems and jokes that were published in both the United States and Serbia. He was instrumental in perpetuating Chetnik ideas in the Yugoslav Wars and controversially appointed Vojislav Šešelj as a Chetnik vojvoda in 1989. In 1998, Đujić said that he regretted awarding the title to Šešelj <b>on</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> involvement with Slobodan Milošević. On 21 May 1998, Biljana Plavšić, President of the Republika Srpska at the time, awarded him the Order of the Star of Karađorđe (First Class).

5|$|Stephen Owen Davies (before 1889 – 25 February 1972), {{generally}} {{known as}} S. O.

5|$|Unmarried princess Kunti is {{blessed by}} the Sun god {{with a baby}} boy, which she {{abandons}} in the Ganges to avoid embarrassment. The boy is rescued and adopted by charioteer Athirathan and is named Karnan. Years later, the now-grown up Karnan realises that Athirathan is only his adoptive father and feels heartbroken. He {{does not want to}} become a charioteer like Athirathan, and instead chooses to become a warrior. He masters archery and challenges the Pandava prince Arjuna in a contest. Karnan is insulted <b>on</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> lowly birth, but the Kaurava prince and cousin of the Pandavas, Duryodhana, saves his pride, and gives him the kingdom of Anga. Karnan thus becomes the close friend of Duryodhana and his wife Bhanumati.|$|E

5|$|After Ecgric {{had been}} ruling alone for two years, East Anglia was {{attacked}} by a Mercian army, led by Penda. The date of the invasion is usually given as around 636, although Kirby suggests {{it could have been}} so late as 641. Ecgric was sufficiently forewarned as to be able to gather an army, described by Bede as opimus or splendid. Realising that they would be inferior in battle to the war-hardened Mercians and remembering that Sigeberht was once their most vigorous and distinguished leader, the East Anglians urged him to lead them in battle, hoping that his presence would encourage them not to flee from the Mercians. After he refused, <b>on</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> religious calling, he was borne off against his will to the battlefield. He refused to bear weapons and so was killed. Ecgric was also slain during the battle and many of his countrymen either perished or were put to flight. The location of the site of the battle in which the East Anglians were routed and their king was killed is unknown, but it can be presumed to have been close to the kingdom’s western border with the Middle Angles.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{surrender}} of the Royal Yugoslav Army on 17 April 1941, while stationed at an airfield at Zemun near Belgrade, the Geschwader received orders on 3 May 1941 to turn over all Bf109-Es so they could receive the new Bf 109-F variant. Transition training was completed at Airfield Stolp-Reitz in Pomerania. Following intensive training, the Geschwader was moved to airfields in Eastern Prussia. On 22 June at 03:05, 120 aircraft of the Geschwader crossed into Soviet airspace in support of Operation Barbarossa, {{the invasion of the}} Soviet Union. Philipp, like many other German fighter pilots, enjoyed superiority over his Soviet adversaries in the early phase of Barbarossa, both in terms of the training he had received and the aircraft that he flew. He quickly accumulated further victories and <b>on</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> 31st to 33rd victories achieved on 4 July was mentioned in the Wehrmachtbericht radio report, the first of five such mentions, on 7 July.|$|E
5|$|In 1388 he {{returned}} to Rome, possibly hoping that the accusations against him had been forgotten in the meanwhile. He was arrested, tried and imprisoned, but was released after Urban VI's death in October 1389 and the general amnesty granted by the new pope, Boniface IX. Leaving Rome, Paul went {{to the court of}} Amadeus VII of Savoy. There he presented himself as a distant relative to the Count—a claim likely relying on his tenuous links to the Palaiologoi, who in turn were remotely linked to the House of Savoy via Empress Anna of Savoy, Amadeus VII's great-aunt—and as a victim of papal persecution <b>on</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> support for the Avignon papacy. Paul's claims of kinship were dubious, but Amadeus was moved by the plight of a fellow Avignon supporter, and accepted him as the legitimate Latin Patriarch of Constantinople. He provided Paul with money and an escort of twelve horses and twelve servants, and sent him on to the papal court of Avignon.|$|E
