But this is not the limit of the ring-tailed lemur's reasoning skills.

The zardozi on costumes were also stitched by designers from Surat. A statue of Lord Krishna, to which Jodhabai prayed, was made of gold. In the scenes involving an imprisoned Anarkali, real chains were placed on Madhubala.

5|$|Birdy was {{the first}} feature film to be {{partially}} shot with the Skycam, a computer-controlled, cable-suspended camera system created by Garrett Brown, inventor of the Steadicam. The Skycam had 100-foot high posts with four hanging wires controlled by a computer, and a lightweight Panavision camera with 200 feet of film hung {{at the center of}} the wires. The filmmakers intended to use the Skycam to fully depict Birdy's point of view during a fantasy sequence in which he imagines himself flying. However, they encountered difficulties with the Skycam, which would often malfunction. Although the Skycam proved successful on its first take, Parker insisted that the filmed footage be shot more rapidly. However, the camera system malfunctioned during its second take, after capturing 40 seconds of footage. This resulted in the camera operators shooting the remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sequence</b> with a Steadicam mounted on top of an improvised camera dolly.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{took place}} over a 13 to 14 days period in December 2001. It was not filmed on order of the script; the scenes set around the Osbourne {{residence}} for instance, were all filmed at once, during two to three days, though during the episodes, the scenes took place in separate parts of the episode. Parts of the introduction scenes, where Danny's team break into Osbourne's house, was actually filmed on the Grid set. Parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sequence</b> were originally filmed without sound; the sound would later be added during post production. The footage of the drowned immigrants found at the shore were shot by the second unit headed by producer Simon Crawford Collins on a pebbled courtyard in Kensington to double as a beach.|$|E
5|$|Following the event, a {{field survey}} was {{conducted}} along the fault zone {{with the goal of}} estimating the peak ground acceleration of the shock based on visually evaluating precarious rock formations and other indicators.

5|$|In 1972, Vincent Demoulin {{described}} the species Lycoperdon americanum {{on the basis}} of a specimen found in North Carolina.

In previous analyses that used only the rRNA sequences for phylogenetic comparison, L.echinatum formed a clade with L.mammiforme, L.foetidum, and Bovistella radicata (now known as Lycoperdon radicatum), but separate from L.pyriforme.|$|E

5|$|March 10 and 11 were {{dedicated}} to the scenes in Sang Min's warehouse. The team's assault of the warehouse was filmed by three separate units.

In the scene where McGarrett shoots Sang Min's Mercedes-Benz before it crashes into a shipping container was done with two separate takes, the first of which involved O'Loughlin shooting blanks into a car. The car would swerve away. The second take saw the car crash into the container with O'Loughlin away from the shot as McGarrett was in close proximity to the car. The eighth day of filming was spent in a village of quonset huts where McGarrett and Danny chase Doran. In one part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sequence,</b> McGarrett jumps over the trunk of one car as it was hit from behind by another car.
