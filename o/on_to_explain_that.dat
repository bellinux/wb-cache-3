5|$|Up to this point, Australia's {{performances}} {{had been}} poor, and winter athletes were often derided by the summer-dominated administrators. During one meeting, a cross-country representative {{asked for the}} selection of six athletes, prompting the selection committee chairman to interject. The chairman said that a seventh place would be needed, and went <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> a dog was required to find the athletes after they {{got lost in the}} snow. The majority of his colleagues burst into laughter.|$|E
5|$|Verbal goes <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>that,</b> after Fenster had bailed on the group, Kobayashi {{gave them}} a {{location}} at which to find their compatriot's dead body. They tried to kill Kobayashi, but he strong-armed them into performing the heist by threatening their loved ones. They staked out the ship and killed several Argentinian and Hungarian gangsters, but found no drugs on board. McManus, Hockney and a man locked aboard the ship were killed by an unseen person, who also killed Keaton and set the ship on fire as Verbal looked on.|$|E
25|$|Erna goes <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> {{the album}} was {{recorded}} with instruments such as hand drums, cellos, flutes and piano, making it very different from his signature sound with Godsmack.|$|E
6000|$|When, however, I {{told her}} that my friend Jephson was going to {{collaborate}} with me, she remarked, [...] "Oh," [...] in a doubtful tone; and when I further went <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> her <b>that</b> Selkirk Brown and Derrick MacShaughnassy were also going to assist, she replied, [...] "Oh," [...] in a tone which contained no trace of doubtfulness whatever, and from which {{it was clear that}} her interest in the matter, as a practical scheme, had entirely evaporated.|$|R
5000|$|Charles goes <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> Vance <b>that</b> {{his latest}} case {{revolves}} around a [...] "tall, thin man" [...] (referring to Clyde Wynant), just before clips {{of the film}} are shown.|$|R
50|$|In New York he met {{a trader}} named John Rhoades, a Massachusetts {{resident}} thoroughly familiar with the fur trade on the coasts of Maine and Acadia, who {{told him that the}} Dutch were no longer at war with the English, but that France had yet to come to terms. Rhoades went <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> Aernoutsz <b>that</b> the French colony in Acadia was barely defended and ripe for conquest. Aernoutsz took this suggestion to his a crew and they agreed unanimously. John Rhoades would be the crew's guide.|$|R
25|$|On 23 December 2001, {{during his}} annual {{birthday}} meeting with reporters, the Emperor, {{in response to}} a reporter's question about tensions with Korea, remarked that he felt a kinship with Koreans and went <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>that,</b> in the Shoku Nihongi, the mother of Emperor Kammu (736–806) is related to Muryeong of Korea, King of Baekje, a fact that was considered taboo.|$|E
25|$|The report - {{in which}} the {{frequent}} mention of the police reflected the magazine's concerns as expressed by Stancer - went <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> the race had been banned by the NCU and the RTTC but {{that there had been}} no incidents other than a lorry backing on to the course. Fifteen riders finished and all those involved in the race were expelled from the NCU. Stallard was banned for life for refusing to account for himself to the NCU's management.|$|E
25|$|He goes <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> in Albert Einstein's special {{theory of}} relativity, {{the rule that}} nothing can go faster {{than the speed of}} light, does not apply to galaxies in an {{expanding}} universe. He further explains that while that rule may apply in a preexisting static space, it does not apply in an expanding universe. In an expanding cosmic universe galaxies can travel away from each other at speeds in excess of the speed of light. As a result of this there are galaxies so far away that the light from them have not reached earth yet and therefore we don't even know they exist. Ferris refers to this phenomenon as a boundless steadily increasing and changing universe with a changing density.|$|E
2500|$|The Court went <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain,</b> however, <b>that</b> {{not every}} act done {{with intent to}} produce an {{unlawful}} result constitutes an attempt. [...] "It {{is a question of}} proximity and degree.". [...] "Swift thus indicated that intent is necessary, but alone is not sufficient, to establish the dangerous probability of success that is the object of § 2's prohibition of attempts." ...|$|R
50|$|The Human Development Report goes <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> {{because of}} Africa's {{dependence}} on rain-fed agriculture, widespread poverty, and weak capacity, the water issues caused by climate change impact the continent much more violently compared to developed {{nations that have}} the resources and economic diversity {{to deal with such}} global changes. This heightened potential for drought and falling crop yields will most likely lead to increased poverty, lower incomes, less secure livelihoods, and an increased threat of chronic hunger for the poorest people in sub-Saharan Africa. Overall this means that water stress caused by changing amounts of precipitation is particularly damaging to Africa and thus climate change {{is one of the major}} obstacles the continent must face when trying to secure reliable and clean sources of water.|$|R
50|$|Georgina {{asks about}} Alexandra, who Zach admits is beautiful, but says that isn't all {{he looks for}} in a person. She isn't {{impressed}} by his reasoning, however Zach continues <b>on</b> trying <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> he loves her and had never stopped. Zach reveals that he wants children too, however an upset Georgina leaves and Ben has <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> Zach what had been going on. At work, Georgina's worker reveals that he understands why she left and leaves before Zach comes in with a dozen roses.|$|R
25|$|In 2000, {{the world}} {{population}} was 6.2 billion. The UN estimates that by 2050 {{there will be}} an additional 3.5 billion people with most of the growth in developing countries that already suffer water stress. Thus, water demand will increase unless there are corresponding increases in water conservation and recycling of this vital resource. In building on the data presented here by the UN, the World Bank goes <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> access to water for producing food {{will be one of the}} main challenges in the decades to come. Access to water will need to be balanced with the importance of managing water itself in a sustainable way while taking into account the impact of climate change, and other environmental and social variables.|$|E
25|$|While the {{compromise}} {{was a success}} for the residents of Wheatley Hills, according to Robert Caro in The Power Broker, the $175,000 was a smokescreen {{for the fact that}} the land purchasing would cost $2.25million (1929USD) and rather than the locals, the taxpayers would be stuck with the majority (over 90%) of the bill from the acquisition. The $175,000 also was claimed by Moses to have been spending for the entire cost of the detour, rather than the land acquisition. Caro goes <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> the accommodations made for the citizens of Wheatley Hills denied Long Islanders some of the parks on the North Shore that had been proposed by Moses, pardoning Caumsett State Park. Caro also explained that along with the $10,000 bribe that Moses had accepted, the illegal purchases of the Taylor Estate would turn him into a beating stick for the politicians of New York to get him to stop fighting.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} {{tranquilizer}} or antipsychotic medication, chlorpromazine (Thorazine), a typical antipsychotic, {{was discovered in}} 1951 and introduced into clinical practice shortly thereafter. Clozapine (Clozaril), an atypical antipsychotic, fell out of favor due to concerns over drug-induced agranulocytosis. Following research indicating its effectiveness in treatment-resistant schizophrenia {{and the development of}} an adverse event monitoring system, clozapine re-emerged as a viable antipsychotic. According to Barker (2003), the three most-accepted atypical drugs are clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine. However, he goes <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> clozapine is usually the last resort when other drugs fail. Clozapine can cause agranulocytosis (a decreased number of white blood cells), requiring blood monitoring for the patient. Despite the effectiveness of clozapine for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, agents with a more favorable side-effect profile were sought-after for widespread use. During the 1990s, olanzapine, risperidone, and quetiapine were introduced, with ziprasidone and aripiprazole following in the early 2000s. The atypical anti-psychotic paliperidone was approved by the FDA in late 2006.|$|E
50|$|What Solomon means, Pascalis goes <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain,</b> is not <b>that</b> {{we should}} avoid the {{interpretation}} of dreams, but rather that we should recognize that littera occidit, spiritus autem vivificat ("The letter kills, but the spirit brings to life"). Reason allows us to investigate the truth that is symbolized.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} day, {{this time}} at a ballroom dancing class, Blair continually manages to step onto the toes of Delancy's friend, Portia, who is Blair's dance partner. As a result, Blair is kept behind after class by Miss Privet, {{who had been the}} instructor. Now alone, she tells Blair that Dame Devin wanted her to be expelled, a desire which had almost been granted; however, Miss Privet admits to Blair that she is aware of her personal reasons for wanting to become a Lady Royal (which is solely to better support her family), and so decides to tutor her, herself. She goes <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> Blair <b>that</b> each lesson her students learn simply isn't for superficial reasons, but rather to instill a better sense of character and confidence within each of girl.|$|R
60|$|Archie {{felt that}} it was {{incumbent}} <b>on</b> him <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> his visit <b>to</b> her house had been made under other circumstances--that he had brought money instead of seeking it; and had, in fact, gone to her simply in the way of her own trade. He did begin some preliminaries to this explanation; but as the servant was there, and as his brother might come out from the dining-room, and as also he was aware that he could hardly tell the story much to his own advantage, he stopped abruptly, and, looking piteously at Doodles, implored him to take the lady away.|$|R
25|$|On March 12, 2011, Dana White {{revealed}} that Zuffa had purchased Strikeforce. White went <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> Strikeforce will operate {{as an independent}} promotion, and that Scott Coker will continue to run the promotion. Strikeforce CEO Scott Coker announced the return of Fedor Emelianenko on an unspecified July or August event and said that Zuffa-owned company would continue to co-promote with M-1 Global. Following the purchase, the UFC signed many of Strikeforce's top stars and champions, such as Jason Miller, Nick Diaz, Dan Henderson, Alistair Overeem, and Cung Le. Under Zuffa's ownership, Strikeforce made minor changes, including adopting the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts in full, closing the promotion's men's weight classes below lightweight, and ceasing promotion of amateur undercard bouts. After an extension was reached to continue Strikeforce through 2012, the promotion's heavyweight division (sans Heavyweight Grand Prix finalists) was merged into the UFC, and the promotion's Challengers series was ended.|$|E
25|$|At Slammiversary, Joe betrayed A.J. Styles {{and turned}} on all the fans by helping Kurt Angle win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship in the King of the Mountain match, and thus turned heel. On the June 25 episode of Impact!, Joe officially joined The Main Event Mafia after having spent the last five months taking them out. This was {{revealed}} by Angle, to be a master plan to fool the TNA Frontline and the attacks were all planned by Joe and the Mafia in advance. Joe then went <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> he joined the Mafia for the money that was invested by Jenna Morasca and for the power and also debuted a new rap themed, entrance music. Throughout the night, he carried out attacks with the Mafia on Styles and Daniels {{and the leader of}} the Mafia, Sting, who was kicked out of the Mafia as leader and once again replaced with Kurt Angle. At Victory Road, Joe faced Sting in a grudge match. Late in the match, Taz made his TNA debut and helped Joe beat Sting, thus revealing himself as his new adviser. At Hard Justice Joe defeated Homicide to win the X Division title for the fourth time. After winning this title, Joe feuded with his longtime rival Daniels and defeated him at No Surrender. On the October 8 edition of Impact! Joe lost the X Division title to Amazing Red after Bobby Lashley interfered in the match. At Bound for Glory Lashley defeated Joe in a submission match with a referee stoppage. On the following edition of Impact! Kurt Angle turned into a fan favorite, thus signaling the end of the Main Event Mafia. The following month at Turning Point Joe unsuccessfully challenged TNA World Heavyweight Champion A.J. Styles for the title in a three-way match, also involving Daniels.|$|E
500|$|Stan Ulam, {{who knew}} von Neumann well, {{described}} his mastery of mathematics this way: [...] "Most mathematicians know one method. For example, Norbert Wiener had mastered Fourier transforms. Some mathematicians have mastered two methods and might really impress {{someone who knows}} only one of them. John von Neumann had mastered three methods." [...] He went <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> the three methods were: ...|$|E
60|$|Fortunately some of {{the other}} women, who had been away {{collecting}} cocoa-nuts, arrived just then, and somewhat relieved the men by prevailing <b>on</b> the mother <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>that,</b> although she could not say positively her child had fallen over the cliffs, or come by any other mishap, Sally had nevertheless disappeared early in the forenoon, and that she had been searching for her ever since without success.|$|R
5000|$|Like many Buddhist modernists, Taixu was {{interested}} in using tactics such as cultural translation (a method of <b>explaining</b> Buddhism) so <b>that</b> non Buddhists can better comprehend {{the complexity of the}} tradition. For example, in his essay [...] "Science and Buddhism," [...] Taixu makes a translation of the Buddha's teaching that inside of every drop of water, there are 84 thousand microbes, a Buddhist teaching that basically states that within our world there are many more worlds. He goes <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> how <b>that</b> when one looks inside of a microscope one {{will be able to see}} these tiny microbes and that each one is a life of its own.|$|R
25|$|The main {{distinction}} between the MCA and AEDPA, the Court went <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain,</b> was <b>that</b> AEDPA applies in practice to those prisoners serving a sentence after having been tried in open court and whose sentences have been upheld on direct appeal, whereas the MCA suspends {{the application of the}} writ to those detainees whose guilt has not yet been legally determined. In other words, the comparison to AEDPA was found by the majority to be misplaced, in that AEDPA's limitations on habeas review stemmed from cases that had already been to trial, whereas the cases involving MCA had not been to trial and therefore habeas review would have been appropriate.|$|R
500|$|Yarrell at once goes <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> the crossbills {{are unique}} in {{making use of}} [...] "any lateral motion of the mandibles, {{and it is my}} object here to {{describe}} the bony structure and muscles by which this peculiar and powerful action is obtained." [...] He explains the anatomy and how the jaws are closed, and then how their unique side-to-side motion is achieved: ...|$|E
500|$|Cott goes <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> the {{right-hand}} drawing shows the effect [...] "of broken surroundings in further blending and confusing the picture", observing {{that this is}} the closest to what is seen in nature. His readers are invited to look first at {{the right-hand}} images to gain an idea of the power of [...] "these optical devices" [...] as camouflage, putting off the moment when the animal is actually recognised.|$|E
500|$|In this sonnet, {{the speaker}} is {{explaining}} that though he has been writing poetry in adoration of his muse less frequently, his feelings for him are as strong as they've ever been. Gwynne Blakemore Evans believes {{that this is an}} attempt to apologize for a period of silence. The poet goes <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> his silence is simply him not wanting to cheapen his praise by making it common. Below is a paraphrase of the sonnet written in prose: ...|$|E
60|$|This point settled, and my {{position}} well ascertained, I addressed {{him on the}} subject of my affairs with that genuine frankness which full confidence can alone inspire. It was a pleasure to him to be so appealed to; he thanked me for giving him this opportunity of using a little exertion in my behalf. I went <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> him <b>that</b> my wish was not so much to be helped, as to be put into the way of helping myself; of him I did not want exertion--that was to be my part--but only information and recommendation. Soon after I rose to go. He held out his hand at parting--an action of greater significance with foreigners than with Englishmen. As I exchanged a smile with him, I thought the benevolence of his truthful face was better than the intelligence of my own. Characters of my order experience a balm-like solace in the contact of such souls as animated the honest breast of Victor Vandenhuten.|$|R
5000|$|The song, {{with music}} by former Westlife member Bryan McFadden, is a ballad in which Doran sings to his lover about {{the depth of}} his {{feelings}} ("I can see my future/When I'm looking in your eyes/And I can sense security/Just by you bein' in my life"). He goes <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain,</b> however, <b>that</b> if his relationship should end, [...] "Then I would still stand tall/'Cause behind it all/You're the one who's made a winner out of me". As was the case for many of the male entrants at that year's Contest, Doran wore a white suit in his performance. There was also a lack of movement, particularly in comparison with those entries which dominated the scoring.|$|R
30|$|Currently, however, {{there are}} {{relatively}} few {{systems that are}} utilizing intermodal transport. Reis [48] tells us that at an EU level, 75  % of freight is transported via road with just 5  % of this transport being classed as intermodal. The paper then goes <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> the barriers <b>that</b> face intermodal transport; it is complex to produce and relies on integration of disparate transport networks, and the regulatory framework is often inadequate.|$|R
500|$|Stace {{then goes}} <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> all {{religions}} say that religious revelation is ineffable, because no words or concepts {{can be applied}} to God who is without qualities or predicates. Thus, God cannot be comprehended by the intellect, but is apprehended by intuition. [...] "... it is of the very nature of intellect to involve the subject-object opposition. But in the mystic experience this opposition is transcended. Therefore the intellect is incapable of understanding it. Therefore it is incomprehensible, ineffable." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{additional}} {{reference to}} the work as a [...] "response" [...] to trends of the time is made in a later note: [...] "The repressed, armored, uncertain and sexually frozen man in Arkham Asylum {{was intended as a}} critique of the '80s interpretation of Batman as violent, driven, and borderline psychopathic." [...] Morrison goes <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> his symbolic conception of the character is for this book alone, and that his other work involving Batman has cast him in a far different light. He explains, ...|$|E
500|$|Before {{she entered}} Neighbours, Natasha was {{described}} as being [...] "spirited, rebellious and conniving". Channel Five's Holy Soap website described her as being a [...] "teen rebel". After she entered the show, Network Ten described Natasha as having a [...] "major attitude" [...] and a [...] "burning desire to rule the school." [...] They also go <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> Natasha never misses {{an opportunity to be}} the centre of attention and does whatever it takes to be noticed. However, Natasha really wants to get her father's attention and she chooses to rebel, so that he notices her. TV Soap called Natasha a vixen and Novakovic describes Natasha as being [...] "manipulative" [...] and knowing what she wants.|$|E
5000|$|In 2006, she {{switched}} to a major label, the popular Avex Trax. Her first major label single, [...] "Yogoreta Shitagi", was released on her birthday, and received minor attention. [...] "Yogoreta Shitagi" [...] was written about an ex-boyfriend who was cheating on her and is written from the former boyfriend's point of view. Nakamura called this individual <b>on</b> the telephone <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> the song she had written about him was to be her debut single.|$|R
5000|$|During a New York Film Festival {{press conference}} for the film, De Palma {{mentioned}} that Redacted is itself redacted, due to Magnolia Pictures owner Mark Cuban [...] "being disturbed" [...] by the ending photo montage's imagery. A {{voice from the}} audience called out [...] "That's not true"; with the speaker identifying himself as Eamonn Bowles, president of Magnolia Pictures. The producer of the film later appeared <b>on</b> stage <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> the images were taken out {{not because they were}} disturbing, but because of concerns about the possibility that relatives of the dead persons appearing on the photographs might bring lawsuits for emotional distress and the like. Magnolia, he said, had been put in [...] "an untenable legal position" [...] making the movie uninsurable.|$|R
5000|$|Federalist No. 56 is {{an essay}} by James Madison, the fifty-sixth of The Federalist Papers. It was {{published}} on February 16, 1788 under the pseudonym Publius, the name under which all The Federalist Papers were published. Continuing from Federalist No. 55, this paper discusses {{the size of}} the United States House of Representatives. It is titled, [...] "The Same Subject Continued: The Total Number of the House of Representatives." [...] In this paper, Madison addresses the criticism that the House of Representatives is too small to sufficiently understand the varied interests of all its constituents. He goes <b>on</b> further <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> in this representatives represent large amounts of people, effectively explaining why the [...] "smaller" [...] size of the House of Representatives was sufficient.|$|R
