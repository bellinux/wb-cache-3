40|$|A {{substantial}} body {{of literature}} on new forms <b>of</b> <b>organizing</b> has forecast the end of bureaucracy. More recent empirical studies, however, indicate that high-performing organizations are adopting dual forms <b>of</b> <b>organizing</b> in which the controllability advantages associated with traditional forms work to complement and support the responsiveness attributes of new forms <b>of</b> <b>organizing.</b> The paradox is that, if organizations discard the key planning, co-ordinating and direction-setting mechanisms of traditional forms <b>of</b> <b>organizing,</b> they also remove the stabilizing dimensions of organizational form that are essential in periods of uncertainty and change. The challenge for organizations lies in learning how to manage the tensions or dualities between traditional and new forms <b>of</b> <b>organizing,</b> a process demanding the arbitration of continuity and change. This paper explores the concept of dualities and its salience in the management <b>of</b> <b>organizing</b> forms. First, the nature of dualities is explained; secondly, a set of characteristics is developed to describe the behaviour of dualities; and thirdly, suggestions are presented for arbitrating the tensions that exist in organizing form dualities. These three contributions are relevant because they signal the route to the effective creation and management <b>of</b> <b>organizing</b> form dualities, the benefit {{of which is the}} constructive combination of dynamic capabilities (underpinning innovation and responsiveness, the hallmarks of new forms <b>of</b> <b>organizing)</b> and operational capabilities (underpinning stability and efficiency, the hallmarks of traditional forms <b>of</b> <b>organizing)</b> ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} a survey <b>of</b> <b>organizing</b> forms in Australia 2 ̆ 7 s largest public companies between 2000 and 2004. The study sought to identify trends in forms <b>of</b> <b>organizing</b> {{and the extent to}} which the uptake of new forms led to a decrease in traditional forms <b>of</b> <b>organizing.</b> The analysis revealed changes across the organizational dimensions of structures, processes and boundaries. While Australian firms were clearly interested in exploring new forms <b>of</b> <b>organizing,</b> uptake was not universal, nor at the expense of traditional forms <b>of</b> <b>organizing.</b> An admixture <b>of</b> traditional and new, or dual, forms <b>of</b> <b>organizing</b> emerged as the preferred response to environmental turbulence. This paper employs and extends duality theory to explain the changes that occurred in Australian public companies over the four year period. Duality theory is operationalized in terms of five duality characteristics, which are employed to assess the composition and balance of traditional and new fOlms <b>of</b> <b>organizing.</b> The paper proposes that a dualities aware perspective offers a potential way forward in managing the balance between ostensibly contradictory forces of continuity and change. <br /...|$|R
30|$|Thus, {{our study}} aims to analyze a digital {{entrepreneurship}} ecosystem {{to answer the}} question of “how does a digital entrepreneurship ecosystem organize to support digital innovations?” To answer this question, we adopt the forms <b>of</b> <b>organizing,</b> as synthesized by Puranam et al. (2014) based on prior literature related to the forms <b>of</b> <b>organizing,</b> as a theoretical lens. Despite the different forms <b>of</b> <b>organizing,</b> they all address four universal problems: task division, task allocation, reward distribution and information flow. These four organizing problems are synthesized from the prior literature and they commonly exist in many forms <b>of</b> <b>organizing,</b> such as innovation networks, innovation clusters, ecosystems and self-organizing groups.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{preliminary results}} from a survey of new forms <b>of</b> <b>organizing</b> in the highest grossing Australian owned companies. The Australian NewForms Survey draws on the groundbreaking Innovative Forms <b>of</b> <b>Organizing</b> (INNFORM) Survey conducted in Europe, USA and Japan in the late 1990 s (Whittington, Pettigrew, Peck, Fenton, and Conyon 1999). The NewForms study seeks to identify emerging trends in forms <b>of</b> <b>organizing</b> within Australia&# 039;s largest companies {{and the extent to}} which the uptake of new forms <b>of</b> <b>organizing</b> signals a commensurate decrease in traditional forms. The analysis focuses on changes across three organizational dimensions: structures, processes and boundaries. The results suggest that for organizational structures there has been a significant shift from operational to strategic decentralization. For organizational processes, there have been substantial increases in both horizontal and vertical linkages and in the adoption of a range of new human resource practices. In relation to boundaries, alliances and partnerships have increased, signaling a greater focus on mainstream business activities and a move away from peripheral diversification. Overall, the prevalence of new forms <b>of</b> <b>organizing</b> has increased within Australian companies, but these new forms <b>of</b> <b>organizing</b> have emerged alongside traditional forms. This finding is consistent with research in other countries, and provides further evidence of complementarities between new and traditional forms of organizin...|$|R

30|$|Since DEEs are {{different}} from traditional forms <b>of</b> <b>organizing</b> as they lack traditional organizing elements such as formal authority, the solutions to these four problems may be different and worthwhile exploring (Puranam et al., 2014). Thus, the <b>organizing</b> process <b>of</b> a DEE is relatively novel and we can treat a DEE as a “new” form <b>of</b> <b>organizing.</b> This theoretical lens enables us to analyze a DEE as an organization rather than a pure combination of actors. These universal problems <b>of</b> <b>organizing</b> provide us with an operational framework to analyze the organizing activities in DEEs.|$|R

The commission established a minimum weekly wage of $8.25 for women working in Portland's laundries. By 1917, the work day was reduced to an eight-hour maximum.

We focus on two types <b>of</b> <b>organizing</b> costs; bargaining costs and information costs. Using survey data collected among subsidiary managers in two Norwegian companies in the consulting and certification services industry, we show that business atmosphere significantly reduces both types <b>of</b> <b>organizing</b> costs, whereas distance increases bargaining costs.
