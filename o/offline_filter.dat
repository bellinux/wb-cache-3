40|$|Isomeric epoxydiols from {{isoprene}} photooxidation (IEPOX) {{have been}} shown to produce substantial amounts of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) mass and are therefore considered a major isoprene-derived SOA precursor. Heterogeneous reactions of IEPOX on atmospheric aerosols form various aerosol-phase components or "tracers" that contribute to the SOA mass burden. A limited number of the reaction rate constants for these acid-catalyzed aqueous-phase tracer formation reactions have been constrained through bulk laboratory measurements. We have designed a chemical box model with multiple experimental constraints to explicitly simulate gas- and aqueous-phase reactions during chamber experiments of SOA growth from IEPOX uptake onto acidic sulfate aerosol. The model is constrained by measurements of the IEPOX reactive uptake coefficient, IEPOX and aerosol chamber wall losses, chamber-measured aerosol mass and surface area concentrations, aerosol thermodynamic model calculations, and offline filter-based measurements of SOA tracers. By requiring the model output to match the SOA growth and <b>offline</b> <b>filter</b> measurements collected during the chamber experiments, we derive estimates of the tracer formation reaction rate constants that have not yet been measured or estimated for bulk solutions...|$|E
40|$|The {{reactive}} partitioning of cis and trans β-IEPOX {{was investigated}} on hydrated inorganic seed particles, without {{the addition of}} acids. No organic aerosol (OA) formation was observed on dry ammonium sulfate (AS); however, prompt and efficient OA growth was observed for the cis and trans β-IEPOX on AS seeds at liquid water contents of 40 – 75 % of the total particle mass. OA formation from IEPOX is a kinetically limited process, thus the OA growth continues {{if there is a}} reservoir of gas-phase IEPOX. There appears to be no differences, within error, in the OA growth or composition attributable to the cis / trans isomeric structures. Reactive uptake of IEPOX onto hydrated AS seeds with added base (NaOH) also produced high OA loadings, suggesting the pH dependence for OA formation from IEPOX is weak for AS particles. No OA formation, after particle drying, was observed on seed particles where Na + was substituted for NH 4 +. The Henry's Law partitioning of IEPOX was measured on NaCl particles (ionic strength ~ 9 M) to be 3 × 10 7 M atm − 1 (− 50 / + 100 %). A small quantity of OA was produced when NH 4 + was present in the particles, but the chloride (Cl -) anion was substituted for sulfate (SO 4 2 -), possibly suggesting differences in nucleophilic strength of the anions. Online time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometry and <b>offline</b> <b>filter</b> analysis provide evidence of oxygenated hydrocarbons, organosulfates, and amines in the particle organic composition.

Our results suggest that submicron aerosols composition was generally similar across the winter of different years and was mainly composed of organics (60  %), sulfate (15  %) and nitrate (11  %). Positive matrix factorization of high- and unit-mass resolution spectra identified four primary organic aerosol (POA) factors from traffic, cooking, biomass burning (BBOA) and coal combustion (CCOA) emissions as well as two secondary OA (SOA) factors. POA dominated OA, on average accounting for 56  %, with CCOA being the largest contributor (20  %). Both CCOA and BBOA showed distinct polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) spectral signatures, indicating that PAHs in winter were mainly from coal combustion (66  %) and biomass burning emissions (18  %). BBOA was highly correlated with levoglucosan, a tracer compound for biomass burning (r 2 [*]=[*] 0. 93), and made a considerable contribution to OA in winter (9  %). An aqueous-phase-processed SOA (aq-OOA) that was strongly correlated with particle liquid water content, sulfate and S-containing ions (e. g. CH 2 SO 2 +) was identified. On average aq-OOA contributed 12  % to the total OA and played a dominant role in increasing oxidation degrees of OA at high RH levels (>  50  %).

40|$|Long-term {{electrocardiogram}} (ECG) often {{suffers from}} relevant noise. Baseline wander {{in particular is}} pronounced in ECG recordings using dry or esophageal electrodes, which are dedicated for prolonged registration. While analog high-pass filters introduce phase distortions, reliable <b>offline</b> <b>filtering</b> of the baseline wander implies a computational burden {{that has to be}} put in relation to the increase in signal-to-baseline ratio (SBR). Here we present a graphics processor unit (GPU) based parallelization method to speed up <b>offline</b> baseline wander <b>filter</b> algorithms, namely the wavelet, finite, and infinite impulse response, moving mean, and moving median filter. Individual filter parameters were optimized with respect to the SBR increase based on ECGs from the Physionet database superimposed to auto-regressive modeled, real baseline wander. A Monte-Carlo simulation showed that for low input SBR the moving median filter outperforms any other method but negatively affects ECG wave detection. In contrast, the infinite impulse response filter is preferred in case of high input SBR. However, the parallelized wavelet filter is processed 500 and 4 times faster than these two algorithms on the GPU, respectively, and offers superior baseline wander suppression in low SBR situations. Using a signal segment of 64 mega samples that is filtered as entire unit, wavelet filtering of a 7 -day high-resolution ECG is computed within less than 3 seconds. Taking the high filtering speed into account, the GPU wavelet filter is the most efficient method to remove baseline wander present in long-term ECGs, with which computational burden can be strongly reduced...|$|R

40|$|Extracellular {{recordings}} are {{the primary}} tool for extracting neuronal spike trains in-vivo. One of the crucial pre-processing stages of this signal is the high-pass filtration used to isolate neuronal spiking activity. Filters are characterized by changes in the magnitude and phase of different frequencies. While filters are typically chosen for their effect on magnitudes, {{little attention has been}} paid to the impact of these filters on the phase of each frequency. In this study we show that in the case of nonlinear phase shifts generated by most online and <b>offline</b> <b>filters,</b> the signal is severely distorted, resulting in an alteration of the spike waveform. This distortion leads to a shape that deviates from the original waveform as a function of its constituent frequencies, and a dramatic reduction in the SNR of the waveform that disrupts spike detectability. Currently, the vast majority of articles utilizing extracellular data are subject to these distortions since most commercial and academic hardware and software utilize nonlinear phase filters. We show that this severe problem can be avoided by recording wide-band signals followed by zero phase filtering, or alternatively corrected by reversed filtering of a narrow-band filtered, and in some cases even segmented signals. Implementation of either zero phase filtering or phase correction of the nonlinear phase filtering reproduces the original spike waveforms and increases the spike detection rates while reducing the number of false negative and positive errors. This process, in turn, helps eliminate subsequent errors in downstream analyses and misinterpretations of the results...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Transcranial {{magnetic}} stimulation (TMS) is {{a technique}} in which a pulsed magnetic field created by a coil positioned next to the scalp is used to locally depolarize neurons in brain cortex. TMS can be combined with electroencephalography (EEG) to visualize regional brain activity in response to direct cortical stimulation, making it a promising tool for studying brain function. A technical drawback of EEG/TMS coregistrations is that the TMS impulse generates high amplitude and long-lasting artifacts that corrupt the EEG trace. In this brief, an <b>offline</b> Kalman <b>filter</b> approach to remove TMS-induced artifacts from EEG recordings is proposed. The Kalman filter {{is applied to the}} linear system arising from the combination of the dynamic models describing EEG and TMS signals generation.

40|$|Long-term {{electrocardiogram}} (ECG) signals might {{suffer from}} relevant baseline disturbances during physical activity. Motion artifacts {{in particular are}} more pronounced with dry surface or esophageal electrodes which are dedicated to prolonged ECG recording. In this paper we present a method called baseline wander tracking (BWT) that tracks and rejects strong baseline disturbances and avoids concurrent saturation of the analog front-end. The proposed algorithm shifts the baseline level of the ECG signal {{to the middle of}} the dynamic input range. Due to the fast offset shifts, that produce much steeper signal portions than the normal ECG waves, the true ECG signal can be reconstructed <b>offline</b> and <b>filtered</b> using computationally intensive algorithms. Based on Monte Carlo simulations we observed reconstruction errors mainly caused by the non-linearity inaccuracies of the DAC. However, the signal to error ratio of the BWT is higher compared to an analog front-end featuring a dynamic input ranges above 15 mV if a synthetic ECG signal was used. The BWT is additionally able to suppress (electrode) offset potentials without introducing long transients. Due to its structural simplicity, memory efficiency and the DC coupling capability, the BWT is dedicated to high integration required in long-term and low-power ECG recording systems...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to develop a}} novel {{technique}} for the estimation of firing rate dynamics from single-unit recordings of neural pulse trains. This method applies an <b>offline</b> digital <b>filtering</b> technique to extract information transmitted by a neuron in teens of a rate code. While there is increasing evidence that the traditional rate coding cannot account for all the information transmitted by a cell, and that information may also be contained in the precise timing of spikes, the firing rate signal remains the benchmark by which the vast majority of electrophysiological studies relating neural activity to functional behaviour have been interpreted. Nevertheless, there {{does not seem to be}} an agreement on a single definition of a rate code let alone a consensus on an optimal estimation method. This study raises significant concerns about the validity of some of the most common methods in systems neuroscience, and proposes a simple yet more robust alternative. This latter is based on the convolution of the spike train with an optimally designed Kaiser window. Using computer-simulated as well as experimental data obtained from single-unit recordings of vestibular canal afferents, the proposed technique is shown to consistently outperform the current methods and even to permit robust estimations under time-varying conditions. These results suggest that estimates acquired with the conventional methods are biased and hence models of neural dynamics based on these latter may not be reliable...|$|R

The comparison was performed over two months (May and June 2010) at a coastal site characterized by low local pollution, located in the Southern Italy (Central Mediterranean basin). The online measurements of the above inorganic ions and carbonaceous components of the aerosols were carried out using an Ambient Ion Monitor-Ion Chromatograph (AIM IC URG 9000 -D) and a Sunset Laboratory Model- 4 Semi-Continuous OCEC Field Analyzer, respectively, while the offline analyses were performed with two ion chromatographs instruments (Dionex DX- 120 and Dionex 500) and a Sunset Laboratory Dual-Optical Carbonaceous Analyzer (Sunset Laboratory). The collocation of instruments allowed to evaluate the differences between online and offline daily concentrations and to interpret the origin {{of positive and negative}} sampling artefacts.

The analysis was performed separately for days with and without transport of Saharan dust and revealed significant enhancement of concentrations for both inorganic ions and carbonaceous aerosols in the presence of dust.

Therefore, a combination between parallel and fan beam was done to produce a better spatial resolution. This research introduces a new projection technique by mixing the parallel and fan beam projections that is, Mix Modality between Parallel and Fan Beam Left and Right (MPFBLR), and Mix Modality between Parallel and Fan Beam Centre (MPFBC). These mixed projections need a specific design of a sensor jig by eliminate the collimator to enable two modes of projections to be operated and consequently, this combination will use switching/pulsing technique.

40|$|IntroductionIn this paper, {{we present}} the initial {{results of a}} fully {{programmable}} 128 -channel FPGA and PC-based system that has been developed for medical ultrasound (US) imaging research in our University laboratory (Federal University of Technology - Paraná, Brazil). MethodsIn order to demonstrate the feasibility of the US research system, two applications involving unfocused plane wave transmission and conventional B-mode beamforming were evaluated using a commercial tissue-mimicking phantom and a 3. 2 MHz 128 -element convex array transducer. ResultsTesting {{results show that the}} hardware platform is able to synthesize arbitrary pulses up to 100 Vpp with second order harmonic distortion below 80 dB. For the first application, a 41 -tap digital FIR bandpass filter was applied to the acquired RF echoes, sampled at 40 MHz with 12 -bit resolution, to improve the noise suppression. In the second application, after <b>offline</b> apodization weighting, <b>filtering,</b> delay-and-sum processing, envelope detection, log compression and scan conversion, the reconstructed B-mode image is displayed over a 50 dB range. DiscussionThe presented results indicate that the open US imaging system can be used to support different ultrasonic transmission and reception strategies, which typically cannot be implemented in conventional data flow architectures that are mainly based on hardware...|$|R
40|$|Aerosol {{hygroscopic}} properties {{were linked}} to its chemical composition by rising complementary online mass spectrometric techniques in a comprehensive chemical characterization study at a rural mountaintop station in central Germany in August 2012. In particular, atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-mass,spectrOmetry ((-) APCI-MS) provided measurements of organic acids, organosulfates, and nitrooxy-organosulfates in the particle phase at 1 min time resolution. <b>Offline</b> analysis of <b>filter</b> samples enabled us to determine the molecular composition of signals appearing in. the online (-) APCI-MS spectra. Aerosol Mass spectrometry (AMS) provided quantitative measurements of total submicrometer organics, nitrate, sulfate, and ammonium. Inorganic sulfate measurements were achieved by semionline ion chromatography and were compared to the AMS total sulfate mass. We found that up to 40 % of the total sulfate mass fraction can be covalently bonded to organic molecules. This finding is supported by both on- and offline soft ionization techniques, which confirmed the presence of several organosulfates and nitrooxy-organosulfates in the particle phase. The chemical composition analysis was compared to hygroscopicity measurements derived from a cloud condensation nuclei counter. We observed that the hygroscopicity parameter (kappa) that is derived from organic mass fractions determined by AMS measurements may overestimate the observed kappa up to 0. 2 if a high fraction of sulfate is bonded to organic molecules and little photochemical aging is exhibited...|$|R
30|$|All {{trials were}} {{initiated}} with participants standing on an elevated platform at either of two heights: 22  cm (low) and 44  cm (high). The low height {{was consistent with}} the height of one riser for typical household stairs, while the high {{was consistent with the}} height of two risers. Participants were asked to step outwards off the platform with the rear leg straight and drop such that both feet simultaneously contacted two force plates (OR 6 - 7, AMTI, Massachusetts), with one foot on each force plate. To standardize upper body movement between participants and conditions, participants were asked to lace fingers and maintain their hands over the abdomen during all trials. To avoid participants using different strategies when leaving the elevated platform, the investigator demonstrated the step-off technique and instructed participants explicitly to not jump off or lower themselves. Force plate signals were sampled at 1000  Hz and <b>filtered</b> <b>offline</b> using a Butterworth 4 th order low-pass filter with an 8  Hz cutoff. The filter cutoff frequency was determined using a residual analysis approach [32] over 0.5 – 25  Hz range in 0.5  Hz steps with vertical ground reaction force (GRF) signal from a randomly selected trial recorded for the first four participants; the average cutoff frequency was used. A similar drop-landing methodology has been previously validated and utilized by Niehoff et al. [33] to examine joint loading in response to drop landing in a similar cohort.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: An {{increased}} {{production and}} use of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is occurring worldwide. In parallel, a growing concern is emerging on the adverse effects the unintentional inhalation of CNTs can have on humans. There is currently a debate regarding which exposure metrics and measurement strategies are the most relevant to investigate workplace exposures to CNTs. This study investigated workplace CNT emissions {{using a combination of}} time-integrated filter sampling for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and direct reading aerosol instruments (DRIs). Material and Methods: Field measurements were performed during small-scale manufacturing of multiwalled carbon nanotubes using the arc discharge technique. Measurements with highly time- and size-resolved DRI techniques were carried out both in the emission and background (far-field) zones. Novel classifications and counting criteria were set up for the SEM method. Three classes of CNT-containing particles were defined: type 1 : particles with aspect ratio length:width > 3 : 1 (fibrous particles); type 2 : particles without fibre characteristics but with high CNT content; and type 3 : particles with visible embedded CNTs. Results: Offline sampling using SEM showed emissions of CNT-containing particles in 5 out of 11 work tasks. The particles were classified into the three classes, of which type 1, fibrous CNT particles contributed 37 %. The concentration of all CNT-containing particles and the occurrence of the particle classes varied strongly between work tasks. Based on the emission measurements, it was assessed that more than 85 % of the exposure originated from open handling of CNT powder during the Sieving, mechanical work-up, and packaging work task. The DRI measurements provided complementary information, which combined with SEM provided information on: (i) the background adjusted emission concentration from each work task in different particle size ranges, (ii) identification of the key procedures in each work task that lead to emission peaks, (iii) identification of emission events that affect the background, thereby leading to far-field exposure risks for workers other than the operator of the work task, and (iv) the fraction of particles emitted from each source that contains CNTs. Conclusions: There is an urgent need for a standardized/harmonized method for electron microscopy (EM) analysis of CNTs. The SEM method developed in this study can form the basis for such a harmonized protocol for the counting of CNTs. The size-resolved DRI techniques are commonly not specific enough to selective analysis of CNT-containing particles and thus cannot yet replace <b>offline</b> time-integrated <b>filter</b> sampling followed by SEM. A combination of EM and DRI techniques offers the most complete characterization of workplace emissions of CNTs today...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{ability of}} {{secondary}} organic aerosol (SOA) produced from the ozonolysis of ?-pinene and monoterpene mixtures (?-pinene, ?-pinene, limonene and 3 -carene) to become cloud droplets was investigated. Monoterpene SOA is quite active and {{would likely be}} {{a good source of}} cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) in the atmosphere. A static CCN counter and a Scanning Mobility CCN Analyser (a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer coupled with a Continuous Flow counter) were used for the CCN measurements. A decrease in CCN activation diameter for ?-pinene SOA of approximately 3 nm h ? 1 was observed as the aerosol continued to react with oxidants. Hydroxyl radicals further oxidize the SOA particles thereby enhancing the particle CCN activity with time. The initial concentrations of ozone and monoterpene precursor (for concentrations lower than 40 ppb) do not appear to affect the activity of the resulting SOA. Köhler Theory Analysis (KTA) is used to infer the molar mass of the SOA sampled online and <b>offline</b> from atomized <b>filter</b> samples. KTA suggests that the aged aerosol (both from ?-pinene and the mixed monoterpene oxidation) is primarily water-soluble (around 70 ? 80 %), with an estimated average molar mass of 180 ± 55 g mol ? 1 (consistent with existing SOA speciation studies). CCN activity measurements of the SOA mixed with (NH 4) 2 SO 4 suggest that the organic can depress surface tension by as much as 10 nM m ? 1 (with respect to pure water). The droplet growth kinetics of SOA samples are similar to (NH 4) 2 SO 4, except at low supersaturation, where SOA tends to grow more slowly. The CCN activity of ?-pinene and mixed monoterpene SOA can be modelled by a very simple implementation of Köhler theory, assuming complete dissolution of the particles, no dissociation into ions, molecular weight of 180 g mol ? 1, density of 1. 5 g cm ? 3, and surface tension to within 10 ? 15 % of water...|$|R
