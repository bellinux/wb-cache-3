Accurate, yet simple, predictions of methane production of ruminants on any feeding regime {{are important in}} the nutrition of ruminants, and in modeling methane produced by them. The current work investigated feed intake, digestibility and methane production by open-circuit respiration measurements in sheep fed 15 untreated, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) treated and anhydrous ammonia (NH 3) treated wheat, barley and <b>oat</b> <b>straws.</b> In vitro fermentation characteristics of straws were obtained from incubations using the Hohenheim gas production system that measured gas production, true substrate degradability, short-chain fatty acid production and efficiency of microbial production from the ratio of truly degraded substrate to gas volume. In the 15 straws, organic matter (OM) intake and in vivo OM digestibility ranged from 563 to 1201 g and from 0. 464 to 0. 643, respectively. Total daily methane production ranged from 13. 0 to 34. 4 l, whereas methane produced/kg OM matter apparently digested in vivo varied from 35. 0 to 61. 8 l. The OM intake {{was positively related to}} total methane production (R 2 = 0. 81, P< 0. 0001), and in vivo OM digestibility was also positively associated with methane production (R 2 = 0. 67, P< 0. 001), but negatively associated with methane production/kg digestible OM intake (R 2 = 0. 61, P< 0. 001). In the in vitro incubations of the 15 straws, the ratio of acetate to propionate ranged from 2. 3 to 2. 8 (P< 0. 05) and efficiencies of microbial production ranged from 0. 21 to 0. 37 (P< 0. 05) at half asymptotic gas production.

40|$|Availability {{and access}} to feed {{resources}} are important constraints to livestock productivity in East Africa. This study examined the production and marketing of livestock feeds in Central and North Rift regions in Kenya. Looking at existing fodder value chains to assess constraints and opportunities using the value chain approach, a rapid reconnaissance survey was conducted in which 93 actors were interviewed along the value chain in November 2010. Fodder marketing takes place at two levels: location (a cluster of 2 - 3 villages) and district. Trading at location level involved input sellers, producers selling directly to rural retailers, rural consumers, or if they were near major district towns, to wholesalers. District level trading involved traders who sourced for fodder outside the district and retailed to wholesalers in major consumer markets within districts {{and to a lesser}} extend retailed in local areas. Service providers such as transporters and feed processors operated at all levels. Input providers comprised of agrovet and general retail shops. Traders comprised of individual traders and cooperative societies. Feed trading is seasonal commonly occurring during the dry season with seasonal price variations at all levels. Feed price have increased by about 15 % within the past year. In all the sites, local feed markets are dominated by livestock keepers selling excess fodder. There are few “specialized” fodder sellers, i. e. non livestock keepers who grew fodder as a source of income. Commonly traded feeds in the dry season were Rhodes grass, maize stovers, <b>oat</b> <b>straws</b> and Lucerne hay that were preferred due to longer storage period. Others forages were Napier grass and roadside harvested grass. Most traded fodder had low gross margins (GM) although foodfeed crops such as oats, sweet potato, etc tended to have higher GM. Actors reported an increasing demand for purchased fodder although they all operated in uncoordinated manner. Cooperative societies {{played a key role in}} linking buyers and sellers, stimulating demand and providing credit. Lack of input capital is perceived as a major constraint more than lack of market because demand for feed is strong during the dry season. This study concludes that there is need to promote feed marketing as a package alongside feed conservation, feed processing as well creating platform for that provide linkages for all actors to operate in coordinated way. Processing of feed is important to reducing bulkiness and handling costs hence easy storage and transportation.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to extract and {{fractionate}} waxes from abundant and low-cost under-utilised renewable resources using a green alternative technology. Through {{a review of the}} literature, the waxes covering agricultural by-products such as straw were identified as a potential source of high value chemicals {{for a wide range of}} applications. Wheat straw waxes were extracted using organic solvents to demonstrate that straw contained high value wax compounds including free fatty acids, fatty alcohols, alkanes, wax esters, sterols, aldehydes and β-diketones. The solvent properties did not affect the composition of the extracts but changed the relative abundance of the different compounds. Linear solvation energy relationship (LSER) was used to model the extraction selectivity relating to total extraction yield and the various wax compounds. Lipophilic and aqueous fractions were separated and LSER results identified that the solvent properties affect only on the quantity of aqueous fraction recovered indicating the selectivity of the solvent. Extraction of wheat straw wax was carried out using a more environmentally friendly supercritical CO 2 extraction. The compositional profiles can be tuned by the manipulation of temperature and pressure and compared with the organic solvent extractions. Optimisation of temperature and pressure was carried out and the total crude yields and wax chemical group yields were modelled using the Chrastil equation to gain a better understanding of conditions required to achieve optimum extraction. The optimisation was used as part of the industrial collaboration scale up with Sundown Products Limited and Evonik Industries where a total of three tonnes of wheat, barley and <b>oat</b> <b>straws</b> were extracted using supercritical CO 2 which yielded approximately 60 kg of wax. The three cereal straws were selected based on yield and composition as raw materials for the scale up from the biomass screen of seven different straws using hexane and ethanol extractions.

Lime pretreatment {{is considered an}} alternative alkali pretreatment, easily to recover and inexpensive that allows to operate under milder conditions of temperature and pressure. The aim of this work was the evaluation of lime pretreatment for bioethanol production from <b>oat</b> <b>straw.</b> Methods: <b>Oat</b> <b>straw</b> was subjected to lime pretreatment at liquid to solid ratio of 10 g/g. The following operational conditions of lime pretreatment were evaluated: temperature (in the range 90 - 134 ºC), time (30 - 120 min) and Ca(OH) 2 /g (01 - 04 g/g). The pretreated <b>oat</b> <b>straw</b> was recovered by filtration, washed until pH= 7 and analysed for chemical composition. The enzymatic susceptibility of lime pretreated solids was evaluated under favourable conditions of solid and enzymes loadings (25 g/g and 25 FPU of CellicTec 2 /g). Selected condition of lime pretreatment (134 ºC, 30 min and 0. 1 g of Ca(OH) 2 /g of <b>oat</b> <b>straw)</b> {{was used for the}} bioethanol production by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (14 % of solids and 20 FPU/g) using an industrial Saccharomyces cerevisiae PE- 2 strain and its metabolic engineered version (MEC 1133) for xylose consumption. Results and Discussion: Under selected conditions (134 ºC for 30 min and a Ca(OH) 2 load of 0. 1 g/g) 96 % of glucan and 77 % of xylan were recovered and 42 % of delignification was achieved. Moreover, the lime pretreatment allowed enhancing the enzymatic saccharification achieving 75 % of glucan to glucose conversion and 100 % of xylan to xylose conversion. The use of MEC 1133 strain increased a 20 % of ethanol concentration comparing to PE- 2 obtaining 41 and 34 g/L of ethanol, respectively.

40|$|The {{two main}} sources of biomass for energy {{generation}} are purpose-grown energy crops and waste materials. Energy crops, such as Miscanthus and short rotation woody crops (coppice), are cultivated mainly for energy purposes and {{are associated with the}} food vs. fuels debate, which is concerned with whether land should be used for fuel rather than food production. The use of residues from agriculture, such as barley, canola, <b>oat</b> and wheat <b>straw,</b> for energy generation circumvents the food vs. fuel dilemma and adds value to existing crops. In fact, these residues represent an abundant, inexpensive and readily available source of renewable lignocellulosic biomass. In order to reduce industry’s operational cost as well as to meet the requirement of raw material for biofuel production, biomass must be processed and handled in an efficient manner. Due to its high moisture content, irregular shape and size, and low bulk density, biomass is very difficult to handle, transport, store, and utilize in its original form. Densification of biomass into durable compacts is an effective solution to these problems and it can reduce material waste. Upon densification, many agricultural biomass materials, especially those from straw and stover, result in a poorly formed pellets or compacts that are more often dusty, difficult to handle and costly to manufacture. This is caused by lack of complete understanding on the natural binding characteristics of the components that make up biomass. An integrated approach to postharvest processing (chopping, grinding and steam explosion), and feasibility study on lab-scale and pilot scale densification of non-treated and steam exploded barley, canola, <b>oat</b> and wheat <b>straw</b> was successfully established to develop baseline data and correlations, that assisted in performing overall specific energy analysis. A new procedure was developed to rapidly characterize the lignocellulosic composition of agricultural biomass using the Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. In addition, baseline knowledge was created to determine the physical and frictional properties of non-treated and steam exploded agricultural biomass grinds. Particle size reduction of agricultural biomass was performed to increase the total surface area, pore size of the material and the number of contact points for inter-particle bonding in the compaction process. Predictive regression equations having higher R 2 values were developed that could be used by biorefineries to perform economic feasibility of establishing a processing plant. Specific energy required by a hammer mill to grind non-treated and steam exploded barley, canola, <b>oat</b> and wheat <b>straw</b> showed a negative power correlation with hammer mill screen sizes. Rapid and cost effective quantification of lignocellulosic components (cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin) of agricultural biomass (barley, canola, oat and wheat) is essential to determine the effect of various pre-treatments (such as steam explosion) on biomass used as feedstock for the biofuel industry. A novel procedure to quantitatively predict lignocellulosic components of non-treated and steam exploded barley, canola, <b>oat</b> and wheat <b>straw</b> was developed using Fourier Transformed Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Regression equations having R 2 values of 0. 89, 0. 99 and 0. 98 were developed to predict the cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin compounds of biomass, respectively. The average absolute difference in predicted and measured cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin in agricultural biomass was 7. 5 %, 2. 5 %, and 3. 8 %, respectively. Application of steam explosion pre-treatment on agricultural straw significantly altered the physical and frictional properties, which has direct significance on designing new and modifying existing bins, hoppers and feeders for handling and storage of straw for biofuel industry. As a result, regression equations were developed to enhance process efficiency by eliminating the need for experimental procedure while designing and manufacturing of new handling equipment. Compaction of low bulk density agricultural biomass is a critical and desirable operation for sustainable and economic availability of feedstock for the biofuel industry. A comprehensive study of the compression characteristics (density of pellet and total specific energy required for compression) of ground non-treated and steam exploded barley, canola, <b>oat</b> and wheat <b>straw</b> obtained from three hammer mill screen sizes of 6. 4, 3. 2 and 1. 6 mm at 10 % moisture content (wb) was conducted. Four preset pressures of 31. 6, 63. 2, 94. 7 and 138. 9 MPa, were applied using an Instron testing machine to compress samples in a cylindrical die. It was determined that the applied pressure (60. 4 %) was the most significant factor affecting pellet density followed by the application of steam explosion pre-treatment (39. 4 %). Similarly, the type of biomass (47. 1 %) is the most significant factor affecting durability followed by the application of pre-treatment (38. 2 %) and grind size (14. 6 %). Also, the applied pressure (58. 3 %) was the most significant factor affecting specific energy required to manufacture pellets followed by the biomass (15. 3 %), pre-treatment (13. 3 %) and grind size (13. 2 %), which had lower but similar effect affect on specific energy. In addition, correlations for pellet density and specific energy with applied pressure and hammer mill screen sizes having highest R 2 values were developed. Higher grind sizes and lower applied pressures resulted in higher relaxations (lower pellet densities) during storage of pellets. Three compression models, namely: Jones model, Cooper-Eaton model, and Kawakita-Ludde model were considered to determine the pressure-volume and pressure-density relationship of non-treated and steam exploded straws. Kawakita-Ludde model provided the best fit to the experimental data having R 2 values of 0. 99 for non-treated straw and 1. 00 for steam exploded biomass samples. The steam exploded straw had higher porosity than non-treated straw. In addition, the steam exploded straw was easier to compress since it had lower yield strength or failure stress values compared to non-treated straw. Pilot scale pelleting experiments were performed on non-treated, steam exploded and customized (adding steam exploded straw grinds in increments of 25 % to non-treated <b>straw)</b> barley, canola, <b>oat</b> and wheat <b>straw</b> grinds obtained from 6. 4, 3. 2, 1. 6 and 0. 8 mm hammer mill screen sizes at 10 % moisture content (wb). The pilot scale pellet mill produced pellets from ground non-treated straw at hammer mill screen sizes of 0. 8 and 1. 6 mm and customized samples having 25 % steam exploded straw at 0. 8 mm. It was observed that the pellet bulk density and particle density are positively correlated. The density and durability of agricultural straw pellets significantly increased with a decrease in hammer mill screen size from 1. 6 mm to 0. 8 mm. Interestingly, customization of agricultural straw by adding 25 % of steam exploded straw by weight resulted in higher durability (> 80 %) pellets but did not improve durability compared to non-treated straw pellets. In addition, durability of pellets was negatively correlated to pellet mill throughput and was positively correlated to specific energy consumption. Total specific energy required to form pellets increased with a decrease in hammer mill screen size from 1. 6 to 0. 8 mm and also the total specific energy significantly increased with customization of straw at 0. 8 mm screen size. It has been determined that the net specific energy available for production of biofuel is a significant portion of original agricultural biomass energy (89 - 94 %) for all agricultural biomass...|$|R
40|$|An unusual {{occurrence}} of actinobacillosis was diagnosed in 4 heifers aged 8 - 15 months and 2 cattle in a dairy herd with 190 Iranian Holstein breed. Anorexia, dysphagia, drooling of normal or foodtinged saliva and presence of warts-like lesions on the dorsal surface of tongue shaft {{were observed in}} a 15 -month-old heifer without showing protrusion of tongue or presenting woody tongue and no involvement of either sulcus lingualis or tongue base. In addition to tongue, soft tissues of oral cavity and pharyngeal region including lymph nodes, salivary glands and tonsils were contained multiple whitish nodules. Histopathologically, typical pyogranulomas of actinobacillosis contained radiating eosinophilic clubs surrounded by many neutrophils were diagnosed. Actinobacillus lignieresii was isolated from the lesions in pure culture. Clinical examination of other animals revealed the presence of different degrees of granulomatous abscesses in soft tissues including skin around mandibles in at least 3 heifers aged 8 - 11 months and 2 cattle. Due to 4 recent droughty years feeding the heifers, dry cows and low milk producing cattle by cheap <b>oat</b> and wheat <b>straw</b> mixed with plant awns could {{be the cause of}} this event...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} based on a field experiment established on very acidic medium soil (silt loam). The experimental design included 4 soil fertilization treatments: O, NPK, NPK + MgSO 4. 7 H 2 O, NPK + CaO + MgO, and 3 foliar feeding treatments: O(H 2 O), Insol PK + 5 % urea solution, Ekosol U. The test plant was the oat cultivar ‘Kwant’. The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize in detail the response of oats to foliar feeding under the conditions of different soil fertilization with calcium and magnesium compounds. The experimental factors applied increased the yield parameters and differentiated the nutrient content in <b>oat</b> grain and <b>straw.</b> Soil fertilization had a greater effect on the quality parameters of primary yield than the foliar fertilizers used in the study. The best production and quality effects in growing oats were obtained after the application of MgSO 4 and magnesium lime. Foliar feeding also affected beneficially the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the yield. Among the fertilizers used, Insol PK showed a better effect than Ekosol U, in particular on the yield structure and the amino acid composition of proteins...|$|R
