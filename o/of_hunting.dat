5|$|Eschrichtiids {{have one}} living member: the grey whale. They are bottom feeders, mainly eating {{crustaceans}} and benthic invertebrates. They feed by turning {{on their sides}} and taking in water mixed with sediment, which is then expelled through the baleen, leaving their prey trapped inside. This is an efficient method <b>of</b> <b>hunting,</b> in which the whale has no major competitors.|$|E

5|$|The {{links between}} castles and the {{surrounding}} lands and estates was particularly important during this period. Many castles, both royal and baronial, had deer parks or chases attached to them for the purposes <b>of</b> <b>hunting.</b> These usually stretched away from the village or borough associated with the castle, but occasionally a castle {{was placed in the}} centre of a park, such as at Sandal.|$|E

Most of the lands of the New Forest are poor agricultural lands, and archaeological and geographic studies have shown that the New Forest was likely sparsely settled when it was turned into a royal forest. William was known for his love <b>of</b> <b>hunting,</b> and he introduced the forest law into areas of the country, regulating who could hunt and what could be hunted.|$|E
