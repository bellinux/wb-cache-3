Such an approach is in general not efficient and it shows poor significance. In this {{paper we propose a}} novel method, very effective for mix design, based on simulation of unsteady-flow of water through <b>open-graded</b> <b>mixture.</b> In particular we have modelled internal microstructures of an open-graded asphalt sample, positioning any aggregate particle and creating the bitumen film around each of them. The unsteady-flow of water inside the sample is simulated to evaluate the expected permeability for different specimens and compaction...|$|E
40|$|Very Thin Asphalt Overlay (VTAO) {{has been}} {{introduced}} {{as an alternative to}} traditional thick overlays, seal coats, and micro-surfacings. Nonetheless, there are some challenges that still remain regarding the application of VTAOs (such as mixture type, cohesiveness, wear resistance, cracking and durability), particularly in heavy traffic urban areas. Therefore, this paper presents an extensive comparative evaluation of the mechanical performance, durability and safety issues (cohesiveness, adhesiveness, ageing, cracking, plastic deformation, permeability, macrotexture, skid and wear resistance, and fuel resistance) of a VTAO (20 mm thick) and a high performance BBTM 11 B (35 mm thick), commonly used as an <b>open-graded</b> <b>mixture</b> for pavement overlays. The results demonstrated that VTAO is an appropriate material for urban pavements as it provides good durability and resistance to the propagation of defects. Nonetheless, further studies are required to improve its behavior under distresses related to plastic deformations and safety properties...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a study concerning the fatigue behaviour of asphalt mixtures with bitumen modified with high content of crumb rubber used in Portugal. For assessing the fatigue behaviour {{of this type}} of mixtures, four asphalt mixtures with high content of crumb rubber were used: two field bituminous mixtures – an open-graded and a gap-graded – both with granite aggregates; and two laboratory manufactured bituminous mixtures – an <b>open-graded</b> <b>mixture</b> with granite aggregates and a gap-graded mixture with crushed gravel aggregates. Since this type of mixtures are mainly applied in wearing courses, the effect of ageing in the fatigue behaviour of one of the studied asphalt rubber mixtures was also assessed through laboratory testing. The paper presents the main results achieved so far concerning the fatigue resistance and it could be concluded that all the materials have exhibited a good behaviour, in agreement with others previous studies. In the case of the aged gap-graded material, it was observed a slight reduction on the fatigue life comparatively to the un-aged one...|$|E
40|$|Road {{pavements}} {{are very}} important infrastructures for the Society, but they can cause serious environmental impacts during construction, operation and rehabilitation phases. Thus, {{it is essential to}} develop surface paving solutions that promote not only the durability but also a comfortable and safe use. In fact, this work aims to study the properties of new opengraded mixtures for surface layers produced with plastic wastes. First, HDPE and EVA wastes were used as bitumen modifiers, and then another plastic waste (PEX) replaced part of the aggregates. After studying the modified binders, the <b>open-graded</b> <b>mixtures</b> were designed, and then they were tested concerning their particle loss, rutting resistance, surface texture and damping effect. It was concluded that both ways of using the plastic wastes can improve the mechanical and functional properties of the <b>open-graded</b> <b>mixtures</b> related to the pavement performance.

40|$|Graduation date: 1994 Asphalt {{concrete}} pavement {{is subjected to}} several damaging actions from traffic loads, water (from precipitation and/or groundwater sources), and temperature. The durability of the asphalt-aggregate mixture, its ability to withstand these damaging actions for long periods, {{is a very important}} engineering property. While the durability of the asphalt-aggregates mixture depends on several factors such as the mixture's properties, construction methods, traffic loads and environmental conditions, they have to be evaluated to predict their field performance. Based on mixture evaluations, the mixtures that fail the test would have to be modified by additives or by changing the materials. The first objective of this thesis was to evaluate asphalt-aggregate mixtures for water damage using the Environmental Conditioning System (ECS), and rank the asphalt and aggregate types based on water sensitivity. The second objective was to relate the ECS ranking of the asphalt and aggregate types to Oregon State University (OSU) and University of Nottingham, UK (SWK/UN) wheel tracking test results, and to Net Adsorption Test (NAT) results. The third objective was to evaluate <b>open-graded</b> <b>mixtures</b> and rubber modified mixtures for water sensitivity using the ECS. The ECS test results indicate that performance ranking of mixtures by asphalt type or aggregate type alone cannot be made for the ECS test results due to the significant interaction between asphalt and aggregate. Water sensitivity in the ECS is significant for combinations of asphalt and aggregate. The ECS test results have shown that ECS performance ranking after one cycle is not statistically significant and does not correlate with ranking after three cycles. The results show that the ECS test program has similar aggregate rankings to those of the NAT and SWK/UN test program, while good agreement exists between SWK/UN wheel tracking results and the NAT test program results. However, poor agreement exists between the OSU wheel tracking results and those of the other two tests. Poor or very little agreement exists among the wheel tracking test results, ECS, and NAT test results in terms of asphalt type rankings. When considering the comparisons of materials ranking by different test procedures, one must {{keep in mind that the}} mechanisms leading to varying "performance" are not the same. The testing reported herein was aimed at measuring water sensitivity, but all the tests do not do so directly. The NAT procedure addresses only the potential for stripping (adhesion) and is not capable of evaluating cohesion loss. The other tests (ECS, OSU and SWK/UN wheel tracking) included all the mechanisms simultaneously, and these provided a gross effect without clearly separating the cause of failure in each case. <b>Open-graded</b> <b>mixtures</b> used by Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) performed well in the ECS in terms of water sensitivity. In the ECS evaluation, six mixtures passed the criteria of 75...|$|R
40|$|This {{laboratory}} {{investigation was}} conducted with the purposeof determining {{the applicability of the}} Hveem Stabilometer to the testing of <b>open-graded</b> bituminous <b>mixtures.</b> The study was divided into two major sections. The first of these investigated the validity of the Stabilometer displacement measurement when applied to open-graded specimens having large surface air voids. The second portion of the study had two specific purposes: (l) to investigate the stress-strain characteristics of open-graded mixturestested in the Hveem Stabilometer and (2) to determine whether surface voids on the ends of Stabilometer test specimens influenced Hveem stability values. To check the validity of the displacement measurement, Stabilometertests were, conducted over a wide range of displacement values forduplicate specimens molded from three different mixtures. Displacement readings were varied by altering the surfaces of test specimens andby adjusting the quantity of air inside the Stabilometer oil chamber. In studying the stress-strain characteristics of open-graded mixes, Stabilometer values and specimen deformation readings were obtained for two mixtures. The first of these open-type mixes was well-graded, but the second was essentially 2 ̆ 2 one-sized 2 ̆ 2 in gradation. Results of this investigation showed that the final displacement value, when substituted into the Hveem stability equation, did notcompensate for the variations in lateral pressure caused by large changes(one or more turns) in the final displacement measurement. Stress-strain relationships for the well-graded, open-type mixture indicated that the quantity of strain permitted a Stabilometer test specimen conformed closely with the amount of strain developed at the maximum shearing strength of a rational triaxial test specimen subjected to confining pressures similar to those present in a Stabilometer test. Strain measurements recorded for Stabilometer specimens of the one-sized mixture used in this study were much lower than those obtained at the peak value of shearing resistance for triaxial test specimens ofthe same mixture and for similar confining pressures. Surface air voids on the ends of Stabilometer test specimens hada small effect on test results. When these voids were filled, Hveem stability values were not significantly higher, but the reproducibility of test results was greatly improved by coating test specimens. To improve the consistency of Stabilometer test results obtainedfrom <b>open-graded</b> <b>mixtures,</b> certain modifications in the testing technique were suggested. These changes involved the filling of air voids on thesurface of test specimens and the admittance of an increased amount of air in the Stabilometer oil chamber during the calibration of the testing apparatu...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of {{different}} sizes of crumb rubber modifier (CRM) on the high temperature susceptibility of three gradations (AC- 10, AC- 20 and PA) of wearing course mixtures. A wet process and 10 % CRM by total weight of binders were used in these studies and the control variables for these studies included three CRMs of sizes 0. 15 mm, 0. 30 mm and 0. 60 mm. The evaluations were twofold. Firstly, {{a comparison of the}} properties of those modified and unmodified binders at a wide range of testing temperatures and ageing conditions was conducted. Secondary, a comparison of the rutting resistance of the CRM and conventional mixtures was made. The results show that all the CRMs have overall contributed to better performance of both binders and mixtures at high temperatures. In addition, among these three CRM sizes, mixtures modified with 0. 15 mm CRM exhibited the best effect on the dense-graded mixture (AC- 10 and AC- 20) whereas mixtures modified with 0. 60 mm CRM exhibited the best effect on the <b>open-graded</b> <b>mixture</b> of porous asphalt (PA).

40|$|The load {{transfer}} capacity of pavements is {{to a great}} extend influenced by aggregates. About 85 % of the total volume of hot mix asphalt (HMA) mixtures consists of aggregates; thus, they are greatly influenced by aggregate properties like angularity (shape), roughness (texture), and gradation. Aggregate gradation controls the structure of voids. Current specifications for aggregate properties in HMA pavements require the aggregate blend to fall within a specified range of gradation values. Although the abovementioned requirement has ensured the construction of high quality HMA pavements, the properties are largely empirical {{and they are not}} based on performance-related tests. Marshall Stability is in principle the resistance to plastic flow of cylindrical specimens of a bituminous mixture loaded on the lateral surface. It is the load carrying capacity of the mix at 60 oC. Aggregates with different gradations from the broader area of Xanthi, Northern Greece, have been used to prepare specimens for stability testing of hot asphalt mixtures in the laboratory. The research focused on the evaluation of the influence of aggregates in the overall stability characteristics of the mixtures. The maximum stability value has been obtained with an <b>open-graded</b> <b>mixture</b> having 5 % asphalt and aggregate size 2. 36 mm. However, the stability of the dense graded mixture is higher than this maximum value...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was first to present the {{laboratory}} mix design results for porous asphalt concrete (PAC) mixtures blended with high-viscosity-graded cement (AR- 80) and asphalt rubber (AR). In addition, the master curves of dynamic modulus were determined for both the unconfined and confined conditions to evaluate the rutting behavior of both PAC mixtures. The mix design results showed that the PAC <b>open-graded</b> <b>mixture</b> consisted of a relatively large percentage of coarse aggregate, with less than 15 % of the material passing through a 2. 36 -mm (No. 8) sieve, which created a sufficient space for water drainage. The target air voids of approximately 20 %, as well as the coefficient of permeability greater than 10 2 cm=s, were established. Comparing the master curves of dynamic modulus between these two types of PAC mixtures indicated that the asphalt-rubber mixtures exhibited higher dynamic modulus at longer reduced times for both the unconfined and confined conditions. The experimental results of repeated triaxial-loaded and wheel tracking permanent deformation tests confirmed that the asphalt-rubber mixtures have superior performance against rutting. Furthermore, the high void of both PAC mixtures illustrated the validity of the principles of time-temperature superposition in the large strain of the viscoplastic stage during repeated triaxial-loaded permanent deformation tests...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an innovative methodology for {{the rehabilitation of}} concrete slabs of airports pavements. The rehabilitation technique {{is based on the}} use of a geocomposite and of an overlay made of a special <b>open-graded</b> bituminous <b>mixture</b> filled with mortar. The research consisted of the development of a Finite Element Model able to analyze the response of the rehabilitation system over the cracked slabs. The technique was then tested through two fullscale tests. The first field test section was aimed at defining the best construction procedure. The second one was carried out in airport to directly evaluate the response under traffic. Tests were performed to quantify the increase of the structural and functional performance of the pavement after the rehabilitation. Finally, the methodology was applied in a real case, on a wide scale (about 120000 m 2) at two Italian airports...|$|R
40|$|Permeable Friction Courses (PFC) are <b>open-graded</b> {{bituminous}} <b>mixtures</b> {{placed over}} an impervious base. The interconnected air voids allow rainwater to drain into the pavement thus providing a safer driving surface in wet weather {{and a filter}} for highway runoff. This report summarizes {{the current state of}} the practice related to the hydraulic properties, water quality benefits, and maintenance of PFC based on literature from around the world. Porous pavements reduce pollutant concentrations in the highway runoff during the functional service life of the pavement, which ultimately results in the clogging of the pavement. This material accumulating in the pores was found to have high concentrations of pollutants, such as heavy metals. Pavement cleaning machines used in Europe to remove accumulated pollutants are described and usually found to maintain the function of the pavements. Existing research also includes measurements of hydraulic conductivity over time and from different pavements. In winter conditions, more maintenance is required for PFCs than for conventional pavements since the air voids change with ambient air temperature casing the PFC to freeze faster than conventional pavement. Other beneficial properties of PFCs, such as the friction coefficient and noise reduction ability, are also described...|$|R
40|$|This article {{concerns}} {{road safety}} in tunnels and focuses {{specifically on the}} behaviour of pavements during accidental fires. Their role is investigated through a comparative laboratory investigation of materials used worldwide: hot mix asphalts (HMAs) and Portland cement concrete (PCC). In addition, the investigation also considers a relatively new material made of an <b>open-grade</b> bituminous <b>mixture</b> filled with cement mortar, in literature known as grouted macadam (GM). The comparison is carried out by developing an experimental plan with four main goals: assessment {{of the effect of}} fire exposure, evaluation of the effect of exposure to high temperatures, measurement of the decay of mechanical characteristics as a result of fire and exposure to high temperatures, and assessment of the types and concentration of smoke emitted during fire exposure. Results from the investigation led to the conclusion that HMA is the least suitable material for tunnel applications as it showed the worst performance in all four test categories. PCC shows the best performance in the tunnel-fire scenario and GM may also be considered suitable for tunnel-pavement application as it showed a similar or even better performance compared to PCC...|$|R
40|$|Permeability of open-graded asphalt mixes {{is defined}} as the ability to {{transmit}} fluids through the voids. The infiltration of water affects the durability and safety of pavement systems. Traditionally, an empirical approach, based on laboratory tests or on field measurements, is used to evaluate hydraulic permeability. In general, such an approach allows the ex post calculation of the drainage capability of the open-graded pavement. In order to evaluate the hydraulic permeability during the phase of mix design, in this paper a novel method is proposed, based on simulation of unsteady flow of water through <b>open-graded</b> <b>mixture.</b> In particular, a real sample of asphalt mix is simulated {{in the shape of a}} Marshall test sample. It is composed of a set of particles, selected according to the real grading, positioned in the space domain following the random sequence adsorption approach (RSA) and covered by a film of bitumen. The flow of water through the synthetical sample is simulated through the lattice Boltzmann method. In this method, the particles of water propagate and collide while moving on a lattice, obtained by discretizing the physical space. This lattice is formed by equidistant nodes, where each node corresponds to a void or to a solid. The velocity of the particles depends on a set of microscopic velocity vectors. Simulation results allow prediction of the permeability of open-graded pavement through a theoretical calculation based on the Kozeny-Carman equation. The model is validated using experimental test...|$|E
