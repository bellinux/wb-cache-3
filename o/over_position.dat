5|$|In captive Egyptian fruit bats, 70% of the {{directed}} calls {{could be}} identified as to which bat made it, and 60% could be categorised into four contexts: squabbling over food, jostling <b>over</b> <b>position</b> in their sleeping cluster, protesting over mating attempts and arguing when perched {{in close proximity to}} each other. The animals made slightly different sounds when communicating with different individuals, especially one of the opposite sex. Male hammerheaded bats produce deep, resonating, monotonous calls to attract females. Bats in flight make vocal signal for traffic control. Individual greater bulldog bats honk when {{on a collision course with}} each other.|$|E

[...] On the day of her last column in 2002, Landers wrote, [...] "P.S. The toilet paper hangs over the top." [...] Her published commentary on the issue has even continued after her death. 2005 saw the premiere of a one-woman play written by David Rambo: a character study of Ann Landers titled The Lady with All the Answers. Toilet paper comes up once again, and the actress surveys the audience for their opinions.|$|E

50|$|The local {{acceleration}} (a) {{can also}} {{be thought of as}} the “unsteady term” as this describes some change in velocity over time. The convective acceleration (b) is an acceleration caused by some change in velocity <b>over</b> <b>position,</b> for example the speeding up or slowing down of a fluid entering a constriction or an opening, respectively.
