40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} a short {{overview}} on stochastic modeling <b>of</b> <b>uncertainties.</b> We introduce the types <b>of</b> <b>uncertainties,</b> the variability <b>of</b> real systems, the types of probabilistic approaches, the representations for the stochastic models <b>of</b> <b>uncertainties,</b> the construction <b>of</b> the stochastic models using the maximum entropy principle, the propagation <b>of</b> <b>uncertainties,</b> the methods to solve the stochastic dynamical equations, {{the identification of the}} prior and the posterior stochastic models, the robust updating of the computational models and the robust design with uncertain computational models. We present recent theoretical advances in this field concerning the parametric and the nonparametric probabilistic approaches <b>of</b> <b>uncertainties</b> in computational structural dynamics for the construction of the prior stochastic models <b>of</b> both the <b>uncertainties</b> on the computational model parameters and on the modeling uncertainties, and for their identification with experimental data.

The parameters of the prior probability model <b>of</b> <b>uncertainties</b> are separately identified for each type <b>of</b> <b>uncertainties,</b> yielding an optimal prior probability model. The optimal prior stochastic computational model allows a robust analysis for the family of structures to be carried out...|$|R

5|$|By {{the early}} morning hours of August4, the NHC {{upgraded}} Tropical Depression Eight-E to Tropical Storm Felicia, the seventh named storm of the season. Located within an area of low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures, averaging between 28 and 29°C (82 and 84°F), the storm quickly developed, with deep convection persisting around the center of circulation. These conditions were anticipated to persist for at least three days; however, there was an increased amount <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty</b> due to possible interaction with Tropical Storm Enrique. Several hours later, the storm began to undergo rapid intensification, following the formation of an eye. Around 2:00pm PDT (2100UTC), Felicia intensified into a hurricane.|$|E

The National Hurricane Center also briefly issued a hurricane watch for the coastline. On September 17, 26hours before Isabel made landfall, the watches were changed to tropical storm warnings. While over the western Atlantic Ocean as a Category 5 hurricane, forecasters predicted Isabel would move northwestward and within five days be at a position 155miles (250km) south-southeast of Lewes as a 115mph (185km/h) major hurricane.

Implosion-type bombs were determined to be significantly more efficient in terms of explosive yield per unit mass of fissile material in the bomb, because compressed fissile materials react more rapidly and therefore more completely. It was decided that the plutonium gun would receive {{the bulk of the}} research effort, since it was the project with the least amount <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty</b> involved.

Hydrophilous tall herb fringe community with Petasites hybridus, at the limit of its range, is also exceptional. The herbaceous fringe with red campion (Silene dioica) et wood forget-me-not (Myosotis sylvatica) (Sileno dioicae - Myosotidetum sylvaticae) is very rare in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais.

5|$|Thus, {{engineer}} and physicist Hannes Alfvén identified two fundamental prerequisites for effective management of high-level radioactive waste: (1) stable geological formations, and (2) stable human institutions {{over hundreds of}} thousands of years. As Alfvén suggests, no known human civilization has ever endured for so long, and no geologic formation of adequate size for a permanent radioactive waste repository has yet been discovered that has been stable for so long a period. Nevertheless, avoiding confronting the risks associated with managing radioactive wastes may create countervailing risks of greater magnitude. Radioactive waste management is an example of policy analysis that requires special attention to ethical concerns, examined in the light <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty</b> and futurity: consideration of 'the impacts of practices and technologies on future generations'.|$|E
