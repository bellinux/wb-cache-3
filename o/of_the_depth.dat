5|$|Heading {{into the}} game against Mike Bellotti's Oregon Ducks, Oklahoma {{defensive}} coordinator Brent Venables made some major changes to the defensive depth chart after giving up four long running plays {{through the heart of}} the defensive line against Washington. The starters at defensive tackle, cornerback, and strong safety were all demoted, opening opportunities for some freshmen to step up. D.J. Wolfe was replaced by Marcus Walker at cornerback while senior Jason Carter started in place of Keenan Clayton at strong safety. Carter replaced Clayton in the game against Washington after a missed tackle by the freshman led to a Husky touchdown on their first offensive play. Even though all four players at defensive tackle had almost the same number of plays, Steven Coleman was moved off the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> chart as well.|$|E
5|$|Darwin's {{interest}} on the biology of reef organisms was focussed on aspects related to his geological idea of subsidence; in particular, {{he was looking for}} confirmation that the reef building organisms could only live at shallow depths. FitzRoy's soundings at the Keeling Islands gave a depth limit for live coral of about 20fathoms (37m), and taking into account numerous observations by others, Darwin worked with a probable limit of 30fathoms (55m). Modern findings suggest a limit of around 100m, still a small fraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> of the ocean floor at 3000–5000m. Darwin recognised the importance of red algae, and he reviewed other organisms that could have helped to build the reefs. He thought they lived at similarly shallow depths, but banks formed at greater depths were found in the 1880s. Darwin reviewed the distribution of different species of coral across a reef. He thought that the seaward reefs most exposed to wind and waves were formed by massive corals and red algae; this would be the most active area of reef growth and so would cause a tendency for reefs to grow outwards once they reach sea level. He believed that higher temperatures and the calmer water of the lagoons favoured the greatest coral diversity. These ecological ideas are still current, and research on the details continues.|$|E

25|$|The key {{innovation}} that made ocean-going steamers viable was {{the change from}} the paddle-wheel to the screw-propeller as the mechanism of propulsion.

25|$|In Genasauria, the mandibular {{symphysis}} {{is shaped}} like a spout and forms at an acute angle. The mandibular symphysis {{is the point of}} fusion between the two lateral dentary bones. The mandible of Genasauria is also characterized by the possession of a coronoid process that is longer than 50 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> of the midlength of the dentary. The coronoid process is a thin anterior projection of bone from the dentary, which serves as a site for the attachment of muscles that aid in chewing behavior.|$|E
25|$|Suddenly {{there was}} a series of ear-splitting explosions, as Fame dropped a pattern of 10 depth charges. The lights in U-353 went out and water entered forward and aft through the {{hydrophone}} shafts. The electric motors stopped working, all but one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> gauges broke, and the aft hydroplanes were put out of action. U-353 went deeper, almost out of control as water poured in through the stern torpedo tube causing her to lose trim. The U-boat blew her tanks and surfaced, and the captain ordered the crew to prepare to abandon ship.|$|E

25|$|Lake {{freeze-up}} {{depends on}} the heat storage in the lake and therefore on its depth, the rate and temperature of any inflow, and water-air energy fluxes. Information on lake depth is often unavailable, although some indication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> of shallow lakes in the Arctic {{can be obtained from}} airborne radar imagery during late winter (Sellman et al. 1975) and spaceborne optical imagery during summer (Duguay and Lafleur 1997). The timing of breakup is modified by snow depth on the ice as well as by ice thickness and freshwater inflow.|$|E
25|$|The depth map, {{along with}} other information, can then be used to {{generate}} 3D parallax effects, to apply filters individually to {{different parts of the}} image, such as blurring the background to focus on an object in the foreground, or to copy and paste an object from one photo into another, similar to those available with a Lytro camera. In mid-April, HTC released a software development kit that allows other apps to take advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> mapping system, and stated that the SDK will be used by the camera app on the Google Play edition.|$|E
25|$|Another more {{plausible}} theory from foreign experts, also favored by Pakistan, {{is that the}} explosive shock waves from one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> charges set off the torpedoes and mines (some of {{which may have been}} armed for laying) stored aboard the submarine. The Navy NHQ counter-argued: Ghazi itself may have inadvertently passed over the mines during the mine laying operations; patrolling Indian vessels or Indian depth charges might also have tripped the count mechanism of one or more mines. Credibility is added to this story by the later discovery made by Indian Coast Guard divers in 2003, that the damaged parts of the submarine had been blown inside out.|$|E

25|$|None {{of these}} systems are perfect. For example, they are {{unreliable}} at extremes of age (e.g. neonates, infants or the very elderly). Secondly, certain agents, such as nitrous oxide, may produce anesthesia without reducing the value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> monitor. This is because the molecular action of these agents (NMDA receptor antagonists) {{differs from that of}} more conventional agents, and they suppress cortical EEG activity less. Thirdly, they are prone to interference from other biological potentials (such as EMG), or external electrical signals (such as electrosurgery). This means that the technology that will reliably monitor depth of anesthesia for every patient and every anesthetic does not yet exist.|$|E
25|$|Marr's 2.5D sketch {{assumes that}} a depth map is constructed, {{and that this}} map {{is the basis of}} 3D shape perception. However, both {{stereoscopic}} and pictorial perception, as well as monocular viewing, make clear that the perception of 3D shape precedes, and does not rely on, the perception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> of points. It is not clear how a preliminary depth map could, in principle, be constructed, nor how this would address the question of figure-ground organization, or grouping. The role of perceptual organizing constraints, overlooked by Marr, in the production of 3D shape percepts from binocularly-viewed 3D objects has been demonstrated empirically for the case of 3D wire objects, e.g. For a more detailed discussion, see Pizlo (2008).|$|E
25|$|When she was {{launched}} in 1942, the ship's main armament consisted of six 4.7-inch Mark XII guns sited in three twin turrets. This was supplemented by two 4-inch Mark XVI* guns in a single twin turret, a quad-barrelled 2-pounder Mark VIII pom pom, six single 20 mm Oerlikons, a quadruple 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tube set, and a rail to launch depth charges. During 1945, the six Oerlikons were replaced with six 40 mm Bofors guns, and two depth charge throwers were added. In 1949, half of the torpedo payload and most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> charge payload was removed, {{to allow for the}} installation of a new motor cutter. In 1952, the aftmost 4.7-inch turret was replaced by a Squid anti-submarine mortar.|$|E
