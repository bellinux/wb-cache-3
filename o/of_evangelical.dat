5|$|Mainstream Christianity has {{typically}} {{rejected the}} ideas of the New Age. Most published criticism of the New Age has been produced by Christians, particularly those on the religion's fundamentalist wing. In the United States, the New Age became a major concern <b>of</b> <b>evangelical</b> Christian groups in the 1980s, an attitude that came to influence British evangelical groups. During that decade, evangelical writers such as Constance Cumbey, Dave Hunt, Gary North, and Douglas Groothuis published books criticising the New Age from their Christian perspective; a number of them have been characterised as propagating conspiracy theories regarding the origin and purpose of the movement. The most successful such publication however was Frank E. Peretti's 1986 novel This Present Darkness, which sold over a million copies; it depicted the New Age as being in league with feminism and secular education as part of a conspiracy to overthrow Christianity.|$|E
5|$|Upon its {{establishment}} in 1871, Germany was about two-thirds Protestant and one-third Roman Catholic, with a notable Jewish minority. Other faiths {{existed in the}} state, but never achieved a demographic significance and cultural impact of these three confessions. Germany lost nearly all of its Jewish minority during the Holocaust. Religious makeup changed gradually in the decades following 1945, with West Germany becoming more religiously diversified through immigration and East Germany becoming overwhelmingly irreligious through state policies. It continues to diversify after the German reunification in 1990, with an accompanying substantial decline in religiosity throughout all of Germany and a contrasting increase <b>of</b> <b>Evangelical</b> Protestants and Muslims.|$|E
5|$|When Reid took office, Alberta was {{experiencing}} the Great Depression. Reid took measures to ease Albertans' suffering, but believed that inducing a full economic recovery {{was beyond the}} capacity of the provincial government. In this climate, Alberta voters were attracted to the economic theories <b>of</b> <b>evangelical</b> preacher William Aberhart, who advocated a version of social credit. Despite Reid's claims that Aberhart's proposals were economically and constitutionally unfeasible, Social Credit routed the UFA in the 1935 election; Reid's party did not retain a single seat. Reid lived forty-five years after his defeat, but these years were spent in obscurity; he never returned to political life.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-seventeenth century, the {{extension}} of toleration to sectaries under the Commonwealth brought a number of independent movements to Scotland. The only one not to collapse after {{the withdrawal of the}} army at the Restoration in 1660 were the Quakers. Their numbers remained small in the eighteenth century and they were largely confined to the large cities and the northwest. Baptist churches had been founded in several towns during the Commonwealth, largely consisting of English soldiers and their families. They lapsed when the English occupation ended and the first Scottish Baptist church is usually thought to be founded at Keiss in 1750 by William Sinclair. Occasionally individual Presbyterian ministers led their congregations out of existing churches and into independent churches, leading to the establishment of isolated churches for groups like the Unitarians. The series <b>of</b> <b>evangelical</b> enterprises undertaken by the brothers James and Robert Haldane in the period 1796–1800, which led to the foundation of Sunday schools, day schools and tabernacles in parts of the Lowlands, Highlands and Islands, helped strengthen the Baptist and Congregational churches when the brothers later embraced adult Baptism and the congregations divided between the two traditions.|$|E
5|$|Monroe's early {{childhood}} was stable and happy. While Gladys was mentally and financially unprepared for a child, {{she was able}} to place Monroe with foster parents Albert and Ida Bolender in the rural town of Hawthorne soon after the birth. They raised their foster children according to the principles <b>of</b> <b>evangelical</b> Christianity. At first, Gladys lived with the Bolenders and commuted to work in Los Angeles, until longer work shifts forced her to move back to the city in early 1927. She then began visiting her daughter on weekends, often taking her to the cinema and to sightsee in Los Angeles. Although the Bolenders wanted to adopt Monroe, by the summer of 1933, Gladys felt stable enough for Monroe to move in with her and bought a small house in Hollywood. They shared it with lodgers, actors George and Maude Atkinson and their daughter, Nellie. Some months later, in January 1934, Gladys had a mental breakdown and was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. After several months in a rest home, she was committed to the Metropolitan State Hospital. She spent {{the rest of her life}} in and out of hospitals, and was rarely in contact with Monroe.|$|E
5|$|The {{previous}} North American {{calendar of}} the ELCA {{was different from}} its European counterparts in {{that it does not}} give equal weight (and sometimes gives no mention) to persons who may be commemorated in Scandinavian regions. One example would be the absence of St. Lucia on December 13, although she enjoys particular popularity in Sweden. But Lutheran calendars also differ amongst one another in North America, with some individuals commemorated on multiple calendars but on different days (e.g., St. Bernard of Clairvaux on August 19 in the LCMS and August 20 in the ELCA) or individuals commemorated on one calendar and not the other (e.g., Martin Luther King, Jr. on January 15 for the ELCA and C. F. W. Walther on May 7 for the LCMS); with the 2006 publication <b>of</b> <b>Evangelical</b> Lutheran Worship (ELW) as a replacement to the Lutheran Book of Worship (LBW), some of these deficiencies in the ELCA calendar have been corrected. Within the ELCA, This Far by Faith and Libro de Liturgia y Cantico both prescribe calendars with additional commemorations specific to the ethnic communities they were intended to be used in (African Americans and Latinos respectively). The Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod has a different, somewhat minimized calendar when compared the LCMS and especially the ELCA.|$|E

25|$|Before World War II, {{there were}} fewer Protestants in the Soviet Union than adherents of other faiths, but they showed {{remarkable}} growth since then.

In 1804, the British and Foreign Bible Society was founded to provide Bibles in different languages to accompany the missionary work.|$|E
