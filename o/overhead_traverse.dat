40|$|Metadata {{management}} in large distributed systems {{is a critical}} aspect of overall system performance. Directory subtree partitioning and pure hashing are two common techniques used for metadata management. Neither of these techniques can support large systems with high con-current accesses due to the conflicting need for both load balancing and directory update efficiency. We present a flexible approach that addresses {{the problems of the}} existing techniques. The approach, called Lazy Hybrid Hashed Hierarchical directory management, takes advan-tage of the load balancing and other performance bene-fits of hashing, while maintaining a hierarchical directory structure and metadata logging to support lazy metadata relocation and updates. A dual-entry Access Control List provides direct permission calculation to the target file, avoiding the <b>overhead</b> of <b>traversing</b> the pathname for per-mission check. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMobile ad hoc {{network is}} a self {{organized}} & dynamic multi hop wireless network comprised of mobile nodes that {{communicate with each}} other without any fixed infrastructure. Different solution proposed for scaling down the large size of networks, one of the most intrinsic approaches is clustering techniques which evolved an important role in mobile ad hoc network (MANETs). Cluster based routing protocols are used to reduce the routing overload and improves the system performance in the transmission delay and throughput. In this paper we have presented a brief review of state of the art scenario of routing protocols and present a new weight based hierarchical clustering algorithm for MANETs that leads to cluster formation. In our proposed approach the cluster head selection technique is based on combined weight metric that takes into account like the node degree, transmission range and mobility of the nodes. This new algorithm takes into consideration to reduce routing <b>overhead</b> and <b>traverse</b> preferred distance through selected route...|$|R

Using a GPS device, geographical information {{is considered to}} select a short geographical path while ensuring the maximum covered distance and the minimum handovers number. An efficient algorithm is derived to tackle the problem in polynomial time. Our solution is optimal and well suited to all possible scenarios including low and high hotspots density. By comparing our algorithm with some common practices, we minimize significantly the handovers number and decrease the wireless uncovered distance, with a negligible <b>overhead</b> in the <b>traversed</b> distanc...|$|R
50|$|In 1953, {{the first}} 345 kV line {{was put into}} service by American Electric Power in the United States. In Germany in 1957 the first 380 kV {{overhead}} power line was commissioned (between the transformer station and Rommerskirchen). In the same year the <b>overhead</b> line <b>traversing</b> of the Strait of Messina went into service in Italy, whose pylons served the Elbe crossing 1. This {{was used as the}} model for the building of the Elbe crossing 2 {{in the second half of}} the 1970s which saw the construction of the highest overhead line pylons of the world. Earlier, in 1952, the first 380 kV line was put into service in Sweden, in 1000 km (625 miles) between the more populated areas in the south and the largest hydroelectric power stations in the north.Starting from 1967 in Russia, and also in the USA and Canada, overhead lines for voltage of 765 kV were built. In 1982 overhead power lines were built in Soviet Union between Elektrostal and the power station at Ekibastuz, this was a three-phase alternating current line at 1150 kV (Powerline Ekibastuz-Kokshetau). In 1999, in Japan the first powerline designed for 1000 kV with 2 circuits were built, the Kita-Iwaki Powerline. In 2003 the building of the highest overhead line commenced in China, the Yangtze River Crossing.|$|R
40|$|A cluster-based {{architecture}} with a proxy {{and a few}} back-end servers is {{a popular}} solution to face the ever increasing demand for data-intensive services. Stateof-the-art Cluster-based servers employ a proxy {{that is responsible for}} distributing incoming requests to the back-end server {{in a manner that is}} transparent to clients. The back-end servers send the response to the proxy, which then forwards it to the client. The overhead of processing each packet at the proxy affects the response time adversely. Moreover, since the entire traffic from all the servers has to pass through the proxy, it often becomes the bottleneck. In this paper, we propose an architecture for cluster servers which provides a generic solution for the above mentioned problems. It is achieved by sending the response from the back-end server directly to the client, bypassing the proxy altogether. Thus, we eliminate the <b>overhead</b> of <b>traversing</b> the network stack at proxy which involves costly kernel-user context switches and data copies between the kernel and user space buffers. The technique used to achieve this is called Connection Handoff. The paper also argues the aptness of SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) as the transport layer protocol for our clusters. SCTP is similar to TCP but has additional features like multistreaming, multihoming, immunity to DoS attacks, prevention of Head of Line Blocking etc. These features make it a better choice as the transport layer protocol for our project. Using the technique of SCTP handoff along with features like Load balancers and Content-Aware-Dispatcher, we aim at improving user response times and overall throughput rates for a variety of data-intensive services, improving the scalability and robustness of the cluster servers at the same time. 1...|$|R
5000|$|... 2001 {{was to be}} {{the year}} of three new roller coasters, but only one {{actually}} opened on time: Goliath Jr., a steel kiddie coaster. The other two, Déjà Vu and X (now X²), had mechanical problems. Déjà Vu opened late in 2001 and X opened early in 2002. Déjà Vu was designed by Vekoma and is a Giant Inverted Boomerang coaster (GIB), a variant of their popular Boomerang design. It is an inverted coaster with coaches suspended beneath an <b>overhead</b> track that <b>traverses</b> an open-circuit track forward and in reverse and features two completely vertical drops and three inversions. It opened late in 2001, but suffered a lot of downtime. X was designed by Arrow Dynamics, as the world's first [...] "fourth-dimensional" [...] roller coaster. It is the only one in North America where riders experience going 360 degrees in their seats. Each seat lies on a separate axis from the track. This coaster managed to open briefly on January 7, 2002, only to close due to more technical problems. It reopened late in August of that year. The ride closed for a major refurbishment and re-theme in 2008 where X transformed into X2.|$|R
5000|$|Because of the {{proximity}} of Emden, Wilhelmshaven, Oldenburg, and Bremen, Wiesmoor had lain under major air corridors used by the RAF and their Commonwealth allies and others at night, and the USAAF during the day. There were, weather permitting, very frequent nighttime and daylight air raids <b>traversing</b> <b>overhead.</b> At night, the RAF and others (including Poles, Czechs, Norwegians, Dutch, and South Africans) often enough missed their targets with bundled incendiary and fragmentation bombs which inadvertently hit the area around Wiesmoor and embedded themselves in the peat bogs. Eugeniusz remembered that prisoners caught stealing food were condemned to the [...] "disposal" [...] of these unexploded bombs (UXBs), all too often with tragic results {{of which he was}} a witness from a distance. Other [...] "violations" [...] were dealt with by public hangings, or outright shooting of the prisoner by a guard or guards. There were, at least, three Allied plane crashes in the area - a bomber and two fighters which he remembered. One of the downed fighters was a P-51 Mustang of the famed Tuskegee Airmen ("Red Tails"). The pilot successfully bailed out and was rescued by one of his squadron-mates who landed to allow his buddy to climb behind him into the cockpit while part of the squadron covered them from above. The camp at Wiesmoor was liberated on the morning of 5 May 1945 by forward units of the 1st Polish Armored Division commanded by Major General Stanisaw Maczek. Two days later, the Division received the surrender of the command of the Kriegsmarine's base at Wilhelmshaven where most of Germany's U-boots were moored.|$|R
