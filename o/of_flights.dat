40|$|Abstract- Flight {{delay is}} a public problem in civil {{aviation}} industry, and resolving the disputes arising from flight delay has been {{beyond the control of}} airlines. To solve the problem, it needs the government and the private sector to work together. In this paper, by analyzing the theory of public issues, we proposed to set sectoral governance institutions <b>of</b> <b>flight</b> delays and introduce the third party governance corporation <b>of</b> <b>flight</b> delays. As complementary measures of the proposed ideas, we also designed the process and mechanism of economic compensation reserve fund <b>of</b> <b>flight</b> delays.

The storm caused the Kaohsiung seaport in southern Taiwan to close, thus delaying shipments from nearby chemical plants. Many boats rode out the storm at port. Portions of the Kaohsiung Mass Rapid Transit system suspended their service, and the Maokong Gondola was shut down during the storm.|$|E

5|$|As the new {{residential}} area suffered from aircraft noise, residents {{joined in the}} demand that the airport be relocated. Despite this, the number <b>of</b> <b>flights</b> to the airport increased as the newly formed Israel Airports Authority strived to reduce congestion at Ben Gurion Airport by shifting all domestic turbo-prop flights to Sde Dov. Once again, the only feasible alternative proposed at this point was to build a runway in the sea and again, {{the high cost of}} this project meant that it never happened. This was a large issue in the area during the whole of the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Biman's {{handling}} of Hajj flights {{has also been}} beset with troubles. In 2005, the State Minister for Civil Aviation and Tourism resigned after complaints that he set fares too high. In 2006, Biman took the unprecedented step of removing the business–class seats from its dedicated Hajj flights to accommodate more economy-class passengers. Procedural irregularities by the Hajj agencies delayed the confirmation of pilgrims' visas, and Biman had to cancel 19 flights owing to lack of sufficient passengers.

5|$|Color Air {{started with}} flights from Gardermoen on 1 August, {{two months before}} the airport opened. Gardermoen was taken into use on 8 October by SAS and Braathens.

The number of daily trips from Oslo for SAS increased from 59 to over 80. In total, the three companies increased their daily round trip from 138 to 200, and the daily seat capacity from 18,000 to 26,000. Ålesund had the largest increase, from seven daily round trips with only Braathens, to seventeen offered by all three companies.|$|E

5|$|SAS Commuter was {{established}} in 1988 and started operations in Northern Norway in May 1990, making Alta its central hub for Finnmark. This involved a change to the operations so that all DC-9 services from Alta to Oslo were flown non-stop. Conversely, all services to airports in Northern Norway were flown using the smaller Fokker 50. Thus SAS was able to reduce costs by no longer operating local routes with the DC-9/MD-80 and instead increased the number <b>of</b> <b>flights.</b> The change made Alta the only airport in Finnmark with direct services to Oslo. From 1989 to 1990, the number of annual aircraft movements at Alta hiked from 7,711 to 10,035.|$|E

SAS was able to reduce costs by no longer operating local routes with the DC-9 and instead increased the number <b>of</b> <b>flights.</b> The new system was met with massive opposition in Kirkenes. Emergency meetings were being held between SAS Commuter and the ministry by June 1990 because of low regularity and many cancellations.

5|$|With the {{delivery}} of the Boeing 737-200s, Braathens SAFE started using these aircraft on the long-haul charter flights. By 1977, there were nine international charter airlines competing with Braathens SAFE: Aviaco, Britannia Airways, Dan-Air, Linjeflyg, Maersk Air, Scanair (owned by SAS), Spantax, Sterling and Transair. In 1976, good exchange rates gave a peak <b>of</b> <b>flights</b> to London, with eleven weekly flights across the North Sea. Braathens SAFE also started flying for Vingresor.
