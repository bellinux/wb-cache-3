Then scenes of Rihanna walking {{on the beach and}} Rihanna curling up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> are shown. This is followed by her own and her partner holding each other closely in bed, sitting on different sides of a large bed, and other scenes featuring Rihanna singing through sheer curtains and drapery. In the video there are also black-white scenes showing Rihanna touching to a stone wall.|$|E
5|$|During his youth, Olajuwon was {{a soccer}} goalkeeper, which helped {{give him the}} {{footwork}} and agility to balance his size and strength in basketball, and also contributed to his shot-blocking ability. Olajuwon did not play basketball {{until the age of}} 17, when he entered a local tournament. It has been said that a coach in Nigeria once asked him to dunk and demonstrated while standing on a chair. Olajuwon then tried to stand <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> himself. When redirected by staff not to use the chair, Hakeem could initially not dunk the basketball.|$|E

The next day, Principal Skinner is missing and {{is presumed to}} have been murdered. Bart has a nightmare of Principal Skinner's ghost and his own execution <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair.</b> He rushes to confront Fat Tony at the bar. When the police burst in, Fat Tony blames Principal Skinner's disappearance on Bart, who is put on trial. During the trial, Fat Tony, Legs, and Louie lie to the court, saying that Bart is Principal Skinner's murderer {{and the leader of}} the Springfield Mafia.|$|E

5|$|As the {{breakdown}} happens, the soldiers bind her <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> but she laughs, kicks and spits on them. Midst the aggressive fighting, the white Madonna takes a speargun and shoots the black Madonna {{squarely on the}} chest. The black Madonna falls down and concurrently a soldier pulls the switch on the electric chair. They laugh loudly thinking Madonna to be burnt but as the smoke clears, they see that no remnants are to be found. They rush to inspect the chair closely and notice three letters (לאו) being burnt in the chair. They scratch their head and see {{a vision of a}} bearded man laughing at them. Madonna is shown running from the torture chamber and opens the door, as the video ends with the gun barrel sequence.|$|E
5|$|The pseudo-tracking shot {{in which}} the camera appears to {{approach}} the Man in the Moon was accomplished using an effect Méliès had invented the previous year for the film The Man with the Rubber Head. Rather than attempting to move his weighty camera toward an actor, he set a pulley-operated chair upon a rail-fitted ramp, placed the actor (covered up to the neck in black velvet) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair,</b> and pulled him toward the camera. In addition to its technical practicality, this technique also allowed Méliès to control {{the placement of the}} face within the frame to a much greater degree of specificity than moving his camera allowed. A substitution splice allowed a model capsule to suddenly appear {{in the eye of the}} actor playing the Moon, completing the shot. Another notable sequence in the film, the plunge of the capsule into real ocean waves filmed on location, was created through multiple exposure, with a shot of the capsule falling in front of a black background superimposed upon the footage of the ocean. The shot is followed by an underwater glimpse of the capsule floating back to the surface, created by combining a moving cardboard cutout of the capsule with an aquarium containing tadpoles and air jets. The descent of the rocket from the Moon was covered in four shots, taking up about twenty seconds of film time.|$|E

25|$|Although {{he was not}} {{eager to}} cling to his {{position}} in government, Buenaventura nonetheless stated that the stability of a fixed six-year term for a central bank governor {{was more important than}} the actual person sitting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair.</b> Philippine governance was already under attack from the international community; it was seen not merely as unstable, but downright whimsical, depending on the mood of whoever was wielding the power at any given moment. Buenaventura thus refused to resign, even as a courtesy to the new president. It was at this time that he made public his second career: counting the years, months, weeks, days and minutes {{to the end of his}} six-year term.|$|E

25|$|After Penny’s autopsy {{revealed}} {{that she had}} ingested a lethal amount of liquid nicotine, Grissom and his team noted that there were traces of glue {{on the model of}} Penny’s back, and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> that she had been sitting in. This led them to believe that the killer had assumed that Penny would have died in her chair from her poisoned cherry brandy, not expecting her to go into convulsions. As Penny stood up in her spastic fits, the killer revealed herself, previously hiding behind Penny, and threw Penny through the window. With the miniature already made to depict Penny dead in her chair, the killer showed signs of obsessive habits, having to fix the model by rearranging it to match the actual death scene before it could be seen by anybody else. This explained why the miniature was not at the scene of death as the first one had been. A camera from Penny Garden's neighborhood showed Ernie Dell (Natalie's foster father) delivering the miniature wearing a jacket with a train symbol on the back.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} of the room has other signs of wealth; the brass chandelier is large and elaborate by contemporary standards, {{and would have been}} very expensive. It would probably have had a mechanism with pulley and chains above, to lower it for managing the candles (possibly omitted from the painting for lack of room). The convex mirror at the back, in a wooden frame with scenes of The Passion painted behind glass, is shown larger than such mirrors could actually be made at this date – another discreet departure from realism by van Eyck. There is also no sign of a fireplace (including in the mirror), nor anywhere obvious to put one. Even the oranges casually placed to the left are a sign of wealth; they were very expensive in Burgundy, and may {{have been one of the}} items dealt in by Arnolfini. Further signs of luxury are the elaborate bed-hangings and the carvings <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> and bench against the back wall (to the right, partly hidden by the bed), also the small Oriental carpet on the floor by the bed; many owners of such expensive objects placed them on tables, as they still do in the Netherlands.|$|E

Each May Day, seated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> noted by Mrs Delany and {{accompanied}} by his wife, he would give the poor children of Hampton money and cakes. A woman who attended one such May Day event later recalled: [...] "When I was called up, I took my six [...] into the Temple, where Mr Garrick was sitting by the fine bust with great cakes before him; he took down all their names, and then gave a shilling {{and a piece of}} plum-cake to every individual one; not even leaving out poor babes in their mothers' arms." ...|$|E
5000|$|Despite popular belief, <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> was not {{designed}} for the non-objective painter Wassily Kandinsky, who was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Bauhaus faculty at the same time. Kandinsky had admired the completed design, and Breuer fabricated a duplicate for Kandinsky's personal quarters. <b>The</b> <b>chair</b> became known as [...] "Wassily" [...] decades later, when it was re-released by Italian manufacturer Gavina, who had learned of the anecdotal Kandinsky connection {{in the course of}} its research <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair's</b> origins.|$|R

500|$|The {{video was}} filmed during September 9–11, 1994 at the Lenox Lounge and on {{location}} on Lenox Avenue in Harlem. McDaniel {{and her team}} scouted out low-rent, speak-easy locations and they did street-casting, assembling off-beat characters, from transvestites to card tricksters and edgy Harlem teenagers. However, {{when it came to}} filming there was a problem—McDaniel's approach was to start the camera and let the cast improvise, but Madonna wanted direction. She would sit <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> and when McDaniel said [...] "Action", she would still sit there saying impatiently, [...] "What am I doing? What am I doing? Hello?" [...] The director was overawed by Madonna's big entourage and had held herself from speaking her mind about the singer's look. She later asked Madonna to appear edgy like Jennifer Jason Leigh's character in the 1990 drama film Last Exit to Brooklyn. Madonna had her hair and makeup re-done and it was the final look for the video.|$|E
500|$|Other, less obvious, {{elements}} of the painting reveal more about the poet's personality and ideas. The poem he is attempting to write is entitled [...] "Upon Riches", {{which suggests that the}} poet lives in a fantasy world, while his wife and child go hungry. Ned Ward's first published poem in 1691 was The Poet's Ramble After Riches, which satirised his own struggles as an impoverished aspiring poet, and Hogarth may have had this in mind when he produced the picture. Earlier impressions showed the poem as [...] "Poverty, A Poem", which hinted at a connection to Theobald who had written [...] "The Cave of Poverty, A Poem, Written in Imitation of Shakespeare" [...] in 1714. The poet's dreams of riches are further suggested by the map that hangs over his head, entitled [...] "A View of the Gold Mines of Peru", replacing the image of Pope that appears in the earlier states of the print. The poet's self-interest is hinted by the presence of his pipe and tobacco on the window sill, the mug of beer sitting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> {{in the back of the}} room, the lace cuffs drying by the fire, his ill-fitting wig, and gentleman's sword lying at his feet; it may be that despite his family's circumstances, he refuses to forgo his own personal pleasures and effects. Alternatively, his fantasy of earning a fortune from his art may require that he keeps his gentlemanly accoutrements around him, as they will be required when his fantasies are realized.|$|E
500|$|Like {{the music}} videos for [...] "If I Were a Boy", [...] "Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It)", and [...] "Diva", {{the one for}} [...] "Ego" [...] was shot in black and white. The word [...] "bitch" [...] is muted out when Beyoncé sings, [...] "I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch!". [...] "Ego" [...] is the first video from I Am... Sasha Fierce in which she has curly afro hair, {{similar to the one}} in [...] "Work It Out". It is also the first video from the Sasha Fierce disc of her album where she does not don her robot-glove. The video {{features}} Beyoncé and her two backup female dancers all dressed in silver leotards and performing similar choreography, which has reminiscence of that of [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)". Later, Beyoncé sits on a white glittery chair in front of the same tiled background; she is wearing black coat and the two dancers are still dancing in unison around her. There are a few shots of her <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> facing the back of the camera with the dancers doing the same. Beyoncé then gets up to join the dance being executed by the two female around the chair. This scene ends as they walk {{to the left of the}} camera, into the next scene. Beyoncé is still with the tiled background. She and her dancers are now holding poles as props with which they dance. During the same pole scene, some shots of her singing in the chair are intercut. In the next scene, with the same tiled background, Beyoncé is leaning against the wall as the bridge of the song has been reached. Her dancers spin in heels around her, and they all then continue to dance against the wall. The last scene shows Beyoncé in the chair, without the black jacket and still dancing until the song ends.|$|E

2500|$|SFG postulates a rank scale, {{in which}} the highest unit is the clause and the lowest is the morpheme: coming from the largest unit down, we can divide the parts of a clause into groups and phrases; and coming from the {{smallest}} units up, we can group morphemes into words. Typically, groups are made out of words while phrases are made out of groups: e.g. clause constituents (the apples) (are) (<b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair),</b> phrase constituents (<b>on)</b> (<b>the</b> <b>chair),</b> group constituents (the) (apples), word constituents (apple)(s). In that sense, each unit of a rank typically consists {{of one or more}} units of the rank below, not of the same rank (see rank-shifting section for exceptions to this typical pattern). At group/phrase rank besides nominal group, Halliday proposes also the [...] "verbal group", the [...] "adverbial group", the [...] "prepositional group" [...] (e.g. from under), and the [...] "prepositional phrase" [...] (e.g. from under the sofa).|$|E
