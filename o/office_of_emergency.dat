5|$|Mechanical {{equipment}} was installed on floors four through seven, including 12transformers on the 5th floor. Several emergency generators {{installed in the}} building were used by the New York City <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> <b>Emergency</b> Management, Salomon Smith Barney, and other tenants. In order to supply the generators, 24,000gallons (91,000L) of diesel fuel were stored below ground level. Diesel fuel distribution components were located at ground level, up to the ninth floor. After the World Trade Center bombings of February 26, 1993, New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani decided to situate the emergency command center and associated fuel tanks at 7World Trade Center.

5|$|While {{none of the}} {{affected}} counties or cities {{declared a state of}} emergency following the event, the Small Business Administration did approve a request by the <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> <b>Emergency</b> Services for a disaster declaration in late September. This formality paved the way for low interest loans for commercial or residential properties that suffered damage, but only about 50 claims were expected. Local authorities had trained for disasters on a regular basis, and the response to the light damage was considered smooth, though some officials sought room for improvement. Discussions followed the event, with local governments focusing on telecommunication problems, emergency power systems, and seismic safety.|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{assess the}} {{preparedness}} of the US mass fatality infrastructure, we developed and tested metrics for 3 components of preparedness: organizational, operational, and resource sharing networks. Methods In 2014, {{data were collected}} from 5 response sectors: medical examiners and coroners, the death care industry, health departments, faith-based organizations, and <b>offices</b> <b>of</b> <b>emergency</b> management. Scores were calculated within and across sectors and a weighted score was developed for the infrastructure. Results A total of 879 respondents reported highly variable organizational capabilities: 15 % had responded to a mass fatality incident (MFI); 42 % reported staff trained for an MFI, but only 27 % for an MFI involving hazardous contaminants. Respondents estimated that 75 % of their staff would be willing and able to respond, but only 53 % if contaminants were involved. Most perceived their organization as somewhat prepared, but 13 % indicated “not at all. ” Operational capability scores ranged from 33 % (death care industry) to 77 % (<b>offices</b> <b>of</b> <b>emergency</b> management). Network capability analysis found that only 42 % of possible reciprocal relationships between resource-sharing partners were present. The cross-sector composite score was 51 %; that is, half the key capabilities for preparedness were in place. Conclusions The sectors in the US mass fatality infrastructure report suboptimal capability to respond. National leadership is needed to ensure sector-specific and infrastructure-wide preparedness for a large-scale MFI...|$|R
5|$|In the Gulf of Mexico, Shell Oil {{evacuated}} about 40{{workers from}} drilling operations. BP and Chevron also evacuated workers from platforms {{in the western}} and central Gulf, though neither predicted substantial effects on production. A few oil refineries on land were closed, such as one operated by Marathon Oil in Texas City, Texas. Governor of Texas Rick Perry issued a disaster declaration for 17Texas counties that were threatened by Tropical Storm Edouard. Perry activated up to 1,200National Guard troops, a 70member rescue team, six helicopters, and an incident management team that brings food and water to affected areas. Under the order, about 200buses became available in San Antonio and Houston to help in evacuations. Dow Chemical shut down their plants in Clear Lake and La Porte. The United States Coast Guard also ceased cargo operations to the Galveston-Houston area by late on August4. Governor of Louisiana Bobby Jindal declared a statewide emergency.

Emergency assistance was also offered by the Tennessee Department of Human Services for low income victims in the counties affected by the tornadoes. In addition, the Nashville Predators announced that for their game on February 7 against the Tampa Bay Lightning, half the ticket sales revenue would be donated to the American Red Cross to help with their efforts, and that fans could make additional donations to Red Cross volunteers at the arena's main entrances.

40|$|CHDS State/LocalThe Philadelphia {{metropolitan}} {{region is}} the fifth most populated metropolitan region in the United States.

The Philadelphia metropolitan region presents a challenge of coordination because there are two FEMA regions, two state borders, two state <b>offices</b> <b>of</b> <b>emergency</b> management, eight county emergency management offices, and 317 local government emergency management coordinators involved. This thesis examines three regional networks to identify the features of successful regional arrangements. The research includes the assessment of leadership, structure, and regional performance to identify features that can serve as recommendations for the Philadelphia Metropolitan Region. The research reviews the impact of federalism on regional networks and identifies one system [...] the Metropolitan Planning Organization [...] that serves shared federal, state, and local functions within regions. Recommendations center on creating a regional integrative network that utilizes existing fire service capacity to deliver functional homeland security...|$|R
