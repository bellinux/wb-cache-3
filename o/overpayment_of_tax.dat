40|$|Legally {{effective}} {{for the last}} thirty years, {{the provisions of the}} Decree of Oct. 26, 1956 are presently found to be obsolete to a considerable degree. They comply with the conditions of the forties and fifties. Legal and financial institutions of this regulation as well as its wording required adjustments to current socio-economic conditions and legal position. These postulates have been satisfied by virtue of the Act of Dec. 19, 1980, of Liabilities to Pay Taxes. A different regulation of several questions was introduced in the new law. The following provisions are to be numbered among the controversial matters: authority of administration for a taxpayer's house search and simultaneously not mentioning of explicit premises to be satisfied to create grounds for the search, retention of an institution of taxation at estimate. The substantial changes involve a different treatment of such problems as dates <b>of</b> settlement <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> liabilities and <b>of</b> their extinction, <b>overpayment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tax</b> and the interest on it, limitation rules <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> liabilities, liability <b>of</b> a taxpayer's spouse, his family members and third persons to pay his <b>taxes,</b> explicit definitions <b>of</b> the subject matter of taxation and of persons coming within the scope of this law, unification of dates of payment for the taxpayers.
