2500|$|Take it for {{one hundred}} days {{and you will be}} a genie. To cross streams or pass through fire, smear the soles <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> with it and {{you will be able to}} walk on water. After taking only three {{spatulas}} of it you will see that the Three Corpses and the Nine Worms in your body will disappear, and all your illnesses will be cured [...] (4, tr. Ware 1966: 77) ...|$|E
2500|$|ERICKSON: You know, I had {{one patient}} this last July who had {{four or five}} years of {{psychoanalysis}} and got nowhere with it. And someone who knows her said, [...] "How much attention did you give to the past?" [...] I said, [...] "You know, I completely forgot about that." [...] That patient is, I think, a reasonably cured person. It was a severe washing compulsion, as much as twenty hours a day. I didn't go in to the cause or the etiology; the only searching question I asked was [...] "When you get in the shower to scrub yourself for hours, tell me, do you start {{at the top of your}} head, or the soles <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet,</b> or in the middle? Do you wash from the neck down, or do you start with your feet and wash up? Or do you start with your head and wash down?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I should love to tickle {{the bottom}} <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> with a feather," [...] {{continued}} the cruel woman. [...] "Please {{take off your}} shoes." ...|$|E
5000|$|Maddison {{is also a}} freekick specialist, he {{describes}} his unusual freekick technique as use the side <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>foot,</b> but you're hitting it more with your heel. If you hit with {{the middle of the}} side <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>foot</b> it just curls. If you hit it the way I do, it goes straight and moves at the same time ...|$|R
5000|$|Put <b>your</b> left <b>foot</b> {{on the line}}, {{then place}} <b>your</b> right <b>foot</b> on the line ahead <b>of</b> <b>your</b> left, with the heel <b>of</b> <b>your</b> right <b>foot</b> against the toe <b>of</b> <b>your</b> left <b>foot.</b>|$|R
50|$|Squad will advance, about turn: do a 180 degree turn, {{pivoting}} on {{the heel}} <b>of</b> <b>your</b> right <b>foot</b> {{and on the}} toes <b>of</b> <b>your</b> left <b>foot,</b> always turn around your right shoulder.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now,' said Quilp, passing {{into the}} wooden counting-house, 'you mind the wharf. Stand upon your head agin, and I'll cut one <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> off.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{are holding}} a session of school here today," [...] {{explained}} Old Mother Nature. [...] "And {{we were just}} hoping that you would appear. Hold up one <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> and spread the toes, Little Joe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I really cannot believe it," [...] {{said the}} fisherman. [...] "That vase could not contain one <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> even, {{and how could}} your whole body go in? I cannot believe it unless I see you do the thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here {{are a dozen}} {{pairs of}} high boots. I noticed the size <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>foot,</b> and {{have no doubt that}} you will find some of these to fit you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We can go ahead, {{but we want}} to be mighty careful. Don't take a step {{until you}} are sure <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>footing.</b> If you find {{yourself}} sinking, grab hold of some tree or bush." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, dear, but {{you must}} take care <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>foot.</b> I wish I could go. Stop a minute, I think I can manage it after all;" [...] and Mrs. Bhaer ran out to the steps, waving her apron wildly.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, Christopher: {{really you}} did not. How tired and sad you do look--though I always know {{beforehand}} {{when you are}} in that state: one <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> has a drag about it as you pass along the pavement outside the window.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Does the grass-plot {{remember}} [...] The fall <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> [...] In Autumn's red ember [...] When drought leagues with heat, [...] When {{the last}} of the roses [...] Despairingly closes [...] In the lull that reposes [...] Ere storm winds wax fleet? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will bring}} you a hot-water bottle for the soles <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet,</b> also," [...] {{interposed}} Susan resolutely, [...] "and {{it would not be}} any relief to say that word you are thinking of, Miss Oliver, and that you may tie to." ...|$|E
50|$|Many pineboarders now use bindings. It {{allows for}} more tricks, {{including}} large jumps and better rotations, and more stability. However, bindings {{do not allow}} the rider to perform shove-its, {{and there is more}} freedom of motion without bindings. Bindings can be made from towstraps to cover the front <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>foot.</b> Shoelaces attached to the board can be tightened {{over the top of the}} back <b>of</b> <b>your</b> shoe to keep it from slipping out.|$|R
50|$|It {{is good to}} {{approach}} the ball at around 30 degrees. Turn the foot {{you are going to}} make the pass with outwards and lock the ankle so it is strong on contact with the ball. Bend the knee <b>of</b> <b>your</b> passing leg slightly so the foot is in the correct position to pass. With <b>your</b> standing <b>foot</b> about hip-width away from the ball, bring <b>your</b> kicking <b>foot</b> through and strike the middle of the ball with the inside <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>foot.</b> The aim <b>of</b> a short pass is generally to keep the ball low, thus making it easier for a teammate to control.|$|R
50|$|Squad, right turn: Use {{the heel}} <b>of</b> <b>your</b> right <b>foot</b> and the toes <b>of</b> <b>your</b> left to pivot to your right. Stamp down {{like you would}} in Squad Attention.|$|R
6000|$|... "My feet--hurt so--" [...] sobbed Rilla {{clinging}} to the last shred of her pride. It was less humiliating to admit crying because <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> than because--because somebody had been amusing himself with you, and your friends had forgotten you, and other people patronized you.|$|E
6000|$|... "About eighty fathoms," [...] {{said the}} captain; [...] "we shall now go along this level {{and get into}} the pump-shaft, by which we can descend to the bottom. Take care <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> and head as you go, for you'll be apt to run against the rocks that hang down, and the winzes are dangerous." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You deserve it. If {{you ever}} get sulky with me again, or call me Miss Wylie, I will kill you. I will tickle the soles <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> with a feather," [...] (Miss Lindsay shuddered, and hid her feet beneath the chair) [...] "until your hair turns white. And now, if you are truly repentant, come and record." ...|$|E
2500|$|Standard (soft) boots fit [...] "flow" [...] and [...] "strap" [...] {{bindings}} and {{are by far}} {{the most}} common. No part of the boot specifically attaches to the board. Instead, the binding applies pressure in several places to achieve firm contact. Soft boots have a flexible outer boot and an inner bladder. [...] The outer boot has a treaded sole. [...] The inner bladder provides support and helps hold the heel <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>foot</b> in place.|$|R
6000|$|Yours are the {{victories}} <b>of</b> light: <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> [...] Rest {{from good}} toil, where rest is brave and sweet. [...] But after warfare in a mourning gloom [...] I rest in clouds of doom.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{how could}} you dream of meeting?' [...] Nay, how can you ask me, sweet? All day my pulse had been beating [...] The tune <b>of</b> <b>your</b> coming <b>feet.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "And, think you, {{when he saw}} one <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> out of the stirrup, {{he would}} wait for the other to be free? Whoever comes into the woods {{to deal with the}} natives, must use Indian fashions, if he would wish to prosper in his undertakings. Go, then, talk openly to the miscreant, and seem to believe him the truest friend you have on 'arth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ann Veronica," [...] he said, [...] "I {{tell you}} this is love. I love the soles <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet.</b> I love your very breath. I have tried not to tell you--tried to be simply your friend. It is no good. I want you. I worship you. I would do {{anything}}--I would give anything to make you mine.... Do you hear me? Do you hear what I am saying?... Love!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll {{get hurt}} every time, if you dive like that," [...] he said. [...] "Look here," [...] {{and he stood}} up on the boat's deck. [...] "You {{want to get your}} weight on the fore part <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> all ready to shove off before you go. Then you must shoot as far forward as you can--falling on it won't do--and hollow your back and stiffen {{yourself}} once you're under. That is, when you want to skim along just below the surface. Watch me." ...|$|E
60|$|King. That {{which has}} made me king of France; for there The king <b>of</b> Paris at <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> lies dead.|$|R
50|$|In {{martial arts}} {{implying}} either barefooted combat or very light footwear, the strike is usually delivered by using {{ball of the}} foot (while pointing the foot toward the target area and keeping toes up to prevent injury) or by heel. When heavier footwear is used, there is an option using whole sole as a striking surface. It is also possible to kick with the top <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>foot</b> (the instep) in cases of striking at the groin or under the arm which can be very damaging.|$|R
5000|$|Let the Fear <b>of</b> God be <b>your</b> <b>feet,</b> and let His Love be your hands; let His Understanding be your eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Richard," [...] he announced, [...] "there's {{a hundred}} pounds in that. Away with it, pocketbook and all. Now put the soles <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> firmly {{on the ground and}} think what you're going to say to Nora when you get home. You've stood up against some nasty knocks. Now just tell {{yourself}} that they're all over. We'll take a feast home to-night. Waiter, open the wine. By Jove, I've heard that pop for other fellows often enough, but not one for myself for two years and more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Know'd an' studied it," [...] exclaimed Martha {{with more}} than her wonted vigour, [...] "ay, an' if you'd said you'd a'most broke your old mother's heart with it, you'd 'ave said {{no more than the}} truth, Tommy. It's a wonder as that rock hasn't brought me to a prematoor grave. However, it ain't likely to do so now, an' I'm glad they have not inveigled you into it, my boy; for it's an awful place for wettin' <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> an' dirt'in' of your hands and pinafores, an'--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{would let}} myself dwindle {{down to the}} level of drivelling fools," [...] he said. [...] "God knows, Lou, it would be easy enough now, when I hold those lovely little hands of yours, and the scent of sweet peas which comes from your dear self reminds me of summer, of old-fashioned gardens of {{enduring}} peace. Lou! I dare not even kiss your hands, and yet my whole body aches with the longing to press my lips on them. You see how easily I drift into being a drivelling fool? Would to God I could lie on the ground here before you, and feel the soles <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> on my neck. How lucky slaves were in olden days, weren't they? They could kneel before their mistress and she would place her naked foot upon their necks. I am a drivelling fool, you see--I talk and talk and let the moments slip by--I am going, Lou, and this is the vision which I am taking with me, the last impression which will dwell in my memory, when memory itself will seem only a dream. You, Lou, standing just here, so close to me that your sweet breath fans my cheek, your dear hands in mine, the scent of sweet peas in my nostrils. The light of this lamp throws a golden radiance over you, your lips are quivering--oh! ever so slightly, and your eyes reveal to me the exquisiteness of your soul. Lou, I am a lucky mortal to have such a vision on which to let my memory dwell!" ...|$|E
25|$|The Bigfoot {{researchers}} {{say that no}} human can walk that way in the film. Oh, yes they can! When you're wearing long clown's feet, you can't place the ball <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>foot</b> down first. You have to put <b>your</b> <b>foot</b> down flat. Otherwise, you'll stumble. Another thing, when {{you put on the}} gorilla head, you can only turn your head maybe a quarter of the way. And to look behind you, you've got to turn your head and your shoulders and your hips. Plus, the shoulder pads in the suit are {{in the way of the}} jaw. That's why the Bigfoot turns and looks the way he does in the film. He has to twist his entire upper body.|$|R
5000|$|When Colvin {{refused to}} get up, she was {{thinking}} about a school paper she had written that day about the local custom which prevented blacks from using the dressing rooms and trying on clothes in department stores. [...] In a later interview, she said: [...] "We couldn't try on clothes. You had to take a brown paper bag and draw a diagram <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>foot</b> ... and take it to the store”; and [...] "She couldn't sit in the same row as us because that would mean we were as good as her".|$|R
6000|$|... "Know you! I {{should know}} you well if I saw but the heel <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>foot.</b> Why, what {{a head of}} hair you have got, and so dark too! but it doesn't curl as it used once." [...] And she stroked his hair, and looked into his eyes, {{and put her hand}} to his cheeks. [...] "You'll think me an old fool, Master Frank: I know that; but you may think what you like. If I live for the next twenty years you'll always be my own boy; so you will." ...|$|R
