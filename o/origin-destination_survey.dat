The study is intended to identify some sectorial and regional enclaves of the industry that could be strategic for market diversification and to facilitate production chains. Estimates of land freight movements are made based on the <b>origin-destination</b> <b>survey</b> carried out by the Ministry of Transportation in 2008. The different regional and sectorial flows are projected through a geodetic network model. The results indicate that regional differences in product specialization explain the movement of cargo from specific industries, while in other cases there are no significant flows because the industries largely serve local markets...|$|E
30|$|The Santiago 2012 Travel Survey 7 (also {{known as}} <b>Origin-Destination</b> <b>survey,</b> or ODS) {{contains}} 96, 013 trips from 40, 889 users. The {{results of this}} survey {{are used in the}} design of public policies related to transportation and land use. The survey includes traffic analysis zones of the entire Metropolitan Region, encompassing Santiago and nearby cities. We use this zoning resource for two reasons. On the one hand, the extent and boundaries of each area within a zone take residential and floating population density, administrative boundaries, and city infrastructure into account. This enables the comparison of several phenomena between zones. On the other hand, it allows us to integrate other sources of information, providing results that can be compared to other datasets such as land use properties [9].|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{analyses}} {{the sensitivity}} of the subjective value of travel time (SVT) by considering different models based on the microeconomic theory of time allocation, as well as different econometric specifications of discrete choice models, and provides empirical evidence of this. Thus, the objective is to estimate wage rate and expenditure rate models together with a model that includes cost-weighted income. For this purpose we use discrete choice econometric models in which heterogeneity among individuals is introduced. Taking into account that the most important benefit of a transport infrastructure project is the value of the travel time saved, the subjective value of time (SVT), the results allow us to determine which microeconomic model and empirical specification are the most robusto In addition, we can obtain comparisons of the values obtained for different countries and areas of study.

Using an <b>Origin-Destination</b> <b>survey</b> to account for non-existing ties, the dataset provides the support to model an initial phase (tie formation) and an adaptation phase (tie evolution), with a population wide scope. The model results add empirical evidence about the relevance of the role of homophily (similarity between social contacts) in aspects such as age, gender, and similar occupation, especially in the initial phase. In contrast, the adaptation phase is strongly related with heterophily, possibly reflecting variety seeking behavior. Other factors, such as the evolving role of geographical distance and personal network size, also illustrate further aspects that need to be taken into account on these processes...|$|E

40|$|This study explores {{telecommuter}} travel behaviour {{by examining}} discretionary travel distance and mode choice. The study utilizes {{data obtained from}} the 2005 <b>origin-destination</b> <b>survey</b> conducted by TRANS, a joint transportation planning committee serving the National Capital Region of Canada. The study compares and explains the discretionary travel behavior of teleworkers relative to other population groups and identifies that the average teleworker travels 3 times farther than regular workers and 1. 7 times farther than non-workers for discretionary purposes. Regression indicates that dependent children, vehicle accessibility, housing type, residential distance to the urban core, land-use mix, residence within a Greenbelt region and {{day of the week}} all positively affect travel distance. Conversely, age, proximity to shopping centers and inclement weather demonstrate significant negative effects. Then, through binary logistic regression, the study confirms that work status significantly influences mode choice. Similarly, the following predictor variables demonstrate a significant positive effect towards active mode choice: teleworker work status, larger household size, greater income, warmer temperature, closer proximity to shopping centers, apartment housing type, trips for recreational and restauran...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to propose a sequential method for spatial interpolation of mode choice for household locations where choices are unobserved based on Decision Tree analysis and Geostatistics. Initially, Decision Tree analysis was applied in order to estimate the probability of mode choice in surveyed households, thus determining the numeric variable to be estimated by Ordinary Kriging. The data used is from the <b>Origin-Destination</b> <b>Survey</b> and Urban Transportation Evaluation Survey, carried out in 2007 / 2008 in the city of S&# 227;o Carlos (S&# 227;o Paulo/Brazil). The study area selected for geoestatistical modeling is a small region of the city with 110 sampling points. The mode choice was estimated for the study area revealing a tendency of increasing the probability of car usage from the center to the periphery of region.

We use cell phones data to estimate the distribution of the population in the city using different periods of time. We compare those results with traditional methods (urban polling) using data from Buenos Aires <b>origin-destination</b> <b>surveys.</b> Traditional polling methods have a much smaller sample, in the order of tens of thousands (or even less for smaller cities), to maintain reasonable costs. Furthermore, these studies are performed at most once per decade, in the best cases, in Argentina and many other countries.

40|$|The for-hire motor carrier {{industry}} is a vital component of the Ontario economy. The {{industry is}} presently going {{through a period of}} instability brought about by a variety of changes. This research deals with one such change, namely, recent changes in the economic regulation of the for-hire industry. This research focuses on the impact of this regulatory reform on the industry and on the Province in general. The two main issues identified in past research include the impact of regulatory reform on the rates for trucking service, and the impact on service to small/remote areas. An improved methodology for examining rate levels is utilized to analyze the 1987 T. O. D. (Trucking <b>Origin-Destination</b> <b>Survey)</b> data for intraprovincial shipments in Ontario. This analysis supports the existence of rate differentials based on commodity type, area size and location, and shipment type (Truckload, Less-Than Truckload). In previous research, these differentials have been linked with the impact of regulation and this work suggests that these impacts are worthy of further investigation once the data, necessary to conduct a before and after comparison of the industry with regard to regulatory reform, becomes available...|$|E
40|$|Understanding through trip {{patterns}} {{is crucial}} when making decisions concerning a traffic diversion strategy, {{such as whether}} to build a highway to bypass a city. While conducting a vehicle license plate <b>origin-destination</b> <b>survey</b> {{may be the most}} accurate way to estimate through trip patterns, many small communities may be unable to bear this cost. Thus, a simple and affordable sketch planning tool to estimate through trip movements would be useful. Three through trip estimation methods that have been used or published are Modlin’s method, Anderson’s method, and subarea analysis. Subarea analysis, while an effective tool, requires personnel with knowledge of modeling software, as well as a license for that software. Hence, subarea analysis may be of limited use to small cities and DOT district offices. Anderson and Modlin methods on the other hand are simpler to implement. However, these methods require some data that are not routinely collected, use parameters that can be highly subjective, and rely on calculations that may distort the results. To address some of the shortcomings of the existing methods, a logit-based external trip estimation method was created that had strong statistical justification. Evaluation of the logit model using small cities in Indiana yielded results that are usually better than Modlin’s and Anderson’s methods. The logit model is readily implemented in a spreadsheet and requires only two input variables. When subarea analysis using modeling software is not feasible, the logit model has been shown to produce good estimates of through trips...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{transport}} mode choice behaviour of different socio-demographic groups {{has been studied}} in a middle size European city. Data have been extracted from an extensive <b>origin-destination</b> <b>survey</b> (10, 029 individuals and 28, 225 trips) conducted in Trieste in 2002 - 03. Gender, age, employment and vehicle availability are important variables in mode choice. These variables have been explicitly introduced within the utility function of a Random Utility Model (Multinomial Logit Model). The proposed model allows to evaluate the effects of different transportation planning initiatives on different socio-demographic groups. In particular the improvement of transit performances would benefit more elderly, women especially housewives and retired than young people, men and workers. On the contrary any car network level-of-service worsening would negatively impact on non elderly and workers and on mothers with children much more than on non-workers or single individuals because they could respectively use busses or motorcycles. The effects of any transportation initiatives do not impact on {{the population as a}} whole, but on the contrary their effects are quite different for different socio-demographic groups. These differences should be considered within the assessment of any transportation planning process, at least for two reasons: on one hand they allow to better perform the policy design phase and, on the other hand, they allows to better predict the effects of any transportation scenario. The introduction of socio-demographic variables within a mode choice model should be aimed not only to improve the statistical evaluation of the model but also to increase its descriptive potentialities...|$|E

30|$|One of the {{problems}} encountered in traffic safety analysis {{is that it is}} difficult to obtain reliable exposure between different vehicle types such as trucks, buses, cars, two wheelers (2 Ws) and three wheelers (3 Ws). In one of the few studies dealing with this issue, Nationwide Personal Travel Survey data were used to estimate vehicle miles driven as measure of exposure [1]. Bhalla et al. [2] estimated exposure between pair of vehicles as the product of number of vehicles of that type and average vehicle miles travelled by that vehicle. Overall exposure of vehicles can be estimated from <b>origin–destination</b> <b>surveys</b> or household surveys, but these are not easily available. However, these exposure estimates do not tell us much about the actual interaction between vehicles on the road. Attempts to correlate total distance travelled (exposure) to vehicular interaction would be inaccurate as vehicular interactions significantly depend on vehicle positioning pattern in addition to density and composition. Recently, some studies have tried to understand microscopic vehicular interactions that contribute to accidents [3, 4, 5]. Oh et al. [4] suggested that exposure is equal to the total time a vehicle pair spend in following. Their approach allows for more precise measurement of exposure between the two vehicle types on a given road. The simulation model was calibrated and validated using traffic characteristics such as volume, density, speeds, occupancy time, etc., and then used to predict the exposure. This approach of using microscopic traffic flow simulation can be further explored to determine the exposure or interaction rate between different types of vehicles using the field data.|$|R
40|$|As {{the number}} of urban dwellers {{worldwide}} increases and as governments struggle to meet the pressure a concurrent rise in personal travel places on cities, the importance in understanding travel demand becomes vital. Traditional approaches to understanding the interaction between built form and travel have focused on individual indicators such as population density or land use mix, while measuring outputs such as vehicle kilometers travelled or mode share. Activity spaces, in contrast, are a relatively new and underexplored measure of travel demand which looks at the distribution of trips throughout space. These activity spaces {{are the focus of}} the following manuscript. A variety of land use and accessibility measures are described and calculated, the goal being to discern their effect on activity spaces in the Montreal, Sherbrooke and Quebec metropolitan regions. Clustering is used to find representative combinations of urban form indicator values, or neighborhoods, after which statistical analysis is employed to quantify the relationships between these clusters and the travel patterns of the households living in them. The primary data sources for mobility are <b>origin-destination</b> <b>surveys</b> conducted 5 years apart in each city; three such surveys were used for Montreal, two for Quebec and one for Sherbrooke. Results indicate that neighborhood type has a significant effect on the dispersion of travel, even after controlling for household size and type, number of trips and other demographic characteristics. Another key finding is that average activity space size is correlated with overall city size. Finally, the geometry of trip distribution is related to propensity for using specific transportation modes...|$|R
40|$|Attracting and {{retaining}} public transport passengers {{is a common}} policy goal amongst cities worldwide. Understanding new users of services is crucial to achieving this goal. This thesis addresses this challenge by examining unfamiliar public transport travel. The overarching {{aim of the research}} is: To explore unfamiliar public transport trips to better understand their circumstances, experiences and significance to mode choice. This aim is being addressed through exploration of ‘first trips’ or ‘unfamiliar public transport travel’; that is, the first time using a public transport route never taken before. There is very limited previous research directly concerning experiences of unfamiliar transit journeys and their impact on subsequent travel behaviour; therefore the Review of Literature draws from a wider, multi-disciplinary pool of research to explore the conceptual framework of unfamiliar public transport travel. For example, studies in psychology have repeatedly shown that first impressions are associated with higher rates of recall and influence on subsequent attitudes, a phenomenon referred to as the ‘primacy effect’ (Stiff et al. 1989; Forgas 2011; Le-Klähn et al. 2014). This suggests that unfamiliar public transport trips could be particularly important to attitudes and subsequent travel behaviour. Four research methods were employed to collect and analyse primary data related to the topic. 1) Thirty audio-recorded semi-structured interviews provided rich qualitative data and insights about unfamiliar public transport travel. 2) The Origin-Destination (OD) Survey involved working with the research sponsor, Public Transport Victoria (PTV), to add questions to a very large annual <b>origin-destination</b> <b>survey</b> of transit users to better understand circumstances of unfamiliar transit travel. 3) The University Access Survey employed a web-based survey of Monash University staff and students to learn about their first trips to campus by public transport and compare those experiences with their subsequent transit travel to campus. 4) The PTV Journey Planner Poll & Follow up Survey utilised a popular transit passenger information website to conduct a poll and then recruit respondents to complete a ‘post-trip’ follow up survey, enabling monitoring of any shifts in attitudes and reporting about unfamiliar travel experiences soon after they occurred. The Discussion and Conclusions draws together the key findings from the research and confers the practical applications and implications of the research, as well as suggesting the direction for further research...|$|E
40|$|Ridesharing {{is quite}} a popular topic of {{discussion}} among transport authority personnel. It {{is perceived to be}} a viable alternative to classical modes of transportation, and receives a great deal of political support from transport planners. However, not much objective information is available on ridesharing behaviors. We use travel survey data to study the evolution of the ridesharing market in an urban area. Our study is based on data from four large-scale OD surveys conducted in the Greater Montreal Area (1987, 1993, 1998 and 2003). In the latest survey conducted in Montreal, car passengers were asked to identify the driver who gave them the opportunity to travel in this way. Their answers were classified according to the type of driver; for instance, a member of their household, a neighbor or a co-worker. We use this information to calibrate a model matching car passengers and car drivers belonging to the same household. This will be referred to as IHHR (intra-household ridesharing). Preliminary results reveal that approximately 70 % of all trips made by car passengers are the result of IHHR. Furthermore, around 15 % of those trips are questionable, in that they were exclusively generated for another individual’s purposes, consequently generating an additional trip for the journey back home. Moreover, this percentage increased over time. Objective data regarding ridesharing and its evolution in an urban area will undoubtedly help decision makers gain a clearer profile of this means of travel and help to realign attitudes on the issue.

This thesis examines the extent of network development since 1970, and attempts to determine the some of the spatial effects of the 1987 deregulation of the airline industry on nodal accessibility. Accessibility is a relative term and difficult to define explicitly. While it {{can be measured in}} distance or time, it may also be measured as the frequency of links between places over time. In this thesis the connectivity among places is used as a surrogate for accessibility, and {{the presence or absence of}} a link between places selected, indicates the level of accessibility. Data from <b>origin-destination</b> <b>surveys,</b> and contemporary industry journals in 1970, 1983 and 1990 were analyzed among 149 settlements in Canada. Comparisons are made between the spatial pattern of intercity connectivity for the pre- and post-deregulation periods. Structural and service provisions are examined to determine the extent of change in the industry, and how these have led to changes in accessibility between places. Hypotheses about the effects of deregulation on nodal accessibility are tested using multiple linear regression models. Although the Canadian domestic market has experienced rapid growth within the past two decades, several of the dramatic changes occurred during the first decade. Further, although deregulation in the United States has shown a propensity for destructive competition, and community-based changes have benefitted largermarkets (to the detriment of smaller communities), similar changes have not occurred in Canada. The results show that post-deregulation spatial strategies have not produced a spatial concentration of nodal accessibility, as originally feared...|$|R
40|$|This work {{examines}} the temporal-spatial variations of daily automobile distance traveled and {{greenhouse gas emissions}} (GHGs) and their association with built environment attributes and household socio-demographics. A GHGs household inventory is determined using link-level average speeds for a large and representative sample of households in three <b>origin-destination</b> <b>surveys</b> (1998, 2003 and 2008) in Montreal, Canada. For the emission inventories, different sources of data are combined including link-level average speeds in the network, vehicle occupancy levels and fuel consumption characteristics of the vehicle fleet. Built environment indicators over time such as population density, land use mix and transit accessibility are generated for each household {{in each of the}} three waves. A latent class (LC) regression modeling framework is then implemented to investigate the association of built environment and socio-demographics with GHGs and automobile distance traveled. Among other results, it is found that population density, transit accessibility and land-use mix have small but statistically significant negative impact on GHGs and car usage. Despite that this is in accordance with past studies, the estimated elasticities are greater than those reported in the literature for North American cities. Moreover, different household subpopulations are identified in which the effect of built environment varies significantly. Also, a reduction of the average GHGs at the household level is observed over time. According to our estimates, households produced 15 % and 10 % more GHGs in 1998 and 2003 respectively, compared to 2008. This reduction is associated to the improvement of the fuel economy of vehicle fleet and the decrease of motor-vehicle usage. A strong link is also observed between socio-demographics and the two travel outcomes. While number of workers is positively associated with car distance and GHGs, low and medium income households pollute less than high-income households...|$|R

Results show that in Mexico City neither zones located next to the new lines, nor zones located next to the lines built before 1990 had a higher growth of population, income per capita or employment, as compared to other zones with similar densities and incomes per capita. In the case of Santiago, whereas the areas located next to the newly built line had similar changes to other zones, the areas located next to the two lines built before the 1990 's had a significantly higher growth in number of households and average income per capita than other areas, especially in high-income districts. These results are explained by the lower attractiveness of the metro for middle and high-income people in Mexico City as compared to Santiago de Chile, which is proven by specifying relations between ridership and GDP for both cities, using multiple regression models. (cont.) The potential of land value capture as a mechanism for funding rail transit in both cities is discussed, based on the experience of other rail transit systems around the world, and on the characteristics of both metros. In both cases a land value capture system is proposed for new lines. Some guidelines for the implementation of land value capture mechanisms are provided. by Alvaro Covarrubias. Thesis (M. C. P.)

40|$|In several {{developing}} countries {{it is often}} assumed that low-income {{segments of the population}} living at the periphery of the cities are those affected the most by poor conditions of transportation accessibility. Inorder {{to gain a better understanding}} of the way transportation accessibility is distributed across different regions of an urban area, the main aim of this work is to analyze, making use of Spatial Statistics tools ina GIS (Geographical Information System) environment, the relationship between accessibility and geographical locations in a medium-sized Brazilian city. Data of an <b>origin-destination</b> (O-D) <b>survey</b> carried out in the city of Bauru, which brings information about four different transportation modes, were used in this study. Such data, grouped following the census tracts, were carefully examined in a Geographic Information System in order to look for spatial patterns of accessibility that are not visible inthe traditional approaches. One of the interesting outcomes of the application was the identification of regions with particular dynamics, which go against the pattern found in the overall urban area. This andother results of the case study clearly indicate that Spatial Statistics analyses in a GIS environment create a powerful tool to extend conventional transportation accessibility analysis...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims to find {{relations}} between the socioeconomic characteristics, activity participation, land use patterns and travel behavior of the residents in the Sao Paulo Metropolitan Area (SPMA) by using Exploratory Multivariate Data Analysis (EMDA) techniques. The variables influencing travel pattern choices are investigated using: (a) Cluster Analysis (CA), grouping and characterizing the Traffic Zones (17), proposing the independent variable called Origin Cluster and, (b) Decision Tree (DT) to find a priori unknown relations among socioeconomic characteristics, land use attributes of the origin TZ and destination choices. The analysis {{was based on the}} <b>origin-destination</b> home-interview <b>survey</b> carried out in SPMA in 1997. The DT application revealed the variables of greatest influence on the travel pattern choice. The most important independent variable considered by DT is car ownership, followed by the Use of Transportation ""credits"" for Transit tariff, and, finally, activity participation variables and Origin Cluster. With these results, it was possible to analyze the influence of a family income, car ownership, position of the individual in the family, use of transportation ""credits"" for transit tariff (mainly for travel mode sequence choice), activities participation (activity sequence choice) and Origin Cluster (destination/travel distance choice).

40|$|This {{research}} aims at estimating a GHG {{emission inventory}} at the household level using completely disaggregate trip data and {{taking into account}} all emitting modes. The impact of urban form (UF) and transit accessibility (TA) characteristics on household level GHG emissions is then quantified and compared {{to the impact of}} the introduction of emerging green technologies. Using a large and representative sample of household diaries, trip-level GHG emissions are estimated by combining different sources of data (<b>origin-destination</b> (OD) <b>survey</b> data, vehicle fleet characteristics, transit ridership data, etc.) and by using modelling tools (traffic assignment and GHGs models). Moreover, UF and TA indicators are developed and combined to generate neighbourhood typologies. A simultaneous equation modelling framework is then implemented to investigate the link between UF, TA, socio-demographics, and travel GHGs, taking into account the well known “self-selection” issue. The potential impact of land use and transit supply strategies with emerging green technological scenarios is then compared. This is evaluated through the modification of current fuel consumption rates with those provided by new technologies such as hybrid transit buses and continuous improvement of vehicle fuel consumption rates. Our findings are consistent with the literature, more specifically we have found that the built environment (BE) attributes are statistically significant (10...|$|R
40|$|Cities {{are faced}} with many challenges, in {{particular}} {{in relation to the}} mobility of people and the structure of land-use. Parking management, which makes the link between the fields of urban planning and transportation, is one of the crucial ways to meet these challenges. However, parking studies are a poorly covered area in transportation research. The main barrier to study parking is parking data availability. In the Greater Montreal Area, data from <b>origin-destination</b> (OD) <b>surveys</b> are helpful in understanding typical travel behavior. These surveys have been conducted for forty years and provide useful data to describe and model various spatial-temporal features of daily mobility. This research illustrates the use of OD survey data to develop indicators on parking spaces and use in a given area. This study confirms that the systematic processing of car driver trips from travel surveys allows developing vehicle accumulation profiles for various zones and, from these, derive theoretical parking capacities. This research provides an assessment {{of the quality of the}} estimation by comparing the estimations from OD survey to other sources of data, namely geographical data and field surveys. The paper shows that parking capacity is subject to high variability and highlights that its assessment is quite complex and must take into account regulation data that modulates the availability of the ra...|$|R
