5|$|The UMWA used {{civil disobedience}} to attract {{attention}} {{to the needs of}} the miners. The union stressed that all actions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> must remain peaceful. However, many miners still used violent methods during the strike. The strike gained the media's attention. People came from all across the country to support the UMWA's cause, and around 50,000 people went to southwest Virginia during the course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{possible}} {{influence the}} stepped leader movement has on <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> distance is studied. <b>The</b> numerical values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> distances {{are most frequently}} verified from the lightning channel photos. There is some explanations for dispersion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> distance which usually appear on tall structures. Unusually long striking distance {{may be influenced by}} the positive space charge or prior upward flashes. One more parameter which may have influence in estimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> distance is a complex charge motion in the leader channel. Through introduction of two types of charge motions, possible shortening is shown <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> distance seen on the lightning channel photos...|$|R

5|$|Although ten {{men died}} {{during the course of}} the hunger strike, {{thirteen}} others began refusing food but were taken off hunger strike, either due to medical reasons or after intervention by their families. Many of them still suffer from the effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> with problems including digestive, visual, physical and neurological disabilities.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the second}} day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> which has spread to Buffland's rival city of Clearfield , the mood among the laborers has turned ugly. Temple warns that the attacks on Algonquin Avenue are imminent, and aids Farnham's force in turning back assaults on the captain's house and on the Belding residence. Bott and Sleeny are {{captured}} by the force; the former is sent to prison but Farnham has pity on Sleeny as a good workman, and the carpenter serves only a few days. The settlement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> in Clearfield takes the wind out of the Buffland action, and soon most are back at work, though some agitators are dismissed.|$|E
5|$|City life {{continued}} relatively normally, {{especially during}} daytime hours. Schools remained open. Later claims {{against the city}} for losses incurred during the two nights of disorder ran to $35,000, of which the city paid $34,000. Those figures represent a non-partisan calculation of the costs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> to the Boston business community.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>strike</b> was {{ended when}} the Oberste Heeresleitung {{declared}} an aggravated state of siege, put some factories under military protection and conscripted many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> workers for military service.|$|R
50|$|Although most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strikes</b> {{did take}} place at {{foreign-owned}} facilities, a few Chinese companies also experienced labor unrest.|$|R
5|$|Japanese temple bells are struck {{externally}} {{with either}} a hammer or a suspended beam rather than with an internal clapper. The sound of the bell {{is made up of}} three parts. First is the atari, the impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b> A well-made bell should produce a clean, clear tone. The initial sound <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> is immediately followed by the prolonged oshi, the reverberation that continues to sound after the bell is struck. This is higher in pitch and is a low rumble with a sorrowful air, rich in harmonics; it lasts for up to ten seconds. Finally comes the okuri or decay, the resonance that is heard as the vibration of the bell dies away, which can last up to a minute. There are also continuous harmonic overtones heard throughout the tolling of the bell. These multiple tones create a complex pitch profile.|$|E
5|$|While {{critical}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> {{the public}} {{did not necessarily}} support the cause of equal employment opportunities for black workers. A public opinion poll conducted in Philadelphia during the strike showed that only a slim majority of the city's population felt that blacks should be hired as motormen and conductors, but that a significant majority opposed having a strike over this issue.|$|E
5|$|Any {{baseball}} game involves {{one or more}} umpires, who make rulings {{on the outcome of}} each play. At a minimum, one umpire will stand behind the catcher, to have a good view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> zone, and call balls and strikes. Additional umpires may be stationed near the other bases, thus making it easier to judge plays such as attempted force outs and tag outs. In Major League Baseball, four umpires are used for each game, one near each base. In the playoffs, six umpires are used: one at each base and two in the outfield along the foul lines.|$|E

5|$|Bill Haywood {{had left}} the WFM and was {{organizing}} for the IWW {{by the time the}} Lawrence Textile Strike in Lawrence, Massachusetts garnered national attention. On January 11, 1912, textile mill workers in Lawrence left their jobs in protest of lowered wages. Within a week, twenty thousand workers were on strike. The IWW already had a presence in Lawrence and assumed leadership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the strike, despite {{considerable}} tensions, {{the city}} of Philadelphia remained mostly calm {{and there were no}} major outbreaks of violence. All of the city's newspapers editorialized against the strike and the public was, by and large, opposed to the strike as well. Several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> leaders, including James McMenamin and Frank Carney, were arrested for violating the anti-strike act. The NAACP played an active role both in pressuring the PTC and the federal government to institute fair hiring practices at the PTC for several years before the strike, and in maintaining the calm during the strike itself.|$|E
5|$|Endara's term {{in office}} saw marked {{economic}} recovery from the nation's years of military rule. During his presidency, Panama had an average annual economic growth of 8%. However, unemployment also rose near 19%. In February 1990, the overweight Endara began a hunger strike in the Metropolitan Cathedral {{to call attention to}} the nation's poverty and to pressure US President George H. W. Bush to dispense previously pledged American aid. In the course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> he lost more than thirty of his two hundred and sixty pounds.|$|E

5|$|In {{the police}} commissioner's Annual Report for 1919, Curtis {{presented}} his view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b> He {{argued that he}} had not even needed the requested State Guards for the strike's first night because the city remained quiet and he had reports that many policemen would not join the strike. By {{the end of the year}} the strikers had formed a new organization called the Association of Former Police of the City of Boston.|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} {{reported}} that the CWU had started a fighting fund to help support postal workers who were experiencing financial difficulties as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b> Postmen lose a day's pay for each day they strike, and although most workers had lost just two days pay so far, many in the London area who had taken part in previous industrial action {{earlier in the year}} had lost as much as 18 days of wages. There was also speculation that the CWU lacked the funds for a lengthy dispute and donations to the union's fighting fund were pledged by other unions, including UNISON and Unite.|$|E
5|$|On 27 October 1980, republican {{prisoners in}} HM Prison Maze began a hunger strike. Many prisoners volunteered {{to be part}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> but a total of seven were {{selected}} to match {{the number of men}} who signed the Easter 1916 Proclamation of the Republic. The group consisted of IRA members Brendan Hughes, Tommy McKearney, Raymond McCartney, Tom McFeeley, Sean McKenna, Leo Green, and Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) member John Nixon.|$|E

5|$|On November 4, Election Day for Indianapolis {{political}} offices, {{bands of}} pro-union men roved {{the city and}} vandalized property, burnt streetcars, harassed public officials, and effectively shut down {{much of the city}} in the worst violence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b> Sheriff Porttens again ordered the police to protect the streetcars, but another twenty-nine officers resigned; because the force was so short on men, the sheriff refused their resignation and put them on other duties.|$|E
5|$|The Cripple Creek {{strike was}} a major victory for the miners' union. The Western Federation of Miners used the success <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> to {{organize}} almost every worker in the Cripple Creek region – including waitresses, laundry workers, bartenders and newsboys – into 54 local unions. The WFM flourished in the Cripple Creek area for almost a decade, even helping to elect most county officials (including the new sheriff).|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} act {{of civil disobedience}} during the Pittston strike was Moss 3. Since the strike {{had been going on}} for a few months, with no settlement expected in the near future, union members began to lose hope. Thousands of people had already been arrested and a lot of money had been spent on a cause that seemed to be never ending. Union members knew that something had to be done to regain the spirit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> and make it clear to Pittston that they would not give up.|$|E
