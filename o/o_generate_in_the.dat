To confirm that the effect of heme on the Na+/K+ ATPase is through the generation of H 2 O 2, we measured enzyme activity using increasing concentrations of H 2 O 2 and, as expected, <b>the</b> activity increased <b>in</b> a dose-dependent manner until a concentration of 0. 1 μM H 2 O 2. To investigate the role of PKC in this signaling pathway, we observed the production of H 2 O 2 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> presence of its activator phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA) and its inhibitor calphostin C. Both showed no effect on the generation of H 2 O 2. Furthermore, we found that PKC activity is increased <b>in</b> <b>the</b> presence of H 2 O 2, and that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> presence of calphostin C, H 2 O 2 is unable to activate the Na+/K+ ATPase. 100 μM of Mito-TEMPO was capable of abolishing the stimulatory effect of heme on Na+/K+ ATPase activity, indicating that mitochondria might be the source of the hydrogen peroxide production induced by heme. The modulation of L. amazonensis Na+/K+ ATPase by H 2 O 2 opens new possibilities for understanding the signaling pathways of this parasite...|$|R

For the series gabbro–tonalite–granite, we have phase relationships with excess H_ 2 O to 35  kbar (3500  MPa), and the H_ 2 O-undersaturated liquidus surfaces mapped with contours for H 2 O contents and with fields for near-liquidus minerals. Isobaric diagrams with low H_ 2 O contents provide grids potentially useful in defining limits for the H_ 2 O content of magmas, based on the sequence of crystallization. Conclusions from the experimental framework include: (1) The H_ 2 O content of large granitic bodies is less than 1. 5 %. (2) Primary granite magmas can not be derived from the mantle or subducted ocean crust. (3) Primary granite magmas with low H_ 2 <b>O</b> content are <b>generated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crust, and erupted as rhyolites. (4) Primary tonalite and andesite are not generated from mantle peridotite; the H_ 2 O contents required are unrealistically high. (5) Primary tonalite and andesite are not <b>generated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crust unless temperatures are significantly {{higher than those of}} regional metamorphism. (6) Subducted ocean crust yields magmas with intermediate SiO_ 2 content, but not primary tonalite and andesite. (7) Batholiths are produced from crustal rocks as a normal consequence of regional metamorphism, with the formation of H_ 2 O-undersaturated granite liquid and mobilized migmatites.

40|$|AbstractA {{continuous}} water disinfection {{process can be}} used to prevent the introduction and accumulation of obligate and opportunistic fish pathogens in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS), especially during a disease outbreak when the causative agent would otherwise proliferate within the system. To proactively prevent the accumulation of fish pathogens, ozonation and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation processes have been used separately or in combination to treat water in RAS before it returns to the fish culture tanks. The objective {{of the present study was}} to determine the process requirements necessary to disinfect the full RAS flow, using ozonation followed by UV irradiation, just before the flow was returned to the fish culture tank(s). We found that a proportional-integral (PI) feed-back control loop was able to automatically adjust the concentration of ozone (<b>O</b> 3) <b>generated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> oxygen feed gas (and thus added <b>in</b> <b>the</b> low head oxygenator) in order to maintain the dissolved O 3 residual or ORP at a pre-selected set-point. We determined that it was easier and effective to continuously monitor and automatically control O 3 dose using an oxidative reduction potential (ORP) probe (in comparison to a dissolved ozone probe) that was located at the outlet of the O 3 contact chamber and immediately before water entered the UV irradiation unit. PI control at an ORP set-point of 450 and 525 mv and a dissolved O 3 set-point of 20 ppb provided almost complete full-flow inactivation of heterotrophic bacteria plate counts (i. e., producing < 1 cfu/mL) and improved water quality (especially color and %UVT) in a full-scale recirculating system. Achieving this level of treatment required adding a mean dose of approximately 29 ± 3 g O 3 per kg feed. However, because water is treated and reused repeatedly in a water reuse system, the mean daily O 3 demand required to maintain an ORP of 375 – 525 mV (or at 20 ppb dissolved O 3) was 0. 34 – 0. 39 mg/L, which is nearly 10 times lower than what is typically required to disinfect surface water in a single pass treatment. These findings {{can be used to}} improve biosecurity and product quality planning by providing a means for {{continuous water}} disinfection in controlled intensive RAS...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE. TO {{determine}} {{the ability of}} the aqueous humor to generate and degrade H 2 O 2, the effect of environmental factors such as oxygen tension and temperature, and the constituents contributing to the observed results. METHODS. Aqueous humor was carefully removed from bovine eyes within 3 hours of death. Standard and new techniques were used to follow H 2 O 2 degradation and formation. Catalase activity was measured by H 2 O 2 decomposition, usually at 100 /xM and 10 mM H 2 O 2, and in some cases by O 2 generation. RESULTS. Bovine aqueous humor generated and degraded H 2 O 2. The generation of H 2 O 2 was minimal at 0 °C but increased as temperature increased, so that at 37 °C at 3 hours, approximately 90 jitM H 2 O 2 was observed. Degradation was more complex. At 0 °C, only a slow rate of degradation was observed. At 25 °C, it was more rapid, and a steady state between generation and degradation was observed at approximately 30 JLLM. However, at 37 °C, starting with 100 jaM H 2 O 2, degradation was initially rapid, but then generation became predominant and H 2 O 2, concentration increased to more than 100 juM in 3 hours. No H 2 <b>O</b> 2 was <b>generated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> absence of <b>O</b> 2, and H 2 O 2 production increased with increasing O 2 tension.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Foot-and-mouth disease viruses (FMDVs) {{are members}} of the {{picornavirus}} family and cause an economically important disease of cloven-hoofed animals. To understand the structural basis of antigenic variation in FMDV, we have determined the structures of two viruses closely related to strain O 1 BFS whose structure is known. RESULTS: The two new structure are, like O 1 BFS, both serotype O viruses. The first, O 1 Kaüfbeuren (O 1 K), is a field isolate dating from an outbreak of FMD <b>in</b> Europe <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1960 s. The second, called G 67, is a quadruple mutant of <b>O</b> 1 K, <b>generated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> laboratory, that bears point mutations conferring resistance to neutralizing by monoclonal antibodies, specific {{for each of the four}} major antigenic sites defined previously. The availability of the three related virus structures permits a detailed analysis of the way amino acid substitutions influence antigenicity. Structural changes are seen to be limited, <b>in</b> general, to <b>the</b> substituted side chain. For example, the GH loop of VP 1, a highly antigenic and mobile protuberance which becomes ordered only under reducing conditions, was essentially indistinguishable <b>in</b> <b>the</b> three viruses despite the accumulation of up to four changes within its 15 -residue sequence. At one of the other antigenic sites, however, changes between the two field strains did perturb both side-chain and main-chain structures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vicinity. CONCLUSIONS: The conservation of conformation of the GH loop of VP 1 adds to the evidence implicating an integrin as the cellular receptor for FMDV, since this loop contains a conserved RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) sequence structurally similar to <b>the</b> same tripeptide <b>in</b> some other integrin-binding proteins. Structural changes required for the virus to escape neutralization by monoclonal antibodies are generally small. The more extensive type of structural change exhibited by the field isolates probably reflects differing selective pressures operating in vivo and in vitro...|$|R
30|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> past decades, the {{deterioration}} of global climate and the growing shortage of oil resources have become major issues for mankind. Therefore, {{the need to develop}} new kinds of power sources that are environmental-friendly and sustainable in terms of development is becoming increasingly urgent. Nowadays, several renewable energies, such as solar radiation, wind, waves, and geothermal energy, have been expected to solve these major issues. However, all of these sources exhibit the same demerit of intermittence which restricts their practical applications [1, 2, 3, 4]. More recently, Li-ion and other battery-related technologies have been the most convenient form of energy storage and are the key solution to the global energy crisis. In particular, lithium–oxygen batteries (LOBs) have received unprecedented attention owing to their superhigh theoretical energy density (1 – 2  kWh kg− 1) [5], which is comparable to gasoline and far exceeds any other subsistent rechargeable electrochemical energy storage technology [6, 7, 8]. However, there are still many challenges {{that need to be addressed}} concerning practical development [7, 8, 9]. The first and most critical problem is the high discharge/charge overpotential. It is well known that Li 2 <b>O</b> 2 is <b>generated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> course of discharge at about 2.7  V and then decomposed at a high voltage up to 4 or 4.5  V <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process because of its poor conductivity [10]. During the cycling processes, {{the deterioration}} of the electrolyte and the formation of the secondary product Li 2 CO 3 can occur between the interfaces of the oxygen electrode. The insoluble Li 2 CO 3 can isolate the Li+ and O 2; this can extremely affect the reversibility and sustainability of <b>the</b> LOBs [11]. <b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> round-trip efficiency will be reduced directly by <b>the</b> high overpotential. <b>In</b> other words, more energy is wasted during the “input” and “output” conversion process of the batteries.|$|R
40|$|In most {{instances}} separate electrocatalysts {{are needed to}} promote the reduction of O 2 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fuel cell mode and to <b>generate</b> <b>O</b> 2 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> energy storage-water electrolysis mode in aqueous electrochemical systems operating at low and moderate temperatures (T {{greater than or equal}} to 200 C). Interesting exceptions are the lead and bismuth ruthenate pyrochlores in alkaline electrolytes. These catalysts on high area carbon supports have high catalytic activity for both O 2 reduction and generation (1, 2). Rotating ring-disk electrode measurements provide evidence that the O 2 reduction proceeds by a parallel four-electron pathway. The ruthenates can also be used as self-supported catalysts to avoid the problems associated with carbon oxidation, but the electrode performance so far achieved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> research at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) is considerably less. At <b>the</b> potentials involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> anodic mode the ruthenate pyrochlores have substantial equilibrium solubility in concentrated alkaline electrolyte. This results <b>in</b> <b>the</b> loss of catalyst into the bulk solution and a decline in catalytic activity. Furthermore, the hydrogen generation counter electrode may become contaminated with reduction products from the pyrochlores (lead, ruthenium). A possible approach to this problem is to immobilize the pyrochlore catalyst within an ionic-conducting solid polymer, which would replace the fluid electrolyte within the porous gas diffusion O 2 electrode. For bulk alkaline electrolyte, an anion-exchange polymer is needed with a transference number close to unity for the Oh(-) ion. Preliminary short-term measurements with lead ruthenates using a commercially available partially-fluorinated anion-exchange membrane as an overlayer on the porous gas-fed electrode indicate lower anodic polarization and virtually unchanged cathodic polarization...|$|R
40|$|We {{compare the}} output of an 18 -box geochemical model of the ocean with {{measurements}} to investigate the controls on both the mean values and variation of nitrate ? 15 N and ? 18 O <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ocean interior. The ? 18 O of nitrate is our focus {{because it has been}} explored less in previous work. Denitrification raises the ? 15 N and ? 18 O of mean ocean nitrate by equal amounts above their input values for N 2 fixation (for ? 15 N) and nitrification (for ? 18 <b>O),</b> <b>generating</b> parallel gradients <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ? 15 N and ? 18 O of deep ocean nitrate. Partial nitrate assimilation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> photic zone also causes equivalent increases <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ? 15 N and ? 18 O of the residual nitrate that can be transported into the interior. However, the regeneration and nitrification of sinking N can be said to decouple the N and O isotopes of deep ocean nitrate, especially when the sinking N is produced in a low latitude region, where nitrate consumption is effectively complete. The ? 15 N of the regenerated nitrate is equivalent to that originally consumed, whereas the regeneration replaces nitrate previously elevated in ? 18 O due to denitrification or nitrate assimilation with nitrate having the ? 18 O of nitrification. This lowers the ? 18 O of mean ocean nitrate and weakens nitrate ? 18 O gradients <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interior relative to those in ? 15 N. This decoupling is characterized and quantified <b>in</b> <b>the</b> box model, and agreement with data shows its clear importance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> real ocean. At the same time, the model appears to generate overly strong gradients in both ? 18 O and ? 15 N within the ocean interior and a mean ocean nitrate ? 18 O that is higher than measured. This may be due to, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> model, too strong an impact of partial nitrate assimilation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Southern Ocean on the ? 15 N and ? 18 O of preformed nitrate and/or too little cycling of intermediate-depth nitrate through the low latitude photic zone...|$|R
