The impact of inter-year variations in environmental conditions on the blood concentrations of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) was examined in black-legged kittiwakes breeding in Kongsfjorden, Svalbard. In addition, it was examined if inter-year variations in concentration of POPs were affecting circulating thyroid hormone (TH) levels. Blood samples were collected from breeding kittiwakes during the incubation period in 2008 (n= 46) and 2009 (n= 31), two different years in respect of environmental conditions. The whole blood samples were analyzed for POPs: polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs; PCB- 28, - 52, - 99, - 118, - 101, - 138, - 153, 180, - 183, - 187, - 194), hexachlorobezene (HCB), hexachlorocyclohexan (HCH), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (p,p -DDT), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p -DDE) <b>oxychlordane,</b> cis-chlordane, trans-chlordane, cis-nonachlor, trans-nonachlor, heptachlor, heptachloroepoxid, and mirex, using gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Plasma was analysed for concentrations of total triiodothyronine (T 3), using radioimmunoassay. Associations between variables of POPs and T 3 were analysed using univariate statistics. Biometric measurements of the kittiwakes; body mass, skull length, and wing length where included in the statistical analysis, together with calculated BC (BC; body mass controlled for body size). Associations between the variables were analysed using multivariate statistics. The PCBs were the dominant contaminants in both 2008 and 2009. The three major constituents in the kittiwakes were PCB- 153, followed by PCB- 138 and PCB- 180. Even though the body condition of the kittiwakes was significant poorer in 2009 compared to 2008, the concentrations of PCBs and DDE did not differ between 2008 and 2009. The concentration (ng/g wet weight [w. w. ]) of HCB and <b>oxychlordane</b> were significant higher in 2009 compared to 2008. There was a strong negative association between HCB and body condition of the kittiwakes. Also the concentration of <b>oxychlordane</b> was negative correlated to body condition.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Organochlorine (OC) {{insecticides}} and {{polychlorinated biphenyls}} (PCBs) {{have been shown}} to have estrogenic, antiestrogenic, or antiandrogenic properties; as a result, the impact of exposure to these compounds and risk of hormonal cancers, such as prostate cancer, is a concern. OBJECTIVES: We conducted a nested case-control study, using prospectively collected serum, to estimate associations between OC exposures and metastatic prostate cancer in a population-based cohort from Norway. METHODS: Sera from 150 cases and 314 controls matched on date of blood draw, age at blood draw, and region was used to determine concentrations of 11 OC pesticide metabolites and 34 PCB congeners. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) for quartiles of lipid-corrected metabolite levels were calculated using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Metastatic prostate cancer was two times as likely among men with serum concentrations of <b>oxychlordane</b> in the highest quartile compared with those in the lowest quartile (OR = 2. 03; 95 % CI: 1. 03, 4. 03; p-trend 0. 05). Elevated but nonsignificant ORs were estimated for the highest versus lowest quartile of heptachlor epoxide, HCB, and mirex, although these exposures were correlated with <b>oxychlordane.</b> Findings for specific PCB congeners showed a significant inverse association between natural log-transformed lipid-adjusted PCB 44 and metastatic prostate cancer (OR = 0. 74; 95 % CI: 0. 56, 0. 97; p-trend = 0. 02).

Among those with highest OC pesticides (3 rd tertile), the odds ratio for the risk of lower cognitive function was about 6 to 11 for the highest quintile of age (80 - 85 years) vs. the first quintile of age (60 - 63 years), while the association between age and lower cognitive function became flatter in those with lower OC pesticides (combined 1 st and 2 nd tertiles). Both DDT and DDE showed no interaction, with lower DSST scores for higher age irrespective of serum concentrations of DDT or DDE. Even though DSST score measures only one aspect of cognition, several OC pesticides modified aging-related prevalence of low cognitive score, a finding which should be evaluated in prospective studies...|$|E
40|$|The overall aim of {{the present}} study was to {{elucidate}} selective environmental up-take processes in Arctic food webs that lead to the bioaccumulation of persistent organic pollutants (POP) in food items consumed by Arctic indigenous people. In addition, this study aimed to increase the scientific understanding of the principles behind climate change related influences on transport processes of contaminants. Svalbard and Nuuk, Greenland were chosen as study areas since they represent Arctic conditions, e. g. glaciers, different marine water masses, long-range transport of POPs and few local sources of POPs. In addition, Greenland has a large population of indigenous people consuming traditional food on a daily basis. This thesis is based on field campaigns and empirical data. Legacy pesticides were analysed in water samples from a Greenlandic fjord (paper I). The pesticide distribution indicated that glaciers and snow caps around the fjord are secondary sources of contaminants for the coastal marine environment. Chlordanes were identified as potential indicator compounds for meltwater runoff (paper I). α-hexachlorocyclohexane (α-HCH), trans-, cis- and <b>oxychlordane</b> were chosen for enantiomer selective analyses in zooplankton from Svalbard and Greenlandic traditional food items (paper II, III). The enantiomeric fraction (EF) of α-HCH in the zooplankton was associated to ice cover/break-up. EFs of cis-chlordane were reflected in the deviation from racemic EF among <b>oxychlordane.</b> Chiral pesticides and enantiomer selective analyses are recommended for further studies regarding their potential as marker for changes of the physical environment (paper II). Non-racemic EFs were detected for almost all food samples. Hence, species specific distribution exists, and can be an important factor in future dietary advices. Levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), perfluorinated alkylated substances (PFAS) and pesticides were below tolerable daily intake threshold in the food items (paper III, IV). PFAS was detected in the marine mammals, but not in the fish samples, most likely due to industrial processing of the fish (paper IV) ...|$|E

We tested whether adult survival rate, breeding probability and breeding success the year of sampling and the following year were affected by blood levels of mercury or persistent organic pollutants in Svalbard black-legged kittiwake Rissa tridactyla, by using capture-mark-recapture models over a five-year period. Survival rate was negatively linked to HCB levels in females, to chlordane mixture and <b>oxychlordane,</b> tended to decrease with increasing PCBs or DDE levels, but was unrelated to mercury. Breeding probability decreased with increasing mercury levels during the sampling year and with increasing CHL or HCB levels during the following year, especially in males observed as breeders. Surprisingly, the probability of raising two chicks increased with increasing HCB levels. Although levels of these legacy pollutants are expected to decline, they represent a potential threat for adult survival rate and breeding probability, possibly affecting kittiwake population dynamics...|$|E

We investigated our hypothesis that the association between age and cognition was stronger in those with higher serum concentrations of organochlorine (OC) pesticides, common persistent and strongly lipophilic neurotoxic chemicals. Participants were 644 elders aged 60 - 85, participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999 - 2002. Six OC pesticides (p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), p,p'-dichlorodipenyldichloroethylene (DDE), β-hexachlorocyclohexane, trans-nonachlor, oxy-chlordane, and heptachlor epoxide) were evaluated. “Lower cognitive function ” was defined as having a low Digit-Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) score (< 25 th percentile of DSST score, cutpoint 28 symbols substituted).

Among OCPs, p,p'-DDE and sum-chlordanes were the highest in concentration. With increasing hepatic contaminant concentrations and activities of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes, the concentrations of 3 -methylsulfonyl-p,p'-DDE and the concentration ratios of pentachlorophenol/hexachlorobenzene increased, and the toxaphene pattern shifted more towards persistent Parlar- 26 and - 50 and less towards more biodegradable Parlar- 44.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{prevalence}} of diabetes is higher among Mexican Americans than among non-Hispanic whites. Higher serum levels of organochlorine pesticides in Mexican Americans have been reported. Few studies have explored {{the association between}} pesticide exposure and diabetes. OBJECTIVES: We set out to examine the association between self-reported diabetes and serum concentrations of organochlorine pesticides among Mexican Americans residing in the southwestern United States from 1982 to 1984. METHODS: This study was conducted among a sample of 1, 303 Mexican Americans 20 – 74 years of age from the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Serum concentrations were available for seven pesticides or pesticide metabolites at quantifiable levels in at least 1 % of the study population: p,p´-DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane), p,p´-DDE (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene), dieldrin, <b>oxychlordane,</b> β-hexachlorocyclohexane, hexachlorobenzene, and transnonachlor.
