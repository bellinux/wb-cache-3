40|$|Suppose that a {{sequence}} <b>of</b> <b>treatments</b> {{are assigned to}} influence an outcome of interest that occurs after the last treatment. Between treatments there exist time-dependent covariates that may be posttreatment variables <b>of</b> the earlier <b>treatments</b> and confounders <b>of</b> the subsequent <b>treatments.</b> In this article, we develop a parametric approach to inference of the causal effect <b>of</b> the <b>treatment</b> sequence on the outcome called the sequential causal effect. We construct a point parametrization for the conditional distribution of an outcome given all treatments and time-dependent covariates, in which the point parameters of interest are the point effects <b>of</b> <b>treatments</b> considered as single-point treatments. We (1) identify net effects <b>of</b> <b>treatments</b> by point effects <b>of</b> <b>treatments,</b> (2) express patterns of net effects <b>of</b> <b>treatments</b> by constraints on point effects <b>of</b> <b>treatments,</b> and (3) show that all sequential causal effects are determined by net effects <b>of</b> <b>treatments.</b> Accordingly we (1) estimate net effects <b>of</b> <b>treatments</b> through point effects <b>of</b> <b>treatments</b> by maximum likelihood, (2) improve the estimation by constraints on point effects <b>of</b> <b>treatments</b> and assignment conditions <b>of</b> <b>treatments,</b> and (3) use the estimates of net effects <b>of</b> <b>treatments</b> to obtain those of sequential causal effects. As a result, we obtain unbiased consistent maximum-likelihood estimates of sequential causal effects even for long treatment sequences.

5|$|Anticoagulation, which {{prevents}} further coagulation, {{but does not}} act directly on existing clots, is the standard treatment for DVT.

5|$|Interferons, a {{subclass}} of cytokines, {{are produced}} in the body during illnesses such as influenza {{in order to help}} fight the infection. They are responsible of many of the symptoms of influenza infections, including fever, muscle aches, fatigue, and headaches. Many patients report influenza-like symptoms hours after taking interferon-beta that usually improve within 24 hours, being such symptoms related to the temporary increase of cytokines. This reaction tends to disappear after 3 months <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> and its symptoms can be treated with over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen, that reduce fever and pain. Another common transient secondary effect with interferon-beta is a functional deterioration of already existing symptoms of the disease. Such deterioration is similar to the one produced in MS patients due to heat, fever or stress (Uhthoff's phenomenon), usually appears within 24 hours <b>of</b> <b>treatment,</b> is more common in the initial months <b>of</b> <b>treatment,</b> and may last several days. A symptom specially sensitive to worsening is spasticity. Interferon-beta can also reduce numbers of white blood cells (leukopenia), lymphocytes (lymphopenia) and neutrophils (neutropenia), as well as affect liver function. In most cases these effects are non-dangerous and reversible after cessation or reduction <b>of</b> <b>treatment.</b> Nevertheless, recommendation is that all patients should be monitored through laboratory blood analyses, including liver function tests, to ensure safe use of interferons.|$|E

40|$|The {{robustness}} of {{incomplete block}} designs {{to the loss}} of all observations in a block is investigated in terms of the efficiency of the residual design. Previous results use the eigenvalues of the information matrix <b>of</b> the <b>treatment</b> effects to determine the overall efficiency of the implemented design, relative to the complete design, in terms of the average variance <b>of</b> pair-wise <b>treatment</b> comparisons. Here we use a simple generalized inverse of this information matrix to identify the variances of the individual pair-wise treatment comparisons and show the effects of the loss of a block on specific treatment comparisons. We determine results for balanced incomplete block (BIB) designs and Youden square designs and show that, although the overall efficiency remains high when a block is lost, comparisons <b>of</b> two <b>treatments</b> that appear in the missing block can be quite seriously affected. The efficiencies <b>of</b> individual <b>treatment</b> comparisons in a BIB design are shown to depend on the number <b>of</b> <b>treatments,</b> the number <b>of</b> blocks used in the initial design and the number <b>of</b> <b>treatments</b> in a block. However, we also show that, for a single replicate of a Youden square, the efficiencies <b>of</b> individual <b>treatment</b> comparisons depend only {{on the size of the}} block that is lost and not on the number <b>of</b> <b>treatments</b> being compared...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} issue in medicine {{is that the}} efficacy, the safety and the costs <b>of</b> medical <b>treatment</b> modalities are appropriately in concordance. Patient safety should be the dermatologist’s number one priority, especially in the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> non-life threatening diseases such as acne, vitiligo and psoriasis. In dermatology, intra-patient studies (right-left studies) provide an ideal means to evaluate the efficacy <b>of</b> topical <b>treatment</b> modalities. Double-blind, crossover studies have proven their benefit in systemic treatment. In addition to the observations by physicians, the patient’s quality of life studies became indispensable to determine the overall efficacy <b>of</b> the <b>treatment.</b> Assessing the costs <b>of</b> medical <b>treatment</b> is more complex. The costs <b>of</b> <b>treatments</b> are not only determined by the price of drugs, medical apparatus and duration <b>of</b> <b>treatments,</b> {{but also by the}} reduction of patient’s working hours, travel costs, and, last but not least, the costs of treating side effects of medication. Physicians and patients are both increasingly aware of the risks of medical interventions...|$|R
