2500|$|At Afragola the {{regiment}} received 18 Sherman tanks and then loaded all tanks onto trains {{to be taken}} across country to Foggia and from there moved into a brigade harbour area {{near the village of}} Lucera. By now, Lord O'Neill had been given command of {{the regiment}}, with Colonel Dawnay moving on to brigade staff. After a week in harbour, the regiment was sent on tank transporters to Mignano near Monte Cassino, which had fallen some days earlier {{along with the rest of}} the Gustav Line. The fighting was not over, however, as the Adolf Hitler Line, now renamed the Senger Line, lay just six miles north, and it would be the next objective. The Horse was briefed for Operation Chesterfield, which was an assault by the 1st Canadian Division supported by tanks of the North Irish Horse and the 51st Royal Tanks. H Hour was to be at 6am on 23 May. The plan required the 2nd and 3rd Canadian Infantry Brigades, supported by the two tank regiments, to break through the Hitler Line on a 3,000-yard front. The assaulting troops came under a withering hail of fire on the well-prepared killing grounds of the heavily defended German positions. The Horse took heavy casualties and had to regroup by merging depleted squadrons together. One tank slipped off a track and fell 50 feet into a ravine, rolling over on its turret and then back onto its tracks. The crew were shaken but unhurt, and the incident gave them another chance to display the marvellous climbing skills of the Churchill as they crawled slowly up the almost sheer walls of the ravine to re-enter the battle. During this battle, Major Griffiths again displayed great heroism and was later awarded the only bar to the MC that an officer of the regiment received. The total cost to the Horse in the engagement was 36 men killed in action and 32 tanks lost. This represented 60% of the regimental strength. The date of 23 May was later chosen as a [...] "Regimental Day" [...] to commemorate the bloodiest day in the history of the North Irish Horse, which lost more men than on any <b>other</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> two world wars. he breakthrough happened, however, and the German defenders began evacuating the position on the night of 23 May.
