5000|$|Okung was {{considered}} one of the best offensive tackles available in the 2010 NFL Draft, and drew comparisons to D'Brickashaw Ferguson. According to NFL.com's Gil Brandt, Okung [...] "will start and play a lot of years in the NFL." [...] NFL.com's Bucky Brooks even projected Okung as the No. 1 pick overall, as did Scout.com′s Chris Steuber. Sports Illustrated′s Tony Pauline described Okung as [...] "a complete offensive tackle with a large upside," [...] who [...] "stands out in pass protection while also dominating as a run blocker".

50|$|The 49ers had {{recently}} {{emerged as a}} dominant team after nearly a decade of ineptitude. During the '80s and '90s, they had been <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> top contenders, playing in ten conference championship games and winning five Super Bowls. But after a strong 2002 season, San Francisco went into a dismal slump in which they {{failed to make the}} playoffs for eight consecutive seasons. Following the end of the 2010 season, the 49ers hired Jim Harbaugh as their head coach. Harbaugh, who played 14 years in the NFL, joined the team after an impressive 12-1 season as the coach of Stanford, and in his first season with San Francisco he managed to turn their fortunes around, aided by breakout seasons from quarterback Alex Smith and receiver Michael Crabtree.|$|E
