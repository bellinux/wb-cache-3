50|$|In {{its natural}} habitat the tree depends mainly for success upon its prodigious seed production, the remarkably long {{life of the}} seed, and, after germination, rapid growth. In forest, whau is {{essentially}} a transient, <b>opportunist</b> <b>species.</b> The characteristics which cause it {{to be effective in}} such a role include: its ability to quickly occupy ground where light has been temporarily let into the forest; its tremendous rate of growth; its ability to rapidly produce fruit; its enormous seed production, especially as it is about to die; and the fact that its seeds are capable of germinating as soon as the capsules open. Whau seeds can be stimulated into growth by fire after lying {{on the surface of the}} ground for many years. Having germinated, whau establishes itself with striking rapidity. In a study on Taranga (Hen Island), in favourable conditions whau was often the first new plant to appear, followed by Urtica ferox (tree nettle), Macropiper excelsum (kawakawa), Coprosma macrocarpa (coastal karamu) and Coprosma lucida (shiny karamu); forest-dominating trees were slower to come in - Corynocarpus (karaka) most quickly, followed by Beilschmiedia tawa (tawa).|$|E

40|$|The {{shape of}} the productivity–diversity {{relationship}} (PDR) for marine phytoplankton has been suggested to be unimodal, that is, diversity peaking at intermediate levels of productivity. However, there are few observations {{and there has been}} little attempt to understand the mechanisms that would lead to such a shape for planktonic organisms. Here we use a marine ecosystem model together with the community assembly theory to explain the {{shape of the}} unimodal PDR we obtain at the global scale. The positive slope from low to intermediate productivity is due to grazer control with selective feeding, which leads to the predator-mediated coexistence of prey. The negative slope at high productivity is due to seasonal blooms of <b>opportunist</b> <b>species</b> that occur before they are regulated by grazers. The negative side is only unveiled when the temporal scale of the observation captures the transient dynamics, which are especially relevant at highly seasonal latitudes. Thus selective predation explains the positive side while transient competitive exclusion explains the negative side of the unimodal PDR curve. The phytoplankton community composition of the positive and negative sides is mostly dominated by slow-growing nutrient specialists and fast-growing nutrient <b>opportunist</b> <b>species,</b> respectively.

Following the anthropogenic impacts, management measures were introduced which allowed a gradual recovery of the seagrass bed and a new macrobenthic community structure manifested by production increases of slow-growing species, such as Scrobicularia plana and Hediste diversicolor. There was a gradual re-orientation of energy into population biomass instead of population density but this was not translated into higher community production, mainly due to the decreased {{production of}} <b>opportunist</b> <b>species</b> (H. ulvae and several polychaetes). Several weather extreme events occurred during this post-mitigation phase - floods, heatwaves and droughts, all of which had negative impacts on macrobenthic dynamics and production. The heatwaves led to the greatest decreases in macrobenthic production, mainly due to S. plana perhaps associated with its physiological intolerance of higher temperatures. The prolonged drought that followed the heatwaves maintained low levels of production by S. plana and H. ulvae. With climate change, the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events are likely to increase worldwide so that the recovery of impacted/disturbed systems from impacts such as eutrophication may be seriously affected by these additional stressors, compromising attempts to improve the ecological quality of estuarine ecosystems...|$|E

In the managed forests, species richness was highest in large young stands (3 - 10 years old) and in forests managed by even-aged systems (with large clear-cuts), mainly due to eurytopic and <b>opportunist</b> carabid <b>species</b> with high dispersal abilities. Oak and beech, uneven-aged, and mature stands were mainly inhabited by typical forest species, and even-aged conifer stands mainly by ubiquitous species. Several typical forest species recorded in unmanaged stands were lacking from the managed forests.

30|$|It {{has already}} been shown that {{plantation}} forests can be suitable as habitat, even to some rare and threatened species, mainly birds, amphibians and insects (Brockerhoff et al. 2008). The main changes that occur after afforestation relate to vegetation cover (Decocq et al. 2005). Planted forest stands are usually inhabited by a lower number of native species compared to native forests, but this number is in most cases greater than in degraded ecosystems. Thus, afforestation of abandoned land (meadows, pastures or agricultural fields) may maintain biodiversity by providing forest habitat, increasing ecotone area and connectivity between habitats (Brockerhoff et al. 2008). Small mammal abundance mostly depends on the heterogeneity of habitat and factors such as forest floor, presence of stones, vertical shelter and soil moisture (Carey and Harrington 2001).

Unfortunately, few studies monitoring the health of these grasslands have included arthropods, thus leaving out a vital biodiversity component. Ants have been proven to be reliable indicators of restoration success in some habitats. Literature regarding the benefits of ants in ecosystems is abundant; however, studies examining ant grassland ecology are limited. The availability of Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) land of different ages allowed us to examine differences in ant diversity (richness and abundance), species composition, and functional groups at different times since being restored as grasslands. Four sampling techniques were utilized (pitfall traps, litter samples, hand collection, and soil core sampling) on four different ages (0, 3, 7 - 8, 14 - 16 yrs) of grassland in east-central Missouri. Efficacy of sampling methods was also examined. A total of 18, 743 ants were collected, representing 28 species in 16 genera. Ants were most abundant in older ages of CRP land. Species richness peaked in 7 - 8 yr fields. Some species showed patterns of being either early colonizers, late colonizers, or present in all field ages. The functional groups Cold Climate Specialists, <b>Opportunists,</b> Cryptic <b>species,</b> and Generalized Myrmicines (in descending order) dominated CRP land. Pitfall traps were the most effective sampling method.

Unique to the annelids are giant extracellular pigments of two main varieties: the 3600 kDa erythrocruorins and the 400 kDa hexagonal- bilayer hemoglobins. The marine polychaete Capitella teleta {{has served as a}} model organism for numerous biological studies, yet very little work has been dedicated to understanding the types and properties of respiratory pigments utilized by this worm. As a temperate <b>opportunist,</b> this <b>species</b> is ideal for studying the effects laboratory induced changes in temperature and oxygen saturation on the structure and functionality of hemoglobin. The goal of this work was to determine what type of extracellular hemoglobin is normally present in C. teleta, and {{to determine the effects of}} warm versus cold acclimation on the concentration and subunit composition of this hemoprotein. It was observed that cold-acclimation induces two major changes in the morphology of C. teleta: an increase in body size and a change in red pigmentation. Using the pyridine hemochrome assay in conjunction with a heme activity assay, it was determined that the difference in pigmentation was due to a combination of effects. The 21 ??C worms had a greater concentration of hemoglobin than the 4 ??C worms, but less heme b. It has been suggested that this was due to a difference in the functional status of the heme b, as well as a minor difference in hemoglobin stability. Using size exclusion chromatography and native gel electrophoresis, the major extracellular hemoglobin in both warm- and cold-acclimated C. teleta was determined to be a 333 kDa hexagonal-bilayer hemoglobin composed of three major and up to three minor polypeptide chains that covalently bind to form disulfide-linked dimers and trimers. A major difference in the expression of these subunits between the experimental cultures was not detected. This study represents the first attempt at identifying and characterizing extracellular hemoglobins from C. teleta. It has established a strong foundation for future work on the purifcation and analysis of this important respiratory protein in a model annelid. University of Delaware, Department of Marine StudiesM.

40|$|Species {{richness}} is {{very important}} for the perseverance of Dutch grasslands. As eutrophication {{is one of the major}} threats to grasslands worldwide, more research is needed into the validity of accepted mechanisms and their ability to explain changes in species composition. The primary goal of this experiment was to give insights into the reaction of N-limited plant communities on eutrophication. This was done by measuring competition and productivity traits of three different functional groups, namely N-specialists, P-specialists and opportunists. Secondly was tried to find supporting evidence that these functional groups are useful in explaining plant community composition dynamics. To provide these results, a nine week during greenhouse experiment was set up using 1125 plants in these three specialisms. N-specialists used were Rumex acetosa, Crepis capillaris, Trisetum flavescens and Alopecurus pratensis. Succisa pratensis, Centaurea jacea, Briza media and N. stricta were used as P-specialists and finally Prunella vulgaris, Knautia arvensis, Carex oederi and Agrostis capillaris compiled the list of <b>opportunists.</b> All <b>species</b> were germinated and put into equal communities, which were divided over low and high nutrient levels under strong N-limitation (N:P < 5). Measurements show no differences in species richness and abundance levels for the different specialisms came back around 33 %. Evenness also showed no sign of uneven distribution among species or specialism. Results for the productivity trait show that N-specialists produce more above ground biomass than P-specialists and opportunists. This was also observed for the light competitions traits (canopy height & stretched leaf length). CSR-strategy was compared with the specialism groups but gave no conclusiveness as to validity of either classification. In general this research shows that eutrophication leads to higher expression in productivity and light competition traits. The relative difference between specialism was more clearly visible under higher nutrient levels. Where N-specialists perform better than P-specialists and opportunists, the differences between the latter two is minimal. However, it is not unlikely that some experimental shortcomings have caused the obscure results regarding P-specialists and opportunists. More evidence for the validity of these functional groups is needed and can be provided by research into these specialisms and their reaction on changing nutrient stoichiometry...|$|R

Regarding ecological guilds, 82 % were freshwater species (61 % of the biomass) which included all NIS, whereas 13 % of the catches were catadromous species (31 % biomass) corresponding to eels. Only 4 % were estuarine species (1 % biomass) and together marine estuarine <b>opportunists</b> and anadromous <b>species</b> accomplished 1 % (2 and 6 % biomass, respectively). The fish assemblage showed seasonal patterns with a clear distinction between autumn/winter and spring/summer periods. Significant differences in abundance and biomass were also detected between autumn/winter of 2007 / 2008 and 2008 / 2009, i. e., inter-annual variations, with the latter period with lower catches yet higher dominance of NIS. Besides, higher water temperature had a significant negative effect on the observed number of species, but a positive effect on the abundance and biomass of NIS. More attention has to be given to TFWs and their role in structuring fish assemblages, because this information is vital for a sound management, conservation and restoration of estuarine areas.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{increase}} in abundance of small-sized fishes is common after a reservoir is formed. There is an {{increase in}} the consumption of fish, from typically piscivorous fish to opportunistic species that take advantage of abundant resources. This study aims to evaluate the effects of diet changes induced by damming on the feeding activity and condition factor of typically piscivorous (Hoplias aff. malabaricus and Oligosarcus longirostris) and opportunistic (Astyanax lacustris (ex Astyanax altiparanae) and Pimelodus britskii). Sampling was conducted before and after the impoundment in the Iguaçu River in the region of Salto Caxias, Paraná State, Brazil. Stomach contents were analysed by the volumetric method. Feeding activity and body condition were inferred by the mean stomach repletion index and the mean condition factor. Typically piscivorous species presented a general tendency of decreased feeding activity and increased condition factor, while opportunistic species, presented a decrease in condition and feeding activity in the most affected sites. The increase in the condition factor of piscivorous fish suggests that these species benefit by the increased abundance of small size prey fish. Some <b>opportunist</b> <b>species</b> that do not have adjustments for the piscivorous diet, regardless of the intensity of consumption and resource availability, can suffer negative reflex when adopting a piscivorous diet...|$|E
40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypotheses}} that {{management of the}} soil food web in the fall would enhance grazing on bacteria and fungi by microbivorous nematodes in the spring, consequently increasing N availability in cover-crop driven organic and low-input farming systems. The food web was manipulated by irrigating the dry soil of late summer and/or providing carbon sources. By creating conditions conducive for biological activity, we increased the abundance of bacterivore and fungivore nematodes {{in the fall and}} the following spring. Greater biological activity in the soil enhanced concentrations of mineral N available to the subsequent summer tomato crop. Mineral N concentration in the spring was associated with abundance of bacterivore nema-todes, and with the corresponding Enrichment Index (EI) provided by nematode community analysis. Because environmental conditions that favour increase of bacterivore nematodes probably also favour other microbial grazers, including protozoa, the abundance of bacterivore nematodes may be an indicator of overall grazing activity and N mineralisation rates from soil fauna. Decomposition pathways in the spring, inferred from nematode bioindicators, were dominated by bacteria in plots that had been irrigated the previous fall while fungi were more prevalent in those that had not. The responses of omnivore and predator nematodes to our treatments were not consistent and {{there was no evidence that}} regulation of <b>opportunist</b> <b>species</b> by predators would be enhanced by the management practices imposed...|$|E
40|$|Populational {{biology of}} Imparfinis minutus (Siluriformes, Heptapteridae) in the Ribeirao Grande microbasin, eastern Mantiqueira {{mountain}} range, São Paulo State. The {{aim of the}} work was to analyze biological aspects and distribution of Imparfinis minutus in the Ribeirao Grande microbasin (22 [degree] 4708 [minute]''S, 45 [degree] 28 [minute] 17 ''W), in eastern Mantiqueira mountain range, from July 2001 to April 2002. Among the 37 species sampled, I. minutus (Siluriformes, Heptapteridae), was distributed from the piedmont to the plains of the Vale do Paraiba. The occurrence of this species {{was associated with the}} environments of small water volume, bottom with stones and gravel. The amplitude length of I. minutus was 4. 75 to 12. 75 cm. The length-weight relationship of the population was estimated at W = 0. 0052 L 3, 13. Analyzing the alometric (Ka) and relative (Kr) condition factors, both indexes presented similar values. The lowest value was obtained in July, increasing gradually in October and January, and peaking in April. The analysis of the gonadossomatic relationship (GSR) of females showed higher values in July and January. The reproductive period of I. minutus occurred on spring/summer (October to January), as suggested by the gonadossomatic relationship and condition factor results. Feeding activity was constant, with fat visceral deposition concentrated in April and July. Imparfinis minutus is an aquatic insectivore <b>opportunist</b> <b>species,</b> consuming Diptera and Trichoptera larvae as secondary items. Most ingested food items were autochthonous resources...|$|E

The lowland habitats of north-central Chile are characterized by thorn scrub vegetation with rainfall controlled by El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. During the ENSO cold phase, droughts prevail leading to reductions in small mammal densities and local extinction of some species. Alternatively, the ENSO warm phase brings heavy rains resulting in large population irruptions (ratadas). The objectives of this dissertation were to understand the physical and biological factors affecting small mammal population dynamics and genetic structure and to understand how species maintain regional representation. The problem was approached from three spatial and temporal scales. First, the importance of predation, competition and rainfall on extinction, colonization, incidence, and abundance were analyzed for eight years of data from an ongoing experimental manipulation at a single locality. It was demonstrated that predation and competition affected all variables, but that changes in extinction, colonization and incidence were directly related to changes in abundance. The magnitude of effect was small, however, and vaned over time and among species. For most species, rainfall was an accurate predictor of abundance and, therefore, all variables. It is argued that local carrying capacity is controlled by rainfall whereas biotic interactions affect growth rates. Second, the influence of spatial variation in habitat quality on local dynamics was studied at a regional scale. Fluctuations in small mammal numbers and reproductive activity were compared from thorn scrub, fog forest and aguada, (seeps) habitats. Species were divided into two groups based on their representation in the thorn scrub. Extinction-resistant species (core species) maintained viable populations in the thorn scrub and aguadas at all times. Extinction-prone <b>species</b> (<b>opportunists)</b> maintained primary populations in aguadas and the fog forest. The role of spatial variation in the maintenance of biodiversity was demonstrated and aguadas were shown to be important conservation units. Finally, the population genetic structure (based on mitochondrial DNA sequences) of a core species (Phyllotis darwini) was compared to that of an opportunististic one (Oligoryzomys longicaudatus). The expectation was for lower genetic diversity and higher levels of population subdivision for the opportunist. The results, however, revealed comparable levels of genetic diversity and largely congruent patterns of population subdivision related to geographic features. The data suggest that both species are more vagile than previously thought and neither conforms to preconceived notions of environmental patchiness as defined by the investigator...|$|R
40|$|The {{relatively}} new recreational pursuit of coasteering, which has {{developed in the}} St David's area of Pembrokeshire, appears to be expanding rapidly. The majority of local commercial recreation providers (outdoor pursuit centers etc.) now appear to offer this pursuit. The majority of the rocky coastlines where it takes place lie within Pembrokeshire Marine Special Area of Conservation (SAC), and are also Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). No assessment has yet been undertaken of coasteering's potential impact on the intertidal habitats. Therefore the Countryside Council for Wales (CCW) commissioned the Marine Life Information Network (MarLIN) to undertake a desk study of the likely environmental effects of coasteering on rocky intertidal habitats within the Pembrokeshire marine SAC. The desk study {{was based on a}} review of the available literature, and in particular the effects of trampling on rocky intertidal communities. Communities (as biotopes) within the Pembrokeshire marine SAC likely to be exposed to coasteering activities were identified from Phase I biotope data for the area, provided by CCW. Where possible, existing research by MarLIN into the intolerance, recoverability and sensitivity of the biotopes identified, was used to identify their potential vulnerability to trampling. The literature review revealed that: - foliose canopy forming algae (e. g. fucoids) were particularly intolerant and sensitive to trampling impacts; - trampling damaged erect coralline turfs, barnacles, and resulted in an increase in bare space; in some cases paths across the shore were visible; - on brown algae dominated shores, understorey algae could suffer due to increased desiccation but algal turf <b>species,</b> <b>opportunists</b> and gastropod grazers (e. g. limpets) could increase in abundance as an indirect effect of trampling, and that - trampling impacts resulted from physical contact and wear and were dependant on the intensity, duration, and frequency of trampling, and even the type of footwear used. A total of 19 intolerant rocky intertidal biotopes were identified as potentially vulnerable to trampling and hence coasteering within the Pembrokeshire marine SAC, of which six are of Welsh importance and eight are nationally rare or scarce. Trampling is a highly localized impact and {{it was not possible to}} identify biotopes, and hence communities, actually impacted by coasteering activities in the Pembrokeshire marine SAC. In addition, the majority of the literature addresses the impacts of trampling on wave sheltered or moderately exposed brown algal dominated shores, while coasteering occurs on more wave exposed, steeply inclined shores. Therefore, direct survey of the routes used by coasteering groups within the Pembrokeshire marine SAC is required to identify the intensity, duration and frequency of trampling impact, together with the communities impacted. Given the paucity of data concerning trampling effects in the rocky intertidal in the UK, a survey of the impacts of coasteering would provide an opportunity to examine the effects of trampling and visitor use in steep rocky, wave exposed shores. The report recognizes the potential to engage coasteerers in contributing to the development of strategies for minimizing adverse impacts, recording impacts and collecting information of use in identifying climate change and the occurrence of non-native species...|$|R
40|$|Benthic {{invertebrates}} are {{a well-established}} target in environmental quality status evaluations. The AMBI (AZTI's Marine Biotic Index) {{was developed to}} determine the impacts and the quality status of soft-bottom marine benthic communities. The {{aim of this study}} was investigating multivariate pattern of benthic invertebrate community and application of AMBI (AZTI's Marine Biotic Index) for determining quality of health status in Khuzestan coastal waters. Seasonal samplings were collected from eight creeks over one year study by Peterson grab sampler, beginning from October 2005. All creeks are characterized by muddy bottom. According to sensitivity to environmental stress, macrobenthic animals classified into 5 ecological groups. Among 28 identified faunal groups the most abundant groups were polychaets, molluscs, crustaceans and nematodes, respectively. Two way ANOVAs showed only seasonal significant differences in mean abundance (P< 0. 05) and Margalef richness index values (P< 0. 05), while all of studied creeks shows similar biological characters based on benthic communities. According to annual mean of AMBI value all creeks were in ecological group III with slightly polluted condition, except for Darvish that was in unpolluted category. In the present study, although the number of species initially increased, but due to appearance of dominant species such as Capitella sp. and nematods (as <b>opportunist</b> <b>species),</b> diversity values reduced. In general, according to AMBI and Biotic index values, the most creeks are classified into unpolluted and slightly polluted categories except for Zangy, Doragh and Patil in summer and also Zangy and Bihad in winter whic...|$|E
