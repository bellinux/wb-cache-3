5|$|In {{women with}} {{cervicitis}} (inflammation of the cervix) or vaginitis (inflammation of the vagina) and in {{young men with}} UTI symptoms, a Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrheae infection may be the cause. These infections are typically classified as a urethritis rather than a urinary tract infection. Vaginitis may also {{be due to a}} yeast infection. Interstitial cystitis (chronic pain in the bladder) may be considered for people who experience multiple episodes of UTI symptoms but urine cultures remain negative and not improved with antibiotics. Prostatitis (inflammation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prostate)</b> may also be considered in the differential diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|In case {{of failure}} with PVS, {{spermatozoa}} are sometimes collected by electroejaculation: an electrical probe is {{inserted into the}} rectum, where it triggers ejaculation. The success rate is 80–100%, but the technique requires anaesthesia and {{does not have the}} potential to be done at home that PVS has. Both PVS and electroejaculation carry a risk of autonomic dysreflexia, so drugs to prevent the condition can be given in advance and blood pressure is monitored throughout the procedures for those who are susceptible. Massage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prostate</b> gland and seminal vesicles is another method to retrieve stored sperm. If these methods fail to cause ejaculation or do not yield sufficient usable sperm, sperm can be surgically removed by testicular sperm extraction or percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration. These procedures yield sperm in 86–100% of cases, but nonsurgical treatments are preferred.|$|E

40|$|Epithelial {{proliferation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ventral <b>prostate</b> in rodents peaks between 2 and 4 {{weeks of}} age, and by week 8, proliferating cells are rare. We have used ERβ−/− and CYP 7 B 1 −/− mice to investigate <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> ERβ {{and one of}} its ligands, 5 α-androstane- 3 β, 17 β-diol (3 βAdiol), in growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ventral <b>prostate.</b> Before puberty, ERβ was found in quiescent but not in proliferating cells, and proliferating cells occurred more frequently in ventral prostates of ERβ−/− mice than in wild-type littermates. Treatment with 3 βAdiol decreased proliferation in wild-type but not in ERβ−/− mice. In rats, treatment with 3 βAdiol from postnatal day 2 to 28 resulted in reduction in growth <b>of</b> ventral <b>prostates.</b> <b>The</b> <b>prostates</b> <b>of</b> CYP 7 B 1 −/− mice were hypoproliferative before puberty and smaller than those of their wild-type littermates after puberty. Because CYP 7 B 1 represents the major pathway for inactivating 3 βAdiol in <b>the</b> <b>prostate,</b> we suggest that ERβ, 3 βAdiol, and CYP 7 B 1 are <b>the</b> components <b>of</b> a pathway that regulates growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rodent ventral <b>prostate.</b> In this pathway, ERβ is an antiproliferative receptor, 3 βAdiol is an ERβ ligand, and CYP 7 B 1 is the enzyme that regulates ERβ function by regulating <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> 3 βAdiol...|$|R
40|$|Prostate {{stem cell}} antigen (PSCA) is a GPI-anchored {{membrane}} protein whose expression is reportedly up-regulated in {{a majority of}} human prostate cancers, including advanced stages and metastases. In this study, we investigate <b>the</b> expression pattern <b>of</b> <b>the</b> murine orthologue <b>of</b> PSCA by in situ hybridization in fetal and adult mouse tissues. Murine PSCA is expressed during fetal development in the urogenital sinus, skin, and gastrointestinal tract. The expression in these tissues is restricted to the most superficial cell layer. In the adult mouse, expression is highest in <b>the</b> mucosal lining <b>of</b> <b>the</b> urinary tract. In <b>the</b> normal adult <b>prostate,</b> expression of PSCA is detected exclusively in the secretory epithelium.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether adenosine 5 ′-triphosphate (ATP) {{is involved in}} neurotransmission to <b>the</b> rat <b>prostate</b> gland. Fluorescence immunohistochemistry carried out on formaldehyde-fixed and frozen sections of rat prostate showed immunoreactivity for the P 2 X 1 -receptor in the fibromuscular stroma surrounding the secretory acini {{but not in the}} glandular epithelium. P 2 X 2 -, P 2 X 3 -, P 2 X 4 - and P 2 X 7 -receptors were immunonegative in <b>the</b> rat <b>prostate</b> stroma. Double-staining procedures showed P 2 X 1 -receptor immunoreactivity to be colocalized with α-actin immunoreactivity. Isolated organ bath studies investigated whether drugs, which modify purinergic mechanisms, are able to affect contractility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rat <b>prostate</b> gland. Suramin (100 μM) and αβmethylene ATP (10 μM) inhibited contractile responses to trains of electrical-field stimulation (70 V, 0. 5 ms, 0. 1 – 2 Hz) in the absence and presence of prazosin (300 nM). Responses to 5 – 20 Hz were unaffected by suramin or αβmethylene ATP. Exogenous application of ATP analogues to unstimulated isolated preparations of rat prostate produced concentration-dependent suramin (100 μM) sensitive transient contractions with a relative order of potency: αβmethylene ATP>βγmethylene ATP>ATP. Adenosine and adenosine 5 ′-monophosphate (AMP) did not produce contractile responses. These results suggest that P 2 X 1 -receptors for ATP, which mediate contractions are present in <b>the</b> fibromuscular stroma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rat <b>prostate.</b> <b>The</b> relative order <b>of</b> potency of ATP analogues in producing contractions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rat <b>prostate</b> is consistent with <b>the</b> activation <b>of</b> P 2 X 1 -receptors. Inhibition by suramin and αβmethylene ATP of electrically evoked nerve-mediated contractions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rat <b>prostate</b> implies that ATP contributes to this contractile response and is therefore a cotransmitter with noradrenaline during low-frequency stimulation...|$|R
25|$|HIFU for {{prostate}} cancer utilizes ultrasound to ablate/destroy the tissue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prostate.</b> During the HIFU procedure, sound waves are used to heat the prostate tissue, thus destroying the cancerous cells. In essence, ultrasonic waves are focused on specific areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prostate</b> to eliminate the prostate cancer, with minimal risks of affecting other tissue or organs. Temperatures at {{the focal point of}} the sound waves can exceed 100 °C (212 °F). However, many studies of HIFU were performed by manufacturers of HIFU devices, or members of manufacturers' advisory panels.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>prostate</b> {{is a part}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> male {{reproductive}} system that helps make and store seminal fluid. In adult men, a typical prostate is about 3 centimeters long and weighs about 20 grams. It {{is located in the}} pelvis, under the urinary bladder and in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rectum. <b>The</b> <b>prostate</b> surrounds part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder during urination and semen during ejaculation. Because of its location, prostate diseases often affect urination, ejaculation, and rarely defecation. <b>The</b> <b>prostate</b> contains many small glands which make about 20% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fluid constituting semen. In <b>prostate</b> cancer, <b>the</b> cells <b>of</b> these <b>prostate</b> glands mutate into cancer cells. <b>The</b> <b>prostate</b> glands require male hormones, known as androgens, to work properly. Androgens include testosterone, which is made in the testes; dehydroepiandrosterone, made in the adrenal glands; and dihydrotestosterone, which is converted from testosterone within <b>the</b> <b>prostate</b> itself. Androgens are also responsible for secondary sex characteristics such as facial hair and increased muscle mass.|$|R
