5|$|The methodological {{breakthroughs}} of the neurosciences, {{in particular}} the introduction of high-tech neuroimaging procedures, has propelled scientists toward the elaboration <b>of</b> <b>increasingly</b> ambitious research programs: {{one of the main}} goals is to describe and comprehend the neural processes which correspond to mental functions (see: neural correlate). Several groups are inspired by these advances.|$|E

5|$|A {{decompression}} {{schedule is}} a specified ascent rate and series <b>of</b> <b>increasingly</b> shallower decompression stops—often for {{increasing amounts of}} time—that a diver performs to outgas inert gases from their body during ascent to the surface {{to reduce the risk}} of decompression sickness. In a decompression dive, the decompression phase may make up a large part of the time spent underwater (in many cases it is longer than the actual time spent at depth).|$|E
5|$|After Asmara Moerni, Union {{produced}} a further three films; only one, Wanita dan Satria, was by Rd Ariffien, {{who left the}} company soon after, as did Saeroen. Gani did not act in any further films, but instead returned to the nationalist movement. During the Indonesian National Revolution (1945–49) he became known as a smuggler, and after independence became a government minister. In November 2007 Gani was made a National Hero of Indonesia. Djoewariah continued to act until the 1950s, when she migrated to theatre after receiving a series <b>of</b> <b>increasingly</b> minor roles.|$|E
5|$|After Wanita dan Satria, Union {{produced}} a further two films; {{none of these}} were by Rd. Ariffien, who had left the company. Saeroen likewise left soon after, joining Star Film. Djoewariah continued to act until the 1950s, when she migrated to theatre after receiving a series <b>of</b> <b>increasingly</b> minor roles. Neither Ratna Djoewita nor Hidajat appeared in any films after 1941.|$|E

5|$|Crytek {{contracted}} Ruffian Games {{to develop}} a competitive multiplayer mode for Ryse, but the feature was later cut from the final game. Despite that, a co-operative multiplayer mode was introduced, and tasked players to fight against waves <b>of</b> <b>increasingly</b> difficult human enemies. The team originally hoped to add sea battles and animals to the game, but after internal testing, these features were removed. A Xbox SmartGlass feature called the Challenge Editor was set to be introduced to the game after its launch. It allowed players to create custom challenges for the game's co-operative multiplayer. However, Crytek announced {{that the development of}} this feature had been ceased in February 2014.|$|E
5|$|Paramount {{released}} The Wrath of Khan on VHS and Beta in 1983. The studio {{sold the}} VHS for $39.95, $40 below contemporary movie cassette prices. It needed to sell 60,000 tapes {{to make the}} film as profitable as other tapes, but sold 120,000. The successful experiment was credited with instigating more competitive VHS pricing, {{an increase in the}} adoption <b>of</b> <b>increasingly</b> cheaper VHS players, and an industry-wide move away from rentals to sales as the bulk of videotape revenue.|$|E
5|$|The climate, {{and as a}} result, {{the flora}} and fauna, of Pinkham Notch varies greatly with elevation. As {{elevations}} increase {{on the walls of}} the notch, climate and ecosystems change to those <b>of</b> <b>increasingly</b> northern occurrence. Biomes range from a low-elevation northern hardwood forest at the base of Mount Washington to alpine-Arctic vegetation near the summit comparable to vegetation found at the latitude of Labrador.|$|E

5|$|The four-day {{whirlwind}} {{trip was}} launched on September 6, 1963, {{the same day}} as a National Security Council (NSC) meeting, and came in the wake <b>of</b> <b>increasingly</b> strained relations between the United States and South Vietnam. Civil unrest gripped South Vietnam as Buddhist demonstrations against the religious discrimination of President Ngô Đình Diệm's Catholic regime escalated. Following the raids on Buddhist pagodas on August 21 that left a death toll ranging up to a few hundred, the US authorized investigations into a possible coup through a cable to US Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.|$|E
5|$|The main {{improvement}} in engine performance during the pre-dreadnought period {{came from the}} adoption <b>of</b> <b>increasingly</b> higher pressure steam from the boiler. Scotch marine boilers were superseded by more compact water-tube boilers, allowing higher-pressure steam to be produced with less fuel consumption. Water-tube boilers were also safer, with less risk of explosion, and more flexible than fire-tube types. The Belleville-type water-tube boiler had been introduced in the French fleet as early as 1879, but it took until 1894 for the Royal Navy to adopt it for armoured cruisers and pre-dreadnoughts; other water-tube boilers followed in navies worldwide.|$|E

5|$|There {{is also a}} {{co-operative}} multiplayer mode, {{in which}} two players team up to accomplish various challenges and fight against waves <b>of</b> <b>increasingly</b> difficult enemies in the Roman Colosseum, a gladiator arena setting. The environments of the Colosseum change dynamically in a match to add variety to the mode. Players can gain access to increasingly advanced armor and weapons as they progress through these multiplayer matches. Microtransactions are also featured, allowing players to purchase in-game upgrades with real-life currency.|$|E
5|$|These {{problems}} {{influenced the}} British to equip ships with muzzle-loading weapons of increasing power until the 1880s. After a brief introduction of 100-pounder or 9.5-inch (240mm) smoothbore Somerset Gun, which weighed 6.5tons (6.6 t), the Admiralty introduced 7-inch (178mm) rifled guns, weighing 7tons. These {{were followed by}} a series <b>of</b> <b>increasingly</b> mammoth weapons—guns weighing 12, 25, 25, 38 and finally 81tons, with calibre increasing from 8-inch (203mm) to 16-inch (406mm).|$|E
5|$|Wagner {{completed}} Parsifal in January 1882, and {{a second}} Bayreuth Festival was held for the new opera, which premiered on 26 May. Wagner was by this time extremely ill, having suffered a series <b>of</b> <b>increasingly</b> severe angina attacks. During the sixteenth and final performance of Parsifal on 29 August, he entered the pit unseen during act 3, took the baton from conductor Hermann Levi, and led the performance to its conclusion.|$|E

5|$|When the {{division}} was {{not engaged in}} coastal-defence duties or unit training, formation-level training took the form <b>of</b> <b>increasingly</b> larger exercises. Exercise Waterloo, conducted from 14–16June 1941, was {{the largest in the}} United Kingdom to date, with ICanadian Corps counter-attacking an imagined German sea and air landing. Exercise Bumper, held from 29September to 3October, was larger still, involving 250,000 men. These exercises tended to concentrate on traffic control, communications, and logistical concerns, and were of little practical value to the infantry.|$|E
5|$|After {{expanding}} on Neuromancer {{with two}} more novels to complete the dystopic Sprawl trilogy, Gibson collaborated with Bruce Sterling on the alternate history novel The Difference Engine (1990), which became an important work of the science fiction subgenre steampunk. In the 1990s, Gibson composed the Bridge trilogy of novels, which explored the sociological developments of near-future urban environments, postindustrial society, and late capitalism. Following {{the turn of the}} century and the events of 9/11, Gibson emerged with a string <b>of</b> <b>increasingly</b> realist novels—Pattern Recognition (2003), Spook Country (2007), and Zero History (2010)—set in a roughly contemporary world. These works saw his name reach mainstream bestseller lists for the first time. His more recent novel, The Peripheral (2014), returned to a more overt engagement with technology and recognizable science fiction concerns.|$|E
5|$|Balmer was {{appointed}} an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the King's Birthday Honours on 11June 1942. On 25June he took five of No.100 Squadron's Beauforts to Port Moresby, joining two other Beauforts {{that were already}} stationed there. That night he led five aircraft from his squadron on their first bombing mission, against a Japanese ship reported in the Huon Gulf near Lae. Despite finding his bomb release gear faulty, necessitating three low-level attack runs in the face <b>of</b> <b>increasingly</b> heavy anti-aircraft fire, Balmer managed to score two hits, while his companions also successfully bombed the vessel. The ship appeared to be on fire and sinking, and the squadron received credit for its destruction at the time, but later investigation could not confirm its loss. The unit withdrew to Laverton for training and patrol work during July and August, before moving to Milne Bay to again {{take part in the}} New Guinea campaign. On 7September 1942, Balmer commanded a combined force of P-40 Kittyhawks from Nos.75 and 76 Squadrons, Bristol Beaufighters from No.30 Squadron, Hudsons from No.6 Squadron, and his own No.100 Squadron Beauforts in an assault on Japanese shipping near Milne Bay. It {{was the first time the}} Beauforts had been armed with torpedoes in combat, and they failed to score any hits.|$|E
