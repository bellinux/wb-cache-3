5|$|Animals produce colour in {{different}} ways. Pigments are particles of coloured material. Chromatophores are cells containing pigment, which can change their size {{to make their}} colour more or less visible. Some animals, including many butterflies and birds, have microscopic structures in scales, bristles or feathers which give them brilliant iridescent colours. Other animals including squid and some deep-sea fish can produce light, sometimes of different colours. Animals often use two <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> mechanisms together to produce the colours and effects they need.|$|E
5|$|As Mikawa's force {{neared the}} Guadalcanal area, the Japanese ships {{launched}} three floatplanes for one final reconnaissance of the Allied ships, {{and to provide}} illumination by dropping flares during the upcoming battle. Although several of the Allied ships heard and/or observed one <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> floatplanes, starting at 23:45 on August 8, none of them interpreted the presence of unknown aircraft in the area as an actionable threat, and no one reported the sightings to Crutchley or Turner.|$|E
5|$|On {{the basis}} of symptoms, it is {{possible}} to distinguish HSP from hypersensitivity vasculitis (HV). In a series comparing 85 HSP patients with 93 HV patients, five symptoms were found to be indicative of HSP: palpable purpura, abdominal angina, digestive tract hemorrhage (not due to intussussception), hematuria and age less than 20. The presence of three <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> indicators has an 87% sensitivity for predicting HSP.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{attractive}} themes {{of the game is}} affiliations. <b>These</b> are groupings <b>of</b> ships and personnel based on the major interstellar powers of the Star Trek universe, and decks will be based around one, <b>or</b> perhaps <b>more,</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> groups.|$|R
50|$|The U.S. {{spends more}} as a {{percentage}} of GDP than similar countries, and this can be explained either through higher prices for services themselves, higher costs to administer the system, <b>or</b> <b>more</b> utilization <b>of</b> <b>these</b> services, <b>or</b> to a combination <b>of</b> <b>these</b> elements.|$|R
5|$|Tens of {{thousands}} of galaxies have been catalogued, {{but only a few}} have well-established names, such as the Andromeda Galaxy, the Magellanic Clouds, the Whirlpool Galaxy, and the Sombrero Galaxy. Astronomers work with numbers from certain catalogues, such as the Messier catalogue, the NGC (New General Catalogue), the IC (Index Catalogue), the CGCG (Catalogue of Galaxies and of Clusters of Galaxies), the MCG (Morphological Catalogue of Galaxies) and UGC (Uppsala General Catalogue of Galaxies). All of the well-known galaxies appear in one <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> catalogues but each time under a different number.|$|E
5|$|Vitamins are {{essential}} for the normal growth and development of a multicellular organism. Using the genetic blueprint inherited from its parents, a fetus begins to develop from the nutrients it absorbs. It requires certain vitamins and minerals to be present at certain times. These nutrients facilitate the chemical reactions that produce among other things, skin, bone, and muscle. If there is serious deficiency in one <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> nutrients, a child may develop a deficiency disease. Even minor deficiencies may cause permanent damage.|$|E
5|$|Isopods are detritivores, browsers, {{carnivores}} (including {{predators and}} scavengers), parasites, and filter feeders, and may occupy one <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> feeding niches. Only aquatic and marine species {{are known to}} be parasites or filter feeders. Some exhibit coprophagia and will also consume their own fecal pellets. Terrestrial species are in general herbivorous, with woodlice feeding on moss, bark, algae, fungi and decaying material. In marine isopods that feed on wood, cellulose is digested by enzymes secreted in the caeca. Limnoria lignorum, for example, bores into wood and additionally feeds on the mycelia of fungi attacking the timber, thus increasing the nitrogen in its diet. Land-based wood-borers mostly house symbiotic bacteria in the hindgut which aid in digesting cellulose. There are numerous adaptations to this simple gut, but these are mostly correlated with diet rather than by taxonomic group.|$|E

5000|$|... {{there were}} 39 {{apartment}}s in the village. The most common apartment size was 5 rooms {{of which there}} were 10.

5|$|The pre-Columbian Maya civilization {{developed}} and used an intricate and fully functional writing system, {{which is the}} only Mesoamerican script that can be said to be almost fully deciphered. Earlier-established civilizations to the west and north of the Maya homelands that also had scripts recorded in surviving inscriptions include the Zapotec, Olmec, and the Zoque-speaking peoples of the southern Veracruz and western Chiapas areaâ€”but their scripts are as yet largely undeciphered. It is generally agreed that the Maya writing system was adapted from one <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> earlier systems. A number of references identify the undeciphered Olmec script as its most likely precursor.|$|E
5|$|Within a {{few years}} of the end of World War II, the United States {{deactivated}} all of its remaining battleships and placed them in the United States Navy reserve fleets. Most of these ships were eventually scrapped, but the four Iowa-class battleships were not, and on several occasions one <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> four battleships were reactivated for naval gunfire support. The U.S. Navy has held onto the four Iowa-class battleships long after the upkeep and maintenance of operating and maintaining a battleship and the arrival of aircraft and precision guided munitions led other nations to scrap their big-gun fleets. Congress was largely responsible for keeping the four Iowa-class battleships in the United States Navy reserve fleets and on the Naval Vessel Register as long as they did. The lawmakers argued that the battleships' large-caliber guns had a useful destructive power that is lacking in the smaller, cheaper, and faster guns mounted by U.S. cruisers and destroyers.|$|E

25|$|Studies {{involving}} {{twins have}} shown that schizophrenia is a heritable disease. While no one gene {{is responsible for the}} disease, a large number of possible genes have been identified.

25|$|Typically half <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> snails {{were buried}} in the sediments and were not visible from the surface.

There is also not known how long can snails remain buried.|$|E
25|$|Each file may occupy one <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> {{clusters}} {{depending on}} its size; thus, a file {{is represented by}} a chain of these clusters (referred to as a singly linked list). However these clusters are not necessarily stored adjacent to one another on the disk's surface but are often instead fragmented throughout the Data Region.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the problem}} of testing whether a graph is class 1 is NP-complete, there is no known {{polynomial}} time algorithm for edge-coloring every graph with an optimal number of colors. Nevertheless, a number of algorithms have been developed that relax one <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> criteria: they only work on a subset of graphs, or they do not always use an optimal number of colors, or they do not always run in polynomial time.|$|E

25|$|Mechanical filter {{respirators}} retain {{particulate matter}} such as dust created during woodworking or metal processing, when contaminated air is {{passed through the}} filter material. Wool is still used today as a filter, along with plastic, glass, cellulose, and combinations of two <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> materials. Since the filters cannot be cleaned and reused and have a limited lifespan, cost and disposability are key factors. Single-use, disposable and replaceable cartridge models exist.|$|E
25|$|The tower saddle {{includes}} eyebars for {{the attachment}} of temporary cables that supported four walkways, each a simple suspension bridge (called a catwalk) that allowed {{access to the}} cable spinning mechanism and the main cable during construction. In several ways similar to a ski lift, additional superior cables carried one <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> travelers, wheeled devices that shuttled {{from one end of}} the span to the other, pulled by drafting cables manipulated by several winches.|$|E
