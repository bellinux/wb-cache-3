40|$|We {{show that}} many widely {{deployed}} email encryption systems reveal {{the identities of}} Blind-Carbon-Copy (BCC) recipients. For example, encrypted email sent using Microsoft <b>Outlook</b> <b>completely</b> exposes the identity of every BCC recipient. Additionally, several implementations of PGP expose the full name and email address of BCC recipients. In this paper, we present a number of methods for providing BCC privacy while preserving the existing semantics of email. Our constructions use standard public key systems such as RSA and ElGamal and suggest that BCC privacy can be implemented efficiently without changing the underlying broadcast semantics of the email system...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} burns and scalds in {{children}} has been materially altered {{during the past}} five or six years by the fact that human plasma and serum have become available for treatment. This means not only that many lives can now be saved which previously were lost, but also that new problem, arise from the survival of children with serious and extensive lesions. In short, resuscitation has so advanced beyond other aspects of therapy {{that it is possible to}} keep alive for several weeks or months children who stand little chance of ultimate recovery. The assessment of this chance of recovery and the decision that must be taken at the very beginning as to whether or not resuscitation should be attempted, is often very difficult. It appears that, with only ordinary hospital facilities availabld, cases with lesions affecting more than 40 per cent. of the body surface do not survive beyond a few weeks; with specially equipped units this could almost certainly be improved upon (Bourdillon and Colebrook, 1946). On the other hand, small children can die from fluid loss when the local lesion is neither deep nor extensive, and in this type of case plasma therapy has altered the <b>outlook</b> <b>completely.</b> There is no need now for any child over the age of one year to die from a lesion involving less than 30 per cent. of the body surface. The following study was undertaken in the hope of obtaining a better understanding of the problems that arise during the routine hospital treatment of burned and scalded children, and to determine the most reliable criteria for its guidance...|$|E
40|$|Family {{planning}} {{was introduced}} in Zimbabwe as a voluntary movement in the 1950 s. Volunteers formed a Family Planning Association in the mid- 1960 s. The government became interested in family planning in the late 1960 s after analysis of the 1961 population census. It gave the Family Planning Association an annual grant, allowed contraceptives to be available through Ministry of Health facilities, and allowed nonmedical personnel to initiate and resupply family planning clients with condoms and pills. But before Zimbabwe achieved independence in 1980, family planning was viewed with great suspicion by the black majority, so the program's effectiveness {{was limited to the}} urban few. A new era began after independence. The new government took over theFamily Planning Association and changed its <b>outlook</b> <b>completely.</b> Through government and international donor support, the family planning program was restructured and expanded. The number of family planning personnel more than doubled in some units. More service delivery points were set up - particularly in rural areas. And the information, education, and communication and evaluation and research units were established. Through a World Bank-assisted project (with grant funding from Norway and Denmark), the Ministry of Health began strengthening its family planning capabilities. These efforts helped increase the contraceptive prevalence rate from about 14 percent in 1982 to 43 percent in 1988. But the program's growth is beginning to stall. More effort and resources are needed if the program is to grow or even maintain its present status. Particularly important are the following: designing innovative strategies to reach hard-to-reach populations; giving more emphasis to information, education, and communication, especially for men and youths, using multimedia; involving other sectors in the delivery of family planning services; broadening the mix of contraceptive methods (especially promoting long-term and permanent methods); making use of alternative family planning delivery systems, {{such as the use of}} depot holders, volunteers, and government extension workers; establishing a national population policy; and considering cost recovery and other measures for self-sustainment and program growth.

50|$|The {{economic}} <b>outlook</b> was <b>completely</b> {{different from}} that of the 1990s ds. The devalued peso made Argentine exports cheap and competitive abroad and discouraged imports. In addition, the high price of soybeans in the international market produced massive amounts of foreign currency; China became a major buyer of Argentina's soy products.|$|R
50|$|In 1993, another {{monument}} {{that looks}} alike {{the original version}} was erected at the same place. However, its <b>outlook</b> is not <b>completely</b> authentic: there is no metal fence around it, no canons, and the fountain has also not been restored in its original form.|$|R
50|$|The University campus at Meerut {{is set on}} the Delhi-Meerut-Dehradun National Highway (NH-58). The University is unmistakably modern in both {{appearance}} and <b>outlook.</b> As a <b>completely</b> purpose built development, the campus is more compact than most, with all major facilities easily accessible from a central parade. Laboratories and lecture theaters are all grouped around this area and are interspersed with accommodation blocks.|$|R
5000|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief that the {{division}} of the human species based on physical variations is natural, there exists no clear, reliable distinctions that bind people to such groupings. According to the American Anthropological Association, [...] "Evidence from the analysis of genetics (e.g., DNA) indicates that most physical variation, about 94%, lies within so-called racial groups. Conventional geographic [...] "racial" [...] groupings differ from one another only in about 6% of their genes." [...] While there is a biological basis for differences in human phenotypes, most notably in skin color, the genetic variability of humans is found not amongst, but rather within racial groups - meaning the perceived level of dissimilarity amongst the species has virtually no biological basis. Genetic diversity has characterized human survival, rendering the idea of a [...] "pure" [...] ancestry as obsolete. Under this interpretation, race is conceptualized through a lens of artificiality, rather than through the skeleton of a scientific discovery. As a result, scholars have begun to broaden discourses of race by defining it as a social construct and exploring the historical contexts that led to its inception and persistence in contemporary society. This <b>outlook</b> is <b>completely</b> disregarded in the hard sciences as evidence of the anti-science left's dominance in anthropology and other social sciences.|$|R
50|$|At {{the age of}} 12, Tan Sitong {{lost his}} mother, his eldest brother and his second eldest sister, who died one after another within a span of 5 days due to {{diphtheria}} contracted {{from one of his}} cousins when they went to visit her. He himself also fell gravely ill and only recovered three days later, which was deemed to be a miracle. This event struck him so much that his <b>outlook</b> on life <b>completely</b> changed. After Tan Sitong lost his mother, his father’s concubine treated him badly. He was married to Li Run (李闰) at the age of 19 and together had a son named Tan Lansheng (谭兰生), who died within a year. His wife was known to be extremely devoted to him even years after his execution. She established a special school for girls in his hometown. Schools dedicated to the education of girls/women were almost unheard of at that time in rural China.|$|R
5000|$|The Hilltop Youth are a [...] "loosely organized, anarchy-minded group", of some {{several hundred}} youths around a hard core {{of scores of}} violent activists often noted for {{establishing}} illegal/disputed outposts outside existing settlements. Their numbers (2009) {{are estimated to be}} around 800, with approximately 5,000 others who share their ideological <b>outlook.</b> They <b>completely</b> dissociate themselves from Israeli institutions, and identify themselves with the Land of Israel. In their view, those who support Israel are [...] "Erev Rav", meaning they have the appearance of being Jews, but are in fact endowed with the souls of Gentiles, who are the enemy. They settle on hilltops in areas densely crowded by Palestinians. Members linked to the group have been accused of engaging in Israeli settler violence, including vandalism of Palestinian schools and mosques, the rustling of sheep from Palestinian flocks and the extirpation of their centuries-old olive groves, or stealing their olive harvests. This last practice was endorsed by Rabbi Mordechai Eliyahu on a visit to a hilltop outpost, Havat Gilad, where he issued a rabbinical ruling that, [...] "The ground on which the trees are planted is the inheritance of the Jewish people, and the fruit of the plantings was seeded by the goyim in land that is not theirs." [...] They seize land not by any official method: they claim a hilltop by setting up an encampment, and then claim the land nearby, whether under Palestinian cultivation or not, or by uprooting Palestinian trees and shooting in the air if any Palestinian comes near to the new outpost.|$|R
2500|$|Build 4015 (build date of March 28, 2003) {{was leaked}} to the Internet on April 28, 2003. A number of {{features}} Microsoft {{had been working on}} were rolled into this build, such as a range of parental controls, also moved and enlarged the Windows logo to {{the left side of the}} Start button a lot of additional configurability for the sidebar (including being able to put it below the start bar at the bottom of the screen), and the notion of [...] "Libraries" [...] (later known as virtual folders) of files. These libraries collected content from around the hard drive. The user could then filter this content and save it in a folder. Microsoft had originally intended to replace all special shell folders (My Documents, My Music, etc.) with virtual folders. However, this change was deemed too drastic and was dropped after Beta 1's release in mid-2005. Libraries were later included in Windows 7. This build was also notable for the debut of the boot screen progress bar that is seen in the final release (though 4015's version was blue, not green). A new Download Manager shell location suggested that Internet Explorer would get a Mozilla-style download manager, though no such functionality was apparent. Significant memory leak problems with Windows Explorer and the Sidebar made this build difficult to use, which resulted in some third-party hacks to mitigate the problem. The back-end database of <b>Outlook</b> Express changed <b>completely,</b> and became dependent on WinFS to store its email. WinFS itself still had significant performance and memory usage issues, and so it became common for testers to disable WinFS entirely, thus rendering Outlook Express inoperative.|$|R
