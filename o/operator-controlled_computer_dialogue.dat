40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the question of}} how speakers adapttheir language when they interact with a spoken dialoguesystem. In human 9 ÃÜ 6 human dialogue, people continuously adaptto their conversational partners at different levels. Wheninteracting with computers, speakers also to some extent adapttheir language to meet (what they believe to be) theconstraints of the dialogue system. Furthermore, if a problemoccurs in the human 9 ÃÜ 6 <b>computer</b> <b>dialogue,</b> patterns oflinguistic adaptation are often accentuated. In this thesis, we used an empirical approach in which aseries of corpora of human 9 ÃÜ 6 computer interaction werecollected and analyzed. The systems used for data collectionincluded both fully functional stand-alone systems in publicsettings, and simulated systems in controlled laboratoryenvironments. All of the systems featured animated talkingagents, and encouraged users to interact using unrestrictedspontaneous language. Linguistic adaptation in the corpora wasexamined at the phonetic, prosodic, lexical, syntactic andpragmatic levels. Knowledge about users 9 ÃÜ 2 linguistic adaptations can beuseful in the development of spoken dialogue systems. If we areable to adequately describe their patterns of occurrence (atthe different linguistic levels at which they occur), we willbe able to build more precise user models, thus improvingsystem performance. Our knowledge of linguistic adaptations canbe useful in at least two ways: first, it has been shown thatlinguistic adaptations can be used to identify (andsubsequently repair) errors in human 9 ÃÜ 6 <b>computer</b> <b>dialogue.</b> Second, we can try to subtly influence users to behave in acertain way, for instance by implicitly encouraging a speakingstyle that improves speech recognition performance.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{functional}} approach {{to overcome the}} lack of expressiveness of predicative approaches for extensional reference resolution.

We hypothesize that although more sophisticated linguistic features are harder to obtain, they will yield stronger learning models. We train and test our models on 3 different train/test dataset pairs derived from our 3 spoken dialogue tutoring system corpora. Our results show that more sophisticated linguistic features usually perform better than either a baseline model containing only pretest score or a model containing only surface features, and that semantic features generalize better than other linguistic feature sets...|$|R

40|$|To {{understand}} the language we use, we sometimes must turn language on itself, {{and we do}} this through {{an understanding of the}} use-mention distinction. In particular, we are able to recognize mentioned language: that is, tokens (e. g., words, phrases, sentences, letters, symbols, sounds) produced to draw attention to linguistic properties that they possess. Evidence suggests that humans frequently employ the use-mention distinction, and we would be severely handicapped without it; mentioned language frequently occurs for the introduction of new words, attribution of statements, explanation of meaning, and assignment of names. Moreover, just as we benefit from mutual recognition of the use-mention distinction, the potential exists for us to benefit from language technologies that recognize it as well.
