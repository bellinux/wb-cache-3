40|$|Sir 2 p, Sir 3 p, Sir 4 p, and {{the core}} histones form a repressive {{chromatin}} structure that silences transcription {{in the regions}} near telomeres and at the HML and HMR cryptic mating-type loci in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Null alleles of SAS 4 and SAS 5 suppress silencing defects at HMR; therefore, SAS 4 and SAS 5 are negative regulators <b>of</b> <b>silencing</b> at HMR. This study revealed that SAS 4 and SAS 5 contribute to silencing at HML and the telomeres, indicating that SAS 4 and SAS 5 are positive regulators <b>of</b> <b>silencing</b> at these loci. These paradoxical locus-specific phenotypes are shared with null alleles of SAS 2 and are unique among phenotypes of mutations in other known regulators <b>of</b> <b>silencing.</b> This work also determined that these SAS genes play roles that are redundant with SIR 1 at HML, yet distinct from SIR 1 at HMR. Furthermore, these SAS genes are not redundant {{with each other in}} silencing HML. Collectively, these data suggest that SAS 2, SAS 4, and SAS 5 constitute a novel class <b>of</b> regulators <b>of</b> <b>silencing</b> and reveal fundamental differences in the regulation <b>of</b> <b>silencing</b> at HML and HMR. We provide evidence for a model that accounts for the observation that these SAS genes are both positive and negative regulators <b>of</b> <b>silencing...</b>|$|R

40|$|In Drosophila, {{heterochromatin}} causes mosaic <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> euchromatic genes brought {{next to it}} by chromosomal rearrangements. Silencing {{has been}} observed to "spread": genes closer to the heterochromatic rearrangement breakpoint are silenced more frequently than genes farther away. We have examined <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> the white and roughest genes in the variegating rearrangements In(1) w(m 4), In(1) w(mMc), and In(1) w(m 51 b). Eleven stocks bearing these chromosomes differ widely in the strength <b>of</b> <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> white and roughest. Stock-specific differences in the relative frequencies of inactivation of white and roughest were found that map to the white-roughest region or the adjacent heterochromatin. Most stock-specific differences did not correlate with gross differences in the heterochromatic content of the rearranged chromosomes; however, two stocks, In(1) w(m 51 b) and In(1) w(mMc), {{were found to have}} anomalous additional heterochromatin that may act in trans to suppress variegating alleles. In comparing different stocks, the frequency <b>of</b> <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> the roughest gene, which is more distant from heterochromatin, does not correlate with the frequency <b>of</b> <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> the more proximal white gene on the same chromosome, in contradiction to the expectation of models of continuous linear propagation <b>of</b> <b>silencing.</b> We frequently observed rough eye tissue that is pigmented, as though an active white gene is skipped...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{show that}} {{sterility}} is an aging-specific phenotype in S. cerevisiae and, by genetic and physical means, demonstrate that this phenotype {{results from a}} loss <b>of</b> <b>silencing</b> in most old cells by the SIR complex at the HM loci. This loss <b>of</b> <b>silencing</b> is specific because transcription of genes, such as MEI 4 and DCM 1, normally induced by sporulation, is not observed, while transcription of HMRa is observed. These findings pinpoint the molecular cause of an aging-specific phenotype in yeast. Further, they provide direct evidence for a breakdown <b>of</b> <b>silencing</b> in old cells, as predicted from earlier findings that SIR 4 is a determinant of life span in this organism...|$|R

50|$|In 2006, {{researchers}} {{working on}} <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> apolipoprotein B(ApoB) in non-human primates achieved 90% silencing {{with a single}} dose of 2.5 mg/kg of SNALP-delivered APOB-specific siRNA. ApoB is a protein involved with the assembly and secretion of very-low-density lipoprotein(VLDL) and low-density lipoprotein(LDL), and it is expressed primarily in the liver and jejunum. Both VLDL and LDL are important in cholesterol transport and its metabolism. Not only was this degree <b>of</b> <b>silencing</b> observed very quickly, in about 24 hours post-administration, but the silencing effects maintained for over 22 days after only a single dose. Researchers tested a 1 mg/kg single dose, too, obtaining a 68% <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> the target gene, indicating dose-dependent silencing. This dose-dependent silencing was evident {{not only on the}} degree <b>of</b> <b>silencing</b> but the duration <b>of</b> <b>silencing,</b> expression <b>of</b> the target gene recovering 72 hours post-administration.|$|R

40|$|The {{establishment}} <b>of</b> <b>silencing</b> in Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{is similar}} to heterochromatin formation in multi-cellular eukaryotes. Previous batch culture studies determined that the de novo establishment <b>of</b> <b>silencing</b> initiates during S phase and continues for up to 5 cell divisions for completion. To track silencing phenotypically, we developed an assay that introduces Sir 3 protein into individual sir 3 Δ mutant cells synchronously and then detects the onset <b>of</b> <b>silencing</b> with single-cell resolution. Silencing was completed within {{the first one to}} two cell divisions in most cells queried. Moreover, we uncovered unexpected complexity in the contributions of a histone acetyltransferase (Sas 2), two histone methytransferases (Dot 1 and Set 1), and one histone demethylase (Jhd 2) to the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>silencing.</b> Our findings revealed that removal of methyl modifications at H 3 K 4 and H 3 K 79 were important steps in silent chromatin formation, and that Jhd 2 and Set 1 played competing roles in the process...|$|R

40|$|In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, {{silencing}} at the HM loci {{depends on}} Sir proteins, which are structural components <b>of</b> <b>silenced</b> chromatin. To explore {{the structure and}} assembly <b>of</b> <b>silenced</b> chromatin, the associations of Sir proteins with sequences across the HMR locus were examined by chromatin immunoprecipitation. In wild-type cells, Sir 2 p, Sir 3 p, and Sir 4 p were spread throughout and coincident with the silenced region at HMR. Sir 1 p, in contrast, associated only with the HMR-E silencer, consistent with its role in establishment but not maintenance <b>of</b> <b>silencing.</b> Sir 4 p was required for the association of other Sir proteins with silencers. In contrast, {{in the absence of}} Sir 2 p or Sir 3 p, partial assemblies of Sir proteins could form at silencers, where Sir protein assembly began. Spreading across HMR required Sir 2 p and Sir 3 p, as well as the deacetylase activity of Sir 2 p. These data support a model for the spreading <b>of</b> <b>silenced</b> chromatin involving cycles of nucleosome deacetylation by Sir 2 p followed by recruitment of additional Sir 2 p, Sir 3 p, and Sir 4 p to the newly deacetylated nucleosome. This model suggests mechanisms for boundary formation, and for maintenance and inheritance <b>of</b> <b>silenced</b> chromatin. The principles are generalizable to other types of heritable chromatin states...|$|R

40|$|Citrus {{tristeza}} virus (CTV), a plus-sense ssRNA virus, is {{member of}} the genus Closterovirus, family Closteroviridae. RNA viruses are inducers as-well-as targets <b>of</b> gene <b>silencing</b> defense mechanism <b>of</b> host plants {{and this has been}} exploited as a tool in functional genomics. CTV was developed into virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) or RNA-interference (RNAi) vector, which interferes with expression of endogenous genes in citrus or GFP-transgene in Nicotiana benthamiana (16 c) in a sequence specific manner. Photobleaching phenotype indicative <b>of</b> <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> endogenous gene, phytoene desaturase in citrus, and red color under UV indicative <b>of</b> <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> transgene GFP in N. benthamiana (16 c) was observed using CTV-RNAi vector.

40|$|Abstract Background PTGS (post-transcriptional gene silencing) is used {{to counter}} {{pathogenic}} invasions, particularly viruses. In return, many plant viruses produce proteins which suppress silencing directed against their RNA. The diversity <b>of</b> <b>silencing</b> suppression at the species level in natural hosts is unknown. Results We investigated the functional diversity <b>of</b> <b>silencing</b> suppression among isolates of the African RYMV (Rice yellow mottle virus) in rice. The RYMV-P 1 protein is responsible for cell-to-cell movement and is a silencing suppressor. Transgenic gus -silencing rice lines were used to investigate intra-specific and serogroup silencing suppression diversity at two different levels: that of the virion and the P 1 silencing suppressor protein. Our data provide evidence that silencing suppression is a universal phenomenon for RYMV species. However, we found considerable diversity {{in their ability to}} suppress silencing which was not linked to RYMV phylogeny, or pathogenicity. At the level <b>of</b> the <b>silencing</b> suppressor P 1 alone, we found similar results to those previously found at the virion level. In addition, we showed that cell-to-cell movement of P 1 was crucial for the efficiency <b>of</b> <b>silencing</b> suppression. Mutagenesis <b>of</b> P 1 demonstrated a strong link between some amino acids and silencing suppression features with, one on the hand, the conserved amino acids C 95 and C 64 involved in cell-to-cell movement and the strength of suppression, respectively, and on the other hand, the non conserved F 88 was involved in the strength <b>of</b> <b>silencing</b> suppression. Conclusion We demonstrated that intra-species diversity <b>of</b> <b>silencing</b> suppression is highly variable and by mutagenesis of P 1 we established the first link between silencing suppression and genetic diversity. These results are potentially important for understanding virus-host interactions. </p...|$|R

Factors influencing the level <b>of</b> <b>silencing</b> in potato are discussed, with emphasis on inhibition of the granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI) gene. Type of construct, number of integrated T-DNA copies, structural arrangement of the T-DNA locus, integration site, target tissue and genetic background are important factors for all plant species.

40|$|Transgenic tobacco {{plants that}} overproduce {{luciferase}} (Luc) frequently exhibit post-transcriptional gene <b>silencing</b> (PTGS) <b>of</b> luc. The <b>silencing</b> was observed over five generations and found {{not to be}} inherited but acquired by the next generation at a certain frequency.

The luc gene expression has been recovered from <b>silencing</b> before development <b>of</b> germ cells, excluding a possible recovery from the PTGS at meiosis. A systemic silencing signal transferred from older tissue likely induces gene <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> younger tissues in which cell proliferation has been completed. Only seeds maintained Luc activity, probably because of isolation from the silencing signal by a possible partition from the parent placenta. Calli newly induced from the leaf pieces <b>of</b> <b>silenced</b> plants recovered from the silencing and exhibited strong Luc activity similar to nonsilenced leaves, further indicating that the silencing cannot be maintained in proliferating cells.
