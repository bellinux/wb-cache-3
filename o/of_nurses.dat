5|$|By {{the time}} the Nurse Training Act was passed by {{congress}} in 1943, the U.S. {{had been involved in}} World War II for nearly two years, and a serious shortage <b>of</b> <b>nurses</b> already existed at home and abroad.|$|E

5|$|Henry Whitney Bellows {{determined}} {{to take a}} different approach, establishing a civilian organization <b>of</b> <b>nurses</b> separate from the U.S. Army. Bellows was the founder of the United States Sanitary Commission and served as its only president. An influential minister, born and raised in Boston, Bellows went to Washington in May 1861 as head of a delegation of physicians representing the Women's Central Relief Association of New York and other organizations. Bellows's aim was to convince the government to establish a civilian auxiliary branch of the Army Medical Bureau. The Sanitary Commission, established by President Lincoln on June 13, 1861, provided nurses (mostly female) with medical supplies and organized hospital ships and soldiers' homes.|$|E
5|$|In the {{subsequent}} fiscal years 1941 and 1942, {{the federal government}} partially funded the education of 12,000 students at 309 nursing schools. Through that initiative, 3,800 inactive nurses received refresher courses and 4,800 graduated nurses received postgraduate training. By the end of 1942, 47,500 students were enrolled in nursing schools {{but that did not}} meet the country's need. At this point, it was clear that nurses could not be trained quickly enough to keep abreast of both civilian and military needs. The need for additional federal aid for the recruitment <b>of</b> <b>nurses</b> became apparent when the U.S. Army and Navy called for 2,500 new nurses each month during the fiscal year 1943.|$|E

5|$|Many {{thousands}} of troops from all the countries involved were drafted to the area, and disease broke out almost immediately. Hundreds perished, mostly from cholera. Hundreds more would die waiting to be shipped out, or on the voyage. Their prospects were little better {{when they arrived at}} the poorly staffed, unsanitary and overcrowded hospitals which were the only medical provision for the wounded. In Britain, a trenchant letter in The Times on 14 October triggered Sidney Herbert, Secretary of State for War, to approach Florence Nightingale to form a detachment <b>of</b> <b>nurses</b> to be sent to the hospital to save lives. Interviews were quickly held, suitable candidates selected, and Nightingale left for Turkey on 21 October.|$|E
5|$|The case drew {{international}} attention and criticism, with organizations including the United Nations, the World Medical Association, Médecins Sans Frontières, the International Council <b>of</b> <b>Nurses,</b> Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch expressing their {{concern over the}} health workers' military trials and sentences.

5|$|After their marriage, Prince Andrew {{continued}} {{his career in}} the military and Princess Andrew became involved in charity work. In 1908, she visited Russia for the wedding of Grand Duchess Marie of Russia and Prince William of Sweden. While there, she talked with her aunt, Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna, who was formulating plans for the foundation of a religious order <b>of</b> <b>nurses.</b> Princess Andrew attended the laying of the foundation stone for her aunt's new church. Later in the year, the Grand Duchess began giving away all her possessions in preparation for a more spiritual life. On their return to Greece, Prince and Princess Andrew found the political situation worsening, as the Athens government had refused to support the Cretan parliament, which had called for the union of Crete (still nominally part of the Ottoman Empire) with the Greek mainland. A group of dissatisfied officers formed a Greek nationalist Military League that eventually led to Prince Andrew's resignation from the army and the rise to power of Eleftherios Venizelos.|$|E

5|$|Bulgaria has a {{universal}} healthcare system financed by taxes and contributions. The National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) pays a gradually increasing {{portion of the}} costs of primary healthcare. Projected healthcare expenditures for 2013 amount to 4.1 percent of GDP. The number of doctors is above the EU average with 181 physicians per 100,000 people, but distribution by fields of practice is uneven, there is a severe shortage <b>of</b> <b>nurses</b> and other medical personnel, and the quality of most medical facilities is poor. Personnel shortages in some fields are so severe that patients resort to seeking treatment in neighboring countries. Bulgaria ranks 121st globally by average life expectancy, which stands at 74.5 years for both genders. The primary causes of death are similar to those in other industrialised countries, mainly cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms and respiratory diseases.|$|E
5|$|When the United States entered World War II, the {{military}} was in need <b>of</b> <b>nurses.</b> Hispanic female nurses wanted to volunteer for service, however they were not accepted into the Army Nurse Corps or Navy Nurse Corps. As a result, many women {{went to work in}} the factories which produced military equipment. As more Hispanic men joined the armed forces, a need for bilingual nurses became apparent and the Army started to recruit Hispanic nurses. In 1944, the Army Nurse Corps (ANC) decided to accept Puerto Rican nurses. Thirteen women submitted applications, were interviewed, underwent physical examinations, and were accepted into the ANC. Eight of these nurses were assigned to the Army Post at San Juan, Puerto Rico where they were valued for their bilingual abilities. Five nurses were assigned to work at the hospital at Camp Tortuguero in Puerto Rico. One of these nurses was Second Lieutenant Carmen Lozano Dumler.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{outlines}} the development <b>of</b> <b>nursing</b> through the historical influences on nursing practice, and discusses the concepts <b>of</b> <b>nursing</b> knowledge and nursing theory. Nursing {{is both an}} art and a science, a knowledge-based profession playing {{a vital role in}} health care. The practice <b>of</b> <b>nursing</b> {{has come a long way}} in the last 200 years and nurses today think, behave and practice very differently to their 19 th century counterparts. The essence <b>of</b> <b>nursing</b> has always been and continues to be about helping people. Virginia Henderson's 1960 definition <b>of</b> <b>nursing</b> highlighted this concept of helping people to recover from illness or reach a peaceful death. Henderson's definition <b>of</b> <b>nursing</b> is still the most widely used, although it has been expanded to include the concept of clinical judgment (Royal College <b>of</b> <b>Nursing,</b> 2003). Many concepts and theories have been proposed to explain the underpinnings of the practice <b>of</b> <b>nursing.</b> This chapter brings together an overview of the development <b>of</b> <b>nursing</b> and nursing knowledge and outlines nursing theories that form the basis <b>of</b> <b>nursing</b> care delivery to patients and their families.
