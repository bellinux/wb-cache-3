5000|$|Suberites display {{neuronal}} communications, but {{neuronal networks}} are mysteriously missing. However, {{they do have}} {{many of the same}} receptors and signals found in higher animals. Researchers in China and Germany have found that sponge spicules contribute to their neural communication. In effect, the siliaceous structures act as fiber optic cables to convey light signals generated from the protein luciferase. The sponges generate light from luciferin, after it is acted upon by luciferase. Suberites have also been shown to produce light in response to tactile stimulation. Suberites consist mostly of cells, in contrast with other Porifera (such as the class Hexactinellida) which are synctial. As a result, Suberites have slower reaction times in their neural communication. Suberites utilized many Ras-like GTPases which are used for signaling and affect development. According to comparative studies, Suberites have some of the most simple indicator proteins, such as collagen, of known animals. Like all sponges, Suberites are filter-feeders.

We analyze and optimize the water-energy nexus over the objectives of {{water footprint}} minimization, maximization of economic output per liter of water consumed (economic efficiency of water), and maximization of energy output per liter of water consumed (energy efficiency of water). A mixed integer, multiobjective nonlinear fractional programming (MINLFP) model is formulated. A mixed integer linear programing (MILP) -based branch and refine algorithm that incorporates both the parametric algorithm and nonlinear programming (NLP) subproblems is developed to boost solving efficiency. A case study in bioenergy is presented, and the water footprint is considered from biomass cultivation to biofuel production, providing a novel perspective into the consumption of water throughout the value chain. The case study, optimized successively over the three aforementioned objectives, utilizes a variety of candidate biomass feedstocks to meet primary fuel products demand (ethanol, diesel, and gasoline). A minimum water footprint of 55. 1 ML/year was found, economic efficiencies of water range from −$ 1. 31 /L to $ 0. 76 /L, and energy efficiencies of water ranged from 15. 32 MJ/L to 27. 98 MJ/L. These results show optimization provides avenues for process improvement, as reported values for the energy efficiency of bioethanol range from 0. 62 MJ/L to 3. 18 MJ/L.

40|$|Little {{consideration}} {{has been}} given to environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling strategies for rare species. The certainty of species detection relies on understanding false positive and false negative error rates. We used artificial ponds together with logistic regression models to assess the detection of African jewelfish eDNA at varying fish densities (0, 0. 32, 1. 75, and 5. 25 fish/m 3). Our objectives were to determine the most effective water stratum for eDNA detection, estimate true and false positive eDNA detection rates, and assess the number of water samples necessary to minimize the risk of false negatives. There were 28 eDNA detections in 324, 1 -L, water samples collected from four experimental ponds. The best-approximating model indicated that the per-L-sample probability of eDNA detection was 4. 86 times more likely for every 2. 53 fish/m 3 (1 SD) increase in fish density and 1. 67 times less likely for every 1. 02 C (1 SD) increase in water temperature. The best section of the water column to detect eDNA was the surface {{and to a lesser extent}} the bottom. Although no false positives were detected, the estimated likely number of false positives in samples from ponds that contained fish averaged 3. 62. At high densities of African jewelfish, 3 - 5 L of water provided a > 95 % probability for the presence/absence of its eDNA. Conversely, at moderate and low densities, the number of water samples necessary to achieve a > 95 % probability of eDNA detection approximated 42 - 73 and > 100 L, respectively. Potential biases associated with incomplete detection of eDNA could be alleviated via formal estimation of eDNA detection probabilities under an occupancy modeling framework; alternatively, the filtration of hundreds <b>of</b> <b>liters</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> may be required to achieve a high (e. g., 95 %) level of certainty that African jewelfish eDNA will be detected at low densities (i. e., < 0. 32 fish/m 3 or 1. 75 g/m 3) ...|$|E
40|$|Passive {{sampling}} {{is a novel}} {{method of}} analyte concentration from the environment that strives to bring greater ease to field sampling regimes than traditional liquid-solid phase extractions (SPE). It is easier to deploy than a Niskin bottle or CTD rosette, and easier to recover than hoisting up dozens <b>of</b> <b>liters</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> Passive sampling also offers the opportunity for wider exploratory studies, as compounds can be selectively extracted back in lab, {{rather than having to}} select a particular phase SPE and follow phase-specific elution methods. In this study, Ethylene Vinyl Acetate copolymer (EVA) was used as a marine sorption and collection media. Its efficacy was tested in both ambient munitions sampling for TNT and RDX, and for sulfate in porewaters. For the munitions subset of samples, the interaction between salinity, temperature, and percent acetate composition of the EVA samplers was explored. It was found that salinity had a large increase on Log KEVA from 0 - 5 PSU, then became nonlinear from 5 - 34 PSU. The initial increase was present for all EVA types, and the 5 - 34 PSU subset’s Log KEVA was affected in similar manner between EVA types. Increasing temperature was found to decrease munitions sorption over 5 - 25 ˚C, and it was found that EVA 80 was the most efficient sorption media out of the EVA subtypes. This is likely due to dipole interactions from the increase in the polar acetate group. An EVA polymer seeded with barium containing organic compounds was tested for efficacy in sulfate precipitation to the film for use in isotopic sulfur measurements. Out of the many barium containing organic compounds selected for testing, barium oxalate was chosen for its efficiency at precipitating and trapping sulfate from the marine environment, while being able to be easily purified by an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis procedure. It was also proven that the EVA sampler does not add an isotopic bias through fractionation during precipitation to the film from the environment. Overall, it was proven that the Ethylene Vinyl Acetate copolymer is an effective passive sorption media for marine systems, for both munitions compounds and inorganic sulfate...|$|E

40|$|The aims of {{this thesis}} were to {{identify}} good milking and watering routines for camels, and {{to better understand}} the physiological mechanisms that enable camels to produce milk during long periods of water deprivation. Milk production was increased by changing the number of milkings from one to four times per day in an on-farm study. Camels that calved in the long dry season had a higher lactation yield than those that calved in the wet season. Seven camels were subjected to four watering regimes, each 16 days long with 5 days of daily watering in between. The regimes were: water offered once every day (W 1); offered on days 4, 8, 12 and 16 (W 4); on days 8 and 16 (W 8) or on day 16 (W 16). Milk yield decreased after about 8 days of water deprivation, and changes in milk fat, lactose and protein concentrations remained small during W 16. Contrary to widespread belief, dehydrated camels did not dilute their milk, instead milk and blood plasma osmolality increased in parallel. Camels saved water by storing heat during daytime allowing body temperature to increase, and dissipating the heat during the cool night. Afternoon body temperature was around 39. 0 °C in all treatments but fell by 3 to 6 °C at night, with the lowest recorded values in severely hydrated camels. Despite low morning body temperatures, camels sought shade to avoid evaporative water loss but after drinking, they spent more time in the sun. Water deprived camels are known to compensate the number of kilograms of body weight lost by drinking equivalent number <b>of</b> <b>liters</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> and this has been assumed to indicate a full recovery. However, diminished food and salt intake, and sodium loss via urine and feces, are seldom considered. During dehydration, W 16 camels increased plasma vasopressin levels, which decreased upon drinking, but aldosterone concentration increased to retain sodium and camels took more than two weeks to recover. Camels maintained milk production during 8 days of water deprivation, to improve milk production, more frequent watering is recommended in the dry season...|$|E
