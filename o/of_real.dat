However, starting in 2013, construction of the station has caused the value <b>of</b> <b>real</b> estate {{in the area to}} start to rise. Although the surrounding area's real estate prices had been declining since the 1990s, there had been increases in the purchases and leases of residential units around the area, causing real estate prices to rise again. On the Upper East Side, prices <b>of</b> <b>real</b> estate west of Third Avenue had historically been higher than prices east of there, but due to the subway's construction, prices <b>of</b> <b>real</b> estate east of the avenue had risen dramatically since the station's construction started. With the opening of the new station, business owners hoped to see an increase in patronage.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Let S 1 (Γ,Γ) be the statement: For each {{sequence}} of point-cofinite open covers, one can pick one element from each cover and obtain a point-cofinite cover. b is the minimal cardinality {{of a set}} <b>of</b> <b>reals</b> not satisfying S 1 (Γ,Γ). We prove the following assertions: (1) If there is an unbounded tower, then there are sets <b>of</b> <b>reals</b> <b>of</b> cardinality b, satisfying S 1 (Γ,Γ). (2) It is consistent that all sets <b>of</b> <b>reals</b> satisfying S 1 (Γ,Γ) have cardinality smaller than b. These results can also be formulated as dealing with Arhangel’skĭı’s property α 2 for spaces of continuous real-valued functions. The main technical result is that in Laver’s model, each set <b>of</b> <b>reals</b> <b>of</b> cardinality b has an unbounded Borel image in the Baire space ωω. 1. Background Let P be a nontrivial property <b>of</b> sets <b>of</b> <b>reals.</b> The critical cardinality of P, denoted non(P), is the minimal cardinality of a set <b>of</b> <b>reals</b> not satisfying P. A natural question is {{whether there is a}} set <b>of</b> <b>reals</b> <b>of</b> cardinality at least non(P), which satisfies P, i. e., a nontrivial example. We consider the following property. Let X be a set <b>of</b> <b>reals.</b> U is a point-cofinite cover of X if U is infinite, and for each x ∈ X, {U ∈ U: x ∈ U} is a cofinite subset of U. 1 Having X fixed in the background, let Γ be the family of all point-cofinite open covers of X.
