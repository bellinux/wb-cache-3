With the combination of poor <b>overall</b> <b>results</b> and an ultra-slow-tempo style of play that fans found unappealing, attendance plummeted from the lofty marks achieved during the tenure of the popular Lemons to an average of barely more than 4,000 fans per game during Weltlich's final season (far below the turnout for Jody Conradt's Lady Longhorns teams at that time).|$|E

25|$|In an {{examination}} of all causes of stillbirth and infant mortality in Cumbria taken as a whole, between 1950 and 1993, 4,325 stillbirths, 3,430 neonatal death and 1,569 lethal congenital anomalies, occurred among 287,993 births. <b>Overall,</b> <b>results</b> did not infer {{an increased risk of}} still birth or neonatal death in Cumbria, the rate of these negative outcomes were largely in line with the British baseline rate. However, there was a cautioned connection between a small excess of increased risk of death from lethal congenital anomalies and proximity to municipal waste incinerators and chemical waste crematoriums being noted. With two examples of the latter crematoriums operating in both Barrow-in-Furness and further afield at Carlisle, crematoriums which may have emitted various chemical dioxins during their operation.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, a 2015 {{meta-analysis}} {{revealed that}} {{the positive effects of}} CBT on depression have been declining since 1977. The <b>overall</b> <b>results</b> showed two different declines in effect sizes: 1) an overall decline between 1977 and 2014, and 2) a steeper decline between 1995 and 2014. Additional sub-analysis revealed that CBT studies where therapists in the test group were instructed to adhere to the Beck CBT manual had a steeper decline in effect sizes since 1977 than studies where therapists in the test group were instructed to use CBT without a manual. The authors reported that they were unsure why the effects were declining but did list inadequate therapist training, failure to adhere to a manual, lack of therapist experience, and patients' hope and faith in its efficacy waning as potential reasons. The authors did mention that the current study was limited to depressive disorders only.|$|E
25|$|The International Skating Union (ISU) is the {{governing}} body for international competitions in figure skating, including the World Championships {{and the figure}} skating events at the Winter Olympic Games. Medals are awarded for <b>overall</b> <b>results.</b> The standard medal colors are gold for first place, silver for second, and bronze for third place. U.S. Figure Skating also awards pewter medals for fourth-place finishers in national events. At the World, European, Four Continents, and World Junior Championships, the ISU also awards small medals for segment results (short and free program). A medal is generally attributed to only one country, even if a partnership is composed of skaters of different nationalities. A notable exception are the 1910–1911 pair skating medals won by Ludowika Eilers / Walter Jakobsson; the medals are attributed to both Germany and Finland. Beyond the early 20th century, no skaters {{have been allowed to}} represent two countries in the same competition.|$|E

25|$|A {{study of}} {{elections}} {{has shown that}} the result of sports events can affect the <b>overall</b> <b>results.</b> A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences showed that when the home team wins the game before the election, the incumbent candidates can increase their share of the vote by 1.5 percent, while a loss had the opposite effect. The study looked at NCAA football games from 1946 to 2008. In addition, the study found that colleges with higher attendance rates had a larger effect on the results, up to 3%. The effects are increased even further if the game is an upset, that is, if the team expected to win does not. Other studies have confirmed these results for other sports, such as baseball and basketball. The study authors concluded that the win made voters feel better about society, boosting votes for the incumbent, while losses made voters feel worse, sending votes to the challenger. There was some speculation that the result of certain games could even decide the 2012 United States presidential election.|$|E
25|$|The idea of {{coalition}} government {{came when the}} PPP and the PML-N won the biggest seats in the 300-seat Parliament of Pakistan, the elections were set to be held on 8 January 2008 but were postponed until 18 February 2008 due to the assassination of former Pakistani PM Benazir Bhutto, after the elections were conducted in a peaceful manner, within the country of Pakistan, and the <b>overall</b> <b>results</b> showed that the PPP had won 93 seats with the PML-N winning 70 seats, and in total winning a number of 163 seats, and has {{the majority of the}} seats. After widespread speculation of the two parties forming a coalition government, it was finally announced on 30 February 2008, 18 days after the elections, that both parties were discussing a coalition government. Before the assassination of Ms Bhutto, she and Nawaz Sharif were discussing a coalition if they won the elections that were held supposed to be in on 8 January but no official agreement was reached. For the first time speaking after the accord was signed, Pervez Musharraf said that his government should keep personal vandettas aside, and keep politics aside, and had no problem working with a government that the people had elected.|$|E
25|$|A {{second step}} was the {{privatization}} of the Tbilisi Water Supply Company. In 2006, a credit of 25 million USD had {{been approved by the}} European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) to rehabilitate the water and sanitation infrastructure of Tbilisi. But the government refused the loan and instead opted for full privatization. In November 2007 it decided to sell the company to Multiplex Energy Limited, a newly created company whose ownership was not known to the public. The new company was obliged to keep tariffs unchanged {{for the next five years}} and to make substantial improvements, including the rehabilitation of the sewer infrastructure by 2012, 24-hour water supply within the entire service area by 2015 and the construction of a new wastewater treatment plant at Gardabani to replace the dilapidated existing plant by 2018. The private company took over its responsibilities in May 2008. A performance incentive system for employees and a new billing system were introduced, and connections were gradually retrofitted with meters reaching 23% of customers in 2013. According to an independent study, the <b>overall</b> <b>results</b> of water privatization in Tbilisi were positive. While staffing levels did gradually decrease from 1,962 full-time equivalents in 2006 to 1,606 in 2012, training and overall job satisfaction all increased. The average income of employees doubled between 2006 and 2013. This was more than the inflation rate during the same period, but increases were not as high as the average for water and power companies in Georgia. Furthermore, physical water losses and water theft (non-revenue water) decreased slightly (from 42% in 2006 to 38% in 2013) and water supply became continuous within the old administrative borders of Tbilisi in 2013.|$|E
