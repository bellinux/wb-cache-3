5|$|Hand's {{three years}} at Harvard Law School were intellectually and {{socially}} stimulating. In his second year, he moved into a boarding house {{with a group of}} fellow law students who were to become close friends. They studied hard and enjoyed discussing philosophy and literature and telling bawdy tales. Hand's intellectual reputation proved less of a hindrance at law school than it had as an undergraduate. He was elected to the Pow-Wow Club, in which law students practiced their skills in moot courts. He was also chosen as an editor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Harvard</b> Law Review, although he resigned in 1894 because it took too much time from his studies.|$|E

Her removal was automatically triggered after she missed three consecutive board meetings between 1986 and 1989. In 1990, Collins accepted the presidency of Saint Catharine College in Springfield, Kentucky, becoming the first president of the small, Catholic college who was not a Dominican nun. College officials stated that Collins was recruited for the presidency to raise the college's profile.|$|E
5|$|Oscar Finley and Wally Figg are the bickering {{partners}} {{of a small}} law firm in the South Side of Chicago; in fact, {{for much of the}} time they are just a pair of ambulance chasers. Oscar's character holds the firm together despite the childish and unethical behavior of Wally, his junior partner. Their bickering is often mediated by Rochelle, the highly competent African American secretary, who had learned a lot of law in her eight years in the office. Meanwhile, David Zinc, a graduate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Harvard</b> Law School, is completely fed up with the grinding and dehumanizing – though well-paid – life of an associate in the law firm of Rogan Rothberg, where in five years of work he had never seen the inside of a courtroom, in fact, David's expertise was in long-term bonds a job he hated. David suddenly breaks away, goes on a drinking binge and by chance finds himself at the Finley & Figg office. Feeling an elevating sense of freedom and vowing never to go back, Zinc willingly relegates himself to working for the two disreputable street lawyers and ambulance chasers.|$|E

His mother is the {{director}} of the Himmelfarb Mobile University which provides education for the elderly, while his father is a lawyer for Covington & Burling. He has a brother, Jacob, and a sister, Teme. Weinstein attended St. Albans High School in Washington, D.C., where he met and became best friends with Bill Oakley in the eighth grade.

5|$|William Lloyd Oakley {{was born}} on February 27, 1966 in Westminster, Maryland and raised {{on a farm in}} Union Bridge, Maryland.

He attended St. Albans High School in Washington D.C., where he met and became best friends with Josh Weinstein in the eighth grade. The two created the school humor magazine The Alban Antic in 1983. Such would be the length of their partnership; the two often finish each other's sentences.

5|$|Gray became {{engaged to}} Jane Lathrop Loring of Boston in May 1847. Two of Gray's younger brothers, George and Joseph, were {{students}} at Harvard {{in the late}} 1840s and lived with Gray. During his junior year, George caught typhoid fever in late 1847 and died on January9, 1848, in the Loring house in Boston. This {{is part of the}} reason Gray's marriage was delayed from fall 1847 to spring 1848. Gray and Jane Loring married on May4, 1848. Her parents were Charles Greely Loring, a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Harvard</b> Corporation and a lawyer, and Anna Pierce (Brace) Loring. Her family was Unitarian, like most faculty and staff of Harvard at the time. Both of them kept to their separate religious denominations yet seem to have had no difficulties over it. They had no children. Jane Gray accompanied her husband on most of his expeditions. Gray was a devout Presbyterian and was a member of First Church in Cambridge, a Congregational church, where he served as a deacon. He was also an ardent empiricist in the tradition of John Locke and John Stuart Mill. When the congregation moved into its present building in 1872, at 11Garden Street, Gray planted two Kentucky yellowwood trees, Cladrastis kentukea, in front of the church. They stood until October 2014.|$|E

Obama represented the 13th District for three terms in the Illinois Senate from 1997 to 2004, when he ran for the U.S. Senate. Obama received national attention in 2004, with his unexpected March primary win, his well-received July Democratic National Convention keynote address, and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, Obama was nominated for president, a year after his campaign began, and after a close primary campaign against Hillary Clinton. He was elected over Republican John McCain, and was inaugurated on January 20, 2009. Nine months later, Obama was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.|$|E
