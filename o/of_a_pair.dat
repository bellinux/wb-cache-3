5|$|Chelicerate nervous {{systems are}} based on the {{standard}} arthropod model <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of nerve cords, each with a ganglion per segment, and a brain formed by fusion of the ganglia just behind the mouth with those ahead of it. If one assume that chelicerates lose the first segment, which bears antennae in other arthropods, chelicerate brains include only one pair of pre-oral ganglia instead of two. However, there is evidence that the first segment is indeed available and bears the cheliceres.|$|E
5|$|Diamond's thermal {{conductivity}} is {{made use of}} by jewelers and gemologists who may employ an electronic thermal probe to separate diamonds from their imitations. These probes consist <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of battery-powered thermistors mounted in a fine copper tip. One thermistor functions as a heating device while the other measures {{the temperature of the}} copper tip: if the stone being tested is a diamond, it will conduct the tip's thermal energy rapidly enough to produce a measurable temperature drop. This test takes about 2–3 seconds.|$|E

5|$|Like other corvids, ravens can mimic {{sounds from}} their environment, {{including}} human speech. Non-vocal sounds {{produced by the}} common raven include wing whistles and bill snapping.

5|$|Like other nuthatches, {{this is a}} noisy {{species with}} a range of vocalizations. The male's mating song is a rapid nasal qui-qui-qui-qui-qui-qui-qui. The contact call between members <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair,</b> given most {{frequently}} in the fall and winter is a thin squeaky nit, uttered up to 30 times a minute. A more distinctive sound is a shrill kri repeated rapidly with mounting anxiety or excitement kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri; the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin subspecies have a higher, faster yididitititit call, and Pacific birds a more nasal beeerf.|$|E
5|$|Make Way for Ducklings is a children's {{picture book}} written and {{illustrated}} by Robert McCloskey.

5|$|The Conservators {{applied for}} a second act of {{parliament}} in 1707, as they needed a further £3,800 to finance projects including {{the building of a}} half-lock and the removal of a shoal just below Knapp Bridge. Boats carrying 15tons of cargo could reach Taunton by 1717. The navigation included a lock and two or more half-locks, consisting <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of gates to hold back the water, and an agreement to build a towpath between Ham Mills and Taunton was reached in 1724.|$|E

5|$|The first, indirect, {{detection}} of gravitational waves {{came in the}} 1970s through observation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of closely orbiting neutron stars, PSR B1913+16.

5|$|The {{game would}} be the first of the 1985–86 season for both teams. Since the return fixture at Hampden Park on 27 March, both teams had played twice, with each playing one of the other teams in the {{qualifying}} group and a friendly. Wales had secured a comfortable home win against Spain in the World Cup qualifying tournament, but had gone down to defeat in Norway. Scotland meanwhile went into the match on the back <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of wins against England and Iceland.|$|E

5|$|The {{ignition}} system {{consisted of two}} rear-mounted, crankshaft-driven magnetos, each supplying one <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of spark plugs fitted to each cylinder.

5|$|The {{method of}} Mokhtarian and Mackworth {{involves}} computing the curve-shortening flow, tracking the inflection {{points of the}} curve as they progress through the flow, and drawing a graph that plots {{the positions of the}} inflection points around the curve against the time parameter. The inflection points will typically be removed from the curve in pairs as the curve becomes convex (according to the Gage–Hamilton–Grayson theorem) and the lifetime <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of points corresponds to the salience of a feature of the shape.|$|E
5|$|This {{can be used}} {{to derive}} the {{correlation}} of the quantum polarisations of the two photons. Their prediction was confirmed experimentally by Chien-Shiung Wu and I. Shaknov in 1950. This was the first experimental confirmation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of entangled photons as applicable to the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox. The result was subsequently explained by Richard Dalitz and Frank Duarte. Apparently following Dirac's doctrine, Ward was never bothered by issues of interpretation in quantum mechanics.|$|E
5|$|A road {{bearing the}} M-81 {{designation}} has existed {{since at least}} July 1, 1919, when the state initially numbered its trunkline highways. Since that time, it has been extended, rerouted or shortened several times. These changes resulted in essentially the modern highway routing by 1926; the highway was fully paved in the 1940s. A change made in 1929 was reversed in 1933, and an extension through downtown Saginaw in the 1960s was overturned in the 1970s.
