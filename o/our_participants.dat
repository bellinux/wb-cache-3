We use data from several large impact studies, including a total of 55,000 deliveries to demonstrate an improvement in maternal and fetal outcomes, including {{a reduction in the}} cesarean delivery rate. With the implementation of our ideas and practices,r roughly 15,000 unnecessary caesarean deliveries can be prevented and episiotomies. We are also making some progress in reducing the number of unnecessary episiotomies. Anecdotal reports suggest that we have even saved the lives of at least ten women and their babies through the dissemination of our crash cesarean delivery protocol. We are bringing a positive change to Chinese culture where laboring mothers can fully appreciate the miracle of childbirth without experiencing the unnecessary pain that comes with it.|$|E

The purpose of LEAP is to inspire, empower and equip business owners, youth, teachers and social entrepreneurs with the skills and tools for personal and organizational transformation. LEAP provides training on leadership, ethics and civics.

30|$|C was not altered {{during the}} {{marathon}} in <b>our</b> <b>participant.</b> This finding was unexpected because the participant suffered from coordination problems {{during the second}} treadmill test, which in turn should increase C. In fact, it was shown that in younger recreationally active runners C was increased after exhausting exercise (Lazzer et al. 2014). The unique running pattern of <b>our</b> <b>participant,</b> which is certainly different than the normal or conventional running technique, might represent a very efficient running pattern that is not influenced by fatigue. Despite the participant’s unusual running technique, C was not different {{when compared to the}} respective value found in recreationally active runners aged 17 – 54 years (Di Prampero et al. 1986, Lazzer et al. 2014). Accordingly, it was proposed that C does not depend on running experience and training in younger people (Slawinski and Billat 2004).|$|R

40|$|The {{security}} of many computer systems {{hinges on the}} secrecy of a single word – if an adversary obtains knowledge of a password, they will {{gain access to the}} resources controlled by this password. Human users are the ‘weakest link ’ in password control, due to our propensity to reuse passwords and to create weak ones. Policies which forbid such unsafe password practices are often violated, even if these policies are well-advertised. We have studied how users perceive their accounts and their passwords. <b>Our</b> <b>participants</b> mentally classified their accounts and passwords into a few groups, based on a small number of perceived similarities. <b>Our</b> <b>participants</b> used stronger passwords, and reused passwords less, in account groups which they considered more important. <b>Our</b> <b>participants</b> thus demonstrated awareness of the basic tenets of password safety, but they did not behave safely in all respects. Almost half of <b>our</b> <b>participants</b> reused {{at least one of the}} passwords in their high-importance accounts. Our findings add to the body of evidence that a typical computer user suffers from ‘password overload’. Our concepts of password and account grouping point the way toward more intuitive user interfaces for passwordand account-management systems. ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Hyperacusis is the {{difference}} in dB between a normal threshold of audibility for a stimulus and the dB level at which that stimulus becomes intolerably loud. Some persons with autism exhibit symptoms of hyperacusis possibly attributable to phobias to auditory stimuli. Desensitization procedures {{have been used as}} a treatment for phobias and appear a promising treatment for patients with autism and hyperacusis. Methods: <b>Our</b> <b>participant</b> was a 26 year old male previously diagnosed Asperger 2 ̆ 7 s syndrome who presented with hyperacusis to low-pitched voices and a concomitant vocal disorder manifesting mainly as high vocal pitch. Despite not fully accepting treatment goals he agreed to treatment in our clinic. A systematic auditory desensitization program was employed to treat hyperacusis, including use of recorded male voices, musical instruments, and environmental sounds. In addition, a modified vocal re-education therapy program was also employed which included instruction on easy onset of phonation, biofeedback, ergonomic progressive imagery relaxation techniques and home exercises to reduce vocal hyperfunction and promote phonatorily efficient breath-stream management. Results: Initial, 7 month, and 13 month hyperacusis measures and voice evaluations were conducted. Hyperacusis evaluations showed <b>our</b> <b>participant</b> 2 ̆ 7 s hyperacusis for lower-frequency tones improved by up to 30 dB bilaterally and his hyperacusis for running speech improved 40 dB improved in the right ear and 35 dB in the left ear. His vocal pitch, measured as fundamental vocal frequency, improved from 404. 471 Hz to 280. 78 Hz. Conclusions: Our systematic auditory desensitization program decreased <b>our</b> <b>participant</b> 2 ̆ 7 s hyperacusis and our modified vocal re-education therapy (VRT) program lowered his vocal pitch. However, the results did not generalize beyond the clinic. The latter may be attributable to <b>our</b> <b>participant</b> 2 ̆ 7 s unwillingness to fully accept treatment goals, which may serve as a caveat to future clinicians to consider prognosis prior to making treatment decisions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of a {{small-scale}} narrative study {{of men and women who}} grew up in mid-twentieth-century rural Wales, and their reminiscences regarding women and education.

We use Bourdieusian notions of types of cultural capital and the role of women in transmitting this to illuminate <b>our</b> <b>participants</b> ’ narratives. Accounts of family life disclosed themes of sacrifice concerning education, poverty during childhood and the role of school teaching as a career for women. Yet at the same time, there were forms of exclusion in operation.

40|$|Working memory (WM) {{is defined}} as a storage system limited in its {{capacity}} and involved in maintaining and manipulating information over short periods of time (Baddeley, 2003). In WM tasks, individuals are required to simultaneously store certain items in memory while updating the contents of their WM. It has been proposed that WM interacts with language abilities and deficits in WM influence language performance (Baddeley, 2003; Carpenter, & Just, 1989; Murray, 2012). Importantly, individuals with aphasia often show WM and short-term memory (STM) deficits, which may negatively affect language symptoms and recovery, and accordingly WM treatment may represent an efficient approach to addressing these individuals’ cognitive and linguistic impairments (Kalinyak-Fliszar, Kohen, & Martin, 2011; Murray, 2012; Martin et al., 2012). WM treatment for individuals with aphasia, however, has not yet been intensively studied (Murray, 2012). Previous results indicate that WM in individuals with aphasia can be improved with training (e. g., Kalinyak-Fliszar et al., 2011; Mayer & Murray, 2002; Vallat et al., 2005). Nonetheless, variable amounts of generalization to language abilities and types of untrained cognitive and linguistic functions responding to the WM treatment have been reported. Accordingly, to examine further the potential of WM training to remediate the cognitive-linguistic symptoms of individuals with aphasia, we administered a treatment with tasks designed not only to target WM skills but also semantic processing, the linguistic ability most compromised in <b>our</b> aphasic <b>participant.</b> The research questions were: a) Would <b>our</b> <b>participant</b> with chronic aphasia demonstrate improved WM through treatment? b) Would <b>our</b> <b>participant</b> demonstrate improved language performance given WM tasks that involved verbal stimuli...|$|R
