According to this approach, {{it is necessary to}} break the symmetry {{at the base of the}} crude causal theory. Fodor must find some criterion for distinguishing the occurrences of A caused by As (true) from those caused by Bs (false). The point of departure, according to Fodor, is that while the false cases are ontologically dependent on the true cases, the reverse is not true. There is an asymmetry of dependence, in other words, between the true contents (A= A) and the false ones (A = A or B). The first can subsist independently of the second, but the second can occur only because of the existence of the first:From the point of view of semantics, errors must be accidents: if in the extension of [...] "horse" [...] there are no cows, then it cannot be required for the meaning of [...] "horse" [...] that cows be called horses. On the other hand, if [...] "horse" [...] did not mean that which it means, and if it were an error for horses, it would never be possible for a cow to be called [...] "horse". Putting the two things together, it can be seen that the possibility of falsely saying [...] "this is a horse" [...] presupposes the existence of a semantic basis for saying it truly, but not vice versa. If we put this in terms of the crude causal theory, the fact that cows cause <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> [...] "horse" [...] depends on the fact that horses cause <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> [...] "horse"; but the fact that horses cause <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> [...] "horse" [...] does not depend on the fact that cows cause <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> [...] "horse"...|$|E

500|$|Frusciante's {{new musical}} {{approach}} met a mixed response from fans and critics. AllMusic's Fred Thomas {{in his review}} of PBX Funicular Intaglio Zone stated: [...] "The ever-winding path of John Frusciante's solo career is a confusing <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> the least. [...] The thing is, there's no doubt that Frusciante is sincere in his expression with this incredibly warped music. There's no easy explanation for these sounds, no context {{for a lot of}} the choices he makes with the rapid-fire style changes and jarring production choices that come one after another after another on almost every song here." ...|$|E

500|$|Lytle later noted, [...] "It was {{actually}} Jim 's fault. He {{suggested that we}} consider playing some shows, and I went, 'No', [...] he convinced me {{it might be a}} good idea. We talked about it for a little while. I didn't think anyone else in the band would be into it, [...] he checked around and it turns out they were all enthusiastic. I think I was the last <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> yes.... I {{was actually}} blown away that they even wanted to. Once I found that out, I said 'OK, let's start doing the work, figure out how to play the songs.' The weird moment was when he had the first rehearsal; I had no idea how it was going to turn out. After five days of playing together it actually sounded really good. It was too easy, and we were actually really having a good time together." ...|$|E
500|$|Command in the Southwest Pacific Area was complicated. Instead of {{operations}} {{being conducted by}} the Sixth Army, its headquarters was used for what became Alamo Force. As a task force, Alamo Force came directly under MacArthur, rather than under the Allied Land Forces. Krueger noted that [...] "the inherent difficulties faced by my dual headquarters in planning and administration were aggravated by the command setup, which was a novel <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> the least." [...] Because Alamo Force was a purely operational entity, administration was handled by the United States Army Forces in the Far East. Although {{there was only one}} army staff, Alamo Force was in New Guinea while the main body of Sixth Army headquarters was in Brisbane until February 1944, when the two were finally brought together. They still had a dual role as Alamo Force and Sixth Army until September, when Alamo Force was discontinued and the Sixth Army became directly responsible for operations.|$|E
500|$|Producer Kevin Shirley {{was brought}} in {{on the advice of}} Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry. [...] As Rich explained, [...] "We really wanted to work with someone who can come in and say, 'That's not good.'... If Kevin says {{something}} I disagree with, he'll be the first <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> 'Hey, it's your song,' but it's healthy for me and Chris to have him come in and be as excited about our songs as we are and say, 'Okay, that's cool, but what if we tried this?'" [...] At his first meeting with the band, Shirley described the songs played for him as having [...] "the same old jammy, shuffle feel of the last two records. [...] I stopped them then and I said to them... 'You've got to feel like you're teenagers again. You need a song like that.'" [...] Shirley's prompting led the band to write [...] "Kickin' My Heart Around" [...] on the spot, before he had signed on to produce. [...] Rich agreed that Shirley shifted the focus to making [...] "a rock record" [...] that was [...] "focused and concise".|$|E

500|$|For {{most of the}} film, Berry's character, Turner, the 9-1-1 operator, does {{stay inside}} [...] "the hive" [...] before {{becoming}} {{actively involved in the}} search for Breslin's character, Welson, the kidnapped caller. D'Ovidio chose two female leads, explaining, [...] "I wanted strong women... I think it was appropriate here, since most 911 call operators are women." [...] Berry remarked, [...] "I love the idea of being a part of a movie that was so empowering for women. We don't often get to play roles like this, where ordinary people become heroic and do something extraordinary." [...] D'Ovidio chose to tell the story from the perspective of two characters—the operator and the caller—believing that it would become repetitive if it focused on only one. As a result, he switched perspectives every ten pages when writing the screenplay. As well as collaborating on the story with his wife, Nicole and Jon Bokenkamp, he accepted suggestions from Berry, Breslin and Eklund: [...] "Halle came in with some great notes and Abigail and Michael and it started to flesh things out. I'm not <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> 'no' to a great suggested line of dialogue. It just makes me look better as a writer! I feel it's a very collaborative process, and some of the happiest accidents happen when you just listen to people. When someone comes up to you and says, 'Why don't we do it this way?' I think that it's important to listen." ...|$|E

He called for ousting the regime, as in Tunisia. Subsequently, [...] "when he joined protesters Friday after noon prayers, police fired water cannons at him and his supporters.

[...] ElBaradei said he was [...] "proud of the protesters" [...] and proud of the military, who by 29 January were the only state force on the streets of Cairo, with police nowhere to be seen. There were numerous individual public displays of affection and respect for soldiers manning positions on the streets.

2500|$|Red Sox {{pitching}} coach John Farrell stated that Buchholz {{would most likely}} be in line for 180–190 innings in the 2008 season. On May 15, Buchholz {{was placed on the}} 15-day disabled list {{as the result of a}} torn fingernail. He was optioned to Triple-A Pawtucket following the injury, and remained there for several weeks to work on his fastball. On July 11, he was recalled to Boston and was part of their regular pitching rotation, though he did not record a single win after his return. On August 20, as the Red Sox were trying to sweep the Orioles, the team that Buchholz had no-hit the preceding year, he gave up a 4–0 lead by allowing three runs in the second inning and two more in the third. He was removed after only pitching [...] innings. In his previous start, he had only lasted three innings. In 2008, the Red Sox were 3–12 in Buchholz' fifteen starts. After the game, Buchholz was demoted to Double-A Portland. Buchholz stated [...] "I've never had a streak like this", and [...] "I've never been <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> the pressure was too much for me, but I've felt like I've had a lot of weight on my shoulders just trying to be perfect and trying to do everything as well as I could to help this team win". Following the 2008 season, Buchholz pitched in the Arizona Fall League.|$|E

[...] "He spit out his coffee and tuna sandwich and couldn't stop laughing," [...] recalled Brooks. [...] "He said [...] "I vow to get this movie made. The world must see this picture."" [...] Glazier struggled at first to interest movie studios in the show business satire, but with perseverance Joseph E.
