50|$|During the 2016 United States presidential election, the {{fabrication}} and coverage <b>of</b> fake <b>news</b> increased substantially.

In {{an effort to reduce}} the effects <b>of</b> fake <b>news,</b> fact-checking websites, including Snopes.com and FactCheck.org, have posted guides to spotting and avoiding fake news websites. New critical readings of media events and news with an emphasis on literalism and logic have also emerged. Social media sites and search engines, such as Facebook and Google, received criticism for facilitating the spread <b>of</b> fake <b>news.</b> Both <b>of</b> these corporations have taken measures to explicitly prevent the spread of fake news; critics, however, believe more action is needed.|$|R

Reports {{that are difficult to}} interpret also delay the volatility increase. This delay is incremental to that caused by reporting bad news, although the effect <b>of</b> bad <b>news</b> on slowing down the reaction time is dominant. It is argued that the delays reflect market uncertainty about the implications <b>of</b> the <b>news.</b> Copyright Blackwell Publishers Ltd 2002. ...|$|R

This three-phase model is the guiding framework for the literature review. The article identifies the strategic functions served by different bad news management activities and highlights many dilemmas facing managers in the delivery <b>of</b> bad <b>news.</b> The article concludes with identifying new directions for research on the delivery <b>of</b> bad <b>news</b> in organizations...|$|R

5|$|Legislation {{requires}} that all presidential and parliamentary election candidates (or slates) are guaranteed equal opportunity to present and discuss their platforms {{in the media}} (in addition to paid advertising). In 2007 the parliamentary election campaign was covered by all media, including nationwide television broadcasters. During this period the broadcasters, which included Croatian Radiotelevision (HTV), RTL Televizija (RTL) and Nova TV, aired 27.8hours <b>of</b> <b>news</b> on 22 different programs with 1,196 news reports. This total included 171 reports dealing directly with the elections. Analysis <b>of</b> <b>news</b> coverage indicated evenly-matched coverage of the combined ruling party (HDZ) and official government statements on one side, and the main opposition party (SDP) on the other; each received an average of a 37.5-percent share of coverage and a 33-percent share of interviews aired. HTV and Nova TV gave a slight advantage to the HDZ and the government, while RTL gave more coverage to the SDP. However, the differences were small and resulted in matching ratios. Other political parties received considerably less coverage. HNS received an average of approximately 11 percent of the coverage, HSS received six percent and all other parties received less than five-percent coverage. The national television broadcasters air programs where all slates and candidates may talk about their platforms and organise debates.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of an {{investigation}} into the neutrality of the narrative discussion of financial performance and position, as evidenced in 179 annual reports of UK listed companies. Neutrality of narrative discussion was determined by comparing the average proportions of good and bad news contained in the narrative and statutory accounts sections of the annual reports. The results of a comparison of the proportion <b>of</b> good <b>news</b> in the two sections of the annual reports suggest that the narrative sections contained a significantly higher proportion <b>of</b> good <b>news</b> than the statutory accounts sections. Comparison of proportions <b>of</b> bad <b>news,</b> however, indicates that the narrative sections contained a significantly lower proportion <b>of</b> bad <b>news</b> compared to the statutory accounts sections. Finally, the results also suggest that the proportion <b>of</b> good <b>news</b> as compared to bad news in the narrative sections is significantly higher than the proportion <b>of</b> good <b>news</b> compared to bad news in the statutory accounts section. The results are consistent with the suggestion that company management highlights good news in narrative discussions. Th...|$|R
