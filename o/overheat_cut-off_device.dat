40|$|Abstract The {{innovative}} {{process of}} curved profile extrusion facilitates the cost-effective production of lightweight structures with spatially curved profiles even for small series. Due to the extrusion process a continuous {{flow of material}} is unavoidable. The profiles have to be separated reactionlessly during the extrusion following the complex trajectory of the cut-off point in space. This paper discusses the challenges for a flying <b>cut-off</b> <b>device.</b> In addition to a concept to generate the trajectories and control the movements, the main parameters for dimensioning a <b>cut-off</b> <b>device</b> are presented. A specially designed clamping device permits to generate high accelerations.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Transcutaneous {{bilirubin}} (TcB) has {{the potential}} to reduce serum bilirubin sampling. During a recent survey on the use of TcB in postnatal units in the Republic of Ireland, we identified that only 58 % of the 19 units were using TcB and that only two devices were in use, the BiliChek(R) and JM 103 (R). We aimed to evaluate and compare these two devices in a regional postnatal unit. METHODS: To evaluate and compare the accuracy of the BiliChek(R) and JM 103 (R), we studied simultaneous TcB and total serum bilirubin (TSB) measurements from a population of jaundiced term and near term infants. We evaluated each device with regard to correlation with TSB and potential to safely reduce serum bilirubin testing. RESULTS: Both TcB devices strongly correlated with TSB (r = 0. 88 for BiliChek(R) and r = 0. 70 for JM 103 (R). The BiliChek(R) and JM 103 (R) were accurate up to cut-off values of 200 mumol/L and 180 mumol/L, respectively. Using Bhutani's nomogram, 100 % sensitivity was achieved using the 75 th percentile for BiliChek(R) and the 40 th percentile for JM 103 (R). CONCLUSION: Both TcB devices correlated closely with moderately increased TSB levels and are suitable screening tools to identify jaundiced infants that require a serum bilirubin, with upper limit <b>cut-off</b> values. Both <b>devices</b> reduced the need for TSB levels. We found the BiliChek(R) slightly more accurate than the JM 103 (R) for our study population. TcB however, is not in widespread use...|$|R

So far, several configurations have been proposed, mostly based on integrated Mach-Zehnder interferometers [1] or polarization/phase rotation in piezo-electric crystal [2]. While the first scheme requires initial electrical bias {{to compensate for the}} phase mismatch between the two arms, the second one requires interrogation or phase noise reduction systems that are expensive to implement. Near <b>cut-off</b> optical waveguide <b>devices</b> have been already reported in LiNbO 3. In particular, the use of waveguides at cut-off was proposed for modulation in the field of optical communications [3, 4] and sensing [5]. We present a novel integrated optical high voltage sensor based on a Z-cut LiNbO 3 which operates without any metallic parts. The proposed device is sketched in Fig. 1 (left). An annealed proton exchange (APE) waveguide near cut-off is fabricated in Z-cut LiNbO 3 and centered in a domain inverted region. The application of an external electric field parallel to the z axis of the device produces a refractive index change n between positive and negative domains given by ne 3 r 33 E, where E is the intensity of the external electric field along the z-axis, ne= 2. 14 and r 33 = 30. 8 pm/V are the refractive index and the electro-optic coefficient along the z-axis, respectively.

Conventional detection techniques and multiplex PCR for 14 typical bacterial pneumonia-associated pathogens were performed on respiratory samples collected from adult hospitalized patients enrolled in a prospective multi-center study. Patients were enrolled from March until September 2012. A total of 739 fresh, native samples were eligible for analysis, of which 75 were sputa, 421 aspirates, and 234 bronchial lavages. 276 pathogens were detected by microbiology for which a valid PCR result was generated (positive or negative detection result by Curetis prototype system). Among these, 120 were identified by the prototype assay, 50 pathogens were not detected. Overall performance of the prototype for pathogen identification was 70. 6 % sensitivity (95 % confidence interval (CI) lower bound: 63. 3 %, upper bound: 76. 9 %) and 95. 2 % specificity (95 % CI lower bound: 94. 6 %, upper bound: 95. 7 %).

40|$|In this work, phase-based {{methods for}} {{emerging}} applications implemented with advanced CMOS technology are proposed. We use phase-based methods {{to solve problems}} in high- speed chip-chip/chip-memory data link interconnect, and in terahertz system. With increasing demand for bandwidth between chip-chip and chip-memory communication, high-speed data link interconnect becomes a key block in modern computer systems. In or- der to serve portable devices, energy efficiency is a critical metric for data link interconnect. Multiband RF Interconnect, which transmits data by upconverts data streams into multiple frequency bands, can fully exploit the bandwidth of interconnect wire with excellent energy efficiency. In order to demodulate data stream, a correct carrier phase in receiver end is necessary. The conventional way for carrier phase synchronization requires high-speed, high- resolution analog-to-digital converter, which consumes large amount of power and silicon area. In the proposed phase-based method, a pilot signal is sent by transmit side, and in receiver end a simple comparator is sufficient to identify correct phase. This greatly enhances energy efficiency of data link and reduces cost. In addition, optimal demodulation phase for dispersive channel is derived. The other proposed application for phase-based method is terahertz systems. CMOS tera- hertz source suffer from low <b>device</b> <b>cut-off</b> frequency, and fundamental frequency is limited. Conventional time-domain harmonic extraction can selectively enhance certain harmonic of fundamental tone at output radiation and suppress other harmonics, and therefore increase effective radiation frequency. In terahertz band, time-domain harmonic extraction cannot achieve sufficient low-order harmonic suppression. A spatial-domain harmonic extraction method is proposed, which samples signal in specific spatial positions and combines sampled signals together to selectively enhance and eliminate tones. With proposed method, 1. 4 -THz CMOS imaging is achieved. In addition, a fast characterization method for terahertz source is proposed. This method uses random sampling (compressive sensing), and reconstruct sparse spectral profile by two-step zoom-in algorithm. With proposed method, a 8 X time re- duction can be achieved for terahertz source characterization, which enables regular self-test of terahertz systems...|$|R

Based on the studies, the most common complaint reported is of the VDT users. Methods: This study attempts to design a proper tool to assess the visual fatigue of the VDT users. First draft of the questionnaire was prepared after a thorough study on the books, papers and similar questionnaires. The validity and reliability of the questionnaire was confirmed using the content validity index (CVI) beside that of the Cronbach′s Coefficient Alpha. Then, a cross-sectional study was carried out on 248 of the VDT users in different professions. A theoretical model with four categories of symptoms of visual fatigue was derived from the previous studies and questionnaires. Having used the AMOS 16 software, the construct validity of the questionnaire was evaluated using the confirmatory factor analysis. The correlation co-efficiency of the internal domains was calculated using the SPSS 11. 5 software. To assess the quality check index and determining the visual fatigue levels, visual fatigue of the VDT users was measured by the questionnaire and visual fatigue meter (VFM) <b>device.</b> <b>Cut-off</b> points were identified by receiver operating characteristic curves. Results: CVI and reliability co-efficiency were both equal to 0. 75.

40|$|The {{electronics}} {{industry has}} a large silicon infrastructure for the manufacture of complementary-metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) based electronics. The increasing density of Si based circuits has set a pace that is now pushing the physical limits of connectivity between devices over conventional wire based links. This has driven the increasing interest in Si based optoelectronics {{and to use the}} groundwork already established by the electronics industry for lower cost optical communications. The greatest limitation to this effort has been the incorporation of a Si based laser, which requires integration of a direct bandgap material within this CMOS process. The Ge 1 -xSnx alloy is one material of interest for this field of Si photonics due to its compatibility on Si CMOS circuits and its direct bandgap for increasing Sn content. The past decade of material development in this field has led to Ge 1 -xSnx films grown on Si with direct bandgaps. The work in this dissertation set out to develop Ge 1 -xSnx based optoelectronics operating in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) region. The fabrication methodology of Ge 1 -xSnx active photonic components such as microdisk resonators, photoconductors, and avalanche photodiodes were developed. A simple, one-mask fabrication method was developed to create Ge 1 -xSnx microdisk resonators on Si, which could serve as a platform for the first on-Si CMOS laser. A study of the noise levels, effective carrier lifetime, and specific detectivity was conducted {{for the first time on}} any Ge 1 -xSnx detector. A systematic study of detectors with Sn content ranging from 0. 9 to 10. 0 % were fabricated and measured for their responsivity and spectral response in the SWIR.

40|$|Authors: Palanimurugan R & R Jürgen Dohmen ### Abstract We have {{established}} an ultrafiltration-based *in vitro* assay for determining polyamine binding to proteins. In the protocol described {{here we have}} used *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* ODC antizyme protein produced in *E. coli* and radioactive polyamines to measure the direct binding of polyamines to ODC antizyme protein. ### Introduction Polyamines are small aliphatic polycations present in all cells. Polyamines {{are known to have}} several important functions, which are essential for life (Ref. 1). The cellular polyamine pool contains several modified forms of polyamines, however putrescine, spemidine and spermine are the most abundant among others. Normally polyamines exert their molecular functions by direct binding to cellular macromolecules such as DNA, RNA and proteins (Refs. 1 and 2). We {{have established}} an in vitro polyamine binding assay that enables identification and characterization of novel polyamine targets. Using this ultrafiltration-based protocol, we have assayed polyamine (spermidine or spermine) binding to yeast or human ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) antizyme (AZ) (Refs. 3 and 4) protein produced in *Escherichia coli*. Apart from being easy and fast, this protocol requires only small quantities of purified proteins for determination of polyamine binding. Combined with protein fractionation methods, this protocol can be applied for the identification of novel intra or extra cellular polyamine binding proteins. The protocol given below describes determination of polyamine binding for 6 His-tagged *S. cerevisiae* ODC antizyme (OAZ 1). An adopted version of this protocol was used to determine polyamine binding to human antizyme fused to maltose binding protein (Ref. 4). ### Reagents 1. Buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7. 8 at 4 °C) - [3 H]-spemidine (PerkinElmer, cat No: NET 522001 MC) - [14 C]-spermine (GE Healthcare, cat No: CFA 511) - 6 His-OAZ 1 (*S. cerevisiae*) in IMAC elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7. 8 containing 250 mM imidazole) after expression in E. coli and purification by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). - Mock preparation from *E. coli* cells transformed with an empty vector not expressing 6 His-OAZ 1. - Scintillation liquid (picard) - Microcentrifuge tubes (Eppendorf) ### Equipment 1. Refrigerated Microcentrifuge - Centrifugal filter, Modified polyethersulfone (PES) 10 K (VWR, Cat No: 82031 - 350) - Scintillation counter ### Procedure 1. Keep all reagents on ice. Pre-cool the centrifuge to 4 °C. - Label the microcentrifuge tubes and keep them on ice. - Prepare the polyamine binding mix in the pre-cooled microcentrifuge tubes as shown Table A & B shown in figures section. - Mix the polyamine binding mix gently and incubate on ice for 60 min. - Place the filtration device in a 1. 5 ml collection tube and pre-cool on ice. - After the 60 min incubation time, transfer 100 μL of the polyamine binding mix to the appropriately labelled filtration devices. - Filter the free polyamines by spinning at 2500 xg for 5 min at 4 °C - Prepare microcentrifugefuge tubes with 1 mL scintillation liquid (two tubes with scintillation liquid for every filter device used) and keep them at room temperature. - Remove 10 μL of the retentate from inside the <b>cut-off</b> filter <b>device</b> and add it to microcentrifuge tube with scintillation liquid marked as “retentate”. - Remove 10 μL of filtrate from the collection tube of the filtration device and add it to the second microcentrifuge tube with scintillation liquid marked as “filtrate”. - Vortex for 10 s and proceed with scintillation counting. - From the resulting CPM (Counts per Minute) values, calculate the percentage of protein-bound polyamines using the following formula. Percentage polyamine Binding = {(CPMretentate- CPMfiltrate) / CPMretentate} x 100 ### Timing About 2 hours ### Troubleshooting No Binding: Verify that the protein did not precipitate during the assay. Perform the polyamine binding assay immediately after purification of protein. Strictly avoid freezing and thawing of purified OAZ 1. ### Anticipated Results 1. Binding: CPM in filtrate will be less than retentate - No Binding: CPM in filtrate will be similar to retentate Representative results for spermine and spermidine binding to *S. cerevisiae* OAZ 1 are shown in Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 9 of Kurian et al.
