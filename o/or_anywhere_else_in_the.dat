[...] In February, it was reported that Israel would officially ask the Palestinian Authority to carry out repairs at the tomb, but in response, vandals set tires on fire inside the tomb. In December 2008, Jewish workers funded by anonymous donors painted the blackened walls and re-built the shattered stone marker covering the grave.|$|E

[...] This essay never appeared in the Table-Talk series <b>or</b> <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> author's lifetime. This direct, personal account of a prize fight, commingling refined literary allusions with popular slang, was controversial in its time as depicting too [...] "low" [...] a subject. Written at a dismal time in his life—Hazlitt's divorce was pending, and he was far from sure {{of being able to}} marry Sarah Walker—the article shows scarcely a trace of his agony. Not quite like any other essay by Hazlitt, it proved to be one of his most popular, was frequently reprinted after his death, and nearly two centuries later was judged to be [...] "one of the most passionately written pieces of prose in the late Romantic period".|$|E

2500|$|Dr. Brenda Cossman {{examined}} Big Love {{closely in}} her study of [...] "migrating marriages" [...] for Law and Contemporary Problems. In addition to asserting that [...] "Just as in Big Love, same-sex marriage is never more than one degree away of separation from polygamy," [...] she found that the series adds crucial insight {{to the understanding of}} marriages that exist between legal and cultural recognition. As she explains, [...] "These cases can be seen through the lens of ... Big Love, in which marriages are produced as the culturally real in the here and the now, even when legal recognition remains elusive." [...] By exploring the movement seeking to culturally legitimize same-sex marriage, she concluded Big Love served as a most powerful, unique allegory: [...] "Big Love plays on an even more decisive gap: polygamous marriages are not legal in Utah <b>or</b> <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country. Yet the point and the poignancy of the show is to depict a 'real-life' family. Bill Hendrickson and his three wives struggle with all of the daily trials of contemporary family life: parenting, finances, intimacy, and sex. The sympathetic portrayal of their family is as culturally real, although it suffers by virtue of its nonlegal recognition." ...|$|E
2500|$|Schiffman {{believes}} the passage in Nehemiah is a midrashic interpretation of Lev. 23:40, {{as do the}} Karaites. However, his view is that this interpretation was eventually rejected by [...] "Jewish tradition," [...] i.e., majority practice, {{in favor of the}} Talmudic interpretation of Lev. 23:40 as referring to waving the four species. In contrast to Schiffman, some commentators argue that the verse in Nehemiah cannot be referring to Lev. 23:40, since the language in Nehemiah has some differences from that verse. The pri eitz hadar (fruit of a beautiful tree) and the willow branches are omitted and two species of olive branches are added. [...] It remains unclear according to this interpretation where exactly the scribes in Nehemiah's day [...] "found written in the law" [...] that the Sukkah should be taken from the described species, as no such commandment appears in the books of Moses <b>or</b> <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hebrew Bible. Alternatively, the blogger Beno Freedman has suggested that the expression [...] "pri etz hadar" [...] in Leviticus is actually a typo for [...] "pri etz hahar" [...] - fruit of the mountain tree, and is a general descriptor for the olive and willow branches specified immediately afterwards. This would explain why the [...] "hadar" [...] fruit is not mentioned in Nehemiah, and why the verse in Nehemiah mentions a specific instruction to [...] "go out to the mountain" [...] to fetch the materials for the Sukkah.|$|E
2500|$|On July 23, 2006 the United States Department of the Treasury {{designated}} Abdelrazik as {{a supporter}} of al-Qaeda and a terrorist, [...] "for his high-level ties to and support for al-Qaeda." [...] According to the Globe and Mail, the U.S. State Department believes, [...] "Mr. Abdelrazik was “closely associated with Abu Zubaydah, Osama bin Laden's lieutenant responsible for recruiting and for al-Qaeda's network of training camps in Afghanistan.” The United States also alleges Mr. Abdelrazik recruited and accompanied a Tunisian extremist named Raouf Hannachi for paramilitary training at a camp in Afghanistan in 1996 “where al-Qaeda and other UN-sanctioned terrorist groups were known to train,” and became personally acquainted with Mr. bin Laden". [...] In April 2011, Wikileaks revealed that a November 2008 U.S. Department of Defence document stated that Abdelrazik had admitted receiving $10 000 from alleged al-Qaeda financier Hassan Zemiri, who was captured in late 2001 in Tora Bora, Afghanistan. [...] However, none of these allegations have been proven {{in a court of}} law and Abdelrazik has never been charged with any crime, in Canada <b>or</b> <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world. Eight days after he was designated a terrorist by the US, he was added to the UN Security Council terrorist blacklist (not a no fly list) by the U.S. and is now the only living Canadian on that list. According to the Globe and mail,"any country can nominate anyone they consider to be an islamic extremist. All his personal assets were frozen once he was put on that list. Individuals on the list are subject to a sanctions regime which include an asset freeze and a ban on international travel (but not flight per se). According to a letter sent on April 18, 2008, by the Department of Foreign Affairs to Abousfian Abdelrazik's lawyer, the Canadian government requested the UN's 1267 Committee to remove Abdelrazik from its list of al Qaeda supporters.|$|E

[...] But as she said this, she was herself aware that she had told Mr Whittlestaff only on this morning that she had given her heart to John Gordon, {{and that she would}} be unable to keep her thoughts from running to him. She had implored him to leave her to herself, so that the memory of her love might be spared. Then, when this young man had been still absent, when there was no dream of his appearing again before her, when the consequence would be that she must go forth into the world, and earn her own bitter bread alone,--at that moment she knew that she had been true to the memory of the man. What had occurred since, to alter her purpose so violently? Was it the presence of the man she did love, and the maidenly instincts which forbade her to declare her passion in his presence? Or was it simply the conviction that her promise to Mr Whittlestaff had been twice repeated, and could not now admit of being withdrawn? But in spite of her asseverations, there must have been present to her mind some feeling that if Mr Whittlestaff would yield to the prayer of John Gordon, all the gulf would be bridged over which yawned between herself and perfect happiness.
