Generally, adopters <b>of</b> improved <b>maize</b> variety are about 6 % to 8 % more efficient than non-adopters.

Sublethal doses of imidacloprid in sucrose solution have also been documented to affect homing and foraging activity of honey bees.

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1944 at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, McClintock began {{systematic}} studies on the mechanisms of the mosaic color patterns <b>of</b> <b>maize</b> seed and the unstable inheritance of this mosaicism. She identified two new dominant and interacting genetic loci that she named Dissociator (Ds) and Activator (Ac). She found that the Dissociator did not just dissociate or cause the chromosome to break, it also had a variety of effects on neighboring genes when the Activator was also present, which included making certain stable mutations unstable. In early 1948, she made the surprising discovery that both Dissociator and Activator could transpose, or change position, on the chromosome.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{she made}} an {{extensive}} study of the cytogenetics and ethnobotany <b>of</b> <b>maize</b> races from South America.

The experiments included 5 maize row spacing treatments (D 0 : 0 cm, D 20 : 20 cm, D 40 : 40 cm, D 60 : 60 cm, D 80 : 80 cm),the yield, agronomy traits and growth <b>of</b> intercropped <b>maize</b> were investigated. The results showed that there were no significant effects of row spacing <b>of</b> intercropped <b>maize</b> on yield <b>of</b> intercropped companion crops, row spacing change mainly affected the yield of intercropped maize; the yield <b>of</b> intercropped <b>maize,</b> the total yield of intercropping system and SP (system productivity) under D 60 in 2010 and D 40 in 2014 were the greatest in both intercropping systems. With increasing of row spacing <b>of</b> intercropped <b>maize,</b> SP increased firstly, and then decreased, a inflection appeared at D 60. The ear grain number, the 100 -grains weight and grain weight per plant were significantly affected by different row spacing treatments, the peak value was 132 g&# 183;plant - 1 (D 60) in 2010 and 216 g&# 183;plant - 1 (D 40) in 2014 in wheat/maize intercropping system, and 158 g&# 183;plant - 1 (D 40) in 2010 and 220 g&# 183;plant - 1 (D 40) in 2014 in faba bean/maize intercropping system. The growth rate <b>of</b> intercropped <b>maize</b> during co-growth period was significant lower than those during single growth period, the growth rate under D 40 and D 60 was always greater than other treatments in any sampling period.

5|$|Aboriginal {{cultural}} areas {{depend upon}} their ancestors' primary lifeway, or occupation, {{at the time}} of European contact. These culture areas correspond closely with physical and ecological regions of Canada. The indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast were centred around ocean and river fishing; in the interior of British Columbia, hunter-gatherer and river fishing. In both of these areas the salmon was of chief importance. For the people of the plains, bison hunting was the primary activity. In the subarctic forest, other species such as the moose were more important. For peoples near the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River, shifting agriculture was practised, including the raising <b>of</b> <b>maize,</b> beans, and squash. While for the Inuit, hunting was the primary source of food with seals the primary component of their diet. The caribou, fish, other marine mammals {{and to a lesser extent}} plants, berries and seaweed are part of the Inuit diet.

5|$|Barbara McClintock (June 16, 1902 – September 2, 1992) was an American {{scientist}} and cytogeneticist who {{was awarded the}} 1983 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

From the late 1920s, McClintock studied chromosomes and how they change during reproduction in maize. She developed the technique for visualizing maize chromosomes and used microscopic analysis to demonstrate many fundamental genetic ideas. One of those ideas was the notion of genetic recombination by crossing-over during meiosis—a mechanism by which chromosomes exchange information. She produced the first genetic map for maize, linking regions of the chromosome to physical traits. She demonstrated the role of the telomere and centromere, regions of the chromosome that are important in the conservation of genetic information. She was recognized among the best in the field, awarded prestigious fellowships, and elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1944.|$|E
5|$|Fungi are {{important}} crop pathogens, as they reproduce rapidly, affect {{a wide range}} of crops around the world, cause some 85% of plant diseases, and can create serious economic losses. The range of types of fungi involved is also wide, including Ascomycetes such as Fusarium causing wilt, Basidiomycetes such as Ustilago causing smuts and Puccinia causing cereal rusts, and Oomycetes such as Phytophthora causing potato late blight and the resulting Great Irish Famine of 1845-1849. Where crop diversity is low, and in particular where single varieties of major crops are nearly universal, fungal diseases can cause the loss of an entire crop, as with the potato in Ireland, and as with the monocultured crop <b>of</b> <b>maize</b> (corn) in the USA in 1970, where over a billion dollars' worth of production was lost. Similarly, the 'Gros Michel' seedless banana crop was essentially completely destroyed worldwide in the 1950s by the wild fungus, Fusarium oxysporum. It was replaced by the Cavendish banana, which in turn was in 2015 facing total destruction by the same disease.|$|E
