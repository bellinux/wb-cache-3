5000|$|He {{recognized}} that the discovery of nuclear hyperfine interactions in aromatic free radicals represented a major breakthrough {{in the study of}} the electronic structure of unsaturated hydrocarbons. His theoretical and experimental studies of nuclear hyperfine interactions in such compounds showed conclusively that this interaction gave a measure of the unpaired electron spin densities on the carbon atoms (see McConnell equation for details). His theoretical and experimental investigations of the anisotropic nuclear hyperfine interactions laid a firm foundation for the analysis of the paramagnetic resonance spectra of organic free radicals in. molecular crystals. His work also provided the first experimental demonstration of a negative spin density at a proton. He also realized that certain nitric <b>oxide</b> <b>free</b> radicals had the potential of providing labels for studying molecular motions. His introduction of 'spin labels' has led to a deep understanding of such motions, and to extensive applications in many biological systems of great interest.

Methods: Cerebral venular permeability was measured by using the single-vessel micro-occlusion technique, and fura- 2 ratios were used to track changes in endothelial [Ca 2 +]. Results: Topical acute LPA application dose-dependently increased permeability (log EC 50 - 9. 4; similar to the K-d of the LPA 1 receptor). The calcium response to LPA was similar to histamine, but the permeability response was unaffected by H- 2 -histamine receptor antagonism, and was blocked by Ki 16425, a LPA 1 receptor antagonist. The permeability response was blocked by nitric <b>oxide</b> synthase and <b>free</b> radical scavenging, which were carried out together, but not separately.

As preliminary results, the use of low frequency and intensity induced faster pH decline post mortem and adequate acidification of pH at 3 hours (6. 49 Lot C; 6. 37 Lot A), better muscle glycogen reserve (0. 770 µl/ 50 mL Lot C; 1. 497 µl/ 50 mL Lot A), and lightly more rapid muscle oxidation (IDF: 0. 109 Lot C; 0. 122 Lot A), (FOX: 0. 131 MeqO 2 /kg Lot C; 0. 140 MeqO 2 /kg Lot A). The incidence of individual carcass defects sufficient to cause downgrading or rejection, both in Lot C and Lot A, was generally low.
