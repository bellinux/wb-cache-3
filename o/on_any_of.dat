Around this time Luke Morton had left the band without {{appearing}} <b>on</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> their formal recordings. They released their debut Act of Depression, which sold over 2,000 copies.|$|E
5|$|Along its track, several {{hurricane}} {{warnings and}} watches were issued for the Leeward Islands; however, no damage was reported <b>on</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the islands. The storm has its greatest impact in Bermuda where high winds and near-record rainfall downed trees, {{power lines and}} caused flooding. Damages across the island amounted to $300,000 (1963USD; $2.1million 2009USD).|$|E
5|$|In the Iowa caucuses, Keyes did {{not appear}} <b>on</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the {{election}} totals. Keyes stated {{that many of the}} caucus locations he visited did not list him as a choice. His campaign CEO, Stephen Stone blamed much of this on the media and on Keyes's decision to enter the race late. Stone explained that the media would not acknowledge Keyes's candidacy, making it difficult to run an effective campaign.|$|E

As {{a result of the}} conference, UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali gave General Bernard Janvier, the UN military commander, the authority to request NATO airstrikes without consulting civilian UN officials. The North Atlantic Council, NATO's top political body, and the UN also agreed to use NATO air strikes in response to attacks <b>on</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the other safe areas in Bosnia. The participants at the conference also agreed in principle to the use of large-scale NATO air strikes in response to future acts of Serb aggression.|$|E

5|$|After {{tracking}} eastward {{across the}} Philippines, Linfa reorganized and curved northeastward toward Japan. The Japan Meteorological Agency anticipated heavy precipitation and strong winds {{in the island}} nation's southwestern regions. The agency also warned residents in low-lying areas of potential flooding. The JMA indicated the heightened possibility of landslides in the Tōhoku region due to a recent earthquake in the area. Due to the forecasted impacts and track, as many as 102domestic flights were cancelled in a single day, particularly those associated with southwestern Japan. In addition, five ferry services were cancelled. Upon making landfall on Shikoku, Linfa became the first tropical cyclone since 1965 to strike Japan during May, {{as well as the}} third earliest tropical cyclone to make landfall <b>on</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> Japan's four main islands since standardized records began in 1951.|$|E

At the time, the maximum cost of a trip <b>on</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the rail networks except the Airport Express and first class of the MTR East Rail line was HK$34.8, the cost of travelling between East Tsim Sha Tsui Station and Lo Wu Station; the current maximum cost is HK$55.3, the cost of travelling between Disneyland Resort Station and either Lo Wu Station or Lok Ma Chau Station.|$|E
5|$|As Thompson began porting {{the game}} to the new system, {{he decided not to}} base the code <b>on</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the {{existing}} software for the computer, and instead write his own. As a result, he implemented his own base code libraries for programs to use, including arithmetic packages and graphics subsystems. These initial subsystems were coded in assembly language on the GECOS system and assembled, then the output physically put on punched tapes to be carried over and inserted into the PDP-7. Thompson then wrote an assembler for the PDP-7 to avoid this laborious process. The game ran very slowly on the new machine, causing Thompson to branch out from there to design his own file system based on some ideas by Dennis Ritchie and Rudd Canaday, rooted in their experience with the Multics file system, with which he then ran Space Travel.|$|E

5|$|Cope {{sold his}} {{collections}} to the American Museum of Natural History in 1895; his set of 10,000American fossil mammals sold for $32,000, lower than Cope's asking price of $50,000. The purchase was {{financed by the}} donations from New York's high society. Cope sold three other collections for $29,000. While his collection contained more than 13,000specimens, Cope's fossil hoard was still much smaller than Marsh's collection, valued at over a milliondollars. The University of Pennsylvania bought part of Cope's ethnological artifact collection for $5,500. The Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia's foremost museum, did not bid <b>on</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> Cope's sales due to bad blood between Cope and the museum's leaders; as a result, many of Cope's major finds left the city. Cope's proceeds from the sales allowed him to rehire Sternberg to prospect for fossils on his behalf.|$|E
5|$|For Walther, at the bridge, the {{position}} appeared defensible {{for as long}} as it would take to remove Ney's force through Winterthur, yet the shock of the Austrian force, as it hit his defences, was sufficient to break his line after 90 minutes of brisk fighting. But there the Austrian forward momentum stalled. Although Hotze's men forced Walther's from the bridge, they themselves could not cross it. From the ridge, Ney's rear guard maintained a steady stream of cannon fire <b>on</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the Austrians who crossed the bridge and attempted to advance up the hill. Hotze recognised the futility of throwing his men into direct cannon fire and ordered instead a steady musketry barrage. This proved effective, for Ney was again injured, this time in his left hand, and his second horse was killed; he relinquished command to Gazan, who organised the continued withdrawal from {{the position}}.|$|E

5|$|Governor Crittenden {{resigned}} on July 31, 1850 {{to accept}} President Millard Fillmore's appointment as attorney general, and Helm ascended to the governorship. As governor, Helm vetoed a legislative plan to cover deficits {{in the public}} school fund by drawing money from the state's sinking fund, but the General Assembly overrode the veto. He urged the legislature to fund a survey of the state's mineral reserves and a census of the state's agricultural and manufacturing resources. He called for spending on internal improvements and for raising judges' salaries to attract more qualified jurists to the bench. He also sought a ban on the carrying of concealed deadly weapons. The legislature did not act <b>on</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> these proposed reforms. The only part of Helm's agenda that did progress through the General Assembly was election reform.|$|E
5|$|However, in Berlin Meyerbeer faced many problems, {{including}} the enmity of the jealous Gaspare Spontini, who since 1820 had been Court Kapellmeister {{and director of}} the Berlin Hofoper. Complaints were made in the Berlin press about the delay of the Berlin premiere of Robert le diable (which finally took place in June 1832), and Meyerbeer's music was decried by the critic and poet Ludwig Rellstab. There was no sign of the German opera expected from Meyerbeer. Moreover, reactionary censorship laws prevented production of Les Huguenots in Berlin, (and indeed in many other cities of Germany). Nevertheless, Meyerbeer, who (as he wrote to a friend) 'years ago...swore to myself never to respond personally to attacks on my work, and never under any circumstances to cause or respond to personal polemics', refused to be drawn <b>on</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> these matters.|$|E

Near the Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport, the Interstate passes into the southeastern corner of Kalamazoo before entering Comstock Township. The freeway intersects {{the eastern end of}} the business loop at a partial interchange near Morrow Lake in the township. I-94 continues out of the eastern Kalamazoo suburbs, paralleling the Kalamazoo River through the Galesburg area.

5|$|Numerous {{calls were}} made to police in the United States Virgin Islands about downed power lines {{throughout}} {{the passage of the}} depression. High winds, gusting up to 40mph (65km/h) left roughly 500 people without telephone service on St. Croix. No major damage was reported <b>on</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the affected islands in the wake of Christine. Residents in the drought-stricken regions of Florida were hoping for increased rainfall from the remnant wave of Christine; however, the system did not reach the United States before dissipating. The storm's remnants only produced squally weather in Florida on September7 and 8.|$|E
5|$|The SL95s make up 32 of the 72 trams in the system, supplementing {{the older}} SL79.

Since line 13 is a continuation of line 17 at Sinsen, the SL95s also operate on that line. Due to a too-small curve radius on the Briskeby Line, the SL95s do not operate <b>on</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the lines to Majorstuen.
