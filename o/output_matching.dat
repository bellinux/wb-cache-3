40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the use of}} a new structure of active inductor named cascoded flipped-active inductor (CASFAI) in a T-type high-pass tunable <b>output</b> <b>matching</b> network of a class-E RF power amplifier (RFPA) to control the output power and enhance the efficiency. The designed CASFAI behaves as an inductor in the frequency range of 0 – 6. 9 GHz, and has reached to a maximum quality factor of 4406, inductance value of 7. 56 nH, 3 rd order harmonic distortion better than - 30 dB for 0 dBm input power, while consumes only 2 mW power. In order to consider the performance of the proposed active inductor-based tunable <b>output</b> <b>matching</b> network on the output power level and power added efficiency (PAE) of RFPA, the CASFAI is applied as a variable inductor to the <b>output</b> <b>matching</b> network of RFPA. The overall circuit is designed and validated in ADS in a 0. 18 µm CMOS process and 1. 5 V supply voltage. The results indicate that by increasing the inductance value of the matching network in constant operating frequency, the PAE peak moves from high power to low power levels without any degradation. Therefore, it is possible to maintain the power efficiency at the same maximum level for lower input drive levels. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft...|$|E
