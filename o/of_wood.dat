5|$|By this point, the Noel Park {{development}} and the growing nearby community <b>of</b> <b>Wood</b> Green were coming to dominate the area.

5|$|The {{forms of}} the glyphs are {{standardized}} contours of living organisms and geometric designs about one centimeter high. The wooden tablets are irregular in shape and, in many instances, fluted (tablets B, E, G, H, O, Q, and possibly T), with the glyphs carved in shallow channels running {{the length of the}} tablets, {{as can be seen in}} the image of tablet G at right. It is thought that irregular and often blemished pieces <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> were used in their entirety rather than squared off due to the scarcity <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> on the island.|$|E

5|$|By 1910, most glacial {{acetic acid}} was {{obtained}} from the pyroligneous liquor, a product of the distillation <b>of</b> <b>wood.</b> The acetic acid was isolated by treatment with milk of lime, and the resulting calcium acetate was then acidified with sulfuric acid to recover acetic acid. At that time, Germany was producing 10,000 tons of {{glacial acetic acid}}, around 30% of which was used for the manufacture of indigo dye.|$|E
5|$|Bynesian decay usually starts when {{specimens}} {{are stored}} or displayed for considerable {{periods of time}} in an enclosed space. The storage method itself usually causes this problem, when containers, cabinets or display cases are entirely or partially made <b>of</b> <b>wood,</b> plywood or other wood products such as Masonite, or when the specimens are surrounded by, or in contact with, various other kinds of materials that are cellulose-based and can turn water vapor acidic.|$|E
5|$|Charcoal {{can be made}} by slow {{pyrolysis}} <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> by heating it in {{the absence}} of air in a kiln.

Charcoal is used as a fuel in barbecues and by blacksmiths and has many industrial and other uses.|$|E

5|$|Compatibility {{tests as}} well as {{molecular}} analysis indicated that A.areolatum separated very early from other Amylostereum fungi. The other three species separated later {{from each other and}} are thus partially compatible to each other. A.ferreum and A.laevigatum produced in 59% of all cases a common mycelium, A.ferreum and A.chailletii only in 44%. There is an undescribed species in Amylostereum; according to DNA analysis, it stands between A.laevigatum and A.ferreum. This is remarkable, as these fungi originated from Mycetangae (storing organs of Platypodinae) of a North American wood wasp, while A.laevigatum has never been seen as symbiont <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> wasps, neither in North American nor in Europe. The fungus possibly represents a separated species or a subtaxon of A.laevigatum. As A.areolatum and A.chailletii mainly reproduce asexually through the symbiosis <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> wasps, the genetic variability within these species is relatively low.|$|E
