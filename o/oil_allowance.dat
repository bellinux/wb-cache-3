40|$|Sesame (Sesamum indicum), an {{important}} oil crop, is widely grown in tropical and subtropical regions. It provides {{part of the}} daily edible <b>oil</b> <b>allowance</b> for {{almost half of the}} world’s population. A limited number of co-dominant markers has been developed and applied in sesame genetic diversity and germplasm identity studies. Here we report {{for the first time a}} whole genome survey used to develop simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and to detect the genetic diversity of sesame germplasm. From the initial assembled sesame genome, 23, 438 SSRs (≥ 5 repeats) were identified. The most common repeat motif was dinucleotide with a frequency of 84. 24 %, followed by 13. 53 % trinucleotide, 1. 65 % tetranucleotide, 0. 3 % pentanucleotide and 0. 28 % hexanucleotide motifs. From 1500 designed and synthesised primer pairs, 218 polymorphic SSRs were developed and used to screen 31 sesame accessions that from 12 countries. STRUCTURE and phylogenetic analyses indicated that all sesame accessions could be divided into two groups: one mainly from China and another from other countries. Cluster analysis classified Chinese major sesame varieties into three groups. These novel SSR markers are a useful tool for genetic linkage map construction, genetic diversity detection, and marker-assisted selective sesame breeding...|$|E

40|$|Hollywood’s {{greatest}} stars did {{not only}} produce blockbusters, but were savvy businessmen who also produced oil gushers. These stars invested in oil interests {{in order to}} shelter {{a large part of}} their income from the rapidly rising income tax rates of the 1930 s. The unique tax benefit they used was the percentage <b>oil</b> depletion <b>allowance,</b> part of the Revenue Act of 1926, which allowed an oil company to reduce its taxable income by 27 ½ percent. By the 1950 s, many Hollywood individuals and corporations extensively invested in the oil business which made the allowance an important component of their financial portfolios. Meanwhile, rich oilmen were also attracted to Hollywood to capitalize on a big hit, or use the losses on a money losing movie to offset their taxable profits from oil. Thus, in the mid-twentieth century, the American oil industry and Hollywood formed a close, mutually reinforcing relationship, and one that academic historians have largely overlooked. After the 1973 oil shock, the percentage depletion allowance came under threat as it was repealed for major integrated oil companies. To protect the allowance for the non-integrated independent producers, Hollywood found their political patron in the famous Hollywood actor and Republican president, Ronald Reagan. As president, Reagan ardently defended the retention of the allowance during his term in the 1980 s. Hollywood’s role in the oil industry developed from being a few casual investors using the <b>oil</b> depletion <b>allowance</b> into a substantial oil industry participant and a major political defender of oil-specific tax provisions...|$|R
50|$|Brown & Root {{continued}} to pour money into Lyndon Johnson's career, not just making massive contributions to Johnson's campaign funds but also making (and causing their subcontractors and others beholden {{to them to}} make) unusually large political contributions to enable Johnson to manipulate and influence {{other members of the}} House and Senate to obtain further huge contracts and other benefits (such as continuing the <b>oil</b> depletion <b>allowance</b> and the pricing of natural gas) for Johnson's friends in business. According to Tracy Kidder's book Mountains Beyond Mountains, Brown & Root was a contractor in the Péligre Dam project.

500|$|Voorhis often {{opposed the}} {{petroleum}} industry, questioning {{the need for}} the <b>oil</b> depletion <b>allowance.</b> In 1943, he was told by a Pasadena attorney that the Navy Department was planning to grant Standard Oil exclusive free drilling rights in the vast Elk Hills naval reserve in central California, then thought to be the richest oil reserve outside the Arabian Peninsula. The congressman in a speech from the House floor in May 1943 exposed the deal, which was soon cancelled. The Washington Post hailed him as a hero, and House Naval Affairs Committee Chairman Carl Vinson of Georgia stated that Voorhis had performed [...] "the greatest kind of service". However, the Los Angeles Times suggested that Voorhis had harmed the war effort by depriving the people of California of gasoline. In 1945, Voorhis fought a bill which would have given oil companies offshore drilling rights. The petroleum industry journal Second Issue blamed the defeat of the bill on Voorhis. Nixon biographer Roger Morris suggested that these stands led oil companies to give Nixon substantial, but surreptitious, financial assistance during the 1946 campaign against Voorhis.|$|R

40|$|This is {{a history}} of the {{independent}} oilmen of Texas, whose money financed the book. The great oil discoveries in Texas-Anthony Lucas 2 ̆ 7 s at Spindletop, 1901, and C. M. 2 ̆ 2 Dad 2 ̆ 2 Joiner 2 ̆ 7 s in the East Texas field, 1930, among others-were made and developed by small operators because the major companies did not believe the oil was there. Many farmers 2 ̆ 7 lands remained unleased until oil had already been discovered nearby. Thus oil production and royalties, especially in Texas, the author asserts, were 2 ̆ 2 massively democratized. 2 ̆ 2 Eventually the small operators organized the Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association, whose policies sometimes deviated from those of the giant companies. TIPRO was perhaps most effective in the 1970 s in persuading Congress to keep the <b>oil</b> depletion <b>allowance</b> for the independents while the majors were losing it.

5000|$|In 2003, {{researcher}} Barr McClellan {{published the}} book Blood, Money & Power. McClellan claims that Johnson, {{motivated by the}} fear of being dropped from the Kennedy ticket in 1964 and the need to cover up various scandals, masterminded Kennedy's assassination {{with the help of his}} friend, Austin attorney Edward A. Clark. The book suggests that a smudged partial fingerprint from the sniper's nest likely belonged to Johnson's associate Malcolm [...] "Mac" [...] Wallace, and that Mac Wallace was, therefore, on the sixth floor of the Depository at the time of the shooting. The book further claims that the killing of Kennedy was paid for by oil magnates, including Clint Murchison and H. L. Hunt. McClellan states that the assassination of Kennedy allowed the <b>oil</b> depletion <b>allowance</b> to be kept at 27.5 percent. It remained unchanged during the Johnson presidency. According to McClellan, this resulted in a saving of over $100 million to the American oil industry. McClellan's book subsequently became the subject of an episode of Nigel Turner's ongoing documentary television series, The Men Who Killed Kennedy. The episode, [...] "The Guilty Men", drew angry condemnation from the Johnson family, Johnson's former aides, and former Presidents Gerald Ford (who was a member of the Warren Commission [...] ) and Jimmy Carter following its airing on The History Channel. The History Channel assembled a committee of historians who concluded the accusations in the documentary were without merit, and The History Channel apologized to the Johnson family and agreed not to air the series in the future.|$|R
