5|$|The {{performance}} of Rebecca {{seems to me}} to have taken us further into the danger area instead of showing any improvement. I am unable to defend at a time when departmental costs and scene loads are in an acute state the load imposed by Rebecca on Design and Supply and the expenditure upon extras and costumes... the vast area of the hall and the stairway never justified the great expenditure of effort required in building and one is left with a very clear impression of reaching a point where the department must be accused <b>of</b> <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> what it is doing.|$|E
5|$|After Zainab and Jane {{argue in}} the street Zainab and Yusef return home. Zainab slaps Yusef after he says Kamil will be an outcast to him but Yusef slaps Zainab back. Yusef then hastily {{arranges}} a flight for himself, Zainab and Kamil to Pakistan, but Zainab purposefully discards her passport to prevent the trip. Yusef then kidnaps Kamil, telling Zainab that he is being kept {{in a safe place}} and refuses to let Zainab see him. After about four days <b>of</b> <b>not</b> <b>knowing,</b> Yusef takes Zainab to a café in the High Street, where a relative returns Kamil to Zainab. During the visit, it emerges that Yusef told Bushra's family that Zainab had a nervous breakdown, which is why he needed to have Kamil looked after. When Yusef takes a call outside the café, Zainab tries to escape with Kamil through an emergency exit {{in the back of the}} shop. However, Yusef guessed her plan and was waiting for her outside the exit. As she tried to escape, Yusef warned her that he knows everything, and if she leaves him, he will kill Tamwar and Kamil. Masood races to the restaurant and secretly promises that he'll do whatever it takes to get her out of her marriage to Yusef. Zainab finally stands up to Yusef and refuses to leave for Pakistan. Yusef attacks her and after learning that Masood has Kamil, retaliates towards Yusef. Yusef drugs Zainab, and the family return to the house. Masood punches Yusef before calling the police. Afia confronts Yusef and orders him to leave. Yusef is later found by Masood at the bed and breakfast with a match and some petrol. Yusef attacks Masood and lights a fire leaving Masood for dead. Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) and Christian put the fire out but the fire is later reignited trapping Masood, Phil and Denise inside. Yusef taunts Zainab outside. Zainab lies and tells him that Afia is in the building and he runs in followed by Tamwar. Masood is later rescued and as Yusef remains upstairs he realises that Afia is in fact outside. Realising Zainab tricked him, he briefly smiles, and the floor collapses beneath him and he succumbs to the flames, killing him. The following day, firefighters retrieve his body. He leaves everything to Zainab in his will.|$|E

25|$|The twentieth-century British {{psychoanalyst}} Wilfred Bion elaborated on Keats's term {{to illustrate}} {{an attitude of}} openness of mind which he considered of central importance, {{not only in the}} psychoanalytic session, but in life itself. For Bion, negative capability was the ability to tolerate the pain and confusion <b>of</b> <b>not</b> <b>knowing,</b> rather than imposing ready-made or omnipotent certainties upon an ambiguous situation or emotional challenge. His idea has been taken up more widely in the British Independent School, as well as elsewhere in psychoanalysis and psychotherapy.|$|E
25|$|Parallels {{have been}} drawn between the Visitors and US Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, though Peters and co-producer Jeffrey Bell refute that they were intentional. Bell feels that while the {{original}} series {{was more of a}} military show with a clear enemy, the reimagining focuses more on the paranoia <b>of</b> <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> who can be trusted. The episode incorporates aspects of the original series, including the Visitors' giant spaceships, but is quick to reveal the Visitors' true motivations, as Peters felt awareness of the original story was already high.|$|E

25|$|Storm chasing is chiefly a {{recreational}} endeavor, with motives usually given toward photographing or videoing {{the storm and}} for multivariate personal reasons. These can include the beauty of views afforded by the sky and land, the mystery <b>of</b> <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> precisely what will unfold and the quest to undetermined destination on the open road, intangible experiences such as feeling one with a much larger and powerful natural world, the challenge of correctly forecasting and intercepting storms with the optimal vantage points, and pure thrill seeking.

25|$|Following Sun Quan's {{death in}} May 252, the Grand Tutor Zhuge Ke, {{who had been}} {{appointed}} regent for Sun Quan's youngest son and successor, Sun Liang, proposed to the imperial court to move the nobles away from areas with a heavy military presence. He thus relocated Sun Fen from Wuchang to Yuzhang Commandery (豫章郡; around present-day Nanchang, Jiangxi). However, Sun Fen turned furious {{when he heard about}} it and refused to move out of Wuchang. Zhuge Ke wrote a long letter to Sun Fen to warn him about the perils <b>of</b> <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> his place and to remind him of the downfall of his fourth brother, Sun Ba, the Prince of Lu.|$|E
25|$|Experts on {{the ground}} in Japan agree that mental health {{challenges}} are the most significant issue. Stress, such as that caused by dislocation, uncertainty and concern about unseen toxicants, often manifests in physical ailments, such as heart disease. So even if radiation risks are low, people are still concerned and worried. Behavioral changes can follow, including poor dietary choices, lack of exercise and sleep deprivation, all of which can have long-term negative health consequences. People who lost their homes, villages and family members, and even just those who survived the quake, will likely continue to face mental health challenges and the physical ailments that come with stress. Much of the damage was really the psychological stress <b>of</b> <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> and of being relocated, according to U.C. Berkeley's McKone.|$|E

25|$|The {{idea of a}} {{planetary}} collision was inspired by websites with theories about such events. Von Trier decided from the outset {{that it would be}} clear from the beginning that the world would actually end in the film, so audiences would not be distracted by the suspense <b>of</b> <b>not</b> <b>knowing.</b> The concept of the two sisters as main characters developed via an exchange of letters between von Trier and the Spanish actress Penélope Cruz. Cruz wrote that she would like to work with von Trier, and spoke enthusiastically about the play The Maids by Jean Genet. As von Trier subsequently tried to write a role for the actress, the two maids from the play evolved into the sisters Justine and Claire in Melancholia. Much of the personality of the character Justine was based on von Trier himself. The name was inspired by the 1791 novel Justine by Marquis de Sade.|$|E
25|$|Amnesty {{also reports}} {{allegations}} of abuse of suspects during these interrogations. There {{are reports of}} physical abuse, sleep deprivation and denial of food, water and use of a toilet. One of its biggest criticisms is that inmates usually remain for years (and sometimes decades) on death row without ever actually being informed of the date of their execution prior to the date itself, so inmates suffer due to the uncertainty <b>of</b> <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> whether or not any given day will be their last. According to Amnesty International, the intense and prolonged stress means many inmates on death row have poor mental health, suffering from the so-called death row phenomenon. The failure to give advanced notice of executions has been stated by the United Nations Human Rights Committee to be incompatible with articles 2, 7 and 10 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.|$|E
25|$|Nessler was {{initially}} joined on the broadcasts by color commentator Bill Walton and lead sideline reporter Michele Tafoya. The team of Nessler and Walton did two broadcasts together before ABC decided that Walton needed a partner (much {{like he had}} at NBC with Steve Jones) and assigned pre-game analyst Tom Tolbert to join the team. Nessler, Walton and Tolbert called most regular season games, and every network playoff game. Other games were called by the team of Brent Musburger and Sean Elliott. After suffering the worst ratings in NBA Finals history for the 2003 series, low ratings overall, and harsh criticism, ABC decided to retool the team. More to the point, during this particular period, Brad Nessler was accused by media analysts (among them, New York Times columnist Richard Sandomir) <b>of</b> <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> game strategy well, lacking rhythm and enthusiasm in his game call, not bringing {{out the best in}} his partners, too often ignoring the score and his tendency to stammer.|$|E

500|$|Filatov {{was also}} the first overall {{selection}} in the 2008 Canadian Hockey League Import Draft, selected by the Sudbury Wolves of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL). Sudbury General Manager Mike Foligno was comfortable with the risks <b>of</b> <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> whether Filatov would play at junior or professional level when he came to North America. Blue Jackets General Manager Scott Howson would not guarantee Filatov a place on their team, saying, [...] "We've already told Nikita that we'll see how things go in training camp and we'll decide what's best for him." ...|$|E
500|$|Harry Thompson noted that, like Red Rackham's Treasure, Prisoners of the Sun was [...] "an epic journey {{conditioned}} by the suspense <b>of</b> <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> {{what will happen}} at the end"; although he thought that, unlike Red Rackham's Treasure, it [...] "successfully transfers the fear of its unknown adversaries from {{the first part of}} the adventure into the second". He also thought that, despite all the tribulations Hergé faced while creating it, [...] "the pacing, the retention of suspense right to the end, and the fine balance of humour and drama" [...] do not betray the story's troubled development.|$|E
500|$|Blitz {{believed}} that Hal's stuttering was {{a metaphor for}} his lack of mastery of life and love: [...] "He can't control this thing {{that ought to be}} so simple... And so much of his life is like that." [...] Journalist Mark Baumer highlighted the juxtaposition of Hal with the fast-talking debaters, who are at opposite ends of the spectrum with their speech but are both struggling with communication and expression. Blitz said that [...] "Even when [...] can speak incredibly fast and are packing their sentences with tons of SAT words, they still don't know exactly what they're talking about. There is still a question about whether their content of what they're talking about matches up with what they're feeling or trying to express. Whether it's the kid who's talking a million miles an hour, but saying nothing or the kid who isn't able to get out any word at all they're both at the mercy <b>of</b> <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> how to express what's inside them." ...|$|E

500|$|Krasinski {{received}} a haircut due to production on another film, Leatherheads (2008), which he thought [...] "ended up working perfectly" [...] {{for the season}} finale. Co-creator Greg Daniels had wanted Jim to get a haircut for a while, as {{he thought it would}} [...] "change [...] up a little bit." [...] Krasinski thought it was [...] "really smart" [...] to make it seem like Karen's idea. Kwapis was careful with Jim's reaction shots in the episode, as {{he did not want to}} [...] "tip anything" [...] to the audience about Jim's choice of Karen or Pam. Kwapis explained, [...] "That to me was actually one of the big challenges of the episode is how to keep you on your toes in terms <b>of</b> <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> where the story was going." [...] Jim's flashback scene with Pam on the beach was initially intended to be the cold open of the episode before Michael Schur suggested it be moved. Kwapis shot multiple endings, and the cast was unaware how the season would end.|$|E
500|$|Abbott {{initially}} {{created the}} game Confusion in the 1970s, {{and had it}} in finished form by 1980. The game was published in Germany by Franjos in 1992; Abbott was not satisfied with this version, however, due to several flaws in it. The rules {{were published in the}} Spanish translation of his book Abbott's New Card Games in 2008, but the game did not get published in North America until 2011. This Stronghold Games version was named [...] "Best New Abstract Strategy Game" [...] for 2012 by GAMES Magazine. The game is based on the idea <b>of</b> <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> what your pieces are or what they do {{at the beginning of the}} game. His game Eleusis uses a similar idea, in that you do not know how cards are to be played at the beginning; George Brancaccio, someone Abbott worked with at the Bank of New York, commented on this, saying [...] "In your game Eleusis, you don't know what cards can be played. Why don't you make a board game where you don't know how pieces move?" [...] This is what gave Abbott the idea, and he began work on it soon after.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} critics who viewed the episode when it aired were equally taken with [...] "Asian F". The Atlantic Kevin Fallon called it Glee [...] "best ever", while others, {{including}} Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone and Abby West of Entertainment Weekly {{said it was}} the best one of the new third season. Vanity Fair Brett Berk wrote, [...] "This week's episode stands out {{as one of the most}} cohesive and well acted in the series's pantheon", though he wondered what had happened to the show's humorous side, something also noted by Futterman, who found it to be a significant problem: [...] "Glee's own identity crisis <b>of</b> <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> whether or not it's a sitcom has made it hard to get deeply invested in its characters." [...] Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times wrote that [...] "the producers hit every note (emotional, musical, character, plot) as squarely as Rachel Berry auditioning for a coveted role", and the episode [...] "had emotional truth, character growth, new revelations and really good musical numbers: the kind that seem to emerge organically from the plot and deepen and advance it." [...] AOLTV Crystal Bell said the episode delivered on the setup in the previous [...] "I Am Unicorn" [...] outing, and said [...] "it definitely seems to echo the glory days" [...] of the first season. TV Guide later included [...] "Asian F" [...] in its list of 2011's Top TV Episodes.|$|E
