500|$|Later on, {{the protagonist}} {{encounters}} a hostile and unstable female apparition, presumably named Lisa, and {{upon entering the}} bathroom and being locked, he obtains a flashlight and finds a creature resembling an underdeveloped fetus crying in the sink. He soon gets out, but finds out that the apparition is watching him. If the protagonist is attacked by the ghost, he reawakens in the first room of the game, beginning the loop again, but it's possible to avoid her completely. In the room, a bloody moving paper bag speaks to him, speaking of a disturbing experience, and stating the same quote seen {{at the start of}} the game - [...] "Watch out. The gap in the door... it's a separate reality. The <b>only</b> <b>me</b> is me. Are you sure the only you is you?" ...|$|E
500|$|MacDonald {{cites the}} lyrics to the first bridge – [...] "But if I seem to act unkind / It's <b>only</b> <b>me,</b> it's not my mind / That is {{confusing}} things" [...] – {{as an example of}} Harrison applying an Eastern philosophical approach to difficulties in communication, by presenting them as [...] "contradictions between different levels of being". In Laing's interpretation, the entities [...] "me" [...] and [...] "my mind" [...] represent, respectively, [...] "individualistic, selfish ego" [...] and [...] "the Buddhist not-self, freed from the anxieties of historical Time". In I, Me, Mine, however, Harrison states that, with hindsight, the order of [...] "me" [...] and [...] "my mind" [...] should be reversed, since: [...] "The mind is the thing that hops about telling us to do this and do that – when what we need is to lose (forget) the mind." ...|$|E
500|$|Several critics {{interpreted}} the song's lyrics during their reviews. Its theme was noted {{to be about}} freedom. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard {{said that in the}} song, Lee is [...] "trying to convince a romantic partner to stop 'spiraling down, down, down' and help her find a new beginning." [...] Kerrang! writer Steve Beebee wrote that Lee reaches a conclusion that [...] "Love will guide you home." [...] Talking about the lyrical content of the song, Laurie Tuffrey of NME opined: [...] "It's quite hard to tell what the song's about, with lots of references to 'the unknown' and 'the pain', and it confusingly switches between suggesting people 'do what you want you want, if you have a dream for better' in the first verse and the decidedly creepier final chorus where Lee seemingly gets an ex-lover on the blower, only to tell them 'Hello, hello, it’s <b>only</b> <b>me,</b> infecting everything you love'." ...|$|E

500|$|Swift {{received}} much {{success with the}} release of her self-titled debut album Taylor Swift (2006), and began working on her second studio album, Fearless (2008), in 2007. During that time, she received a number of e-mails from fans requesting for new material to be released, which drove Swift into releasing Beautiful Eyes: [...] "I thought this might tide them over till the new album comes out in the fall." [...] Beautiful Eyes is musically oriented to country pop and contemporary music. It includes new versions of tracks from Taylor Swift: an alternate version of [...] "Should've Said No", the fifth single from the album, an acoustic version of [...] "Teardrops on My Guitar", the second single from the album, a radio edit of [...] "Picture to Burn", the fourth single from the album, and [...] "I'm <b>Only</b> <b>Me</b> when I'm with You", a promotional single from the album. The EP also features two original songs, [...] "Beautiful Eyes" [...] and [...] "I Heart Question Mark", which she previously wrote in 2003. The EP's DVD features music videos from the singles from Taylor Swift, as well as a music video made for [...] "Beautiful Eyes" [...] from footage from Swift's eighteenth birthday party.|$|E
500|$|Flight 367 {{departed}} from Stockholm Arlanda Airport at 1:30p.m. on 26 January. The aircraft, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9, landed at Copenhagen Airport at 2:30p.m., {{where it was}} taken over by Vulović and her colleagues. [...] "As it was late, we were in the terminal and saw it park," [...] Vulović said. [...] "I saw all the passengers and crew deplane. One man seemed terribly annoyed. It was not <b>only</b> <b>me</b> that noticed him either. Other crew members saw him, as did the station manager in Copenhagen. I think it was the man who put the bomb in the baggage. I think he had checked in a bag in Stockholm, got off in Copenhagen and never re-boarded the flight." [...] Flight 367 {{departed from}} Copenhagen Airport at 3:15p.m. At 4:01p.m., an explosion tore through the DC-9's baggage compartment. The explosion caused the aircraft to break apart mid-air over the Czechoslovak village of Srbská Kamenice. Vulović {{was the only one of}} the 28 passengers and crew to survive the crash. She was discovered by a villager named Bruno Honke, who heard her screaming amid the wreckage. Her turquoise uniform was covered in blood and her [...] stiletto heels had been torn off by the force of the impact. Honke had been a medic during World War II and was able to keep her alive until rescuers arrived at the scene.|$|E
500|$|Taylor Swift was {{released}} on October 24, 2006 with eleven tracks. Swift was highly involved in the album packaging, designing doodle graphics herself. She also personally capitalized specific letters in the lyrics from each song to spell out hidden messages, a feat she would also execute for her succeeding albums. On November 6, 2007, the album was re-released under the title Taylor Swift Deluxe Edition for a limited time. The deluxe edition contained three new songs: [...] "I'm <b>Only</b> <b>Me</b> When I'm with You", [...] "Invisible" [...] and [...] "A Perfectly Good Heart", the radio edits for [...] "Teardrops on My Guitar", and [...] "Our Song", and Swift's first phone conversation with Tim McGraw. The re-release also bared new artwork and a bonus DVD with all of Swift's music videos at the time ("Tim McGraw", [...] "Teardrops on My Guitar", and [...] "Our Song"), behind-the-scenes footage of [...] "Teardrops on My Guitar" [...] and [...] "Our Song" [...] music videos, and a performance of [...] "Picture to Burn", among other material. The American retail company Target released an exclusive version of Taylor Swift Deluxe Edition, with performances of Swift during McGraw and Hill's Soul2Soul II Tour. A third and final re-release appeared on March 18, 2008 with the original album artwork, including the three new songs from the Taylor Swift Deluxe Edition, {{as well as the}} radio edit of [...] "Picture to Burn," [...] and an additional pop remix of [...] "Teardrops on My Guitar". This version of the album was also released on vinyl in 2016. A karaoke version of Taylor Swift {{was released}} on January 27, 2009, containing the first fourteen tracks from the album on both CD+G and DVD.|$|E

2500|$|The {{last two}} lines of the sonnet is the couplet. Shakespeare starts with saying [...] "but thou art my art." [...] According to Vendler, [...] "the phonetically and grammatically tautological pun — 'Thou art all my art ' — which conflates the copula and its {{predicate}} noun, enacts that plain mutual render, <b>only</b> <b>me</b> for thee (125) [...] aspired to by the Sonnets and enacts as well the poet's simplicity contrasted with the affectations of the learned." [...] Once again, we see that Vendler is comparing and connecting sonnet 78 to another one of Shakespeare's sonnets, sonnet 125.|$|E
2500|$|In August, November and December 1887 respectively, {{the first}} three volumes of the {{collection}} Novellas and Short Stories by N. S. Leskov were published. At the 1888 New Year party at Alexei Suvorin's, Leskov met Anton Chekhov for the first time. Soon Ilya Repin became Leskov's friend and illustrator. Several months later in a letter, asking Leskov to sit for him, Repin explained his motives: [...] "Not <b>only</b> <b>me</b> but the whole of enlightened Russia loves you as an outstanding, distinguished writer and as a thinking man." [...] The sittings early the next year were aborted: Leskov was unwilling to have his portrait seen at a forthcoming exhibition of Repin's works.|$|E

2500|$|Christopher Hitchens {{points to}} a {{statement}} by former counterterrorism chief Richard Clarke when interviewed by The Hill newspaper in May 2004, in which [...] "he, and he alone, took the responsibility for authorizing [...] Saudi departures." [...] Hitchens says that Moore interviewed Clarke and [...] "either he didn't ask Clarke, who authorized those flights, or Clarke {{told him it was}} me and <b>only</b> <b>me,</b> and he didn't think it was good enough to use. ... Either way, that's below the level of trash TV, trash journalism." [...] After quitting his White House position, Clarke became a prominent critic of the Bush administration's war on terrorism. Hitchens contends that the film does not mention Clarke's remarks so that it can criticize Bush for not going after Bin Laden's family, while holding up Clarke as a heroic, anti-war figure.|$|E

2500|$|Philip McGuire {{believes}} {{this type of}} free verse is meaningful. McGuire argues that Shakespeare, with his variation in verse, is claiming to not be a [...] "dweller on form" [...] (line 5) and [...] "free" [...] (line 10) from the repetitive form of the traditional [...] "English sonnet", adding to the symbolism contained in the lines. McGuire also states that {{the speaker of the}} sonnet exclaims that his [...] "oblation" [...] (line 10 [...] ) to his beloved is [...] "poor but free" [...] (line 10) and [...] "knows no art/, But mutual render, <b>only</b> <b>me</b> for thee" [...] (lines 11-12) which directly pertains to the rhyme scheme, as rhyme in itself is [...] "mutual render" [...] (line 12), dependent on two separate words to exist. The speaker states that his art is [...] "poor but free", [...] "poor" [...] in a sense that it is missing one of the perfect seven rhymes found in typical sonnet structure, but has only six, an imperfect structure missing an important piece, alluding to the mindset of the speaker in his loss of the Fair Youth's affections, directly corresponding to the [...] "mutual render" [...] embodied in the rhyme scheme and the [...] "mutual render" [...] he feels towards his beloved. In effect, the atypical character of the [...] "mutual render" [...] binding the a rhymes of sonnet 125 is a literal testimony of the selfless generosity that the speaker ascribes to the [...] "mutual render” he and his beloved share - [...] "only me for thee".|$|E
