500|$|The {{bad feeling}} about the {{proceeds}} from the Lord's Test lingered and, {{at the end of}} their tour, the Fourth Australians faced more recriminations from the British press. Among other things, they were accused of [...] "introducing a bloodthirsty spirit" [...] and [...] "playing too obviously for money's sake". This criticism was countered by The Australasian of 11 October, whose cricket writer Tom Horan, though himself no supporter of Murdoch's team, objected to the [...] "spiteful criticism from certain portions of the English press" [...] and pointed out the [...] "narrow-minded and insulting abuse levelled at the Australian cricketers". However, in his history of Lord's, Warner stated that the Australians had [...] "evidently come into favour" [...] and that [...] "the rows and bickerings of the past were happily <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>done</b> with".|$|E
500|$|Many {{critics have}} {{emphasised}} {{the importance of}} the religious themes in the poem. Vincent Bucklet stated that the Four Quartets [...] "presuppose certain values as necessary for their very structure as poems yet devote that structure to questioning their meaning and relevance. The whole work is, in fact, the most authentic example I know in modern poetry of a satisfying religio-poetic meditation. We sense throughout it is not merely a building-up of an intricate poetic form on the foundation of experiences already <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>done</b> with, but a constant energy, an ever-present activity, of thinking and feeling." [...] In his analysis of approaches regarding apocalypse and religious in British poetry, M H Abrams claimed, [...] "Even after a quarter-century, T. S. Eliot's Four Quartets has not lost its status as a strikingly 'modern' poem; its evolving meditations, however, merely play complex variations upon the design and motifs of Romantic representation of the poets educational progress." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the course}} of {{conducting}} his interviews, Murakami observed that [...] "most Japanese seem ready to pack up the whole incident in a trunk labeled THINGS <b>OVER</b> <b>AND</b> <b>DONE</b> WITH," [...] but this mentality prevents them from learning from the event. In particular, Murakami criticizes the Japanese crisis management system as being [...] "erratic and sorely inadequate." [...] He further worries that the government's lack of openness about its failings {{may lead to the}} repetition of past mistakes. Murakami also discusses one factor that led to the attacks [...] the handing over of personal responsibility by cult members to Aum leader Shoko Asahara [...] however, he notes that perhaps everyone, himself included, does this to an extent, accepting someone else's [...] "narrative" [...] rather than take the responsibility of creating their own.|$|E

2500|$|Filmed {{about four}} {{years after the end of}} World War II (1939–1945), Wagon Master {{treatment}} of violence was unusual, especially for a Western. In the film, the Mormons are pacifists and unarmed; this was Ford's story choice, as 19th century Mormons often took up arms. The Mormon wagon train of the film is thus vulnerable to armed threats, which include its encounters with the band of Navajo, who prove to be peaceable, and with the Clegg family, who are certainly not. Travis and Sandy are armed, but Sandy has apparently never fired a weapon at a person, and Travis claims that he's only shot [...] "snakes". They are nonetheless able to defeat the Cleggs in a brief gunbattle precipitated by the Cleggs' murder of one of the unarmed Mormon men. Glenn Erickson writes, [...] "Travis says he only draws on snakes, not people, and when he's forced to fight he throws his gun away afterward. That's also a feeling I felt from the men in my family, all ex-soldiers. The war was <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>done</b> with; as far as they were concerned victory and peace would last forever." [...] Shigehiko Hasumi notes that Ford's films often show the throwing of objects at significant moments.|$|E
