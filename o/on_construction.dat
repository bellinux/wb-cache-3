Virtually the entire American battle line was being designed from pre-dreadnought experience and observation of foreign designs.

5|$|Even {{five years}} before Texas was complete, the blast effects from end-on fire were {{considered}} prohibitive and en echelon mounting of main guns was abandoned in European navies.

Construction by this time was too far advanced for such a plan, however, and Navy Secretary Benjamin Tracy limited the Board to detail improvements.|$|E

5|$|In {{an effort}} to improve air quality, the city placed {{restrictions}} <b>on</b> <b>construction</b> sites and gas stations, and limited the use of commercial and passenger vehicles in Beijing. From 20 June through 20 September, passenger vehicle restrictions were placed on alternate days depending on the terminal digit of the car's license plate. It was anticipated that this measure would take 45% of Beijing's 3.3million cars off the streets. The boosted public transport network was expected to absorb the demand created by these restrictions and the influx of visitors, which was estimated at more than 4million additional passengers per day.|$|E

5|$|More recent {{research}} suggests that that fortification actually commanded the harbour adequately. No single site would have been completely effective due to the rugged coastline, and that Harry's Walls may {{have been designed to}} work in concert with another fort. Furthermore, the fort would have fitted easily into its proposed location and have been easy to defend, due to the surrounding water and marshland. Instead, the high costs of England's wider fortification programme - Edward's government spent an unsustainable £35,228 <b>on</b> <b>construction</b> work during the five years of his reign - are blamed for making its completion unviable, particularly once the French invasion threat had passed.|$|E
5|$|Norris had {{similarly}} scouted {{settings for}} his novel and chose the upstairs {{of a building}} {{on the corner of}} Polk and California street as McTeague's dentist office, as well as many of the saloons and lunch counters in the area. Stroheim discovered that many of the locations that Norris had described, such as Polk Street, had been destroyed in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, but he was able to find suitable period locations on Hayes and Laguna streets. For authenticity, Stroheim had no sets built in San Francisco and only redecorated existing locations, such as saloons, butcher shops, and wooden shacks, thus saving <b>on</b> <b>construction</b> costs.|$|E
