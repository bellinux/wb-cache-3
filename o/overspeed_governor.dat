40|$|Tall {{buildings}} {{are susceptible to}} large sway motions when subjected to earthquake excitations. They are particularly affected by long period earthquake ground motions. These low frequency seismic waves resonate with the fundamental mode of the building structure which in turn causes resonance interactions with long slender continua such as lift suspension ropes, compensating ropes and <b>overspeed</b> <b>governor</b> ropes deployed in modular lift installations. Damage due to large resonance motions of suspension/ compensating ropes and cables during earthquake {{are one of the}} most common modes of failure in high-rise lift installations. In this paper an analytical model to predict the dynamic responses of suspension/ compensating/ governor rope system installed in tall buildings under seismic conditions is presented. The model is then used to predict the dynamic performance of the system under long period earthquake excitations. The predictions can then be used to develop suitable mitigating strategies and protective measures to minimize the earthquake damage...|$|E

50|$|Elmer E. Woodward conceived, {{designed}} and developed {{the first successful}} propeller control in 1933. This model PW-34 propeller governor is {{on display at the}} Udvar-Hazy annex of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum. Today, approximately 75% of all propeller-driven aircraft use Woodward AES controls. A growing number of general aviation and commuter aircraft rely on Woodward AES <b>overspeed</b> <b>governors,</b> synchronizers and synchophasers for the turboshaft, turboprops and reciprocating engines. As engine controls have moved toward electric-based systems, Woodward has responded with a line of electric propeller controls. The engines that are controlled by Woodward Aircraft engines systems are from Honeywell (TPE331), General Electric (CT7), Pratt & Whitney Canada (PT6A series), Raytheon, Vans, and Rotax Corporations to name a few.

40|$|LecturePg. 123 - 130 Several {{aspects of}} {{maintaining}} and operating small steam turbines at the A von Refinery are discussed. The discussion concentrates on {{areas that have}} historically resulted in unreliable performance and repetitive failures. The scope of this discussion is limited to general purpose steam turbines {{as defined by the}} American Petroleum Institute in API 611 General Purpose Steam Turbines For Refinery Service; i. e., steam turbines with inlet conditions not exceeding 600 psi at 750 ?F with speeds below 6000 rpm and horsepowers below 2500. The intent herein is to focus on critical areas of turbine design and share with the reader the methods used at the Avon Refinery to successfully improve the integrity and reliability of turbines in those areas. Areas discussed will be bearing failures, coupling failures, <b>governors,</b> <b>overspeed,</b> and performance monitoring...|$|R
