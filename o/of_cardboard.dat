40|$|In {{a recent}} study, an {{environment-friendly}} material, corrugated cardboard, {{was used as}} a building block for the vibration isolator with a preliminary study. The present thesis was motivated to advance technology for improving the design of such a corrugated cardboard vibration isolator with a focus on the modeling of its stiffness and damping. In particular, this study has performed the following works: (1) improving the FE (finite element) model of the stiffness <b>of</b> the corrugated <b>cardboards</b> by more accurately identifying the material parameters in the cardboard material constitutive equation; (2) analyzing the effect of the error in geometry <b>of</b> the corrugated <b>cardboards</b> in the FE model; (3) developing the Rayleigh damping model <b>of</b> the corrugated <b>cardboards</b> and evaluating its accuracy. Several conclusions were drawn from this study: (1) the parameter identification procedure based on the inverse analysis is feasible for improving the accuracy of the model of the stiffness <b>of</b> the <b>cardboard.</b> (2) The FE model <b>of</b> the <b>cardboards</b> with a greater in-plane geometrical deflection has less vertical compressive stiffness. The geometrical deflections <b>of</b> the corrugated <b>cardboards</b> also change the condition of the contact friction stress and the compressive deformation. (3) Rayleigh damping model is accurate enough for calculating the damping <b>of</b> the corrugated <b>cardboards.</b> The contributions <b>of</b> the thesis include: (1) provision of a more accurate model for the compressive stiffness the corrugated cardboards, (2) finding that the friction between the cardboard and the vibrator and the geometrical error <b>of</b> the <b>cardboards</b> have a significant influence over the accuracy of the FE model, (3) finding that in practice the foregoing influence can significantly degraded the performance <b>of</b> the <b>cardboards</b> as a vibrator isolator, and (4) provision of a model for the compressive damping <b>of</b> the corrugated <b>cardboards...</b>|$|R
5|$|Han Sai Por {{was born}} on 19 July 1943 in Singapore during the Japanese occupation. She was one of six {{children}} of a poor couple, and her family were squatters living in Changi in a house made <b>of</b> <b>cardboard</b> boxes and coconut leaves. Nonetheless, Han had a happy childhood, {{and went to a}} nearby beach to make figurine animals out of sand. This experience helped her to appreciate nature and instilled in her a sense of adventure and exploration. At ten years of age, Han was introduced to Michelangelo's sculptures through a book given to her by her mother.|$|E
5|$|A film studio set {{was created}} by photographing several reel spools with strips of film {{dangling}} {{against a background of}} blinking lights. The casting office {{was created by}} silhouetting strips <b>of</b> <b>cardboard</b> against a white background. To portray the mental anguish of the protagonist, strips of paper were cut into the shape of twisted trees, which were silhouetted against a background of moving shadows and set in motion with an electric fan. To create a scene {{near the end of the}} film, when the protagonist starts becoming delirious, the camera moves through a maze of different sized cubes, with geometric designs inside them, all placed on a flat, shiny service. The heaven setting was also a miniature set created from paper cubes, tin cans, cigar boxes, toy trains, and a motorized Erector Set. No still photos were taken for the film, but illustrations showing prism and kaleidoscope effects have been made by enlarging frames of negative. The paper prints were considerably softer than the movie print in order to avoid graininess. The final film was edited to a one-reel length of 1,200 feet of film strip, featuring about 150 scenes. Florey said it featured the same number of angles as full-length feature films of the time. Although the film was carefully edited to be synchronized with Rhapsody in Blue, much of the original lyrical quality has been lost in shortened and modified versions of the film.|$|E
5|$|Cropping {{systems can}} be {{modified}} to favor natural enemies, a practice {{sometimes referred to as}} habitat manipulation. Providing a suitable habitat, such as a shelterbelt, hedgerow, or beetle bank where beneficial insects such as parasitoidal wasps can live and reproduce, can help ensure the survival of populations of natural enemies. Things as simple as leaving a layer of fallen leaves or mulch in place provides a suitable food source for worms and provides a shelter for insects, in turn being a food source for such beneficial mammals as hedgehogs and shrews. Compost piles and stacks of wood can provide shelter for invertebrates and small mammals. Long grass and ponds support amphibians. Not removing dead annuals and non-hardy plants in the autumn allows insects to make use of their hollow stems during winter. In California, prune trees are sometimes planted in grape vineyards to provide an improved overwintering habitat or refuge for a key grape pest parasitoid. The providing of artificial shelters in the form of wooden caskets, boxes or flowerpots is also sometimes undertaken, particularly in gardens, to make a cropped area more attractive to natural enemies. For example, earwigs are natural predators which can be encouraged in gardens by hanging upside-down flowerpots filled with straw or wood wool. Green lacewings can be encouraged by using plastic bottles with an open bottom and a roll <b>of</b> <b>cardboard</b> inside. Birdhouses enable insectivorous birds to nest; the most useful birds can be attracted by choosing an opening just large enough for the desired species.|$|E

5|$|The episodes took {{seventeen}} days to film, where normally crew {{are given}} eight days to film a week's worth of episodes. Between forty and forty-five members of crew were required for filming the fire episode, including assistant directors, a design department, cameras, lighting, sound, make up, costume, visual effects, fire safety officers and a stunt team {{consisting of a}} stunt co-ordinator and stunt doubles. Filming was done with four television cameras, a steadicam and a dolly. The exterior fire scenes were filmed first, in five night shoots lasting until 4a.m., and the real exterior set was burnt. Safety was the top priority for the fire scenes, and fire safety advisors ensured all cast and crew were protected. Stunt doubles wore flame-proof gel on their faces and for the scene where Ryan and Stacey fall from the ladder, several layers <b>of</b> <b>cardboard</b> boxes were stacked {{on the ground for}} the stunt doubles to fall onto. For filming the final explosion scene, all the actors whose characters were involved were filmed separately for their reactions. The explosion had to be delayed due to a power failure at Elstree Studios, two minutes before the explosion was due to be set off, which also affected a live broadcast of Big Brother. The power cut lasted two hours and filming was further delayed due to rain. The explosion was completed in a third take. Despite the delay, the scenes were completed on schedule. Salisbury noted that the demise of such an iconic set as The Queen Victoria left several cast members in tears.|$|E
5|$|The safest way to {{view the}} Sun's disk is by {{indirect}} projection. This {{can be done by}} projecting an image of the disk onto a white piece of paper or card using a pair of binoculars (with one of the lenses covered), a telescope, or another piece <b>of</b> <b>cardboard</b> with a small hole in it (about 1mm diameter), often called a pinhole camera. The projected image of the Sun can then be safely viewed; this technique can be used to observe sunspots, as well as eclipses. Care must be taken, however, to ensure that no one looks through the projector (telescope, pinhole, etc.) directly. Viewing the Sun's disk on a video display screen (provided by a video camera or digital camera) is safe, although the camera itself may be damaged by direct exposure to the Sun. The optical viewfinders provided with some video and digital cameras are not safe. Securely mounting #14 welder's glass in front of the lens and viewfinder protects the equipment and makes viewing possible. Professional workmanship is essential because of the dire consequences any gaps or detaching mountings will have. In the partial eclipse path, one {{will not be able to}} see the corona or nearly complete darkening of the sky, however, depending on how much of the Sun's disk is obscured, some darkening may be noticeable. If three-quarters or more of the sun is obscured, then an effect can be observed by which the daylight appears to be dim, as if the sky were overcast, yet objects still cast sharp shadows.|$|E

25|$|Scenes of the Emergency Escape Vehicle {{were shot}} with a 3.5-foot {{miniature}} against a blue-screen and composited onto large scale traditional matte paintings of the planet's surface. To make the clouds glow from within as the EEV entered the atmosphere, the painting's values were digitally reversed and animated frame-by-frame. The scene in which the EEV is moved by a crane-arm (also a miniature) was created by projecting a video of actors onto pieces <b>of</b> <b>cardboard</b> and then compositing them into the scene as silhouettes against the matte painted background.|$|E

40|$|The {{corrugated}} cardboard {{is widely used}} in manufacturing industries as a packaging and transportation material. Faculty <b>of</b> corrugated <b>cardboard</b> is depended on the fragility, weight, thickness, toughness and so on. The strength <b>of</b> corrugated <b>cardboard</b> changed with the fabrication process, used atmosphere and variety of loading patterns. On the machining process <b>of</b> corrugated <b>cardboard</b> box, the cutting and ruling technology is very important factor. The effects of these factors on the strength <b>of</b> corrugated <b>cardboard</b> have not yet enough been identified. In general, the {{corrugated cardboard}} was composed with three layer of paperboard. One is outside liner and inside liner {{and the other is}} corrugated medium. The top of corrugated medium is bonded with glue on outside or inside layer surface. The bonded space was decided by company standard. The evolutional method of bonding strength had not been established. The development of new simple method has been needed. In this research, to establish the evaluation method of strength <b>of</b> corrugated <b>cardboard</b> material, new practical tensile test and shear test, considering the glue bonding strength, was proposed and the factory of these test method was investigated. In current studies, it was too hard to evaluate the reproductive tensile and shear strength <b>of</b> corrugated <b>cardboard,</b> because <b>of</b> fabrication method of the cut specimen and the deformation of chuck position. On the shear test, as the direction of parallel chuck changed during loading process, the specimen was rotated. In this research, the new developed method of tensile and shear was accomplished, the reproduced strength could be obtained. The fatigue test was tried on the shear test to investigate the effect of thickness of specimen...|$|R
25|$|The most {{brilliant}} analysis ever {{done on a}} structural puzzle was surely the solution (1953) of the terramycin problem. It was a problem of great industrial importance, and hence many able chemists had performed {{an enormous amount of}} work trying to determine the structure. There seemed to be too much data to resolve the problem, because a significant number of observations, although experimentally correct, were very misleading. Woodward took a large piece <b>of</b> <b>cardboard,</b> wrote on it all the facts and, by thought alone, deduced the correct structure for terramycin. Nobody else could have done that at the time.|$|E
