5|$|The drama program begins {{engaging}} {{students in}} acting and dramatic writing, directing, and the technical {{arts in the}} fourth group. Students practice both rehearsed and improvised performances to create pantomimes, monologues, films, and short plays. Their theatrical work culminates in the eighth group {{with the performance of}} one-act plays the students write and direct themselves and the production of a professionally scripted full-length play. Artistically inclined students can extend their arts studies <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>class</b> in optional activities including Art Club, Chorus, Orchestra, Tech Club, Drama Club, and the Variety Show.|$|E
5|$|Hoping {{to become}} a teacher, Soeman tried out for a course for {{potential}} teachers in Medan, North Sumatra, soon after graduation. After he was accepted, he spent two years studying in that city. Among his teachers was , whose later short story collection Teman Doedoek (1937) became the first such work in the Indonesian literary canon. <b>Outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>class,</b> Soeman would listen to Kasim's stories about authors and the creative writing process; this sparked his interest in becoming a writer. After two years in Medan, Soeman continued to a normal school in Langsa, Aceh, where he stayed until 1923. There he met his future wife, Siti Hasnah.|$|E
5|$|The senior project {{consists}} of four main P's project, paper, portfolio and presentation. The {{students are required to}} work on a project <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>class</b> that takes at least 15 hours of their time. This project can be anything. Their paper then has to relate in some way to their project, so if the project is creating a bird house the paper could be able the best type of bird house. The portfolio then brings everything together with evidence to prove that the project was completed. The presentation is then given at least 3 times and ties all of the items together. All the projects are judged throughout the year, and the top four receive a scholarship to help finance their college education.|$|E

She was selected to be a North Carolina Fellow, a four-year leadership development program, and posthumously received the Chancellor's award for most outstanding woman in the senior class and the General Alumni Association's Distinguished Young Alumnus award.|$|E
25|$|Professors {{seem to be}} able {{to punish}} {{students}} with relative impunity and can hand out detention, even for unsatisfactory grades. Enforcement of rules <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>class</b> mainly falls to the caretaker, with the assistance of the prefects. A student's Head of House usually has the final say in disciplinary matters. However, during Umbridge's tenure at Hogwarts, she quickly obtains the power to have the final say in disciplinary actions, due to an Educational Decree (one of many) passed by Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge.|$|E
25|$|While at Harvard Kittredge {{also joined}} several clubs and societies, wrote light verse, and won {{numerous}} consecutive Bowdoin prizes for his essays and translations, including one from English into Attic Greek. He {{also became a}} member of the editorial board of the Harvard Advocate. In 1881 Kittredge was the prompter and pronunciation coach in a celebrated theatrical performance by undergraduates of Sophocles's Oedipus Rex in the original Greek that was attended by Ralph Waldo Emerson, Julia Ward Howe, William Dean Howells, Charles Eliot Norton, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and classicist B. L. Gildersleeve of Johns Hopkins University among other luminaries. As an undergraduate, Kittredge also read widely <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>class,</b> and became known as a witty after dinner speaker. In 1882, he was elected Ivy Orator (chosen to deliver a humorous speech) of his graduating class. Graduating with Kittredge that year was Owen Wister, author of the first Western novel, The Virginian.|$|E
50|$|The MBCT {{program is}} a group {{intervention}} that lasts eight weeks. During these eight weeks, there is a weekly course, which lasts two hours, and one day-long class after the fifth week. However, much of the practice is done <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>classes,</b> where the participant uses guided meditations and attempts to cultivate mindfulness in their daily lives.|$|R
50|$|A {{convergent}} pattern-search {{method was}} proposed by Yu, who proved that it converged using {{the theory of}} positive bases. Later, Torczon, Lagarias, and co-authors used positive-basis techniques to prove the convergence of another pattern-search method on a specific <b>class</b> <b>of</b> functions. <b>Outside</b> <b>of</b> such <b>classes,</b> pattern search is a heuristic that can provide useful approximate solutions for some issues, but can fail on others. <b>Outside</b> <b>of</b> such <b>classes,</b> pattern search is not an iterative method that converges to a solution; indeed, pattern-search methods can converge to non-stationary points on some relatively tame problems.|$|R

The method {{does not have to}} be known at compile time, the understanding being that the required functionality may be available or may not, based on the user's preferences.|$|R
500|$|She would {{describe}} her time at Princeton as a life-changing experience. Initially, {{she felt like}} [...] "a visitor landing in an alien country" [...] as her exposure had been limited to the Bronx and Puerto Rico. Princeton had few women students and fewer Latinos (about 20). She was too intimidated to ask questions during her freshman year; her writing and vocabulary skills were weak, and she lacked knowledge in the classics. She put in long hours in the library and over summers, worked with a professor <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>class,</b> and gained skills, knowledge, and confidence. She became a moderate student activist and co-chair of the Acción Puertorriqueña organization, which served as a social and political hub and sought more opportunities for Puerto Rican students. She worked in the admissions office, traveling to high schools and lobbying on behalf of her best prospects.|$|E
500|$|Richards {{was born}} on August 19, 1925 in New York City to George H. Richards and Marianna Middlebrook Richards. Both parents were from old New England {{families}} who had settled in Fairfield and New London, Connecticut in the 1600s. [...] The family usually spent summers in Connecticut, giving Richards an early affinity for the area which continued through his career at Yale University. He had two older sisters, Marianna and Sarah. Marianna became a biochemist, and was a significant role model for Fred, who delighted in the smells and explosions produced by chemistry sets in that era. He attended high school at Phillips Exeter Academy, and later recalled that [...] "the excellent science department even permitted certain students the unsupervised run of the laboratories <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>class</b> hours. This attitude played a strong role... in cementing our commitment to scientific careers." [...] He learned glassblowing and electronics there, and tried to measure the universal gravitational constant using 100-pound cannonballs.|$|E
500|$|The many famous {{students}} {{educated at}} the abbey included the noted abbess and princess Louise Adélaïde de Bourbon, and Louise d'Esparbès de Lussan, {{the mistress of}} the Count of Artois, the future Charles X of France. Thomas Jefferson's daughters Martha and Mary were both educated at the Pentemont Abbey while he was Minister to France. [...] Their entry into the school {{was sponsored by the}} wife of the Marquis de Lafayette. [...] The future first lady Abigail Adams was shocked that Jefferson would send his girls to a Catholic school but he assured her that there were many Protestants at the abbey. [...] Conditions were austere for the students, despite the presence of three princesses, with no fires until the water froze and a prohibition on speaking <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>class</b> and recreation. [...] Her time at the school led Martha, nicknamed Patsy, to write a letter to her father expressing her desire to become a nun. [...] Jefferson quickly removed his daughters from the care of the convent.|$|E
5000|$|Students {{can follow}} their own {{pathways}} of learning. The school {{uses the term}} [...] "self directed learning" [...] to distinguish between learning taking place in a class and learning driven or directed by the student <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> a classroom setting. Often called inquiry learning, this means that students can opt to work <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>classes</b> and courses on their own passions and interests, drawing on resources and experts as needed. In practice {{the amount of time}} given over to this individual, and often independent, style of learning varies according to the interests and maturity of each student.|$|R

500|$|On {{researching the}} history of UCL's Egyptology department, the {{historian}} Rosalind M. Janssen stated that Murray was [...] "remembered with gratitude and immense affection by all her former students. A wise and witty teacher, two generations of Egyptologists have forever been in her debt." [...] Alongside teaching them, Murray was known to socialise with her UCL students <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>class</b> hours. The archaeologist Ralph Merrifield, who knew Murray through the Folklore Society, described her as a [...] "diminutive and kindly scholar, who radiated intelligence and strength of character into extreme old age". Davidson, who also knew Murray through the Society, noted that at their meetings [...] "she would sit near the front, a bent and seemingly guileless old lady dozing peacefully, {{and then in the}} middle of a discussion would suddenly intervene with a relevant and penetrating comment which showed that she had missed not one word of the argument". The later folklorist Juliette Wood noted that many members of the Folklore Society [...] "remember her fondly", adding that Murray had been [...] "especially keen to encourage younger researchers, even those who disagreed with her ideas".|$|E
2500|$|From {{within the}} Glee Club, the Statesmen {{are a small}} a cappella {{ensemble}} that are auditioned separately {{from the rest of}} the Glee Club. [...] Their repertoire usually consists of moderate to difficult modern tunes or songs with a generally [...] "lighter" [...] tone compared to the more classical repertoire of the Glee Club. The Statesmen consists of 16 to 20 singers, and in addition to participating in all Glee Club rehearsals, they also hold their own rehearsals <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>class</b> for 2 to 3 hours per week.|$|E
2500|$|Gifted {{students}} are {{pulled out of}} a heterogeneous classroom to spend {{a portion of their}} time in a gifted class. These programs vary widely, from carefully designed half-day academic programs to a single hour each week of educational challenges. Generally, these programs are ineffective at promoting academic advancement unless the material covered contains extensions and enrichment to the core curriculum. [...] The majority of pull-out programs include an assortment of critical thinking drills, creative exercises, and subjects typically not introduced in standard curricula. Much of the material introduced in Gifted pull-out programs deals with the study of Logic, and its application to fields ranging from Philosophy to Mathematics. Students are encouraged to apply these empirical reasoning skills to every aspect of their education both in and <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>class.</b> In some elementary classes such as math, students divide classes based on level: highest (gifted), median and lowest.|$|E
