25|$|Lee enjoyed basic medical studies after {{entering}} the medical department. He finished his first research paper in his freshman year, {{which was published}} in the Taiwanese Medical Magazine (台灣醫學雜誌). After graduating in 1940, Lee decided to quit clinical medicine and keep on studying. He became the assistant of Tsungming Tu, who was researching on basic medical studies and, at the time, the only Taiwanese professors in the medical department. He <b>once</b> <b>said,</b> <b>To</b> gain honor for Taiwan, dignity for the Taiwanese, I chose to follow Professor Tu instead of several other Japanese professors. Because I thought Professor Tu was our people, and we should help him.|$|E

500|$|In 1991, Dylan {{received}} a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award from American actor Jack Nicholson. The event {{coincided with the}} start of the Gulf War against Saddam Hussein, and Dylan performed [...] "Masters of War". Dylan then made a short speech, saying [...] "My daddy <b>once</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> me, he said, 'Son, it is possible for you to become so defiled in this world that your own mother and father will abandon you. If that happens, God will believe in your ability to mend your own ways.'" [...] This sentiment was subsequently revealed to be a quote from 19th-century German Jewish intellectual, Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch.|$|E
500|$|Harper {{described}} {{the extent to}} which Duvall inhabited his character: [...] "Someone <b>once</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> me, 'Well, how's Robert Duvall?' and I said, 'I don't know Robert Duvall. I know Mac Sledge very well. Beresford, too, said the transformation was so believable that he could feel his skin crawling up {{the back of his neck}} the first day of filming. Duvall made an effort to help Harper, who was making her film debut. While preparing to shoot a scene in which Mac and Rosa Lee fight, he yelled at a make-up artist in front of Harper to make her angry and fuel her performance; he apologized to the make-up artist after the scene was shot.|$|E
500|$|Island Records was keen on Drake {{promoting}} Bryter Layter through press interviews, radio {{sessions and}} live appearances. Drake, who {{by this time}} was smoking what Kirby has described as [...] "unbelievable amounts" [...] of cannabis and exhibiting [...] "the first signs of psychosis", refused. Disappointed by the reaction to Bryter Layter, he turned his thoughts inwards, and withdrew from family and friends. He rarely left his flat, and then only to play an occasional concert or to buy drugs. His sister recalled: [...] "This was a very bad time. He <b>once</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> me that everything started to go wrong from [...] time on, and I think that was when things started to go wrong." ...|$|E

500|$|... 'Judas' is {{a metaphor}} and an analogy about {{forgiveness}} and betrayal and things that haunt you {{in your life and}} how I believe that it's the darkness in your life that ultimately shines and illuminates the greater light that you have upon you. Someone <b>once</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> me, 'If you have no shadows then you're not standing in the light.' So the song is about washing the feet of both good and evil and understanding and forgiving the demons from your past in order to move into the greatness of your future. I just like really aggressive metaphors—harder, thicker, darker—and my fans do as well. So it is a very challenging and aggressive metaphor, but it {{is a metaphor}}.|$|E
500|$|Davies and Cornell {{debated whether}} {{it should have been}} Rose's plan all along to save her father; this is left {{ambiguous}} in the episode. Billie Piper felt that it did not occur to Rose until after she began travelling. In the original script, in the scene where the Doctor opens the TARDIS doors and discovers only a police box interior, the police box fell apart. This was changed for reasons of cost, and Cornell has stated that he thinks the change is an improvement. Cornell also states that the character of Pete Tyler is based on his own father, who attempted many different jobs and schemes (including, like Pete, selling health drinks) before eventually finding success running a betting shop. Pete's line [...] "I'm your dad, it's my job for it to be my fault" [...] is taken from something Cornell's father <b>once</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> him. Originally Pete was to take a swig of wine before sacrificing himself, but this was removed because a correlation between alcohol and bravery was not thought to be a positive message.|$|E
500|$|In July 2011, Lindelof {{said that}} the film would rely upon {{practical}} effects, and would use CGI generally for on-set pre-visualization of external space visuals. Scott said that [...] "you can pretty much do anything you want" [...] with digital technology, and, [...] "Doug Trumbull <b>once</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> me 'If {{you can do it}} live, do it live.' That was 29 years ago. Even though we have remarkable digital capabilities I still say do it live. It's cheaper." [...] Cinematographer Dariusz Wolski convinced Scott that {{it would be possible to}} film in 3D with the same ease and efficiency of 2D filming. 3D company 3ality Technica provided some of the rigs and equipment to facilitate 3D filming, and trained the film's crew in their proper operation. According to Scott, the decision to film in 3D added $10 million to the film's budget. Since 3D films need high lighting levels on set, the hallmark dark and shadowy atmosphere of the Alien films was added in post-production using color grading processes, and the 3D equipment was based on post-Avatar technology.|$|E
