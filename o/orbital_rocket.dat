25|$|SpaceX's {{achievements}} {{include the}} first privately funded liquid-propellant rocket to reach orbit (Falcon 1 in 2008); the first privately funded company to successfully launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft (Dragon in 2010); the first private company {{to send a}} spacecraft to the International Space Station (Dragon in 2012); the first propulsive landing for an <b>orbital</b> <b>rocket</b> (Falcon 9 in 2015); and the first reuse of an <b>orbital</b> <b>rocket</b> (Falcon 9 in 2017). , SpaceX has since flown ten missions to the International Space Station (ISS) under a cargo resupply contract. NASA also awarded SpaceX a further development contract in 2011 to develop and demonstrate a human-rated Dragon, which {{would be used to}} transport astronauts to the ISS and return them safely to Earth.|$|E
25|$|SpaceX {{announced}} in 2011 {{that they were}} beginning a privately funded reusable launch system technology development program. In December 2015, a first stage was flown back to a landing pad near the launch site, where it successfully accomplished a propulsive vertical landing. This was the first such achievement by a rocket for orbital spaceflight. In April 2016, with the launch of CRS-8, SpaceX successfully vertically landed a first stage on an ocean drone-ship landing platform. In May 2016, in another first, SpaceX again landed a first stage, but during a significantly more energetic geostationary transfer orbit mission. In March 2017, SpaceX became the first to successfully re-launch and land {{the first stage of}} an <b>orbital</b> <b>rocket.</b>|$|E

25|$|On {{the flight}} home, Musk {{realized}} that he could start a company that could build the affordable rockets he needed. According to early Tesla and SpaceX investor Steve Jurvetson, Musk calculated that the raw materials for building a rocket actually were only 3 percent of the sales price of a rocket at the time. By applying vertical integration, producing around 85% of launch hardware in-house, and the modular approach from software engineering, SpaceX could cut launch price {{by a factor of}} ten and still enjoy a 70 percent gross margin. SpaceX started with the smallest useful <b>orbital</b> <b>rocket,</b> instead of building a more complex and riskier launch vehicle, which could have failed and bankrupted the company.|$|E

25|$|It {{is worth}} noting that <b>orbital</b> <b>rockets</b> are {{launched}} vertically at first to lift the rocket above the atmosphere (which causes frictional drag), and then slowly pitch over and finish firing the rocket engine parallel to the atmosphere to achieve orbit speed.|$|R
2500|$|Richardson {{formed a}} foundation, the Richardson Center, to help {{negotiate}} {{the release of}} political prisoners globally. In January 2013, he led a delegation of business leaders, including Google chairman Eric Schmidt, shortly after the state had launched an <b>orbital</b> <b>rocket.</b> Richardson called the trip a [...] "private, humanitarian" [...] mission by U.S. citizens and told the Associated Press he would speak to North Korean officials about the detention of Kenneth Bae, a U.S. citizen accused of committing [...] "hostile" [...] acts against the state, and seek to visit the American.|$|E
2500|$|SpaceX {{continues}} {{to carry out}} first stage landings on every orbital launch that fuel margins allow. By October 2016, following the successful landings, SpaceX indicated they were offering their customers a ten percent price discount {{if they choose to}} fly their payload on a reused Falcon 9 first stage. On March 30, 2017, SpaceX launched a [...] "flight-proven" [...] Falcon 9 for the SES-10 mission. This was the first time a re-launch of a payload-carrying <b>orbital</b> <b>rocket</b> went back to space. The first stage was recovered and landed on the ASDS Of Course I Still Love You in the Atlantic Ocean, also making it the first landing of a reused orbital class rocket. Elon Musk called the achievement an [...] "incredible milestone in the history of space." ...|$|E

50|$|On {{a planet}} with an atmosphere, the {{objective}} is further complicated {{by the need to}} achieve the necessary altitude to escape the atmosphere, and to minimize the losses due to atmospheric drag during the launch itself.

25|$|Thus far, the {{required}} velocity (delta-v) to achieve orbit has been unattainable by any single rocket because the propellant, tankage, structure, guidance, valves and engines and so on, take a particular minimum percentage of take-off mass {{that is too}} great for the propellant it carries to achieve that delta-v. Since Single-stage-to-orbit has {{so far not been}} achievable, <b>orbital</b> <b>rockets</b> always have more than one stage.|$|R
