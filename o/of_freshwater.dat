5|$|Seasonal {{rainfall}} {{patterns of}} the Western Ghats necessitate a period of dormancy for its land snails, resulting in their high abundance and diversity including at least 258 species of gastropods from 57 genera and 24 families. A total of 77 species <b>of</b> <b>freshwater</b> molluscs (52 gastropods and 25 bivalves) have been recorded from the Western Ghats, but the actual number is likely higher. This include 28 endemics. Among the threatened freshwater molluscs are the mussels Pseudomulleria dalyi, which is a Gondwanan relict, and the snail Cremnoconchus, which is restricted to the spray zone of waterfalls. According to the IUCN, 4 species <b>of</b> <b>freshwater</b> molluscs are considered endangered and 3 are vulnerable. An additional 19 species are considered data deficient.|$|E
50|$|In June 2009, John and Nancy Freshwater filed Freshwater v.

The suit wanted Freshwater reinstated as a science teacher at the school.

5|$|No {{consensus}} {{has been}} reached on the exact depositional nature of the Irati oil shale.

Other theory suggests that the organic sediment may have been deposited in a shallow, partially restricted marine environment. Hutton's classification describes it as a marine source oil shale.|$|E

5|$|The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) {{divides the}} waters of the Columbia and its tributaries into three {{freshwater}} ecoregions, naming them Columbia Glaciated, Columbia Unglaciated, and Upper Snake. The Columbia Glaciated ecoregion, making up {{about a third of the}} total watershed, lies in the north and was covered with ice sheets during the Pleistocene. The ecoregion includes the mainstem Columbia north of the Snake River and tributaries such as the Yakima, Okanagan, Pend Oreille, Clark Fork, and Kootenay rivers. The effects of glaciation include a number of large lakes and a relatively low diversity <b>of</b> <b>freshwater</b> fish. The Upper Snake ecoregion is defined as the Snake River watershed above Shoshone Falls, which totally blocks fish migration. This region has 14species of fish, many of which are endemic. The Columbia Unglaciated ecoregion makes up the rest of the watershed. It includes the mainstem Columbia below the Snake River and tributaries such as the Salmon, John Day, Deschutes, and lower Snake Rivers. Of the three ecoregions it is the richest in terms <b>of</b> <b>freshwater</b> species diversity. There are 35species of fish, of which four are endemic. There are also high levels of mollusk endemism.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} climate change on teleosts could be {{powerful}} but are complex. For example, increased winter precipitation (rain and snow) could harm populations <b>of</b> <b>freshwater</b> fish in Norway, whereas warmer summers could increase growth of adult fish. In the oceans, teleosts may be able to cope with warming, as it is simply an extension of natural variation in climate. It is uncertain how ocean acidification, caused by rising carbon dioxide levels, might affect teleosts.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} {{exception to}} the above are the fossil-bearing beds of Old Red Sandstones found principally along the Moray Firth coast. The Highlands are generally mountainous and the highest elevations in the British Isles are found here. Scotland has over 790 islands divided into four main groups: Shetland, Orkney, and the Inner Hebrides and Outer Hebrides. There are numerous bodies <b>of</b> <b>freshwater</b> including Loch Lomond and Loch Ness. Some parts of the coastline consist of machair, a low lying dune pasture land.|$|E
