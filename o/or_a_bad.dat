25|$|It was {{not until}} he was {{approaching}} 50 that Rameau decided to embark on the operatic career on which his fame as a composer mainly rests. He had already approached writer Houdar de la Motte for a libretto in 1727, but nothing came of it; he was finally inspired to try his hand at the prestigious genre of tragédie en musique after seeing Montéclair's Jephté in 1732. Rameau's Hippolyte et Aricie premiered at the Académie Royale de Musique on 1 October 1733. It was immediately recognised as the most significant opera to appear in France {{since the death of}} Lully, but audiences were split over whether this was a good thing <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> thing. Some, such as the composer André Campra, were stunned by its originality and wealth of invention; others found its harmonic innovations discordant and saw the work as an attack on the French musical tradition. The two camps, the so-called Lullyistes and the Rameauneurs, fought a pamphlet war over the issue {{for the rest of the}} decade.|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to a reviewer's criticism of Bond as villainous, Fleming said in a 1964 Playboy interview {{that he did not}} consider his character to be particularly evil or good: [...] "I don't think that he is necessarily a good guy <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> guy. Who is? He's got his vices and very few perceptible virtues except patriotism and courage, which are probably not virtues anyway... But I didn't intend for him to be a particularly likeable person." [...] Fleming agreed with some critics' characterisation of Bond as an unthinking killer, but expressed that he was a product of his time: [...] "James Bond is a healthy, violent, noncerebral man in his middle-thirties, and a creature of his era. I wouldn't say he's particularly typical of our times, but he's certainly of the times." ...|$|E

Executive producer John Shiban later explained that, since Doggett and Reyes were {{in control of the}} X-Files, the producers needed to give one of them a drive. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz was interested in taking Annabeth Gish's character into a darker area. According to Mat Hurwitz and Chris Knowles in their book The Complete X-Files, the episode deals with themes of [...] "reincarnation and the idea of karmic justice." [...] Shiban noted that the conceit of the episode was whether Reyes was [...] "a good person <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> person? Did she fight evil, or did she let evil happen." [...] It has been noted that the episode's plot is similar to mythology surrounding the Aztec agriculture god Xipe Totec.

Miller was assured by other CBS executives that Aubrey's silence meant things were fine– Kempton quoted a CBS producer telling Miller [...] "this {{has nothing to do with}} a good script <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> script. It has to do with pleasing one man, Jim Aubrey. Don't ever forget it"– and Miller later learned of efforts by Aubrey to force him out. (A pilot for the show, known as Calhoun and County Agent, to star Jackie Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck, was shot and put on the fall schedule, but the series was canceled before it ever aired.) Miller quoted an independent producer: [...] "Aubrey's the most important man in television, in the history of television, maybe in the history of entertainment. He out-Mayers Louis B. Mayer ten times over." ...|$|E

Matthew Wilkening of AOL Radio commented that the video leaves viewers to decide [...] "if it's a good thing <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> thing that the pair always end up reconciling." [...] Mikey Fresh of Vibe commented that Fox's natural reaction when Monaghan pierces the wall and almost hits her is an [...] "incredible act of vulnerability".

When the showrunners joined the series, they went on a [...] "mini-camp" [...] with Markus and McFeely to develop the series from a pilot script written by the pair. They looked to several different influences outside of Marvel in developing the series, including Raiders of the Lost Ark, L.A. Confidential, and the works of author James Ellroy. Elaborating on deviating from the comics, Fazekas said, for example, [...] "if we're using a minor character <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> guy from an old comic book, we don't have to adhere to what that character was in that comic book from 1945.

[...] ABC asked the producers to not have the series follow a [...] "Gadget of the Week or Bad Guy of the Week" [...] model, and instead focus on telling the story of Carter balancing her personal and professional lives. Fazekas called this [...] "such a nice change" [...] from previous television experience, with the group feeling free to drop whole story ideas in favor of focusing on the series' central storyline.|$|E

In the DVD commentary for the episode, Cary said that {{he came up with}} the segment after watching the 1997 horror film I Know What You Did Last Summer. [...] "I had just seen the movie and I was like, 'Hey, there you go.'" [...] he said. While Flanders serves as the segment's antagonist, the role would originally go to Grampa, who would chase Homer inside a roller disco. While Grampa does not appear in the segment, the Springfield Roller Disco is seen during the Simpsons escape from Flanders. Despite serving as writer for the segment, Cary left the series after finishing the first draft in order to work on the animated Austin Powers series, which never came to fruition. In his absence, the writing staff rewrote {{the last quarter of the}} segment and added the revelation that Flanders is a werewolf. In order to dispose of Ned Flanders' corpse, Homer throws his body into Flanders' house. After he is finished, he says [...] "That's the end of that chapter", a phrase that Cary often uses in his everyday life.
