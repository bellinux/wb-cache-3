5|$|As {{a result}} of the battle, the Abbasid forces were forced to {{withdraw}} from Syria, and Tulunid control over the province was reaffirmed.

5|$|After {{returning}} from tour, Warbrick moved to Napier, and in 1885 represented Hawke's Bay provincially, including captaining them against Poverty Bay.

He returned to Hawke's Bay for the 1887 season, and played for them against Wellington, Poverty Bay, and Canterbury. Warbrick had returned to Wellington by the 1888 season when he again played for the province.|$|E

5|$|Designed {{within the}} tight 35,000 ton {{limitations}} of the Washington Naval Treaty, wartime service necessitated increases over the design displacement, seriously reducing freeboard and affecting seaworthiness. This was most acute at the already low bow. With too little buoyancy forward the bows were easily buried even in moderate seas, with spray washing up <b>over</b> <b>both</b> forward turrets. Heavy seas could flood ‘A’ turret, drenching both men and machinery within.|$|E

Though, Blanc has yet to declare a permanent captain, Diarra has been declared the favorite to land the armband by several French news publications.|$|E

5|$|The main {{criticism}} levelled at the EIHL is {{that the}} league is too expensive, an accusation given credence {{by the collapse of}} the London Racers mid season in 2005, and the continued financial problems experienced by a number of other member clubs (most notably Basingstoke Bison and Manchester Phoenix in 2008–09).

5|$|Watt {{suggested}} {{that all three}} were brothers, John the first-born, William the second-born, and Walter {{the youngest of the}} three.

Margaret had patronage <b>over</b> <b>both</b> the church of Abernethy and, as probable owner of the barony of Inverarity, the church there.|$|E
5|$|Although Louis had {{designated}} Mary as {{his successor}} {{in both of}} his kingdoms, the Polish nobles, seeking {{an end to the}} personal union with Hungary, were not willing to recognize Mary and her fiancé Sigismund as their sovereigns. They would have accepted Mary if she had moved to Kraków and reigned <b>over</b> <b>both</b> kingdoms from there rather than from Hungary, ruling according to their advice rather than that of the Hungarian nobles and marrying a prince of their choosing. Their intentions, however, were not to Elizabeth's taste. She too would have been required to move to Kraków, where a lack of men loyal to her would have rendered her unable to enforce her own will. Elizabeth was also aware of the difficulties her mother-in-law had faced during her regency in Poland, which had ended with the old queen fleeing her native kingdom in disgrace.|$|E

5|$|An {{observational}} study by Logan {{demonstrates that the}} female is continuously {{evaluating the quality of}} the male and his territory. The assessment is usually triggered by the arrival of a new male in a neighboring territory {{at the beginning of a}} new breeding season. In those cases, the mated female is constantly seen flying <b>over</b> <b>both</b> the original and the new male’s territory, evaluating the qualities of both territories and exchanging calls with both males. The social mate displays aggressive behaviors towards the female, while the new male shows less aggression and sings softer songs. At the same time, both the mated male and the new male will fly over other territories to attract other females as well. Divorce, mate switching and extra-pair matings do occur in northern mockingbirds.|$|E
5|$|Bottas, Ricciardo, Magnussen and Räikkönen made pit {{stops to}} change to {{intermediate}} tyres on lap 12. After his early pit stop, Button moved up to eighth place on the lap. Massa and Vettel made their pit stops the following lap, with Vettel moving in front of Massa and rejoining ahead of teammate Ricciardo. Rosberg made his pit stop on the 14th lap and rejoined in second position, 22 seconds behind Hamilton (who recorded fast sector times {{in an attempt to}} move ahead of Rosberg after the latter's pit stop). Hamilton went off the track at the Spoon Curve, rejoining the race at the run-off area. The mistake reduced the time deficit by one second. Rosberg reclaimed first position when Hamilton approached the exit of the pit lane after the latter's stop. He reported that his car was oversteering, and Button held a 6.5-second advantage <b>over</b> <b>both</b> Williams cars. The Red Bull cars reduced the gap to Massa in sixth by lap 16, and began a challenge for the position. Vettel moved to the inside lane and passed Massa with a narrow margin at the hairpin on the lap. Although Ricciardo attempted a similar manoeuvre on the outside at the Spoon Curve, Massa accelerated clear heading into 130R corner.|$|E
5|$|Diocletian {{divided the}} empire into four regions, each {{ruled by a}} {{separate}} emperor, the Tetrarchy. Confident that he fixed the disorders that were plaguing Rome, he abdicated along with his co-emperor, and the Tetrarchy soon collapsed. Order was eventually restored by Constantine the Great, who became the first emperor to convert to Christianity, and who established Constantinople as the new capital of the eastern empire. During the decades of the Constantinian and Valentinian dynasties, the empire was divided along an east–west axis, with dual power centres in Constantinople and Rome. The reign of Julian, who attempted to restore Classical Roman and Hellenistic religion, only briefly interrupted the succession of Christian emperors. Theodosius I, the last emperor to rule <b>over</b> <b>both</b> East and West, died in 395 AD after making Christianity the official religion of the empire.|$|E

5|$|During {{the winter}} months in 1855 the players of Sheffield Cricket Club {{organised}} informal football matches in order to retain fitness until {{the start of the}} new season. Two of the players were Nathaniel Creswick (1826–1917) and William Prest (1832–1885), both of whom were born in Yorkshire. Creswick came from a Sheffield family of silver plate manufacturers that dated back several centuries. After being educated at the city's Collegiate School he became a solicitor. Prest's family had moved from York while he was a child. His father bought a wine merchants that William subsequently took <b>over.</b> <b>Both</b> men were keen sportsmen. Creswick enjoyed a number of sports including cricket and running. Prest played cricket for the All England XI and also captained Yorkshire on several occasions. The inaugural meeting of Sheffield F.C. took place on 24 October 1857 at Parkfield House in the suburb of Highfield. The original headquarters would become a greenhouse on East Bank Road. The adjacent field was used as their first playing ground.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his lecture}} series, Blackstone became more {{prominent}} in convocation and other university activities. Oxford and Cambridge {{at the time}} had a strange system of law; due to their unique natures, they had exclusive jurisdiction <b>over</b> <b>both</b> academics and students in a fashion which followed either the common law or their own customs, based on the civil law. With his appointment as assessor (or chief legal officer) of the Chancellor's Court, Blackstone became far {{more involved in the}} university's peculiar legal system, and records show him sitting between eight and ten times a year from 1753 to 1759, mainly dealing with small claims of debt. He also wrote a manual on the Court's practice, and through his position gained a large number of contacts and connections, as well as visibility, which aided his legal career significantly. This period also saw Blackstone write his last known piece of poetry, Friendship: An Ode, in 1756.|$|E
5|$|From the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War and the invasion of South Korea (also known as the Republic of Korea) by the North, the North Korean People's Army had enjoyed superiority in both manpower and equipment <b>over</b> <b>both</b> the Republic of Korea Armed Forces and the United Nations forces dispatched to South Korea to prevent it from collapsing. The North Korean strategy was to aggressively pursue UN and South Korean forces on all avenues of approach south and to engage them aggressively, attacking from the front and initiating a double envelopment of both flanks of the unit, which allowed the North Koreans to surround and cut off the opposing force, which would then be forced to retreat in disarray, often leaving behind much of its equipment. From their initial June 25 offensive to fights in July and early August, the North Koreans used this strategy to effectively defeat any UN force and push it south. However, when the UN forces, under the Eighth United States Army, established the Pusan Perimeter in August, the UN troops held a continuous line along the peninsula which North Korean troops could not flank, and their advantages in numbers decreased daily as the superior UN logistical system brought in more troops and supplies to the UN army.|$|E
