5|$|The {{parathyroid}} glands are {{two pairs}} of glands usually positioned behind {{the left and right}} lobes of the thyroid. Each gland is a yellowish-brown flat ovoid that resembles a lentil seed, usually about 6mm long and 3 to 4mm wide, and 1 to 2mm anteroposteriorly. There are typically four parathyroid glands. The two parathyroid glands on each side which are positioned higher are called the superior parathyroid glands, while the lower two are called the inferior parathyroid glands. Healthy parathyroid glands generally weigh about 30mg in men and 35mg in women. These glands are not visible <b>or</b> <b>able</b> to be felt during examination of the neck.|$|E
5|$|For {{its part}} the government, not {{consulting}} Solidarity, adopted {{a plan of}} economic measures {{that could only be}} implemented by force and asked parliament for extraordinary authority. In early December, Jaruzelski was pressured by his generals and colonels for an immediate forceful action and their demands were repeated at the Politburo meeting on 10 December. On 11 and 12 December Solidarity's National Commission declared 17 December the day of countrywide protest. Neither the exhausted but radicalized Solidarity nor the ruling establishment was willing <b>or</b> <b>able</b> to back down and, in the era of Brezhnev, there could be no peaceful resolution to the situation that developed. The Soviets now expressed a preference for the conflict to be resolved by the Polish authorities, but Poland, according to Karol Modzelewski, was lucky to avoid a carnage of foreign intervention. Others, including the historian Antoni Dudek, feel that there was no sufficient justification for the imposition of martial law that followed.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century, a {{midshipman}} was {{a rating}} for an experienced seaman, {{and the word}} derives from the area aboard a ship, amidships, either where the original rating worked on the ship, or where he was berthed. Beginning in the 18th century, a commissioned officer candidate was rated as a midshipman, and the seaman rating began to slowly die out. By the Napoleonic era (1793–1815), a midshipman was an apprentice officer who had previously served {{at least three years}} as a volunteer, officer's servant <b>or</b> <b>able</b> seaman, and was roughly equivalent to a present-day petty officer in rank and responsibilities. After serving at least three years as a midshipman or master's mate, he was eligible to take the examination for lieutenant. Promotion to lieutenant was not automatic, and many midshipmen took positions as master's mates for an increase in pay and responsibility aboard ship. Midshipmen in the United States Navy were trained and served similarly to midshipman in the Royal Navy, although unlike their counterparts in the Royal Navy, a midshipman was a warrant officer rank until 1912.|$|E

25|$|The {{level of}} {{salinity}} {{can also be}} quite variable. Low salinities {{can be caused by}} rainwater or river inputs of freshwater. Estuarine species must be especially euryhaline, <b>or</b> <b>able</b> to tolerate a wide range of salinities. High salinities occur in locations with high evaporation rates, such as in salt marshes and high intertidal pools. Shading by plants, especially in the salt marsh, can slow evaporation and thus ameliorate salinity stress. In addition, salt marsh plants tolerate high salinities by several physiological mechanisms, including excreting salt through salt glands and preventing salt uptake into the roots.|$|E
25|$|A {{claystone}} is lithified, and non-fissile mudrock. In {{order for}} a rock {{to be considered a}} claystone, it must consist of up to fifty percent clay, which measures less than 1/256 of a millimeter in particle size. Clay minerals are integral to mudrocks, and represent the first or second most abundant constituent by volume. There are 35 recognized clay mineral species on Earth. They make muds cohesive and plastic, <b>or</b> <b>able</b> to flow. Clay is by far the smallest particles recognized in mudrocks. Most materials in nature are clay minerals, but quartz, feldspar, iron oxides, and carbonates can weather to sizes of a typical clay mineral.|$|E

25|$|GC is {{a method}} {{involving}} the separation of different analytes within a sample of mixed gases. The separated gases can be detected multiple ways, {{but one of the}} most powerful detection methods for gas chromatography is mass spectrometry. After the gases separate, they enter the mass spectrometer and are analyzed. This combination not only separates the analytes, but gives structural information about each one. The GC sample must be volatile, <b>or</b> <b>able</b> to enter the gas phase, while also being thermally stable so that it does not break down as it is heated to enter the gas phase. Mass spectrometry ionization techniques requiring the sample to be in the gas phase have similar concerns.|$|E
25|$|At this juncture, a {{protectorate}} by the Commonwealth was {{sought by}} the leaders of Hungary, Transylvania and Moldavia. Actively pursuing these relations would require confronting the Habsburg Monarchy. Not willing <b>or</b> <b>able</b> to do so, King John III decided to join the Holy League (1684), an anti-Ottoman alliance and the last European crusade project, consisting also of the papal state, Venice and the Holy Roman Empire. The pact's basic goals were recovery of the lost territories and common fight until the time of a commonly agreed peace. The Holy League arrangements severely limited the Commonwealth's ability to exercise its options and future reverses {{can be traced to}} the failure of the decentralized, ineffective Polish diplomacy to protect through negotiations the country's national interest.|$|E

Leipheimer {{finished}} {{eighth in}} his first Tour but crashed {{out of the race}} on the first stage of the 2003 Tour de France. Leipheimer finished ninth overall the following year. The team became more of a Grand Tour team as could be seen by Michael Rasmussen's win in the Mountains Classification of the 2005 Tour de France. When Denis Menchov took the lead in the 2005 Vuelta a España, he was not expecting to be competing for the overall classification The Rabobank team at that year's Vuelta were not seen as particularly strong <b>or</b> <b>able</b> to assist Menchov in the mountain stages. Menchov finished second to Roberto Heras which was the highest placing of a Rabobank team rider at a grand tour after Michael Boogerd's fifth place in the 1998 Tour de France.

25|$|Revolutionary {{activity}} was fragmented {{because of the}} lack of strong central leadership and guidance. However, the Greek side withstood the Turkish attacks, because, during the same period, the Ottoman military campaigns were periodic, and the Ottoman presence in the rebel areas uncoordinated due to logistical problems. The cash-strapped Ottoman state, whose always difficult relations with Russia had been made worse by the hanging the Patriarch Grigorios, and the Sublime Porte needed to concentrate substantial forces on borders with Russia in case war should break out. From October 1820 to July 1823, the Ottomans were at war with Persia, and in March 1823 a huge fire at the Tophana military arsenal in Constantinople destroyed much of the Ottoman state's supplies of ammunition and its main cannon foundry. Short of men and money, the Ottoman state turned to hiring Albanian tribesmen to fight the Greeks, and by 1823, the bulk of the Ottoman forces in Greece were Albanian mercenaries hired for a campaigning season rather than the Ottoman Army. The Albanian tribesmen, whose style of war was very similar to the Greeks, fought only for money and were liable to go home when not paid <b>or</b> <b>able</b> to plunder in lieu of pay. The Greek military leaders preferred battlefields where they could annihilate the numerical superiority of the opponent, and, at the same time, the lack of artillery hampered Ottoman military efforts.|$|E
25|$|The United States' {{entry into}} World War II impeded Baldwin's Diesel {{development}} program when the War Production Board dictated that Alco and Baldwin produce only steamers and Diesel-electric yard switching engines. Electro-Motive Division (EMD) was assigned {{the task of}} producing road freight Diesels (namely, the FT series). EMD's distinct advantage over its competitors in that product line {{in the years that}} followed World War II, due to the head start in diesel R and production, is beyond doubt, however, assigning it solely to WPB directives is questionable. Longtime GM chairman Alfred P. Sloan presented a timeline in his memoir that belies this assumption, saying that GM's diesel-engine R efforts of the 1920s and 1930s, and its application of model design standardization (yielding lower unit costs) and marketing lessons learned in the automotive industry, were the principal reason for EMD's competitive advantage in the late 1940s and afterward (clearly implying that the wartime production assignments were merely nails in a coffin that Baldwin and Lima had already built for themselves before the war). In his telling, the R needed to adapt earlier Diesels (best suited to marine and stationary use) to locomotive use (smaller; higher power-to-weight ratio; more reliable given more vibration and less maintenance) was a capital-intensive project that almost no one among the railroad owners or locomotive builders was willing (latter) <b>or</b> <b>able</b> (former) to invest in during the 1920s and 1930s, save the people of Winton, Electro-Motive, and Charles F. Kettering of the GM Research Corporation.|$|E
