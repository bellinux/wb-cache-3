In this note, a poset map is {{constructed}} from a Boolean algebra to Bruhat order which unveils an intriguing connection be-tween subword complexes, sorting orders, Bruhat order and certain totally nonnegative spaces; this relationship gives a simple new {{proof that the}} proper part of Bruhat order is homotopy equiva-lent to the proper part of a Boolean algebra, i. e. to a sphere.
