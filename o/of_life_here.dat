'Unless we restore the dance <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>here</b> on Dune, the dragon {{on the floor of the}} desert will be no more.'

[...] Samoan society is, {{in the words of the}} BBC, [...] "deeply conservative and devoutly Christian".|$|E

60|$|THE DEVIL. I still fail to see, Senor Don Juan, {{that these}} episodes in your earthly career {{and in that}} of the Senor Commander in any way {{discredit}} my view <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> <b>Here,</b> I repeat, you have all that you sought without anything that you shrank from.|$|E

50|$|The 19th-century artist, Antoine Plamondon, (ca. 1804-1895) {{moved here}} by 1850, with his mother, {{a brother and}} sister. He lived the rest <b>of</b> his <b>life</b> <b>here,</b> more than 40 years.|$|R

60|$|Four {{miles west}} of the town, {{at the mouth of the}} Tallabacoa River, stood a large fort built of {{railroad}} iron and surrounded by earthworks. The Peoria ran boldly in and fired several shots from her 3-pounders, but brought no response and no signs <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> <b>Here</b> was thought to be the desired opportunity, and another scouting party was organised.

6000|$|... "These old gentlemen," [...] thought he, [...] "are {{no doubt}} very {{valuable}} writers, {{but they seem}} to me conspicuously ignorant <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> <b>Here</b> am I, with learning enough to be a Bishop, and I positively {{do not know how to}} dispose of a stolen diamond.

It is deemed a fit type of all-forsaken overthrow, that the jackal should den in the wastes of weedy Babylon; but the Encantadas refuse to harbor even the outcasts of the beasts. Man and wolf alike disown them. Little but reptile life is here found: tortoises, lizards, immense spiders, snakes, and that strangest anomaly of outlandish nature, the aguano.

We, who merely talk and dream our days away, and who would lift never a hand for God, or country, or the devil, are pledged knights of the Little Lady." ...|$|E
