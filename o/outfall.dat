40|$|From July through October of 1991, the Biological Resources Evaluation Team (BRET) {{surveyed}} 133 of the 140 National Pollutant Discharge and Elimination System <b>outfalls</b> at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). The {{purpose of}} the survey {{was to determine the}} use of these wastewater <b>outfalls</b> by wildlife. BRET observed wildlife or evidence of wildlife (scat, tracks, or bedding) by 35 vertebrate species {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>outfalls,</b> suggesting these animals could be using water from <b>outfalls.</b> Approximately 56 % of the <b>outfalls</b> are probably used or are suitable for use by large mammals as sources of drinking water. Additionally, hydrophytic vegetation grows in association with approximately 40 % of the outfalls-a characteristic that could make these areas eligible for wetland status. BRET recommends further study to accurately characterize the use of <b>outfalls</b> by small and medium-sized mammals and amphibians. The team also recommends systematic aquatic macroinvertebrate studies to provide information on resident communities and water quality. Wetland assessments may be necessary to ensure compliance with wetland regulations if LANL activities affect any of the <b>outfalls</b> supporting hydrophytic vegetation...|$|R
40|$|The Department of Energy (DOE) {{proposes to}} {{eliminate}} industrial effluent from 27 <b>outfalls</b> at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). The Proposed Action includes both simple and extensive plumbing modifications, which {{would result in}} the elimination of industrial effluent being released to the environment through 27 <b>outfalls.</b> The industrial effluent currently going to about half of the 27 <b>outfalls</b> under consideration would be rerouted to LANL`s sanitary sewer system. Industrial effluent from other <b>outfalls</b> would be eliminated by replacing once-through cooling water systems with recirculation systems, or, in a few instances, operational changes would result in no generation of industrial effluent. After the industrial effluents have been discontinued, the affected <b>outfalls</b> would be removed from the NPDES Permit. The pipes from the source building or structure to the discharge point for the <b>outfalls</b> may be plugged, or excavated and removed. Other <b>outfalls</b> would remain intact and would continue to discharge stormwater. The No Action alternative, which would maintain the status quo for LANL`s <b>outfalls,</b> was also analyzed. An alternative in which industrial effluent would be treated at the source facilities was considered but dismissed from further analysis because it would not reasonably meet the DOE`s purpose for action, and its potential environmental effects were bounded by the analysis of the Proposed Action and the No Action alternatives...|$|R

40|$|Natural Flood Management (NFM) {{techniques}} aim {{to reduce}} downstream flooding by storing and slowing {{the flow of}} stormwater to river channels. These techniques include a range of measures, including setback stormwater <b>outfalls</b> and the physical restoration of channels and floodplains, to improve the natural functioning of catchments. An additional benefit of NFM measures is the potential reduction in sediment and pollutant delivery to the channel. Urban development releases a variety of heavy metal and nutrient pollutants that enter rivers through stormwater <b>outfalls</b> with adverse effects on the aquatic ecosystem. In this study, the influence of channel modification {{and quality of the}} river habitat on the sediment quality surrounding stormwater <b>outfalls</b> was assessed. Sediment samples were taken at several <b>outfalls</b> within the Johnson Creek catchment, Oregon, USA, and analysed for a variety of urban pollutants. The level of river habitat quality and modification at each site were assessed using a semi-quantitative scoring methodology. Significant increases in pollutant levels were observed at <b>outfalls,</b> with a greater and more variable increase at direct compared to setback <b>outfalls.</b> Removal efficiency of certain pollutants was found to be significantly correlated to the level of habitat quality or modification (for Fe, Ba, Sn, Mg, P, K) indicating that more natural reaches had greater potential for pollutant removal. The findings highlight the multiple benefits associated with NFM and river restoration approaches in relation to sediment quality and pollutant content...|$|R
40|$|Wastewater <b>outfalls</b> are an {{important}} part of human life and the marine ecosystem. The capstone review describes alterations caused by effluents at the molecular, microbial and ecosystem levels, to the areas near <b>outfalls.</b> Chemical and microbial substances are being released into the water, regardless of the type of wastewater treatment. Endocrine disruptors, trace metals and organochlorine compounds are present, and can affect the marine ecosystem. The different methods for detecting or assessing fecal contamination have improved over the years by using microbial parameters. The mortality rate of microbial organisms in seawater close to the <b>outfalls</b> is {{an important}} factor when considering the best parameter for assessing water quality and potential microbial impact. Fish behaviors and cellular enzymatic reactions are being affected by chemical substances at the cellular level. The fundamental behaviors of organisms are being altered by the feminization of fish species, affecting their ability to mate. Nutrients introduced from <b>outfalls</b> are altering benthic, coral reef and fish communities and impacting the natural balance of the ecosystem...|$|R
5|$|A new {{main drain}} to Wiggenhall St Germans was {{completed}} in 1848, which provided better drainage because the <b>outfall</b> was lower than that at Salters Lode. Whittlesey Mere, the last remaining lake, was drained soon afterwards, {{using one of the}} first applications of John Appold's centrifugal pump, following its appearance at the Great Exhibition in 1851. Traffic on the network began to diminish after the opening of the railway through March in 1846, and fell dramatically in the early twentieth century. The last regular commercial traffic was the tanker barge Shellfen, which delivered fuel oil to pumping stations until 1971.|$|E
5|$|The first Curry Moor {{pumping station}} {{was built in}} 1864, to house a steam engine and pump. A cottage for the {{operator}} was built next to {{it at the same}} time. This installation lasted until 1955, when a new pumphouse was constructed to house two diesel pumps. The steam engine was retained for historical reasons, and is located in part of the new building. The diesel pumps were supplemented by an electric pump in 1983, and a programme of refurbishment was carried out in 2008, which included {{the construction of a new}} <b>outfall</b> into the river.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Holderness scheme, {{there were}} still {{problems}} near Leven and Weel, and William Jessop spent a month inspecting the area before writing a report in July 1786. His plan advocated separating the water which fell on the uplands {{to the north and}} flowed through the low-lying areas, from the local drainage of those low-lying areas. George Plummer carried out most of the subsequent survey work on Jessop's behalf, although Jessop surveyed the River Hull in 1787, to identify how the <b>outfall</b> could be improved. Jessop visited the works from time to time, making seven visits between 1789 and 1792, while the day to day oversight of the scheme was handled by Plummer as resident engineer. Plummer was succeeded by Anthony Bower, who was engineer from 1792 to 1795, and the whole scheme was completed in 1805, having cost £16,000.|$|E

40|$|The <b>outfalls</b> of {{the eight}} tributaries {{entering}} Grand Lake-St. Marys were monitored during the eleven month period from August, 1972 through June, 1973. Both biological and physical parameters were measured at all sites. The biological parameters that were measured included; fecal coliforms, fecal streptococci, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Proteus spp., seudomonas,aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. The physical parameters were; pH, turbidity, water temperature, dissolved oxygen and local rainfall. All eight <b>outfalls</b> were shown to exceed the limits recommended by the U. S. Public Health Service for fecal coliform counts. The ratio of fecal coliforms to fecal streptococci suggested that the pollution came from both human and animal wastes that were carried into the lake in stormwater runoff. The low fecal counts obtained away from the tributaries, {{in the center of}} the lake, indicated that the lake was able to recover from the pollution entering at the <b>outfalls.</b> Primary contact recreation in the vicinity of the tributary <b>outfalls</b> is not recommended but the remainder of the lake presents no apparent health hazard.

5|$|Several {{prominent}} {{civil engineer}} considered {{the problems of}} Deeping Fen and the river <b>outfall</b> {{at the end of}} the 1700s. Two reports were produced, one by George Maxwell, and the second by Edward Hare, who had been assisted by William Jessop and John Rennie. They formed the basis for the Deeping Fen Act of 1801. The channel above Spalding was made deeper, the north bank was made stronger, and the North and South Drove Drains were enlarged through the fen. One of Rennie's recommendations had been to replace the windmills which drove the drainage pumps with a steam pumping station at Pode Hole, but this was not implemented. After reports by Rennie and Thomas Pear in 1815, and by Rennie alone in 1818 and 1820, the provision of steam engines was authorised by an act in 1823. The trustees appointed by the 1801 act continued to manage Deeping Fen until they were replaced in 1939 by the Deeping Fen, Spalding and Pinchbeck Internal Drainage Board, subsequently renamed the Welland & Deepings Internal Drainage Board.|$|E
5|$|The River Don Navigation {{ended at}} Tinsley Wharf, but {{it forms a}} {{convenient}} place to start {{a description of the}} route. The wharf was on the river, just upstream from the present junction with the canal to Sheffield. It was close {{to the site of the}} Meadowhall Shopping Centre and the Tinsley Viaduct, which carries the M1 motorway over the valley of the River Don. From here there is a towpath along the canal to Victoria Quays (formerly Sheffield Basin) in Sheffield City Centre, or the Five Weirs Walk follows the course of the River Don to the same destination. The towpath extends to Rotherham in the opposite direction, passing the large Jordans Weir and the three locks on the Holmes Cut. Beside Jordans Weir is the <b>outfall</b> from Blackburn Meadows sewage treatment plant. In dry weather, this discharges 30 million gallons (136,000m3) of treated water each day, more than doubling the flow in the river.|$|E
5|$|The smell, and people's {{fears of}} its {{possible}} effects, prompted {{action from the}} local and national administrators who had been considering possible solutions for the problem. The authorities accepted a proposal from the civil engineer Joseph Bazalgette to move the effluent eastwards along a series of interconnecting sewers that sloped towards outfalls beyond the metropolitan area. Work on high-, mid- and low-level systems for the new Northern and Southern <b>Outfall</b> Sewers started {{at the beginning of}} 1859 and lasted until 1875. To aid the drainage, pumping stations were placed to lift the sewage from lower levels into higher pipes. Two of the more ornate stations, Abbey Mills in Stratford and Crossness on the Erith Marshes, are listed for protection by English Heritage. Bazalgette's plan introduced the three embankments to London in which the sewers ran—the Victoria, Chelsea and Albert Embankments.|$|E

40|$|A study {{modelling}} effluent dispersion {{is underway}} for Darwin Harbour, a large macrotidal tropical estuary. The behaviour of contaminants released from sewage <b>outfalls</b> {{needs to be}} assessed for licensing requirements. The RMA suite of models (in particular RMA- 10 and RMA- 11) has been applied using a previously developed model mesh. RMA- 10 is a three dimensional finite element hydrodynamic model while RMA- 11 solves the advection and diffusion equations in three dimensions for defined contaminants given previously determined hydrodynamic results. Initial studies have focussed on a notional conservative contaminant and model calibration has been undertaken using previously performed dye studies from the sewage <b>outfalls</b> of interest. Some mesh refinement has been required. The flow field is produced for 30 day periods from RMA- 10 using tidal data. The contaminant is then released into the flow field and dispersion determined over the modelling period using RMA- 11. Visualisation of results has been achieved using maximum concentration plume maps, time plots and plume animations. Areas having concentrations greater than half the regulatordefined trigger values have been determined for the notional conservative contaminant. These affected ‘mixing zones’ are largest in area (3 to 4 km 2) for the Ludmilla and Palmerston <b>outfalls.</b> Berrimah and Larrakeyah <b>outfalls</b> have respectively one and two orders of magnitude lower maximum contaminant concentrations. The affected areas are very small for these two <b>outfalls.</b> Current modelling is for two dimensional elements. However the study will be extended to three dimensions in future work...|$|R
5|$|The fen was {{inundated}} in 1798, and {{the civil}} engineers William Jessop and John Rennie were asked to assist the local engineers Edward Hare and George Maxwell. There was a clear understanding that the outfalls were too high to allow proper drainage by gravity, and two possible solutions were considered. The first was an <b>outfall</b> at a lower level, which would involve hugh expense in its construction, and the second, favoured by Jessop and Rennie, was the provision of steam pumping engines at Pode Hole. These would pump water from the internal drains of the fen to Vernatt's Drain, and the lower internal water levels would allow the existing wind-powered drainage mills to work efficiently. A report was produced, which {{formed the basis for}} the Deeping Fen Act of 1801. The channel of the Welland above Spalding was made deeper, the north bank was made stronger, and the North and South Drove Drains which crossed the fen to join Vernatt's Drain at Pode Hole were made deeper. At the time there were no steam engines working in the fens, and Rennie's recommendation of a steam pumping station at Pode Hole was not implemented.|$|E
5|$|With {{the passing}} of the Land Drainage Act 1930, the Welland Catchment Board was created. They had spent £91,537 on the <b>outfall</b> by 1937. Towards the end of the Second World War, E. G. Taverner, the chief {{engineer}} for the drainage board, devised a plan to relieve flooding in Spalding by creating a bypass channel, and building the Greatford Cut to divert the waters of the West Glen river into the Welland upstream of Market Deeping. The scheme cost £723,000, with much of the work being carried out by W. & C. French, and the Coronation Channel around Spalding was opened in September 1953. Fulney lock was constructed {{at the same time to}} exclude the tide from the upper river, as was the Maxey Cut, an embanked channel that bypasses the villages of Market Deeping, Deeping Gate and Deeping St James. During the 1960s and 1970s, several sections of the river above Stamford were made straighter and deeper, to reduce the risk of flooding of agricultural land. To address the habitat and environmental issues causes by such engineering work, the Welland Rivers Trust, a limited company and charitable trust, was set up in 2010. They are seeking to direct regeneration of the river by co-ordinating various organisations, which are known collectively as the Welland Valley Partnership. They published a major document outlining their proposals in February 2013.|$|E
