5|$|Pepys was {{a senior}} {{official}} in the Navy Office by then, and he ascended the Tower of London <b>on</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning</b> to view the fire from a turret. He recorded in his diary that the eastern gale had {{turned it into a}} conflagration. It had burned down several churches and, he estimated, 300 houses and reached the river front. The houses on London Bridge were burning.|$|E
5|$|Between 2:00am and 3:00am <b>on</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning,</b> July 22, {{the peace}} was again broken and fire alarms began to ring {{throughout}} the city. To the west, at the Mount Clare Shops of the B, a 37-car train of coal and oil {{had been set}} on fire. Police, firefighters, and thousands of citizens flocked to the scene. A contingent of 50 marines was dispatched to the area to provide assistance. The cars which had not yet caught fire were detached from those burning, {{and by the time}} the flames were extinguished between seven and nine cars had been burned. Between $11,000 and $12,000 in damage was sustained.|$|E
5|$|On 19 March 1931, {{even before}} Arizona was put through post-modernization sea trials, she hosted President Herbert Hoover {{for a brief}} {{vacation}} in the Caribbean. The President visited Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Returning on 29 March, Arizona conducted her sea trials at Rockland, Maine, and had another catapult fitted {{on the top of}} Turret III, before she was transferred to the West Coast in August with her sister Pennsylvania. In February 1932, the ship participated in Grand Joint Exercise No. 4 in which carrier aircraft successfully attacked Pearl Harbor <b>on</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning,</b> 7 February. After returning to the West Coast from Fleet ProblemXIV in 1933, the ship was anchored in San Pedro when an earthquake struck nearby Long Beach, California, on 10 March. Sailors from the ship joined the relief efforts, providing food, treating the injured and providing security from looters.|$|E

5|$|<b>On</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning,</b> April 25, 1999, Roger Troutman was fatally wounded as {{a result}} of an {{apparent}} murder-suicide that was orchestrated by his older brother, Larry. Roger was shot several times in the torso by Larry as he exited a recording studio in Dayton, Ohio. Roger was taken to Good Samaritan Hospital, but died shortly after. Larry's body was found in a car a short distance away from the murder scene. There were no witnesses at the time, and Larry's motive for the murder of Roger remains unclear; however, there were increasingly large troubles over money surrounding Larry who managed the family-run housing company, Troutman Enterprises. The business filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy, owing $400,000 in delinquent taxes. Larry was also possibly angry over Roger firing him as manager for his music career, of which Larry had been for several years.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the track}} was {{reported}} clear of debris, the safety car was withdrawn {{and the race}} restarted on lap five. Jonathan Palmer, commentating alongside Murray Walker for the BBC, remarked how quick Schumacher was, as {{his time in the}} warm-up session <b>on</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning</b> gave rise to speculation {{that he was going to}} make one pit stop and, therefore, race with a heavier car than Senna, who was planning to make two, as was conventional. Martin Brundle had told BBC presenter Steve Rider that McLaren were going to make two stops. On the second lap after the restart, with Ayrton Senna leading Michael Schumacher, Senna's car left the road at the Tamburello corner, and after slowing from 190mph (306km/h) to 131mph (211km/h), hit the concrete wall, with debris flying into the path of the other drivers.|$|E
5|$|Around midnight <b>on</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning,</b> March 18, 1990, a red Dodge Daytona {{pulled up}} near the side {{entrance}} of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum along Palace Road. Two men with fake police uniforms waited {{for at least an}} hour in the car, possibly trying to avoid being noticed by people leaving a St. Patrick's Day party nearby. Later at around 1a.m., security guard Richard Abath returned to the front desk after patrolling the museum to switch positions with the other security guard. The two guards were the only people in the building. At this time, Abath opened and quickly shut the Palace Road door, claiming he was trained to do this to ensure the door was locked. He claimed security logs from other nights would show that he had done this many times previously. The FBI has seized the logs, but has not commented on the issue further.|$|E

5|$|Loeb, driving an all new CitroÃ«n C4 WRC car {{which had}} been in {{development}} throughout 2006, {{took control of the}} race from the outset, winning the two stages on the first day and four more stages over the following three days. His teammate Sordo kept the pressure on, winning three stages, but on Stage 6, Loeb extended his lead from 6.6 seconds to nearly 24 seconds, and from thereon became unattainable. Each stage on the first two Legs were won by either Loeb or Sordo, and it wasn't until Saturday afternoon on the second run of the day's stages, that other drivers could effectively challenge them. The last two days of the race consisted of a duel between Mikko Hirvonen, who drove a factory 2006 model Ford Focus RS WRC, and Chris Atkinson in a factory Subaru Impreza WRC 2006. After Hirvonen completed Stage 2 in fourth place, Atkinson took the position on Stage 3 and held onto it throughout Friday and into Saturday morning's stages. On Stage 12 on Saturday afternoon, Hirvonen retook fourth, Atkinson regained it on Stage 13 but then lost it to Hirvonen again following Stage 14. Atkinson won the final stage <b>on</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning,</b> and finished the race back in fourth position.|$|E
5|$|The {{conditions}} for the race were dry, with a capacity crowd of some 40,000 fans turning out to watch the race. The drivers took to the track <b>on</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning</b> for a 30-minute warm-up session. Both Williams cars maintained their good performance from qualifying; Coulthard was fastest with teammate Hill in second. Schumacher completed the top three positions. Herbert and Katayama both suffered from gearbox problems with their race cars, and elected to start the race with their teams' spare cars. The Simtek team did not {{take part in the}} session, as both drivers waited for stronger suspension components flown out from the United Kingdom to be fitted to the cars for the race. Minutes before the race started, a press release from the FIA was given to all media and team personnel, notifying them that the chromatographic analysis of the Elf fuel samples taken from Schumacher's Benetton and the Coulthard's Williams during qualifying did not match the sample provided by the fuel company {{before the start of the}} season for reference purposes, thus rendering both cars illegal. Both teams were fined $30,000 and raced under appeal, as the standard penalty for the offence was disqualification from the event. Neither Schumacher nor Coulthard were informed of the situation, as the teams did not want to unsettle their drivers before the race start. Hill and Herbert's races were not affected by the judgement, despite using the same type of fuel. Samples from Ferrari's Agip and McLaren's Mobil fuel were also tested; both were in accordance with the regulations. Though 26cars qualified for the race, only 25 took the start: Martini retired on the parade lap, his Minardi car suffering a gearbox problem.|$|E
