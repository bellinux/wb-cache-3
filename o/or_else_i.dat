500|$|In 1991 Miguel {{released}} his eighth studio album, Romance, {{a collection of}} classic boleros, the oldest of which originated in the 1940s. The album, which was produced by Armando Manzanero and arranged by Bebu Silvetti, was a commercial success in Latin America and sold over seven million copies worldwide. It revived interest in the bolero genre {{and was the first}} record by a Spanish-speaking artist to be certified gold in Brazil, Taiwan, and the United States. In spite of the album's success, Miguel did not want to release a follow-up record that was similar to Romance. When asked why he chose not to record more boleros, he replied [...] "I wanted to try my music, just forgetting a little bit about those boleros that everyone knows". He began working with the composers for the album a year before recording in a studio in 1992; in Miguel's words, he wanted to [...] "discuss the works, the themes, and melodies;...The creation of an album has to be part of me <b>or</b> <b>else</b> <b>I</b> {{would not be able to}} interpret it, or sing in it".|$|E

2500|$|On {{the night}} of the murder, 16/17 December 1916, Rasputin was invited to Felix's {{apartment}} at the Moika Palace. He was told that Irina would be in residence and Rasputin would have an opportunity to meet her. Rasputin had often expressed interest in meeting the beautiful 21-year-old princess. Irina, however, was on a visit to the Crimea. Irina had been aware that Felix had talked about eliminating Rasputin and it was originally intended that she participate in the murder. [...] "You too must take part in it," [...] Felix wrote to her before the murder. [...] "Dm(itri) Pavl(ovich) knows all about it and is helping. It will all take place in the middle of December, when Dm(itri) comes back." [...] In late November 1916, Irina wrote to Felix: [...] "Thanks for your insane letter. I didn't understand the half of it. I see that you're planning to do something wild. Please take care and do not get mixed up in any shady business. The dirtiest thing is that you have decided to do it all without me. I don't see how I can take part in it now, since it's all arranged... In a word, be careful.
