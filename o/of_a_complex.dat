It is typically created by the emplacement and compaction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>complex</b> semi-plastic mound of various compositions of soil, sand, clay and/or rock. It has a semi-permanent natural waterproof covering for its surface, and a dense, waterproof core. This makes such a dam impervious to surface or seepage erosion.|$|E

5|$|Any nonrational power <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>complex</b> {{number has}} an {{infinite}} number of possible values because of the multi-valued nature of the complex logarithm. The principal value is a single value chosen from these by a rule which, amongst its other properties, ensures powers of complex numbers with a positive real part and zero imaginary part give the same value as does the rule defined above for the corresponding real base.|$|E

5|$|The set of nth roots <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>complex</b> number w is {{obtained}} by multiplying the principal value w1/n {{by each of}} the nth roots of unity.

50|$|The {{elements}} of the individual groups <b>of</b> <b>a</b> chain <b>complex</b> are called chains (or cochains in the case <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cochain <b>complex.)</b> The image of d is the group of boundaries, or in <b>a</b> cochain <b>complex,</b> coboundaries. The kernel of d (i.e., the subgroup sent to 0 by d) is the group of cycles, {{or in the case}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cochain <b>complex,</b> cocycles. From the basic relation, the (co)boundaries lie inside the (co)cycles. This phenomenon is studied in a systematic way using (co)homology groups.|$|R
5|$|This {{characteristic}} {{is employed}} in analytical techniques using EDTA as a ligand.

Beryllium(II) readily forms complexes with strong donating ligands such as phosphine oxides and arsine oxides.

5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} can be {{seen from}} a variety of viewpoints. A synthesized research definition of cognitive flexibility is a switch in thinking, whether that is specifically based on a switch in rules or broadly based on a need to switch one’s previous beliefs or thoughts to new situations. Moreover, it refers to simultaneously considering multiple aspects of thought at once, whether they be two aspects of a specific object, or many aspects <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>complex</b> situation. Other terms for and components of cognitive flexibility include mental flexibility, mental set shifting, cognitive shifting, task switching/shifting, and attention switching/shifting.|$|E
5|$|El Greco made Toledo his home. Surviving {{contracts}} mention him as {{the tenant}} from 1585 onwards <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>complex</b> consisting of three apartments and twenty-four rooms which belonged to the Marquis de Villena. It was in these apartments, which also served as his workshop, that he passed {{the rest of his}} life, painting and studying. He lived in considerable style, sometimes employing musicians to play whilst he dined. It is not confirmed whether he lived with his Spanish female companion, Jerónima de Las Cuevas, whom he probably never married. She was the mother of his only son, Jorge Manuel, born in 1578, who also became a painter, assisted his father, and continued to repeat his compositions for many years after he inherited the studio. In 1604, Jorge Manuel and Alfonsa de los Morales gave birth to El Greco's grandson, Gabriel, who was baptized by Gregorio Angulo, governor of Toledo and a personal friend of the artist.|$|E

She, however, has pledged her love for Florindo, who is at the centre <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>complex</b> tangle of infatuations: he is secretly loved by Alfirena and more openly by the scheming shepherdess Lycoris, who in turn is the object of the shepherd Damon's desires. The various would-be lovers are consoled or advised by Damon's friend Thyrsis, and by the ageing nymph Galathea, who has herself not quite given up on love, though her advances to Thyrsis are rejected. Daphne and Florindo prepare to marry, but Apollo remains hopeful and continues his suit. Lycoris is prepared to await the outcome of events, but Damon, Galathea and Alfirena are in despair, as the opera ends with another spectacular celebration in honour of Apollo.|$|E
5|$|Green {{is common}} in nature, as many plants are green because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>complex</b> {{chemical}} known as chlorophyll, which is involved in photosynthesis. Chlorophyll absorbs the long wavelengths of light (red) and short wavelengths of light (blue) much more efficiently than the wavelengths that appear green to the human eye, so light reflected by plants is enriched in green. Chlorophyll absorbs green light poorly because it first arose in organisms living in oceans where purple halobacteria were already exploiting photosynthesis. Their purple color arose because they extracted energy in the green portion of the spectrum using bacteriorhodopsin. The new organisms that then later came to dominate the extraction of light were selected to exploit those portions of the spectrum not used by the halobacteria.|$|E

The Mughal architectural influence is seen in all the spiral shaped towers which have gold plated spires, except the tower over the main shrine which is said to be in Sikh architectural style. The niches in the walls of the shrines are decorated with 300 well crafted images of deities. The paintings in the 15 panels of the main shrine are based on themes from Ramayana, Mahabharata, and Bhagavad Gita.|$|E
