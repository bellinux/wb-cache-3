40|$|Social {{epistemology}} is a many-splendored subject. 1 Different theorists adopt {{different approaches}} and the options are quite diverse, often orthogonal to one another.

In this paper I explain and motivate the knowledge-centered approach by contrasting it with a newly emerging alternative that has a definite appeal <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>own.</b> <b>According</b> to this alternative, the chief dimension of social epistemological interest would be rationality rather than knowledge.

40|$|Although {{the social}} aspects of economical, {{juridical}} and religious activities in ancient Athens {{have long been}} acknowledged, I argue in my dissertation that the consequences of these insights have been insufficiently appreciated. In most studies of Athenian society an institutional or constitutional approach still prevails. Many scholars commonly describe Athenian society {{in black and white}} terms as consisting {{of a small group of}} politically active, Athenian-born, adult men opposite a large group of non-citizens, including women, metics, and slaves. However, many ancient sources, from court trials to sacred laws, abundantly demonstrate that membership of the polis was not defined as a legal status with political privileges but was rather conceived of in terms of sharing or participating in the community (as metechein tes poleos), especially in the religious obligations (ta hiera) of the polis. This notion has several important consequences that can be further explored. For instance, it is one of the main aims of Professor Josine Blok’s VICI-project on Athenian citizenship at the University of Utrecht, of which my PhD is part, to clarify the important role of participation in polis cults for a better understanding of Athenian citizenship. In the same line of thought, I suggest that the Athenian polis should be understood as a participatory society in which everybody, including people who are traditionally labelled ‘non-citizens’ or 'outsiders', held a particular position or status on account of differentiated group participation in the community. In other words, I argue that participation in polis affairs created, maintained and negotiated a sliding scale of membership of the Athenian community on which each group held a position <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>according</b> to an acknowledged status. To illustrate this I have investigated how metic status was negotiated in the context of polis religion, arguably the most important area of public polis life in which all members of the Athenian community participated in various ways. Looking at the ways in which a widely diverse amalgam of resident foreigners was incorporated as a coherent group of metics into the participatory communities of several polis festivals (i. e. the Panathenaia, the Lenaia, the City Dionysia, the Hephaisteia, the Eleusinian Mysteries, the Bendideia and several religious activities organised in the demes) and how they were differentiated and associated with the other participating groups I offer an alternative view on the status of metics as members of the Athenian community rather than as outsiders because of their exclusion from most political and juridical activities. In the end, I hope to have demonstrated 1) that polis membership largely depended on active and differentiated participation in the polis community, especially in polis religion, and should therefore be perceived as a fluid concept and 2) that metics should not be understood as 'outsiders'; instead they held their own specific polis membership on account of their participation in several important polis festivals...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{changes in}} the nature of traffic management brought about by the introduction of different technologies, mostly geographic information systems (GIS). Traffic management has changed significantly since it was born about a century ago. The invention of automatic traffic lights prompted the devaluation of action-centred skills needed to manage traffic. This process was further advanced with the introduction of geographic information systems and the consequent virtualization of the work environment. In order to analyze those transformations, the paper reviews Zuboff’s work (1988) twenty years after its publication. It argues that GIS have great potential not only to automate work activities but also to informate the organisation, providing a fresh view <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> reality. <b>According</b> to her, in order to use the information capability of GIS, the worker needs intellective skills. Besides, the organization has to provide a favourable context to explore this capability. Another consequence of the introduction of GIS is the appearance of a new form of control by surveillance: Panopticon information. Even though Zuboff’s ideas about the two faces of Information Technology and Panopticon provide an insightful framework to analyse {{changes in the}} nature of work, her assumptions about the rational use of information in the decisionmaking process may not always occur in reality. The case study at hand and research on the actual use of information in organizations contrast with Zuboff’s suggestion that IT leads to a strictly rational use of information...|$|R
