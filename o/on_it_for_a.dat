2500|$|Overall, Poor Dionis and {{all other}} prose works by Eminescu were only {{marginally}} relevant to students of Eminescu, well into the interwar period. By then, however, the story had drawn attention from the Carlo Tagliavini, who published commentary <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> Italian reading public (1923). The spread of modernist literature, and its growth into Romanian TrÄirism (a cultivation of the immediate experience), generalized interest in Eminescu's fantasy prose. Although the work had been censured by their mentor, Nae Ionescu, TrÄirists revived the Dionisian misunderstood hero; early study cases include Constantin FÃ¢ntÃ¢neru's Interior (1932). Originally impressed by Poor Dionis, Ionescu's novelist disciple, Mircea Eliade, also introduced references to the story in his 1936 novel, DomniÈoara Christina. Upon rereading the story during World War II, Eliade declared himself: [...] "less enthused than previously. In places, Eminescu's language is viscous, artificial; cacophonies abound." [...] During the same interval, the Romanian film industry, supervised by state-appointed managers Nichifor Crainic and Ion Filotti Cantacuzino, turned its attention to Eminescu's novella. Poet Dan Botta {{took it upon himself}} to write a Poor Dionis screenplay, which saw print in Familia and received good reviews. This project was ultimately cut short by the turn of tides on the Eastern Front.|$|R

Many of them were not skilled dryland farmers and failures were frequent. Much of the Plains were settled during relatively wet years. Government experts did not understand how farmers should cultivate the prairies and gave advice counter to what would have worked. Germans from Russia who had previously farmed, under similar circumstances, in what is now Ukraine were marginally more successful than other homesteaders. The Dominion Lands Act of 1871 served a similar function for establishing homesteads on the prairies in Canada.|$|E
