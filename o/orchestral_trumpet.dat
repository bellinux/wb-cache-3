50|$|The organ was {{originally}} built in 1664 by Robert Hayward, of Bath. There {{are a number}} of ranks of pipes, still functioning in the present instrument, which date from this time. Originally, the organ stood upon a screen which separated the nave from the choir. However, in 1856 the organist at that time (Mr. F. Blount) removed the instrument and resited it in the south choir aisle. J. W. Walker & Sons rebuilt and enlarged the organ in 1866 and carried out further work in 1899, when a new case to house the Choir Organ was provided. This was designed by Walter J. Fletcher, F.R.I.B.A. In 1965, a major rebuilding and re-designing of the instrument took place, the work again being undertaken by J. W. Walker & Sons. Perhaps the most striking feature of the present instrument is the <b>Orchestral</b> <b>Trumpet,</b> which is mounted horizontally above the front pipes. The current specification of the organ {{can be found on the}} National Pipe Organ Register.|$|E

5000|$|Natural {{trumpets}} {{continued to}} be used through the Classical era and even into the early Romantic period. But changing musical styles along with a growing dearth of sufficiently capable players spelled {{an end to the}} high, florid, complicated parts typical of baroque music. A few transitional composers, such as Michael Haydn, Leopold Mozart and Johann Molter wrote concerti for natural trumpets in the early Classical era. In fact, {{it could be argued that}} the concertos of Haydn and Molter represent the zenith of the natural trumpet in terms of technical demands, containing as they do some of the highest notes ever penned for the trumpet in symphonic works (in the case of Haydn, a G above high C - the 24th harmonic on a natural instrument). However, for many decades following, most <b>orchestral</b> <b>trumpet</b> writing consisted of basic harmonic support (what many trumpeters derisively refer to as [...] "thumps and bumps") and fanfare-like passages, with very little in the way of melody. There were a few notable exceptions, such as Mozart's Symphony No. 39 in E-flat major, where the trumpets intone the main theme of the opening movement, Haydn's Symphony No. 103 in E-flat major ("Drum Roll"), where the trumpets often outline the melody in all four movements, or Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 in which the trumpets double the melody of the famous [...] "Ode to Joy" [...] in the finale of the work.|$|E

40|$|François Georges Auguste Dauverné and Jean-Baptiste Laurent Arban {{represent}} {{two competing}} {{claims in the}} French trumpet tradition that militated against {{the adoption of the}} valve trumpet in the elite orchestras of Paris. These claims were manifest in their respective biography and pedagogy. Dauverné personifies the dominant conservatism that resisted valve technology in favour of the natural trumpet of the ancien régime. As the instrument was falling into disuse, Dauverné’s Méthode pour la trompette (1857) was a defence of the natural trumpet premised on its natural timbral purity, historical continuity, and elite status. It was also a lament shaped by Dauverné’s removal from performing life in the decade after 1843. Arban’s La grande méthode complète de cornet à piston et de saxhorn (1864) promoted the cornet as the heir to the <b>orchestral</b> <b>trumpet</b> based on its chromatic facility, timbral uniformity, and mass popularity. Arban’s advocacy of the instrument was also an appeal to the art music elite at the Conservatoire, for personal acceptance in fields within which he had rarely worked and with which he had only peripheral association. While the cornet was widely used in place of the valve trumpet after 1835, its timbre was questioned, and it garnered a culturally low association with popular music, and dance orchestras, alongside its military use. Arban’s career solidified the instrument’s associations outside the elite orchestra. In the 1870 s contrary to the advocacy of Dauverné and Arban, the trends they represented gave way to the historically contested, but ultimately pragmatic processes by which their students and younger colleagues embraced the modern valve trumpet. This instrument had come to broadly and satisfactorily unite the musical facility of the cornet, and the natural timbre, and historical and cultural nobility of the trumpet...|$|E
40|$|Throughout {{the history}} of Western music the trumpet has played a {{prominent}} role in every genre of music, evolving from a military signal calling natural instrument to the modem valved trumpet familiar today. For a majority of the Classical Period (ca. 1760 - 1 800), the soloistic and <b>orchestral</b> <b>trumpet's</b> role was in decline compared to the Baroque Era. The invention of the piston valve (ca. 18 15) allowed the trumpet to become fully chromatic. Because the addition of valves initially compromised the power of the natural trumpet, composers were reluctant to accept the valved trumpet and relied on the cornet a piston for chromatic passagework. For most of the 19 "' century, the trumpet was neglected as a viable instrument in chamber music. Composed over one hundred years after the invention of the valve, Francis Poulenc's (1899 - 1963) Sonata for Horn, Trumpet, and Trombone (1922), is regarded as the first true setting for trumpet in chamber music (between 1878 - 1916, approximately twenty-five works for small brass ensemble were written in St. Petersburg, Russia, not intended for chamber music per say, but still notable for the musical flexibility required by its performers). To this day, compositions for the trumpet in a chamber setting outside of the brass quintet are scarce. A brief history of the trumpet provides insight to why composers neglected the trumpet in chamber music for decades. More importantly, it raises questions regarding the responsibility for today's trumpet players to promote the creation of more chamber music through programming and collaborations with composers of this generation. Edward Tarr notes the years 1600 - 1750 as the golden age of the natural trumpet. During this period, demands upon trumpeters evolved continuously. No longer did the trumpet player's responsibilities solely consist of serving as signal caller in the military or working as a street musician. The trumpeter needed to possess skills to play soft in a chamber setting, in tune on imperfect partials, and the strength to play above the 16 '~p artial. The art of trumpet playing during this period became one the most sought after skills in society. Guilds formed to "keep the number of trumpet players small, by strict instruction and regulations and to keep it exclusive by restricting its use. " Johann Sebastian Bach's (1685 - 1750) music written for the trumpeter Gottfried Reiche (1667 - 1734) is considered the zenith of this new style clarion trumpeting. Georg Philipp Telemann's (1681 - 1767) Concerto for trumpet, 2 oboes, and continuo (1730 's), and Angelico Corelli (1653 - 1713) Sonata in D for trumpet and 2 violins, and continuo are further examples of works written for the trumpet in a chamber setting during this period...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is the {{acoustical}} characterization of some <b>orchestral</b> instruments (flute, <b>trumpet,</b> bass tuba, drums, violin, horn, piano and tenor sax) in the concert hall of the Liceo Statale “Alfano I” in Salerno, Italy. The variations in respect of time and frequency of main acoustical parameters of all orchestral instruments used, relative to the C major diatonic scale - one octave ascending and one descending-, are reported. In particular, for the temporal variations of pressure levels measured there is a comparison between the average signal unweighted (LZeq average), signal A weighted (LAeq) and unweighted signal in FAST mode (LZF). In this paper the notes played in an acoustically correct room are measured using a class A phonometer. The results provide a useful data base both for designers who deal with predictive analysis for acoustic design of concert halls and those who digitally simulate sounds produced by orchestral instruments...|$|R
5000|$|By 1733, Handel {{had spent}} {{nearly twenty years}} {{composing}} and presenting seasons of Italian opera in London. The great success of Esther the previous year had shown Handel that there was potential for further works of [...] "Sacred Drama", performed in concert form in English. Deborah reuses much music Handel had previously composed, including passages from the Brockes Passion, Il trionfo del tempo e del disinganno,the Dixit Dominus, and others.Deborah was performed as part of Handel's season at the King's Theatre in 1733, with {{the stars of the}} Italian opera singing in English, and the composer / impresario was so confident of the work's success that he doubled the price of admission for the first performance, causing some resentment and comment in the press. A feature of the work is massive choruses, some in eight parts rather than the usual four, and grandiose <b>orchestral</b> effects featuring <b>trumpets</b> and drums. One witness to the first performances noted [...] "It is very magnificent, near a hundred performers,among whom about twenty-five singers" [...] while another remarked [...] "'tis excessive noisy, a vast number of voices and instruments, who all perform at a time."Deborah achieved considerable popularity and was revived by Handel in a number of subsequent seasons.|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of the valved trumpet to the standard orchestra {{in the nineteenth century}} suggested that a period of abundance of solo literature would follow, given the new technology incorporated into the trumpet and the extra capabilities these added. Paradoxically however, the trumpet instead suffered a decline in its solo material, an observation made by musicologists such as Herbert, McGrattan, Tarr and Wallace, who all specialise {{in the history of the}} trumpet. Whilst the decline and the re-emergence of the trumpet's solo repertoire is well documented, a definitive answer as to the causes has never been established. This is the primary aim of this thesis, to explore the different reasons that may have resulted in the absence of solo literature for the trumpet, taking the 90 year period between 1860 - 1950 into consideration, covering a variety of solo literature from the time that did, or did not establish itself in the solo trumpet's repertoire. The abilities of the valved trumpet will be compared to the natural trumpet's to assess the new options provided to composers, before determining why some composers chose to adopt writing for the valved trumpet. The main activity of the valved trumpet during the studied period is within the orchestra, resulting in a number of exposed and challenging quasi-solo parts within the <b>trumpet's</b> <b>orchestral</b> repertory. To examine this, Tchaikovsky and Mahler will be the subjects of case studies as composers of key excerpts for the instrument. Their style of writing for the trumpet will be looked at to understand why the trumpet featured heavily in their orchestral works, but they did not adapt this into a solo work for the valved trumpet...|$|R
5000|$|By 1731, Handel {{had spent}} {{more than ten years}} {{composing}} Italian operas for London and presenting seasons of his operas at London theatres. There was no system of royalties or copyright at that time, and a copy of the score of Esther having been obtained, the 1720 version was performed, apparently in a staged version, by boy singers of the Chapel Royal at the Crown and Anchor tavern, a popular venue for music, and was very successful. A member of the Royal Family asked Handel to present Esther at the theatre where his operas were performed, but the Bishop of London, Edmund Gibson, would not permit Biblical stories to be acted out upon the stage. Therefore, Handel decided to present Esther in concert form as an addition to the 1732 opera season, with the singers currently appearing in the Italian operas but no scenery or stage action, and in a revised three-act form with additional text by Samuel Humphreys. The work was extremely popular and thus the form of the English oratorio was invented, almost by accident.The coronation anthems Handel had written for the coronation of George II in 1727, with their large orchestra and massed choruses, had made a huge impact, and the playbills advertising the 1732 performances of Esther said [...] "The music will be disposed after the manner of the Coronation Service". Handel's Italian operas laid overwhelming emphasis on solo arias for the star singers, with no extra choruses, while for the revision of Esther, the coronation anthems [...] "My Heart is Inditing" [...] and a version of [...] "Zadok the Priest" [...] were added. Their large choruses and grandiose <b>orchestral</b> effects with <b>trumpets</b> and drums were very different from what London audiences had experienced in Handel's Italian operas. Esther was very successful, Handel revived the work in many subsequent London seasons, and it proved the prototype for a long succession of similar dramatic oratorios in English by the composer.|$|R
