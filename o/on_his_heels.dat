25|$|Archduke Charles of Austria-Teschen, himself {{acutely aware}} of the dire {{consequences}} of the fall of Ulm, was planning to move towards Vienna, in order to reinforce the remains of the Austrian army and link up with the Russians. However, in order to avoid having Masséna's men <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>heels,</b> he decided to suddenly turn and face the French, hoping that by defeating them he would ensure the success of his march towards inner Austria.|$|E
25|$|Hot <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>heels</b> is the leprechaun Og, {{desperate to}} recover his stolen crock before he turns human. Among those {{involved}} in the ensuing shenanigans are Woody Mahoney, a ne'er-do-well dreamer who woos Sharon; his mute sister Susan, who expresses herself in dance; Woody's good friend and business partner Howard, an African-American botanist determined to grow mentholated tobacco; and bombastic Senator Billboard Rawkins, who wears his bigotry {{as if it were a}} badge of honor.|$|E
25|$|As the {{campaign}} entered week 2, it was {{anticipated that the}} Liberals would push a series of highly negative ads to combat advertising by the Conservatives that attacked Dalton McGuinty. However, instead they went positive and stayed positive throughout {{the campaign}}. It was Eves who went on the defensive as the Liberals worked the media to put the Premier <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>heels.</b> Stung by years of arrogance by the PC Party toward reporters, the media were quick to pile on.|$|E

500|$|Following {{performances}} by Marvin Gaye, Smokey Robinson, and Mary Wells, The Jacksons {{took to the}} stage for their first group performance together in eight years. The brothers sang a medley of their old hits. After they finished with [...] "I'll Be There", they left Michael alone on stage. He addressed the audience and then went into his routine. He wore black pants, leather penny loafers, a black sequined jacket, and a single white rhinestone glove. To begin his performance, Jackson snapped a fedora to his head and struck a pose—his right hand on his hat and his left leg bent. During a musical interlude, the singer executed a move that many believe to have sealed {{his status as a}} pop icon. Jackson glided backwards to perform the moonwalk, before he spun <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>heels</b> and landed en pointe. It was the first time Jackson had performed the moonwalk in public; he had practiced it in his kitchen prior to the show.|$|E
2500|$|In 210 BC, the Battle of Numistro between Marcellus and Hannibal was {{inconclusive}}, but the Romans stayed <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>heels</b> {{until the}} also inconclusive Battle of Canusium in 209 BC. In the meantime, this battle enabled another Roman army under Fabius to approach Tarentum {{and take it}} by treachery in the second Battle of Tarentum (209 BC). Hannibal, at that time, {{had been able to}} disengage from Marcellus and was only [...] away when the city, under the command of Carthalo, who was bound to Fabius by an agreement of hospitality, fell.|$|E
2500|$|He rarely showed {{emotion in}} public, and often {{appeared}} condescending to those less competent or less well-born than himself (which was nearly everyone). However, Álava was {{a witness to}} an incident just before the Battle of Salamanca. Wellington was eating a chicken leg while observing the manoeuvres of the French army through a spyglass. He spotted an overextension in the French left flank, and realised that he could launch a successful attack there. He threw the drumstick {{in the air and}} shouted [...] "Les français sont perdus!" [...] ("The French are lost!"). After the Battle of Toulouse, an aide brought him the news of Napoleon's abdication, and Wellington broke into an impromptu flamenco dance, spinning around <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>heels</b> and clicking his fingers.|$|E

2500|$|As soon as our line, set on its jolting way, emerged, I {{felt that}} two men close by had been hit, two shadows {{fell to the}} ground and rolled under our feet, one with a high-pitched scream and the other in silence like an ox. Another {{disappeared}} with a movement like a madman, {{as if he had been}} carried away. Instinctively, we closed ranks and pushed each other forward, always forward, and the wound in our midst closed itself. The warrant officer stopped and raised his sword, dropped it, fell to his knees, his kneeling body falling backwards in jerks, his helmet fell <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>heels</b> and he remained there, his head uncovered, looking up to the sky. The line has promptly split to avoid breaking this immobility. [...] But we couldn't see the lieutenant any more. No more superiors, then... A moment's hesitation held back the human wave which had reached the beginning of the plateau. The hoarse sound of air passing through our lungs could be heard over the stamping of feet. [...] Forward! cried a soldier. So we all marched forward, moving faster and faster in our race towards the abyss.|$|E
2500|$|During World War II, the French {{authorities}} in Tunisia supported the Vichy government which ruled France after its capitulation to Germany in 1940. After initial victories {{to the east}} the German General Erwin Rommel, lacking supplies and reinforcements, in 1942 lost the decisive battle of al-Alamein (near Alexandria in Egypt) to the British General Bernard Montgomery. After learning of Allied landings in the west (Operation Torch), the Axis army retreated westward to Tunisia and set up defensive positions. The British following <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>heels</b> eventually broke these lines, although Rommel did have some early success against the [...] "green" [...] American troops advancing from the west, until the arrival of General George Patton who bepp. Rommel in battle. The fighting ended in May 1943. General Eisenhower (who earned trust by talking straight if not always clearly) stated at [...] "far from governing a conquered country, we were attempting only to force a gradual widening of the base of government, with the final objective of turning all internal affairs over to popular control." [...] Tunisia became a staging area for operations in the invasion of Sicily later at year.|$|E
60|$|Hall had reappeared, {{the great}} jump accomplished, and was running shoreward. But {{there was no}} gap. Billy was <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>heels,</b> and <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>heels</b> he stayed, in to shore, down the wall, and to the mark on the beach. Billy had won by half a minute.|$|E
