5|$|The {{aspect of}} the {{colouring}} which was most unexpected was Michelangelo's treatment of shadows. The painting of the Libyan Sibyl and the Prophet Daniel, which are side-by-side, are exemplary. On the yellow dress of the Sibyl, Michelangelo has bright yellow highlights, passing through carefully graded tones of deeper yellow to pale orange, darker orange and almost to red in the shadows. While red shadows are of themselves unusual in a fresco, the gradation through adjacent parts of the spectrum is a natural enough solution. On Daniel's robes, {{there is no such}} gentle gradation. The yellow lining of his cloak becomes a sudden dense green in the shadows, while the mauve has shadows that are intensely red. These colour combinations, which are best described as iridescent, can be found at various places on the ceiling, including the hose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> in the Mathan lunette which is pale green and reddish purple.|$|E

25|$|Morton Smith {{indicates}} that in Clement's letter, the presentation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> in the linen cloth has homoerotic connotations. Following Mark 10:34, Clement {{writes in his}} letter, the story of Jesus raising the young man from the dead, who then loves Jesus and begs to stay with him. After six days, the young man comes to Jesus in the evening, clothed in nothing but a linen garment, and spends the night, during which time Jesus teaches him {{the mystery of the}} Kingdom of God.|$|E
25|$|Sonnet 110 {{is one of}} 154 sonnets {{written by}} the English playwright and poet William Shakespeare. Sonnet 110 was {{published}} {{along with the other}} sonnets in the 1609 Quarto. The sonnet falls in place with the Fair Youth sequence of Shakespeare's sonnets, in which the poet expresses his love towards a young man. The mystery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> is still unknown today. However, there are many different theories by various scholars of who this young man may be. There has been much debate whether or not this sonnet was written about Shakespeare's disdain with the stage and actors. Whereas others have interpreted sonnet 110 as the poet confessing his love to a young man.|$|E
25|$|First, there's {{the idea}} of the {{movement}} of the train, and then that of the sad young man who is in a corridor and who is moving about; thus there are two parallel movements corresponding to each other. Then, there is the distortion of the young man—I had called this elementary parallelism. It was a formal decomposition; that is, linear elements following each other like parallels and distorting the object. The object is completely stretched out, as if elastic. The lines follow each other in parallels, while changing subtly to form the movement, or the form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> in question. I also used this procedure in the Nude Descending a Staircase.|$|E

25|$|One of Caragiale's {{main and}} {{earliest}} types is that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> gripped by love, expressing himself through emphatic and Romantic clichés—its main representative is O noapte furtunoasăs Rică Venturiano. As Vianu commented, Caragiale exploited the theme {{to so much}} success that it took another generation for youthful love to be presented in a non-comedic context (with the common signature writings of Ştefan Octavian Iosif and Dimitrie Anghel). At the other end are patriarchal figures, heads of families who seem {{unable or unwilling to}} investigate their wives' adulterous relations with younger men. This behavior is notably present in O noapte furtunoasă, where the aged Dumitrache fails to note even the most obvious signs that his wife Veta is in love with his good friend Chiriac. A more complex situation is present in O scrisoare pierdută, where political boss Trahanache cannot tell that his wife Joiţica is having an affair with Tipătescu, and, when confronted with the evidence, is more interested in proving that she is not.|$|E
25|$|The {{description}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> {{with whom}} Beineman had last been seen alive was heard by a patrolman named Larry Mathewson, who believed the person described by Mrs. Goshe and {{others may be}} one John Norman Collins: a former fraternity member of his who had previously been interviewed but eliminated from police inquiries, and who he had himself seen riding his motorcycle around the Eastern Michigan University campus {{on the afternoon of}} July 23. When Mathewson questioned Collins on July 25 as to his movements two days earlier, he admitted that on the date in question he had been riding his Triumph Bonneville in the vicinity, and that he had stopped to converse with a former girlfriend of his while doing so (the point at which Mathewson had observed him). This former girlfriend was able to provide Mathewson with two recent photographs of Collins. When Mathewson showed these photographs to both Mrs. Goshe and her assistant, Patricia Spaulding, both women were adamant the man in the photographs was the same individual with whom Beineman had last been seen alive.|$|E
25|$|In early 1882, in Vienna, he {{gave the}} first {{performance}} of his Violin Concerto in D minor, playing a piano reduction of the orchestral part himself, with his teacher Benno Walter as soloist. The same year he entered Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, where he studied philosophy and art history, but not music. He left a year later to go to Berlin, where he studied briefly before securing a post as assistant conductor to Hans von Bülow, who had been enormously impressed by the young composer's Serenade for wind instruments, composed {{when he was only}} 16 years of age. Strauss learned the art of conducting by observing Bülow in rehearsal. Bülow was very fond <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man,</b> and decided that Strauss should be his successor as conductor of the Meiningen Court Orchestra when Bülow resigned in 1885. Strauss's compositions at this time were indebted to the style of Robert Schumann or Felix Mendelssohn, true to his father's teachings. His Horn Concerto No. 1, Op. 11, is representative of this period and is a staple of the modern horn repertoire.|$|E

25|$|At home, Liza {{plays the}} spinet {{as she and}} her friend Pauline sing a duet about evening in the countryside. Their girlfriends ask to hear more, so Pauline {{launches}} into a sad ballad, followed by a dancelike song. As the merriment increases, Liza remains pensively apart. A Governess chides the girls for indulging in unbecoming folk dancing and asks the visitors to leave. Pauline, the last to go, urges Liza to cheer up; Liza replies that after a storm there is a beautiful night and asks the maid, Masha, not to close the French windows to the balcony. Alone, Liza voices her unhappiness with her engagement; she has been stirred by the romantic look <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> in the park. To her shock, Herman appears on the balcony. Claiming {{he is about to}} shoot himself over her betrothal to another, he begs her to take pity on him. When the Countess is heard knocking, Liza hides Herman and opens the door to the old woman, who tells her to shut the windows and go to bed. After the Countess retires, Liza asks Herman to leave but is betrayed by her feelings and falls into his embrace.|$|E
25|$|At Florence and Halldale, two {{officers}} issued {{a plea for}} assistance in apprehending a young suspect who had thrown an object at their car and whom they were now pursuing on foot. Approximately two dozen officers, commanded by 77th Street Division LAPD officer Lieutenant Michael Moulin, arrived and arrested the youth, 16-year old Seandel Daniels, forcing him {{into the back of}} a car. The rough handling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man,</b> a minor who was well known in the community, further agitated an uneasy and growing crowd, who began taunting and berating the police. Among them was Bart Bartholemew (who was later attacked and had his driver side window broken), a freelance photographer for The New York Times, and Timothy Goldman, who began to record events with a camcorder over the next two hours. The police formed a perimeter around the arresting officers as the crowd grew more hostile, leading to further altercations and arrests (including that of Damian Williams' older brother, Mark Jackson). Fearing police would resort to deadly force to repel the growing crowd, Lieutenant Moulin ordered officers out of the area altogether. Moulin later said that officers on the scene were outnumbered and unprepared to handle the situation because their riot equipment was stored at the police academy.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that both Sonnets 46 and 47 uses the idea of a picture to describe the physical appearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man.</b> [...] Sonnet 46 states, [...] "Mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar" [...] while Sonnet 47 says, [...] "With my love's picture then my eye doth feast".|$|E

2500|$|Shakespearean scholar Joel Fineman {{offers a}} {{criticism}} of Shakespeare's sonnets in a broader context that is evident in Sonnet 53. Fineman writes, [...] "from Aristotle on the conventional understanding of rhetoric of praise as all the rhetoricians uniformly say, energetically, 'heightens its effect," [...] (Fineman). [...] In this sense, the praise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> is meant to highlight his features {{and bring them to}} a literal understanding.|$|E
2500|$|Until recently, {{the opinion}} {{has been very}} common that the raising <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man,</b> portrayed in Secret Mark, has {{primarily}} a baptismal significance, {{as a sort of}} a 'baptism of initiation.' This was the opinion that Smith himself originally proposed. Along these lines, the statement [...] "Jesus taught him the mystery of the kingdom of God" [...] was typically read as a reference to the rites of baptism.|$|E
