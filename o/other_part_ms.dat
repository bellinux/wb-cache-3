40|$|We {{present a}} study of HII regions in M 51 using the Hubble Space Telescope ACS images taken {{as part of the}} Hubble Heritage Program. We have catalogued about 19, 600 HII regions in M 51 with Ha {{luminosity}} in the range of L = 10 ^ 35. 5 erg/s to 10 ^ 39. 0 erg/s. The Ha luminosity function of HII regions (HII LF) in M 51 is well represented by a double power law with its index alpha=- 2. 25 ± 0. 02 for the bright part and alpha=- 1. 42 ± 0. 01 for the faint part, separated at a break point L= 10 ^ 37. 1 erg/s. This break was not found in previous studies of M 51 HII regions. Comparison with simulated HII LFs suggests that this break is caused by the transition of HII region ionizing sources, from low mass clusters (with 10 ^ 3 M_sun, including several OB stars) to more massive clusters (including several tens of OB stars). The HII LFs with L < 10 ^ 37. 1 erg/s are found to have different slopes for different <b>parts</b> in <b>M</b> 51 : the HII LF for the interarm region is steeper than those for the arm and the nuclear regions. This observed difference in HII LFs can be explained by evolutionary effects that HII regions in the interarm region are relatively older than those in the <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> of <b>M</b> 51.

40|$|Some of {{the variety}} of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus dysgalactiae ssp. equisimilis (SDSE) M {{proteins}} act as collagen-binding adhesins that facilitate acute infection. Moreover, their potential to trigger collagen autoimmunity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute rheumatic fever and attributed to a collagen-binding motif called PARF (peptide associated with rheumatic fever). For the first time we determine the rate of clinical isolates with collagen-binding M proteins that use a PARF motif (A/T/E) XYLXX(L/F) N in a defined geographic region, Vellore in South India. In this region both, incidence of streptococcal infections and prevalence of acute rheumatic fever are high. M proteins with PARF motif conferred collagen-binding activity to 3. 9 % of 153 S. pyogenes and 10. 6 % of 255 SDSE clinical isolates from Vellore. The PARF motif occurred in three S. pyogenes and 22 SDSE M protein types. In one of the S. pyogenes and five of the SDSE M proteins that contained the motif, collagen-binding was impaired, due to influences of <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> of the <b>M</b> protein molecule. The accumulated data on the collagen binding activity of certain M protein types allowed a reanalysis of published worldwide emm-typing data with the aim to estimate the rates of isolates that bind collagen via PARF. The results indicate that M proteins, which bind collagen via a PARF motif, are epidemiologically relevant in human infections, not only in Vellore. It is imperative to include the most relevant collagen-binding M types in vaccines. But when designing M protein based vaccine...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} the {{mechanical}} {{properties of the}} wear parts {{with respect to the}} different heat treatments applied have been investigated. Two different alloys and a total of nine different heat treatment procedures were tested. Alloy 35 M 13 B have been tested with respect to tempering temperature and represents one wear <b>part.</b> The <b>other</b> wear <b>part</b> 30 <b>M</b> 12 CB have been tested with respect to both tempering temperatures and effect of direct hardening. The main goal of this work has been to improve the understanding of how the steel alloys used for the wear parts responds to different tempering temperatures and heat treatments. During this work both alloys were tested using the following test methods; charpy impact testing, tensile testing and Vickers hardness testing. From production, wear <b>part</b> 30 <b>M</b> 12 CB as currently produced and when directly hardened was to be investigated for its mechanical properties, thus alloy 30 M 12 CB was heat treated at different temperatures with the aim to find two heat treatments that would match the wear parts pulled from production. The two chosen temperatures for 30 M 12 CB were 850 *C representing the current production and 1100 *C representing direct hardening. Then, wear <b>parts</b> 30 <b>M</b> 12 CB and 35 M 13 B was heat treated accordingly and tempered. The current tempering temperature of 220 *C was compared with 180 *C and no tempering. Charpy test specimens and tensile test specimens for 35 M 13 B and 30 M 12 CB were then tested with three parallels. The results recorded was then compared with respect to mechanical properties for the different tempering temperatures and heat treatments. For all parts the strength increased slightly by lowering tempering temperature from 220 *C to 180 *C. No tempering did not affect the ductility of 35 M 13 B and improved the strength and hardness for this alloy, in contrast no tempering left 30 M 12 CB- 850 very brittle. Directly hardening wear <b>part</b> 30 <b>M</b> 12 CB will result in a slight reduction in quality, however the difference in quality will likely be slightly greater than the results from this work indicates. It is reasonable to say that reducing the temperature of tempering for 35 M 13 B may be preferable as it saves space, reduces production time and cost, while maintaining or increasing the hardness and strength of the material. Further, the slight reduction in ductility should not lead to brittle fractures and thus may not affect the end product negatively...|$|R
