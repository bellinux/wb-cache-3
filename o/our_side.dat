25|$|Me & Charles were at {{war from}} 1979 until 1999. He even {{threatened}} having bouncers {{on the doors}} of Medway Poet’s readings to keep me out. There were two camps in the Medway Poets from day one - me & Sexton versus everyone else. Bill came down on <b>our</b> <b>side</b> in the end. Rob Earl would have been with me & Sexton, but he wasn’t on the scene so much.|$|E

25|$|As the Earl of Listowel, {{speaking}} in the House of Lords on 28 November 1933, stated, ‘‘the Assyrians fought on <b>our</b> <b>side</b> during the war,’’ and made ‘‘enormous sacrifices,’’ having ‘‘lost altogether {{by the end of}} the War about two-thirds of their total number.’'.... About half of the Assyrian nation died of murder, disease, or exposure as refugees during the war, according to the head of the Anglican Church, which had a mission to the Assyrians.|$|E
25|$|The theory {{contains}} only one half {{the explanation of}} man's origins and needs spiritualism to carry it through and complete it. For while this ascent on the physical side has been progressing through myriads of ages, the Divine descent has also been going on – man being spiritually an incarnation from the Divine {{as well as a}} human development from the animal creation. The cause of the development is spiritual. Mr. Darwin's theory does not in the least militate against ours – we think it necessitates it; he simply does not deal with <b>our</b> <b>side</b> of the subject. He can not go lower than the dust of the earth for the matter of life; and for us, the main interest of our origin must lie in the spiritual domain.|$|E
500|$|Speaking in retrospect, Gheorghiu-Dej {{indicated}} the actual relation between his party and Tătărescu's: [...] "we {{have had to}} tolerate by <b>our</b> <b>side</b> a capitalist-gentry political group, Tătărescu's group".|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{there is}} one thing to be thankful for," [...] said Dick, as they rested from their labors. [...] "That trunk might have gone through <b>our</b> <b>sides</b> or bottom and sunk us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{like these}} lulls," [...] said Captain Roy to the hermit, {{as they stood}} close to the binnacle, in the feeble light of its lamp. [...] "What is that {{striking}} against <b>our</b> <b>sides,</b> Mr Moor?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{happened}} at Schloss P-mp-rn-ckel, [...] A strange mishap <b>our</b> <b>sides</b> to tickle, [...] And set {{the people in}} a roar;-- [...] A strange caprice of Fortune fickle: [...] I never thought at Pumpernickel [...] To see a SPECK UPON THE FLOOR!" ...|$|R
500|$|Our strategy, as usual, was {{to force}} the U.S. {{government}} to intervene in case there were arrests—and {{if they did not}} intervene, that inaction would once again prove the government was not on <b>our</b> <b>side</b> and thus intensify the development of a mass consciousness among blacks. Our slogan for this drive was [...] "One Man, One Vote." ...|$|E
500|$|Lord Cantelupe {{wrote in}} his diary that [...] "the number of killed & wounded on <b>our</b> <b>side</b> amount to one hundred & twenty, one officer killed. Cantelupe's figure agrees {{approximately}} with Howe's official casualty return for “the different skirmishes from 4thto 8thDecember”, which gives 19 killed, 60 wounded and 33 missing. David Martin gives the total British loss, including deserters, as 350, which would suggest that 238 men deserted.|$|E
500|$|Aviator Charles Lindbergh is {{less well}} known in the {{parallel}} universe, and the famous kidnapping of his son presumably did not occur, as Fauxlivia expresses confusion when his name is brought up. When Walter, Bell, and Olivia are on the Other Side eating at KFC (called KGC in the alternate universe, for Kentucky Grilled Chicken), Walter puts on a Brooklyn Dodgers baseball cap. Unlike in <b>Our</b> <b>Side,</b> the team never moved to Los Angeles. The parallel universe has a number of famous comic book issues from DC Comics, similar to <b>Our</b> <b>Side,</b> but with notable differences. For instance, the Red Arrow and Red Lantern exist on the Other Side, rather than the green versions of both characters in our universe, and there are different members in the Justice League. Fauxlivia's cellphone ringtone is taken from the 1975 film The Rocky Horror Picture Show. [...] Other films, both real and invented, are also shown in the parallel universe, such as Superman vs. Batman 2, Indiana Jones and the Hex of the Hydra, Star Wars: Legion of Droids, Splash 7, Smokey and the Bandit: The Final Lap and Mask vs. Joker.|$|E

500|$|The {{dialogue}} that the Beast says while {{negotiating with the}} Axe Gang for killing the Landlady and Landlord – [...] "...then young friend, I will make an offer you cannot refuse", is a reference of the dialogue from the movie The Godfather. Also, the Landlady's comment to Brother Sum – [...] "We brought a gift you cannot refuse" [...] is an obvious parody of the same, to which Sum replies (in the dubbed version of the film), [...] "Ha! With the Beast on <b>our</b> <b>side,</b> we shall see for whom the bell tolls", {{a reference to the}} 1943 film.|$|E
500|$|Kinsler was {{mentioned}} as an MVP candidate before his injury by writers at ESPN, the Dallas News, the Los Angeles Times, and the Washington Post. He could have conceivably rivaled Pedroia for MVP, {{if not for}} the sports hernia that cut his 2008 campaign short a month and a half. [...] "I think he just missed having an MVP year", manager Ron Washington said. [...] "If luck [...] on <b>our</b> <b>side</b> and he [...] healthy, he would have run away with it." [...] In the end, he received a single 10th-place vote from Jeff Wilson of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.|$|E
500|$|... 3 September 1917: [...] "With {{reference}} to a suggestion that the matter might be postponed, [...] pointed out {{that this was a}} question on which the Foreign Office had been very strongly pressed for a long time past. There was a very strong and enthusiastic organisation, more particularly in the United States, who were zealous in this matter, and his belief was that it would be of most substantial assistance to the Allies to have the earnestness and enthusiasm of these people enlisted on <b>our</b> <b>side.</b> To do nothing was to risk a direct breach with them, and it was necessary to face this situation." ...|$|E

60|$|At least, I did {{not want}} in confidence; and when I next rushed Solan it was to one side with {{implicit}} confidence that he must turn to meet my new line of attack, and turn he did, so that now we fought with <b>our</b> <b>sides</b> towards the coveted goal--the great switch stood within my reach upon my right hand.|$|R
60|$|Some one of {{the party}} brought strips of rawhide, by which our hands and arms were bound tightly to <b>our</b> <b>sides,</b> and with so large a {{surrounding}} {{that it would have}} been impossible to escape even had we been unfettered, they led us down to the village, where we were greeted by the squaws and the children with fiendish cries of delight.|$|R
500|$|Lord Hawke, {{writing a}} {{foreword}} to {{his history of}} Yorkshire, referred to Pullin as the non-playing member of the county team: [...] "His criticisms on <b>our</b> <b>side</b> form an invaluable guide to the captain, his enthusiasm is contagious, but never allows his judgement to become unbalanced, whilst his eloquent writings on cricket have gone to {{every part of the}} world in which there are lovers of the game... I feel bound to say to the esteemed author of this book—'Well done, thou faithful friend. Hawke later said that Pullin's judgement of young cricketers was very good, and that [...] "through his writing he did much to assist the Yorkshire club in encouraging the game and its players".|$|E
500|$|On 18 November 1956, while {{addressing}} Western ambassadors at {{a reception}} at the Polish embassy in Moscow, Khrushchev used his famous [...] "Whether {{you like it or}} not, history is on <b>our</b> <b>side.</b> We will bury you" [...] expression, shocking everyone present. He later claimed that he had not been talking about nuclear war, but rather about the historically determined victory of communism over capitalism. In 1961, Khrushchev declared that even if the USSR was behind the West, within a decade its housing shortage would disappear, consumer goods would be abundant, and within two decades, the [...] "construction of a communist society" [...] in the USSR would be completed [...] "in the main".|$|E
500|$|On March 24, 2009, it was {{reported}} that Bosh's former girlfriend, Allison Mathis, was seeking child support and sole custody of their daughter, Trinity (born November 2, 2008). Mathis alleged that when she was seven months pregnant, Bosh stopped supporting her financially and tried to remove her from their home. Three days later, it {{was reported}} that the dispute was only over the amount Bosh paid. Mathis' lawyer also told the press, [...] "My client very much wanted this dispute to remain private. Certainly this thing did not get started by anything on <b>our</b> <b>side...</b> She is very distressed that somehow this thing got into the newspapers. She wants Trinity to have a good relationship with her dad, Chris Bosh, and adverse publicity makes that more difficult." ...|$|E
60|$|War, war! It {{is terrible}} certainly. But {{there are worse}} plagues, deeper griefs, dreader wounds than the physical. What of the forty {{thousand}} wretched women in this city? The silent writhing of them is to me more appalling than {{the roar of the}} cannons. Then this war is necessary on <b>our</b> <b>sides.</b> Is that wrong necessary? It is not so clear to me.|$|R

6000|$|... "None of {{them are}} {{anything}} like as high {{out of the water}} as the Bonito," [...] the captain said, [...] "and they will find it very difficult to climb up <b>our</b> <b>sides.</b> Still the odds against us are serious, but we shall give them a warmer reception than they expect. They will hardly calculate either on our being so strong handed, or so well prepared for them." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Bloodline" [...] has {{received}} generally mixed to positive reviews from television critics. Sarah Stegall enjoyed it, commenting that [...] "This {{was one of}} the more quietly brilliant episodes of Fringe to date. Reaching {{all the way back to}} the first season for its genesis, it was still firmly rooted in the most up-to-date events, tied together several characters in a cabal of resistance, paved the way for major drama down the way, and gave us some emotional highlights we cannot expect to see from <b>Our</b> <b>Side</b> characters." [...] Entertainment Weekly staff writer Ken Tucker called the episode [...] "a beautifully modulated hour, written by Alison Schapker and Monica Owusu-Breen, that took care to establish the anxiety felt by Altivia and her mother, Marilyn (Amy Madigan) about the pregnancy." ...|$|E
500|$|Finally, on 14 December 1976, British Foreign Minister Anthony Crosland {{announced}} that the conference was to be adjourned. It was never reconvened—the Patriotic Front now {{said that it would}} not return to Geneva or take part in any further talks unless immediate black rule was made the only subject for discussion. Apparently believing that the British and Rhodesians were secretly working together to prevent this, Nkomo laid down pre-conditions for any new conference. [...] "The Rhodesian situation is a war situation... On <b>our</b> <b>side</b> it is the Patriotic Front, and on the British... side it is the British government with the Rhodesian régime as [...] extension.... The agenda must have only one item... the transfer of power from the minority to the majority. This means a constitution based on universal adult suffrage.... This item should take four to five days." ...|$|E
500|$|British war {{correspondent}} Philip Gibbs noted Amiens' {{effect on}} the war's tempo, saying on 27 August that, [...] "the enemy...is on the defensive" [...] and, [...] "the initiative of attack is so completely in our hands {{that we are able}} to strike him at many different places." [...] Gibbs also credits Amiens with a shift in troop morale, saying, [...] "the change has been greater in the minds of men than in the taking of territory. On <b>our</b> <b>side</b> the army seems to be buoyed up with the enormous hope of getting on with this business quickly" [...] and that, [...] "there is a change also in the enemy's mind. They no longer have even a dim hope of victory on this western front. All they hope for now is to defend themselves long enough to gain peace by negotiation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now, {{did anyone}} ever before read such {{a mixture of}} the bombastic and the burlesque? We {{are called upon to}} cry over every joke, and, for the life of us, we cannot hold <b>our</b> <b>sides</b> when the catastrophes occur. It is a salad in which the pungency of the vinegar has been wholly subdued by the oil, and the fatness of the oil {{destroyed}} by the tartness of the vinegar.' ...|$|R
60|$|M. Mol. Our armours now may rust; our idle scymiters Hang by <b>our</b> <b>sides</b> for ornament, not use: Children shall beat our atabals and drums, And all {{the noisy}} trades of war no more Shall wake the {{peaceful}} morn; the Xeriff's blood No longer in divided channels runs, The younger house took end in Mahomet: Nor shall Sebastian's formidable name Be longer used to lull the crying babe.|$|R
50|$|The {{explanation}} for self-tickling is still unknown, however {{research shows that}} the human brain is trained to know what to feel when a person moves or performs any action. Human inability of being aware of many sensations from self movements and actions, such as not paying attention to our vocal cords is considered another reason for our inability of self-tickling. If we try to tickle ourselves by grabbing <b>our</b> <b>sides,</b> <b>our</b> brain foresees this contact of our body with hand and prepares itself for it. This removes the feeling of unease and panic, thus the body will not react to tickling as it would if someone else were to tickle us.|$|R
