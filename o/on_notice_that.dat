At WrestleMania 22, he interrupted a Randy Orton interview, putting SmackDown! <b>on</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> the World Heavyweight Championship would return to him by WrestleMania 23. Batista made his official return during July 7 episode of SmackDown! immediately calling out and entering into a feud with Mark Henry. At Saturday Night's Main Event, Batista won a six-man tag match with Rey Mysterio and Bobby Lashley taking on King Booker, Finlay, and Mark Henry. Henry was legitimately injured and was ruled out of the scheduled match between the two at The Great American Bash, thus further delaying a potential feud between the two after being delayed by Batista's initial injury.|$|E
25|$|On April 17, 2009, the Rams offered Incognito {{a one-year}} tender worth $1.01 million, which he signed on May 3. Incognito started all nine {{games in which}} he played for the Rams in 2009. On December 13, {{during the first half}} of a 47–7 loss to the Tennessee Titans, Incognito drew two 15-yard {{penalties}} for headbutting Titans players. Head coach Steve Spagnuolo benched him for the second half, and the two got into a heated confrontation on the sidelines. It was the second time Incognito had been benched for losing his composure; he had been pulled from the season opener against Seattle for two personal fouls. However, the Titans incident was the last straw; the Rams waived him two days after the game. In 2013, former Rams general manager Billy Devaney told ESPN that Spagnuolo had given Incognito numerous chances to clean up his act, and had put him <b>on</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> the Rams would cut ties with him if he couldn't control his anger.|$|E

500|$|A {{key figure}} {{in the end of}} the blacklisting of McCarthyism was John Henry Faulk. Host of an {{afternoon}} comedy radio show, Faulk was a leftist active in his union, the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. He was scrutinized by AWARE, Inc., one of the private firms that examined individuals for signs of communist [...] "disloyalty". Marked by AWARE as unfit, he was fired by CBS Radio. Almost uniquely among the many victims of blacklisting, Faulk decided to sue AWARE in 1957 and finally won the case in 1962. With this court decision, the private blacklisters and those who used them were put <b>on</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> they were legally liable for the professional and financial damage they caused. Although some informal blacklisting continued, the private [...] "loyalty checking" [...] agencies were soon a thing of the past.

500|$|Through December, Foraker {{worked to}} try to retain his Senate seat, which {{required}} action by the Ohio legislature in the era before direct election of senators. [...] His rivals were Burton and the President-elect's brother, former congressman Charles Phelps Taft, though {{near the end of}} the contest, former lieutenant governor Warren G. Harding asked for his name to be considered. Both Foraker and Burton opposed Charles Taft's call for a caucus of the Republican legislators to determine the party's candidate. On December 29, President Roosevelt weighed in on the question. Roosevelt [...] "lost no time in putting the Republican members of the Ohio legislature <b>on</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> to re-elect Mr. Foraker to the Senate would be regarded as nothing less than treason to the party". [...] Roosevelt accused Foraker of seeking to make a bargain with the Democrats to secure his re-election in exchange for a Democratic replacement for Dick in 1911. Faced with this presidential intervention and Charles Taft's withdrawal from the race, Foraker saw no path to victory and conceded on December 31. [...] The Republican caucus two days later selected Burton, whom the legislators duly selected on January 12.|$|E

2500|$|More recently, {{scholars}} {{have questioned the}} perception of Thucydides as simply [...] "the father of realpolitik". Instead they have brought to the fore the literary qualities of the History, which they see as belonging to the narrative tradition of Homer and Hesiod and as concerned with the concepts of justice and suffering found in Plato and Aristotle and problematized in Aeschylus and Sophocles. Richard Ned Lebow terms Thucydides [...] "the last of the tragedians", stating that [...] "Thucydides drew heavily on epic poetry and tragedy to construct his history, which not surprisingly is also constructed as a narrative." [...] In this view, the blind and immoderate behaviour of the Athenians (and indeed {{of all the other}} actors) – though perhaps intrinsic to human nature – ultimately leads to their downfall. Thus his History could serve as a warning to future leaders to be more prudent, by putting them <b>on</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> someone would be scrutinizing their actions with a historian's objectivity rather than a chronicler's flattery.|$|E
2500|$|The Alabama prison guards' {{use of the}} {{hitching}} post was [...] "arguably" [...] such an [...] "obvious" [...] {{violation of}} Hope's Eighth Amendment rights that the Court's prior cases put the guards <b>on</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> using the hitching post would violate the Eighth Amendment. [...] Indeed, the U.S. Department of Justice had so advised the Alabama Department of Corrections. [...] Furthermore, Fifth Circuit precedent that was binding {{on the state of}} Alabamaforbidding [...] "handcuffing inmates to the fence and to cells for long periods of time, and forcing inmates to stand, sit, or lie on crates, stumps, or otherwise maintain awkward positions for prolonged periods"should have notified the guards that using the hitching post violated the Eighth Amendment. [...] Finally, an Alabama Department of Corrections regulation required guards to maintain a log of the inmate's needs for water and bathroom breaks while tied to the hitching post, and required the guards to release the inmate if he told them he was ready to return to work. [...] However, evidence in this case showed that the guards did not maintain such a log during the June incident, and evidence in a related case showed that Alabama prison guards routinely disregarded the regulation's recordkeeping requirement and release conditions. [...] "A course of conduct that tends to prove that the requirement was merely a sham, or that respondents could ignore it with impunity, provides equally strong support for the conclusion that they were fully aware of the wrongful character of their conduct." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{light of}} these deficiencies, Thomas {{concluded}} that it was [...] "far from obvious" [...] that the actions of these three guards violated the Eighth Amendment. [...] The question Thomas asked was whether in 1995 {{it was obvious that}} the [...] "mere act of cuffing petitioner to the restraining bar... violated the Eighth Amendment." [...] In Thomas's view, no prior litigation involving Alabama's use of the restraining bar would have put a reasonable prison guard <b>on</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> the mere act of attaching a prisoner to it would violate the Eighth Amendment. [...] The three federal district courts in Alabama had all rejected this contention, as well as the idea endorsed by the majoritythat exposure to the elements resulting from an extended stay on the hitching post, coupled with the pain caused by the handcuffedwas the wanton and unnecessary infliction of pain. [...] Hope did not allege that the mere act of attaching him to the restraining bar [...] "imposed a substantial risk of serious harm upon him". [...] Nor was it, in light of the district courts' conclusion, [...] "obvious" [...] that this act would have caused Hope harm. [...] There was no evidence that these particular guards had read the Department of Justice's report. [...] The Alabama Department of Corrections's regulation specifically authorized guards to use the restraining bar when inmates were disruptive to the work squad. [...] The fact that the guards did not comply with the recordkeeping requirement of the regulation was beside the point, Justice Thomas believed, because Hope never alleged that the guards' failure to do so caused the Eighth Amendment violation. [...] Thomas also read binding Fifth and Eleventh Circuit precedent merely to prohibit [...] "malicious and sadistic" [...] conduct by guards. [...] While handcuffing prisoners to fences for [...] "long periods of time" [...] could be considered malicious and sadistic under these binding precedents, it was not clear to Justice Thomas whether 7 hours counted as a [...] "long period of time" [...] under this precedent. [...] Finally, [...] "deliberate indifference" [...] means that the prison official knew of and then disregarded an excessive risk to health and safety, and {{there was no evidence that}} these guards knew that merely attaching Hope to the restraining bar posed such a risk.|$|E
