5|$|After the Southwest {{became part}} of the U.S., explorers {{continued}} to look for good east–west routes along the 35thparallel. In 1853, a crew led by U.S. Army Lieutenant Amiel Whipple surveyed along a sandy wash {{in the northern part of}} the Petrified Forest. So impressed was Whipple by the petrified wood along the banks of the arroyo that he named it Lithodendron Creek (Stone Tree Creek). Geologist Jules Marcou, a member of the Whipple expedition, <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> petrified trees were from the Triassic.|$|E

5|$|By 1854, Hindman {{realized}} that he had little room to maneuver in the crowded Mississippi political arena. Looking across the Mississippi River, Hindman <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> young and turbulent state of Arkansas was wide open for a well-educated and ambitious politician. Hindman left Mississippi politics when he moved to Helena, Arkansas on March 18, 1854.|$|E
5|$|David Darts {{discussed}} Not in Front of the Children in {{an article}} for Studies in Art Education, and wrote that queries over artistic value as balanced against a desire to protect attendees of educational institutions from perceived harm repeatedly came up over {{time in the history}} of censorship. He <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rationale for justifying censorship of artwork from children was based upon similar reasons dating back from Plato to contemporary times, namely anxiety that youth would become corrupted by viewing products deemed inappropriate.|$|E
5|$|During the 1660s, Giovanni Cassini used a new {{telescope}} to discover spots and colorful bands on Jupiter and <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> planet appeared oblate; that is, flattened at the poles. He was {{also able to}} estimate the rotation period of the planet. In 1690 Cassini noticed that the atmosphere undergoes differential rotation.|$|E

5|$|Faith et al. 2013 further {{suggested}} that the bluebuck, being a grazer, probably favoured grassland habitats. This hypothesis is supported by fossil evidencebluebuck fossils appear in significant numbers {{along with those of}} grassland antelopes. Kerley et al. 2009 {{suggested that}} the bluebuck frequented grasslands and shunned wooded areas and thickets. In a 1976 study of fossils in the Southern Cape, Klein <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bluebuck's habitat preferences were {{similar to those of the}} Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer) and the reedbuck (Redunca).|$|E
5|$|In 1666, Newton <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{spectrum}} of colours exiting a prism {{in the position}} of minimum deviation is oblong, even when the light ray entering the prism is circular, which is to say, the prism refracts different colours by different angles. This led him to conclude that colour is a property intrinsic to light—a point which had been debated in prior years.|$|E
5|$|In 2010 a new fish counter was {{commissioned}} for the Shimna {{river and the}} initial results indicated that fish numbers had reached approximately 76% of the conservation limit (the number of fish required to spawn) in the 2010 season. This is an improvement from the estimated 12% in 2009. However, in 2014 concerns about salmon levels in the river were raised again after it was <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> number of eggs being laid was still below conservation limits.|$|E

5|$|In the aftermath, the North Vietnamese proclaimed {{a victory}} at Khe Sanh, while US forces {{claimed that they}} had {{withdrawn}} as the base was no longer required. Historians have <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Khe Sanh may have distracted American and South Vietnamese attention from the buildup of Viet Cong forces in the south before the early 1968 Tet Offensive. Nevertheless, the US commander during the battle, General William Westmoreland, maintained that the true intention of Tet was to distract forces from Khe Sanh.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} first {{millennium}} BC, Babylonian astronomers <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Sun's motion along the ecliptic is not uniform, {{though they did}} not know why; it is today known that {{this is due to the}} movement of Earth in an elliptic orbit around the Sun, with Earth moving faster when it is nearer to the Sun at perihelion and moving slower when it is farther away at aphelion.|$|E
5|$|On January 7, 1610, Galileo wrote {{a letter}} {{containing}} the first mention of Jupiter's moons. At the time, he saw only three of them, and he believed them to be fixed stars near Jupiter. He continued to observe these celestial orbs from January 8 to March 2, 1610. In these observations, he discovered a fourth body, and also <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> four were not fixed stars, but rather were orbiting Jupiter.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} month, Frail <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{luminosity}} {{of the radio}} source fluctuated significantly {{from day to day}} but increased on average. The fluctuations did not occur simultaneously along all of the observed wavelengths, which Jeremy Goodman of Princeton University explained as being the result of the radio waves being bent by interstellar plasma in the Milky Way. Such radio scintillations (rapid variations in the radio luminosity of an object) occur only when the source has an apparent diameter of less than 3microarcseconds.|$|E

5|$|The {{architecture}} of the tomb is praised and also derided; it is derided {{for the lack of}} proportioning of its various units and use of poor material for construction. Reginald Heber, who was Bishop of Calcutta between 1823 and 1826, based on the light brown colour of the stone used, had <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tomb has the “colour of potted meat”. Even ASI has <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> marble used for ornamentation in the towers though pleasing is “rather florid”. Another observation is that the tomb can not be compared to the Taj Mahal or the Humayun Tomb, as, {{at the time it was}} built, the Mughal Empire was on the decline and sandstone had to be used and lines were set improperly and the quality appeared “thread bare”.|$|E
