40|$|One way to {{allocate}} tasks to agents is by ascribing them obligations. From obligations to be, agents are able to infer what are the forbidden, permitted and <b>obligatory</b> <b>actions</b> they may perform, by using the well-known Meyer’s reduction from obligations to be to obligations to do. However, we show through an example that this method is not completely adequate to guide agents’ decisions. We then propose a solution using, instead of obligations, the concept of ‘responsibility’. To formalise responsibility we use a multiagent extension of propositional dynamic logic as framework, and then we define some basic concepts, such as ‘agent ability’, also briefly discussing the problem of uniform strategies and a possible solution.

40|$|Abstract Traditional {{security}} policies largely {{focus on}} access control. Though essential, access control {{is only one}} aspect of security. In particular, the correct behavior and reliable operation of a system depends not only on what users are permitted to do, but oftentimes on what users are required to do. Such <b>obligatory</b> <b>actions</b> are integral to the security procedures of many enterprises. Unlike access control, obligations assigned to individual users are often unenforceable, that is, the system cannot ensure that each obligation will be fulfilled. Accurately determining who was at fault when obligations are not met is essential for responding appropriately, be it in terms of modified trust relationships or other recourse. In this paper, based on a formal metamodel of obligations, we propose an approach for fault assessment through active online tracking of responsibilities and dependencies between obligations. We identify and formalize two key properties for the correct assessment of fault, and design responsibility assignment and fault assessment algorithms for a concrete yet general access control and obligation system. ...|$|R

40|$|Some {{people do}} {{far more than}} {{morality}} requires: consider the doctor who travels to a remote or dangerous area to treat the sick. I offer an account of what these “moral saints” look like and argue that their behavior influences the moral obligations faced {{by the rest of}} us. According to Susan Wolf’s prominent account, moral saints are necessarily unattractive—dull-witted, bland, obsessive—and thus unworthy as personal ideals. I argue that this view renders saints self-defeating and relies on an unfounded moralization of nonmoral character traits. I then show that a distinction between two types of moral motivation bears on whether moral saints appear unattractive. An agent can be motivated directly by the features that make an act morally right (rightness de re), or instead by some abstract notion of “morality” itself (rightness de dicto). Moral saints appear unattractive only when we make the mistake of assuming they must be motivated by the abstract notion {{at the expense of the}} right-making features. I then argue that moral saints ratchet-up our moral obligations by providing the rest of us with a crucial sort of evidence about what it is like to perform morally extraordinary actions, and by extension <b>obligatory</b> <b>actions.</b> Moral obligation is at its core a matter of what we can reasonably demand of one another. One cannot be obligated to perform an action that it would be reasonable to believe is an unbearable sacrifice. Moral saints generate evidence about how much sacrifice is involved in performing actions at the boundaries of obligation. I argue that in the context of moral obligation, a “sacrifice” is a gross loss of well-being, defined agent-neutrally. As our stock of evidence expands, justified ignorance is reduced, thus removing a defeater of obligations. In seeing that actions with a high degree of sacrifice are not unbearably burdensome, we infer that actions with significantly lower degrees of sacrifice are even less burdensome.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} how the medical performance of physicians during consultations is related to doctor-patient communication and satisfaction of patients, taking into account the actual length of the consultations. In addition, we studied the validity of the 'efficiency-per-time score' as a measure of competence. METHODS: General practice trainees participated in a test situation in which they were confronted with six consultations with standardized (simulated) patients (SPs). All consultations were videotaped and evaluated by multiple observers, using national guidelines on medical content and on communication. The SPs scored satisfaction with the consultation using a satisfaction checklist. Forty GP-trainees were invited, of whom 34 participated. The main outcome measures were the number of <b>obligatory</b> <b>actions</b> undertaken by the GP-trainees, total number of actions undertaken, consultation time, efficiency-per-time score, patient satisfaction and quality of communication score, and the Pearson correlations between these measures. RESULTS: There was a negative correlation between the 'efficiency-per-time score' of the GP-trainees and the satisfaction of the SPs in five of the six consultations [Pearson r from - 0. 29 (P < 0. 05) to - 0. 58 (P < 0. 001) ] and between the 'efficiency-per-time score' and the quality of the communication in three of the six consultations [Pearson r from - 0. 34 (P <. 05) to - 0. 51 (P < 0. 001) ].

Shankara (788 - 820), whose philosophical system is called kevalâdvaita (unique/perfect non-dualism [monism]) ou shuddhâdvaita (inqualified nondualism), has taken moral life as an essential requisite to metaphysical knowledge, necessary to reaching the ultimate objective of life: knowledge of the essential identity between the “I”(âtman) and the Supreme Being (Brahman). In his Viveka-Chûdâmani (“The Supreme Jewel of Discernment”), as well as in other vedantic writings, Brahman is called Sat-ChitÂnanda (Being-Conscience-Blessedness), and G. Dandoy makes the following analogy between this conception and images of God in Saint Augustine (De Civitate Dei, VIII, 10) : Sat - “causa constituta universitatis”; Chit - “lux percipiendæ veritatis”; Ânanda - “fons bibendæ felicitatis” (G. Dandoy, L’Ontologie du Vedanta, 1932 : 33). We analize the way how these characteristics of the divine nature, that can be attained solely by those men that have reached the stage of jîvanmukti (“liberation in life”), can motivate men to reach the Divine, mirroring themselves in His/Her characteristics while trecking the trail of viveka (discerniment), and practicing as pre-requisites the <b>obligatory</b> <b>actions</b> of yama (“moral discipline”, consisting in Ahimsâ [“non-violence”], Satyâ [“truthfulness”], Asteyâ [“notrobbing”], Brahmacaryâ [“chastity” or “non-vicious sexuality”], Aparigrahâ [“non-envy”]) and niyama (“self-control”, consisting in Shachka [“cleanliness” or “purity”], Samtosha [“content”], Tapas [“austerity” or “askesis”], Svâdhyâya [“study”], and Îshvara-pranidhâna [“devotion to the Supreme Being”]).

40|$|Concerning the {{prohibited}} or <b>obligatory</b> <b>actions</b> for perpetrating or abandoning {{of which}} no punishment has been established, {{the act of}} determining discretionary punishment is entrusted to the Muslim judge. An important and meaningful question is raised here as to whether this kind of punishment would include all the unlawful actions and abandoning? In other words, are all legal sins and misdemeanors legally punishable or the Muslim judge would announce {{just a part of}} it as punishable? According to the generally accepted legal viewpoint, the legal judge can, if he deems it expedient, penalize (practice ta‘zīr on) the one who has perpetrated an unlawful (ḥarām) act (and some maintain that the unlawful act has to be a cardinal sin), but ta‘zīr should be less at a lower level than ḥadd (legal punishment). The renowned majority of Imāmī and Sunnī jurists have accepted this theory. In contrast, some jurists, including Muḥaqqiq Ardabīlī, have cast doubt on the judgment itself that any unlawful act deserves to be punished through ta‘zīr. Some contemporary jurists have also concluded that there is no reliable evidence that the perpetrator of any unlawful act would deserve ta‘zīr. Some have, even if accepting the judgment itself, interpreted the extent of ta‘zīr {{in such a way that}} it would include admonition, advice, reproach, and threat, as well. It is attempted in this article that while making an analytical statement of the viewpoints of the two sides, the viewpoints of the jurists who agree with this judgment to be seriously criticized and to prove with a dominant legal perspective that there is no jurisprudential or legal evidence for discretionary punishment of any unlawful act and consequently, this viewpoint is not to be easily taken as a foundation for legislation. در مورد افعال ممنوع یا واجبی که برای ارتکاب یا ترک آن‌ها در شریعت، مجازات مشخصی تعیین نشده، تعیین مجازات تعزیری به حاکم واگذار گردیده است. در این‌جا یک پرسش مهمّ و معنی‌دار مطرح می‌شود که آیا این نوع مجازات، کلیّه افعال و تروک محرّم را شامل می‌شود؟ به عبارت دیگر آیا تمامی معاصی شرعی قابل تعزیر می‌باشند یا این‌که حاکم اسلامی فقط بخشی از آن‌ها را قابل تعزیر اعلام می‌کند؟ بر اساس دیدگاه فقهی مشهور، حاکم شرع می‌تواند به صلاح‌دید خود، کسی را که مرتکب عمل حرامی شده است؛ و بر اساس دیدگاه بعضی، عمل حرام لزوماً باید کبیره باشد؛ تعزیر کند ولی باید از مقدار حدّ کم‌تر باشد. مشهور فقیهان امامیّه و اهل سنّت این نظریّه را پذیرفته‌اند. در مقابل، برخی فقیهان از جمله محقّق اردبیلی در اصل این حکم که هر عمل حرامی مستوجب تعزیر باشد تردید کرده‌اند. برخی فقیهان معاصر نیز به این نتیجه رسیده‌اند که دلیل قابل اطمینانی وجود ندارد که مرتکب هر عمل حرامی مستحقّ تعزیر باشد. برخی نیز بر فرض پذیرفتن اصل حکم، دامنه تعزیر را به گونه‌ای معنا کرده‌اند که شامل پند و اندرز، توبیخ و تهدید هم می‌شود. در این مقاله کوشش شده است تا ضمن بیان تحلیلی دیدگاه‌های طرفین، دیدگاه فقیهان موافق این حکم مورد نقد جدّی قرار گرفته و با نگاه غالب فقهی ثابت شود که هیچ دلیل اجتهادی یا فقاهتی بر تعزیر هر فعل حرام وجود ندارد و در نتیجه این دیدگاه به راحتی نباید مبنای قانون‌گذاری قرار گیرد...|$|R

Many philosophers find it intuitive that moral agents are responsible only if they know the particular facts surrounding their action (or inaction). Our results show that whether moral agents are aware of the facts surrounding their (in) action does have an effect on people’s attributions of blame, regardless of the consequences or side effects of the agent’s actions.

This poses new challenges on the expressiveness of security policy design systems, often requiring the use of new security paradigms. In this paper we identify a restricted type of obligation which is useful to express new security policies. This type of obligation includes the following general situations: i) when the two actions involved oblige each other, and ii) when the <b>obligatory</b> <b>action</b> is causally dependent on some previous action. In addition, this type of obligation is enforceable by security monitors, thus enabling its use {{on a variety of}} different platforms. Using a security language and a compiler encompassing this type of obligation we also show how this type of obligation can be efficiently implemented by a security monitor. This is achieved {{with the help of the}} transaction concept: an action that is to be enforced in the future, because it is an obligation according to the defined policy, is part of a transaction that commits successfully only if the <b>obligatory</b> <b>action</b> has been done. To our knowledge this is the first proposal to implement a given type of obligation-based policy using a security monitor. We briefly describe the language and the system implementation and present very encouraging performance results. 1 Introduction The growing number of Internet users and services raises constantly new challenges for defining and ensuring adequate security policies. Most policies implement solely access control barriers, based on the concepts of permission or prohibition, but the current expansion of electronic business will stress, in a near future, the needs for more sophisticated security policies. In particular, we believe that the concept of obligation will have an increasing importance for the expressiveness of such policies. The need for ensuring obligation has already been recognized by several authors [4] and is illustrated by the following examples...|$|E

The response of a defined subtype of the vagal afferent bronchopulmonary C-fibres (conduction velocity < 0. 7 ms− 1) to the putative TRPV 1 activators was studied in vitro in the mouse isolated/perfused lung–nerve preparation. Capsaicin (1 μm) evoked action potential discharge of ∼ 90 % (28 / 31) of C-fibres in the TRPV 1 +/+ mice, but failed to activate bronchopulmonary C-fibres in TRPV 1 −/− animals (n = 10). Anandamide (3 – 100 μm) induced concentration-dependent activation of capsaicin-sensitive TRPV 1 +/+ C-fibres with a threshold of 3 – 10 μm, but failed to evoke substantive discharge in TRPV 1 −/− C-fibres. In the TRPV 1 +/+ mice, the B 2 receptor-mediated activation by bradykinin (1 μm) was restricted to the capsaicin-sensitive C-fibres. Bradykinin was effective in evoking B 2 receptor-mediated action potential discharge in TRPV 1 −/− C-fibres, but the response was significantly (P < 0. 05) less persistent than in TRPV 1 +/+ C-fibres. Exposing the tissue to acid (pH = 5) excited both TRPV 1 +/+ and TRPV 1 −/− C-fibres. We conclude that TRPV 1 is obligatory for vagal C-fibre activation by capsaicin and anandamide. By contrast, whereas TRPV 1 may have a modulatory role in bradykinin and acid-induced activation of bronchopulmonary C-fibres, it is not required for action potential discharge evoked by these stimuli...|$|R
40|$|The first partial ileal bypass {{operation}} {{specifically for the}} reduction of plasma lipids was performed by us in 1963. Since then we have operated upon and followed {{for more than three}} months 126 hyperlipidemic patients. Clinical metabolic studies, before and after the procedure, have demonstrated a 60 % decrease in cholesterol absorption, a 3. 8 -fold increase in total fecal steroid excretion, a 5. 7 -fold increase in cholesterol synthesis, a 3 -fold increase in cholesterol turnover, and a one-third decrease in the miscible cholesterol pool. Circulating cholesterol levels have been lowered an average 41. 1 % from the preoperative but postdietary baseline. An average 53 % cholesterol reduction has been achieved from a pretreatment baseline using a combination of dietary and surgical management. Plasma triglycerides have been reduced in primary hypertriglyceridemic patients (type IV) an average of 52. 6 % from their preoperative but postdietary baseline. One patient died in the hospital and there have been 13 late deaths over the past 10 years. Four cases of postoperative bowel obstruction required reoperation. Diarrhea following partial ileal bypass is, as a rule, transistory and not a significant problem. No appreciable weight loss results from partial ileal bypass, which is an obvious distinction from the results of the far more massive jejuno-ileal bypass procedure for obesity. We have not encountered hepatotoxic, lithogenic, or nephrolithiasis complications in our partial ileal bypass patients. Sixty-nine per cent of our patients with preoperative angina pectoris have postoperative improvement or total remission of this symptom complex. Serial appraisal of followup coronary arteriographic studies offers preliminary evidence for lesion regression.

40|$|This study aims {{to restore}} to virtue, as {{manifest}} in action, a central place in ethical theory, by securing for virtuous action conceptual and evaluative independence from virtuous agency, {{on the one}} hand, and morally <b>obligatory</b> <b>action,</b> on the other. An Aristotelian, rather than a Kantian or consequentialist, perspective emerges as the perspective proper to a study of virtuous action. However, in its emphasis upon actions, rather than upon the qualities of agents, this study differs from Aristotle's ethics, {{as well as from}} most contemporary writings on virtue ethics. To establish the conceptual autonomy of virtuous action, relative to virtuous agency, I posit the primacy of virtue itself and identify virtuous action as secondary to, and informed by, virtue. An action is informed by virtue just in case it is good and fitting. A good action is one whose aim is good, where the aim of an action is neither the intention of the agent nor the actual or probable consequence of the action, but the consequence which a reasonable person would have grounds for inferring is the intended consequence of the action. Virtuous action, so defined, has value and is not merely the expression of the agent's virtue or good motives. Hence, the value of virtuous action does not derive from the agent's virtue or the value of his motives. I distinguish virtuous action from morally <b>obligatory</b> <b>action</b> in three ways: (1) by showing that some obligatory actions lack fittingness, which is a necessary condition for virtuous action; (2) by showing that my definition of virtuous action distinguishes the concept of virtuous action from the deontic concepts of special obligation, supererogation and imperfect duty; (3) by arguing that the ethical perspective proper to an analysis of the nature of virtuous action is genuinely distinct from the ethical perspective which informs modern theories of obligation. Examining the question of the limits of obligation, I argue that there are actions which are morally good and non-obligatory, by proposing criteria of non-obligatoriness in actions and by presenting four examples of actions which, given these criteria, are non-obligatory, yet are virtuous and moral...|$|E

Zira Hanefi fürû eserler incelendiğinde kat’î delil ile sabit olmayan bazı fiillerin de farz olarak isimlendirildiği görülmektedir. Söz gelimi namazdaki son oturuş, abdestte başın dörtte birinin meshi gibi hususlar kat’î delil ile sabit olmadığı halde Hanefiler tarafından farz olarak isimlendirilmiştir. Sonraki Hanefi fakihler bu problemi çözme adına i’tikâdî ve amelî (içtihâdî ve zannî olarak da isimlendirilmektedir) olmak üzere farzın iki türünün olduğunu ve inkârı küfrü gerektirmeyen söz konusu farzların i’tikâdî değil amelî farz türünden olduğunu belirtmişlerdir. Bu makalenin amacı, Hanefi eserlerde yer yer geçen amelî farzın mahiyetini anlamaya çalışmaktır. Bu minvalde kaynaklarda geçen amelî farz örnekleri ele alınıp incelenecek ve böylece amelî farzın ne anlama geldiği, amelî farz ile i’tikâdî farz ve vâcib arasındaki farkın ne olduğu, amelî farzın vâcibin bir türü olup olmadığı, hangi delil ile amelî farzın sabit olacağı ve Hanefilerin neden böyle bir kavrama ihtiyaç duydukları gibi birbiriyle bağlantılı konular açıklığa kavuşturulmaya çalışılacaktır. Extended Abstract According to Hanafits, the fard (obligation) is proved by solid {{evidence}} (al-dalil al-kat’i) {{that does not}} include any doubt. Therefore, to deny a judgment which is fard makes a person disbeliever. So, because of praying (al-salah), fasting, pilgrimage and al-zakah are proved by {{solid evidence}}, there is no problem in calling them as fard. However, when the writings of füru-i fiqh (the branch of fiqh) are examined, it could be seen that some of the subjects which are not proved by the solid evidence and which are disputed between the ummah are also evaluated as fard by the Hanafits. For example, although the last sitting in the prayer (al-ka’da al-aherah), and to wipe one of the four pieces of head (mashu rub’i al-ra’s) are not proved by solid evidence, they are evaluated by the Hanafits as fard. In the following period, some Hanafits have divided the fard into two parts to solve this problem. The first is proved by solid evidence and to deny it makes the person disbeliever. The second is to deny it does not make the person disbeliever. The first is called as an al-fard al-i’tikadî whereas the latter is named as al-fard al-amalî. The latter is also known as al-fard al-ijtihadî and al-fard al-zannî. However, considering the definition of fard in the usul al-fiqh, it is a problem that the al-fard al-amalî is called fard. Because according to the definition in the usul al-fiqh, to deny the fard requires a lack of faith. Perhaps because of this, some of the subsequent Hanafite scholars have regarded al-fard al-amalî a kind of wâcib. Because the wâcib is proved by an uncertain evidence (al-dalil al-zanni), denying it does not make a person disbeliever. In this respect, there is no problem in placing the concept of al-fard al-amalî within the scope of the wâcib concept. According to this point, {{there are two types of}} wâcib: the first is obligatory to do it and if it is not fillfulled, relevant worship becomes invalid (bâtıl). The other is that if it is absence the worship is valid but is deficient. In this case, however, a problem has appeared: Although both are proved by the uncertain evidence, why does it make worship invalid when one of these is absent, or why does it make valid the worship when the other is absent? For this, we first need to briefly talk about the Hanafit's understanding of the concept of fard: According to Hanafits, for something to be fard, it is necessary that whole community of Muslims has agreed on it’s being fard. So, some subjects proved by al-habar al-wahid (information of one person) or al-habar al-mashhur (information that became famous) were also seen as al-fard al-i’tikadî by Hanafits, because they have been agreed on by whole community of Muslims. When these examples are examined, it is seen that there is no disagreement among ummah about whether these actions are fard or not. For example, though the second prostrating (al-sacdah) in the prayer is proved by al-habar al-wahid, Hanafits have seen it as fard/rükun. Further, although the message of “Pligrimage is Arafat” has been generally accepted as mashhur, all of the Hanafits have seen the staying at Arafat (wakfah) as fard. Because there is no disagreement on that these actions are fard, agreement (icma) has arisen on these subjects. So, uncertain evidences about these subjects have become certain by ijma (agreement). Hanafits have accepted the actions which are proved by solid evidence or reasoning (istidlal) for them as <b>obligatory</b> <b>actions</b> whose fulfillment is necessary. But if it is disagreed upon whether these actions are fard or not, then Hanafits have kept away from calling this action as al-fard al-i’tikadi. For example, because al-Imam Mâlik has accepted last sitting in prayer as sunnah, Hanafits accepted it as al-fard al-amalî, not fard. For this reason, even if such an action had been taken as fard in Hanafit sources, subsequents Hanafits had clearly stated that this action is al-fard al-amalî. For Hanafits, the difference between al-fard al-amalî and ordinary wâcib such as reading al-Fatiha in prayer is that abandonment of al-fard al-amalî prevents validity of prayer. The reason of this is that it is certain and its fulfillment is seen as absolutely necessary according to mujtahid’s estimation. Therefore, if an action’s evident, though there is a disagreement on it, got power according to mujtahid’s estimation and come near the degree of certain evident and for this reason mujtahid sees its fulfillment as necessary and thinks that in the absence of this action worship is invalid, then this action is called as al-fard al-amalî. In this respect, it is possible to define al-fard al-amalî in this way: It is an action that the fulfillment is seen as necessary and whose abandonment is prohibited by a certain evident or reasoning according to mujtahid’s estimation and in whose absence the worship is not valid but whose denying it doesn’t entail disbelief. ” Accordingly, Hanafits regard the concept of fard as “Islamic circle. ” So, for them worships such as prayer, fasting, zakah and pilgrimage which are accepted by all muslims and take place in al-darurât al-diniyyeh (religious necessities) are fard. In this respect, it is possible to accept that al-fard al-amalî has been categorized between al-fard al-i’tikadi and wâcib by subsequent Hanafits to prevent the accusation of disbelief. It seems more proper to take al-fard al-amalî as an intermediate concept and distinct category. Because its definition and judgement is different from fard, it is not proper to call it as fard. It is not proper also to call it as wâcib, because almost in all works of furu, wâcib is used in the sense of “an action which in the case of its abandonment the prayer is valid. ...|$|R
40|$|The ionic {{mechanism}} {{underlying the}} hyperpolarizing action of adenosine and adenine nucleotides was studied {{by measuring the}} efflux of 43 K or 86 Rb from sinus venosus and interauricular septum of tortoise heart. Preparations rendered quiescent by high-K (27 mM) Ringer solution were used. Adenosine and ATP increased the efflux of 43 K and 86 Rb from sinus venosus. The magnitude of the responses varied from preparation to preparation, {{but in the same}} tissue adenosine and ATP were of equal efficacy. When dose-response relationships could be determined, the adenyl compounds were found to be of similar potency. Km for adenosine was 6. 2 X 10 (- 6) M, for ATP 8. 3 X 10 (- 6) M. Regional variations in the magnitude of the responses were observed. The largest responses were obtained from the muscular strip of sinus venosus near its junction with atrium, and from the right horn of the sinus venosus. In interauricular septum the adenyl compounds caused only a slight increase in isotope efflux. Acetylcholine, by contrast, produced large increases in 86 Rb efflux from all these preparations. Thus the distribution of the purinoceptors in the tortoise heart is more confined than that of the muscarinic receptors. Antagonism of the response to adenyl compounds by theophylline and 8 -phenyltheophylline was studied. The apparent Ki for theophylline was 10 (- 5) M; that for 8 -phenyltheophylline about 10 (- 6) M. Atropine did not inhibit the responses to the adenyl compounds. These results indicate that the changes in K permeability produced by adenosine and ATP are mediated by P 1 -purinoceptors. The adenosine transport inhibitors, dipyridamole and nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR), had no effect on the adenyl-induced responses, indicating that adenosine uptake is of little importance in tortoise sinus venosus. The effects of phosphate-modified ATP analogues were studied. Adenylimidodiphosphate (APPNP) produced increases in 86 Rb efflux similar to those found with ATP, confirming that breakdown of ATP to adenosine is not <b>obligatory</b> for its <b>action</b> at P 1 -purinoceptors. Alpha-beta methylene ATP (APCPP) and beta-gamma methylene ATP (APPCP) produced much smaller effects, which may be explained by their structural and chemical differences from ATP. The use of 86 Rb as a tracer (Rb: K less than 0. 01 in load solution) gives qualitatively similar results to those obtained when 43 K is used to study the permeability increases produced by the adenyl compounds or acetylcholine. Quantitative differences in the measures obtained with the two isotopes, however, become apparent when the efflux of both is studied simultaneously. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|R

The least expected time required for m(? n) of them to meet together at a single point, if all players {{have to use the}} same strategy, is the symmetric rendezvous value Rsm,n. If the players can use different strategies, the least expected meeting time is the asymmetric rendezvous value Ram,n. show that Ra 3, 2 is 47 / 48 and Rsn,n is asymptotic to n/ 2. If the minimax rendezvous time Mn is the minimum time required to ensure that all players can meet together at a single point regardless of their initial placement, we prove that M 2 is 3, M 3 is 4 and Mn is asymptotic to n/ 2. If players have to stick together upon meeting, we prove that three players require 5 time units to ensure a meeting. We also consider a problem proposed by S. Alpern (in his joint paper with A. Beck, Rendezvous Search on the Line with Bounded Resources, LSE Math Preprint Series, 92 (1995)) of how two players can optimally rendezvous {{while at the same time}} evading an enemy searcher. We model this rendezvous-evasion problem as a two-person, zero-sum game between the rendezvous team R (with agents R 1, R 2) and the searcher S and consider a version which is discrete in time and space. R 1, R 2 and S start at different locations among n identical locations and no two of them share a common labelling of the locations. Each player can move between any two locations in one time step (this includes the possibility of staying still) until at least two of them are at the same location together, at which time the game ends. If S is at this location, S (maximizer) wins and the payoff is 1; otherwise the team R (minimizer) wins and the payoff is 0. The value of the game vn is the probability that S wins under optimal play. We assume that R 1 and R 2 can jointly randomize their strategies and prove that V 3 is 47 / 76 ? 0. 61842 and v 4 is at least 31 / 54 ? 0. 57407. If all the players share a common notion of a directed cycle containing all the n locations (while still able to move between any two locations), the value of the game dn is ((1 - 2 /n) n- 1 + l) / 2. In particular, d 3 is less than v 3 and d 4 is less than v 4. We also compare some of these results with those obtained when the rendezvous-evasion game is modelled as a multi-stage game with observed actions (W. S. Lim, Rendezvous-Evasion As a Multi-Stage Game With Observed Actions, LSE Math-CDAM Research Report Series, 96 - 05 (1996)). In all instances considered, we find that <b>obligatory</b> announcement of <b>actions</b> at the end of each step either does not affect the value of the game or helps the rendezvous team secure a lower value...|$|R
