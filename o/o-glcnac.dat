2500|$|Glycosylation (see also {{chemical}} glycosylation) is {{the reaction}} in which a carbohydrate, i.e. a glycosyl donor, {{is attached to a}} hydroxyl or other functional group of another molecule (a glycosyl acceptor). In biology glycosylation mainly refers in particular to the enzymatic process that attaches glycans to proteins, lipids, or other organic molecules. This enzymatic process produces one of the fundamental biopolymers found in cells (along with DNA, RNA, and proteins). Glycosylation is a form of co-translational and post-translational modification. Glycans serve a variety of structural and functional roles in membrane and secreted proteins. The majority of proteins synthesized in the rough ER undergo glycosylation. It is an enzyme-directed site-specific process, as opposed to the non-enzymatic chemical reaction of glycation. Glycosylation is also present in the cytoplasm and nucleus as the <b>O-GlcNAc</b> modification. Aglycosylation is a feature of engineered antibodies to bypass glycosylation. Five classes of glycans are produced: ...|$|E
50|$|O-GlcNAcylation {{is a form}} of glycosylation, the {{site-specific}} enzymatic {{addition of}} saccharides to proteins and lipids. This form of glycosylation is with O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine or beta-O-linked 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glycopyranose (<b>O-GlcNAc).</b> In this form, a single sugar (β-N-acetylglucosamine) is added to serine and threonine residues of nuclear or cytoplasmic proteins. Two conserved enzymes control this glycosylation of serine and threonine: <b>O-GlcNAc</b> transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA). While OGT catalyzes the addition of <b>O-GlcNAc</b> to serine and threonine, OGA catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of <b>O-GlcNAc</b> from post-transitionally modified proteins.|$|E
50|$|PUGNAc is a 1,5-hydroximolactone, {{acting as}} an {{inhibitor}} {{of a variety}} of N-acetylhexosaminidases. It was long thought that increased levels of <b>O-GlcNAc</b> in human cells lead to Type II diabetes. <b>O-GlcNAc</b> levels were artificially raised with PUGNAc, which inhibits O-GlcNAcase, a beta-exo-N-acetylhexosaminidase which cleaves beta-O-linked-N-acetylglucosamine residues from glycoproteins. As a result of this inhibition, a type II diabetic phenotype was observed. Recent pharmacological studies using a more selective O-GlcNAcase inhibitor did not see this effect. However, genetic manipulation of <b>O-GlcNAc</b> levels is consistent with the effects observed by PUGNAc, namely insulin resistance upon elevation of <b>O-GlcNAc</b> levels.|$|E
50|$|The post-translational {{modification}} of proteins by <b>O-GlcNAc</b> is spurred by glucose flux through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. OGT catalyzes attachment of the <b>O-GlcNAc</b> group to serine and threonine, while O-GlcNAcase spurs sugar removal.|$|E
5000|$|<b>O-GlcNAc</b> {{transferase}} ( [...] , <b>O-GlcNAc</b> transferase, OGTase, O-linked N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, uridine diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine:polypeptide beta-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, protein O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine transferase) is {{an enzyme}} with systematic name UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine:protein-O-beta-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl transferase. In humans the enzyme is encoded by the OGT gene.|$|E
50|$|<b>O-GlcNAc</b> {{is added}} to serines or threonines by <b>O-GlcNAc</b> {{transferase}} (OGT). <b>O-GlcNAc</b> appears to occur on most serines and threonines {{that would otherwise be}} phosphorylated by serine/threonine kinases. Thus, if phosphorylation occurs, <b>O-GlcNAc</b> does not, and vice versa. This apparently competitive modification of certain sites may have significant consequences for some research directions. Much cancer research is focused on phosphorylation, because of its important role in cell signalling pathways. As competitive or variable glycosylation occurs at the same sites, there is a risk that phosphorylation research has overlooked important roles that these modification sites play when glycosylated. <b>O-GlcNAc</b> addition and removal also appears to be a key regulator of the pathways that are disrupted in diabetes mellitus. The gene encoding the O-GlcNAcase (OGA) enzyme has been linked to non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. It is the terminal step in a nutrient-sensing hexosamine signaling pathway.|$|E
50|$|O-GlcNAcylation and {{phosphorylation}} have {{a complex}} signaling relationship. The same enzyme complex that removes O-phosphate is indicated {{to be the}} same enzyme complex that attaches <b>O-GlcNAc.</b> In some cases, though <b>O-GlcNAc</b> and O-phosphate occur at adjacent, separate sites, they still appear to be reciprocal.|$|E
50|$|Over 600 {{proteins}} are {{targets for}} O-GlcNAcylation. While the functional effects of <b>O-GlcNAc</b> modification {{is not fully}} known, {{it is known that}} <b>O-GlcNAc</b> modification impacts many cellular activities such as lipid/carbohydrate metabolism and hexosamine biosynthesis. Modified proteins may modulate various downstream signaling pathways by influencing transcription and proteomic activities.|$|E
50|$|<b>O-GlcNAc</b> cycles rapidly on and {{off most}} proteins, unlike most mature glycans, {{depending}} on both the protein and the protein site it attaches to. External signals and inhibitors of O-GlcNAcase have {{also been shown to}} affect <b>O-GlcNAc</b> cycling, and rates were recently quantified to have half-lives of 1 minute or less.|$|E

50|$|Hsieh-Wilson and {{her colleagues}} {{have found that the}} covalent-modifications of {{intercellular}} proteins by O-linked-N-acetylglucosamine (<b>O-GlcNAc)</b> within the mammalian nervous system have a large role in the regulation of gene expression, neuronal signaling, and synaptic plasticity. This post-translational modification, has been analysed in the rat brain using a novel chemoenzymatic strategy wherein <b>O-GlcNAc</b> modified proteins are selectively labeled with flourecent or biotin tags. This technique developed by Hsieh-Wilson and her lab has revealed over 200 <b>O-GlcNAc</b> modified proteins within the mammilian brain and such modifications have been shown to activate transcriptional function of proteins, regulate cancer metabolism, regulate gene expression and memory formation, and carry out many other tasks in the brain and beyond.|$|E
50|$|<b>O-GlcNAc</b> {{transferase}} {{is a part}} of a host {{of biological}} functions within the human body. OGT is involved in the resistance of insulin in muscle cells and adipocytes by inhibiting the Threonine 308 phosphorylation of AKT1, increasing the rate of IRS1 phosphorylation (at Serine 307 and Serine 632/635), reducing insulin signaling, and glycosylating components of insulin signals. Additionally, <b>O-GlcNAc</b> transferase catalyzes intracellular glycosylation of serine and threonine residues with the addition of N-acetylglucosamine. Studies show that OGT alleles are vital for embryogenesis, and that OGT is necessary for intracellular glycosylation and embryonic stem cell vitality. <b>O-GlcNAc</b> transferase also catalyzes the posttranslational modification that modifies transcription factors and RNA polymerase II, however the specific function of this modification is mostly unknown.|$|E

50|$|This {{regulation}} {{is important for}} multiple cellular processes including transcription, signal transduction, and proteasomal degradation. Also, there is competitive regulation between OGT and kinase for the protein to attach to a phosphate group or <b>O-GlcNAc,</b> which can alter the function of proteins in the body through downstream effects. OGT inhibits the activity of 6-phosophofructosekinase PFKL by mediating the glycosylation process. This then acts {{as a part of}} glycolysis regulation. <b>O-GlcNAc</b> has been defined as a negative transcription regulator in response to steroid hormone signaling.|$|E

50|$|Protein {{glycosylation}} {{has long}} been regarded not {{to occur in the}} cytoplasmic/nuclear compartments of the cell. However, research {{during the past two decades}} has clearly shown that <b>O-GlcNAc</b> is one of the most abundant posttranslational modifications within the nucleocytoplasmic compartments of all members of the Metazoan division, including animals, the viruses that infect them, and plants. It is found on hundreds, if not thousands, of nucleocytoplasmic proteins, and in fact many of the most heavily studied proteins in biology are O-GlcNAcylated. There has been no evidence of <b>O-GlcNAc</b> outside of cells.|$|E
50|$|Nucleocytoplasmic O-β-GlcNAc in {{particular}} {{has been found in}} all multicellular organisms investigated, including fungi, worms, insects, plants and humans. Everywhere that serine and threonine O-phosphorylation has been found, <b>O-GlcNAc</b> occurs.|$|E

50|$|Recently, <b>O-GlcNAc</b> was {{reported}} to occur between the fifth and sixth conserved cysteines in some EGF-like repeats from the Notch protein. This modification is performed by a second O-N-acetyglucosaminyl-transferase named eOGT.|$|E
50|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of glycosyltransferases, {{specifically}} the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine:protein beta-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl-transferase. Other names in common use include uridine diphosphoacetylglucosamine-protein, acetylglucosaminyltransferase, uridine diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine:polypeptide, beta-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, and <b>O-GlcNAc</b> transferase.|$|E

50|$|It {{appears as}} though C3orf62 {{may have a}} YinOYang site at residue 115, meaning that this Threonine residue is {{predicted}} to be O-GlycNAcylated as well as phosphorylated. This site may be reversibly and dynamically modified by <b>O-GlcNAc</b> or Phosphate groups at different times in the cell.|$|E
50|$|Research about <b>O-GlcNAc</b> is {{particularly}} relevant to chronic human diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer, {{the last of}} which is heavily dependent on glycolysis and phosphorylation. Additionally, O-GlcNAcylation {{plays a crucial role}} in regulating tau, a microtubule protein whose pathology is correlated to the severity of dementia in Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
50|$|Dyslipidemia is an {{abnormal}} amount of lipids (e.g. triglycerides, cholesterol and/or fat phospholipids) in the blood. In developed countries, most dyslipidemias are hyperlipidemias; that is, {{an elevation of}} lipids in the blood. This is often due to diet and lifestyle. Prolonged elevation of insulin levels {{can also lead to}} dyslipidemia. Likewise, increased levels of <b>O-GlcNAc</b> transferase (OGT) may cause dyslipidemia.|$|E
50|$|There is {{potential}} for regulation of O-GlcNAcase {{for the treatment}} of Alzheimer's disease. When the tau protein in the brain is hyperphosphorylated, neurofibrillary tangles form, which are a pathological hallmark for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. In order to treat this condition, OGA is targeted by inhibitors such as Thiamet-G in order to prevent <b>O-GlcNAc</b> from being removed from tau, which assists in preventing tau from becoming phosphorylated.|$|E

50|$|<b>O-GlcNAc</b> {{transferase}} {{is part of}} {{a dynamic}} competition for a serine or threonine hydroxyl functional group in a peptide unit. Figure 3 shows an example of both reciprocal same-site occupancy and adjacent-site occupancy. For the same-site occupancy, OGT competes with kinase to catalyze the glycosylation of the protein instead of phosphorylation. The adjacent-site occupancy example shows the naked protein catalyzed by OGT converted to a glycoprotein, which can increase the turnover of proteins such as the tumor repressor p53.|$|E
50|$|OGA is {{a member}} of the family of hexosaminidases. However, unlike {{lysosomal}} hexosaminidases, OGA activity is the highest at neutral pH (~7) and it localizes mainly to the cytosol. OGA and OGT are synthesized from two conserved genes (OGA is encoded by MGEA5) and are expressed throughout the human body with high levels in the brain and pancreas. The products of <b>O-GlcNAc</b> and the process itself plays a role in embryonic development, brain activity, hormone production, and a myriad of other activities.|$|E
5000|$|Studies {{show that}} <b>O-GlcNAc</b> {{transferase}} interacts {{directly with the}} Ten eleven translocation 2 (TET2) enzyme, which converts 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and regulates gene transcription. Additionally, increasing levels of OGT for O-GlcNAcylation may have therapeutic effects for Alzheimer's disease patients. Brain glucose metabolism is impaired in Alzheimer's disease, and a study suggests that this leads to hyperphosphorylation of tau and degerenation of tau O-GlcNCAcylation. Replenishing tau O-GlcNacylation in the brain along with protein phosphatase could deter this process and improve brain glucose metabolism.|$|E

In agreement, Reinhardt’s method for cytoplasmic/nuclear discrimination predicts FAM63B {{to be located}} in the nucleus with a reliability of 76.7%. The presence of both NLS and NES signals and <b>O-GlcNAc</b> post-translational modification of FAM63B supports the protein's location in both the nucleus and cytoplasm and the discovered protein function as a shuttle for vaccinia virus between the nucleus and the cell periphery.|$|E
