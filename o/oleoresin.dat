The neutral fractions of gum <b>oleoresins</b> and turpentine oils mainly consisted of α-pinene, Δ- 3 -carene and β-pinene. A difference in chemical composition with locality was recognized for the turpentine oils and neutral fractions of gum <b>oleoresins.</b> While examining the chemical composition of the acidic fractions of gum <b>oleoresins</b> and rosins, we found that relative retention time could not be used to identify each resin acid. Based on mass spectral comparison, the major constituents of the acidic fractions and rosins were identified as sandaracopimaric acid, isopimaric acid, palustric acid, dehydroabietic acid, abietic acid, neoabietic acid and merkusic acid. The major component of the acidic fractions was palustric acid, while that of both rosin 1 and 2 was abietic acid.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Essential oils are {{the most}} {{important}} compounds produced during secondary metabolism in aromatic plants. Essential oils are volatile, have characteristic odor and are used as defensive agents by plants. In pepper, it is possible to say that essential oils are the &# 8220;flavor fingerprint&# 8221; of each species. In the present article, eight species of pepper were studied in order to extract their essential oils and <b>oleoresins,</b> test their antibacterial and antifungal activities and also to identify the compounds present in the most bioactive samples. Results demonstrated that two essential oils [Pimenta dioica (L.) Merr. and Schinus terebinthifolius] and three <b>oleoresins</b> (Schinus terebinthifolius and Piper nigrum white and black) recorded significant antimicrobial activity. These active essential oils and <b>oleoresins</b> are interesting for use in biotechnological processes employed in food, pharmaceutical and other industries...|$|R

50|$|The active {{ingredient}} in pepper spray is capsaicin, {{which is a}} chemical derived from the fruit of plants in the Capsicum genus, including chilis.

The aim {{of this study is to}} examine the antioxidant potential of capsaicin and capsicum <b>oleoresins</b> produced from Capsicum sp. cultivated in R. of Macedonia. This experiment comprises four different genotypes of Capsicum annuum L., which were used for obtaining ethanolic <b>oleoresins.</b> Their antioxidant potential was measured and compared to the antioxidative potential of the pure capsaicin standards. As a method for measuring the total antioxidant capacity was used FRAP (Ferric reducing antioxidant potential) method. This is a simple photometric method for estimation of in vitro antioxidative potential which is expressed as µmol/L Fe 2 +. As expected from the previous findings of capsaicin, results from this study are also showing that it posses antioxidative potential that is not so high. But, there is a good correlation between antioxidant potential of capsaicin and capsicum <b>oleoresins</b> in addition of the capsaicin content measured in <b>oleoresins.</b> The results are showing that antioxidative potential of hot peppers does not come only from the vitamins and phenolic compounds in them, but alkaloids (capsaicinoids) are also included. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The risk {{of chronic}} {{diseases}} {{has been shown}} to be inversely related to tomato intake and the lycopene levels in serum and tissue. Cis-isomers represent approximately 50 %– 80 % of serum lycopene, while dietary lycopene maintains the isomeric ratio present in the plant sources with about 95 % of all-trans-lycopene. Supercritical CO 2 extraction (S-CO 2) has been extensively developed to extract lycopene from tomato and tomato processing wastes, for food or pharmaceutical industries, also by using additional plant sources as co-matrices. We compared two S-CO 2 -extracted <b>oleoresins</b> (from tomato and tomato/hazelnut matrices), which showed an oil-solid bi-phasic appearance, a higher cis-lycopene content, and enhanced antioxidant ability compared with the traditional solvent extracts. Heat-treating, in the range of 60 – 100 °C, led to changes in the lycopene isomeric composition and to enhanced antioxidant activity in both types of <b>oleoresins.</b> The greater stability has been related to peculiar lycopene isomer composition and to the lipid environment. The results indicate these <b>oleoresins</b> are a good source of potentially healthful lycopene...|$|R
