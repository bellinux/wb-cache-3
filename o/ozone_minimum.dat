40|$|The quasi-stationary {{pattern of}} the Antarctic total ozone has changed during the last 4 decades, showing an eastward shift in the zonal <b>ozone</b> <b>minimum.</b> In this work, the {{association}} between the longitudinal shift of the zonal <b>ozone</b> <b>minimum</b> and changes in meteorological fields in austral spring (September–November) for 1979 – 2014 is analyzed using ERA-Interim and NCEP–NCAR reanalyses. Regressive, correlative and anomaly composite analyses are applied to reanalysis data. Patterns of the Southern Annular Mode and quasi-stationary zonal waves 1 and 3 in the meteorological fields show relationships with interannual variability in the longitude of the zonal <b>ozone</b> <b>minimum.</b> On decadal timescales, consistent longitudinal shifts of the zonal <b>ozone</b> <b>minimum</b> and zonal wave 3 pattern in the middle-troposphere temperature at the southern midlatitudes are shown. Attribution runs of the chemistry–climate version of the Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator (ACCESS-CCM) model suggest that long-term shifts of the zonal <b>ozone</b> <b>minimum</b> are separately contributed by changes in ozone-depleting substances and greenhouse gases. As is known, Antarctic ozone depletion in spring is strongly projected on the Southern Annular Mode in summer and impacts summertime surface climate across the Southern Hemisphere.

The data show that a clearly defined minimum in ozone relative to the local ozone field extends throughout the stratosphere from the tropopause to above 50 km, though decreasing in intensity with altitude. Near 18 km ozone in the ozone hole is 50 percent less than the average surrounding ozone. But even at 50 km the ozone is 20 percent less than the surrounding ozone field.

Furthermore it was found that in both polar regions the ozone depletion events were confined to the planetary boundary layer with a capping temperature inversion at the upper limit of the ozone poor air mass. Inside this ozone poor layer a stable stratification was obvious. Back-trajectories analyses revealed that the ozone depleted air masses were transported across the marine, ice-covered regions of the central Arctic and the South Atlantic Ocean. These comparable observations in both polar regions suggest a similar ozone destruction mechanism which is responsible for an efficient ozone decay. Nevertheless distinct differences could be found regarding the vertical structure of the ozone depleted layers. In the Arctic the ozone poor layer developed from the surface up to a temperature inversion, whereas in the Antarctic elevated ozone depleted air masses due to the influence of catabatic surface winds were observed...|$|R

The examination of the behavior of the general ozone-hole area suggests the existence of at least three distinct regions: (1) the region below 33 km, where ozone follows the pattern of the ozone hole, exhibiting a strong trend since 1979 and decreasing from late August to a minimum in October; (2) the 33 - 43 km height region of relatively stable ozone concentration; and (3) the region above 43 km, where ozone is again fluctuating, with a decrease during September to a minimum in October...|$|E

In this study, the vertical structure of this <b>ozone</b> <b>minimum</b> is examined using ozonesonde measurements performed over Irene on 15 May 2002, when the total ozone (as given by TOMS) was about 226 DU. Indeed, {{it is found that}} the <b>ozone</b> <b>minimum</b> is of Antarctic polar origin with a low-ozone layer in the middle stratosphere above 625 K and of tropical origin with low-ozone layer between 400 -K and 450 -K isentropic levels in the lower stratosphere. The upper and lower depleted parts of the ozonesonde profile for 15 May, are respectively attributed to equatorward and poleward transport of low-ozone air toward the subtropics. The tropical air moving over Irene and the polar one passing over the same area associated with enhanced planetary-wave activity are simulated successfully using a high-resolution advection contour model (MIMOSA) of Potential Vorticity. Indeed, in mid-May 2002, MIMOSA maps show a polar vortex filament in the middle stratosphere above the 625 -K isentropic level and they show also tropical air-masses moving southward (over Irene) in the lower stratosphere between 400 -K and 450 -K isentropic levels. The winter stratospheric wave driving and its associated localized isentropic mixing leading to the <b>ozone</b> <b>minimum</b> are investigated by means of two diagnostic tools: the Eliassen-Palm flux and the effective diffusivity computed from the European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) fields. The unusual distribution of ozone over Irene during May 2002 in the middle stratosphere is closely connected to the anomalously pre-conditioned structure of the polar vortex at that time of the year. Indeed, the perturbed vortex was typically predisposed for easy erosion by dynamical transport processes, which have been driven by strong planetary wave activity and have eventually resulted in a very large latitudinal advection of polar air masses towards the subtropics. The exceptional presence of polar vortex air over the subtropics during May 2002 can be considered as the first sign of the particular polar vortex disturbances, which after being well reinforced, contributed to the unprecedented behavior of the Antarctic spring ozone hole observed during September 2002...|$|E

Such quantities have been used frequently in ozone assessments by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and also to assess the performance of chemistry-climate models. The most commonly considered quantities are March and October mean column ozone poleward of geometric latitude 63 &deg; and the spring minimum of daily total <b>ozone</b> <b>minima</b> poleward of a given latitude. Particularly in the Arctic, the former measure is affected by vortex variability and vortex break-up in spring. The minimum of daily total <b>ozone</b> <b>minima</b> poleward of a particular latitude is debatable, insofar as it relies on one single measurement or model grid point. We find that, for Arctic conditions, this minimum value often occurs in air outside the polar vortex, both in the observations and in a chemistry-climate model. Neither of the two measures shows a good correlation with chemical ozone loss in the vortex deduced from observations. We recommend that the minimum of daily minima should no longer be used when comparing polar ozone loss in observations and models. As an alternative to the March and October mean column polar ozone we suggest considering the minimum of daily average total ozone poleward of 63 &deg; equivalent latitude in spring (except for winters with an early vortex break-up). Such a definition both obviates relying on one single data point and reduces the impact of year-to-year variability in the Arctic vortex break-up on ozone loss measures. Further, this measure shows a reasonable correlation (r=&ndash; 0. 75) with observed chemical ozone loss. Nonetheless, simple measures of polar ozone loss must be used with caution; if possible, it is preferable to use more sophisticated measures that include additional information to disentangle the impact of transport and chemistry on ozone...|$|R

For the Arctic, these monthly means were found to be insensitive to the exact choice of the latitude threshold, unlike the Antarctic where greater sensitivity was found. Choosing a threshold based on the location of the transport barrier at the vortex boundary instead of geometric latitude led to a roughly similar year-to-year variability of the monthly means, but in particular years deviations of several tens of Dobson units occurred. Moreover, the minimum of daily total <b>ozone</b> <b>minima</b> poleward of a particular latitude, another popular measure, is debatable, insofar as it relies on one single measurement or model grid point. For Arctic conditions, this minimum value occurred often in air outside polar vortex, both in the observations and in a chemistry-climate model. As a result, we recommend that the minimum of daily minima no longer be used when comparing polar ozone loss in observations and models. As a possible alternative, we suggest considering the minimum of daily average total ozone poleward of a particular equivalent latitude (or in the vortex) in spring. This definition both obviates relying on one single data point and reduces the impact of year-to-year variability in the Arctic vortex breakup on ozone loss measures. However, compact relations of such simple measures with meteorological quantities that describe the potential for polar heterogeneous chlorine activation and thus ozone loss were not found. Therefore, we argue that where possible, more sophisticated measures of chemical polar ozone loss that include additional information to disentangle the impact of transport and chemistry on ozone, should be employed...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} regular {{observations from}} the MOZAIC data base over Africa (1994 – 2004) {{to highlight the}} role of Hadley cells in tropical ozone production. We show the presence in the African upper troposphere (9 – 12 km) of a minimum of ozone and of a maximum of relative humidity that both follow the meridional migration of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). We suggest that mechanisms contributing to meridional ozone gradients (0. 3 to 1. 5 ppbv deg− 1) {{on both sides of}} the <b>ozone</b> <b>minimum</b> in the 20 °S– 20 °N latitude band are (1) the vertical transport of relatively poor ozone air masses by tropical convection, and (2) the photochemical production of ozone in upper-level branches of the Hadley circulation. Depending on the season and on the meridional side of the ITCZ, ozone precursors injected in the ascending branch of the ITCZ include biomass burning, biogenic, lightning and anthropogenic emissions...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{combined}} CO 2 and CFCl 3 and CF 2 Cl 2 time-dependent scenarios on atmospheric O 3 and temperature are described; the steady-state levels of O 3 and surface temperature, {{to which the}} chlorofluoromethane scenario tends {{in the presence of}} twice and four time ambient CO 2, are examined; and surface temperature changes, caused by the combined effects, are established. A description of the model and of the experiments is presented. Results indicate that (1) the total ozone time history is significantly different from that due to the chlorofluoromethane alone; (2) a local <b>ozone</b> <b>minimum</b> occurs in the upper stratosphere about 45 years from the present with a subsequent ozone increase, then decline; and (3) steady-state solutions indicate that tropospheric temperature and water vapor increases, associated with increased infrared opacity, cause significant changes in tropospheric ozone levels for 2 x CO 2 and 4 x CO 2, without the addition of chlorofluoromethanes...|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of the ozone concetration components of the Antarctic ozone hole as related to seasonal and year-to-year temperature changes in August, September, October, and November during the 1979 - 1985 period is studied using a zonally averaged model in which all transport fields are fixed by input temperature data. The results suggest that, prior to 1984, both the seasonal and year-to year variability of the zonal-mean Antarctic <b>ozone</b> <b>minimum</b> and the surrounding maximum can {{be accounted for by}} temperature dynamics without invoking changes in chemical composition (e. g., chlorine content) or special chemistry. The same dynamical mechanism also accounts for the good simulation of the observed seasonal and latitudinal structure of column ozone {{in other parts of the}} world. However, chemical depletion of ozone may have become more important after 1984. The model also appears to underpredict the September ozone decline in years, leading to an underprediction of the recent minimum values in the Antarctic ozone hole...|$|E

40|$|Ozonesonde {{measurements}} of the polar atmosphere obtained at Andenes, Norway during July 1999 showed unusual characteristics when compared with mid- or low-latitude <b>ozone</b> profiles. A <b>minimum</b> of two ozonesondes each day were released, one in late afternoon and one in early evening. A very well-defined ledge in the ozone profile corresponding to the tropopause appears to form {{as a result of}} transport. The ozone amount increases four to five times, from about 30 nb at the tropopause to 120 nb at a pressure about 10 - 20 hPa lower. The typical peak ozone value, although at a higher altitude than the ledge, appears at a much lower pressure (approx. 140 hPa) than found in midor low-latitudes (approx. 18 - 25 hPa), Total column ozone amounts are consistently higher than 300 DU. Analysis of the variation with regard to wind conditions will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} the {{variability}} and seasonality of ozone over the tropics was carried out between the regions spreading from Latitude 300 South to 300 North. The region was divided into twelve zones of 50 latitudes each, that is, Latitude 0 - 50 South, 0 - 50 North, 5 – 100 South and 5 – 100 North etc. Secondary data from satellite for each zone was studied both individually and collectively {{for the period of}} 1997 to 1999. The results of the statistical analysis indicated that there was seasonality in time of occurrence of maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>ozone</b> concentration in the tropics. In the northern zones where Nigeria fell, the period of maximum concentration appeared to conincide with the raining season while the minimum with the dry season. The variability of ozone was found to be higher in the high tropical latitudes than around the equato...|$|R
