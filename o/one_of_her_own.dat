5|$|In March 2013, Soule {{launched}} a Kickstarter project {{to fund a}} classical music album called The Northerner: Soule Symphony No. 1, seeking $10,000 for the album. The campaign ultimately raised a total of $121,227. The project features vocals in Old Norse, with Soule citing the successful use of the similar Icelandic language by Malukah in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> projects during development. The symphony has been delayed several times, and is currently scheduled for 2017. For the project, Soule and his company are developing new audio technology.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey {{sailed to}} the aid of troops of the Republic of Korea once more 17 August, {{returning}} to the Kansong area where for four days she provided harassing fire by night, and broke up counterattacks by day, inflicting a heavy toll on enemy troops. She returned to this general area yet again 29 August, when she fired in an amphibious demonstration staged behind enemy lines to ease pressure on the Republic of Korea's troops. The next day she started a three-day saturation of the Changjon area, with <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> helicopters spotting the results: four buildings destroyed, road junctions smashed, railroad marshaling yards afire, tracks cut and uprooted, coal stocks scattered, and many buildings and warehouses set blazing.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Peter {{begins to}} insult Lois about her {{advancing}} age, including her minor strands of gray hair. This makes her extremely self-conscious, and soon Lois {{becomes aware of}} her lust for a younger man. After introducing her new boyfriend, Anthony, to the family, Meg goes on to make out {{with him on the}} family couch, with Lois watching over nearby. Jealous of her daughter's new-found love, she begins hitting on Anthony. Later that day, Lois sends Meg to pick up her grandfather, leaving her all alone with Anthony. The two then begin making out on the couch, but Meg returns to the house only a few moments later and discovers them. Angry at her mother for ruining her chance at having a normal boyfriend, Meg threatens Lois to lay off of him, pulling out <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> teeth in frustration. Lois quickly agrees, but is still angry with Peter for continually insulting her. She confronts him about this, and he admits that he was actually embarrassed about his own advancing age, as well as his lack of fitness, and was only insulting Lois in order to distract her from the fact that she could be with a much better-looking man. He apologizes for his behavior, and Lois forgives him.|$|E

5|$|Rosalind, Perowne's wife, is {{the last}} to arrive home. As she enters, Baxter and an {{accomplice}} 'Nige' force their way in armed with knives. Baxter punches the grandfather, intimidates the family and orders Daisy to strip naked. When she does, Perowne notices that she is pregnant. Finding out she is a poet, Baxter asks her to recite a poem. Rather than <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>own,</b> she recites Dover Beach, which affects Baxter emotionally, effectively disarming him. Instead he becomes enthusiastic about Perowne's renewed talk about new treatment for Huntington's disease. After his companion abandons him, Baxter is overpowered by Perowne and Theo, and knocked unconscious after falling down the stairs. That night Perowne is summoned {{to the hospital for}} a successful emergency operation on Baxter. Saturday ends at around 5:15a.m. on Sunday, after he has returned from the hospital and made love to his wife again.|$|E
5|$|UB-12s {{activities}} {{over the}} next year are not well documented, and no specific record of her can be found in English-language sources. However, it is known that during this period, she was helmed by four different commanders, with the final officer, Oblt. Ernst Schöller, assuming command in May 1918. Under Schöller's command, UB-12 departed Zeebrugge on 19 August to lay mines in the Downs off the Kentish coast, but never returned. According to one British source, UB-12 was herself mined off Helgoland sometime in August. Author Dwight Messimer considers this unlikely given that Helgoland is nowhere near the route that UB-12 could have taken to get to the Downs. A postwar German study concluded the two most likely fates for UB-12 were that she either struck a British mine or was destroyed by <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> mines that malfunctioned during deployment. Messimer also considers it possible that UB-12 may have had a diving accident related to her conversion to a minelayer.|$|E

25|$|After his release, Abu Firas was {{restored}} to {{his position and}} was named governor of Homs, but the situation was rapidly changing: {{less than a year}} after his release, Sayf al-Dawla died, and the Hamdanid emirate of Aleppo began to crumble. Abu Firas quickly quarrelled with Sayf al-Dawla's 15-year-old heir, Abu'l-Ma'ali, the son of Abu Firas' own sister, Sakhinah. Overestimating the support he enjoyed among the Arab tribes, Abu Firas revolted against his nephew, but was defeated and killed on 4 April 968 by Abu'l-Ma'ali's general Karghawayh. At the news of his death, Sakhinah was reportedly so overcome with grief, that she plucked out <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> eyes.|$|E

Mistaking her for a princess because of her costume, Naveen promises to give Tiana the money she needs if she turns him human again by kissing him. After some persuasion, Tiana succumbs, but becomes a frog instead.|$|E
25|$|She {{was also}} {{instrumental}} {{in changing the}} kind of programs expected of concert pianists. In her early career, before her marriage to Robert, she played what was then customary, mainly bravura pieces designed to showcase the artist's technique, often {{in the form of}} arrangements or variations on popular themes from operas, written by virtuosos such as Thalberg, Herz, or Henselt. And, as it was also customary to play one's own compositions, she included at least <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> works in every program, works such as her Variations on a Theme by Bellini (Op. 8) and her popular Scherzo (Op. 10). However, as she became a more independent artist, her repertoire contained mainly music by leading composers.|$|E

During this period, Leung had said she was undecided about pursuing an acting career after Harry Potter and wished to attend university to study art and design. In 2007, she helped The Prince's Trust charity of Scotland raise £100,000 by launching a children's art competition and also donated <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> paintings which was auctioned for £960.

25|$|In late May 1842, she {{sailed to}} New Orleans for much-needed repairs with only nine sailors. After {{receiving}} a complete overhaul and recruiting a new crew at New Orleans, the Wharton and Moore's flagship, the Austin {{set out on}} April 19, 1843 again for a cruise off the Yucatan coast. They sailed to Campeche and there engaged the Mexican steam frigate Moctezuma on April 30 in the first Naval Battle of Campeche. Although the Austin and the Wharton succeeded in temporarily driving the Mexican fleet from Yucatan waters, the Wharton {{was struck by a}} sixty-eight-pound shot; two men were killed and four were wounded when <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> guns exploded during the two days of fighting. A decisive second engagement with the Mexican fleet on May 16, 1843, resulted in a clear Texan victory. The Austin and the Wharton left Mexican waters on June 25 and arrived at Galveston on July 14, 1843, effectively bringing to an end the active service of the Texas navy, as the ships would never leave port again.|$|E
25|$|With {{the death}} of Tutankhamun and the two {{stillborn}} children buried with him, the Thutmoside family line came to an end. The Amarna letters indicate that Tutankhamun's wife, recently widowed, wrote to the Hittite king Suppiluliuma I, asking if she could marry one of his sons. The letters do not say how Tutankhamun died. In the message, Ankhesenamun says {{that she was very}} afraid, but would not take <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> people as husband. However, the son was killed before reaching his new wife. Shortly afterward, Ay married Tutankhamun's widow and became Pharaoh as a war was fought between the two countries, and Egypt was left defeated. The fate of Ankhesenamun is not known, but she disappears from record and Ay's second wife Tey became Great Royal Wife. After Ay's death, Horemheb usurped the throne and instigated a campaign of damnatio memoriae against him. Tutankhamun's father Akhenaten, stepmother Nefertiti, his wife Ankhesenamun, half sisters and other family members were also included. Not even Tutankhamun was spared. His images and cartouches were also erased. Horemheb himself was left childless and willed the throne to Paramessu, who founded the Ramesside family line of pharaohs.|$|E
60|$|The object {{for which}} this {{excursion}} was undertaken was twofold--first, to ascertain {{if there were}} any fish in a large lake about ten miles distant from the fort; and, secondly, to give little Edith a drive for the good <b>of</b> <b>her</b> health. Not that her health was bad, but several weeks of bad weather had confined her much to the house, and her mother thought the change would be beneficial and agreeable; and tenderly did that mother's heart yearn over her little child, for she felt that, although she was all to Edith that a mother could be, nature had implanted in her daughter's mind a longing desire for the companionship <b>of</b> little <b>ones</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> age, which could not be satisfied by any substitute--not even that of a tender mother, who sought, by all the means in her power, to become a child again for Edith's sake.|$|R

The song, {{written and}} {{produced}} by Swift with Nathan Chapman, was released as a promotional single on October 5, 2010, by Big Machine Records from her 2010 album of the same name. Swift wrote the song about interrupting a wedding, after conversing with her friend, whose ex-boyfriend would soon wed to someone else, and having a dream about <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> ex-boyfriends marrying another girl. The song relies on acoustic guitar and is a narration {{from the perspective of}} a person who crashes her former love's wedding in attempt to win him back.|$|E

Lady Gregory did not think as highly of the play as Yeats did, but she defended Synge as a matter of principle. Her view of the affair is summed up in a letter to Yeats where she wrote of the riots: [...] "It is the old battle, between those who use a toothbrush and those who don't." ...|$|E

The Houston Chronicle critic Joey Guerra called the song a [...] "blast of energy", but observed that it is [...] "too reminiscent of past Ciara/Elliott hits". Guerra said that [...] "A little variation would have made for a more dynamic tune." [...] Andy Kellman of Allmusic was more critical and called the song an [...] "over-stuffed dancefloor mess that does not benefit from Missy Elliott's hoarse hectorin". Jordan Sargent of PopMatters considered the song a letdown due to Ciara's [...] "lifeless" [...] vocal delivery. Dan Gennoe of Yahoo!

That night, Swift experienced a dream where <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> ex-boyfriends married another girl. To her, this signaled that she had to compose a song about interrupting a wedding. In retrospect, she concluded, [...] "For me, I like {{to think of it as}} good versus evil.

[...] Swift entitled the album after [...] "Speak Now" [...] because it fit the album's concept, with each song being a different confession to a person.
