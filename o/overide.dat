40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of missile and target {{parameters}} used in second and third order modeling of the tracking subsystem used in radar guided guided missiles. Guidance methods are analyzed to determine which method is optimum {{in a search for}} an ideal missile. Target parameters which {{have an effect on the}} missile tracking system are analyzed and a target acceleration probability model is discussed. A two dimensional third order tracking model is simulated utilizing a Kalman filter for target parameter estimation and prediction. Linear second and third order tracking models are simulated and compared with the third order Kalman filter tracker. This thesis concludes that a proportional navigation guidance method, with a non linear third order tracking Kalman filter, is the better model.

40|$|In {{the world}} of modern {{financial}} theory, portfolio construction has traditionally operated under {{at least one of}} two central assumptions: the constraints are derived from a utility function and/or the multivariate probability distribution of the underlying asset returns is fully known. In practice, both the performance criteria and the informational structure are markedly different: risk-taking agents are mandated to build portfolios by primarily constraining the tails of the portfolio return to satisfy VaR, stress testing, or expected shortfall (CVaR) conditions, and are largely ignorant about the remaining properties of the probability distributions. As an alternative, we derive the shape of portfolio distributions which have maximum entropy subject to real-world left-tail constraints and other expectations. Two consequences are (i) the left-tail constraints are sufficiently powerful to <b>overide</b> other considerations in the conventional theory, rendering individual portfolio components of limited relevance; and (ii) the "barbell" payoff (maximal certainty/low risk on one side, maximum uncertainty on the other) emerges naturally from this construction...|$|E

30|$|In the Tohoku region (northeast (NE) Honshu), NE Japan, the Pacific Plate subducts {{beneath the}} <b>overiding</b> plate. Since the {{boundary}} between the Pacific Plate and the overriding plate is coupled in the shallow region, the continental crust (island arc crust) is deformed under compressive stress in the direction of relative motion of the plate, which is approximately east-west. Deformation of the island arc crust due to this compressive stress can be observed from global positioning system (GPS) data. Figure 1 shows the east-west strain distribution obtained from GPS data acquired by the Geographic Survey Institute and Tohoku University between 1997 and 2001 (Miura et al., 2004). Blue indicates regions of compressive strain and red shows regions of tensile strain. A prominent region of compressive strain can be identified along the Ou Mountain Range (Miura et al., 2002). The existence of this a region can also be confirmed from the distribution of horizontal crustal deformation velocity over the last 100 years (Hasegawa et al., 2000). Several earthquakes have occurred in this zone of concentrated deformation along the Ou Mountain Range, including a number of large ones (for example, the 1896 Rikuu earthquake), as shown in Fig. 1 (a).|$|R
40|$|Early {{exposure}} to androgens {{may be a}} cause of the higher incidence of learning disabilities among males. To test this hypothesis, we determined the frequency of learning disabilities, as measured by extent of Wechsler Verbal-Performance IQ discrepancy, among female patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, who are exposed in utero to excess andro-gens for their sex. A significantly larger Verbal-Performance IQ discrepancy (10. 1 vs 7. 7) was found for the 18 female patients than for 27 unaffected female siblings (P =. 045, one-tailed). The Verbal-Performance IQ discrepancy of the fe-males with congenital adrenal hyperplasia is in the male range (10. 4 to 13. 4), similar to males with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (n = 20) and unaffected male siblings (n = 31). In addition to the sex effect, there is an effect {{of the type of}} congenital adrenal hyperplasia on the frequency of learning disabilities. Simple virilizers {{are more likely to be}} learning disabled than salt-wasters (P =. 04, one-tailed). However, salt-waster patients have a lower IQ (104 vs 117) than simple virilizer patients (P =. 005, one-tailed). Presumably, this is because some salt-waster patients suffer brain injury from episodes of hypotension and hyponatremia.

40|$|This poster {{presentation}} describes the Optical Attenuation Mechanism (OAM) Upgrades to the MOBLAS and TLRS Crustal Dynamics Satellite Laser Ranging (CDSLR) systems. The upgrades {{were for the}} purposes of preparing these systems to laser range to the TOPEX/POSEIDON spacecraft when it will be launched in the summer of 1992. The OAM permits the laser receiver to operate over the expected large signal dynamic range from TOPEX/POSEIDON and it reduces the number of pre- and post-calibrations for each satellite during multi-satellite tracking operations. It further simplifies the calibration bias corrections that had been made due to the pass-to-pass variation of the photomultiplier supply voltage and the transmit filter glass thickness. The upgrade incorporated improvements to the optical alignment capability of each CDSLR system through the addition of a CCD camera into the MOBLAS receive telescope and an alignment telescope onto the TLRS optical table. The OAM is stepper motor and microprocessor based; and the system can be controlled either manually by a control switch panel or computer controlled via an EIA RS- 232 C serial interface. The OAM has a neutral density (ND) range of 0. 0 to 4. 0 and the positioning is absolute referenced in steps of 0. 1 ND. Both the fixed transmit filter and the daylight filter are solenoid actuated with digital inputs and outputs to and from the OAM microprocessor.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation into}} the link between haemodynamics and atherosclerosis is reported in this thesis. A model of a C-shaped tortuosity of the cervical portion of the human internal carotid artery (ICA) was constructed from perspex and {{the flow of water}} through the model studied by dye visualisation and Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA), for both steady and pulsatile flow conditions. Dynamic similarity between water flow in the model and blood flow in the artery was scaled by the Reynolds number and the frequencies of unsteady flow components scaled by the Strouhal number. Dye visualisation results are presented in a series of photographs, which illustrate the flow features in the model at given Reynolds numbers. Several differences from classical Dean-type motions in curved pipes were observed, including axial flow separation, flow asymmetry and an unexpected region of reverse flow, situated at the outer wall of the first bend in the model. A series of axial isovel contour maps were generated from LDA measurements, for planar slices located throughout the straight sections of the tortuosity. These are presented in the form of cross-sections, normal to the pipe's central axis for steady flow conditions, for a Reynolds number of 1500. The contours show the existence of separation regions, bounded by free shear layers, which are located along the walls downstream of the inner bends. Axial isovel contour maps are also presented for planar slices near the walls of the tube, under pulsatile conditions, for a mean Reynolds number of 1500 and a flow variation of ± 50 % about the mean. The flow features were qualitatively similar to those seen under steady flow conditions but the intensities of the separated flows were lower during pulsatile flow than during steady flow. The separation regions were observed to move back and forth along the walls of the tube. Steady flow conditions did not allow the quantitative prediction of the locations or magnitudes of pulsatile flow features at the same instantaneous Re. Shear rates at the walls of the tube were estimated from the contours, giving an estimate of the wall shear stresses. Regions in the model where flow separation was observed, consistently matched reported sites of proliferative atheroma in the tortuous ICA. It is concluded that regions subjected to low mean shear stresses but high fluctuating components of shear stress are associated with the proliferative lesion. Stress fluctuation fatigue of the arterial wall {{may play a role in}} initiating the proliferative lesion, by stimulating reparative processes, as suggested by Stehbens (1979). Pressure fluctuations are also implicated in the etiology of proliferative lesions. Separated shear layers in these regions are thought to be a source of pressure fluctuations, felt at the wall, especially near the reattachment position. Regions subjected to unidirectional, high shear rates, matched reported sites of atrophic atherosclerotic lesions and sites of calcification in early atheroma. The magnitude of the shear stresses in these regions does not appear to be as important, in relation to atrophic lesions, as the presence of a unidirectional shear stress. Stress fluctuation fatigue was not indicated as the cause of degenerative changes to the wall in these regions. A modification has been suggested of the unified hypothesis, described by Steinberg (1983), for the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis, allowing for the action of haemodynamic influences, especially in the initial stages of the disease. It has been postulated that haemodynamic factors may act in three ways: by inducing endothelial injury; by causing stress fluctuation fatigue of the blood vessel wall material; and/or by altering the transmural permeability to macromolecules, in particular low density lipoproteins. The transendothelial transport of macromolecules, in particular Low Density Lipoproteins (LDL's), via pinocytotic vesicles was examined. An exponential factor, allowing for hindered diffusion through the vesicle neck was derived and included into Arminski et al's (1980) equation, describing the permeability of an endothelial cell. The effect of convective perturbations on the observed diffusion coefficient of LDL within the short vesicle neck was found to be negligible. A mechanism for the convective enhancement of vesicular loading is postulated, which depends crucially on the spontaneous curvature of the vesicle wall material. Convective movements through the vesicle neck may <b>overide</b> a geometric equilibrium concentration partitioning effect, which limits the internal vesicle LDL concentration resulting from diffusional loading, to about one third of the plasma concentration. Hence, transendothelial cholesterol transport may be increased by convective loading, in the presence of blood flow disturbances, to 3 times over that resulting from diffusional loading only...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe spindle {{checkpoint}} inhibits anaphase {{until all}} chromosomes have established bipolar attachment. Two kinetochore states trigger this checkpoint. The absence of microtubules activates the attachment response, while {{the inability of}} attached microtubules to generate tension triggers the tension/orientation response [1, 2]. The single aurora kinase of budding yeast, Ipl 1, {{is required for the}} tension/orientation, but not attachment, response [3]. In contrast, we find that the single aurora kinase of fission yeast, Ark 1, is required for the attachment response. Having established that the initiator codon assigned to ark 1 + was incorrect and that Ark 1 -associated kinase activity depended upon survivin function and phosphorylation, we found that the loss of Ark 1 from kinetochores by either depletion or use of a survivin mutant <b>overides</b> the checkpoint response to microtubule depolymerization. Ark 1 /survivin function was not required for the association of Bub 1 or Mad 3 with the kinetochores. However, it was required for two aspects of Mad 2 function that accompany checkpoint activation: full-scale association with kinetochores and formation of a complex with Mad 3. Neither the phosphorylation of histone H 3 that accompanies chromosome condensation nor condensin recruitment to mitotic chromatin were seen when Ark 1 function was compromised.

40|$|Because of an <b>overiding</b> {{focus on}} policy and {{political}} talk, {{rather than the}} underlying social and economic phenomena, scholars typically underestimate the importance of underlying demographics and labour market dynamics on immigration politics in Europe. Despite rhetoric about “fortress Europe” and fears of “floods” to richer nations, flows have generally been demand driven, and have therefore been drawn by European nations with the most open and informal labour markets – such as Britain, Ireland, Italy and Spain – rather than more highly regulated welfare states such as Denmark. They {{are also more likely}} to be circular and temporary than one way immigration. I discuss the desirability of the apparently inevitable trend in Europe towards a more US style international political economy that strongly parallels the migration system between the US and Mexico. This effectively has seen the emergence of a dual level governance system of immigration, in which “smoke and mirrors” style politics talks about controlled policing of borders and migration management, whereas the underlying trends are much less controlled and much more porous. I consider four possible scenarios for this “new migration system”, before concluding with evidence that suggests that the dominant trend in Europe is towards the emergence of a more regionalised system, in which West European societies come to rely on East European movers to fill secondary labour market needs in the service economy – in an exploitative fashion – as well as encouraging a more effective racial or ethnically-based exclusion of migrants from the south or further afield...|$|R

Based on a process of hermeneutic interpretation, I have chosen touse cultural historical theory as an analytic tool. That which I have chosen to call "aesthetic" and "social positions" is discussed in relation to the imperical study.

This thesis describes research which addresses mechanisms for evaluating sustainable development practice by local govemment. A review of approaches to measuring progress, in economic, social and environmental terms, identified sustainable development indicators as an evaluation framework whose applicability to local government warrented further research. A review of research literature highlighted the need for a dynamic and cyclical research approach which would acknowledge the contested and valueladen nature of both sustainable development and the research endeavour. The fieldwork is written up in three stages. The first stage explores the scope for transferring experience from public sector quality and performance indicators work. The second stage is a thin and linear description of the process of Fife Regional Council's role as a pilot authority in a Local Government Board Sustainability Indicators project. The third stage uses the wide range of written and experiential data gathered through the role of Project Consultant/Researcher to the Fife project to present a rich description of 'Sustainability Indicators for Fife'.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is on the {{possible}} effects of cognitive deficit on the acquisition of driving skills in young people with spina bifida and hydrocephalus (SBH). The specific question addressed is whether success on the standard Driving Test can be predicted from performance on a battery of psychometric tests. A review of the findings from studies on cognitive deficit and driving and the cognitive functioning of groups with SBH identified the areas of visual-perceptual skill, attention and memory as being of possible relevance {{in the assessment of}} suitability for driving. The second part of the thesis describes the development of a battery of tests to assess not only these skills, but also visual-motor ability, which, from results during the early stages was also thought to be of value in the assessment of skills for driving. During development of the battery, the perceptual-cognitive tests chosen were completed by two series of SBH adults and by four matched groups of varying ability (able-bodied, SBH, SB only and cerebral palsy). As the work progressed, {{it became clear that the}} prediction of driving success from cognitive tests was limited. However, the results of these studies and a small-scale study of 14 learner drivers during early tuition, highlighted efficient visual disembedding and memory skills as important for learning to drive. Of additional importance was the consistent finding that the reasons why a person did not become a driver had many causes, not necessarily related to cognitive functioning. In particular, financial circumstances, the availability of adapted cars and driving instructor techniques were often <b>overiding</b> factors in determining whether a person reached Driving Test standard or not. No definitive answer, therefore, can be given to the specific question addressed in this thesis - can driving ability be predicted? It is clearly indicated, however, that although sound perceptual-cognitive skills are a prerequisite for learning to drive, they are not alone sufficient to predict driving success...|$|R
40|$|The Beyşehir-Hoyran-Hadim Nappes crop {{out over}} 700 km, {{from east to}} west in the Pisidian and Central Taurus Mountains of {{southern}} Turkey. During this study, field obsevations of lithological, structural and sedimentological features are combined with igneous geochemical data derived from samples collected to help redefine a series of tectono-stratigraphic units and also determine the origin of the Beyşehir-Hoyran-Hadim Nappes. Above a regionally autochthonous Tauride carbonate platform, the Beyşehir-Hoyran Nappes begin with Ophiolitic Melange, consisting of blocks of neritic and pelagic limestone, basalt, serpentinite, radiolarian chert and, in places, amphibolite-grade metamorphic sole-type rocks, together set in a highly sheared siltstone and mudstone matrix. Locally, large slices of serpentinized harzburgite are incorporated in the melange. The peridotite sheets include lenses of chromitite and dunite and are cut by a series of dolerite dykes. The higher thrust sheets in the Hadim area begin with the Korualan Unit; a thrust sheet (ca. 400 m thick) of mainly redeposited carbonates, quartzose sandstones and mudstones of Mid-Late Triassic age, interpreted as a proximal slope/base-of-slope succession. Regionally above is the Huğlu-type Unit; a thrust sheet (ca. 1 km thick) of Mid-Late Triassic intermediate-acidic extrusives, volcaniclastics and minor pelagic carbonates, interpreted as a continental rift. Post-rift subsidence in this thrust sheet is recorded by thin (< 100 m thick) Upper Triassic-Upper Cretaceous pelagic carbonate and radiolarian chert, depositionally above. The uppermost thrust sheet, the Boyali Tepe-type Unit, comprises broken formation and melange, including Jurassic shallow-water carbonate, Ammonitico Rosso condensed pelagic limestone, radiolarian chert and Upper Cretaceous pelagic limestone, representing a Bahaman-type carbonate platform which subsided in Early Jurassic time. Anastomosing zones of tectonic-sedimentary melange separate these higher units. The Beyşehir-Hoyran Nappes document Triassic rifting and Jurassic-Cretaceous passive margin subsidence bordering the Northern Neotethyan Ocean. The Late Cretaceous harzburgitic ophiolite probably formed above a northerly dipping subduction zone within the Neotethyan ocean basin. Ophiolitic melange formed along {{the leading edge of the}} <b>overiding</b> plate. The ophiolite was emplaced southwards onto the northern margin of the Tauride platform in latest Cretaceous time, probably during collision of the passive margin with a trench. The nappe pile and underlying platform (Hadim Nappe) were thrust ca. 150 km further south in Late Eocene time during regional continental collision and suture zone tightening. Several alternative palaeo-tectonic models are considered and tested in the light of data presented from this study. Assuming ‘in-sequence’ thrusting, the Beyşehir-Hoyran Nappes restore to a location north of a northerly Neotethyan spreading axis. More probably, they originated near the south margin of the northern Neotethys, but reached their position by ‘out-of-sequence thrusting’. Formation within a localised southerly strand of the northern Neotethys (Inner Tauride ocean) is more probable than within the main Neotethys further north. Wider implications for the Tethyan ocean as a whole and several other orogenic belts are also considered...|$|R
40|$|Recently {{there has}} been focus on {{determining}} the drying behaviour of particulate material at low moisture contents (< 1 %), {{as a result of}} increased energy costs and purity requirements for dried products. As little is known about. the drying behaviour of particulate material at these low moisture levels, driers have been oversized by including large safety factors in the sizing calculations, thus incurring unnecessary capital expenditure. A research programme was formulated in an attempt to provide a greater understanding of the moisture movement processes occurring at these low moisture levels. The results of this work indicate the significant effects that influence the drying behaviour of particulate material, which may be implemented into drier sizing calculations. Most particulate materials require a significant amount of energy to remove residual amounts of moisture, particularly from microporous media or from strongly hydrophilic surfaces. Quantifying the energy required to remove this bound moisture is possible from a knowledge of heats of wetting as a function of moisture content. These can be calculated from isotherms under controlled conditions using the Clausius-Claperyon equation. As part of a research programme to look at this type of drying behaviour, a novel apparatus was designed and constructed. The function of this apparatus was to record drying profiles of particulate material under various drying conditions and sample sizes. The sensitivity and reproducibility of the drying profiles were the <b>overiding</b> parameters in the design of such an apparatus. Moisture movement at low moisture levels in thin layers and single particulate arrangements can be described by two mechanisms. Solute bound to hydrophilic and/or active pore surfaces requires a normally distributed activation energy to be overcome, for surface diffusion to occur. Solute held in "water clusters" by hydrophobic media, such as polymeric, some plastic and generally swelling solids, can be described by Fickian movement similar to the familiar transport processes known to occur at higher moisture contents. Thus, it is possible to extrapolate the drying kinetics at higher moisture contents to lower-moisture contents in this instance, but not for the surface diffusion process which takes place only at lower moisture levels. For the drying of thicker layers and beds of particles, accurate overall diffusion coefficients need to include a gas phase diffusion term for gaseous movement through the particulate bed. The studies here have extended the understanding of the drying kinetics dissimilarities between drying single isolated particles, single particle agglomerates, thin layers and beds of particulate material. In sizing calculations of drying units, preliminary kinetics tests on the material to be dried need to be performed under similar bed geometries to that in the full-scale drying unit. For example, thin-layer experiments appear to provide accurate drying kinetic data for the design of cascade rotary driers. The thickness of the thin layer in the drying kinetic tests is determined by the observed thickness of the falling film of material during operation of the cascade rotary drier. Higher gas velocities in a fluidised bed, or flash driers, may be best modelled by drying kinetics studies on single particles or single particle agglomerates. However, at lower gas velocities, thin-layer tests may be more suitable because the drying material in the fluidised bed may dry in a bubbling motion. The final section of this work looked at selective drying of various isopropyl alcohol/water mixtures at low moisture levels. Selective drying at higher moisture contents is generally well understood, by applying azeotropic principles to describe liquid-phase moisture removal from porous matrices. Two-component bound moisture in a porous particulate resides in a solid phase. It is not possible for a binary mixture bound directly to the solid to form an azeotropic mixture. Modelling the removal of this binary bound moisture was shown to fit a surface diffusion model, in which each of the two solvents was treated as a separate entity. In short, selective drying is prevalent at low moisture contents but can be described by two distinct surface diffusion models working independently on each binary species...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} research paper {{was concerned with}} five basic objectives:(1) outlining the major theoretical and methodological approaches used in the reconstruction of early hominid social behavior/social structure as {{a context in which}} to view Richard Wrangham's and Michael Ghiglieri's phylogenetic models of stem-hominid social structure. (2) examining Wrangham's and Ghiglieri's models of stem-hominid and chimpanzee social structure. (3) indicating how theoretical and methodological aspects of structure essentially represent an extension of the theoretical and methodological approaches the same researchers applied to their models of chimpanzee social structure. (4) addressing the theoretical and methodological deficiences of Wrangham's and Ghiglieri's models of chimpanzee social structure. (5) providing suggestions for improved phylogenetic models of early hominid social structure. The first objective was achieved by: (a) reviewing Tooby and Devore's (1986) and Wrangham's (1986) evaluations of the major theoretical approaches and methodologies used in the reconstruction of hominid social behavior/structure (b) defining, classifying and evaluating Wrangham's and Ghiglieri's phylogenetic approaches within this context. The second objective was accomplished by outlining, analyzing, and comparing/contrasting Wrangham's and Ghiglieri's phylogenetic models of stem-hominid social structure (i. e. Wrangham 1986; Ghiglieri 1987, 1989) and Wrangham's and Ghiglieri's models of chimpanzee social structure (i. e. Wrangham 1975, 1979; Ghiglieri 1984, 1985, 1987, 1989). The third objective was achieved by recognizing how Wrangham and Ghiglieri used/stressed principles and concepts derived from evolutionary biology and/or behavioral ecology to develop their models of stem-hominid and chimpanzee social structure. This analysis showed that Wrangham's models of social structure were more favorably inclined toward the method of behavioral ecology than Ghiglieri's models, which favored a sociobiological paradigm. Furthermore, although neither researcher relied exclusively on the above theoretical approaches, the main thrust of their argument often centered around it. For instance, Wrangham's analysis of chimpanzee social structure (Wrangham 1975, 1979) indicated that the ultimate cause of that structure was ecological i. e., patchy food distribution leads to wide female dispersal for optimal foraging efficiency, which in turn favors a male kin breeding group that can maintain a territority that includes several individual female ranges. In contrast, Wrangham's phylogenetic model of the social structure of the stem-hominid (Wrangham, 1986) suggested that phylogenetic inertia may be partially responsible for the shared social features found among African Hominoidea. However, in the same work, Wrangham also suggested that further socioecological analysis of African apes may indicate whether food distribution and its effects on female dispersion/association may partially explain conservative African ape social features. Ghiglieri's phylogenetic model of the stem-hominid (1987, 1989), on the other hand, explained the conservative social features of bonobos, common chimpanzees, and hominids to be primarily a product of phylogenetic inertia and sexual selection. Furthermore, for Ghiglieri the most important sexual selection variable was a male communal reproductive strategy. This, according to Ghiglieri, is the ultimate cause of social structure. Notably, Ghiglieri (1984, 1985) had earlier stressed the <b>overiding</b> importance of a male communal reproductive strategy but was less dogmatic in his insistence that chimpanzees had essentially solved their ecological problems (e. g. that they had solved the food distribution problem by fusion-fission sociality; predators were never a real problem). Nevertheless, Ghiglieri's earlier position similarily expressed the idea that a communal reproductive strategy constituted the ultimate cause of social structure. The fourth objective was accomplished by presentation of an alternative model of chimpanzee social behavior which suggested that structure; the effect of phylogenetic inertia on social structure; chimpanzee social structure is the combined product of ecological and sexual selection forces: female optimal foraging, male mating strategies, and predator pressure. The model was considered by the author to be unique in that it integrated essential aspects of both Wrangham's and Ghiglieri's models and, in addition, provided support for Alexander's (1974) contention that predation pressure is an ultimate cause of ape social structure. The model also outlined scenarios for the evolution of chimpanzee group. _ extensibility (fusion-fission sociality) and the capacity for warfare among chimpanzees. The last objective was achieved by a discussion of the implications that the author's model had for phylogenetic models of stem-hominid social structure. In this discussion the author reviewed the following issues as they related to the phylogenetic reconstruction of hominid social structure: the role of phylogeny and/or ecology in the causation of social encountered when using a phylogenetic referential model for the personal biases that enter into phylogenetic econstructions; pitfalls reconstruction of early hominid social evolution; the significance of chimpanzee models of social structure. The importance of the preceding study lay in its ability to stimulate improved conceptual models of African hominoid social structure. Department of AnthropologyThesis (M. A. ...|$|R
