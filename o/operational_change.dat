50|$|Following Brian Noble's {{move from}} the Bradford Bulls to the Wigan Warriors in 2006, his third full season at the club took place in 2009.

50|$|Via Rail {{was created}} in 1978 and took over the {{responsibility}} for operating intercity passenger trains of both Canadian National CN) and CPR. During Via's first months there was no <b>operational</b> <b>change</b> for CPR or CN trains, as they used their respective crews, routes, equipment and stations. However, {{by the summer of}} 1979, the integration process began, and most of Via's former CP trains that used Windsor Station were consolidated at CN's Central Station, including CP's former transcontinental passenger services such as The Atlantic Limited and The Canadian, both of which were also renamed to be bilingually appropriate. Via Dayliners (Budd Rail Diesel Cars) operating between Windsor Station and St. Sacrement station in Quebec City via the CP route north of the St. Lawrence River continued to use Windsor Station until 1984. Amtrak's daily Montreal-New York City train (the Adirondack) continued to use Windsor Station until 1986. Both the dayliners and the Adirondack were switched to Central Station. Local services to Ottawa via Montebello and to Mont-Laurier, both of which had been transferred from CPR to Via, continued to use Windsor Station until they were cancelled in 1981.|$|E

40|$|Long-term {{demand for}} freight and {{passenger}} rail traffic in North America is expected to expand increasingly leading to capacity constraints. Both infrastructure investment and <b>operational</b> <b>changes</b> can relieve congestion. However, given the high cost to build and maintain infrastructure, careful consideration of how operational practices can affect or mitigate demand is critical for cost-effective planning of new capacity. A key aspect {{of this is the}} effect of heterogeneous traffic characteristics on capacity. Different {{freight and passenger}} trains have substantially different operating characteristics including: speed, acceleration, braking and dispatching priorities. Greater heterogeneity on a line increases interference between trains and creates more delays than if all trains have similar characteristics. Train dispatching simulation software was used to analyze the impact of heterogeneity under a range of realistic infrastructure configurations and operational conditions. Analyses were conducted {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} various <b>operational</b> <b>changes</b> to reduce delays. The trade-off between reduced congestion and increased cost was considered for each change. A benefit of <b>operational</b> <b>changes</b> is that they can be more rapidly implemented and offer greater flexibility than capital infrastructure investments if future traffic patterns change...|$|R
