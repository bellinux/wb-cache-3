5|$|A Television Infrared <b>Observation</b> <b>Satellite</b> (TIROS) {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} a tropical disturbance east of the Leeward Islands on September28. A reconnaissance aircraft flight into a system on the following day indicated that a tropical depression developed near 14.5°N, 48.9°W. The depression initially moved west-northwestward and remained disorganized for several days. In {{the early stages of the}} depression, the system appeared to have been located under minor vortices in the upper atmosphere, located within a strong easttowest oriented trough. Approaching the Lesser Antilles, the system curved northwestward between two high pressure areas on September30 and avoided landfall in the islands. By October2, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Daisy. The trough dissipated on the following day, causing Daisy to resume its initial west-northwest motion. The storm intensified into a Category1 hurricane later on October3. Further deepening occurred, and by October5, Daisy became a Category2 hurricane.|$|E
5|$|On September10, the Television Infrared <b>Observation</b> <b>Satellite</b> {{observed}} {{an area of}} convection, or thunderstorms, to {{the southwest}} of the Cape Verde islands, suggesting the possibility of tropical cyclogenesis. At 18:00UTC that day, a tropical depression formed and subsequently moved on a northwest trajectory. By the time the Hurricane Hunters reached the system on September12, winds of hurricane force were recorded, and as such, the San Juan, Puerto Rico Weather Bureau began issuing warnings on Hurricane Esther. It was later estimated that the system attained tropical storm status on September 11, although the National Hurricane Center later noted {{that it could have}} attained hurricane status by this date, thus potentially being one of four simultaneous hurricanes, along with hurricanes Betsy, Carla, and Debbie. The only other such occasions were in 1893 and 1998. This also made Esther the first hurricane to be discovered by satellite imagery, although not the first to be imaged by one.|$|E

40|$|The {{vulnerability}} of Africa {{to the impact}} of climate change, which results in natural disasters and environmental degradation, accelerates hardship and poverty for millions of Africans. However, Africa still lacks the necessary scientific and technical capacity to assess fully and to monitor the possible future impacts of climate change. One of the instruments available to address the challenges of environmental monitoring (including climate change) and to provide early warnings of natural and human-made disasters for Africa's development is Earth <b>observation</b> <b>satellites.</b> Earth <b>observation</b> <b>satellites</b> record Earth's information from space and provide accurate, continuous, simultaneous measurements of our planet. The results of the application of Earth <b>observation</b> <b>satellites</b> have long term social benefits which include the early detection of hurricanes and typhoons that can lead to prompt warnings for areas predicted to be affected, thus providing crucial time to implement safety measures to mitigate the effects of such disasters. Several authors concur with this position, stating that the global view from <b>satellite</b> <b>observation</b> is unmatched in its ability to capture the dynamics and variability of Earth processes. The capability to predict weather (among other things) has led Earth <b>observation</b> <b>satellites</b> to become essential to everyday applications that improve human safety and quality of life. However, despite the many benefits of the use of Earth <b>observation</b> <b>satellites,</b> it still remains a major challenge for Africa to explore the full potential of Earth <b>observation</b> <b>satellites</b> in addressing continental needs (Figure 1).

25|$|Earth's surface albedo is {{regularly}} estimated via Earth <b>observation</b> <b>satellite</b> sensors such as NASA's MODIS instruments {{on board the}} Terra and Aqua satellites, and the CERES instrument on the Suomi NPP and JPSS. As the amount of reflected radiation is only measured for a single direction by satellite, not all directions, a mathematical model is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of directional-hemispherical reflectance and bi-hemispherical reflectance (e.g.,). These calculations {{are based on the}} bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), which describes how the reflectance of a given surface depends on the view angle of the observer and the solar angle. Thereby, the BRDF allows to translate observations of reflectance into albedo.|$|E
25|$|Side looking {{airborne}} radar (SLAR) {{made it possible}} to acquire images regardless of weather conditions. On November 4, 1995, Canada launched RADARSAT-1. Developed by the Canadian Space Agency, it provides images of Earth for scientific and commercial purposes. This system was the first to use synthetic aperture radar (SAR), which sends microwave energy to the ocean surface and records the reflections to track icebergs. The European Space Agency launched ENVISAT (an <b>observation</b> <b>satellite</b> that orbits the Earth's poles) on March 1, 2002. ENVISAT employs advanced synthetic aperture radar (ASAR) technology, which can detect changes in surface height accurately. The Canadian Space Agency launched RADARSAT-2 in December 2007, which uses SAR and multi-polarization modes and follows the same orbit path as RADARSAT-1.|$|E

500|$|A weak circulation, {{associated}} with a tropical wave, was first observed by Television Infrared <b>Observation</b> <b>Satellite</b> (TIROS) in the eastern Atlantic Ocean on August14. The system tracked westward and was observed by a research flight on August18. Four days later, the system entered the Caribbean Sea and continued to remain disorganized. The wave moved across eastern Cuba on August24, before emerging into the Straits of Florida on the following day. The system finally began to organize, and at 1200UTC on August26, a tropical depression developed offshore southeastern Florida coast. Shortly thereafter, the depression made landfall near Boca Raton, Florida with winds of 30mph (45km/h). It traveled barely inland and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean near Fort Pierce early on August27. The depression moved northeastward and strengthened due to its location beneath an anticyclone. Later on August27, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Alma while situated about [...] east of the FloridaGeorgia border.|$|E

Hurricane Faith curved to the northwest and weakened back to a Category1 hurricane while approaching the northeastern Leeward Islands on August25. Initially, Faith was scheduled to be seeded as part of Project Stormfury. However, the scheduled seeding was cancelled as Faith was approaching The Bahamas. Bypassing the Leeward Islands, Faith remained at nearly the same intensity, until re-strengthening into Category2 hurricane on August28, near Turks and Caicos Islands. The storm quickly intensified further into a Category3 hurricane only six hours later.|$|E
