Titled: [...] "From Page to Screen: Character and Creature Design of Neville Page", featuring works by Page, including pencil drawings, three-dimensional models, and digital creations. Page {{said he hoped}} the exhibit would {{educate the public about}} a different facet to filmmaking, [...] "The general public tends to associate films with actors versus people who conceive and design and make the films. What is on display is one small facet <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> to make a movie, one of the many gears involved in the mechanism, neither more important nor less ... simply as important." ...|$|E
500|$|David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle {{gave the}} program a rave review and saying that, [...] " [...] good you can't help {{wondering}} {{why no one}} thought of it before, a compelling mix of credible real-life melodrama with a fictionalized approximation <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> to get a Broadway show from the idea stage to opening night. Robert Bianco of USA Today wrote that [...] "Unless you're allergic to musicals in general and Broadway in particular, you should find that a compelling central story, a strong cast, an out-of-the-procedural-mold premise and some rousing, roof-raising numbers more than compensate for any lingering problems." [...] He ultimately gave it {{three and a half}} stars out of four. The A.V. Club reviewer Noel Murray praised the cast and Eileen's divorce storyline. He mainly criticized the staging and arrangement of the musical numbers saying they threatened the realism of the show and wrote they weren't completely [...] "digetic". He ultimately gave the episode a B. Another A.V. Club reviewer Todd VanDerWerff criticized the series for not avoiding clichés but also wrote [...] "the show is so damned sincere about how much it embraces the clichés of the backstage Broadway story that those inclined to like this sort of thing—and I'm very much one of them—will forgive it some of these excesses." [...] He also criticized the adoption storyline. Despite this, he went on to compare the series to Hill Street Blues, ER and The West Wing.|$|E

His combat duty began when he was 30years old in mid-1967, when Forrestal was assigned to a bombing campaign, Operation Rolling Thunder, during the Vietnam War. Stationed in the Gulf of Tonkin, McCain and his fellow pilots became frustrated by micromanagement from Washington, and he would later write that [...] "In all candor, we thought our civilian commanders were complete idiots who didn't have the least notion <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> to win the war." ...|$|R
2500|$|Reflecting in 1993 on his {{relatively}} late {{start in}} writing fiction, DeLillo said [...] "I wish I had started earlier, but evidently I wasn’t ready. First, I lacked ambition.

Second, I didn’t have a sense <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> {{to be a serious}} writer. It {{took me a long time}} to develop this." ...|$|E

2500|$|Critics' {{reviews of}} From the Sky Down were mixed. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an {{enthusiastic}} review, describing it as [...] "one {{of the most}} transcendent close-up looks at {{the process of creating}} rock & roll I've ever seen." [...] In his opinion, the film was a [...] "stirring testament to what it really means when four people in this world can create magical things because they band together." [...] Hank Steuver of The Washington Post called it an [...] "intriguing" [...] documentary that [...] "becomes a revealing and even enlightening meditation on the mystery of why some bands stay together and some don't." [...] The reviewer said the film is [...] "refreshingly blunt and beautifully assembled" [...] and praised Guggenheim for asking the band tough questions about that period in their history. Brad Wheeler of The Globe and Mail gave the film a three-out-of-four star rating, calling it an [...] "essential companion piece" [...] to the reissue of Achtung Baby. Wheeler wrote that [...] "the process of U2 dreaming itself a new fashion while struggling to get its joy back is tightly and adroitly explored". Radio broadcaster Alan Cross wrote that the viewer will [...] "come out with a new appreciation <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> to be U2". Cross enjoyed the scenes in which the band revisit old DAT tapes demonstrating the evolution of the songs [...] "Mysterious Ways" [...] and [...] "One", along with the animated scenes. Drew McWeeny of HitFix wrote that the documentary is not a [...] "complete record" [...] of Achtung Babys conception, but that it [...] "offers fans a rare glimpse at the process behind U2's music, and for non-fans, it attempts to set a context in which they can appreciate what it is that U2 accomplished". Like other reviewers, he highlighted the scene in which the band revisits the recording of [...] "One" [...] as one of the film's most important. McWeeny ended his review by saying, [...] "This may not be everything I wanted from the movie, but it's solid, and the glimpse we get of real creative alchemy is impressive, indeed." ...|$|E

5000|$|The egalitarian impulse {{encouraged}} {{ordinary people}} to acquire knowledge, but this informed awareness <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> {{to obtain a}} high level of expertise eventually led to a proliferation of medical schools and licensing — that is, to a greater emphasis on credentials. A [...] "dialectic" [...] between the culture of professionalism and the culture of democracy thus shaped 19th-century medicine in America, which throughout the Western world was a time of progressivity in medical science. The same democratic rationality that had provoked skepticism about medical authority became logically allied with advances in science, which in turn undermined appeals to common sense by establishing methodologies of expertise.|$|R

50|$|Verisimilitude (or truthlikeness) is a {{philosophical}} concept that distinguishes between the relative and apparent (or seemingly so) truth and falsity of assertions and hypotheses.

5000|$|The Strike Commander project {{took more}} than four years and over a million man hours on {{background}} development. Very little of that production time turned out to be actually usable in the final product, as at least one and possibly several complete project [...] "reboots" [...] were required to refine the graphical engine to a playable state. Nevertheless, some successful gameplay elements from Strike Commander were re-used by other more notable Origin products such as Privateer and the Wing Commander series. Chris Roberts, in the game's manual, compares the game's long development time with the events in the 1991 documentary Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse, a film account <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> to get the 1979 film Apocalypse Now made.|$|R
