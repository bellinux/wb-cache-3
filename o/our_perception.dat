25|$|Current {{research}} in sensory processing is divided among a biophysical modelling of different subsystems {{and a more}} theoretical modelling of perception. Current models of perception {{have suggested that the}} brain performs some form of Bayesian inference and integration of different sensory information in generating <b>our</b> <b>perception</b> of the physical world.|$|E
25|$|As an example, {{suppose that}} {{light in the}} orange range of {{wavelengths}} (approximately 577nm to 597nm) enters the eye and strikes the retina. Light of these wavelengths would activate both the medium and long wavelength cones of the retina, but not equally—the long-wavelength cells will respond more. The difference in the response can be detected by the brain, and this difference {{is the basis of}} <b>our</b> <b>perception</b> of orange. Thus, the orange appearance of an object results from light from the object entering our eye and stimulating the different cones simultaneously but to different degrees.|$|E
25|$|Although the A-weighting curve, in {{widespread}} use for noise measurement, {{is said to}} have been based on the 40-phon Fletcher-Munson curve, research in the 1960s demonstrated that determinations of equal-loudness made using pure tones are not directly relevant to <b>our</b> <b>perception</b> of noise. This is because the cochlea in our inner ear analyses sounds in terms of spectral content, each 'hair-cell' responding to a narrow band of frequencies known as a critical band. The high-frequency bands are wider in absolute terms than the low frequency bands, and therefore 'collect' proportionately more power from a noise source. However, when more than one critical band is stimulated, the outputs of the various bands are summed by the brain to produce an impression of loudness. For these reasons equal-loudness curves derived using noise bands show an upwards tilt above 1kHz and a downward tilt below 1kHz when compared to the curves derived using pure tones.|$|E

The {{directness}} and vividness of her paintings restored a primitive freshness to <b>our</b> <b>perception</b> of the American scene.

500|$|In The Slave Community, Blassingame uses {{psychologist}} Harry Stack Sullivan's interpersonal {{theory to}} interpret the behavior of slaves on antebellum plantations. Sullivan claims that [...] "significant others", persons with the most power to reward and punish individual behavior, were primarily responsible for determining behavior. Interpersonal theorists argue that [...] "behavioral patterns {{are determined by the}} characteristics of the situation, how the person perceives them, and his behavioral dispositions at the time." [...] The most important component of personality is self-esteem. Blassingame explains, [...] "Our sense of self-esteem is heightened or lowered by <b>our</b> <b>perception</b> of the images others have of us." [...] Interpersonal behavior revolves around the dominant-submissive axes: [...] "One form of behavior tends to elicit its complement: dominance leads to submission and vice versa. The extent of submissiveness often depends on the structure of the group to which the person belongs." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite her {{physical}} {{absence from the}} entry, Cher's presence can be felt throughout the narrative. Negra argues that Cher's [...] "flamboyant and self-authored body" [...] {{is used as a}} metaphor for [...] "the possibility of self-transformation". In addition, her voice, heard via songs like [...] "Walking in Memphis", is associated with the idea of [...] "circumvent patriarchy." [...] Negra notes that Cher's music is used in scenes during The Great Mutato's sexual encounters with women. Negra asserts that [...] "this juxtaposition of sound and image cues <b>our</b> <b>perception</b> that we have entered the realm of carnival where the normal order of things is inverted." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club reasons that the ending was not the actual conclusion of the episode, but rather the fanciful and elaborate happy ending that was concocted by Izzy Berkowitz, the writer of the comic book, after talking to Mulder. In this manner, VanDerWeff notes, [...] "the episode abandons logic and reality and, {{for lack of a better}} word, transcends." [...] Meghan Deans from Tor.com postulates that the entire episode never happened [...] "rom a canonical perspective" [...] due to the entry's comic book setting, the various meta-references and the [...] "happy ending".|$|E
500|$|In early 2003, Nolan {{approached}} Warner Bros. {{with the}} idea {{to make a new}} Batman film. Fascinated by the character and story, he wanted to make a film grounded in a [...] "relatable" [...] world more reminiscent of a classical drama than a comic-book fantasy. Batman Begins, the biggest project Nolan had undertaken to that point, premiered in June 2005 to both critical acclaim and commercial success. Starring Christian Bale in the title role, along with Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, and Liam Neeson, the film revived the franchise, heralding a trend towards darker films which rebooted (or retold) backstories. It tells the origin story of the character from Bruce Wayne's initial fear of bats, the death of his parents, his journey to become Batman, and his fight against Ra's al Ghul's plot to destroy Gotham City. Praised for its psychological depth and contemporary relevance, Kyle Smith of The New York Post called it [...] "a wake-up call to the people who keep giving us cute capers about men in tights. It wipes the smirk {{off the face of the}} superhero movie." [...] Batman Begins was the eighth-highest-grossing film of 2005 in the United States and the year's ninth-highest-grossing film worldwide. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography and three BAFTA awards. On the film's 10th anniversary, Forbes published an article describing its influence: [...] "Reboot became part of our modern vocabulary, and superhero origin stories became increasingly en vogue for the genre. The phrase [...] "dark and gritty" [...] likewise joined the cinematic lexicon, influencing <b>our</b> <b>perception</b> of different approaches to storytelling not only in the comic book film genre but in all sorts of other genres as well." ...|$|E

2500|$|Conversely, some {{research}} has revealed that, rather than music affecting <b>our</b> <b>perception</b> of speech, our native speech can affect <b>our</b> <b>perception</b> of music. One {{example is the}} tritone paradox. The tritone paradox is where a listener is presented with two computer-generated tones (such as C and F-Sharp) that are half an octave (or a tritone) apart and are then asked {{to determine whether the}} pitch of the sequence is descending or ascending. One such study, performed by Ms. Diana Deutsch, found that the listener's interpretation of ascending or descending pitch was influenced by the listener's language or dialect, showing variation between those raised in the south of England and those in California or from those in Vietnam and those in California whose native language was English. A second study, performed in 2006 on a group of English speakers and 3 groups of East Asian students at University of Southern California, discovered that English speakers who had begun musical training at or before age 5 had an 8% chance of having perfect pitch.|$|E

This attention, however, does not operate by clarifying what is already seen, but by constructing a new Gestalt oriented toward a particular object. Because our bodily involvement with things is always provisional and indeterminate, we encounter meaningful things in a unified though ever open-ended world.|$|E

Eventually we fall into a grand chamber whose skylight is fully submerged. The art deco decor, underwater lighting, and skewed angles recall both Bioshock and The Poseidon Adventure.

2500|$|Law of Closure—The law {{of closure}} states that {{individuals}} perceive {{objects such as}} shapes, letters, pictures, etc., as being whole {{when they are not}} complete. [...] Specifically, when parts of a whole picture are missing, <b>our</b> <b>perception</b> fills in the visual gap. Research shows that the reason the mind completes a regular figure that is not perceived through sensation is to increase the regularity of surrounding stimuli. For example, the figure that depicts the law of closure portrays what we perceive as a circle {{on the left side of}} the image and a rectangle on the right side of the image. [...] However, gaps are present in the shapes. [...] If the law of closure did not exist, the image would depict an assortment of different lines with different lengths, rotations, and curvatures—but with the law of closure, we perceptually combine the lines into whole shapes.|$|E
2500|$|Bion {{would speak}} of [...] "an intense catastrophic {{emotional}} explosion O," [...] which {{could only be}} known through its aftereffects.

Hence his injunctions to the analyst to eschew memory and desire, to [...] "bring to bear a diminution of the 'light' — a penetrating beam of darkness; a reciprocal of the searchlight. If any object existed, however faint, it would show up very clearly". In stating this he was making connections to Freud, who {{in a letter to}} Lou Andreas Salome had referred to a mental counterpart of scotopic, [...] "mole like vision", used to gain impressions of the Unconscious. He was also making links with the apophatic method used by contemplative thinkers such as St John of the Cross, a writer quoted many times by Bion.
