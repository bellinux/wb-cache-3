He was {{appointed}} by Pope Paul VI {{as one of the}} four moderators who directed the course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debates,</b> along with Leo Joseph Suenens, Julius Döpfner, and Giacomo Lercaro. Agagianian {{was the only one of}} these four from the Curia, and represented the Eastern Catholic Churches. He had a special role in the preparation of the missionary decree Ad gentes and Gaudium et spes, the Constitution on the Church in the Modern World.|$|E
5|$|Debates {{about the}} {{national}} flag occurred again in 1917 during the Vilnius Conference. Two colors, green and red, were chosen based on their prevalence in folk art. Artist Antanas Žmuidzinavičius decorated the conference hall with small red and green flags. However, the delegates {{did not like the}} design as it was too dark and gloomy. Then Tadas Daugirdas suggested adding a narrow strip of yellow (to symbolize the rising sun) in between the red (clouds lit up by the morning sun) and green (fields and forests). However, the delegates decided that the matter should be settled by a special commission, composed of Basanavičius, Žmuidzinavičius, and Daugirdas. On April 19, 1918, they submitted their final protocol to the Council of Lithuania. The flag {{was supposed to be a}} tri-color (yellow at the top, green in the middle, and red at the bottom) with Vytis in the upper left corner or in the middle. The Council accepted the proposal, but the 1922 Constitution of Lithuania did not include any mention of the coat of arms. It adopted the national flag that is used today. Any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> failed to produce a historical flag. Discussions of the national flag continued; its opponents considered gold an inappropriate color, since the combination of yellow, green and red did not follow the existing rules of heraldry. However, no changes were made during the inter-war period.|$|E

2500|$|CNN {{was criticized}} for not {{revealing}} during <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> that Keith Kerr, an openly gay military general who had submitted a question and spoke during <b>the</b> <b>debate,</b> was on a campaign advisory organization supporting Hillary Clinton.

25|$|The {{start of}} the 2012 Republican race for {{president}} was shaped by the 13 presidential debates of 2011, which began on May 5.

On December 28, 2011, Johnson withdrew to seek the Libertarian Party nomination and on February 23, 2012, Roemer withdrew to seek the Reform Party and the Americans Elect nomination.|$|E

25|$|On August 21, 1858 {{the first}} of the Lincoln-Douglas debates was held in Ottawa's Washington Park. The site of the debate is marked by a large boulder affixed with a plaque. The boulder was erected on August 21, 1908 by the Daughters of the American Revolution. The day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> 10,000 people flocked to Washington Square. Salesmen sold their wares to the {{mingling}} crowd and excited politicians were canvassing and quarreling throughout the park.|$|E
25|$|Under reforms made in 1999, the House of Commons {{uses the}} Grand Committee Room next to Westminster Hall as an {{additional}} debating chamber. (Although it {{is not part of}} the main hall, the room is usually spoken of as such.) The seating is laid out in a U-shape, in contrast with the main Chamber, in which the benches are placed opposite each other. This pattern is meant to reflect the non-partisan nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> held in Westminster Hall.|$|E
25|$|By far {{the most}} acrimonious <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> has been that {{over the role of}} {{genetics}} in IQ differences, which led to Eysenck being punched in the face by a protestor during a talk at the London School of Economics, as well as bomb threats, and threats to kill his young children. This opposition came when he supported Arthur Jensen's questioning of whether variation in IQ between racial groups was entirely environmental (see Race and intelligence).|$|E

There are different arguments regarding the terminating top of the central structure of Sompur Mahavihara.|$|E
25|$|Boardman {{became a}} member of the State House of Representatives for the period 1803–05 and again in 1816, before {{becoming}} a member of the State's upper house between 1817–1819, and a member of the State Senate between 1819–1821. On March 4, 1821, he was elected to the US Senate while living in Litchfield, Connecticut. He is listed by the Abridgment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Debates</b> of Congress, from 1789 to 1856 as having been present at Senate proceedings on December 3, 1821, in Washington DC in the company of Class-3 Connecticut senator James Lanman.|$|E
25|$|The {{sociology}} {{of law is}} often distinguished from sociological jurisprudence. The latter is not primarily concerned with debates within mainstream sociology and instead engages with some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> within jurisprudence and legal theory. Sociological jurisprudence seeks to base legal arguments on sociological insights and, unlike legal theory, {{is concerned with the}} mundane practices that create legal institutions and social operations which reproduce legal systems over time. It was developed in the United States by Louis Brandeis and Roscoe Pound. It was influenced by the work of pioneer legal sociologists, such as the Austrian jurist Eugen Ehrlich and the Russian-French sociologist Georges Gurvitch.|$|E

25|$|Childers was {{secretary-general}} of the Irish delegation that negotiated the Anglo-Irish Treaty with the British government. He stayed at the delegation headquarters in Hans Place throughout {{the period of the}} negotiations, 11 October – 6 December 1921. However, Childers became vehemently opposed to the final draft of the agreement, particularly the clauses that required Irish leaders to take an Oath of Allegiance to the British king. The Treaty was approved by an exhausted Dáil voting 64–57 in January 1922. In the course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> some felt that Childers had been insulted by Arthur Griffith, and the matter was debated in June. The treaty continued to divide Sinn Féin and the IRA, and Ireland descended into civil war on 28 June 1922.|$|E
25|$|During {{his presidential}} campaign, Ma participated in one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> that {{discussed}} many topics, including environmental protection. The Taiwan Academy of Ecology evaluated {{the policies of}} both candidates Hsieh and Ma, {{and the secretary of}} its workstation in Taipei said that both candidates failed their expectations, but they had more hope for Hsieh than Ma because Ma's environmental concepts lack considerations of reality. In February 2008, several environmental groups created a list of commitments for the two candidates to sign. DPP candidate Frank Hsieh agreed to all the items on the list and signed it in March. Ma did not and emailed the group instead. The Taiwan Environmental Protection Union (TEPU) criticized Ma for ignoring important issues and not having the guts to sign the commitments.|$|E
25|$|Although common {{lawyers had}} begun {{reporting}} cases in England during the 1260s, Fastolf is credited {{as the first}} to report cases in the Rota who can be identified. In the tradition of common law, Fastolf wrote {{a series of reports}} on thirty-six cases heard at the Rota in Avignon between December 1336 and February 1337, constituting a journal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> among the first grade auditors over some two and a half months, the Decisiones rotae. This work by Fastolf was published in Rome in 1475 under the name of Thomas Falstoli, providing a model for the reporting of secular cases in Italy and France, so that reports of cases became a feature of the European jus commune until the time of Napoleon.|$|E
