Although the increased number <b>of</b> <b>keys</b> helps smooth interaction {{with a computer}} there are situations where {{it is necessary to}} reduce the number <b>of</b> <b>keys.</b> The need for reducing number <b>of</b> <b>keys</b> in a keyboard creates a technical contradiction. Generally more number <b>of</b> <b>keys</b> can support more number of functions and less number <b>of</b> <b>keys</b> can support less number of functions. We need more number of functions (all the functions available in a full size keyboard), but we want only less number <b>of</b> <b>keys</b> (Contradiction). This contradiction has been solved by using multi-stroke mechanism. There may be different purposes to reduce the number <b>of</b> <b>keys</b> in a keyboard. Some of them intend {{to reduce the size of}} the keyboard while some others intend to increase the speed of typing. But all of these inventions use multi-stroke mechanism to generate more number of signals from less number <b>of</b> <b>keys.</b> Comment: 8 page...|$|R
