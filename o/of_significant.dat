40|$|BACKGROUND: The role <b>of</b> {{clinically}} <b>significant</b> {{portal hypertension}} on {{the prognosis of}} cirrhotic patients undergoing hepatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is debated. AIMS: In this study, {{our aim was to}} assess the role <b>of</b> clinically <b>significant</b> portal hypertension after hepatic resection for HCC in patients with cirrhosis. METHODS: We assessed the prognostic role of the presence <b>of</b> clinically <b>significant</b> portal hypertension (oesophageal/gastric varices/portal hypertensive gastropathy or a platelet count 100 vs 86 months, P = 0. 742). CONCLUSIONS: Presence <b>of</b> clinically <b>significant</b> portal hypertension has no influence on survival of patients with well-compensated cirrhosis undergoing hepatic resection for HCC...|$|R
5|$|A primary {{pneumothorax}} is {{one that}} occurs without an apparent cause {{and in the absence}} <b>of</b> <b>significant</b> lung disease, while a secondary pneumothorax occurs in the presence of existing lung disease. Smoking increases the risk as do lung diseases including COPD, asthma, and tuberculosis. A pneumothorax can also be caused by physical trauma to the chest (including a blast injury), or as a complication of a healthcare intervention; in which case it is called a traumatic pneumothorax.|$|E

Other NHS facilities in Southcote include Prospect Park Hospital (catering for in-patient mental health and psychiatric intensive care) and the Dutchess of Kent Hospice, which is also part of the Sue Ryder group. The NHS's North and West Reading Clinical Commissioning Group's headquarters is located in Southcote on the Bath Road.|$|E
5|$|All of the wharves {{along the}} coast of Mississippi were {{reportedly}} ruined. In Mobile, Alabama, the storm uprooted trees and damaged several buildings, including a church. Tides rose several feet above normal, flooding low-lying streets such that fishermen were able to deliver their catches directly to market by boat. Some businesses sustained minor water damage, but overall, the city was spared any significant destruction, and received little impact on shipping. To the east, there were unconfirmed reports <b>of</b> <b>significant</b> damage to wharves and warehouses along the Florida Panhandle, but these accounts may have been exaggerated by rival companies.|$|E

5|$|As the 100,000-year {{periodicity}} only {{dominates the}} climate of the past million years, there is insufficient information to separate the component frequencies of eccentricity using spectral analysis, making the reliable detection <b>of</b> <b>significant</b> longer-term trends more difficult, although the spectral analysis of much longer palaeoclimate records, such as the Lisiecki and Raymo stack of marine cores and James Zachos' composite isotopic record, helps to put the last million years in longer term context.
