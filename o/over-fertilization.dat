The GIS approach was used to estimate the NO 3 -N leaching risk to groundwater under efficient irrigation and fertilization scenarios and over-irrigation and <b>over-fertilization</b> scenarios. The results showed that soil texture played a role in NO 3 -N leaching from urban landscapes to groundwater, and shallow groundwater was more susceptible to surface contamination compared to deep groundwater. The GIS technique identified areas where improved irrigation and fertilization management could reduce landscape NO 3 -N leaching significantly, resulting in fewer NO 3 -N leaching risk areas in the Salt Lake Valley, Utah, USA...|$|E
