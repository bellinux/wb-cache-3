The similarity between regions of ozone production and loss calculated using Chapman chemistry and those computed using LIMS and SAMS data with a photochemical equilibrium model indicate that such simplified chemistry is useful in studying gross features in stratospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>balance.</b> Net ozone production or loss rates are brought about by departures from the photochemical equilibrium (PCE) condition. If transport drives ozone above its PCE condition, then photochemical loss dominates production. If transport drives ozone below its PCE condition, then photochemical production dominates loss.

The photochemical point model reproduces the observed NO 2 /NO concentration ratio to within 30 %, and has similar success in simulating observed concentrations of peroxides (H 2 O 2, CH 3 OOH), lending confidence in its use to investigate ozone chemistry.

In this budget analysis, the chemical net production term, which is calculated as the residual of the other terms, displays the correct features of a chemical sink and source term, including location and seasonality, and shows good agreement in magnitude compared to other methods of calculating ozone loss rates. This study provides further insight {{into the role of}} the eddy ozone transport and underlines its fundamental role in the recovery of the ozone hole during spring. The trend analysis reveals that the ozone hole intensification over the 1980 – 2001 period is not solely related to the trend in chemical losses, but more specifically to the balance between the trends in chemical losses and ozone transport. That is because, in the Southern Hemisphere from October to December, the large increase in the chemical destruction of <b>ozone</b> is <b>balanced</b> by an equally large trend in the eddy transport, associated with a small increase in the mean transport.

Long-term exposures of higher plants to low ozone concentrations affect biochemical processes prior to any detectable symptoms of visible injury. On the other hand, the current critical level of ozone used to determine the threshold for damaging plants (biomass loss) is still based on the seasonal sum of the external concentrations of the pollutant above 40 nl l- 1 (AOT 40). Taking into account the stomatal conductance, a more relevant concept is based upon the actual ozone flux in the leaf through the stomata (cumulative uptake of ozone = CUO). CUO however ignores the internal capacity of leaf defense, which led to the concept of “effective <b>ozone</b> flux”, <b>balance</b> between stomatal flux and the intensity of cellular detoxification, with the aim to propose an improved threshold for ozone risk.

The capacity for regeneration of the antioxidant barrier is needed, implying the knowledge of the increased production of reducing power (NAD(P) H), primary supplier for detoxifying processes. It is made possible through the increased participation of the catabolic pathways and associated shunts which can provide NAD(P) H.

40|$|The tropospheric {{level of}} the {{phytotoxic}} air pollutant ozone has increased considerably during the last century, {{and is expected to}} continue to rise. Long-term exposure of higher plants to low ozone concentrations affects biochemical processes prior to any visible symptoms of injury. The current critical level of ozone used to determine the threshold for damaging plants (biomass loss) is still based on the seasonal sum of the external concentration above 40 nlÆl) 1 (AOT 40). Taking into account stomatal conductance and the internal capacity of leaf defences, a more relevant concept should be based upon the ‘effective <b>ozone</b> flux’, the <b>balance</b> between the stomatal flux and the intensity of cellular detoxification. The large decrease in the Rubisco ⁄ PEPc ratio reflects photosynthetic damage from ozone, and a large increase in activity of cytosolic PEPc, which allows increased malate production. Although the direct detoxification of ozone (and ROS produced from its decomposition) is carried out primarily by cell wall ascorbate, the existing level of this antioxidant is not sufficient to indicate the degree of cell sensitivity. In order to regenerate ascorbate, NAD(P) H is needed as the primary supplier of reducing power. It is hypothesised that increased activity of the catabolic pathways and associated shunts (glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase, NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase and malic enzyme) can provide sufficient NAD(P) H to maintain intracellular detoxification. Thus, measurement of the level of redox power would contribute to determination of the ‘effective ozone dose’, serving ultimately to improve the ozone risk index for higher plants...|$|R
40|$|Ozone (O 3) is a {{phytotoxic}} {{trace gas}} in the troposphere where it is photochemically produced from volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO 2). The dominant sink of O 3 in the air over areas with dense plant cover is dry deposition on plant surfaces. However, plants can also contribute to photochemical O 3 formation because they emit biogenic VOCs (BVOCs). In this study, the role of vegetation for tropospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>balance</b> was investigated by considering the following processes: O 3 depletion by dry deposition on plant surfaces, O 3 depletion by gas phase reactions with plant emitted BVOCs, and photochemical O 3 production from BVOCs. Furthermore, drought and heat stress were applied to the plants, and possible impacts of these stresses on plant performance and on the tropospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>balance</b> were investigated. Dry deposition of O 3 was dominated by O 3 uptake through the plants stomata with negligible losses on cuticle and stem. For strong BVOC emitter, O 3 destruction by gas phase reactions with BVOCs was significant at low NOx conditions. Switching from low NOx to high NOx conditions led to O 3 production. A ratio of O 3 formation rates over BVOC loss rates was measured for α-pinene as single BVOC and for BVOC mixtures emitted from real plants. For O 3 formation under BVOC limited conditions, this ratio was {{in the range of}} 2 – 3 ppb/ppb. The ratio of O 3 uptake/BVOC emission reflects the capability of a plant as a potential source of O 3, while NOx concentration and BVOC/NOx ratio determine whether the emitted BVOCs act as an additional sink or a source of O 3. O 3 uptake rates and BVOC emission rates are affected by environmental variables such as temperature, light intensity and stresses to plants. The impacts of them are different and thus the capability of a plant {{to be a source of}} O 3 is also affected by these variables. The focus of this work was the evaluation of the impact of drought and heat stress because future climate change will bring more and intense heat waves and elongated drought periods. With the application of moderate drought, the capability of a plant to be a source of O 3 increased; under conditions of severe drought the impact of plants in the O 3 balance decreased to almost zero. Heat stress also changes the capability of the plant to be a source of O 3. However, this change depends on the basic emission mechanisms of BVOCs and the severity of stress...|$|E
40|$|Odd {{nitrogen}} (NOx = N + NO + NO 2) in {{the polar}} regions is mainly {{produced in the}} upper atmosphere through ionization processes by solar extreme ultraviolet radiation, soft X-rays and high energy particles originating from the space. During periods of high geomagnetic activity, normally close to the solar maximum, energetic particle precipitation (EPP) provides an in-situ source of NOx also in the middle atmosphere. Understanding the behaviour of NOx in the middle atmosphere is of great importance due to its capability {{to act as a}} catalyst in chemical reaction cycles destroying ozone in the stratosphere. This work considers EPP in the form of solar proton events (SPEs). Atmospheric dynamics {{play an important role in}} determining the distributions of long-lived trace gases in the middle atmosphere. The main loss mechanism for NOx is photolysis at the upper stratospheric and mesospheric altitudes, leading to long photochemical lifetime of NOx during the dark polar winter. NOx in the middle atmosphere, also if produced in-situ due to SPEs, is therefore affected by atmospheric dynamics, and transported from the mesosphere-lower hermosphere (MLT) region down to the middle atmosphere. This descent phenomenon can be intensified in the aftermath of sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs), which are dynamical phenomena able to affect a wide range of altitudes in the Northern polar region atmosphere. The enhanced downward transport of NOx can thus strengthen the NOx-ozone connection in the stratosphere. In this work we used both space born observations from several satellite instruments and a chemistry transport model in the examination of the SSW and SPE caused effects in the stratosphere and mesosphere. The scientific objectives of this work were to find out the individual and combined effects of SSWs and SPEs on the NOx and <b>ozone</b> <b>balance</b> in the Northern middle atmosphere, and assess the relative contributions of dynamics (SSWs) and in-situ production of NOx (SPEs) on ozone in the stratosphere. The results showed dramatic increases in NOx in the middle atmosphere, even by a factor of 50, following both periods of enhanced NOx descent in connection with SSWs and in-situ production of NOx due to SPEs. A clear long-term (order of months) decrease in stratospheric ozone (10 - 90 %), coinciding with the enhanced amounts of NOx, was evident and affected mostly by dynamics in the upper stratosphere. The results of this work emphasize the importance of in-situ production of NOx (SPEs) on the <b>ozone</b> <b>balance</b> in the upper stratosphere, but also the key role of dynamics (SSWs) in transporting the SPE effect to even lower altitudes and its capability to strengthen the effect...|$|E

A tethered balloon, fitted with electrochemical and meteorological sondes, was used to obtain detailed vertical profiles of ozone and meteorological parameters up to 1000 m above ground during part of the diurnal cycle (02 : 00 ? 18 : 00 h). VOCs samples were collected up to 200 m by pumping air to canisters with a Teflon tube attached to the tether line. Overall, features of these profiles were found to be consistent with a simple picture of nighttime trapping of ozone in an upper residual layer and of VOCs in a shallow unstable layer above the ground. After sunrise an <b>ozone</b> <b>balance</b> is determined by photochemical production, entrainment from the upper residual layer and destruction by titration with NO, delaying the ground-level ozone rise by 2 h. The subsequent {{evolution of}} the conductive boundary layer and vertical distribution of pollutants are discussed in terms of the energy balance, the presence of turbulence and the atmospheric stability...|$|E
40|$|The {{photodissociation}} {{of ozone}} {{has been studied}} at 193 nm using high resolution photofragment translational spectroscopy. The results show six distinct peaks in the time-of-flight spectra for the O 2 product and its momentum-matched O atom counterpart. The translational energy distributions determined from the time-of-flight spectra reveal {{the production of a}} range of electronic states of the photofragments. The product electronic states were identified based on the translational energy distributions, with the aid of state-resolved imaging experiments by Houston and co-workers. The results reveal the production of a substantial yield of highly excited triplet states of O 2, recently suggested {{to play an important role}} in the stratospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>balance.</b> In addition, peaks corresponding to O 2 (a 1 Dg) and O 2 (b 1 Sg 1) were observed, the latter confirming a previous report @A. A. Turnipseed et al., J. Chem. Phys. 95, 3244 ~ 1991 !#. Evidence was seen for a small contribution from the triple dissociation O 3 ! 3 O(3 P), and insight into the dissociation dynamics for this process was inferred from the translational energy distributions. Branching fractions and angular distributions were measured for all channels. The latter were found in general to yield negative b parameters, in contrast to what is seen at longer wavelengths...|$|E
40|$|Heterogeneous {{chemistry}} of nitrous acid (HONO) on liquid sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4) Was investigated at conditions that {{prevail in the}} stratosphere. The measured uptake coefficient (gamma) of HONO on H 2 SO 4 increased with increasing acid content, ranging from 0. 03 for 65 wt % to about 0. 1 for 74 wt %. In the aqueous phase, HONO underwent irreversible reaction with H 2 SO 4 to form nitrosylsulfuric acid (NO(+) HSO 4 (-). At temperatures below 230 K, NO(+) HSO 4 (-) was observed to be stable and accumulated in concentrated solutions (less than 70 wt % H 2 SO 4) but was unstable and quickly regenerated HONO in dilute solutions (less than 70 wt %). HCl reacted with HONO dissolved in sulfuric acid, releasing gaseous nitrosyl chloride (ClNO). The reaction probability between HCl and HONO varied from 0. 01 to 0. 02 for 60 - 72 wt % H 2 SO 4. In the stratosphere, ClNO photodissociates rapidly to yield atomic chlorine, which catalytically destroys ozone. Analysis of the laboratory data reveals that the reaction of HCl with HONO on sulfate aerosols can affect stratospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>balance</b> during elevated sulfuric acid loadings after volcanic eruptions or due to emissions from the projected high-speed civil transport (HSCT). The present results may have important implications on the assessment of environmental acceptability of HSCT...|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{there is}} a {{widespread}} search for additional heterogeneous reactions or combination of heterogeneous and homogeneous (gas-phase) reactions that could catalytically reduce ozone to observed levels. In 1992, Burley and Johnston proposed that nitrosyl sulfuric acid (NSA) NOHSO{sub 4 }, is a promising heterogeneous reactant for activating HCl in sulfuric acid particles. They list several sources for producing it in the stratosphere and they carried out thermodynamic and chemical kinetic calculations at one stratospheric altitude and at one latitude. NSA has been overlooked in all previous stratospheric model calculations, even though it has been observed in stratospheric sulfate aerosols. This study makes large scale atmospheric model calculations to test the proposal by Burley and Johnston that a promising heterogeneous process for activating HCl in sulfuric acid particles is a catalytic coupled based on nitrosyl sulfuric acid (NSA). This mechanism is examined under non-volcanic and volcanic conditions representative of the recent eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. The calculations set firm limits on the range of kinetic parameters over which this heterogeneous processes would be important in the global <b>ozone</b> <b>balance,</b> and thus is a guide for where laboratory work is needed. In addition, they have derived a preliminary time-dependent integration (1980 [...] 1994) to represent the observed trend in ozone. Comparison between model-derived and the observed ozone trend will be compared...|$|E
