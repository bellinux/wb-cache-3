5|$|Media {{attention}} {{centred on}} sabotage, while other speculation ranged from clear-air turbulence to {{an explosion of}} vapour in an empty fuel tank. The Abell Committee focused on six potential aerodynamic and mechanical causes: control flutter (which had led {{to the loss of}} DH 108 prototypes), structural failure due to high loads or metal fatigue of the wing structure, failure of the powered flight controls, failure of the window panels leading to explosive decompression, or fire and other engine problems. The committee concluded that fire was the most likely cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem,</b> <b>and</b> a number of changes were made to the aircraft to protect the engines and wings from damage that might lead to another fire.|$|E
5|$|The person's {{understanding}} {{of his or}} her mental illness is evaluated by exploring his or her explanatory account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem,</b> <b>and</b> {{understanding of}} the treatment options. In this context, insight can be said to have three components: recognition that one has a mental illness, compliance with treatment, and the ability to re-label unusual mental events (such as delusions and hallucinations) as pathological. As insight is on a continuum, the clinician should not describe it as simply present or absent, but should report the patient's explanatory account descriptively.|$|E

25|$|Whilst {{systemic}} paralysis {{is possible}} in humans, {{it is now a}} relatively rare occurrence. This is because an engorging adult female tick needs to remain attached for several days. This was more likely to occur in the past because there was less medical and public awareness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>and</b> perhaps because it was more likely to be misdiagnosed as 'infantile paralysis' (poliomyelitis or 'polio'). Paralysis is more likely to occur in children and in situations where ticks are attached in places they are not easily detected (e.g. under bandages). Up to 1989, 20 human fatalities had been reported in Australia.|$|E
25|$|In 1970, Mr Jennings again {{raised the}} issue of {{pollution}} through Burton, the River Tame continuing to be a source <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem,</b> <b>and</b> further improvements were promised. The responsibility for sewage treatment works still belonged primarily to local authorities, which often meant an uncoordinated approach and a proliferation of small works. In 1974, these works were transferred to the regional water authorities, with the Severn Trent Water Authority taking over the role for the Trent catchment. This led to increased investment, the closure of older and smaller works, with sewage treatment being combined at larger modern works such as Strongford and Minworth.|$|E

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, feminists and battered women's advocacy groups were calling on police to take domestic violence more seriously and change intervention strategies. In some instances, these groups took legal action against police departments, including in Oakland, California and New York City, to get them to make arrests in domestic violence cases. They claimed that police assigned low priority to domestic disturbance calls.|$|E
25|$|Flying faster {{means that}} the {{aircraft}} passes through the range of a gun more rapidly, {{reducing the number of}} rounds a particular gun can fire at that aircraft. Flying at higher altitudes has a similar effect, as it requires larger shells to reach those altitudes, and this typically results in slower firing rates for a variety of practical reasons. Aircraft using jet engines basically double the speed and altitude of conventional designs, so limiting the number of shells that the chance of hitting the bomber essentially dropped to zero. As early as 1942, German flak commanders were keenly aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem,</b> <b>and</b> expecting to face jet bombers, they began a missile development program to supplant their guns.|$|E

25|$|From {{as early}} as 1535 there were efforts to stop polluting the River Thames in London. Beginning with an Act passed that year that was to {{prohibit}} the dumping of excrement into the river. Leading up to the Industrial Revolution the River Thames was identified as being thick and black due to sewage, and it was even said that the river “smells like death.” As Britain was the first country to industrialize, {{it was also the}} first to experience the disastrous consequences of major urbanisation and was the first to construct a modern sewerage system to mitigate the resultant unsanitary conditions. During the early 19th century, the River Thames was effectively an open sewer, leading to frequent outbreaks of cholera epidemics. Proposals to modernise the sewerage system had been made during 1856, but were neglected due to lack of funds. However, after the Great Stink of 1858, Parliament realised the urgency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>and</b> resolved to create a modern sewerage system.|$|E
25|$|His first {{architectural}} {{projects were}} the façade and refurbishment {{of the church}} of Santa Bibiana (1624–26) and the St. Peter's baldachin (1624–33), the bronze columned canopy over the high altar of St. Peter's Basilica. In 1629, and before St. Peter's Baldachin was complete, Urban VIII put him in charge of all the ongoing architectural works at St Peter's. However, Bernini fell out of favor during the papacy of Innocent X Pamphili: one reason was the pope's animosity towards the Barberini and hence towards their clients including Bernini. Another reason was the failure of the belltowers designed and built by Bernini for St. Peter's Basilica, commencing during the reign of Urban VIII. The completed north tower and the only partially completed south tower were ordered demolished by Innocent in 1646 because their excessive weight had caused cracks in the basilica's facade and threatened to do more calamitous damage. Professional opinion at the time was in fact divided over the true gravity of the situation (with Bernini's rival Borromini spreading an extreme, anti-Bernini catastrophic view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem)</b> <b>and</b> over the question of responsibility for the damage: Who was to blame? Bernini? Pope Urban VIII who forced Bernini to design over-elaborate towers? Deceased Architect of St. Peter's, Carlo Maderno who built the weak foundations for the towers? Official papal investigations in 1680 in fact completely exonerated Bernini, while inculpating Maderno. Never wholly without patronage during the Pamphilj years, after Innocent's death in 1655 Bernini regained {{a major role in the}} decoration of St. Peter's with the Pope Alexander VII Chigi, leading to his design of the piazza and colonnade in front of St. Peter's. Further significant works by Bernini at the Vatican include the Scala Regia (1663–66), the monumental grand stairway entrance to the Vatican Palace, and the Cathedra Petri, the Chair of Saint Peter, in the apse of St. Peter's, in addition to the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament in the nave.|$|E
