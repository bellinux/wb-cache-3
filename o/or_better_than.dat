The chiropractic leaders and colleges have had internal struggles. Rather than cooperation, there has been infighting between different factions. A number of actions were posturing due to the confidential nature of the chiropractic colleges in an attempt to enroll students.|$|E

25|$|Emmel and Perry (2004) {{believed}} {{there to be}} shifts in the relative abundances of the three Orthalicus taxa in the Keys. In the past, Orthalicus floridensis {{was the most common}} and widespread of the three, whereas subsequent to 2000, Emmel and Perry (2004) considered the Orthalicus floridensis to be the rarest. This situation results partly from the translocations that bolstered Orthalicus reses reses distribution and allowed them to avoid extinction, but probably also reflects actual declines in Orthalicus floridensis populations over time. Orthalicus reses reses now occur in sympatry with their congeners in several locations. The observations of Emmel and Perry (2004) suggested that translocated Orthalicus reses reses, all of which are outside the historic range, perform as well <b>or</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> congeners in those places where they overlap.|$|E
25|$|Balance {{and energy}} {{expenditure}} are other great improvements seen amongst patients of gaming rehabilitation methods. Methods such as using the Wii Fit board and Wii Sports games have proven effective at increasing these numbers amongst {{a variety of}} patients. Elderly and cerebral palsy patients have {{been the focus of}} these outputs, as both have the ability to improve these categories of their lives. Specifically, elderly have been shown to display poor balance and mobility due to aging conditions, resulting in a need for rehabilitation intervention and cerebral palsy patients display a combination of poor posture and poor balance which result in a need for therapy, as well. Both, after a period of engaging in a variety of Wii-based games, have shown improvement comparable to, <b>or</b> <b>better</b> <b>than,</b> what they display during regular methodologies, gaining support for these systems.|$|E

25|$|Supporters of the Davis–Bacon Act {{contend that}} these costs {{differences}} either don't exist {{or may be}} justified. One contention is that higher paid labor may be paid more because they have superior skills and are more productive. Under this assumption, a union journeyman would be worth the additional money because he works faster, more accurately, and with less supervision than an inexperienced worker. For example, four union journeyman paid $25 per hour might perform as well as <b>or</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> five entry level workers being paid $20 per hour. Others point out that federal projects {{tend to be more}} complex and require more skilled labor than on either private or state projects. Yet another counterpoint is that by inflating wages, such requirements direct more income into the middle class rather than paying rock bottom dollars to unskilled labor through federal programs while supporting their families through social service programs. Finally, blogger Matthew Yglesias has suggested that because union workers tend to vote overwhelmingly Democratic, and because Democrats favor more federal projects, then Davis-Bacon may actually increase the amount of infrastructure built by supporting those who indirectly vote for more programs.|$|E
