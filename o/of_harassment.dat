40|$|Once unnoticed and unreported, sexual {{harassment}} claims have risen dramatically {{within the last}} two decades. Although guidelines published by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 1980 provided a definition <b>of</b> sexual <b>harassment,</b> researchers continue to examine variables affecting individual perceptions <b>of</b> sexual <b>harassment.</b> Contextual factors impacting the labeling <b>of</b> sexual <b>harassment</b> include the type and severity <b>of</b> the <b>harassment,</b> the ambiguity <b>of</b> the sexually harassing behaviors, and gender differences in perceptions <b>of</b> sexual <b>harassment.</b> The present researcher examined the impact of employee performance and employment status on perceptions <b>of</b> sexual <b>harassment.</b> Results indicated that female participants {{were more likely than}} male participants to label behaviors as {{sexual harassment}}. There were no differences between perceptions <b>of</b> sexual <b>harassment</b> for employees with either good or poor performance records. However, participants were more likely to perceive the employee was the victim <b>of</b> sexual <b>harassment</b> when no employee performance information was presented than when either good or poor performance information was presented.

At the time that Layforce was raised, the British had the ascendency in the theatre, as they had largely defeated the Italians. It was felt that the Commandos could be employed in the capture of the island of Rhodes. However, the arrival of the Afrika Korps in Cyrenaica and the invasion of Yugoslavia and Greece greatly changed the strategic outlook. By the time Layforce arrived in Egypt in March the situation had become dire. The deployment of forces to Greece meant that the Commandos became the only troops in general reserve.

The overall results show that the level <b>of</b> sexual <b>harassment</b> awareness amongst the employees in the said industries is low.

Following the withdrawal, the 31st/51st Infantry Battalion continued fighting along the Ratsua front before being relieved on 28 June by the 8th Infantry Battalion and withdrawing to Torokina, where they remained {{until the end of the}} war. The 23rd Brigade under Brigadier Arnold Potts took over control of the sector, and for a period of four weeks along the Ratsua front the 8th and 27th Infantry Battalions carried out patrolling operations before the Australians decided to withdraw to the Buoi Plantation in mid-July, by which time the Japanese forces in the area, boosted by their victory at Porton, had begun to seize the initiative through the use <b>of</b> <b>harassment</b> tactics.

40|$|This thesis {{highlights}} the importance of workers’ perceptions of and attitudes to sexual harassment. Past researchers have found that a variety of individual factors (age, gender, gender role, and past experiences <b>of</b> sexual <b>harassment),</b> and organisational factors (gender ratio, sexual harassment policies and the role of employers), correlate with the incidence of sexually harassing behaviours. Two studies presented in this thesis extend this research and were designed to investigate how these factors relate to workers’ attitudes towards and perceptions <b>of</b> sexual <b>harassment.</b> Study one investigated 176 workers from a large, white-collar organisation. Study two sampled 75 workers from a smaller, blue-collar organisation. By comparing two different workplaces the effect of the organisational climate was investigated. Individuals from Study two experienced more sexual harassment, were more tolerant <b>of</b> sexual <b>harassment</b> and perceived less behaviour as sexual harassment compared with individuals from Study one. The organisational context was found to affect the way in which organisational and individual factors related to workers 2 ̆ 7 attitudes to and their experiences <b>of</b> sexual <b>harassment.</b> However, the factors that influenced workers’ perceptions <b>of</b> sexual <b>harassment</b> were stable across both studies. Although workers’ attitudes to and their perceptions <b>of</b> sexual <b>harassment</b> were significantly correlated, they were influenced by different factors. Overall, workers’ perceptions <b>of</b> sexual <b>harassment</b> were influenced by their attitudes, the behavioural context, and the gender of the victim and perpetrator. In contrast, attitudes to sexual harassment appeared to be more strongly influenced by individual factors, such as age, gender, gender role, past experiences <b>of</b> sexual <b>harassment,</b> and perceptions <b>of</b> management’s tolerance <b>of</b> sexual <b>harassment.</b> The broader implications of these findings are discussed and recommendations for future research are suggested...|$|R

5|$|On 13 December 1981, {{claiming}} {{that the country was}} on the verge of economic and civil breakdown, and alleging a danger of Soviet intervention, General Wojciech Jaruzelski began a crack-down on Solidarity. Martial law was declared, the free labor union was suspended and most of its leaders detained. Several thousand citizens were interned or imprisoned and much larger numbers were subjected to various forms <b>of</b> <b>harassment.</b> Polish state militia (Milicja Obywatelska, the police) and paramilitary riot police ZOMO suppressed the strike action and demonstrations. Military forces entered industrial enterprises to clamp down on the independent union movement. A series of violent attacks included the pacification of Wujek Coal Mine during which 9 people were killed. The martial law offensive was directed primarily against workers and their Union; they, rather than intelligentsia activists, were the object of the most brutal treatment. The authorities succeeded in imposing on members of Solidarity an individual and collective trauma, from which the broken mass movement would not be able to recover. The Catholic Church strove to exert on Solidarity a moderating influence both before and after the martial law.|$|E
