The Flames were also a poor draw, and never signed a major television contract.|$|E
5|$|Film records survive of two Gettysburg reunions, {{held on the}} battlefield. At the 50th anniversary (1913), {{veterans}} re-enacted Pickett's Charge in {{a spirit}} of reconciliation, a meeting that carried great emotional force for both sides. At the 75th anniversary (1938), 2500 veterans attended, and there was a ceremonial mass hand-shake across a stone wall. This was recorded <b>on</b> <b>sound</b> film, and some Confederates can be heard giving the Rebel Yell.|$|E

Some vehicle filming occurred <b>on</b> <b>sound</b> stages in Brooklyn. The burglary itself takes place during the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, requiring the crew to film parts of the actual parade itself, and then recreate the event one week later for further filming.|$|E
5|$|Due to the Panic of 1819, many {{citizens}} in Kentucky fell deep into debt and began petitioning the legislature for help. The state's politicians {{split into two}} factions. Those who advocated for measures that were more favorable to debtors were dubbed the Relief faction while those who insisted <b>on</b> <b>sound</b> money principles and the strict adherence to the obligation of contracts were called the Anti-Relief faction. In 1820, a pro-relief measure passed the General Assembly providing debtors a one-year stay on the collection of their debts if the creditor would accept payment in devalued notes issued by the Bank of the Commonwealth or a two-year stay if the creditor demanded payment in sound money. Two separate circuit courts found the law unconstitutional {{in the cases of}} Williams v. Blair and Lapsley v. Brashear.|$|E
5|$|Early {{use of the}} NS-10 among {{engineers}} include Bob Clearmountain, Rhett Davies, and Bill Scheniman in the US, and Nigel Jopson in the UK. Clearmountain, then {{a rising}} star in record production, is often credited for {{the popularity of the}} NS-10; Phil Ward, writing in Sound <b>on</b> <b>Sound,</b> suggested that Clearmountain was probably not the earliest, but was certainly the most influential early adopter. It became a legend that Clearmountain had chosen it because it was the worst speaker he could find. He was one of a new breed of creative freelance recording engineers and producers who would travel from studio to studio equipped with their own gear that included microphones, and a pair of Yamaha NS-10, as a reference.|$|E

5|$|On 18 March the PAVN {{had taken}} Phuoc An, {{eliminating}} {{any hope of}} reaching Buôn Ma Thuột. Darlac Province in its entirety then fell under North Vietnamese control. ARVN forces began to rapidly shift positions {{in an attempt to}} keep the North Vietnamese from quickly pushing eastward to the coastal lowlands. In the final analysis, the blame for the fall of the highlands lies with General Phú, who refused to act <b>on</b> <b>sound</b> intelligence and when he realized his error, {{it was too late to}} get reinforcements to the scene.|$|E
5|$|Screenwriters Jeb Stuart, Jeffrey Boam, Frank Darabont, and Jeff Nathanson wrote drafts before David Koepp's script {{satisfied}} the producers. The filmmakers intended {{to pay tribute}} to the science fiction B-movies of the 1950s era. Shooting began on June 18, 2007, at various locations in New Mexico; New Haven, Connecticut; Hawaii; and Fresno, California, as well as <b>on</b> <b>sound</b> stages in Los Angeles. To maintain aesthetic continuity with the previous films, the crew relied on traditional stunt work instead of computer-generated stunt doubles, and cinematographer Janusz Kamiński studied Douglas Slocombe's style from the previous films.|$|E
5|$|V for Vendetta {{was filmed}} in London, United Kingdom, and in Potsdam, Germany, at Babelsberg Studios. Much {{of the film}} was shot <b>on</b> <b>sound</b> stages and indoor sets, with {{location}} work done in Berlin for three scenes: the Norsefire rally flashback, Larkhill, and Bishop Lilliman's bedroom. The scenes {{that took place in}} the abandoned London Underground were filmed at the disused Aldwych tube station. Filming began in early March 2005 and principal photography officially wrapped in early June 2005. V for Vendetta is the final film shot by cinematographer Adrian Biddle, who died of a heart attack on December 7, 2005.|$|E

With two other audio engineers he received an Emmy Award for sound design and sound mixing on Streisand's TV special Barbra: The Concert. Jackson worked <b>on</b> <b>sound</b> design for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney and served as audio director for the opening and closing ceremonies.

5|$|Although {{the first}} scene filmed was the final scene {{to appear in the}} film (shot during the filming of Attack of the Clones in 2000), {{principal}} photography on the film occurred from June 30, 2003 to September 17, 2003, with additional photography occurring at Shepperton Studios and Elstree Studios in London from August 2004 to January 31, 2005. The initial filming took place <b>on</b> <b>sound</b> stages at Fox Studios Australia in Sydney, although practical environments were shot as background footage later to be composited into the film. These included the limestone mountains depicting Kashyyyk, which were filmed in Phuket, Thailand (they were later damaged by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami). The production company was also fortunate enough to be shooting {{at the same time that}} Mount Etna erupted in Italy. Camera crews were sent to the location to shoot several angles of the volcano that were later spliced into the background of the animatics and the final film version of the planet Mustafar.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of 1896, Edison had {{turned his attention to}} promoting a projector technology, the Phantoscope, developed by young inventors Charles Francis Jenkins and Thomas Armat. The rights to the system had been acquired by Raff and Gammon, who redubbed it the Vitascope and arranged with Edison to present himself as its creator. With Dickson having left his employ, the Kinetophone was soon mothballed and Edison suspended work <b>on</b> <b>sound</b> cinema for an extended period. Departing the Vitascope operation after little more than a year, Edison commissioned the development of his own projection systems, the Projectoscope and then multiple iterations of the Projecting Kinetoscope. In 1912, he introduced the ambitious and expensive Home Projecting Kinetoscope, which employed a unique format of three parallel columns of sequential frames on one strip of film—the middle column ran through the machine in the reverse direction from its neighbors. It was a commercial failure. Four years later, the Edison operation came out with its last substantial new film exhibition technology, a short-lived theatrical system called the Super Kinetoscope. Much of the Edison company's most creative work in the motion picture field from 1897 on involved the use of Kinetoscope-related patents in threatened or actual lawsuits for the purpose of financially pressuring or blocking commercial rivals.|$|E

5|$|Glasgow based {{animation}} studio, Axis Animation, assisted 343 Industries on {{the creation}} of CGI cinematics for the Spartan Ops game mode. Axis have produced animations for numerous video games, including the award-winning announcement trailer for Dead Island. To make each Spartan Ops episode as engaging as possible the team at Axis shot and edited episodes in live action using performance capture. The team then used the reference cameras at the live action shoot to create a performance edit, before shooting with CG cameras to provide more coverage of all scenes and a greater selection of shots for the editorial team. The shading team at Axis made use of the 3D animation package, Houdini, to procedurally generate the environment in the cinematics. Axis worked with Glasgow-based audio post production company Savalas <b>on</b> <b>sound</b> design and the final mix for the Spartan Ops cinematics. Facial motion capture was also utilized to take the movements and facial expressions from actors and apply them to the in-game cinematics for both Spartan Ops and campaign. Performance capture for both campaign and Spartan Ops cutscenes was directed and recorded at Giant Studios. Axis worked in conjunction with Giant Studios and Cubic Motion to develop a special facial motion capture solution that would retain facial expressions from the actors when creating the animation.|$|E
5|$|Nightjars have {{relatively}} large eyes, {{each with a}} tapetum lucidum (reflective layer behind the retina) that makes the eyes shine in torchlight and improves light detection at dusk, dawn and in moonlight. The retinas of nocturnal birds, including nightjars, are adapted for sight in low-light levels and have a higher density of rod cells and far fewer cone cells compared to those of most diurnal birds. These adaptations favour good night vision {{at the expense of}} colour discrimination. In many day-flying species, light passes through coloured oil droplets within the cone cells to improve colour vision. In contrast, nightjars have a limited number of cone cells, either lacking or having only a few oil droplets. The nocturnal eyesight of nightjars is probably equivalent to that of owls. Although they have good hearing, European nightjars appear not to rely <b>on</b> <b>sound</b> to find insects, and nightjars do not echolocate.|$|E
