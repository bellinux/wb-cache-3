2500|$|The {{social reform}} of 1933 made it {{possible}} for these institutions to receive up to 50 percent of their <b>operational</b> <b>expenditure</b> from the state. From that point on, the state and the municipalities have gradually obtained the biggest financial and pedagogical responsibility for the administration of these institutions. [...] Financial support was also made available in 1949 for institutions that had not been entitled to it before, as they did not meet the conditions of the act to the effect that they catered to children from disadvantaged families. The pedagogical objective of the institutions was thus recognised.|$|E

In {{order to give}} a general overview, all <b>operational</b> <b>expenditures</b> are classified according to a matrix structure. The most important processes to operate an existing network are indicated. The processes for routine operation, reparation, service provisioning and pricing and billing are discussed in detail. Starting from the description of those processes, {{it is possible to}} derive formulae to calculate the actual OpEx cost for a certain network scenario. The needed methodology is described in the paper. Finally, we indicate how the used network technology and the offered network services influence the overall OpEx cost.

40|$|International audienceThe outage {{of optical}} {{components}} like optical amplifiers and cross connects reduces {{the availability of}} a network and increases the <b>operational</b> <b>expenditures</b> of network operators. Responsible for this is the repair process of optical components which takes very long, because of the large distances in the field. The detection of performance degradation of erbium-doped amplifiers (EDFAs) can be used to reduce the repair time by changing an EDFA before it fails. With the knowledge of the degradation state the remaining life time of an EDFA can be calculated, enabling the operator to plan the replacement of EDFAs to avoid longer outage times. In this paper, an 1, 000 km link and a German backbone network are used to simulate the aging of EDFAs with aging curves. Additionally the <b>operational</b> <b>expenditures</b> are considered to compare the cost of the repair process of EDFAs...|$|R

Total <b>operational</b> <b>expenditure</b> cut were estimated at 6.2% of Estonia GDP in 2009.To increase the state revenue, majority approved income tax cuts were postponed though no new taxes were introduced at that point. However, indirect taxes and charges were increased, for instance, base for VAT were broadened {{as well as an}} increase of VAT from 18% to 20%. Total revenue was about 2.7% of Estonia GDP in 2009.Bank of Estonia has also imposed the requirements to maintain reserve requirements of 15%, having strong bank regulatory and supervisory frameworks that includes capital requirements of 10% (international norm 8%), as well as limited deposit guarantee scheme. In addition to that, deposit guaranty scheme (also known as deposit insurance) has been raised from €20,000 to €50,000 effective from October 23, 2008.
