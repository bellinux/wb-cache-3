When he stops and starts singing, the camera comes into focus and the other band members come out from behind him and start lip-synching his vocals. A group of people (In which {{one of them is}} YouTube star, Wendy McColm) pull up in cars and they also lip-synch the song, in addition to performing other activities throughout the video. The video's effects allow people to seemingly appear out of nowhere throughout the video.|$|E

25|$|Bright field {{microscopy}} is {{the simplest}} of all the light microscopy techniques. Sample illumination is via transmitted white light, i.e. illuminated from below and observed from above. Limitations include low contrast of most biological samples and low apparent resolution due to the blur of <b>out-of-focus</b> material. The simplicity of the technique and the minimal sample preparation required are significant advantages.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{distinction}} between {{two different types of}} third person, the proximate (the third person deemed more important or in-focus) and the obviative (the third person deemed less important or <b>out-of-focus).</b> Nouns can be singular or plural, and one of two genders, animate or inanimate. Separate personal pronouns exist, but are usually used for emphasis; they distinguish inclusive and exclusive first person plurals.|$|E
25|$|Confocal {{microscopy}} is {{an optical}} imaging technique used to increase micrograph contrast and to reconstruct three-dimensional images {{by using a}} spatial pinhole to eliminate <b>out-of-focus</b> light or flare in specimens that are thicker than the focal plane. This technique has gained popularity in the scientific and industrial communities. Typical applications include life sciences and semiconductor inspection. The principle of confocal imaging was invented and patented by Marvin Minsky in 1957.|$|E
25|$|Tarantula Nebula {{is in the}} Large Magellanic Cloud, {{named for}} its spiderlike shape. It is also {{designated}} 30 Doradus, as it is {{visible to the naked}} eye as a slightly <b>out-of-focus</b> star. Larger than any nebula in the Milky Way at 1000 light-years in diameter, it is also brighter, because it is illuminated by the open star cluster NGC 2070, which has at its center the star cluster R136. The illuminating stars are supergiants.|$|E
25|$|The Return of the King {{was shot}} during 2000, though Astin's {{coverage}} from Gollum's attempt to separate Frodo and Sam was filmed on 24 November 1999, when floods in Queenstown interrupted {{the focus on}} The Fellowship of the Ring. Some of the earliest scenes shot for the film were in fact the last. Hobbiton, home of the Hobbits, was shot in January 2000 with early scenes from The Fellowship of the Ring, with the exterior shot at a Matamata farm, while interior scenes shot at Stone Street Studios in Wellington, shared with the Grey Havens sequence. Due to the high emotions of filming the scene, the cast were in despair when {{they were required to}} shoot it three times, due to a continuity flaw in Sean Astin's costume, and then negatives producing <b>out-of-focus</b> reels. Also shared with the previous films was the Rivendell interior in May.|$|E
500|$|On 22 March 2011, a short scene {{serving as}} a prequel for the first episode was {{released}} on the programme's website. In the prequel, Nixon receives {{a phone call from}} the little girl who keeps calling him in the episode. She begs for the President to look behind him, but he asks how she got that number, which the 'spaceman' told her. She tells him it is about monsters, to which he replies [...] "Young lady, there are no monsters in the Oval Office." [...] He then hangs up and leans back. Behind him stands an <b>out-of-focus</b> Silent.|$|E
500|$|The {{exact nature}} of the {{substance}} that is deposited on Michael's carpet is never explicitly made clear. Fischer only described it as [...] "soft [...] smelly [...] brown". In fact, the circumstance in which the substance is viewed by the camera is still ambiguous; Television Without Pity reviewer M. Giant noted that the viewer only gets [...] "the merest <b>out-of-focus</b> Blair Witch glimpse" [...] of the substance. Fischer also noted {{that one of the}} more interesting aspects of the episode was the [...] "you [...] finally see Pam and Roy getting along." [...] She explained that this was because Roy and Pam returned from [...] "a romantic vacation in the Poconos." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{filming the}} {{introductory}} scene of Karthik's character, Manohar, Sreeram {{had to lie}} on a bed sheet to film. The crew pulled the sheet, with Sreeram and the camera. Sreeram made extensive use of frontal and profile close-ups, set against long shots with <b>out-of-focus</b> foregrounds. The scene where Manohar plays a prank on Divya's father at a coffee shop, which later {{became known as the}} [...] "Mr. Chandramouli scene", was shot in Nungambakkam. Filming was also done at Madras' Presidency College, the Schmidt Memorial on Edward Elliot's Beach and at the Madras Literary Society. While filming the [...] "Oho Megam Vandhadho" [...] scene with Divya dancing in the rain, Revathi tied a handkerchief around her wrist to cover her watch because she felt that Divya would actually do that.|$|E
500|$|The band {{wanted to}} build on the textures of The Unforgettable Fire, but in {{contrast}} to that record's often <b>out-of-focus</b> experimentation, they sought a harder-hitting sound within the limitations of conventional song structures. The group referred to this approach as working within the [...] "primary colours" [...] of rock music—guitar, bass, and drums. Guitarist the Edge was more interested in the European atmospherics of The Unforgettable Fire and was initially reluctant to follow Bono's lead to seek a more American sound. The Edge was eventually convinced after discovering blues and country artists such as Howlin' Wolf, Robert Johnson, Hank Williams, and Lefty Frizzell on American public radio stations during the Unforgettable Fire Tour. Despite lacking a consensus on musical direction, the group members agreed that they felt disconnected from the dominant synthpop and new wave music of the time, and they wanted to continue making music that contrasted with these genres.|$|E
500|$|For {{their fifth}} album, The Joshua Tree, the band {{wanted to build}} on The Unforgettable Fires textures, but instead of <b>out-of-focus</b> experimentation, they sought a harder-hitting sound within the {{limitation}} of conventional song structures. Realising that [...] "U2 had no tradition" [...] and that their knowledge of music from before their childhood was limited, the group delved into American and Irish roots music. Friendships with Bob Dylan, Van Morrison, and Keith Richards motivated Bono to explore blues, folk, and gospel music and focused him on his skills as a songwriter and lyricist. U2 halted the album sessions in June 1986 {{to serve as a}} headline act on the Conspiracy of Hope benefit concert tour for Amnesty International. Rather than distract the band, the tour invigourated their new material. The following month, Bono travelled to San Salvador and Nicaragua and saw first-hand the distress of peasants bullied in internal conflicts that were subject to US political intervention. The experience became a central influence on their new music.|$|E
500|$|For the new pilot, Fox made {{it clear}} that they would not air the episodes in the {{widescreen}} format. Whedon and company felt they had to [...] "serve two masters" [...] by filming widescreen for eventual DVD release, but keeping objects in frame so it could still work when aired in pan and scan full frame. To obtain an immersive and immediate feel, the episodes were filmed in a documentary style with hand-held cameras, giving them the look of [...] "found footage", with deliberately misframed or <b>out-of-focus</b> subjects. As Whedon related: [...] "...don't be arch, don't be sweeping—be found, be rough and tumble and docu and you-are-there". Computer-generated scenes mimicked the motion of a hand-held camera. This style was not used, however, when shooting scenes that involved the central government, the Alliance. Tracking and steady cameras were used to show the sterility of this aspect of the Firefly universe. Another style employed was lens flares harking back to 1970s television. This style was so desired that the director of photography, David Boyd, sent back the cutting-edge lenses which reduced lens flare in exchange for cheaper ones.|$|E

2500|$|Where [...] is the {{additive}} noise. Knowing {{this point}} spread function {{means that it}} is possible to reverse this process to a certain extent by computer-based methods commonly known as deconvolution microscopy. There are various algorithms available for 2D or 3D deconvolution. They can be roughly classified in nonrestorative and restorative methods. While the nonrestorative methods can improve contrast by removing <b>out-of-focus</b> light from focal planes, only the restorative methods can actually reassign light to its proper place of origin. Processing fluorescent images in this manner can be an advantage over directly acquiring images without <b>out-of-focus</b> light, such as images from confocal microscopy, because light signals otherwise eliminated become useful information. For 3D deconvolution, one typically provides a series of images taken from different focal planes (called a Z-stack) plus the knowledge of the PSF, which can be derived either experimentally or theoretically from knowing all contributing parameters of the microscope.|$|E
2500|$|Beaton {{attended}} Harrow School, and then, {{despite having}} {{little or no}} interest in academia, moved on to St John's College, Cambridge, and studied history, art and architecture. Beaton continued his photography, and through his university contacts {{managed to get a}} portrait depicting the Duchess of Malfi published in Vogue. It was actually George [...] "Dadie" [...] Rylands – [...] "a slightly <b>out-of-focus</b> snapshot of him as Webster's Duchess of Malfi standing in the sub-aqueous light outside the men's lavatory of the ADC Theatre at Cambridge." [...] Beaton left Cambridge without a degree in 1925.|$|E
2500|$|Jason Lipshutz from Billboard {{found some}} {{similarities}} to Terrence Malick's film The Tree of Life, [...] "with its lingering shots of wholesome Americana, sun-stroked imagery, non-linear structure and contrast between <b>out-of-focus</b> landscape shots and striking close-ups." [...] The video was also compared to Bruce Springsteen's [...] "We Take Care of Our Own" [...] music video, [...] "with its gritty portraits of beleaguered U.S. citizens of every race and creed." [...] Andrew Unterberger from PopDust described the video as [...] "a stately, if somewhat boring, assemblage of nature shots mixed {{with pictures of}} people young and old looking semi-contemplative." ...|$|E
2500|$|In image processing, a Gaussian blur (also {{known as}} Gaussian smoothing) {{is the result}} of {{blurring}} an image by a Gaussian function. It is a widely used effect in graphics software, [...] typically to reduce image noise and reduce detail. The visual effect of this blurring technique is a smooth blur resembling that of viewing the image through a translucent screen, distinctly different from the bokeh effect produced by an <b>out-of-focus</b> lens or the shadow of an object under usual illumination. Gaussian smoothing is also used as a pre-processing stage in computer vision algorithms in order to enhance image structures at different scales—see scale space representation and scale space implementation.|$|E
2500|$|The album's {{lyrics are}} open to many interpretations, which {{alongside}} its atmospheric sounds, provides what the band often called a [...] "very visual feel". Bono had recently been immersing himself in fiction, philosophy and poetry, and came to realise that his song writing mission—which {{up to that point}} had been a reluctant one on his behalf—was a poetic one. Bono felt songs like [...] "Bad" [...] and [...] "Pride (In the Name of Love)" [...] were best left as incomplete [...] "sketches", and he said that [...] "The Unforgettable Fire was a beautifully <b>out-of-focus</b> record, blurred like an impressionist painting, very unlike a billboard or an advertising slogan." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the Governor General prorogued parliament, {{there were}} {{questions}} within the Liberal Party regarding {{the future of}} Dion's leadership and the coalition. In a caucus meeting held the same day of the prorogation, Dion faced criticism for the amateur, <b>out-of-focus</b> video of his {{address to the nation}} and for disallowing dissent once the coalition accord was presented to caucus. Former deputy prime minister John Manley, in an op-ed in the Globe and Mail, demanded that Dion resign immediately as Liberal leader. [...] Leadership contenders Michael Ignatieff and Bob Rae both agreed that Dion had to quit immediately. Dion announced on December 8, 2008 that he would step down upon the selection of an interim leader.|$|E
2500|$|A Christmas break followed, and filming resumed on January 17. Ian McKellen, {{fresh from}} filming X-Men, arrived to film scenes in Hobbiton and the Grey Havens. McKellen {{did not become}} that close to the lead Hobbit actors, as he {{generally}} worked with their scale doubles, but when Christopher Lee arrived in February, they became very friendly. Shooting the fight sequence in the Orthanc interiors, without air conditioning (for atmosphere) but with heavy wigs and robes, was described by the actors as [...] "murder". The Grey Havens sequence, which {{takes place at the}} end of The Return of the King, was shot three times due to Sean Astin forgetting his vest after lunch and, then, an <b>out-of-focus</b> camera.|$|E
2500|$|A {{wide range}} of fluorophores {{can be used as}} labels in flow cytometry. Fluorophores, or simply [...] "fluors", are {{typically}} attached to an antibody that recognizes a target feature on or in the cell; they may also be attached to a chemical entity with affinity for the cell membrane or another cellular structure. Each fluorophore has a characteristic peak excitation and emission wavelength, and the emission spectra often overlap. Consequently, the combination of labels which can be used depends on the wavelength of the lamp(s) or laser(s) used to excite the fluorochromes and on the detectors available. The maximum number of distinguishable fluorescent labels is thought to be 17 or 18, and this level of complexity necessitates laborious optimization to limit artifacts, as well as complex deconvolution algorithms to separate overlapping spectra. Flow cytometry uses fluorescence as a quantitative tool; the utmost sensitivity of flow cytometry is unmatched by other fluorescent detection platforms such as confocal microscopy. Absolute fluorescence sensitivity is generally lower in confocal microscopy because <b>out-of-focus</b> signals are rejected by the confocal optical system and because the image is built up serially from individual measurements at every location across the cell, reducing the amount of time available to collect signal.|$|E
50|$|Bokeh is the {{subjective}} {{quality of the}} <b>out-of-focus</b> or blurry part of the image. Traditionally, time consuming hand computation limited lens designers to correcting aberrations for the in-focus image only, with little consideration given to the <b>out-of-focus</b> image. Therefore, approaching and outside the specified circle of confusion or depth-of-field, aberrations built up in the <b>out-of-focus</b> image differently in different lens design families. Differences in the <b>out-of-focus</b> image can influence the perception of overall image quality.|$|E
