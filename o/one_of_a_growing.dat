A 49 -year-old male with intractable frontal lobe seizures experienced severe ventricular tachycardia following the addition of 400 mg lacosamide to his existing regimen of carbamazepine, lamotrigine, clonazepam, and valproate. The tachycardia occurred during a cardiac stress test; stress tests prior to initiation of lacosamide were normal.

It {{is expressed}} on natural killer (NK) cells and T cells, {{and has been}} shown to inhibit cytolytic functions of these cells upon interacting with its ligand, HLA-B (Bw 4). We demonstrate here that the cytoplasmic region of NKB 1 is capable of inhibiting T cell activation in Jurkat cells. The tyrosine phosphorylation of the NKB 1 KIR consensus motif, YxxL(x) 26 YxxL, induces an association with the protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 C (PTP 1 C). Importantly, mutation of both tyrosines in the motif abolished the inhibitory functions of NKB 1 and abrogated PTP 1 C association. Mutational analysis of the individual tyrosines suggest that the membrane proximal tyrosine may {{play a crucial role in}} mediating the inhibitory signal. These results demonstrate that KIR can not only inhibit cytolytic activity, but can also negatively regulate T cell receptor activation events that lead to downstream gene activation, and further supports a model that implicates PTP 1 C as a mediator in the KIR inhibitory signal...|$|R

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2010. Includes bibliographical references. Biotin synthase (BioB) is an iron-sulfur {{protein that}} catalyzes {{the final step}} in the {{biosynthesis}} of biotin. Specifically, it substitutes sulfur for hydrogen at the C 9 and C 6 positions <b>of</b> dethiobiotin, completing <b>a</b> thiophane ring. It is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ever <b>growing</b> group <b>of</b> AdoMet-dependent enzymes, which undergo multiple one-electron transfers and carbon-centered radical transition states. For the protein to be active, it requires two FeS clusters [...] one oxygen-sensitive [4 Fe 4 S] 2 + cluster that lies near the surface and one reductant-sensitive [2 Fe 2 S] 2 + cluster that is buried deep within the (!") 8 barrel. Study of this enzyme has been fueled by the theory of using inhibitors as antibiotics. Biotin synthase appears to only be found in bacteria and some plants, not in {{any member of the}} animal kingdom. It has been suggested that dethiobiotin derivatives could be targets of resistant bacteria [...] specifically, tubercles bacillus. In order to further promote this research, more information is needed about the mechanism of biotin synthase. In this dissertation, the intermediate state of this enzyme will be examined by three different methods. I will show that 9 -mercaptodethiobiotin is the catalytic intermediate, that single-electron redox changes are occurring in the [2 Fe 2 S] cluster during turnover that parallel 9 -MDTB production, and that the [2 Fe 2 S] is the source of sulfur for biotin...|$|R

50|$|Aboriginal burning {{has been}} blamed for <b>a</b> variety <b>of</b> {{environmental}} changes, {{not the least of}} which is the extinction of the Australian megafauna, <b>a</b> diverse range <b>of</b> large animals which populated Pleistocene Australia. Kershaw (1986), among others, has argued that Aboriginal burning may well have modified the vegetation to the extent that the food resources of the megafauna were diminished, and as a consequence the largely herbivorous megafauna became extinct. Indeed, Kershaw is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small but <b>growing</b> group of palynologists who suggest that the arrival of Aborigines may have occurred more than 100,000 years ago, fire-stick in hand, eager to burn the virgin landscape. He suggests that their burning caused the sequences of vegetation changes which he detects through the late Pleistocene. The first to propose such an early arrival for Aborigines was Gurdip Singh from the Australian National University, who found evidence in his pollen cores from Lake George indicating that Aborigines began burning in the lake catchment around 120,000 years ago (Singh and Geisler, 1985).|$|R
40|$|Nitrate {{contamination}} is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> {{the most}} ubiquitous water contaminants worldwide. Consuming {{small amounts of}} nitrate {{has been linked to}} Blue Baby Syndrome, various cancers, and other reproductive health effects 1. To combat this problem, the World Health Organization (WHO) has set nitrate limits in drinking water to 50 ppm. Frequent widespread testing of water sources in high-risk regions is critical to protecting public health. However, current nitrate detection methods are inherently inaccurate or too expensive for frequent use where they are needed most. To satisfy this unmet need, we present a novel point-of-use microfluidic sensor for the electrochemical detection of nitrate in drinking water for use in developing countries where this problem is prevalent. Our device is robust, inexpensive, and accurate, rendering it ideal for use in developing countries. Our proposed device utilizes a three-electrode system to detect nitrate electrochemically via inexpensive disposable chips. The working electrode is copper-plated copper ink, the counter electrode silver ink, and the reference electrode silver/silver chloride ink. The electrodes are painted onto a vinyl substrate, providing a cost-effective platform. The electrodes are housed in an acrylic casing. When the sensor is connected to an electrochemical analyzer and <b>a</b> small volume <b>of</b> water sample is deposited onto the sensor. Differential pulse voltammetry is performed with <b>a</b> potential range <b>of</b> 0 to – 0. 8 V at <b>a</b> rate <b>of</b> 0. 1 V/sec, producing a current peak for our analyte. Our electrochemical sensor detects nitrate in water with high sensitivity as low as 14 ppm, well below the maximum limit of the WHO requirement. The microfluidic sensor combined with a hand-held electrochemical analyzer represents <b>one</b> example <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> trend towards point-of-care diagnostics. This proposed platform, combined with a mobile application as demonstrated by us and others 2, is capable of delivering accurate and rapid readings at the water sources will contribute to identify the contaminated sources and to evaluate the efficiency of water treatment, as well as to inform public health regulatory agencies with this pertinent information...|$|R

Our multi-band observations span the range in time over which this so-called Li-Paczynski mini-supernova could be active, beginning within 3 hours of the GRB trigger, and represent some of the deepest and most comprehensive searches for such emission. We find no evidence for such activity and place limits on the abundances and the lifetimes of the possible radioactive nuclides that could form in the rapid decompression of nuclear-density matter. Furthermore, our limits are significantly fainter than the peak magnitude of any previously detected broad-lined Type Ic supernova (SN) associated with other GRBs, effectively ruling out a long GRB-like SN for with this event. Given the unambiguous redshift of the host galaxy (z= 0. 456), GRB 070724 <b>A</b> represents <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small, but <b>growing,</b> number of short-hard GRBs for which firm physical/restframe quantities currently exist.
