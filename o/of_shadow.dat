5|$|Castlevania: Lords <b>of</b> <b>Shadow</b> is an action-adventure {{video game}} {{developed}} by MercurySteam and Kojima Productions, published by Konami and released on October 5, 2010 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The PC version {{was released on}} August 27, 2013. The game is a reboot of the Castlevania series. Set in Southern Europe during the Middle Ages, the story focuses on Gabriel Belmont and his quest to defeat a malevolent order known as the Lords <b>of</b> <b>Shadow</b> and resurrect his wife. The player controls Gabriel in 3D environments as he uses melee skills to defeat enemies and solves puzzles {{to move through the}} game.|$|E
5|$|The {{developers}} {{attempted to}} reach out to new audiences by distancing Lords <b>of</b> <b>Shadow</b> from previous Castlevania games, but kept some elements intact to not alienate franchise fans. For example, vampires and werewolves are recurring enemies in the game, but other existing enemies include trolls, giant spiders and goblin-like creatures. The enemies can be defeated for experience points, which can be used to purchase combos or to augment the player's abilities further. Lords <b>of</b> <b>Shadow</b> has large-scale bosses known as titans. The Combat Cross can be used to grapple onto their bodies and navigate them, and break the runes that animate the titan.|$|E

5|$|Castlevania was rebooted {{due to the}} team's {{concern over}} the poor sales in their latest Castlevania games. The team wished to expand the franchise's fanbase with this game. A number of prototypes in {{parallel}} development competed {{to become the next}} Castlevania title. Konami told MercurySteam the game would be an original intellectual property (IP) when it was first greenlit as a Castlevania title. Konami eventually asked them to cease work on Lords <b>of</b> <b>Shadow</b> while it was still in its early stages, until David Cox showed the Japanese senior management the game and was offered help by video game designer Hideo Kojima. Konami then chose the pitch for it as the next Castlevania entry. The original concept for the game was to remake the first Castlevania starring Simon Belmont, but it was later decided to make a reboot of the franchise. Lords <b>of</b> <b>Shadow</b> still drew inspiration from earlier titles in the series, most notably Castlevania for the Nintendo Entertainment System, and Super Castlevania IV.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{increased}} hardware capabilities, the team were able to increase both the content and graphical quality. With the aim of encouraging new players to buy the game, the overall difficulty was reduced compared to previous entries. After the unconventional gameplay of Gaiden, Mystery of the Emblem returned to the traditional gameplay used for Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light, in addition to continuing the story of Marth after focusing on different characters for Gaiden. Mystery of the Emblem was initially only going to include original story content, but after consideration, {{it was decided to}} include an upgraded version <b>of</b> <b>Shadow</b> Dragon and the Blade of Light for those who had not played the original. Another proposed plan was to split the release into two parts: a remake <b>of</b> <b>Shadow</b> Dragon and the Blade of Light and Mystery of the Emblem. Due to space limitations, some characters featured in the original version <b>of</b> <b>Shadow</b> Dragon and the Blade of Light needed to be cut. The romance between Marth and Caeda was introduced as a refined version of a similar plot featured in Gaiden. As with previous games set in Archanea, the series' titular Fire Emblem took the form of a shield inset with five magical gems. According to Kaga, Mystery of the Emblem was intended as the last major title to be set on the continent of Archanea.|$|E
5|$|Although {{advocates and}} {{practitioners}} of scientific jury selection claim {{the practice is}} overwhelmingly effective at choosing juries that will render the desired verdict, its true effect is often more difficult to discern. Part of this difficulty is in duplicating the conditions of a real trial. In one experiment, two kinds <b>of</b> <b>shadow</b> juries watched a trial and rendered a verdict. The {{results indicated that the}} juries were substantially different, but that this difference was likely due to the two experimental juries’ knowledge that they were not deciding an actual verdict, prompting a lower burden of proof.|$|E

5000|$|Pagan author Raymond Buckland {{said in his}} 2002 book, [...] "The Witch Book", {{that the}} Charmed Book <b>of</b> <b>Shadows</b> gave the show an air of {{authenticity}} and showed that the producers of the show seemed to at least know a little {{of what they were}} talking about when depicting wiccan practices.Judika Illes adds that the Charmed Book <b>of</b> <b>Shadows</b> describes the shows witches much in the same way as the real world Italian Benandanti traditions. She claims the show draws deeply on wiccan terminology and ritual (such as the witches adding information to their Book <b>of</b> <b>Shadows),</b> but asserts that it is still a fantasy show. In The Book of Shadows: The Unofficial Charmed Companion, Ngaire E. Genge talks about the Charmed Book <b>of</b> <b>Shadows</b> in relationship to a modern wiccan Book <b>of</b> <b>Shadows</b> and the ancient grimoires of such notables as Abra-Melen the Mage and King Solomon. The author is more critical of Charmeds use of the book compared to real-world wiccans but adds, as Buckland did, that it is still a fantasy show. While not specifically mentioning the Charmed Book <b>of</b> <b>Shadows</b> by name, The Craft: A Witch’s Book <b>of</b> <b>Shadows,</b> by Dorothy Morrison, appears to have been highly influenced by the series and features the same triquetra symbol on its cover as does the Halliwells Book <b>of</b> <b>Shadows.</b>|$|R
5|$|As {{with its}} predecessor, {{gameplay}} is centred around Nights {{flying through the}} dreams of the two children.

Development of Journey of Dreams began shortly after the release <b>of</b> <b>Shadow</b> the Hedgehog in 2005, and was headed by Sonic Team veteran Takashi Iizuka. The team took steps to ensure that the game stayed faithful to the original, while incorporating a variety of new mechanics and features. The game's setting was designed to resemble England, especially parts of London.|$|E

His first shadow cabinet role came in November 1988, when Neil Kinnock appointed him as Shadow Secretary of State for Energy, and in July 1992, was promoted to the role <b>of</b> <b>Shadow</b> Home Secretary on the election of John Smith as Leader of the Labour Party.|$|E

5|$|Mystery of the Emblem began {{development}} in 1992 during {{the production of}} Fire Emblem Gaiden. The staff from previous entries, including series creator Shouzou Kaga and composer Yuka Tsujiyoko, returned to their respective roles. While originally conceived as two separate projects, the team eventually merged the proposed remake <b>of</b> <b>Shadow</b> Dragon and the Blade of Light with the original story content of Mystery of the Emblem. The gameplay, which had veered away from the first game's tactical RPG routes in Gaiden, returned to its more traditional stance. The difficulty was lowered to encourage new players to try the series.|$|E
5|$|Production of the Rolls-Royce Merlin {{was driven}} by the forethought and {{determination}} of Ernest Hives, who at times was enraged by the apparent complacency and lack of urgency encountered in his frequent correspondence with Air Ministry and local authority officials.

Forming new alliances with neighboring kingdoms, Marth must form a new army to retrieve the mystical Falchion sword and Fire Emblem shield to defeat both Gharnef and Medeus. The gameplay follows the Fire Emblem standards of turn-based battles played out on grid-based maps. Returning features include a character class system which evolves based on character usage, and permanent death for units defeated in battle.|$|E
5|$|Some animals, {{such as the}} horned lizards of North America, {{have evolved}} {{elaborate}} measures to eliminate shadow. Their bodies are flattened, with the sides thinning to an edge; the animals habitually press their bodies to the ground; and their sides are fringed with white scales which effectively hide and disrupt any remaining areas <b>of</b> <b>shadow</b> there may be under {{the edge of the}} body. The theory that the body shape of the horned lizards which live in open desert is adapted to minimise shadow is supported by the one species which lacks fringe scales, the roundtail horned lizard, which lives in rocky areas and resembles a rock. When this species is threatened, it makes itself look as much like a rock as possible by curving its back, emphasizing its three-dimensional shape. Some species of butterflies, such as the speckled wood, Pararge aegeria, minimise their shadows when perched by closing the wings over their backs, aligning their bodies with the sun, and tilting to one side towards the sun, so that the shadow becomes a thin inconspicuous line rather than a broad patch. Similarly, some ground-nesting birds including the European nightjar select a resting position facing the sun. The elimination <b>of</b> <b>shadow</b> was identified as a principle of military camouflage during the Second World War.|$|E

An observer in the antumbra, the area <b>of</b> <b>shadow</b> beyond the umbra, will see an annular eclipse.|$|E
