Although this augmented approach enhanced the overall navigational accuracy to some extent, it still suffers from some drawbacks that diverge the system accuracy during GPS long <b>outage</b> <b>periods.</b> These drawbacks stem from the wide-variational behavior and high nonlinearities of the errors in MEMS gyros which make it difficult to depend on the non-adaptive linear error model provided by KF to model the two types of MEMS azimuth errors.|$|R
40|$|A multi-terminal dc (MTDC) grid has {{a number}} of {{advantages}} over traditional ac transmission. However, dc protection {{is still one of the}} main technical issues holding back the expansion of point-to-point dc links to MTDC networks. Most dc protection strategies are based on dc circuit breakers (DCCBs); however, DCCBs are still under development and their arrival to the market will come at an unclear time and cost. Conversely, ac circuit breakers (ACCBs) are readily available and represent a more economic alternative to protect dc networks. Following this line, a protection strategy for MTDC grids is proposed in this paper. This uses ACCBs for dc fault current clearing and fast dc disconnectors for fault isolation. The faulty link is correctly discriminated and isolated while communication links are not required. This strategy contributes to a reduced network <b>outage</b> <b>period</b> as the non-faulty links are out of operation for a relatively short period of time and are restored in a progressive manner.

When a new control command is not received at the actuator node at an appropriate time instance, the predictive outage compensator suggests a replacement command based on the history of past control commands. It is shown that a simple tuning phase together with the monitoring of the control history can lead to a compensator that can improve the closed-loop control performance under communication outages considerably compared to traditional schemes. Worst case performance bounds are given that relate the quality of the tuning phase and the complexity of the compensator with the length of the communication <b>outage</b> <b>period.</b> Zero-order-hold (holding the past control command if the current is lost) and applying an a priori decided constant signal (using a predefined value on the control command if the current is lost) are special cases of the more general compensation scheme presented.

The SBAS correction is only available within its service area, and the prediction of the SBAS corrections during the <b>outage</b> <b>period</b> can extend the coverage area. Two time series forecasting models, autoregressive moving average (ARMA) and autoregressive (AR), are proposed to predict the corrections outside the service area. A simulated GPS satellite visibility condition is applied to the WAAS correction data, and the prediction accuracy degradation, along with the time, is investigated. Prediction results using the SBAS rate of change information are compared, and the ARMA method yields a better accuracy than the rate method. The error reductions of the ephemeris and clock by the ARMA method over the rate method are 37. 8 % and 38. 5 %, respectively. The AR method shows a slightly better orbit accuracy than the rate method, but its clock accuracy is even worse than the rate method. If the SBAS correction is sufficiently accurate comparing with the required ephemeris accuracy of a real-time navigation filter, then the predicted SBAS correction may improve orbit determination accuracy...|$|E

Purposively selected participants were invited to contribute to initial data collection using an online survey, followed by interviews with selected participants. Thematic {{analysis of the data}} was performed by both research team members. SETTING: South-western Victoria, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals from organisations involved in Telstra recovery efforts, disaster management, health care and general practice staff. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The survey collected freeform responses from participants. Semi-structured interviews further explored a variety of experiences from purposively selected participants. RESULTS: Organisations and practices in the region were prepared for major disasters, but not for the unusual and 2 ̆ 7 limited 2 ̆ 7 disaster of losing telecommunications, including lack of Internet access and loss of telephone services. Although alternative measures were found for telecommunications, there was still a significant impact on many health-care-related activities and general practice functionality during the <b>outage</b> <b>period.</b> In particular, there was an increase in duties for administrative staff to compensate for loss of telecommunications.

40|$|Along {{with the}} {{ever-increasing}} volume of Internet and other communication traffic intoday’s networks, {{the advancement of}} key technologies such as Wavelength Division Multiplexing(WDM) or Dense WDM (DWDM) could enable a tremendous improvement inutilisation of the enourmous bandwidth that optical fibres are capable of providing. Forlarge-scale transmission deployment, optical networking offers excellent solutions due toits transmission reliability; with low-bit error rate, massive capacity and high scalability. Being {{the backbone of the}} network and responsible for the distribution of huge amountof traffic, optical mesh networks are consequently faced with great expectations for thereliability of the services delivered. The failure of an optical component, such as a fibre cutor a link-down at a node, often has catastrophic consequences leading to communicationdisruption, loss of data, services and profits. For instance, according to Gartner Group,up to $ 500 million in US business losses would have been inflicted by network failures experiencedthrough 2004. A direct voice-call revenue loss from the failure of a major trunkgroup is frequently quoted at amounting to more than $ 100, 000 per minute. In anothercase reported by the International Cable Protection Committee, a powerful earthquakein Taiwan in December 2006 caused damage to four major fiber optics lines as well asnine cables laid undersea. It took 49 days to repair all 21 damaged points. These casessignify that protection design against network failures has a crucial and imperative role intelecommunications networks today - being of even more significance in the case of opticalmesh networks. The central theme of this dissertation revolves around this vital researcharea. Protection design, however, can not cover for all scenarios of network failures. Indeed,the protection expectation of traffic demands is varied. Majority of these, defined as goldservice class, require an average <b>outage</b> <b>period</b> of around 5 minutes per year with fullrestorability against single span failures. Others, such as the platinum service class, mayrequire higher protection against dual span failures; or average <b>outage</b> <b>period</b> of 30 secondsper year. This thesis first studies the minimum requirements regarding the connectivity of a physical network topology to ensure the success of restoration algorithms to achieveMultiple Quality of Protection (MQoP). Furthermore, we propose the mathematical formulationfor determining the relationship between any two paths connecting each node-pair. This principle plays an important role as the core of modeling potential and eligible sets ofdisjoint and distinct path candidates for designing backup routes against network failures. On the other hand, protection design in optical transport networks can be applied ateither Optical Channel sublayer (OCh) known as span-based, or, Optical Multiplex Sectionsublayer (OMS), known as path-based. A variety of restoration techniques have beendesigned and implemented for mesh networks including span restoration, path restoration,p-cycles, etc. This thesis studies the design of these protection schemes for supportingMQoP service classes. We propose a new optimisation model for Shared Backup PathProtection (SBPP) with the objective of minimising the number of constraints and reducingthe model complexity. This model is much more tractable with large size networks. For pcycledesign, we propose a new mathematical model to construct sufficient a set of p-cyclesto protect failed working channels or flows. Unlike a conventional model which selects theoptimal set of p-cycles from all pre-determined cycles in the network, this approach usesspan-based variables to indicate whether or not a cycle crosses a span. Therefore, thecomplexity of the model is significantly reduced in large scale networks where the numberof all cycles exponentially increases with network size. Finally, it is noted that each of these protection schemes has its own advantages anddisadvantages in terms of complexity, capacity efficiency and restoration time. In addition,the use of an individual technique for MQoPs may be neither possible or efficient. Anew mathematical model is proposed based on a mixed-protection formulation to supportMQoPs. Despite of the complexity of modeling, this optimisation formulation efficientlyutilises the advantages of each protection scheme with respect to different service classesand, hence, maximise the efficiency. Consequently, the interaction between service classesis formulated and investigated to provide the minimum amount of capacity utilisation for agiven network topology. The best mixture of service classes would determine whether or notthe existing physical topology is suitable to support the known or predicted requirementsof traffic demands...|$|E

40|$|Mobile laser {{scanning}} systems are becoming an increasingly popular means to obtain 3 D coverage {{on a large}} scale. To perform the mapping, the exact position of the vehicle must be known throughout the trajectory. Exact position is achieved via integration of Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and Inertial Navigation Systems (INS). Yet, in urban environments, cases of complete or even partial GPS outages may occur leaving the navigation solution to rely only on the INS. The INS navigation solution degrades with time as the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) measurements contains noise, which permeates into the navigation equations. Degradation of the position determination leads to loss of data in such segments. To circumvent such drift and its effects, we propose fusing INS with lidar data by using building edges.

To maintain the normal operation of the ATM system during the <b>period</b> of GPS <b>outage,</b> the use of the current radar system is proposed in this paper.

These methods are, therefore, not well suited for rapid updating. Fortunately, however, the development of land-based mobile mapping systems (MMS) has opened a new avenue to meet these challenges. Land-based MMS are capable of providing fast, efficient, cost-effective and complete data acquisition. As such, they are an innovative technology for creating and updating 3 -D GIS databases both quickly and inexpensively. Basically, MMS are based on integrated navigation systems, mainly the integration of GPS and inertial sensors. The integration of these two technologies results in navigation systems with extremely accurate velocity, position, and attitude with almost no noise or time lags. Under ideal conditions, the GPS measurements are consistent in accuracy and availability throughout the survey mission. However, for land-based MMS, such conditions do not often exist. This is especially prevalent in urban centres and when encountering highway overpasses or tunnels. The overall objective {{of this paper is}} investigating a purely photogrammetric strategy for georeferencing of short image sequences as backup system when the navigation solution is not available or not sufficiently accurate, a typical case during GPS signal <b>outage</b> <b>periods.</b> A photogrammetric strategy for the georeferencing of image sequences acquired by MMS is presented. These objectives are accomplished through the simulation of the University of Calgary VISA...|$|R
40|$|In {{small cell}} networks, high {{mobility}} of users results in frequent handoff and thus severely restricts the data rate for mobile users. To alleviate this problem, we propose to use heterogeneous, two-tier network structure where static users {{are served by}} both macro and micro base stations, whereas the mobile (i. e., moving) users are served only by macro base stations having larger cells; {{the idea is to}} prevent frequent data outage for mobile users due to handoff. We use the classical two-tier Poisson network model with different transmit powers (cf [1]), assume independent Poisson process of static users and doubly stochastic Poisson process of mobile users moving at a constant speed along infinite straight lines generated by a Poisson line process. Using stochastic geometry, we calculate the average downlink data rate of the typical static and mobile (i. e., moving) users, the latter accounted for handoff <b>outage</b> <b>periods.</b> We consider also the average throughput of these two types of users defined as their average data rates divided by the mean total number of users co-served by the same base station. We find that if the density of a homogeneous network and/or the speed of mobile users is high, it is advantageous to let the mobile users connect only to some optimal fraction of BSs to reduce the frequency of handoffs during which the connection is not assured. If a heterogeneous structure of the network is allowed, one can further jointly optimize the mean throughput of mobile and static users by appropriately tuning the powers of micro and macro base stations subject to some aggregate power constraint ensuring unchanged mean data rates of static users via the network equivalence property (see [2]).

50|$|Xenon-135 in {{particular}} tremendously affects {{the operation of}} a nuclear reactor because it's the most powerful known neutron poison. The inability of a reactor to be restarted due to the buildup of xenon-135 (reaches a maximum after about 10 hours) is {{sometimes referred to as}} xenon precluded start-up. The period of time in which the reactor is unable to override the effects of xenon-135 is called the xenon dead time or poison <b>outage.</b> During <b>periods</b> of steady state operation, at a constant neutron flux level, the xenon-135 concentration builds up to its equilibrium value for that reactor power in about 40 to 50 hours. When the reactor power is increased, xenon-135 concentration initially decreases because the burn up is increased at the new, higher power level. Thus, the dynamics of xenon poisoning are important for the stability of the flux pattern and geometrical power distribution, especially in physically large reactors.|$|R
40|$|Power {{shortages}} {{result in}} power <b>outages</b> for <b>period</b> of 8 to 10 Hrs aday {{in rural areas}} due to significant gap between electricity demandand supply. Rural banking {{is one of the}} sectors severely affected by power. Majority of population in emerging markets like India livein rural areas. Therefore, reliability and operational efficiency ofrural banking is of utmost importance to include rural population into national main stream. To overcome the problem, solar hybrid power system with battery backup is gaining popularity. However, expensive components like solar array, battery in the system hindering itswide adaptation. In this paper, efficient DC electrical distribution is proposed to reduce the sizes of expensive solar and battery components. Economic analysis is performed for a typical core banking rural bank. It is shown that by adopting DC grid, Rs. 1. 22 lakhcan be saved per rural bank. The saving will be Rs. 1. 83 billion, if DC grid is implemented across all the 15, 000 branches of rural banks...|$|R
40|$|Overlay network {{monitoring}} enables distributed Internet {{applications to}} detect and recover from path <b>outages</b> and <b>periods</b> of degraded performance within seconds. For an overlay network with n end hosts, existing systems either require O(n 2) measurements, and thus lack scalability, or can only estimate the latency but not congestion or failures. Unlike other network tomography systems, we characterize end-toend losses (this extends to any additive metrics, including latency) rather than individual link losses. We find a minimal basis set of k linearly independent paths that can fully describe all the O(n 2) paths. We selectively monitor and measure the loss rates of these paths, then apply them to estimate the loss rates of all other paths. By extensively studying synthetic and real topologies, we find that for reasonably large n (e. g., 100), k {{is only in the}} range of O(n log n). This is explained by the moderately hierarchical nature of Internet routing. Our scheme only assumes the knowledge of underlying IP topology, and any link can become lossy or return to normal. In addition, our technique is tolerant to topology measurement inaccuracies, and is adaptive to topology changes...|$|R
