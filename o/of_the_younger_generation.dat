5|$|As Leader of the Opposition, Douglas-Home persuaded Macleod and Powell {{to rejoin}} the Conservative front bench. Within weeks of the general {{election}} Butler retired from politics, accepting the post of Master of Trinity College, Cambridge together with a life peerage. Douglas-Home did not immediately allocate shadow portfolios to his colleagues, but in January 1965 he gave Maudling the foreign affairs brief and Heath became spokesman on Treasury and economic affairs. There was no immediate pressure for Douglas-Home {{to hand over the}} leadership to a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>generation,</b> but by early 1965 a new Conservative group called PEST (Pressure for Economic and Social Toryism) had discreetly begun to call for a change. Douglas-Home either did not know, or chose to ignore, the fact that Heath had made a donation to PEST. He decided that the time was coming for him to retire as leader, with Heath as his preferred successor.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, {{frustrated}} with the perceived lack of success against RAF Fighter Command, Göring was keen on infusing the fighter force leadership with younger blood. He perceived a lack of aggressiveness in the Jagdgeschwader leadership. The likes of Theo Osterkamp were the first victim of this policy, handing over JG 51 to Werner Mölders. Oesau {{was considered to be}} one such rising star. However, being a star and staying in Göring's favor required keeping up the kill rate and promotions were invariably linked to scores. According to Dr. Kurt Tank, the Focke–Wulf designer, although many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>generation</b> were good flyers, they were unable to cope with problems of overall planning and broader strategic aspects. However, Oesau was one of the outstanding leaders ever produced by Luftwaffe fighter wings with the likes of Werner Mölders and Adolf Galland.|$|E
25|$|Among many {{immigrant}} families, members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>generation</b> tend {{to assimilate}} to American culture {{at a faster}} rate than members of older generations. This can create divides along generational lines. Members of the older generation may dislike the influence that American culture has on the younger generation, particularly shifts from communal values to a more individualistic mindset. On the other hand, members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>generation</b> may view their elders as too set in their ways and out of touch with American society. Such sentiments can lead to conflict between family members. Points of contention include clothing, speech, displaying respect for elders, and dating practices.|$|E

25|$|The art {{of playing}} the dhak is now being {{referred}} to as a dying profession,this is sad but true. While some of the dhakis may be lucky to retain old contacts, many are facing a decline and some are moving away from the traditional profession. Take the example of the seventy dhaki families in Amrul, a village in Bankura district. Ancestors of the dhakis were on the rolls of Malla kings of Bishnupur. Daily pujas were organised for the deities in the palace and the dhakis played a significant role. Times have changed. One of them was offered Rs. 800 for playing the dhak for five days. It is a pittance. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>generation</b> even took to work as shoe shine boys, but the older generation still has pride in being artists. They look down upon such misadventures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>generation,</b> but do not have an alternative before themselves.|$|E
25|$|Around this time, younger writers emerged. Claire Tham and Ovidia Yu wrote short stories, while playwright Stella Kon {{put forth}} her lesser-known science-fiction novel, Eston (1995). <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>generation,</b> Philip Jeyaretnam has shown promise {{but has not}} {{published}} a new novel since Abraham's Promise (1995).

25|$|In {{recent years}} many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>generation</b> of secular Jews have {{moved away from}} the crowded city center. There has also been small but steady growth of Orthodox {{satellite}} communities in suburbs such as Edegem, Wilrijk and Brasschaat. This may cause the Antwerp community to seem overwhelmingly Haredi to the casual observer. After New York City, London and Paris, Antwerp {{is one of the largest}} communities of Haredi Jews outside Israel.|$|E
25|$|They are a {{community}} in transition. Some of the kessim accept the rabbinic/Talmudic tradition that is practiced by non-Ethiopian Orthodox Jews. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>generation</b> of Ethiopian-Israelis have been educated in yeshivas and received rabbinical ordination (semikha). A certain segment of traditionalist kessim insist on maintaining their separate and distinct form of Judaism, {{as it had been}} practiced in Ethiopia and Eritrea. Many of the Ethiopian Jewish youth who have immigrated to Israel or been born there have assimilated either to the dominant form of Orthodox Judaism, or to a secular lifestyle.|$|E

However, the Original Ifuntok Language is fast dying out, as more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>generations</b> speak {{a mixture of}} Ilocano, Tagalog, and Kankanaey Dialects. This {{is partly due to}} <b>the</b> frequent contact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>generations</b> with other regions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Philippine nation.

25|$|Most Chinese villagers {{bury their}} {{deceased}} ones {{at the local}} town cemetery. Others cremate the dead at the nearest Wat. If the deceased is old, a three-day funeral ceremony and memorial is conducted, complete with chanting from the monks. But if the deceased is <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>generation,</b> they are either buried or cremated as soon as possible.

25|$|The islanders {{want the}} top soil removed, {{but the money}} is not there for the cleanup. The {{opportunity}} for some Bikini islanders to potentially relocate back to their home island creates a dilemma. While the island may be habitable in the near term, {{virtually all of the}} islanders alive today have never lived there. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>generation</b> have never visited. , unemployment in the Marshall Islands was at about 40 percent. The population is growing at a four-percent growth rate, so increasing numbers are taking advantage of terms in the Marshall Islands’ Compact of Free Association that allow them to obtain jobs in the United States.|$|E
25|$|In many {{immigrant}} families, members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>generation</b> {{have greater}} English language proficiency than their elders. In families where parents may know {{little to no}} English, children may act as interpreters. Young children may therefore be involved in important family matters, including finances. In cases where children {{are in charge of}} paying bills, they may {{be in a position to}} take a portion of their parents' money for their own use. Even when this is not the case, the role of interpreter gives a particular family member a certain measure of control over other family members who are unable to communicate as well in English.|$|E

25|$|As of {{the early}} 21st century, more and more waishengren see {{themselves}} as Taiwanese and as socially distinct from current residents of Mainland China. Unlike those belonging to {{groups such as the}} Hakka or Taiwanese aboriginals, waishengren are not encouraged to find their root, and their relationship with anti-China organizations suffers further as a result. Most of them, especially those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>generation,</b> make extensive efforts to establish themselves as Taiwanese, sometimes by manifesting good interest in Hoklo Taiwanese culture. At the same time, right-wing discourse alleging that pro-unification waishengren are a fifth column for the PRC agonizes those mainlanders who regard Taiwan as their new homeland.|$|E
25|$|UNESCO {{estimates}} that an estimated $11 {{billion per year}} is necessary to reach the 2015 EFA goals. The disparity between need and aid is apparent: aid sent to low-income countries to provide basic education in 2004 and 2005 was {{at an average of}} $3.1 billion per year. The Fast Track Initiative (FTI) provides {{one of the most promising}} paths to universal primary education by 2015. Set up as a partnership between donors and developing countries and non-governmental organizations, the FTI endorses developing countries that put primary education at the forefront of their domestic efforts and develop sound national education plans.

25|$|The {{decision}} to allow this type of performance was a very unusual one for the city's government to make, as all other regions had instituted very restrictive laws regarding the musical performance of slaves, and even New Orleans had legislation that eliminated essentially every other aspect of the African culture. Nevertheless, the former Africans were able to play their traditional music, which started to intermingle {{with the sounds of}} the many other cultures in New Orleans at the time: Haitian, European, Cuban, and American, as well as many other smaller denominations. However, the people playing in Congo Square were not <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>generation,</b> the one traditionally associated with innovation and new attitudes toward mixing culture, but older musicians.|$|E

25|$|While {{academic}} {{attention has}} remained, perhaps disproportionately, focused on poetry from Northern Ireland, several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>generation</b> of Irish poets (Justin Quinn, Caitriona O'Reilly) have proved perceptive and independent {{critics of the}} contemporary scene, as have several older poets who are also literary critics, such as Hugh McFadden, Dennis O'Driscoll and Michael Smith. One of the major movements in Irish poetry {{in the last ten}} years is in performance poetry, led by young poets who not only publish books of poetry but are known for their live poetry, and work in other mediums such as video. Some of the poets in this generation are Máighréad Medbh, Dave Lordan, Colm Keegan, Sarah Clancy, Elaine Feeney, Alvy Carragher, and Billy Ramsell.|$|E
25|$|The Isleños in Louisiana make up four {{communities}} that speak dialects of Spanish, {{these include the}} Isleños of Saint Bernard Parish who have managed to preserve their culture {{as well as their}} dialect of Canarian Spanish, although none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>generation</b> speak more than a few words; the Brulis, who live in scattered households in southern Louisiana and speak a dialect with French loan words; and the Adaeseños in the Natchitoches and Sabine parishes who speak a very similar dialect with loan words from the Nahuatl language of Mexico. The Isleño communities of Saint Bernard parish have also preserved the Spanish Canarian dialect spoken from the 18th century to present times, although it is in danger of dying out with the last speakers among the elderly segment of the population.|$|E
25|$|To the Lakota Native Americans, Tayamnicankhu (Orion’s Belt) is {{the spine}} of a bison. The great {{rectangle}} of Orion are the bison's ribs; the Pleiades star cluster in nearby Taurus is the bison’s head; and Sirius in Canis Major, known as Tayamnisinte, is its tail. Another Lakota myth mentions that {{the bottom half of}} Orion, the Constellation of the Hand, represented the arm of a chief that was ripped off by the Thunder People as a punishment from the gods for his selfishness. His daughter offered to marry the person who can retrieve his arm from the sky, so the young warrior Fallen Star (whose father was a star and whose mother was human) returned his arm and married his daughter, symbolizing harmony between the gods and humanity with the help <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>generation.</b> The index finger is represented by Rigel; the Orion Nebula is the thumb; the Belt of Orion is the wrist; and the star Beta Eridani is the pinky finger.|$|E
