500|$|Although it {{had been}} known how to prepare carbon {{monoxide}} since 1776, it was not at first recognised that carbon monoxide poisoning was the mechanism of death and injury from stoves burning carbonaceous fuels. [...] A coroner's inquest into the death in 1838 of James Trickey, a nightwatchman who had spent all night by {{a new type of}} charcoal burning stove in St Michael, Cornhill, concluded that the poison involved was carbonic acid (that is, carbon dioxide) rather than carbon monoxide. [...] Both Bird and Snow gave evidence to the inquest supporting poisoning by carbonic acid. [...] Bird himself started to suffer ill effects while collecting air samples from the floor near the stove. [...] However, the makers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stove,</b> Harper and Joyce, produced a string of their own expert witnesses, who convinced the jury to decide that death was caused by apoplexy, and that [...] "impure air" [...] was only a contributing factor. [...] Among the unscientific claims made at the inquest by Harper and Joyce were that carbonic gas would rise to the ceiling (in fact it is heavier than air and, according to Bird, would lie in a layer close to the floor, just where the sleeping Trickey's head would rest) and that [...] "deleterious vapour" [...] from the coffins in the vaults had risen into the church. [...] After the inquest Joyce threatened to sue a journal which continued to criticise the stove for its lack of ventilation. [...] In a subsequent clarification, Bird made it clear that any stove burning carbonaceous fuel was dangerous if it did not have a chimney or other means of ventilation. [...] In fact, Trickey had only been placed in the church in the first place at the suggestion of Harper, who was expecting him to give favourable reports of the new stove's performance.Steventon and Mitchell, p. 38 ...|$|E

[...] The text goes on to recount his mother's superstitious beliefs, which he himself had come to share. Following Smaranda's indication, Nică believed that blond-haired boys such as himself could invoke sunny weather by playing outside on a rainy day, that various dangers could be cursed away, and that marking the human body with soot or mud meant protection against the evil eye.

2500|$|Technological {{advances}} during industrialization brought {{major changes}} to the kitchen. Iron stoves, which enclosed the fire completely and were more efficient, appeared. Early models included the Franklin stove around 1740, which was a furnace stove intended for heating, not for cooking. Benjamin Thompson in England designed his [...] "Rumford stove" [...] around 1800. This stove was much more energy efficient than earlier stoves; it used one fire to heat several pots, which were hung into holes on top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stove</b> and were thus heated from all sides instead of just from the bottom. However, his stove was designed for large kitchens; it was too big for domestic use. The [...] "Oberlin stove" [...] was a refinement of the technique {{that resulted in a}} size reduction; it was patented in the U.S. in 1834 and became a commercial success with some 90,000 units sold over the next 30 years. These stoves were still fired with wood or coal.

Outcomes were assessed after approximately 18 months use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new <b>stove.</b> Our objectives were to compare self-rated health and change in health among women participating in a randomised control trial comparing a chimney stove with an open fire, to describe impacts on women's daily lives and their perceptions of how reduced kitchen smoke affects their own and their children's health. Results On intention-to-treat analysis, 52. 8 % of intervention women reported improvement in health, compared to 23. 8 % of control women (p Conclusion Women's perception of their health was improved, but although smoke reduction was valued, this was linked mainly with alleviation of non-respiratory symptoms like eye discomfort and headache. More focus on such symptoms may help in promoting demand for improved stoves and cleaner fuels, but education about more severe consequences of IAP exposure is also required. </p...|$|R
