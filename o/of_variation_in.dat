40|$|We {{investigate}} the respective role <b>of</b> <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> subpolar deep water formation and Nordic Seas overflows for the decadal to multidecadal variability of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). This {{is done by}} analysing long (order of 1000 yr) control simulations with five coupled climate models as well as sensitivity experiments performed {{with one of the}} models, in which we suppress the variability of either subpolar deep water formation or Nordic Seas overflows. For all models, the maximum influence <b>of</b> <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> subpolar deep water formation is found at about 45 ° N, while the maximum influence <b>of</b> <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> Nordic Seas overflows is rather found at 55 ° N to 60 ° N. Regarding the two overflow branches, the influence <b>of</b> <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> the Denmark Strait overflow is, for all models, substantially larger than that <b>of</b> <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> the overflow across the Iceland–Scotland–Ridge. The influence <b>of</b> <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> subpolar deep water formation is, on multi-model average, larger than that <b>of</b> <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> the Denmark Strait overflow. This is true both at 45 ° N, where the maximum standard deviation of decadal to multidecadal AMOC variability is located for all but one model, and at the more classical latitude of 30 ° N. At 30 ° N, <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> subpolar deep water formation and Denmark Strait overflow explain, on multi-model average, about half and one third respectively of the decadal to multidecadal AMOC variance...|$|R

This research is descriptive qualitative research. The object of the research is procedure texts analysis made by the first semester students of English Department of Muhammadiyah University of Surakarta in 2009 / 2010 academic year. The data is the elements of procedure texts. The method of collecting data is documentation. The technique of data analysis is describing and identifying {{the percentage of the}} elements used in procedure text.

5|$|Lactarius vinosus, {{formerly}} {{considered a}} variety of L.sanguifluus, is quite similar in appearance. In general, L.vinosus can be distinguished by the more vinaceous-red color (lacking orange tones) of its cap, stipe, and gills, the more distinctly downwards-tapered stipe, and the more intense staining of the latex on the cap tissue. The two species can also be distinguished microscopically by differences in the ornamentation of their spore surfaces. L.vinosus has an incomplete reticulum on the spore surface, with ridges that have a wider degree <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> thickness. Another potential lookalike, L.semisanguifluus, has a characteristic orange latex that turns wine-red in 5–10 minutes after exposure to air. Compared to L.sanguifluus, the fruit bodies of L.semisanguifluus are smaller, have tinges of violet in the cap, and develop a greenish discolouration with age.|$|E
5|$|Petter's big-footed mouse is a {{terrestrial}} rodent {{with short}} forelimbs and long hindfeet. With a head and body length of 150mm (5.9in) and body mass of 105g (3.7oz) {{in the only}} known complete specimen, it is much larger than M.bastardi, and its measurements fall {{at or above the}} upper end of the known range <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> M.ingens. The upperparts are covered with soft and short, brown fur. Most cover hairs (the main part of the fur) are dark brown for the two-thirds closest to the base, then light brown, with a short dark brown tip. The middle of the back appears darker, because the cover hairs there are entirely dark brown. The hairs are 6 to 8mm (0.2 to 0.3in) long on the shoulders and 7 to 9mm (0.3 to 0.4in) on the back. The guard hairs are gray. Because the flanks lack entirely dark cover hairs, they are slightly lighter than the rest of the upperparts. They are sharply separated in color from the underparts, which are entirely white to buffish. The mystacial vibrissae (whiskers above the mouth) are long, up to 60mm (2.4in), and white or black in color. The pinnae (external ears) are dark brown and covered with fine gray hairs, and ear length is 32mm (1.3in).|$|E
5|$|Silver also forms alloys {{with most}} other {{elements}} on the periodic table. The elements from groups 1–3, except for hydrogen, lithium, and beryllium, are very miscible with {{silver in the}} condensed phase and form intermetallic compounds; those from groups 4–9 are only poorly miscible; the elements in groups 10–14 (except boron and carbon) have very complex Ag–M phase diagrams and form the most commercially important alloys; and the remaining elements on the periodic table have no consistency in their Ag–M phase diagrams. By far the most important such alloys are those with copper: most silver used for coinage and jewellery is in reality a silver–copper alloy, and the eutectic mixture is used in vacuum brazing. The two metals are completely miscible as liquids but not as solids; their importance in industry {{comes from the fact}} that their properties tend to be suitable over a wide range <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> silver and copper concentration, although most useful alloys tend to be richer in silver than the eutectic mixture (71.9% silver and 28.1% copper by weight, and 60.1% silver and 28.1% copper by atom).|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{archaeological evidence}} for the domestication of the horse comes from sites in Ukraine and Kazakhstan, dating to approximately 4000-3500 BC. By 3000 BC, the horse was completely domesticated and by 2000 BC there was {{a sharp increase in}} the number of horse bones found in human settlements in northwestern Europe, indicating the spread of domesticated horses throughout the continent. The most recent, but most irrefutable, evidence of domestication comes from sites where horse remains were interred with chariots in graves of the Sintashta and Petrovka cultures c. 2100 BC. Studies <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> genetic material shows that very few wild stallions, possibly all from a single haplotype, contributed to the domestic horse, while many mares were part of early domesticated herds.|$|E
5|$|The {{rediscovery of}} Gregor Mendel's laws of {{inheritance}} in 1900 ignited a fierce debate between two camps of biologists. In one camp were the Mendelians, who {{were focused on}} discrete variations {{and the laws of}} inheritance. They were led by William Bateson (who coined the word genetics) and Hugo de Vries (who coined the word mutation). Their opponents were the biometricians, who were interested in the continuous variation of characteristics within populations. Their leaders, Karl Pearson and Walter Frank Raphael Weldon, followed in the tradition of Francis Galton, who had focused on measurement and statistical analysis of variation within a population. The biometricians rejected Mendelian genetics on the basis that discrete units of heredity, such as genes, could not explain the continuous range of variation seen in real populations. Weldon's work with crabs and snails provided evidence that selection pressure from the environment could shift the range <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> wild populations, but the Mendelians maintained that the variations measured by biometricians were too insignificant to account for the evolution of new species.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{large degree}} <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> the size and exact shape of the castles built in England and Wales after the invasion. One popular form of castle was the motte and bailey, in which earth would be piled up into a mound (called a motte) to support a wooden tower, and a wider {{enclosed}} area built alongside it (called a bailey); Stafford Castle is a typical example of a post-invasion motte castle. Another widespread design was the ringwork in which earth would be built up in a circular or oval shape and topped with a wooden rampart; Folkestone Castle {{is a good example}} of a Norman ringwork, in this case built on top of a hill although most post-invasion castles were usually sited on lower ground. Around 80% of Norman castles in this period followed the motte-and-bailey pattern, but ringworks were particularly popular in certain areas, such as south-west England and south Wales. One theory put forward to explain this variation is that ringworks were easier to build in these shallow-soil areas than the larger mottes.|$|E
