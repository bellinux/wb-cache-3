5|$|The new {{voting system}} {{increased}} the socialists' influence in parliament significantly, but its major beneficiaries were the Catholic Party. Partly {{as a result}} of the creation of a Catholic populist challenger, the Christian People's Party, the Catholic Party embraced the new ideology of Social Catholicism introduced following the papal Rerum novarum encyclical of 1891. This gained it considerable popular support, especially in Flanders. In 1894, the Belgian Workers' Party adopted the Charter of Quaregnon, which would form the basis of its ideology until 1979. By 1911, the party had 276,000 members, making it one of the most successful Socialist parties in Europe. As a result of lobbying by the Belgian Workers' Party, Belgium was one of the first countries in Europe to launch a comprehensive social insurance scheme, including sickness compensation (from 1894), voluntary <b>old-age</b> <b>insurance</b> (1900) and unemployment insurance (1907). The big losers from voting reform were the Liberals who lost almost all their parliamentary representation in the years between 1894 and 1900.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, Belgium {{created a}} welfare net {{particularly}} early, {{thanks in part}} to the trade unions.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss the work of Bismarck in {{relation}} to social legislation. Design/methodology/approach – Bismarck's points of views are sketched mainly through quotations from his speeches in Parliament. His position regarding social protection is discussed and a brief evaluation of his policy is presented. Findings – Germany, through the work of Bismarck, was the first country where the state organised a modern social-security system. Compulsory sickness, accident and <b>old-age</b> <b>insurances</b> were passed in 1883, 1884 and 1889, respectively. However, the Chancellor's social policy was not the result of a comprehensive, global, “definitive” programme. It was an opportunist policy influenced more by political than by social motives. Originality/value – The paper offers insights into Bismarck's social policy in the context of the social question. Germany, History, Social policy, Socialism...|$|R
