5|$|Rajab {{was one of}} {{the founders}} of the first migrant workers {{protection}} committee in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, the Migrant Workers Protection Group (in 2003). On 28 April 2007, the Bahraini Parliament passed a law banning unmarried migrant workers from living in residential areas. BCHR issued a press release condemning this decision as discriminatory and promoting negative racist attitudes towards migrant workers. Rajab, then BCHR vice president, said: It is appalling that Bahrain is willing to rest <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> of these people’s hard work, and often their suffering, but that they refuse to live with them in equality and dignity. The solution is not to force migrant workers into ghettos, but to urge companies to improve living conditions for workers – and not to accommodate large numbers of workers in inadequate space, and to improve the standard of living for them.|$|E

25|$|Prior to April 2006 schemes were 'approved' by HMRC {{rather than}} registered.

25|$|East Germany was an Eastern bloc state under {{political}} and military control of the Soviet Union through her occupation forces and the Warsaw Treaty. Political power was solely executed by leading members (Politburo) of the communist-controlled Socialist Unity Party (SED).

While East German propaganda was based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> of the GDR's social programs and the alleged constant threat of a West German invasion, many of her citizens looked to the West for political freedoms and economic prosperity.|$|E

There are restrictions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> that members of eight of these accession countries ('A8' nationals) can claim, which are covered by the Worker Registration Scheme. Many other European Union member states exercised their right to temporary immigration control (which ended in 2011) over entrants from these accession states, but some subsequently removed these restrictions ahead of the 2011 deadline.|$|E
25|$|The role of {{some species}} of birds as pests has been well known, {{particularly}} in agriculture. Granivorous birds such as the queleas in Africa {{are among the most}} numerous birds in the world and foraging flocks can cause devastation. Many insectivorous birds are also noted as beneficial in agriculture. Many early studies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> or damages caused by birds in fields were made by analysis of stomach contents and observation of feeding behaviour. Modern studies aimed to manage birds in agriculture make use {{of a wide range of}} principles from ecology. Intensive aquaculture has brought humans in conflict with fish-eating birds such as cormorants.|$|E

25|$|Between 1989 and 2006, {{there were}} two {{separate}} FDIC funds– the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF), and the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF). The latter was established after the savings and loans crisis of the 1980s. The existence of two separate funds for the same purpose led to banks' attempting to shift from one fund to another, depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> each could provide. In the 1990s, SAIF premiums were, at one point, five times higher than BIF premiums; several banks attempted {{to qualify for the}} BIF, with some merging with institutions qualified for the BIF to avoid the higher premiums of the SAIF. This drove up the BIF premiums as well, resulting in a situation where both funds were charging higher premiums than necessary.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1900s, some early {{research}} in animal cooperation focused <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> of group-living. While {{living in a}} group produces costs {{in the form of}} increased frequency of predator attacks and greater mating competition, some animals find that the benefits outweigh the costs. Animals that practice group-living often benefit from assistance in parasite removal, access to more mates, and conservation of energy in foraging. Initially, the most obvious form of animal cooperation was kin selection, but more recent studies focus on non-kin cooperation, where benefits may seem less obvious. Non-kin cooperation often involves many strategies that include manipulation and coercion, making these interactions more complicated to study. An example of manipulation is presented by the cuckoo, a brood parasite, which lays its eggs in the nest of a bird of another species. That bird then is tricked into feeding and caring for the cuckoo offspring. Although this phenomenon may look like cooperation at first glance, it only presents benefits to one recipient.|$|E
25|$|James Anthony Froude, a {{well-known}} English intellectual, was an apologist for imperial rule. In 1886, he published Oceana, {{another one of}} Froude's works attacking the desire for self-rule in Australia. Like English in the West Indies, it was criticized for its superficial coverage of colonial affairs and Froude's lack {{of exposure to the}} native countries which he discussed. His next travelogue, The English in the West Indies, detailed his travels in the West Indies and his political opinions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> of the Crown Colony form of government. Froude argued that if the West Indian colonies were allowed home rule, the large black population in those colonies would vote for black leaders who would strip away whites' rights. Froude attacked blacks as being racially inferior, and argued that slavery was not as bad as it was commonly believed to be. Froude's work initially received good reviews in English newspapers and journals; however, it caused an outrage in the West Indian colonies.|$|E
40|$|Washington {{courts are}} free to enforce publicland use servitudes. Of the {{elements}} required for a servitude to run with the land, form, notice, and touch and concern <b>on</b> <b>the</b> burden side do not bar running. Only the touch and concern element applied <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> side is a potential bar. Washington conceivably could allow public land use servitudes to run with the land by following the minority position of not requiring touch and concern <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> side. A less stringent theory, however, is available to enforce public land use servitudes. Washington has not adopted a rule that public servitudes are always in gross when government does not directly own <b>benefited</b> land. Therefore, <b>the</b> courts {{are free to}} require touch and concern <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> side while recognizing that the requirement is met when <b>the</b> promise <b>benefits</b> land, regardless of ownership. Based on their past record, Washington courts probably will enforce public land use servitudes. The courts have recognized and responded {{to the need for}} land use control to manage growth and development in the state, thereby furthering both public zoning and private subdivision regulation. Accordingly, to be consistent, the courts must enforce public land use servitudes...|$|R
