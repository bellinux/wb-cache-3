5|$|Another {{earthquake}} hit Sidon around 570 AD; Antoninus of Piacenza, an Italian Christian pilgrim, {{described the}} city as partly in ruins. For many years after the disappearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> of Eshmun, the sanctuary site {{was used as a}} quarry: Emir Fakhr-al-Din II, for example, used its massive blocks to build a bridge over the Awali river in the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|Back at Rome, Tiberius instituted the Sodales Augustales, a priesthood <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> of Augustus which Germanicus {{became a}} member of. When news arrived of his raid, Tiberius commemorated his {{services}} in the Senate with elaborate, but insincere praise: the proceedings gave him joy that the mutiny had been suppressed, but anxiety at the glory and popularity afforded to Germanicus. The Senate, in absence of Germanicus, voted {{that he should be}} given a triumph. Ovid's Fasti dates the Senate vote of Germanicus' triumph to 1 January AD 15.|$|E

5|$|Probably {{dating from}} St-Calais' {{time is the}} confraternity {{relationship}} between the monks of Durham and the monks of the monastery of Saint Calais in Maine.

5|$|The {{existence}} of early traditions of Jesus' birth in Bethlehem is attested by the Christian apologist Justin Martyr, who stated in his Dialogue with Trypho (c. 155–161) that the Holy Family had taken refuge {{in a cave}} outside of the town. Origen of Alexandria, writing around the year 247, referred to a cave {{in the town of}} Bethlehem which local people believed was the birthplace of Jesus. This cave was possibly one which had previously been a site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> of Tammuz.|$|E

50|$|Armstrongism {{is defined}} as a cult in Walter Martin's book, <b>The</b> Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cults</b> (1965). Martin argues that Armstrong's teachings are largely a {{conglomerate}} of teachings from other unorthodox groups, noting similarities in elements of his teachings to the Seventh Day Adventists (sabbatarianism, annihilationism, and soul sleep), Jehovah's Witnesses (denial <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bodily resurrection), and Mormonism (God Family doctrine).|$|R

5|$|After Joseph Stalin's death, {{the process}} of destalinization {{prompted}} debates about fundamental issues throughout the entire Eastern Bloc. Nikita Khrushchev's speech On the Personality Cult and its Consequences had wide implications outside the Soviet Union and in other communist countries. In Poland, {{in addition to the}} criticism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> of personality, popular topics of debate centered on the right to steer a more independent course of 'local, national socialism' instead of following the Soviet model down to every little detail; such views were seen in discussion and critique by many Polish United Workers' Party members of Stalin's execution of older Polish communists from Communist Party of Poland during the Great Purge.|$|E
5|$|After {{the move}} to Exeter, Leofric worked to {{increase}} the endowment of the diocese, and especially the cathedral library, which he found almost empty upon his arrival. He later claimed that there were only five books owned by the cathedral chapter when he became bishop. He still remained on good terms with the king, for he was present at Edward's Christmas court in 1065 that saw the consecration of Edward's Westminster Abbey church at Westminster. No evidence survives that Leofric was employed by the king in any diplomatic missions, nor does Leofric appear to have attended any papal councils or synods. He was a supporter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> of Leo IX, who was proclaimed a saint after Leo's death.|$|E
5|$|In August of 14 his {{grandfather}} Augustus died. In his honor, Drusus read a eulogy before the rostra at his funeral. The next month, on 17 September, the senate met to confirm {{his father as}} princeps. Among his first acts as emperor, Tiberius instituted the Sodales Augustales, a priesthood <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> of Augustus which members of the imperial family, such as Drusus, became a member of. This wasn't his first religious post though, {{as he had been}} a pontifex since AD 7/8 - an important step to the prestigious pontifex maximus. Since 14 May AD 14, {{he was a member of}} the Fratres Arvales as well.|$|E

He reforms <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> and helps to improve its relations with other sects. He becomes {{a key figure in}} leading the rebel forces to overthrow the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty.|$|R

25|$|Since {{the modern}} {{manufacturing}} process is unknown to them, members, leaders, and prophets <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cults</b> maintain that <b>the</b> manufactured goods <b>of</b> <b>the</b> non-native culture {{have been created}} by spiritual means, such as through their deities and ancestors. These goods are intended for the local indigenous people, but the foreigners have unfairly gained control of these objects through malice or mistake. Thus, a characteristic feature <b>of</b> cargo <b>cults</b> is <b>the</b> belief that spiritual agents will, at some future time, give much valuable cargo and desirable manufactured products to <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> members.|$|R
5|$|Iravan, {{also known}} as Iravat and Iravant, is a minor {{character}} from the Hindu epic of Mahabharata. The son of Pandava prince Arjuna (one of the main heroes of the Mahabharata) and the Naga princess Ulupi, Iravan is the central deity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> of Kuttantavar {{which is also the}} name commonly given to him in that cult—and {{plays a major role in}} the cult of Draupadi. Both these cults are of Tamil origin, from a region of the country where he is worshipped as a village deity and is known as Aravan. He is also a patron god of well-known transgender communities called ThiruNangai (also Aravani in Tamil, and Hijra throughout South Asia).|$|E
5|$|Malliswari is {{regarded}} as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> classic films of Telugu cinema. It {{is one of the}} earliest Telugu films making use of Indian art and architecture and was followed by films such as Sankarabharanam (1980), Meghasandesam (1982), Ananda Bhairavi (1983), Sagara Sangamam (1983), and Rudraveena (1988). It was also the first film script to be serialised in Vijayachitra magazine. During the film's screening in the United States, a few universities requested the film's script as a part of their film study curriculum. Narasimha Reddy considered Malliswari his best work as a filmmaker, and the film was recognised as such. Malliswari success led to Rama Rao's resurgence from a career slump. A 2004 Telugu film directed by K. Vijaya Bhaskar was also titled Malliswari and marked the debut of the British-Indian film actress Katrina Kaif in Telugu cinema.|$|E
5|$|Mary's {{investigation}} {{leads her}} to Jacqueline's secret husband, Gregory Ward (Hugh Beaumont); a failed poet, Jason Hoag (Erford Gage); and a mysterious psychiatrist, Dr. Louis Judd (Tom Conway). Jacqueline had been Judd's patient, seeking treatment for depression stemming from her {{membership in a}} Satanic cult called the Palladists. She was lured into joining the cult by her former co-workers. Mary enlists a private detective, Irving August (Lou Lubin), but he is stabbed to death while investigating at the La Sagesse headquarters. Judd eventually helps Mary locate Jacqueline, who has gone into hiding. Gregory Ward {{falls in love with}} Mary. Jacqueline is later kidnapped by the cult members and condemned to death for revealing the cult. She would be the seventh person so condemned since the founding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> (hence the film's title).|$|E

Characterized as a depressive, she was <b>the</b> owner <b>of</b> La Sagasse, a cosmetics company in Manhattan prior to her disappearance. Mary describes Jacqueline as tall and strikingly beautiful. After becoming involved with the Palladists and falling into a deep depression, Jacqueline confided in Dr. Judd about <b>the</b> <b>cult.</b> As a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cult's</b> strict rules about secrecy, it is mandated that she must die for revealing information about them.|$|R
50|$|As {{with every}} blood transaction, Gideon has to deliver <b>the</b> flask <b>of</b> blood to an agent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Night <b>Cult.</b> <b>The</b> meeting to perform this task {{happens to be}} in a storage room in the airport. When Gideon enters he is {{attacked}} by what looks like a ferocious demon, but is really an illusion-casting demon with very little power. Gideon defeats the demon and is made aware by <b>the</b> demon <b>of</b> how <b>the</b> Night <b>Cult</b> has sense that he would eventually betray them and their beliefs. This causes Gideon to finally start to search for some answers, and instead of going to Jamaica he goes to Nigeria, back to <b>the</b> sacred temple <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Night <b>Cult.</b>|$|R
50|$|From {{the history}} traced by Nilsson and Guthrie, the Mycenaean pantheon {{consisted}} of Minoan deities, {{but also of}} gods and goddesses who appear under different names with similar functions in East and West. Many of these names appearing in the Linear B inscriptions can be found later in classical Greece like Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Athena, Hermes, Eileithyia and Dionysos, but the etymology is <b>the</b> only evidence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cults.</b>|$|R
