5000|$|<b>Online</b> <b>book</b> buyers buy textbooks, and {{sometimes}} {{other types of}} books, {{with the aim of}} reselling them for a profit. Like <b>online</b> marketplaces, <b>online</b> <b>book</b> buyers operate year-round, giving students the opportunity to sell their books even when campus [...] "buyback" [...] periods are not in effect. Students enter the ISBN numbers of the books they wish to sell and receive a price quote or offer. These <b>online</b> <b>book</b> buyers often offer [...] "free shipping" [...] (which in actuality is built into the offer for the book), and allow students to sell multiple books to the same source. Because <b>online</b> <b>book</b> buyers are buying books for resale, the prices they offer may be lower than students can get on online marketplaces. However, their prices are competitive, and they tend to focus on the convenience of their service. Some even claim that buying used textbooks online and selling them to <b>online</b> <b>book</b> buyers has a lower total cost than even textbook rental services.|$|R
2500|$|Historically, {{publishing}} {{has been}} handled by publishers, {{with the history}} of self-publishing progressing slowly until the advent of computers brought us electronic publishing, which has been made evermore ubiquitous from the moment the world went online with the Internet. The establishment of the World Wide Web in 1989 soon propelled the website into a dominant medium of publishing, as websites are easily created by almost anyone with Internet access. The history of wikis started shortly thereafter, followed closely by the history of blogging. [...] Commercial publishing also progressed, as previously printed forms developed into online forms of publishing, distributing <b>online</b> <b>books,</b> online newspapers, and online magazines.|$|E
2500|$|The highest profile {{cases of}} {{apostasy}} in Tunisia {{were of the}} two atheist ex-Muslims Ghazi Beji and Jabeur Mejri, sentenced to 7.5 years in prison on 28 March 2012. They were prosecuted for expressing their views on Islam, the Quran and Muhammad on Facebook, blogs and in <b>online</b> <b>books,</b> which allegedly 'violated public order and morality'. Mejri wrote a treatise in English on Muhammad's supposedly violent and sexually immoral behaviour. When Mejri was arrested by police, he confessed and later claimed the confession was extracted under torture. He also claimed that his friend Beji had authored an antireligious book, The Illusion of Islam, in Arabic. Upon learning he, too, was sought by the police, Beji fled the country and reached Greece; he obtained political asylum in France on 12 June 2013. Mejri was pardoned by president Moncef Marzouki and left prison on 4 March 2014 after several human rights groups campaigned for his release under the slogan [...] "Free Jabeur". When Mejri wanted to accept Sweden's invitation to move there, he was again imprisoned for several months, however, after being accused of embezzling money from his former job by his ex-colleagues (who started bullying {{him as soon as}} they found out he was an atheist), a rumour spread by his former friend Beji (who felt betrayed by Mejri because he had outed him as an atheist).|$|E
