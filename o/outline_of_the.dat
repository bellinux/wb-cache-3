5|$|A broad <b>outline</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Norte Chico diet {{has been}} suggested. At Caral, the edible domesticated plants noted by Shady are squash, beans, lúcuma, guava, pacay (Inga feuillei), and sweet potato. Haas et al. noted the same foods in their survey further north, while adding avocado and achira. In 2013, good {{evidence}} for maize was also documented by Haas et al. (see below).|$|E
5|$|An <b>outline</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{origins of}} the {{parasitic}} life style has been proposed. Epithelial feeding monopisthocotyleans on fish hosts are basal in the Neodermata and were the first shift to parasitism from free living ancestors. The next evolutionary step was a dietary change from epithelium to blood. The last common ancestor of Digenea + Cestoda was monogenean and most likely sanguinivorous.|$|E

5|$|In 1978, the {{archaeologist}} {{and historian}} Patrick Healy discovered {{the remains of}} a prehistoric wedge tomb in the woods.

5|$|Jermaine, Manuel and I {{sat down}} and Jermaine {{programmed}} the drums. I told him the feel I wanted and Manuel {{put his hands on}} the keyboards and I started singing the melody.

5|$|The <b>outline</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{historical}} Stefan Lochner's {{life has}} been established from {{a small number of}} records, mostly relating to commissions, payments and property transfers. There are no documents relating to his early life, a contributing factor being the loss of archival records from his supposed birthplace during the French occupation of Cologne.|$|E

5|$|Whatever its origin, {{the giant}} {{has become an}} {{important}} part of the culture and folklore of Dorset. Some folk stories indicate that the image is an <b>outline</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corpse of a real giant. One story says the giant came from Denmark leading an invasion of the coast, and was beheaded by the people of Cerne Abbas while he slept on the hillside.|$|E

The faint <b>outline</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tsarist-Soviet imperium still glimmers in {{the collective}} steam off bowls of beetroot and cabbage in meat stock, and the soft sound of dollops of sour cream slipping into soup, from the Black Sea to the Sea of Japan and, in emigration, from Brooklyn to Berlin.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{property}} in the village is older than the early 17th century, its layout reflects its development in medieval times as a planned village. Eight toft compartments are discernible {{to the west of}} Main Street, and the <b>outline</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four surrounding common fields, now divided, may be identified from the pattern of dry stone walls. The fields were largely arable, providing the village with most of its food requirements, but are now farmed exclusively for pasture and hay. The village manor house was on land now occupied by Hebden Hall {{at the south end of}} Main Street.|$|E
5|$|By mid-2012, {{the merits}} of the ten routes had been considered, {{including}} the economic, environmental and technical issues involved, and a broad <b>outline</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corridor for the link was scheduled to be published in September. After that, consultation with landowners and stakeholders took place, to establish the final route, for which design of the channel and the associated locks, bridges, moorings and pumping stations could then begin.|$|E

5|$|Doremus based the storyline of {{the film}} partly on his own long-distance {{relationship}} with a woman living in London while he lived in Los Angeles. Rather than writing a traditional screenplay, he and Ben York Jones compiled a 50-page <b>outline</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film from which the actors improvised {{almost all of the}} dialogue. Filming took place over four weeks in Los Angeles and London with a budget of $250,000.|$|E
5|$|Gisborough Priory is characterised {{by a few}} {{highly visible}} remains. The priory church survives in a fragmentary state, {{dominated}} by the east wall of the presbytery that stands to its full height. Several of the priory church's column bases can also be seen, as can a number of excavated graves within the presbytery. Elsewhere on the site, the <b>outline</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cloister is visible but is largely unexcavated, while {{the ruins of the}} west (or cellarer's) range constitutes the largest area of other remains above ground. A ruined gatehouse and a still-intact dovecote (the latter off-limits to visitors) stand on the western edges of the site.|$|E
5|$|In 1538, {{the current}} walls of Jerusalem were {{completed}} on {{the orders of}} Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. These walls, along with the internal walls built by the Armenians, determined the <b>outline</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quarter. In the 1562–63 record, only 189 Armenians were counted, whereas 640 were counted by the Ottomans in 1690, an increase of 239%. According to the chronicler Simeon Lehatsi only some twelve Armenian families lived in Jerusalem in 1615–16. The {{significant increase in the}} population in 1690 is attributed to urbanization experienced by the Armenians and other Christians. Thus Armenians came to make up 22.9% of Jerusalem's Christians by 1690, becoming the second largest Christian community.|$|E

5|$|Laevistrombus {{canarium}} comprises {{at least}} two known subspecies; one is the nominate subspecies Laevistrombus canarium canarium, {{and the other is}} Laevistrombus canarium guidoi. L.canarium guidoi distinguishes itself from the other subspecies by its solid white colour, the <b>outline</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> posterior canal and a more prominent posteriorly protruding outer lip. The presence of a freely protruding lip at the posterior portion of the columella is also a distinctive character.|$|E
5|$|Most {{researchers}} have {{disagreed with the}} identification of the structures as collagen or other structural fibres. Notably, the team of scientists that reported the presence of pigmentation cells in the structures argued that their presence proved the structures were feathers, not collagen, because collagen does not contain pigment. Gregory S. Paul reidentified what the collagen hypothesis's proponents consider a body outline outside of the fibres as an artefact of preparation: breakage and brushed-on sealant have been misidentified as the <b>outline</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge is}} {{situated}} in a historically significant area. The northern end of the bridge covers part of the Jean Baptiste Point Du Sable Homesite, which is commemorated by a National Historic plaque in Pioneer Court. The southern half of the bridge passes over the site of Fort Dearborn, which was constructed in 1803. The Fort is commemorated by a large relief above {{the entrance of the}} London Guarantee Building, and brass markers positioned in the sidewalks {{on the south side of}} the bridge delineate the posited <b>outline</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original blockhouse.|$|E
