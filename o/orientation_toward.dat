40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2003 Teachers {{must work}} toward {{multiple}} goals, including both goals that they choose {{for themselves and}} goals that are assigned to them by administrators or policy-makers. To the extent that these two sets of goals diverge, teachers may experience goal conflict. This study investigated how goal conflict and two other variables (job satisfaction and perceived needs for increased autonomy) may influence teachers' motivational <b>orientations</b> <b>toward</b> teaching. Two dimensions of motivational orientation were examined separately, including motivational orientations toward: (1) innovation and creativity, and (2) external measures of success. Data were drawn from a survey of 366 elementary school teachers. Structural equation modeling revealed that relationships between the independent variables and teachers' motivational <b>orientations</b> <b>toward</b> teaching differ for the two dimensions of motivational orientation. Both job satisfaction and goal conflict are potentially important in predicting motivational <b>orientations</b> <b>toward</b> teaching. Implications {{for the work of}} teachers and administrators are discussed...|$|R

25|$|In June 1979, a cover {{article in}} The New Republic {{attacked}} AFSC for abandoning {{the tradition of}} pacifism. The criticisms became prominent after a gathering of Friends General Conference in Richmond, Indiana, {{in the summer of}} 1979 when many Friends joined with prominent leaders, such as Kenneth Boulding, to call for a firmer Quaker <b>orientation</b> <b>toward</b> public issues. Subsequent to the FGC Gathering, a letter listing the points of criticism was signed by 130 Friends and sent to the AFSC Board. In 1988, the book Peace and Revolution by conservative scholar Guenter Lewy repeated charges that AFSC had abandoned pacifism and religion. In response to Lewy's book, Chuck Fager published Quaker Service At The Crossroads in 1988.|$|E

In February 1947, Robbins read of a United States Army Air Forces plan to fly the P-82 Twin Mustang fighter Betty Jo nonstop from Honolulu, Hawaii, to New York City. He suggested that the Navy have a P2V-1 Neptune patrol plane take off from Honolulu within 30 minutes of the P-82s departure and beat the P-82 to New York in order to steal the days glory from the Army Air Forces, but the Navy did not follow up on his idea.|$|E
25|$|The early Roman army (c. 500 BC) was, {{like those}} of other {{contemporary}} city-states influenced by Greek civilization, a citizen militia which practiced hoplite tactics. It was small (the population of free males of military age was then about 9,000) and organized in five classes (in parallel to the comitia centuriata, the body of citizens organized politically), with three providing hoplites and two providing light infantry. The early Roman army was tactically limited and its stance during this period was essentially defensive. By the 3rd century BC, the Romans abandoned the hoplite formation {{in favor of a}} more flexible system in which smaller groups of 120 (or in some cases 60) men called maniples could maneuver more independently on the battlefield. Thirty maniples arranged in three lines with supporting troops constituted a legion, totaling between 4,000 and 5,000 men. The early Republican legion consisted of five sections, each of which was equipped differently and had different places in formation: the three lines of manipular heavy infantry (hastati, principes and triarii), a force of light infantry (velites), and the cavalry (equites). With the new organization came a new <b>orientation</b> <b>toward</b> the offensive and a much more aggressive posture toward adjoining city-states.|$|E

500|$|As {{a result}} of the <b>orientation</b> <b>toward</b> nuclear war, {{tactical}} air strikes were flown almost exclusively by the US Air Force between 1964 and 1966 using a variety of fighter bombers intended initially for the delivery of small strategic and tactical nuclear weapons. These types included the F-100 Super Sabre, F-4 Phantom II, and even the F-104 Starfighter. The F-100 had two fighter bomber variants in service at the time, the F-100C and F-100D, both of which were capable of carrying a nuclear store, and only the latter of which was primarily for use as a strike aircraft and not a fighter. The F-100C had largely been passed to the United States Air National Guard and by 1965 less than two hundred of the aircraft were capable of using cluster bombs or even the largely standard AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missile. [...] The F-104C, a fighter bomber version of another fighter, though capable of utilizing conventional air-to-ground stores, was intended as a nuclear weapon delivery platform. [...] Only the F-4C and F-4D were available as a true multirole aircraft, and the F-4C had still been used firstly as a fighter when deployed to the theater. [...] The only other major non-fighter type in use early on in the conflict was the B-57 Canberra. Strikes in Laos were even conducted for a time using the F-102 Delta Dagger, modified with infrared sensors, and using its internal rocket armament. These strikes proved largely fruitless and were quickly discontinued.|$|E

The findings reveal that the (in) consistency between senior management’s orientations and underlying assumptions of TQM is the major predictor when trying to explain the effectiveness of a TQM programme. Furthermore, the degree of consistency between middle and first line managers’ orientations towards TQM is significantly influcnced by senior management’s orinetations than any other factors. Together, these findings support the view that the degree of inconsistency between senior and middle managers’ <b>orientations</b> <b>toward</b> TQM can have serious detrimental effect on its success.

2500|$|When {{coming out}} is {{described}} as a gradual process or a journey, it is meant to include becoming aware of and acknowledging one's same-sex desires or gender identity. This preliminary stage, which involves soul-searching or a personal epiphany, is often called [...] "coming out to oneself" [...] and constitutes the start of self-acceptance. Many LGBT people say that this stage began for them during adolescence or childhood, when they first became aware of their sexual <b>orientation</b> <b>toward</b> members of the same sex. Coming out has also been described as a process because of a recurring need or desire to come out in new situations in which LGBT people are assumed to be heterosexual or cisgender, such as at a new job or with new acquaintances. As Diana Fuss (1991) explains, [...] "the problem of course with the inside/outside rhetoric...is that such polemics disguise {{the fact that most of}} us are both inside and outside at the same time".|$|E

In this brief paper we discuss the empirical evidence supporting the major classification of US political subcultures, that offered by Daniel Elazar. We then explore mass preferences regarding what types of personality traits are seen as most desirable for political candidates to hold – an important dimension in US presidential politics – finding clear regional variation across Elazar’s individualistic, moralistic and traditionalistic cultures...|$|R

2500|$|Relaxation therapy {{can reduce}} {{cognition}} and motivations to act out, and through relaxation, clients gain coping skills to better manage their anger. This therapy addresses {{various aspects of}} anger such as physiological, cognitive, behavioral, and social. These aspects combined are what make relaxation an effective treatment for anger. The mindfulness therapy technique attempts to teach clients acceptance of bodily sensations and emotions. Mindfulness originated in Eastern spiritual traditions that are practiced through meditation. A two-prong component of mindfulness includes: self-regulation and <b>orientation</b> <b>toward</b> the present moment. The center of this therapy technique is experiencing the present moment in a non-judgmental manner that is reflective of meditation. In practice, clients observe breathing, sitting and walking during meditations. The goal is for clients to understand {{that his or her}} thoughts of anger are merely thoughts rather than reality. Mindfulness is also a technique used in the relaxation approach, because the technique halts physiological arousal. Rational emotive behavior therapy explains anger through the client's beliefs and emotion, rather than the event itself. The concept involves clients interpreting events in a rational manner in order to avoid irrational thoughts that lead to anger. Delayed reaction technique is when clients attempt to uncover what is making them angry before acting out on their anger. This allows them to have time to change what is making them angry and increase time before their response; this encourages thought on a more rational level. In addition, clients are also encouraged to avoid demands in an anti-oppressive order to avoid anger. An example of a demand placed on a client may be that, [...] "I have to have this done by my standards". Research is starting to show that the better individuals understand what anger management is and how it can help them personally and in relationships, aggressive actions are less likely to occur.|$|E

[...] Expressing a similar sentiment, director Jonathan Green acknowledges that [...] "Che is turning over in his grave" [...] because of the commercialization; in Green's view, Che's visage also {{has the potential to be}} a [...] "Trojan horse" [...] of capitalist marketing, by embedding itself into pop iconography.

40|$|It is {{estimated}} {{that more than half}} of pediatric hospital emergency department (ED) visits are medically nonurgent. Anecdotal impressions suggest that ED providers castigate medically nonurgent visits, yet studies on such visits are scarce. This study explored the perspectives of 26 providers working in the EDs of two urban hospitals regarding medically nonurgent pediatric ED visits and advising parents or guardians on appropriate ED use. Three pro-vider ideologies regarding the appropriateness of medically nonurgent ED use were identi-fied and found to be linked to particular communication strategies that providers employed with ED users: restrictive, pragmatic, and all-inclusive. The analysis resulted in the devel-opment of a typology of provider ideological <b>orientations</b> <b>toward</b> ED use, distinguished according to different <b>orientations</b> <b>toward</b> professional dominance. As its name indicates, the hospital emergency department (ED) was originallycreated to provide immediate care for patients with life-threatening medical conditions, trauma, or injuries—not to treat minor illnesses or provide primary care.
