40|$|The Australian Government {{provides}} basic <b>operating</b> <b>grants</b> to universities, {{which are}} used to teach domestic undergraduate students. It imposes a productivity offset on the grants to encourage improvements in university productivity. But it is not transparent and does not vary across universities. Thus, universities {{have little incentive to}} improve performance. This paper develops an alternative framework that uses incentive regulation to allocate these grants to universities, which provides stronger incentives for universities to improve productivity. Regulators often use a similar framework to set prices for natural monopoly services such as utilities and public transport. Under incentive regulation, the basic <b>operating</b> <b>grants</b> could be reduced, on average, by 1. 76 % per annum over 5 years, which is about $ 100 million per annum. This finding is contrary to several recent Australian Government inquires that suggest the basic <b>operating</b> <b>grant</b> is inadequate and that this compromises the quality of undergraduate teaching...|$|R
5000|$|In 1995, the Nova Scotia Council on Higher Education (NSCHE) began {{a process}} to review and {{recommend}} a new Funding Formula for Nova Scotia's universities. This process attempted to acknowledge considerable changes in enrollment and new programs at several universities, and the new formula was approved by government for fiscal 1998-99. The new Funding Formula has two major components: Unrestricted <b>operating</b> <b>grants</b> (96%) and Restricted <b>operating</b> <b>grants</b> (4%). The Unrestricted <b>operating</b> <b>grants</b> are broken down into three components: the Weighted Enrolment Grant (WEG); the Research Grant and the Extra Formula Grants. The WEG accounts for approximately 91% of the total operating funding provided to universities. Extra Formula Grants take into consideration unique characteristics such as size; French-language instruction; part-time students; isolation (distance from Halifax). [...] The Memorandum of Understanding {{between the government and}} the universities were negotiated for 2004-08 and from 2008-2011 based on this funding model.|$|R
