Scenes showing Phil and Rainie taking the drug crack cocaine in 2010 prompted over 200 complaints from viewers who felt the scenes were inappropriate. The BBC responded by saying [...] "EastEnders in no way—and at no point—glamorises or condones the use of drugs, and furthermore we took great care to avoid any demonstration on how to prepare or take drugs. [...] We took care to signal the nature of the episode's content to viewers in advance through programme publicity and billings, and the BBC Action Line was trailed following the episode for anyone affected by the issue. In addition to this, our website includes links to organisations who can offer help and advice on this issue. [...] We worked closely with drug and alcohol charities, including Addaction and DrugScope, throughout the editorial process to ensure that we handled the storyline accurately and sensitively." [...] The Daily Mail asked some viewers about the scenes, including <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I was shocked at the content of the episode. The graphic detail of the drug use with Phil and his friend was terrible and in view of the time that the episode was aired, entirely inappropriate. Viewers do not need to see this kind of storyline. Please, BBC, no more of these horrid storylines." [...] Other viewers said, [...] "They look like they're having a good time. They're in danger of making it look appealing." [...] Finally, [...] "It was a bit much. I've found EastEnders distressing over the last month." [...] The Daily Record described the scenes as 'disturbing'.|$|E

2500|$|Rav and Samuel offered {{different}} {{explanations of}} the words in [...] "And the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made He a woman." [...] One said that this [...] "rib" [...] was a face, the other {{that it was a}} tail. In support of the <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>said</b> it was a face, [...] says, [...] "Behind and before have You formed me." [...] The <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>said</b> it was a tail explained the words, [...] "Behind and before have You formed me," [...] as Rabbi Ammi said, that humankind was [...] "behind," [...] that is, later, in the work of creation, and [...] "before" [...] in punishment. The Gemara conceded that humankind was last in the work of creation, for God created humankind {{on the eve of the}} Sabbath. But if when saying that humankind was first for punishment, one means the punishment in connection with the serpent, Rabbi taught that, in conferring honor the Bible commences with the greatest, in cursing with the least important. Thus, in cursing, God began with the least, cursing first the serpent, then the people. The punishment of the Flood must therefore be meant, as [...] says, [...] "And He blotted out every living substance which was upon the face of the ground, both man and cattle," [...] starting with the people. In support of the <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>said</b> that Eve was created from a face, in [...] the word , wa-yitzer is written with two yuds. But the <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>said</b> Eve was created from a tail explained the word , wa-yitzer as Rabbi Simeon ben Pazzi said, [...] "Woe is me because of my Creator (yotzri), woe is me because of my evil inclination (yitzri)!" [...] In support of the <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>said</b> that Eve was created from a face, [...] says, [...] "male and female created He them." [...] But the <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>said</b> Eve was created from a tail explained the words, [...] "male and female created He them," [...] as Rabbi Abbahu explained when he contrasted the words, [...] "male and female created He them," [...] in [...] with the words, [...] "in the image of God made He man," [...] in [...] Rabbi Abbahu reconciled these statements by teaching that at first God intended to create two, but in the end created only one. In support of the <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>said</b> that Eve was created from a face, [...] says, [...] "He closed up the place with flesh instead thereof." [...] But the <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>said</b> Eve was created from a tail explained the words, [...] "He closed up the place with flesh instead thereof," [...] as Rabbi Jeremiah (or as some say Rav Zebid, or others say Rav Nahman bar Isaac) said, that these words applied only to the place where God made the cut. In support of the <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>said</b> that Eve was created from a tail, [...] says, [...] "God built." [...] But the <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>said</b> that Eve was created from a face explained the words [...] "God built" [...] as explained by Rabbi Simeon ben Menasia, who interpreted the words, [...] "and the Lord built the rib," [...] to teach that God braided Eve's hair and brought her to Adam, for in the seacoast towns braiding (keli'ata) is called building (binyata). Alternatively, Rav Hisda said (or some say it was taught in a Baraita) that the words, [...] "and the Lord built the rib," [...] teach that God built Eve after the fashion of a storehouse, narrow at the top and broad at the bottom so as to hold the produce safely. So Rav Hisda taught that a woman is narrower above and broader below so as better to carry children.|$|E

Refuting the other’s argument, the <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>said</b> that they traveled in the shape of a beam read [...] "as they encamp, so shall they set forward," [...] to teach that just as the configuration of their camp was according to God’s Word, so the configuration of their journey was by God’s Word. While the <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>said</b> that they traveled in the shape of a box read [...] "the camp of the children of Dan, which was the rearward of all the camps," [...] to teach that Dan was more populous than the other camps, and would thus travel in the rear, and if anyone would lose any item, the camp of Dan would return it..

2500|$|Armenian {{national}} movement, {{also known}} as the [...] "Armenian revolutionary movement", was the Armenian national effort to re-establish an Armenian state in the historic Armenian homelands of eastern Asia Minor and the Transcaucasus. The decline of the Ottoman Empire in part was the result and in part the cause of rise of nationalism among various groups that made up the multi-ethnic and multi-religion Empire. The Russo-Turkish War, which resulted in the independence of Romania, Serbia and Montenegro, provided a model for other aspiring nationalists and revolutionaries. The Hinchak and Dashnak, Armenian revolutionary committees, were formed in Eastern provinces of the Ottoman Empire following the Berlin Treaty, which were very much under direct Russian threat. Yet, this is contrasted by Fâ'iz el-Ghusein, who stated, [...] "I have enquired of many Armenians whom I have met, but I have not found <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>said</b> that he desired political independence." ...|$|E
2500|$|All {{occupants}} of the ground floor were seriously injured. In the first-floor corridor, some occupants decided to {{lie down on the}} ground to show that they offered no resistance. Nonetheless, police beat them and kicked them when they arrived. Soon, there were police officers on all four floors of the building, kicking and battering prone occupants. In one corridor, police ordered a group of young men and women to kneel, so that they could batter them around the head and shoulders more easily. Here, Daniel Albrecht, a 21-year-old cello student from Berlin, had his head beaten so badly that he needed surgery to stop bleeding in his brain. The police also used humiliation to cow the {{occupants of}} the school. An officer who stood spread-legged in front of a kneeling and injured woman, grabbed his groin and thrust it into her face.

2500|$|Rabbi Hama bar Hanina {{interpreted}} the words [...] "the plaited ( [...] , serad) garments for ministering {{in the holy}} place" [...] in [...] to teach that but for the priestly garments described in [...] (and the atonement achieved by the garments or the priests who wore them), no remnant ( [...] , sarid) of the Jews would have survived. Similarly, citing [...] Rabbi Simon taught that even as the sacrifices had an atoning power, so too did the priestly garments. Rabbi Simon explained that the priests' tunic atoned for those who wore a mixture of wool and linen ( [...] , shaatnez, prohibited by [...] ), as [...] says, [...] "And he made him a coat (tunic) of many colors" [...] (and the Jerusalem Talmud explained that Joseph's coat was similar to one made of the forbidden mixture). The breeches atoned for unchastity, as [...] says, [...] "And you shall make them linen breeches to cover the flesh of their nakedness." [...] The miter atoned for arrogance, as [...] says, [...] "And you shall set the miter on his head." [...] Some said that the girdle atoned for the crooked in heart, and others said for thieves. Rabbi Levi said that the girdle was 32 cubits long (about 48 feet), and that the priest wound it towards the front and towards the back, {{and this was the}} ground for saying that it was to atone for the crooked in heart (as the numerical value of the Hebrew word for heart is 32). The <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>said</b> that the girdle atoned for thieves argued that since the girdle was hollow, it resembled thieves, who do their work in secret, hiding their stolen goods in hollows and caves. The breastplate atoned for those who pervert justice, as [...] says, [...] "And you shall put in the breastplate of judgment." [...] The Ephod atoned for idol-worshippers, as [...] says, [...] "and without Ephod or teraphim."
