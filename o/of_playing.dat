40|$|In {{this paper}} I first address the {{problems}} that arise when we pose the question <b>of</b> what the <b>play</b> is. Where, may we hope to find {{the answer to the}} question of what constitutes the essence <b>of</b> <b>play?</b> By reconsidering Gadamer’s critique of Kant’s concept <b>of</b> <b>play</b> and by engaging with Gadamer’s methodological assumptions, I argue for the importance of staying with our actual experience <b>of</b> <b>play.</b> In characterizing the experience of how it is to play, I try to locate the evidence of the essence <b>of</b> <b>play</b> as it manifests itself in this experience. In the experience <b>of</b> <b>play,</b> we are lead into the turned-in-on-itself world <b>of</b> <b>play,</b> which is the only world for the player. The latter is immersed in the aimless to-and-froing <b>of</b> <b>play</b> which happens as a perpetual self-renewal, making the rules of the game and every possible aim inside the world <b>of</b> <b>play</b> the medium <b>of</b> <b>play</b> itself...|$|R

50|$|Interestingly, {{the above}} line <b>of</b> <b>play</b> {{starting}} with the deep finesse also fails to optimise the matchpoint objective as it gets beaten by another line <b>of</b> <b>play.</b> In turns {{out that there are}} a total of eight lines <b>of</b> <b>play</b> that are non-transitive: the eight lines <b>of</b> <b>play</b> can be thought to be placed on a circle such that each line <b>of</b> <b>play</b> beats its left neighbor. As a result, the optimal approach {{in the context of the}} matchpoint objective corresponds to a so-called mixed strategy and is probabilistic in nature: the declarer has to select randomly one of the eight lines <b>of</b> <b>play.</b>|$|R

40|$|Publisher東京論文The notion <b>of</b> <b>play</b> {{encompasses}} {{a wide range}} of activities such as card games, digital games, hobbies, and sports. Although we consider such playful activities to be ordinary these days, the explicit meaning <b>of</b> <b>play</b> or difference between play and game is unclear. This paper attempts to understand the historical changes in the meaning <b>of</b> <b>play</b> that can be found in academic discourse in order to explore a new direction <b>of</b> <b>play</b> study within sociological contexts. By reviewing the various theories <b>of</b> both <b>play</b> and game, we can come {{to a better understanding of}} how the notions <b>of</b> <b>play</b> differ between English and Japanese because Japanese lacks an explicit translation for the words "game" and "ludic. " To achieve this outcome, we must first adjust the main difference between the two languages. Furthermore, this paper elucidates that sociology in Europe and the United States has focused on "game" to understand play. In contrast, Japanese sociology refers to neither game nor play, instead distinguishes between leisure and work. This paper seeks to bridge the gaps between the understanding <b>of</b> <b>play</b> and game in English and Japanese. In addition, this paper investigates the significant shift in the meaning <b>of</b> <b>play</b> and game brought about by the recent information technology revolution. It shows that the development of digital games can be seen as a starting point to form a new definition <b>of</b> <b>play</b> and game from interdisciplinary perspectives. In this phenomenon, new play researchers have begun to define play and game. This paper also reviews some definitions <b>of</b> <b>play</b> and game used in digital technologies and introduces the new direction <b>of</b> <b>play</b> and game studies, such as "Ludology. " Finally, by locating digital games as the central subject <b>of</b> <b>play</b> research, new definitions <b>of</b> <b>play</b> and game de-emphasize the division between play and work seen in previous sociological research...|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews Piaget's stages <b>of</b> <b>play</b> and {{discusses}} the implications <b>of</b> <b>play</b> for early childhood education. The three stages <b>of</b> <b>play</b> identified in Piaget's research are: (1) practice play, (2) symbolic or make believe play and (3) games with rules. The characteristics {{of each type}} <b>of</b> <b>play</b> are presented and examples <b>of</b> <b>play</b> at each stage are given. The relationship between each stage <b>of</b> <b>play</b> and the individual's cognitive developMent is then discussed in detail. Also discussed are three factors that influence the quality, quantity and nature <b>of</b> children's <b>play</b> (1) materials/environments, (2) peer interaction and (3) [...] adult guidance. The match of the child's present developmental abilities to the activities in the environment is identified {{as the most important}} aspect of planning for children's play.

40|$|This article {{reviews the}} current {{literature}} on play and play assessment in occupational therapy. The concept <b>of</b> <b>play</b> and play theories are examined and reasons are investigated {{for the low}} use <b>of</b> <b>play</b> assessment in paediatric occupational therapy practice. Within contemporary occupational therapy practice, the concept <b>of</b> <b>play</b> is being readdressed and play behaviour is understood {{to be important in}} child development. Available assessments <b>of</b> <b>play</b> in occupational therapy assess the child in a familiar environment to the child. Since many paediatric occupational therapists work in clinical settings, it is concluded that a clinically viable assessment <b>of</b> observation <b>of</b> <b>play</b> behaviour is required within occupational therapy.

40|$|The {{following}} {{study examines}} two researchers’ perspectives on {{play in the}} lives of children from diverse cultural contexts. Two questions guided this study: (1) how do researchers conceptualize children’s play and (2) what shapes their understanding <b>of</b> <b>play.</b> In order to answer these questions, a critical discourse was established between two researchers who had each completed ethnographic studies <b>of</b> <b>play</b> in the UK and Jamaica. The initial research studies comprised of observations, semi-structured interviews, field notes and collection of artefacts relating to play. Through discourse, new understandings were unearthed by examining the different contexts <b>of</b> <b>play.</b> The aim <b>of</b> this study is to contextualize our understanding <b>of</b> <b>play</b> and to expand our notions <b>of</b> <b>play</b> beyond researcher positionalities. This discursive method allows concepts <b>of</b> <b>play</b> to be grounded, but not restricted by national contexts through juxtaposition with multinational policies, programmes and practices...|$|R
