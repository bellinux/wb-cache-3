5|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, the Farrars {{were living in}} Cincinnati, Ohio. During this time Green {{suffered}} a number of medical issues, including surgery on an infected wrist, cerebellar migraines, and insomnia.

5|$|Shortly after Ferrier's death {{an appeal}} was {{launched}} by Barbirolli, Walter, Myra Hess and others, {{to establish a}} cancer research fund in Ferrier's name. Donations were received {{from all over the}} world. To publicise the fund a special concert was given at the Royal Festival Hall on 7 May 1954, at which Barbirolli and Walter shared the conducting duties without payment. Among the items was a rendition of Purcell's When I am laid in earth, which Ferrier had often sung; on this occasion the vocal part was played by a solo cor anglais. The Kathleen Ferrier Cancer Research Fund helped establish the Kathleen Ferrier Chair of Clinical <b>Oncology</b> at University College Hospital, in 1984. , it was continuing to fund <b>oncology</b> research.|$|E

5|$|Two years later, {{a second}} child, Kate, was born. Green again {{returned}} to her studies after maternity leave, and by 1985 had completed her fellowship. She went into private practice in hematology and <b>oncology</b> while Farrar finished {{the last year of}} his cardiology fellowship. Later Green and Farrar both joined established medical practices in the Kansas City, Missouri, area. After a year, Green started her own private practice, which prospered until she became pregnant and took time off work for another maternity leave. The couple's third child, Kelly, was born on December 13, 1988.|$|E
5|$|Verma {{received}} his D.Phil. in medical <b>oncology</b> from the University of Oxford, {{and has worked}} in the areas of signal transduction in cancer and on molecular biology applications in wildlife conservation.

5|$|Adewole has {{received}} several fellowship awards, {{such as the}} fellowship of the Nigerian Academy of Science, the National Postgraduate Medical College of Nigeria, and fellowship of the West African College of Surgeons. He {{is a member of}} several academic organisations such as the American Society of Clinical <b>Oncology,</b> International Agency for Research on Cancer, Nigerian Medical Association, International AIDS Society, International AIDS Society, International Society for Infectious Diseases, and the Society of Gynaecology and Obstetrics of Nigeria.

5|$|Although {{international}} agreement on staging (INSS) has been used, {{the need for}} an international consensus on risk assignment has also been recognized in order to compare similar cohorts in results of studies. Beginning in 2005, representatives of the major pediatric <b>oncology</b> cooperative groups have met to review data for 8,800 neuroblastoma patients treated in Europe, Japan, USA, Canada, and Australia between 1990 and 2002. This task force has proposed the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) classification system. Retrospective studies revealed the high survival rate of 12–18 month old age group, previously categorized as high-risk, and prompted the decision to reclassify 12–18 month old children without N-myc (also commonly referred to as MYCN) amplification to intermediate risk category.|$|E
5|$|CPAs {{have been}} {{implemented}} {{for the management of}} a plethora of chronic disease states, including diabetes mellitus, asthma, and hypertension. Evidence suggests that CPAs have resulted in beneficial health outcomes for patients involved. It has been shown that pharmacists working with providers under CPAs help deliver higher quality of care in the setting of psychiatry to promote medication adherence, managing venous thromboembolism in outpatient clinics, and in the <b>oncology</b> setting, including the management of antiemetic (anti-vomiting) therapy. Within these settings, CPAs have resulted in improved attainment of goal laboratory values like hemoglobin A1c for diabetics, improved lung function for asthmatics, and improved blood pressure control for people with hypertension.|$|E
5|$|There are six {{hospitals}} in Nablus, {{the four major}} ones being al-Ittihad, St. Lukes, al-Watani(the National) and the Rafidia Surgery Hospital. The latter, located in Rafidia, a suburb in western Nablus, is the largest hospital in the city. Al-Watani Hospital specializes in <b>oncology</b> services. The Anglican St. Lukes hospital and the National Hospital were built in 1900 and 1910 respectively. In addition to hospitals, Nablus contains the al-Rahma and at-Tadamon clinics, the al-Razi medical center, the Amal Center for Rehabilitation and 68 pharmacies. In addition to that, in 2001, Nablus Speciality Hospital was built, {{in which it is}} specialized in open heart surgery, angiograms and angioplasties.|$|E
5|$|With current treatments, {{patients}} with low and intermediate risk disease {{have an excellent}} prognosis with cure rates above 90% for low risk and 70–90% for intermediate risk. In contrast, therapy for high-risk neuroblastoma {{the past two decades}} resulted in cures only about 30% of the time. The addition of antibody therapy has raised survival rates for high-risk disease significantly. In March 2009 an early analysis of a Children's <b>Oncology</b> Group (COG) study with 226 high-risk patients showed that two years after stem cell transplant 66% of the group randomized to receive ch14.18 antibody with GM-CSF and IL-2 were alive and disease-free compared to only 46% in the group that did not receive the antibody. The randomization was stopped so all patients enrolling on the trial will receive the antibody therapy.|$|E

This rapid growth in demand for monoclonal antibody production has been well accommodated by the industrialization of mAb manufacturing.|$|E
