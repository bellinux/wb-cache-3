In aggregation, such data could be applied towards solving the problems of accident prevention, vehicular safety, and driving efficiency.

Our framework is low-capital, low-maintenance, and flexible enough to handle several types of data requests. In our evaluation, the framework achieves within 2 % accuracy for data collection at 1 -second interval when compared to an externally calculated benchmark. We also simulate data collection under non-ideal conditions and methodically characterize the drift of accuracy as total percentage of packet loss rises for different patterns of data loss; in our experiment, we conclude that for our sampled data, dropped blocks have the greatest impact on accuracy [...] by Chenxia Liu.

40|$|Neutrino Astronomy aims to scientifically exploit neutrinos {{as a new}} cosmic {{messenger}} {{to explore}} high energy astrophysical phenomena in the TeV-PeV energy range. The very low fluxes and the small interaction crosssection of neutrinos with matter require the construction of massive detectors. When the incoming neutrino direction can be reconstructed with a reasonable angular accuracy, the detector is dubbed "telescope", since the neutrinos, having no electric charge, point back to their source. In the Cherenkov technique, the observation of the neutrino is carried out through the detection of the Cherenkov light induced by the charged relativistic particles produced in the neutrino interaction with matter, mainly the muon {{in the case of}} the charged current interactions of muon neutrinos. From the arrival time and position of the detected Cherenkov photons induced by those secondary particles which cross the medium where the detector is located, information on the neutrino direction and energy can be inferred. Since the optical properties of the medium in which the telescope is located determine the transmission of the Cherenkov photons, a proper understanding of the influence of these properties in the track reconstruction and detector performance is required. The ANTARES deep-sea neutrino detector is the first fully operational undersea neutrino telescope in the Northern Hemisphere. It consists in a three-dimensional layout of 885 photomultipliers (PMTs) arranged in 12 detection lines plus one instrumentation line. Each detection line has 25 storeys, each of them containing triplets of PMTs housed in optical modules (OMs) and independent modules with the associated electronics. Some of these storeys are equipped with extra devices for time calibration and positioning of the detector. The Optical Beacon system, in particular, was designed for the in-situ time calibration of the apparatus, i. e. for the proper synchronization of its OMs. Although originally designed to this end, the <b>OB</b> <b>system</b> can be used to have a handle on the optical properties of the surrounding water. The objective of this thesis is to characterize the ANTARES detection medium. In this sense, some optical properties of the water namely, transmission, absorption and effective scattering lengths are measured with the <b>OB</b> <b>system.</b> Additionally, a complementary study on how such properties influence the reconstruction of tracks and the detector performance is carried out. To reach this goal, special calibration runs were commissioned and new instruments for water properties measurements were built and operated, e. g. the multiwavelength beacon and the nano-beacons. The tuning of the operating parameters and the handling of such devices once installed in the detector were also tasks performed during this work to achieve the aforementioned goal. Likewise, the development of specialised software codes for calibration and physical analyses together with the production of large simulation samples were, in addition, an important part of this work...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} acute {{exposure}} to cold on {{the expression of}} the ob (obese) gene, which encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the regulation of energy balance and body weight, has been examined in epididymal white adipose tissue of mice. Overnight (18 h) exposure of mice to a temperature of 4 degrees C led to the disappearance of ob mRNA in epididymal white fat, and subsequent studies showed that a cold-induced loss of ob mRNA could occur in as little as 2 - 4 h of exposure to 4 degrees C. When mice exposed to cold for 18 h were returned to the warm (24 degrees C), there was a rapid stimulation of {{the expression of the}} ob gene, the mRNA returning within 2. 5 h. Administration of noradrenaline led to a reduction in the level of ob mRNA in mice maintained in the warm, while isoprenaline resulted in the disappearance of the mRNA; these changes in ob mRNA were paralleled by similar changes in lipoprotein lipase mRNA. In contrast to white fat, the level of lipoprotein lipase mRNA in brown adipose tissue was increased by noradrenaline and isoprenaline. It is concluded that there is a cold-induced suppression of ob gene expression in white adipose tissue of mice and that this is mediated primarily by the sympathetic system. The profound effect of cold on ob gene expression indicates that the <b>ob</b> <b>system</b> relates to energy expenditure, as well as to satiety...|$|R

First determinations of orbital periods were made for HD 92206 C (2. 022 d), HD 112244 (27. 665 d), HD 164438 (10. 25 d), HD 123056 A (~ 1314 d) and HD 123056 B (< 2 d); the orbital period of HD 318015 could be improved (23. 445975 d). Concerning multiplicity, a third component was discovered for HD 92206 C by means of He I line profiles. For HD 93146 A, which was hitherto assumed to be SB 1, lines of a secondary component could be discerned. HD 123056 {{turns out to be a}} multiple system consisting of a high-mass component A (~ O 8. 5) displaying a broad He II 5411 A feature with variable radial velocity, and of an inner pair B (~ B 0) with double He I lines. The binary HD 164816 was revisited and some of its system parameters were improved. In particular, we determined its systemic velocity to be - 7 km/s, which coincides with the radial velocity of the cluster NGC 6530. This fact, together with its distance, suggests the cluster membership of HD 164816.

40|$|In mammals, new neurons are {{generated}} {{throughout the entire}} lifespan in two restricted areas of the brain, the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone (SVZ) – olfactory bulb (<b>OB)</b> <b>system.</b> In both regions newborn neurons display unique properties that clearly distinguish them from mature neurons. Enhanced excitability and increased synaptic plasticity enables them to add specific properties to information processing by modulating the existing local circuitry of already established mature neurons. Hippocampal neurogenesis has been suggested {{to play a role}} in spatial-navigation learning, spatial memory and spatial pattern separation. Cumulative evidences implicate that adult-born OB neurons contribute to learning processes and odor memory. We recently demonstrated that the cell fate determinant TRIM 32 is upregulated in differentiating neuroblasts of the SVZ-OB system in the adult mouse brain. The absence of TRIM 32 leads to increased progenitor cell proliferation and less cell death. Both effects accumulate in an overproduction of adult-generated OB neurons. Here, we present novel data from behavioral studies showing that such an enhancement of OB neurogenesis not necessarily leads to increased olfactory performance but in contrast even results in impaired olfactory capabilities. In addition, we show at the cellular level that TRIM 32 protein levels increase during differentiation of neural stem cells. At the molecular level, several metabolic intermediates that are connected to glycolysis, glycine or cysteine metabolism are deregulated in TRIM 32 knockout mice brain tissue. These metabolomics pathways are directly or indirectly linked to anxiety or depression like behavior. In summary, our study provides comprehensive data on how the impairment of neurogenesis caused by the loss of the cell fate determinant TRIM 32 causes a decrease of olfactory performance as well as a deregulation of metabolomic pathways that are linked to mood disorders...|$|R

Comparisons were made using One Up Bond F (<b>OB)</b> self-etching adhesive <b>system,</b> Single Bond (SB) one-bottle adhesive system and Scotchbond Multi Purpose Plus (SMP) bonding component. Thirty bovine incisors were extracted and decoronated at the cementoenamel junction. The labial surfaces were ground so that superficial dentin and deep dentin were exposed. The specimens were randomized to three groups (n= 10) : G 1 - OB; G 2 - OB + SMP; G 3 - SB. In G 2, a layer of the SMP bonding was applied over the <b>OB</b> adhesive <b>system.</b> Indirect composite restorations were bonded using dual-cure cement under 500 g load for 5 min. The specimens were serially sectioned with a bonding area of ± 1. 0 mm² in 3 regions: enamel (E), superficial dentin (SD) and deep dentin (DD). The sticks were fixed with cyanoacrylate adhesive and submitted to µTBS test at a crosshead speed of 0. 5 mm/min in a mechanical testing machine (EMIC DL 2000). The fractured specimens were examined under scanning electron microscopy to determine the failure mode. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's test (p< 0. 05). µTBS means (in MPa) were: G 1 /E: 15. 5 ± 3. 5 b; G 1 /SD: 22. 7 ± 7. 6 a; G 1 /DD: 19. 4 ± 9. 4 a; G 2 /E: 15. 9 ± 5. 8 b; G 2 /SD: 19. 9 ± 6. 9 a; G 2 /DD: 15. 3 ± 4. 9 a; G 3 /E: 23. 2 ± 7. 3 a; G 3 /SD: 20. 4 ± 8. 2 a; G 3 /DD: 19. 1 ± 8. 7 a.

40|$|Leptin (Ob) is {{a hormone}} that acts through the {{activation}} of the specific receptor Ob-R. It is mainly secreted by visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue and represents the first known adipokine [1]. Ob is a pleiotropic molecule and {{plays an important role}} in the skin, where it stimulates keratinocytes to proliferate and intervenes in the regulation of wound healing processes. It also participates in the control of hair follicle morphogenesis and its cycles of growth, regression, and rest [2]. Ob may act through endocrine, paracrine and autocrine mechanisms. While it is secreted by skin structures including epidermis and hair follicles, intradermal adipose tissue also seems to have a role in Ob secretion and accordingly in the control of the hair follicle cycle in mice and humans [3]. In this work, the morphological characteristics of the skin in bovine species were evaluated by Hematoxylin-Eosin and Oil Red O stainings to investigate the presence and extension of intradermal adipose tissue that may be invoved in Ob secretion. Moreover, Ob and Ob-R expression were analized by means of RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Through the morphological analysis, a high and thick dermis without adipocytes was observed. Hair follicles and glands were located in the prossimal part of the skin, beneath the epidermis, while a thick layer of connective tissue, lacking adipose cells, separated these structures by subcutis. RT-PCR gave a positive outcome, evidencing the transcripts for both molecules in the bovine skin samples examined By immunohistochemistry, Ob and its receptor were observed in the epidermis and in the outer root sheath of hair follicles during the follicular cycle. The epidermis abundantly expressed Ob; while all layers of cells were involved, the suprabasal layers expressed a stronger signal. Ob-R was observed in the cells of the basal layer. As regards hair follicles, both Ob and Ob-R were expressed by the outer root sheath of hair follicles. Staining mainly extended into the regions of the infundibulum and isthmus while the bulb was negative. Immunostaining persisted in all stages of hair follicles. The expression of Ob-R in the bovine skin proves that Ob acts on this peripheral organ. The identification of Ob in the epidermis and hair follicle epithelium attests that Ob may act through a paracrine and autocrine mechanism on these structures even if an endocrine mechanism cannot be excluded. The absence of adipocytes around hair follicles and, broadly, in all the dermis indicates that the intradermal adipose tissue does not exist in bovine and accordingly cannot exert paracrine control on the hair follicle. The identification of the <b>Ob</b> <b>system</b> in bovine skin provides important information for properly understanding the biological mechanisms that regulate skin structures, and well as for comparing animal species and highlighting their differences...|$|R

To investigate the nova progenitor, we used the data from the Digital Sky Survey and amateur photos available on the internet. In the period between April 1993 and July 2014, the brightness of the progenitor gradually increased by 2. 2 mag in the V band. At the peak of the first outburst in mid-November of 2014, the star reached an absolute visual magnitude of - 12. 75 mag but was discovered later, in February 2015, in a repeated outburst at the absolute magnitude of - 11. 65 mag. The amplitude of the outburst was minimum among the red novae, only 5. 6 mag in the V band. The H alpha emission line and the continuum of a cool supergiant with a gradually decreasing surface temperature were observed in the spectra. Such process is typical for red novae, although the object under study showed extreme parameters: maximum luminosity, maximum outburst duration, minimum outburst amplitude, unusual shape of the light curve.

40|$|We {{show that}} the FIX type theory {{introduced}} by Crole and Pitts [3] can be encoded in variants of Abadi and Cardelli's object calculi. More precisely, we {{show that the}} FIX type theory presented with judgements of both equality and operational reduction can be translated into object calculi, and the translation proved sound. In the case of operational reductions, we introduce a variant of Abadi and Cardelli's <b>system</b> <b>Ob</b> ¯. The payoff is a programme in which the general procedure for encoding type theories in object calculi can be seen clearly [...] -we encapsulate this as a principle; and more particularly, we show that computation types and the fixpoint type can be encoded. This is a direct contribution {{to the theory of}} objects, and moreover these translations will be useful to those involved with the automation of operational semantics.

40|$|The {{orbital motion}} of {{a neutron star}} about its optical {{companion}} presents a window through which to study the orbital parameters of that binary system. This has been used extensively in the Milky Way to calculate these parameters for several high-mass X-ray binaries. Using several years of RXTE PCA data, we derive the orbital parameters of four Be/X-ray binary systems in the SMC, {{increasing the number of}} systems with orbital solutions by a factor of three. We find one new orbital period, confirm a second and discuss the parameters with comparison to the Galactic systems. Despite the low metallicity in the SMC, these binary systems sit amongst the Galactic distribution of orbital periods and eccentricities, suggesting that metallicity may not {{play an important role in}} the evolution of high-mass X-ray binary systems. A plot of orbital period against eccentricity shows that the supergiant, Be and low eccentricity <b>OB</b> transient <b>systems</b> occupy separate regions of the parameter space; akin to the separated regions on the Corbet diagram. Using a Spearman's rank correlation test, we also find a possible correlation between the two parameters. The mass functions, inclinations and orbital semimajor axes are derived for the SMC systems based on the binary parameters and the spectral classification of the optical counterpart. As a by-product of our work, we present a catalogue of the orbital parameters for every high-mass X-ray binary in the Galaxy and Magellanic Clouds for which they are known.

40|$|Prenatal {{lipopolysaccharide}} (LPS) exposure causes reproductive, {{behavioral and}} neurochemical defects in both dams and pups. The present study evaluated male rats prenatally treated with LPS for behavioral and neurological effects {{related to the}} olfactory system, which is the main sensorial path in rodents. Pregnant Wistar rats received 100 mu g/kg of LPS intraperitoneally (i. p.) on gestational day (GD) 9. 5, and maternal behavior was evaluated. Pups were evaluated for (1) maternal odor preference, (2) aversion to cat odor, (3) monoamine levels and turnover in the olfactory bulb (OB) and (4) protein expression (via immunoblotting) within the <b>OB</b> dopaminergic <b>system</b> and glial cells. Results showed that prenatal LPS exposure impaired maternal preference and cat odor aversion and decreased dopamine (DA) levels in the OB. This dopaminergic impairment {{may have been due}} to defects in another brain area given that protein expression of the first enzyme in the DA biosynthetic pathway was unchanged in the OB. Moreover, there was no change in the protein expression of the DA receptors. The fact that the number of astrocytes and microglia was not increased suggests that prenatal LPS did not induce neuroinflammation in the OB. Furthermore, given that maternal care was not impaired, abnormalities in the offspring were not the result of reduced maternal care. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The aim is to develop the approaches and methods for evaluation of the land resources securing the land use rationalization in the specific conditions of Ob North. The criterion and system of the indices for evaluation of the land resources in conditions of North have been substantiated. The approaches to the integrated ecological-geographical eveluation of the land resources have been generalized. The classification has been made, and the typology of the vegetable associations taking their productivity has been proposed. The value of the compensation payments at derivation of the non-agricultural lands has been determined, and the model of the large-scale bioresource map has been created.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{properties}} of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars is a very intense outflow of gas. No less than 40 % of WR stars belong to binary systems. Young massive O and B stars are the secondary components of such <b>systems.</b> <b>OB</b> stars also have an intense stellar wind. If the intensities of the stellar winds of WR and OB stars {{are more or less}} comparable or if the distance between the components of the binary is large enough, the winds flowing out of WR and OB stars can collide and the shock waves are formed. In the shock the gas is heated to temperature ∼ 10 ^ 7 K and generates X-ray emission. Stellar wind collision may be responsible not only for the X-ray emission of WR + OB binaries and for their radio, IR and γ-ray emision as well. Stellar wind collision, gas heating, particle acceleration, and generation of X-ray, γ-ray, radio and IR emission in WR + OB binaries are discussed.

40|$|Abstract. Using {{adaptive}} optics we study the binary {{population in the}} nearby OB association Scorpius OB 2. We present the first results of our near-infrared {{adaptive optics}} survey among 199 (mainly) A- and B-type stars in Sco OB 2. In total 151 components other than the target stars are found, out of which 77 are probably background stars. Our findings are compared with data collected from literature. Out of the remaining 74 candidate physical companions 42 are new, demonstrating that many stars A/B stars have faint, close companions. 1 The primordial binary population in Sco OB 2 The primordial binary population (PBP) {{is defined as the}} population of binaries as established just after the gas has been removed from the forming system, i. e. when the stars can no longer accrete gas from their surroundings [3]. Characterizing the PBP is important for our understanding of the process of star formation, the formation and evolution of OB associations, the origin of the field star population and OB runaway stars, and the production and evolution of binary <b>systems.</b> <b>OB</b> associations are ideal sites {{for the study of the}} PBP.
