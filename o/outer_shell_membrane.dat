40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} the biological {{meaning of the}} asymmetrical shape in avian reproduction using quail. During the incubation of eggs, water was gradually lost and the air chamber which appeared in between the inner and <b>outer</b> <b>shell</b> <b>membranes</b> at the blunt end expanded, so that the angle made by the long egg-axis and the horizontal line increased, presumably because the centre of gravity of the egg contents moved toward the sharp end. The increase in angle occurred in both fertile and infertile eggs, suggesting that this phenomenon occurs irrespective of fertility and {{is due to the}} asymmetrical shape. The increase in the volume of the air chamber resulted in an increase {{in the area of the}} inner <b>shell</b> <b>membrane</b> at the chamber to satisfy the amount of gas exchange needed by the developing embryo for better hatching. We isolated a 300 -kDa protein from the inner <b>shell</b> <b>membrane.</b> It was produced by cells in the luminal epithelium of the oviductal isthmus and was found in the cortex of the fibres of <b>shell</b> <b>membranes</b> and a lining surrounding the air chamber. The lining comprised a medial layer between the inner and <b>outer</b> <b>shell</b> <b>membranes</b> in uterine eggs. The asymmetrical ellipsoid produces the air chamber at the blunt end of the avian egg during its sojourn in the oviductal isthmus, to maintain the blunt end up after oviposition and to raise that end during incubation in a dry environment, leading to high hatchability...|$|R

40|$|The {{structure}} of the hen 2 ̆ 7 s egg shell {{can be divided into}} five separate layers. The Innermost layer consists of two distinct membranes known as the inner and <b>outer</b> <b>shell</b> <b>membranes.</b> These membranes are compos ed of networks of protein/polysaccharide fibres and are = 70 mm thick. Attached to the outer fibres of the outer membrane are polycrystals of calcite (calcium carbonate) which extend outward in an inverse conical manner until the cones from several sites of crystal i nit iation fuse together. The fibre/ crystal attachment sites, known as basal caps, and the cones form the mammillary knobs layer which is :: 100 - 110 llm thick. After the cones fuse with each other, continuing calcite deposition produces columnar crystals 10 - 30 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 m in diameter and ::: 200 llm in length. These crys tals form the palisade layer and are intermingled with a protein/polysaccharide matrix that differs in composition From the <b>shell</b> <b>membranes.</b> Over the columnar crystals is a thin layer (::S - 8 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 m thick), known as the vertical crystal layer, of small calcite crystals that are orientated perpendicular to the shell 2 ̆ 7 s surface.

Passing vertically through the palisade layer of the shell from 2 ̆ 2 valleys 2 ̆ 2 between the marrmillary knobs {{to the surface of the}} vertical crystal layer are funnel - shaped, unbranched pores, These pores are capped by the cuticle which is cracked and thus allows the diffusion of gases between the contents of the egg and its environment.

40|$|ABSTRACT The outer {{portion of}} the <b>outer</b> <b>shell</b> <b>membrane</b> of hen eggs was removed, {{subjected}} to alkaline hydrolysis and analyzed for 7 -carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) via amino acid analysis. Although {{the presence of a}} ninhydrin positive substance was found in close proximity to the Gla reference peak, gas chromatographic-mass spectrophotometric analyses of this peak revealed that it was not Gla. 7 -Carboxyglutamic acid has been recently found in the shell matrix, and it was of interest to determine if the presence of Gla in the shell matrix is essential for the production of a strong shell. This was accomplished by feeding hens a vitamin K antagonist and evaluating their eggs for shell quality. Although prothrombin times were significantly increased, no significant changes occurred in the specific gravity measurements of eggs laid during the 14 days of treatment. This information strongly suggests that the carboxylation of glutamic acid is not an essential step in the formation of a strong eggshell...|$|E
40|$|The {{ultrastructure}} of the eggshell of {{the domestic}} hen has been well researched and structural studies of other avian species, such as the ostrich, often base their interpretation of egg shell structure on that of the chicken. In the ostrich, lowered hatchability and hatching trauma {{may be due to}} shell ultrastructural abnormalities. In the present study the ultrastructure of the calcified portion, and the <b>outer</b> <b>shell</b> <b>membrane</b> (OSM), of domesticated ostrich eggshells was investigated using standard electron microscopic techniques. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy studies demonstrated intimate contact between cup-shaped structures present on the OSMand the mammillary layer of the calcified portion of the shell. The initial calcium carbonate growth of the calcified shell was of a dendritic nature with nucleation sites {{on the surface of the}} cup's contents. The dendritic growth gave way to a more randomly-orientated, smaller crystallite growth structure, which changed in formas it neared the vertical crystal layer (VCL). The VCL is described as being both amorphous and 'crumbly' depending on the plane of fracture. These observations suggest that firstly, initial calcification is contained within the cups and is then directed outwards to formthe shell and that secondly, the VCL may contain an evolutionary, calcified cuticular layer. These observations serve as a baseline for studies investigating the effect of shell structure and strength on hatchling trauma and the influence of maternal diet...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT During {{the passage}} of the egg down the oviduct, the egg shell {{membrane}} has essentially three sizes of particles on the outer surface. Membranes from the mid-isthmus have small surface grains, visible only with staining, that range in size from one to ten microns. They occur at approximately 270 per mm. 2 increasing to approximately 2700 grains per mm. 2 in the posterior isthmus. These grains give a positive reaction for glyoxalbis-(o-hydroxyanil) and a negative reaction for carbonate. The grains are acid soluble and seem loosely attached since they seem to agglomerate during staining. They diminish in number when the egg has progressed into the tubular shell gland and are rarely found once the egg has reached the shell gland. Possibly the grains act as nuclei for the depositions of the secretions of the tubular shell gland.

40|$|During {{the course}} of evolution, the avian egg has {{developed}} multiple physical and chemical barriers in order to resist microbial challenges. These barriers are essential for the successful reproduction of avian species {{as well as to}} maintain safe and nutritious food for human consumption of the table egg. The calcified eggshell is a biomineralized barrier with an integrated organic matrix containing antimicrobial proteins, a hallmark of sophisticated biological structures. Calcium carbonate is deposited onto the <b>outer</b> <b>shell</b> <b>membranes</b> to form the calcified mammillary, palisade and vertical crystal layers; the final layer to be deposited is the outer eggshell cuticle. In this thesis, mass spectrometry-based technology was used to investigate the proteome of the outer cuticle, the mammillary cones and the <b>shell</b> <b>membranes</b> in order to gain insight into biomineralization and antimicrobial functions of the avian eggshell. Proteomics analysis of the eggshell cuticle revealed multiple antimicrobial proteins, supporting the hypothesis that the outermost cuticle layer is the first barrier against invading pathogens. The two most abundant cuticle proteins identified are similar to Kunitz-like protease inhibitor (ovocalyxin- 25) and ovocalyxin- 32. Multiple antimicrobial proteins were also revealed {{to be associated with the}} <b>shell</b> <b>membrane</b> fibres. Among the most abundant proteins were lysozyme C, avian β-defensin- 11, ovotransferrin, ovocalyxin- 36 and gallin. The biomineralized shell is also an important physical barrier against invading pathogens. Proteomics analysis of the mammillary cones, the initiation sites for shell calcification, revealed several candidate proteins involved in calcitic biomineralization. Promising candidates include nucleobindin- 2 and SPARC, two calcium binding proteins previously shown to modulate mineralization. In-depth analysis of the comprehensive proteomes generated by this study revealed the presence of histones in the <b>shell</b> <b>membranes,</b> <b>shell</b> and cuticle compartments. Histones are cationic antimicrobial peptides, which are key molecules of the innate immune defense system of many species. This thesis reports the minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal bactericidal concentrations of histones extracted from avian erythrocytes against Gram-positive, Gram-negative and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Results suggest that the underlying antimicrobial mechanism is based on the interaction between histones and lipopolysaccharides / lipoteichoic acids, which are negatively charged components of bacterial cell membranes. Histones also inhibit the growth of Gram-positive biofilms; the minimal biofilm eradication concentrations were determined for S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Sensitive proteomics analyses have provided great insight into the protein constituents of the eggshell matrix, with two primary roles in the innate immune defense of the egg: regulation of calcitic biomineralization and antimicrobial protection. Further research on these proteins and their functions can provide a new focus for selective breeding programs looking to enhance the egg’s natural defenses, or provide inspiration for alternatives to conventional antibiotics, such as the histones...|$|R
40|$|A {{relatively}} simple and economical process and apparatus for concentrating hydrogen peroxide from aqueous solution {{at the point}} of use have been invented. The heart of the apparatus is a vessel comprising an <b>outer</b> <b>shell</b> containing tubular <b>membranes</b> made of a polymer that is significantly more permeable by water than by hydrogen peroxide. The aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide to be concentrated is fed through the interstitial spaces between the tubular membranes. An initially dry sweep gas is pumped through the interiors of the tubular membranes. Water diffuses through the membranes and is carried away as water vapor mixed into the sweep gas. Because of the removal of water, the hydrogen peroxide solution flowing from the vessel at the outlet end is more concentrated than that fed into the vessel at the inlet end. The sweep gas can be air, nitrogen, or any other gas that can be conveniently supplied in dry form and does not react chemically with hydrogen peroxide...|$|R

Through incremental deletions, we have reduced the length of a virus membrane protein transmembrane domain from its normal 26 amino acids to 8 amino acids. We examined the effect of these deletions on the assembly and function of virus particles. We found that progressive truncations in the transmembrane domain profoundly affected production of infectious virus in a cyclic fashion.
