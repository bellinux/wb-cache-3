25|$|Kritiks: The {{negative}} {{can claim}} that the affirmative is guilty of a certain mindset or assumption that should be grounds for rejection or a different mutually exclusive alternative to the Affirmatives plan. Kritiks are sometimes a reason to reject the entire affirmative advocacy without evaluating its policy; other times, kritiks can be evaluated within the same framework for evaluation as the affirmative case. Examples of some areas of literature for kritiks include biopower, racism, centralized government, and anthropocentrism. Kritiks arose in the early 1990s, with the first kritiks based in deconstructionist philosophy about the intrinsic ambiguity of language and were championed by debaters Shane Stafford and Bill Shanahan. Kritiks today have evolved to sometimes include the affirmative advocacy within their alternatives. These kritiks argue that the <b>ontological</b> <b>or</b> epistemological assumptions behind the affirmative are flawed {{and ought to be}} rejected, but the plan itself is fine. For example, an affirmative could argue that {{it would be good to}} reduce our nuclear stockpile to avoid global proliferation out of fear of rogue states acquiring nuclear weapons. The negative could respond with an aff-inclusive kritik that argues that it would be good to reduce our nuclear stockpile because nuclear weapons are unethical, but that we ought not conceptualize other states as fundamentally dangerous.|$|E
60|$|There {{have been}} men in all ages, {{who have been}} impelled as by an {{instinct}} to propose their own nature as a problem, and who devote their attempts to its solution. The {{first step was to}} construct a table of distinctions, which they seem to have formed on the principle of the absence or presence of the Will. Our various sensations, perceptions, and movements were classed as active or passive, or as media partaking of both. A still finer distinction was soon established between the voluntary and the spontaneous. In our perceptions we seem to ourselves merely passive to an external power, whether as a mirror reflecting the landscape, or as a blank canvass on which some unknown hand paints it. For it is worthy of notice, that the latter, or the system of Idealism may be traced to sources equally remote with the former, or Materialism; and Berkeley can boast an ancestry at least as venerable as Gassendi or Hobbes. These conjectures, however, concerning the mode in which our perceptions originated, could not alter the natural difference of Things and Thoughts. In the former, the cause appeared wholly external, while in the latter, sometimes our will interfered as the producing or determining cause, and sometimes our nature seemed to act by a mechanism of its own, without any conscious effort of the will, or even against it. Our inward experiences were thus arranged in three separate classes, the passive sense, or what the School-men call the merely receptive quality of the mind; the voluntary; and the spontaneous, which holds the middle place between both. But it is not in human nature to meditate on any mode of action, without inquiring after the law that governs it; and in the explanation of the spontaneous movements of our being, the metaphysician took the lead of the anatomist and natural philosopher. In Egypt, Palestine, Greece, and India the analysis of the mind had reached its noon and manhood, while experimental research was still in its dawn and infancy. For many, very many centuries, it has been difficult to advance a new truth, or even a new error, in the philosophy of the intellect or morals. With regard, however, to the laws that direct the spontaneous movements of thought and the principle of their intellectual mechanism there exists, it has been asserted, an important exception most honourable to the moderns, and in the merit of which our own country claims the largest share. Sir James Mackintosh,--(who, amid the variety of his talents and attainments, is not of less repute for the depth and accuracy of his philosophical inquiries than for the eloquence with which he is said to render their most difficult results perspicuous, and the driest attractive,)--affirmed in the Lectures, delivered by him in Lincoln's Inn Hall, that the law of association as established in the contemporaneity of the original impressions, formed the basis of all true psychology; and that any <b>ontological</b> <b>or</b> metaphysical science, not contained in such (that is, an empirical) psychology, was but a web of abstractions and generalizations. Of this prolific truth, of this great fundamental law, he declared Hobbes to have been the original discoverer, while its full application to the whole intellectual system we owed to Hartley; who stood in the same relation to Hobbes as Newton to Kepler; the law of association being that to the mind, which gravitation is to matter.|$|E

The connection with ancestors is a central feature of the Constellation process.|$|E
5000|$|While Eastern Orthodox sources often {{refer to}} the bishops as [...] "successors of the apostles" [...] under the {{influence}} of Scholastic theology, strict Orthodox ecclesiology and theology hold that all legitimate bishops are properly successors of Peter. This also means that presbyters (or [...] "priests") are successors of the apostles. As a result, Orthodox theology makes a distinction between a geographical or historical succession and proper <b>ontological</b> <b>or</b> ecclesiological succession. Hence, the bishops of Rome and Antioch can be considered successors of Peter in a historical sense on account of Peter's presence in the early community. This does not imply that these bishops are more successors of Peter than all others in an ontological sense.|$|E

According to Kompridis, these arguments have distinctive forms, sometimes called styles of reasoning, that start with a disclosive approach instead of, or in addition to methods that are deductive, inductive, etc. According to disclosure theorists, these forms of argument attempt to reveal features of a wider <b>ontological</b> <b>or</b> cultural-linguistic understanding (or [...] "world," [...] in a specifically ontological sense), in order to clarify or transform the background of meaning and [...] "logical space" [...] on which an argument implicitly depends.

50|$|The {{philosophy}} of perception {{is concerned with}} the nature of perceptual experience and the status of perceptual data, in particular how they relate to beliefs about, or knowledge of, the world. Any explicit account of perception requires a commitment to one of a variety of <b>ontological</b> <b>or</b> metaphysical views. Philosophers distinguish internalist accounts, which assume that perceptions of objects, and knowledge or beliefs about them, are aspects of an individual's mind, and externalist accounts, which state that they constitute real aspects of the world external to the individual. The position of naïve realism—the 'everyday' impression of physical objects constituting what is perceived—is to some extent contradicted by the occurrence of perceptual illusions and hallucinations and the relativity of perceptual experience as well as certain insights in science. Realist conceptions include phenomenalism and direct and indirect realism. Anti-realist conceptions include idealism and skepticism.|$|E

5000|$|As {{conventionally}} {{conceived by}} philosophers of science, scientific explanation of a phenomenon was simply epistemic (concerning knowledge), and {{centered on the}} phenomenon's counterfactual derivability from initial conditions plus natural laws (Hempel's covering law model). [...] Yet Salmon found causality ubiquitous in scientific explanation, which identifies not only natural laws (empirical regularities), but accounts for them via nature's structure and thereby involves the ontic (concerning reality), how the phenomenon [...] "fits into the causal nexus" [...] of the world (Salmon's causal/mechanical explanation). [...] For instance, Boyle's law relates temperature, pressure, and volume of an ideal gas (epistemic), but this was later reduced to laws of statistical mechanics via average kinetic energy of colliding molecules composing the gas (ontic). [...] Thus, Salmon finds scientific explanation to be not merely nomological—that is, lawlike—but rather <b>ontological,</b> <b>or</b> causal/mechanical. [...] Though asserting the primacy of causal/mechanical explanation, Salmon was vague as to how scientists can attain it.
