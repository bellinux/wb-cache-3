In Campbell County, two homes were destroyed and ten others suffered minor damage. One residence in Amherst County suffered minor damage, and in Appomattox County <b>one</b> <b>home</b> reported major damage.

5|$|Despite {{the initial}} threat of strong {{thunderstorms}} and gusts, Florida was spared {{a direct hit}} from Nicole. The storm skirted the state with only showers; 12.71inches (323mm) of rain were recorded at North Key Largo, though the mainland received much smaller quantities. The storm flooded streets in Miami Beach and the northern Florida Keys, as well as <b>one</b> <b>home.</b> Similarly, inclement weather spread over the northwestern Bahamas without significant consequences.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the threat}} of landslides, 5,500 {{households}} were evacuated across the Amami Islands on August27. <b>One</b> <b>home</b> was destroyed and 1,065 residences were evacuated in Tokunoshima. Eight people were injured across the island and 549 sought refuge in public shelters. In Yonabaru, the typhoon's storm surge and large swells flooded coastal highways and inundated nearby buildings. Large sections of roads were also washed away by the storm. Cellphone service was lost late on August26 throughout much of Okinawa Prefecture.|$|E
50|$|In {{a number}} of {{countries}} where military brat subcultures occur (but with some exceptions and to varying degrees), there may also be an itinerant or modern nomadic lifestyle involved as the child follows their military-parent(s) from military base to military base, in many cases never having a hometown (or at least going through very long periods of being away from <b>one's</b> <b>home</b> town). It also can involve living outside of <b>one's</b> <b>home</b> country at or near overseas military bases in foreign cultures, or in regions within <b>one's</b> <b>home</b> country far from <b>one's</b> <b>home</b> region, along with experiences of significant cultural difference in either case. Highly mobile Military brat subcultures have also been described as modern nomadic or peripatetic subcultures.|$|R

5|$|In 1996, Bonds {{became the}} first National League player and second (of the current list of four) major league player(s) to hit 40 home runs and steal 40 bases in the same season. The {{other members of the}} 40–40 club are José Canseco–1988, Alex Rodriguez–1998, and Alfonso Soriano–2006; his father Bobby Bonds was <b>one</b> <b>home</b> run short in 1973 when he hit 39 home runs and stole 43 bases.|$|E
5|$|The {{claim that}} the {{accordion}} feat was performed by Home using a small harmonica was originally suggested by J. M. Robertson in 1891. The psychical researcher Eric Dingwall who catalogued Home's collection on its arrival at the SPR did not record {{the presence of the}} mouth organs, and Lamont speculates that it is unlikely Dingwall would have missed these or not made them public. The accordion in the SPR collection is not the actual <b>one</b> <b>Home</b> used. They display a duplicate.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea {{have only}} had <b>one</b> <b>home</b> ground, Stamford Bridge, {{where they have}} played since the team's foundation. It was officially opened on 28 April 1877 {{and for the first}} 28 years of its {{existence}} it was used almost exclusively by the London Athletic Club as an arena for athletics meetings and not at all for football. In 1904 the ground was acquired by businessman Gus Mears and his brother Joseph, who had also purchased nearby land (formerly a large market garden) with the aim of staging football matches on the now 12.5acre (51,000m²) site. Stamford Bridge was designed for the Mears family by the noted football architect Archibald Leitch, who had also designed Ibrox, Craven Cottage and Hampden Park. Most football clubs were founded first, and then sought grounds in which to play, but Chelsea were founded for Stamford Bridge.|$|E

5|$|Damage was {{confined}} to Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, and south-central Iowa, and largely consisted of fallen chimneys, foundation cracks, collapsed parapets, and overturned tombstones. In <b>one</b> <b>home</b> in Dale, Illinois, near Tuckers Corners and southwest of McLeansboro, the quake cracked interior walls, plaster, and chimneys. Using a type of victim study, the local post office surveyed residents and implemented a field inspection which indicated the strongest shaking (MM VII) {{took place in the}} Wabash Valley, Ohio Valley, and other nearby south-central Illinois lowlands. Outside this four-state zone, oscillating objects including cars, chimneys, and the Gateway Arch were reported to authorities.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eighth}} inning, Myles Thomas {{came in to}} relieve Shocker, who had given up three hits and two unearned runs {{in less than an}} inning of work. Meanwhile, Alexander shut down the Yankees offense {{for the rest of the}} game. In the top of the ninth inning, the Cardinals {{increased}} their lead back to eight runs after Hornsby had an RBI groundout, scoring Southworth. Alexander finished with his second complete game of the series and gave up only two runs on eight hits, while striking out six batters. The three Yankee pitchers combined to give up thirteen hits, seven earned runs, three unearned runs, and <b>one</b> <b>home</b> run.|$|E
5|$|Kemp {{was placed}} on the {{disabled}} list on May 14 because of a hamstring injury, ending his streak of 399 consecutive games played, which was the longest in the majors at the time. After his DL stint, he promptly re-injured his hamstring two days later while running the bases, and returned to the DL. Despite missing about 2 months with injuries, Kemp was voted by the fans as a starter for the 2012 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. As he was still on the disabled list, Kemp did not play in the game but he did participate in the Home Run Derby for the second straight year, hitting <b>one</b> <b>home</b> run in the Derby. Kemp finally returned to the Dodgers lineup on July 13, after missing about two months with his hamstring injury.|$|E

5|$|Kenwood {{was built}} in 1913, and was {{originally}} called The Brown House. On Wood Lane, off Cavendish Road, and built in a mock-Tudor style, the footprint and gardens cover , of which the house must occupy {{no more than one}} fifth and the plot may not be subdivided into more than <b>one</b> <b>home</b> under the rules of the building scheme. It was designed in 1913 by architect Theophilus Arthur Allen, who had been commissioned by local man Norman H. Johnson. Allen employed a local firm called Love & Sons in the construction of Kenwood. The hill was divided into lots around the Weybridge Golf Club, which was designed by Harry Colt in 1912. Many of the original houses on the estate were built by master builder Walter George Tarrant whose firm constructed the original external garage ca.1920 (demolished ca.1995).|$|E
5|$|McLeansboro in {{particular}} experienced minor damage over an extensive area. Its {{local high school}} reported 19broken windows in the girls' gymnasium, along with cracked plaster walls. Most of the high school's classrooms sustained fractured walls. The facade of the town's First United Methodist Church was damaged, and a brick and concrete block fell off the top. Hamilton County Courthouse withstood several structural cracks, including one on the ceiling above the judge's seat. The town's residents also reported collapsing chimneys; three chimneys toppled at <b>one</b> <b>home,</b> leading to further damage.|$|E
5|$|Moderate wind {{gusts of}} up 46mph (74km/h) were {{reported}} in Tobago, which downed several trees and caused power outages in seven villages; power was cut to more than 30% of the island. Twenty villages on the island suffered various forms of damage, and at least 45homes lost their roofs. The hurricane left 22people homeless and directly impacted about 1,000people. The hurricane caused one death when a falling tree killed a woman. Wave heights were estimated at 65feet (20m), and at least <b>one</b> <b>home</b> collapsed and fell into the ocean. Rainfall from the storm's passage unofficially peaked at 16.2inches (411mm) on the island, which caused some mudslides. Some crop damage was also reported, and overall damage on Tobago was estimated at $4.9million (2004USD, ($ USD)); damage in neighboring Trinidad was minimal.|$|E

As such, states with justifiable homicide provisions in pertaining to one's domicile, do not in themselves authorize indiscriminate violence therein—the mere fact that one is trespassing is no defense per se to justifying homicide.|$|R
5|$|On February 15, {{the team}} had a record of 27–25–5 and was five points out of playoff position. The {{organization}} fired head coach Michel Therrien and replaced him with Dan Bylsma, {{head coach of the}} organization's American Hockey League affiliate in Wilkes-Barre. On February 26, the team traded defenseman Ryan Whitney to the Anaheim Ducks in return for Chris Kunitz. Before the trade deadline on March 4, they acquired Bill Guerin from the New York Islanders. Under Bylsma, the team went 18–3–4, including 10–1–2 in March, and lost only <b>one</b> <b>home</b> game.|$|E
5|$|On June 10, a {{powerful}} squall line of thunderstorms with embedded supercells developed across New York and moved northeast through parts of northern New England and Quebec. Particularly hard hit was the Montreal region and its southern suburbs including Longueuil, Châteauguay, Brossard and Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu. Barns were reported damaged and other structures sustained roof and siding damage; {{particularly in the}} Saint-Blaise-sur-Richelieu area where <b>one</b> <b>home</b> was pushed from its foundation. In Sainte-Catherine, the roof of an office was blown into a nearby residence punching a large hole on the back wall. On Montreal's Champlain Bridge, eight tractor trailers were overturned forcing {{the closure of the}} entire bridge in both directions. In addition, a window washing platform tumbled from a high rise building in downtown Montreal. The workers were able to get inside.|$|E
5|$|Rainfall up to 5in (127mm) in Massachusetts {{caused a}} river in Somerset to {{overflow}} its banks, flooding nearby areas with 2feet (0.6m) of water. A large sinkhole formed on County Street and several cars were {{stranded in the}} floodwaters. Two people had to be rescued by boat when their car was overcome by the floodwaters. In addition, numerous basements were flooded. Damages in Bristol County were estimated at $25,000. A mobile home park in Plymouth County was inundated with 2.5ft (0.7m) of water, causing <b>one</b> <b>home</b> to shift off its foundation. Damages to the homes were estimated at $50,000.|$|E
50|$|In {{combination}} with the Industrial Revolution and as media transitioned from the public space to more comfortable roles inside <b>one's</b> <b>home,</b> {{there was a large}} shift away from public activities because they could be enjoyed within the confines of <b>one’s</b> <b>home.</b> With the advent of online technologies these virtual third places have been observed in online communities. The characteristics observed in these communities vary from their physical application but meet the context of personalization, permeability, approachability, and comfortability.|$|R
50|$|Home improvement, home renovation, or remodelling is {{the process}} of renovating or making {{additions}} to <b>one's</b> <b>home.</b> Home improvement can be projects that upgrade an existing home interior (such as electrical and plumbing), exterior (masonry, concrete, siding, roofing), or other improvements to the property (i.e. garden work or garage maintenance/additions).|$|R

5|$|Since {{moving to}} the City of Manchester Stadium, Manchester City's average attendances {{have been in the}} top six in England, usually in excess of 40,000. Even in the late 1990s, when the club were relegated twice in three seasons and playing in the third tier of English {{football}} (then Division Two, now Football League <b>One),</b> <b>home</b> attendances were in the region of 30,000, compared to an average for the division of fewer than 8,000. Research carried out by Manchester City in 2005 estimates a fanbase of 886,000 in the United Kingdom and a total in excess of 2 million worldwide, although since the purchase of the club by Sheikh Mansour and the club's recent trophies, that figure has ballooned to many times that size.|$|E
5|$|The {{community}} of Big Woods was significantly affected by flooding, with 30 families being {{isolated in the}} area. The only fatality from the storm also occurred in this community after a man was washed away while trying to rescue a family. The severity of damage in Big Woods prompted Jamaica Labour Party Area Council Four chairman to state {{that it should be}} declared a disaster area. Torrential rains during a two-hour span overnight triggered most of the flooding in the area, isolating many homes and inundating several. In Westmoreland Parish, severe flooding inundated several homes and damaged roadways. <b>One</b> <b>home</b> sustained significant damage after a large tree fell on it. In Kingston, high winds damaged power lines and some homes. Water supply to most regions was cut due to damage to pipelines and high water turbidity. Widespread power outages occurred due to numerous downed trees and power lines.|$|E
5|$|The {{second season}} of the EIHL saw a series of games between the EIHL clubs {{and the members of}} the BNL.

Results in these crossover games would count towards a team's points tally. The NHL lock-out also saw a number of NHL players join British clubs. Coventry won a Grand Slam of all three titles, winning the Championship with an overtime victory over the Nottingham Panthers.|$|E
