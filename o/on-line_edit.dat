The key insight {{is that many of}} these applications are designed to perform most of their data-dependent computation on the client side, so it is possible to maintain their functionality while only exposing an encrypted version of the document to the server. We apply our methodology to Google Documents and describe a prototype extension tool that enables users to use a cloud application to manage their documents without sacrificing confidentiality or integrity. To provide adequate performance, we employ an incremental encryption scheme and extend it to support variable-length blocks. We analyze the security of our scheme and report on experiments that show our extension preserves most of the cloud application’s functionality with less than 10 % overhead for typical use.

It combines the advantages of internet with printing processes in a highly digitalized way, and has been used in the U. S. and Europe for a while. Nowadays in the 21 st century, whether offset printing, gravure printing, flexo printing, screen printing or digital printing cannot survive without internet, and it will be the trend for printers to develop Web-to-Print platform to reduce cost and increase productivity. Most of Asian printers still use traditional processes to print orders. Comparing to the printers in the U. S. or European countries, these printers in Asia seem not so active in the development of Web-to-Print. Under the influence of digitalization, it will be very important for them to consider how to provide “Web-to-Print ” services. To begin with, this research conduct case study analyses of major successful stories of Web-to-Print by literature and actual examples. Functionalities of profitable web-to-print platform, based on our findings, may include various basic on-line operations such as <b>on-line</b> <b>editing,</b> <b>on-line</b> proofing and on-line ordering.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a generalized framework for dynamic simulation realized in a prototype simulator called the Interactive Generalized Motion Simulator (I-GMS), which can simulate motions of multirigid-body systems with contact interaction in virtual environments. I-GMS {{is designed to}} meet two important goals: generality and interactivity. By generality, we mean a dynamic simulator which can easily support various systems of rigid bodies, ranging from a single free-flying rigid object to complex linkages such as those needed for robotic systems or human body simulation. To provide this generality, we have developed I-GMS in an object-oriented framework. The user interactivity is supported through a haptic interface for articulated bodies, introducing interactive dynamic simulation schemes. This user-interaction is achieved by performing push and pull operations via the PHANToM haptic device, which runs as an integrated part of I-GMS. Also, a hybrid scheme was used for simulating internal contacts (between bodies in the multirigid-body system) {{in the presence of}} friction, which could avoid the nonexistent solution problem often faced when solving contact problems with Coulomb friction. In our hybrid scheme, two impulse-based methods are exploited so that different methods are applied adaptively, depending on whether the current contact situation is characterized as “bouncing ” or “steady. ” We demonstrate the user-interaction capability of I-GMS through <b>on-line</b> <b>editing</b> of trajectories of a 6 -degree of freedom (dof) articulated structure.
