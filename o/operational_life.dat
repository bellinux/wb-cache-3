5|$|The Shuttle is {{the first}} orbital {{spacecraft}} designed for partial reusability. It carries large payloads to various orbits, and, during the Shuttle–Mir and ISS programs, provides crew rotation and carries various supplies, modules and pieces of equipment to the stations.

5|$|Contamination {{primarily}} {{resulted from}} two major plutonium fires in 1957 and 1969 (plutonium is pyrophoric and shavings can spontaneously combust) and from wind-blown plutonium that leaked from barrels of radioactive waste. Much lower concentrations of radioactive isotopes were released throughout the <b>operational</b> <b>life</b> {{of the plant}} from 1952 to 1992, from smaller accidents and from normal operational releases of plutonium particles {{too small to be}} filtered. Prevailing winds from the plant swept airborne contamination south and east, into populated areas northwest of Denver.|$|E
5|$|Duxford {{has been}} {{associated}} with British military aviation since 1917, when a site near the village of Duxford, in southern Cambridgeshire, was selected for a new Royal Flying Corps training aerodrome. From 1925 Duxford became a fighter airfield, a role it was to retain until the end of its <b>operational</b> <b>life,</b> and in August 1938 the Duxford-based No.19 Squadron RAF became the first to operate the Supermarine Spitfire.|$|E

40|$|Concrete keeps {{being the}} leading {{structural}} material {{due to its}} low production cost and its great structural design flexibility. However, concrete is prone to various ambient and operational loads which are responsible for crack initiation and extension, leading to decrease of its anticipated <b>operational</b> service <b>life.</b> The current study is focusing {{on the use of}} ultrasonic wave propagation techniques based on low-cost and aggregate-size embedded piezoelectric transducers for the online monitoring of the damage state and the healing performance in concrete structures with an autonomous healing system in the form of encapsulated polyurethane-based healing agent embedded in the matrix of concrete. The crack formation triggers the autonomous healing mechanism which promises material recovery and extension of the <b>operational</b> service <b>life.</b> The proposed technique is applied on large-scale, steel reinforced, concrete beams (150 mm × 250 mm × 3000 mm), subjected to four-point bending. After the capsules are broken and the healing agent is released, which results in filling of the crack void, and polymerized, the concrete beams are reloaded. The results demonstrate the ability of the monitoring system to detect the initiation and propagation of the cracking as well as to assess the performance of the self-healing system...|$|R

5|$|Portland Bill is the {{southern}} tip of the island of Portland. The Bill has three lighthouse towers: The Higher Lighthouse is now a dwelling and holiday apartments; the Lower Lighthouse is now a bird observatory and field centre providing records of bird migration and accommodation for visitors, which opened in 1961. The white and red lighthouse on Bill Point replaced the Higher and Lower Lighthouses in 1906. It is a prominent and much photographed feature; an important landmark for ships passing the headland and its tidal race. The current lighthouse was refurbished in 1996 and became remotely controlled. It now contains a visitors' centre giving information and guided tours of the lighthouse. As of June 2009, the lighthouse uses a 1kW metal-halide US-made lamp with an <b>operational</b> <b>life</b> of about 4000 hours, or 14 months.|$|E
5|$|The {{submarines}} {{originally had}} a predicted <b>operational</b> <b>life</b> of around 30 years, with Collins to decommission around 2025. The Submarine Institute of Australia {{released a report}} in July 2007 arguing that planning {{for the next generation}} of Australian submarines had to begin soon. In December 2007, shortly after the 2007 federal election, the Australian government announced that planning for a Collins-class replacement (procurement project SEA 1000) had commenced. The 2009 Defending Australia in the Asia Pacific Century: Force 2030 white paper confirmed the replacement project, and announced that the submarine fleet would be increased to twelve vessels to sustain submarine operations in any conflict, and counter the growing potency of Asian-Pacific naval forces.|$|E
5|$|Prison life at Fremantle was {{extremely}} regulated. Meals were {{an important part}} of the day, eaten in the cells throughout the <b>operational</b> <b>life</b> of the prison. Convict or prisoner labour was used on public infrastructure works until around 1911; subsequently, only work inside the prison was allowed, though there was never enough to fully occupy the inmates. Punishments varied over the years, with flogging and time in irons eventually replaced by lengthening of sentences and deprivation of visitors or entertainment. More than 40 hangings were carried out at Fremantle Prison, which was Western Australia's only lawful place of execution, between 1888 and 1984. Prominent escapees included Moondyne Joe, as well as John Boyle O'Reilly and six other Fenians in the 19th century, and Brenden Abbott in 1989. There have been various riots and other disturbances, with major riots causing damage in 1968 and 1988.|$|E

50|$|The C-160 {{proved to}} be a {{versatile}} aircraft, leading to a long <b>operational</b> service <b>life.</b> Between its introduction and 1999, approximately 2000 modifications and upgrades were incorporated upon the type, split 60/40 between the structure and equipment respectively. Many changes were made over time in regards to the aircraft's avionics: particular attention was paid in Luftwaffe refurbishments to the navigation and flight control systems, onboard data management computers and radar system, incorporating new features such as GPS and laser inertial navigation systems, modern autopilot and crew management systems, and a greater degree of cockpit integration.|$|R
5|$|In 1915, the Corporation {{had made}} {{enquiries}} about purchasing a second-hand steam engine, approaching six locomotive manufacturers, but eventually acquired a new 0-4-0 saddle tank from Peckett and Sons Ltd, {{which was built}} at their Bristol works in 1918. The original engine became a spare, but was hired out to the Blackburn Meadows power station in March 1936. A year later it was condemned by the insurance company, and was sold for scrap to Maden and McKee Ltd, who were based in Liverpool. A replacement was sought, and a third 0-4-0 saddle tank, made by Hudswell Clarke in 1914, was bought from the Olympia Oil and Cake Company at Selby. It was coupled into a goods train, and arrived at the works in July 1937. At the works, as at Selby, it carried the name Olympia, painted on the tanks. The Peckett was overhauled by the Yorkshire Engine Company at Meadow Hall Works between 1945 and 1946. Because there was a statutory obligation to keep the treatment works operational, a special dispensation was obtained during the 1926 general strike, to allow this engine to run over the main line, delivering wagons to Kilnhurst tip. Kilnhurst tip eventually became full, and in January 1948, regular tipping operations ceased, after a new tip at Thrybergh opened. Tipping continued at Kilnhurst sporadically, until it was closed in 1959. During its <b>operational</b> <b>life</b> up to 1948, 2,917,480 tons of sewage sludge was dumped at the site, and following closure, it was sold to the National Coal Board in 1961.|$|E
