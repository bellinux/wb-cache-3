5|$|Repairs and {{alterations}} {{were made}} to the lighthouse in 1863-64 by engineer Henry Norris, when the single-wick lamp was replaced with a Chance Brothers four-wick burner, as well as a new lens. The improvements included a red arc of light over the hazardous Pearl Rock region. An additional upgrade was made in 1875 when the lamp was switched out for a four-wick mineral <b>oil</b> <b>burner.</b>|$|E
25|$|An <b>oil</b> <b>burner</b> is {{a heating}} device which burns fuel oil. The oil is {{directed}} under pressure through a nozzle {{to produce a}} fine spray, which is usually ignited by an electric spark with the air being forced through by an electric fan. In 1880, Amanda Jones invented the <b>oil</b> <b>burner</b> in the oil fields of northern Pennsylvania where Jones completed her trial and error efforts of heating furnaces.|$|E
25|$|Holden's first <b>oil</b> <b>burner</b> of 1893, Petrolea, was a 2-4-0 {{and burned}} waste oil that the Railway had {{previously}} been discharging into the River Lea. It was largely inspired by Thomas Urquhart's success in Russia, and was eventually followed {{by more than a}} hundred additional oil-burners.|$|E

25|$|An {{efficiently}} insulated tank can retain {{stored heat}} for days, reducing fuel costs. Hot water tanks {{may have a}} built-in gas or <b>oil</b> <b>burner</b> system, electric immersion heaters. Some types use an external heat exchanger such as a central heating system, or heated water from another energy source. The most typical, in the domestic context, is a fossil-fuel burner, electric immersion elements, or a district heating scheme.|$|E
25|$|For {{most of the}} time, the railway's steam {{locomotives}} have burnt coal. The {{requirement for}} the locomotives to have a hot fire burning efficiently for a solid hour has led to problems when best Welsh steam coal has not been readily available. During 1978 Nos.2 and 8 ran with oil burners. To hold the fuel oil, a tank was fitted {{to the roof of}} each locomotive. The tanks were thin and followed the profile of the roof. In 2000, No.2 was again fitted with an <b>oil</b> <b>burner</b> in an attempt avoid the increasing problems of obtaining suitable coal.|$|E
25|$|The burners for {{the lights}} were changed from colza oil to {{paraffin}} oil in 1876. The original system was in use for 60 years, and in 1925, the optical apparatus was upgraded to a second order dioptric lens with an incandescent <b>oil</b> <b>burner.</b> This changed the light output to three flashes in quick succession every 30 seconds. A diesel electric plant was installed in 1954, and electrical operation of the beam started in October of that year. The diesel generator was replaced in 1970. In September 1999, the light was replaced again, {{this time with a}} rotating beacon, with a 35-watt halogen bulb as the light source. The energy comes from solar panels and a battery bank.|$|E

25|$|The vaporized <b>oil</b> <b>burner</b> {{was invented}} in 1901 by Arthur Kitson, and {{improved}} by David Hood at Trinity House. The fuel was vaporized at high pressure and burned to heat the mantle, giving an output of over six times the luminosity of traditional oil lights. The use of gas as illuminant became widely available with {{the invention of the}} Dalén light by Swedish engineer, Gustaf Dalén. He used Agamassan (Aga), a substrate, to absorb the gas allowing safe storage and hence commercial exploitation. Dalén also invented the 'sun valve', which automatically regulated the light and turned it off during the daytime. The technology was the predominant form of light source in lighthouses from the 1900s through the 1960s, when electric lighting had become dominant.|$|E
25|$|The furnace {{was placed}} in the space between the tube banks. Early boilers were {{manually}} coal fired, later oil fired. The boiler was enclosed in a sealed casing of steel, lined with firebricks. Brick-lined end walls to this casing housed the firedoors or <b>oil</b> <b>burner</b> quarls, but had no heating surface. The uptake flue from the boiler was in the centre top of the casing, the exhaust gases passing around the steam drum. To reduce corrosion from flue gases over the drum, it was sometimes wrapped in a simple deflector shroud. Usually {{the lower part of the}} water drums were exposed outside the casing, but only the ends of the steam drum emerged. The water level was at around one-third of the steam drum diameter, enough to cover the ends of the submerged water-tubes.|$|E

2500|$|In 2007 Eureka Models {{announced}} an intent {{to produce a}} plastic, ready-to-run version of the locomotive. After years of development and many changes in planned manufacturers, the class was finally delivered from early 2013.

Additionally, 761 is missing [...] "STEAMRAIL" [...] plates for the front and rear, and 707 is missing [...] "CITY OF MELBOURNE" [...] plates for the sides and chrome detailing. The latter plates could be obtained from Eureka Models as spare parts. The run had been planned to include West Coast Railway models R711 and R766, but these were not released with the first run due to needing a completely different tender shell, and are instead planned for a future release.|$|E
