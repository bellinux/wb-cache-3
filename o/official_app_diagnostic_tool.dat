40|$|Abstract Background Intellectual {{disability}} (ID) is {{a devastating}} and frequent condition, affecting 2 - 3 % {{of the population}} worldwide. Early recognition of treatable underlying conditions drastically improves health outcomes and decreases burdens to patients, families and society. Our systematic literature review identified 81 such inborn errors of metabolism, which present with ID as a prominent feature and are amenable to causal therapy. The WebAPP translates this knowledge of rare diseases into a <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tool</b> and information portal. Methods & results Freely available as a WebAPP via [URL] and end 2012 via the <b>APP</b> store, this <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tool</b> is designed for all specialists evaluating children with global delay / ID and laboratory scientists. Information on the 81 diseases is presented in different ways with search functions: 15 biochemical categories, neurologic and non-neurologic signs & symptoms, diagnostic investigations (metabolic screening tests in blood and urine identify 65 % of all IEM), therapies & effects on primary (IQ/developmental quotient) and secondary outcomes, and available evidence For each rare condition a ‘disease page’ serves as an information portal with online access to specific genetics, biochemistry, phenotype, diagnostic tests and therapeutic options. As new knowledge and evidence is gained from expert input and PubMed searches this tool will be continually updated. The WebAPP {{is an integral part}} of a protocol prioritizing treatability in the work-up of every child with global delay / ID. A 3 -year funded study will enable an evaluation of its effectiveness. Conclusions For rare diseases, a field for which financial and scientific resources are particularly scarce, knowledge translation challenges are abundant. With this WebAPP technology is capitalized to raise awareness for rare treatable diseases and their common presenting clinical feature of ID, with the potential to improve health outcomes. This innovative digital tool is designed to motivate health care providers to search actively for treatable causes of ID, and support an evidence-based approach to rare metabolic diseases. In our current –omics world with continuous information flow, the effective synthesis of data into accessible, clinical knowledge has become ever more essential to bridge the gap between research and care. </p...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{climate and}} weather models have {{advanced}} to finer scales, accompanied by {{large amounts of}} output data. The model systems hit the input and output (I/O) bottleneck of modern high-performance computing (HPC) systems. We aim to apply diagnostic methods online during the model simulation instead of applying them as a post-processing step to written output data, {{to reduce the amount}} of I/O. To include <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tools</b> into the model system, we implemented a standardised, easy-to-use interface based on the Modular Earth Submodel System (MESSy) into the ICOsahedral Non-hydrostatic (ICON) modelling framework. The integration of the diagnostic interface into the model system is briefly described. Furthermore, we present a prototype implementation of an advanced online <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tool</b> for the aggregation of model data onto a user-defined regular coarse grid. This <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tool</b> will be used {{to reduce the amount of}} model output in future simulations. Performance tests of the interface and of two different <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tools</b> show, that the interface itself introduces no overhead in form of additional runtime to the model system. The <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tools,</b> however, have significant impact on the model system's runtime. This overhead strongly depends on the characteristics and implementation of the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tool.</b> A <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tool</b> with high inter-process communication introduces large overhead, whereas the additional runtime of a <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tool</b> without inter-process communication is low. We briefly describe our efforts to reduce the additional runtime from the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tools,</b> and present a brief analysis of memory consumption. Future work will focus on optimisation of the memory footprint and the I/O operations of the diagnostic interface...|$|R

40|$|Particular <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tools</b> may {{isolate the}} {{signature}} {{left on the}} oscillation frequencies {{by the presence of}} a small convective core. Their frequency derivative is expected to provide information about convective core's properties and stellar age. The main goal of this work is to study the potential of the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tools</b> with regards to the inference of stellar age and stellar core's properties. For that, we computed <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tools</b> and their frequency derivatives from the oscillation frequencies of main-sequence models with masses between 1. 0 and 1. 6 M_ and with different physics. We considered the dependence of the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tools</b> on stellar age and {{on the size of the}} relative discontinuity in the squared sound speed at the edge of the convectively unstable region. We find that the absolute value of the frequency derivatives of the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tools</b> increases as the star evolves on the main sequence. The fraction of stellar main-sequence evolution for models with masses > 1. 2 M_ may be estimated from the frequency derivatives of two of the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tools.</b> For lower mass models, constraints on the convective core's overshoot can potentially be derived based on the analysis of the same derivatives. For at least 35 per cent of our sample of stellar models the frequency derivative of the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tools</b> takes its maximum absolute value on the frequency range where observed oscillations may be expected.
