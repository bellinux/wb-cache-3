5|$|Brown {{supports}} expanding solar, wind, {{and nuclear}} power, and <b>offshore</b> <b>drilling</b> exploration {{as a means}} to reduce the country's dependence on foreign oil. But, when faced with the controversial issue of whether an offshore wind farm should be allowed in the waters off the Cape Cod coast in Massachusetts, a major tourist destination and boating location, he expressed opposition, saying he believed it would hinder tourism and boating in the area.|$|E
5|$|Hydrocarbon {{exploration}} {{in deep water}} occasionally results in significant environmental degradation resulting mainly from accumulation of contaminated drill cuttings, but also from oil spills. While the oil gusher involved in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico originates from a wellhead only 1500meters below the ocean surface, it nevertheless illustrates the kind of environmental disaster that can result from mishaps related to <b>offshore</b> <b>drilling</b> for oil and gas.|$|E
5|$|Over the city's history {{many large}} oil {{companies}} have been headquartered in the city, including Warren Petroleum (which merged with Gulf Oil {{in what was then}} the largest merger in the energy industry), Skelly Oil, Getty Oil and CITGO. In addition, ConocoPhillips was headquartered in nearby Bartlesville. Industry consolidation and increased <b>offshore</b> <b>drilling</b> threatened Tulsa's status as an oil capital, but new drilling techniques and the rise of natural gas has buoyed the growth of the city's energy sector.|$|E

5|$|Jewell's {{first order}} as Secretary, issued in October 2013, {{established}} {{a process for}} the Department of the Interior to offset large development projects with conservation efforts. The effort was an extension of existing programs that use fees for <b>offshore</b> <b>drilling</b> permits to expand or build parks. At the same time, Jewell publicly pledged to work with President Obama to preserve mountains and rivers, with or without Congressional action. Existing laws, such as the 1906 Antiquities Act, give the president broad authority to preserve land, a power Jewell indicated she and the President were prepared to use {{as part of a}} balanced approach between development and conservation.|$|E
5|$|On April 20, 2010, an {{explosion}} destroyed an <b>offshore</b> <b>drilling</b> rig at the Macondo Prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, causing a major sustained oil leak. Obama visited the Gulf, announced a federal investigation, {{and formed a}} bipartisan commission to recommend new safety standards, after a review by Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and concurrent Congressional hearings. He then announced a six-month moratorium on new deepwater drilling permits and leases, pending regulatory review. As multiple efforts by BP failed, some {{in the media and}} public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident, and stated a desire for more involvement by Obama and the federal government.|$|E
5|$|Ford {{described}} {{the election of}} judges by popular vote as a major goal and supported {{increasing the number of}} judges. He supported giving more authority to law enforcement, including the ability to search people on parole and probation without warrant, making attempted murder a crime with lifelong sentence, and increasing penalties for possession of illegal guns. Ford is a proponent of stricter regulations of the financial industry. He sponsored a 2006 ban on payday lending, which was shown to discriminate against African Americans. In 2008, Ford blocked all House bills in the Senate until the bill was taken up. The bill failed in the Senate by a close vote and was heavily amended so lenders would not be banned but restricted. The bill then passed with Ford voting in favor but failed to advance after changes made in the House. A bill preventing consumers from taking out more than one loan at a time passed the House in 2009. Ford supported <b>offshore</b> <b>drilling,</b> stating conservation was not a priority for most citizens of the state. Geologists believe there is little oil to be found off the South Carolina coast. Ford wants to prevent the widening of Interstate 26 through Charleston, calling instead for a study for transportation needs. Ford emphasized the need for more funding for school programs, which he claimed is necessary due to the small number of pupils attending college and to remedy lacks of knowledge in geography and civics, which he wants reinstated as a school subject. Ford was told about favoritism, intimidation and racism in the South Carolina Highway Patrol and publicized it with Glenn McConnell. Subsequently, director and deputy director of the South Carolina Department of Public Safety resigned under pressure from governor Mark Sanford.|$|E
