5|$|Algorithmic {{analysis}} {{of images of}} artworks, for example using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, can reveal information about art. Such techniques can uncover images in layers <b>of</b> <b>paint</b> later covered over by an artist; help art historians to visualize an artwork before it cracked or faded; help to tell a copy from an original, or distinguish the brushstroke style of a master from those of his apprentices.|$|E

5|$|In 1939, the {{lighthouse}} underwent major repairs for its anniversary. As {{part of those}} renovations, the tower was painted with high quality oil paint, which became the main contributor to {{the deterioration of the}} tower in subsequent decades– thick waterproof layers <b>of</b> <b>paint</b> did not allow the limestone to dry. The mortar began to deteriorate rapidly.|$|E

5|$|Marigene Butler, head {{conservator}} at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, oversaw a multi-national {{research project}} between 1983 and 1989. Her team investigated the provenance {{of the two}} paintings and relationships between them through technical analyses. At that time both paintings underwent further restorations. They examined the wooden supports, parchment fibres and priming layers of the Philadelphia painting. A sample <b>of</b> <b>paint</b> {{was taken from the}} seraph-Christ's wings; analysis found particles of pure ultramarine, the most expensive pigment at the time. The team identified red organic lake in the stigmata wounds, and vermilion and lead white on Francis's cheeks. Infrared reflectography found a base layer <b>of</b> <b>paint</b> overlaid with hatching and fine brush strokes on an additional layer. The greenery was painted with a copper resinate that over time has darkened to brown. The mountains and sky were painted with ultramarine and lead white. Compared to the Turin painting, the Philadelphia version shows little evidence of underdrawing.|$|E

5|$|The {{bridge was}} closed to motor {{vehicles}} on 15 February 2010 for refurbishment and strengthening. It was originally expected to remain closed for approximately 18 months, but after {{the condition of the}} bridge was found to be worse than expected, it was closed for 22 months. All of the timber in the decking as well as the footway that had rotted away were replaced, with additional timber added for strengthening. Surfaces at the carriageway and pavement decking were replaced. New steel structures were added to strengthen the bridge. All the lightbulbs were changed to more energy-efficient ones. The tollbooths were refurbished. All twelve layers <b>of</b> <b>paint</b> were stripped down until the bare metal was exposed, which was repaired and treated before three new coats <b>of</b> <b>paint</b> were added. The whole project cost £7.2 million of which the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea provided 25% of the cost and the other 75% was provided by Transport for London.|$|E
5000|$|His {{main focus}} {{is more in}} the {{ideology}} <b>of</b> <b>painting</b> itself rather than in expanding the field <b>of</b> <b>painting.</b> He represents the younger generation of artists, who problematise the field <b>of</b> <b>painting</b> {{through the use of}} media image and a free relationship with various technological processes. He deconstructs the social role <b>of</b> <b>painting</b> and the position of the viewer. The theme of his paintings is often media, especially film, which continues to shape his perception most today.|$|R

5|$|Van Gogh {{used the}} Impressionist concept of broken color to give light to a work, innovatively drawing in color, giving the {{painting}} light and form, as {{he also did}} in his paintings of plowed fields, mountains, rocks, and heads and figures.

5|$|A {{number of}} {{alterations}} are {{visible to the}} naked eye as pentimenti. A piece of paper draped over the edge of the table is clearly visible in outline, despite having been painted over with detailing of the table itself. Sigismunda's index finger which was bent towards and perhaps touching the heart has been straightened, but the outline of the tip is still visible on the surface of the heart. A looped cord in the top right-hand corner is poorly concealed under the topmost layer <b>of</b> <b>paint.</b> It is also known that, to attempt to appease critics, Hogarth repainted the fingers of Sigismunda so that the blood that was previously there would no longer be visible.|$|E
5|$|Before {{applying}} the top coats <b>of</b> <b>paint,</b> the LMS would apply a matt undercoat of shop grey {{in which it}} was customary to photograph the locomotive for the first time. The ensuing LMS top coats for the Coronation Class came in two basic colours during this period: Caledonian blue and crimson lake. Linings for streamliners involved the renowned 'speed whiskers' comprising stripes emerging from a fixed point in the lower centre of the front of the locomotive to run in parallel along the sides. Non-streamliners carried the standard LMS-style lining.|$|E

5|$|Etty {{generally}} finished life studies {{during three}} evenings sittings. On the first evening he would sketch {{the model in}} charcoal or chalk, and then ink in the outline. On the second he used oil paints {{to fill in the}} figures. On the third he layered glaze and the final coverings <b>of</b> <b>paint.</b> He usually painted on millboard, re-using the reverse for fresh paintings. His female models were typically shop-girls, prostitutes, actresses or poses plastiques models, while his male models tended to be Life Guards recruited from the nearby barracks, who he thought to have an appropriate muscular physique, or occasionally men Etty met in public bath houses.|$|E

5|$|In 1880, {{the leading}} {{industries}} of St. Louis included brewing, flour milling, slaughtering, paper making, machining, and tobacco processing. Other industries including the manufacture <b>of</b> <b>paint,</b> bricks, and iron. During the 1880s, the city grew in population by 29 percent, from 350,518 to 451,770, {{making it the}} country's fourth largest city; it also ranked fourth as measured by value of its manufactured products, and more than 6,148 factories existed in 1890. However, during the 1890s, manufacturing growth slowed dramatically. The Panic of 1893 and subsequent depression and the overproduction of grain made St. Louis mills considerably less productive and valuable. Flour milling was halved and most other industries suffered similar declines.|$|E

Although he was familiar with Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism, and was endowed with a kind, sentimental and sincere heart, the abnormality of political ruling of Meng and Yuan Dynasty together with his obstinate and unruly character determined since his birth his destiny [...] - living in seclusion. He re-organized the value system of human being and established a virtual spiritual homeland. His art <b>of</b> <b>painting</b> was a monument which stood like a giant {{at the top of}} the world ethnic arts, with an intangible, cold, secluded and lonely style <b>of</b> <b>painting.</b> It was Ni Yun-lin who pushed the quality <b>of</b> <b>painting</b> to perfection which was most impressive...|$|R

In 2002, the ride celebrated its 50 millionth rider. Ten years after the 50 millionth rider, the park celebrated the Giant Dipper's 60 millionth rider on July 27, 2012. The park gave out trivia coasters leading up to the event. The 24 riders that were on the train when it hit 60 million riders received a hoodie among other prizes.|$|E
5|$|Late {{one night}} in 1997, Boston Herald {{reporter}} Tom Mashberg was driven to a warehouse in Red Hook, Brooklyn by William Youngworth {{to see what was}} purported to be The Storm on the Sea of Galilee. Youngworth was a career criminal and associate to New England art thief Myles Connor Jr. Mashberg had been investigating the theft and was briefly allowed to view the painting with a flashlight. He was given a vial <b>of</b> <b>paint</b> chips for authenticity. These were later confirmed by experts to be fragments of Dutch 17th-century origin—but not from the stolen painting. It was never concretely determined to be real or fake, and the FBI quit speaking to Youngworth after not making any progress. The painting has since disappeared.|$|E
5|$|More recent {{research}} from art historians such as Lorne Campbell relies on X-ray and infrared photography {{to develop an}} understanding of the techniques and materials used by the painters. The conservation of the Ghent Altarpiece in the mid-1950s pioneered methodologies and scholarship in technical studies. Examination <b>of</b> <b>paint</b> layers and underlayers was later applied to other Netherlandish works, allowing for more accurate attributions. Van Eyck's work, for example, typically shows underdrawings unlike Christus' work. These discoveries, too, hint at the relationships between the masters of the first rank and those in the following generations, with Memling's underdrawings clearly showing van der Weyden's influence.|$|E
