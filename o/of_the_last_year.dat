5|$|Following a long {{fight against}} cancer, {{spending}} most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> {{of his life}} in and out of hospital, Odlum died on 28 September 2003 in Tapion Hospital, Castries, aged 69. The body lay in state on 5 October, where it was viewed by Pearlette Louisy, Kenny Anthony, and members of the Cabinet. Odlum's funeral was held on 6 October, with a 30-vehicle procession travelling from Vieux Fort to Castries; it was led by a pair of police outriders and a coach carrying the coffin, draped in the national flag. St Lucian citizens were reported to be openly weeping at Odlum's death. The funeral itself was held in a park, due to no church in Castries being large enough to hold the number of mourners. During the service, sections of his most famous speeches were broadcast from loudspeakers. James Fletcher, a Cabinet Secretary, had previously announced that all flags would be flown at half-mast for the day as a tribute.|$|E

25|$|Dental {{school is}} four {{academic}} years in duration and {{is similar in}} format to medical school: two years of basic medical and dental sciences, followed by two years of clinical training (with continued didactic coursework).

25|$|In , Williams {{employed}} the Supertec engine, {{which was a}} rebadged Mecachrome-Renault unit, and a new driver line-up. Villeneuve moved to the new British American Racing (BAR) team and Frentzen moved to the Jordan team.

Alex Zanardi, an Italian driver who had won the last two CART series championships, also joined the team after Williams had spent the better part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> trying to sign him. The team managed three podiums, all scored by Ralf Schumacher, with third place in Australia and Britain and a second place in Italy. The team finished fifth in the Constructors' Championship, the lowest finish for Williams in the 1990s; the team finished behind Stewart and Jordan, scoring a total of 35 points. Of those points, all were scored by Schumacher as Zanardi, who had not performed well in his previous stint in F1, failed to finish in the top six in any race. At the end of the season, Williams bought out Zanardi's contract.|$|E

2500|$|The 2010–11 season {{would bring}} a new look to the Edmonton Oilers line-up, when Shawn Horcoff was {{selected}} to succeed Ethan Moreau as team captain. Horcoff had become the Oilers longest-serving player by this point. Taylor Hall, Jordan Eberle and Magnus Paajarvi would all make their NHL debuts for the team. Despite the influx of their young talent, Edmonton would still find themselves {{at the bottom of}} the standings. In an attempt to gain valuable prospects and draft picks, Dustin Penner was traded from the Oilers to Los Angeles on February 28, 2011, in exchange for Colten Teubert, a first-round draft pick in 2011 (Oscar Klefbom) and a conditional third-round pick in 2012. At the end of the season, the Oilers were {{at the bottom of the}} standings and received the right to choose first overall in the upcoming 2011 NHL Entry Draft.

2500|$|Just {{as there}} are no rights to paid annual leave or maximum hours, there are no rights to paid time off for child care or family leave in federal law. There are minimal rights in some states. Most {{collective}} agreements, and many individual contracts, provide paid time off, but employees who lack bargaining power will often get none. There are, however, limited federal rights to unpaid leave for family and medical reasons. The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 generally applies to employers of 50 or more employees in 20 weeks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year,</b> and gives rights to employees who have worked over 12 months and 1250 hours in the last year. Employees can have up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for child birth, adoption, {{to care for a}} close relative in poor health, or because of an employee's own poor health. Child care leave should be taken in one lump, unless agreed otherwise. Employees must give notice of 30 days to employers if birth or adoption is [...] "foreseeable", and for serious health conditions if practicable. Treatments should be arranged [...] "so as not to disrupt unduly the operations of the employer" [...] according to medical advice. Employers must provide benefits during the unpaid leave. Under §2652(b) states are empowered to provide [...] "greater family or medical leave rights". In 2016 California, New Jersey, Rhode Island and New York had laws for paid family leave rights. Under §2612(2)(A) an employer can make an employee substitute the right to 12 unpaid weeks of leave for [...] "accrued paid vacation leave, personal leave or family leave" [...] in an employer's personnel policy. Originally the Department of Labor had a penalty to make employers notify employees that this might happen. However, five judges in the US Supreme Court in Ragsdale v Wolverine World Wide, Inc held that the statute precluded the right of the Department of Labor to do so. Four dissenting judges would have held that nothing prevented the rule, and it was the Department of Labor's job to enforce the law. After unpaid leave, an employee generally has the right to return to his or her job, except for employees who are in the top 10% of highest paid and the employer can argue refusal [...] "is necessary to prevent substantial and grievous economic injury to the operations of the employer." [...] Employees or the Secretary of Labor can bring enforcement actions, but there is no right to a jury for reinstatement claims. Employees can seek damages for lost wages and benefits, or the cost of child care, plus an equal amount of liquidated damages unless an employer can show it acted in good faith and reasonable cause to believe it was not breaking the law. There is a two-year limit on bringing claims, or three years for willful violations. Despite the lack of rights to leave, there is no right to free child care or day care. This has encouraged several proposals to create a public system of free child care, or for the government to subsize parents' costs.|$|E
