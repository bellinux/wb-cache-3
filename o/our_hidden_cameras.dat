5000|$|The series uses a <b>hidden</b> <b>camera</b> format, playing {{harmless}} {{but very}} amusing pranks on unsuspecting subjects while <b>hidden</b> <b>cameras</b> capture their responses. Each episode presents {{an average of}} about 10 pranks. What sets this program apart from other <b>hidden</b> <b>camera</b> shows, however, is that it has an erotic element infused into each gag. Thus the name, [...] "Naked and Funny" [...] as well as the series’ logline: [...] "The <b>hidden</b> <b>camera</b> series with an erotic twist." [...] For example, a waitress in a restaurant comes to take an unsuspecting client's order and comes back with his food wearing nothing but lingerie. In the same show, an unsuspecting young lady is pulled over by a cop who gets out of his car and starts stripping for her. All segments are filmed without any dialogue; the audio has sound effects, a laugh track, and music specially composed by Edward Tsyselsky and Sergei Shustov for the series’ producer, AFL Productions. All gags are filmed in Odessa, Ukraine.|$|R

The main focus is dedicated to two investigative reports, which are significant {{for the development of}} tapping and <b>hidden</b> <b>camera</b> reporting in Czech Republic. The thesis aims to answer two fundamental questions. Under what circumstances are tapping and <b>hidden</b> <b>camera</b> ethically acceptable and secondly whether it is possible to define the border between ethical and non-ethical approach to it...|$|R

50|$|Another type {{of reality}} {{programming}} features <b>hidden</b> <b>cameras</b> rolling when random passers-by encounter a staged situation. Candid Camera, which first aired {{on television in}} 1948, pioneered the format. Modern variants {{of this type of}} production include Punk'd, Trigger Happy TV, Primetime: What Would You Do?, The Jamie Kennedy Experiment and Just for Laughs: Gags. The series Scare Tactics and Room 401 are hidden-camera programs in which the goal is to frighten contestants rather than just befuddle or amuse them. Not all <b>hidden</b> <b>camera</b> shows use strictly staged situations. For example, the syndicated program Cheaters purports to use <b>hidden</b> <b>cameras</b> to record suspected cheating partners, although the authenticity of the show has been questioned, and even refuted by some who have been featured on the series. Once the evidence has been gathered, the accuser confronts the cheating partner {{with the assistance of the}} host. In many special-living documentary programs, <b>hidden</b> <b>cameras</b> are set up all over the residence in order to capture moments missed by the regular camera crew, or intimate bedroom footage.|$|R
