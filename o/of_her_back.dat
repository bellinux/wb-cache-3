25|$|Nadia Comăneci {{needed a}} score of 9.925 to tie or more than that to win the gold outright. The last time she had scored as high as this in an AA final was at the 76 Olympics. Out of the 100 {{optional}} beam exercises performed at the 1980 Olympics only 1 scored as high as Comaneci needed. After one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> flips Comaneci had to flail her arms for balance. She broke the connection between her aerial walkover to aerial cartwheel with a pause. Her knee bent slightly under 360-degree rotation. She landed slightly askew, taking a step back (normally a 0.1 deduction).|$|E

The tattoo is also related to her Christian beliefs. When Candice made her return, she had new tattoos on her back, her new tattoos are of five stars, which starts at the lower part <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> then finished at the middle <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E

500|$|According to Idolator and Gerrick Kennedy {{from the}} Los Angeles Times, [...] "On the Floor" [...] is {{reminiscent}} of Lopez's single, [...] "Waiting for Tonight" [...] (1999). Kennedy elaborated on the comparisons, stating that [...] "listeners haven't heard this dance-electro-pop side of Lopez since 1999... much <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> catalog flirts with more gritty urban-pop sounds." [...] Editors for the New York Daily News made some comparisons between [...] "On the Floor" [...] and another RedOne production, Kat DeLuna's 2010 single, [...] "Party O'Clock". DeLuna's song contains the lyrics [...] "Party in Ibiza, Party in New York/All the way to Africa/Love in the Caribbean/On my way to Vegas" [...] whereas Lopez sings the nearly identical line, [...] "Brazil, Morocco/London to Ibiza/Straight to L.A. New York/Vegas to Africa." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 1962 {{the first}} inklings of a {{possible}} Profumo-Keeler-Ivanov triangle had been hinted, in coded terms, in the gossip column of the society magazine Queen. Under the heading [...] "Sentences I'd like to hear the end of" [...] appeared the wording: [...] "...called in MI5 because every time the chauffeur-driven Zils drew up at her front door, out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> door into a chauffeur-driven Humber slipped..." [...] Keeler was then in New York with Rice-Davies, in an abortive attempt to launch their modelling careers there. On her return, to counter Gordon's threats, Keeler formed a relationship with Johnny Edgecombe, an ex-merchant seaman from Antigua, with whom she lived {{for a while in}} Brentford, just west of London. [...] Edgecombe was similarly [...] possessive; he and Gordon clashed [...] violently on 27 October 1962, when [...] Edgecombe slashed his rival with a knife. Keeler broke with Edgecombe shortly afterwards because of his domineering behaviour.|$|E
500|$|When {{producing}} Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, co-director Takeshi Nozue {{had difficulty}} developing {{a framework for}} Tifa's body that was [...] "balanced, yet showed off her feminine qualities." [...] Her outfit too was redesigned at this point, with emphasis on expressing those qualities, while still being pleasing to the eye. A white tank top with black zipped up vest covers her front, a pink ribbon wraps around her left biceps, and boots cover her feet. A black buttoned-up skirt covers her thighs, and she wears shorts beneath, {{with a piece of}} cloth similar to a coattail extending {{from the back of the}} skirt's waistband and ending at her ankles. While her gloves remain, they are worn only during the film's fight scenes. Her hairstyle was changed to end at the middle <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>back,</b> with the removal of the dolphin tail from her original design. This alteration was because of the difficulty of animating her original length of hair, as well as problems that arose due to its black color and lighting.|$|E

500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave a mixed {{review of}} Most Wanted, stating that [...] "hardcore fans will be hard-pressed {{for a reason}} to add this to their collection" [...] and that the new songs—"Wake Up", [...] "Beat of My Heart" [...] and [...] "Break My Heart"—"sound a bit like leftovers". Although he wrote that Most Wanted [...] "isn't a terrible album by any means, it's not {{particularly}} a good one, since Duff's two pop albums [...] have distinctive personalities that don't necessarily mesh together , and are both more fun than this." [...] Bill Lamb of About.com noted that the three new songs [...] "seem to be marking time instead of finding a new direction" [...] but said that [...] " [...] remaining bulk of this collection is strong." [...] Anthony Miccio, from the Baltimore City Paper, wrote that the album [...] "doesn't signify the closure of a brief career" [...] but is [...] "meant to satisfy an audience that won't be offended by the opportunity to buy their favorite songs again and again." [...] He noted that Duff's voice was not strong enough and stated that the [...] "rock tracks are surprisingly sluggish." [...] Talia Kraines of BBC Music commented that [...] "... there isn't enough here to warrant a purchase if you're already the owner <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> catalogue. But if you're after your first taste of Duff-flavoured pop to listen to in the background as you do your homework, then this album can do no harm." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "The Silence" [...] was {{directed}} by Nzingha Stewart before the video for [...] "All Night Long" [...] was shot. The video was shot in black and white, and features Burke in different outfits and dresses, {{as well as in}} a variety of sets with props. It begins with a couple of establishing shots of Burke of her posing with a balloon wearing and in another set where she is sitting on music speakers. Throughout the video, Burke is visibly in a studio with different backdrops, where she is preparing to be photographed. During the first verse, Burke is shown in the two sets while she sings the lyrics. Prior to the first chorus, a new set is introduced of Burke wearing a black dress which exposes all <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> while sitting {{on the floor next to}} a stereo. During the first verse, all three sets show Burke carrying out different tasks with he props, as well as a new set where she sits in front of a white backdrop in a plain white oversized shirt. As the second verse begins, the set of Burke sitting on the floor next to a stereo changes to that of her standing up in front of a microphone singing the lyrics, with the backdrop of a city skyline. During the second verse, another set is introduced of Burke posing against a stuffed animal. During the bridge, Burke sings the lyrics standing in front of the camera without any props surrounding her; prior to sustaining a long note, Burke has her back to the camera and is nude from the waist up. During the final verse, Burke's anger and desperation is shown to be heightened, as she sings to her herself in the mirror and places more emphasis on her movement. The video ends with the singer nude from the waist up and facing the camera, covering herself with her arms crossed over her chest.|$|E

2500|$|The video's concept shows Rihanna {{travelling}} around {{various locations}} [...] "looking {{for a male}} partner who will please her". The video begins with a shot of flowing water {{which appears to be}} set in a dark swamp-like area. Rihanna's head is then shown hovering above the water as she begins the first verse. She is then presented as a reptilian creature as part <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> is lifted above the water. Rihanna then exits the water, showing a scale ensemble, much like a reptile, which covers her breasts. As the bridge begins, a close up of Rihanna's face is shown, half covered in a shawl, identical to the single cover. Choreography then begins as the singer is shown with a group of male dancers behind her, wearing tribal costumes in what appears to be an Egyptian desert. Rihanna dons a zebra-print outfit with oversized red trousers as she puts on a fast-paced routine against the backdrop of pyramids. Empty tree branches are shown, as well as a fire and a starry sky. Scenes of a nude Rihanna are intercut, holding a whip made of hair, while simultaneously covering her breasts.|$|E
2500|$|Liberty is a [...] tall statue made of Carrara marble which symbolizes {{liberty in}} the form of a young woman with {{idealized}} features. She stands with legs slightly apart and her proper left foot positioned in front of her body, while her proper right foot points away from her body at an approximately 45° angle. She wears a Hellenistic tunic which is pinned at each shoulder, exposing both arms and draping across her bust. The upper part of the tunic has slipped down on her proper right, exposing her shoulder. The tunic is cinched at the waist and falls in folds to her sandaled feet. Liberty is wrapped in a mantle, and gathers its folds at waist height in her proper left hand. Her proper right arm is extended towards the ground and positioned close to her body. Her proper right hand holds a long sword, the point of which rests on the base in between her feet. Liberty wears a Phrygian cap atop her hair, which is tied back at the base of her neck. One thick lock of hair falls down the middle <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>back,</b> while another is swept forward onto her proper right shoulder. The statue stands on a large square cement base which holds a black plaque that reads [...] "LIBERTY" [...] in gold letters.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of Saturday, February 17, 2007, eight {{experienced}} climbers from the Portland area ascended in sunny, mild weather.

[...] Sunday morning, they abandoned a summit attempt and descended in freezing rain and snow, visibility less than , and winds at 40 to 70mph (64 to 120km/h). At about noon, disoriented, three of the climbers and a black lab stepped off a cliff (at the [...] level at the east edge of Palmer Glacier) while tethered together and tumbled down several hundred feet of steep slope into White River Canyon. [...] One of the remaining five climbers was lowered by rope {{to search for the}} fallen group, but returned without seeing them. [...] They called for help by cell phone, and were advised of even worse weather advancing, so dug in expecting another night. [...] However, rescuers arrived and evacuated them Sunday evening. The three fallen climbers were unable to dig into solid ice to build a snow cave, so they improvised a shelter and were in hourly cell phone contact with rescuers. [...] They had a Mountain Locator Unit, sleeping bags, GPS, and a tarp. [...] The dog, Velvet, helped keep them warm. [...] Rescuers arrived Monday about 10:45 am. [...] One was hospitalized for a head injury, the others were treated for minor injuries and released. [...] The dog had broken nails and a cut on one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> legs from cold exposure.|$|E

2500|$|Her outfit in Bayonetta 2 {{was again}} {{designed}} by Shimazaki. It was generally designed more around straight lines than curves. All her jewelry and accessories were designed around this initiative apart from her glasses. There was debate {{about where to}} show skin, {{but when it was}} decided to create a cape {{at the front of the}} outfit, the front of her outfit was closed and instead they opted to show a large area <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>back.</b> For her new look, blue became a key color as opposed to the first game, where it was red: this was because water was a key theme for the second game and Hashimoto requested blue to become the design's key color. This eventually proved difficult as, combined with the black and silver incorporated into her outfit and the game's general color palette, it did not have the sharp qualities of her former appearance. Shimazaki described trying to make her stand out in her black outfit as [...] "a nightmare". Her overall design theme was [...] "solid". The character's hairstyle underwent a major redesign. Hashimoto's main reason behind this was that [...] " [...] personality is the type that would not want to remain stagnant. She would want to change her style, taste in fashion, and her costumes. Down the line in the series, she may make further changes to her appearance." [...] The texture of her outfit was designed to appear similar to leather, despite it still being made from her hair. Her new guns, Love is Blue, were also difficult to design, as making them too large or too similar in color to other elements of Bayonetta's outfit would not have fitted her. In the end, they were made a more striking shade of blue, as well as being given some gold to match Bayonetta's chestpiece and a silver sheen. Each of the guns, Night, Jealous, Eye and Life, were given antique charms adorned with flower designs and named according to their color and the ideas they evoked to further promote and augment the new look.|$|E
