30|$|The rest of {{this paper}} is {{structured}} as follows. In “Topic modeling” section, the general outline of how to build an application in accordance with a topic model is given. In particular, LDA and PLSA are presented by means of the terminology and notation of the document analysis context. “The development <b>of</b> a <b>topic</b> model” and “The toolkits for topic models” sections summarize a large number <b>of</b> <b>topic</b> models that evolved from LDA and the existing topic model toolkits. In “The use <b>of</b> <b>topic</b> models in bioinformatics” sections, numerous relevant papers on topic models—as applied to bioinformatics—are discussed in keeping with three themes: the tasks <b>of</b> a <b>topic</b> model, the types of models, and an analogy between the concept “document-topic-word” and a biological object. In “The trends in applications <b>of</b> <b>topic</b> models to bioinformatics” sections, we give our thoughts on some of the promising unexplored directions for the use <b>of</b> <b>topic</b> modeling in biological applications.
