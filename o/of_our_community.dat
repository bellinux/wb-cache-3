500|$|Revolutions spread {{throughout}} Europe in 1848 {{as the result}} of a widespread economic crisis. Throughout the year, Victoria and Albert complained about Foreign Secretary Palmerston's independent foreign policy, which they believed destabilised foreign European powers further. Albert was concerned for many of his royal relatives, a number of whom were deposed. He and Victoria, who gave birth to their daughter Louise during that year, spent some time away from London in the relative safety of Osborne. Although there were sporadic demonstrations in England, no effective revolutionary action took place, and Albert even gained public acclaim when he expressed paternalistic, yet well-meaning and philanthropic, views. In a speech to the Society for the Improvement of the Condition of the Labouring Classes, of which he was President, he expressed his [...] "sympathy and interest for that class <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>community</b> who have most of the toil and fewest of the enjoyments of this world".

The loss social interaction and recreation within our own homes, towns and landscapes deteriorates <b>our</b> <b>communities.</b> Recent changes in technology has removed the once strong connection each <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>communities</b> had to their landscape. The Great Lakes communities and landscapes are of the most obvious examples of the effects technology has had on the integrity <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>communities.</b> These towns were once centered both socially and economically on their landscape, their identity and culture was defined by it.

She declared: [...] "Until the American Muslim community find it in their hearts to separate themselves from their evil, radical counterparts, to condemn those who want to destroy our civilization and will fight against them, we are not obligated to open our society to any of them." [...] Ben Lemming, a Democrat candidate for the same seat, was one of the few Tennessee politicians to support the mosque project, stating: [...] "The Americans that want to build this mosque are already our neighbors.

2500|$|The project, as it {{was planned}} in 1962, would have necessitated the {{condemnation}} of about 200 homes and would have cost $35 million.

The project had serious community opposition, with the district leader of the 13th Assembly District, Arthur A. Gray, saying that the project was [...] "an unnecessary and unwarranted renovation of an antiquated elevated structure in which the transportation needs <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>community</b> are sacrificed {{for the convenience of}} the many Nassau residents who board the line at its Jamaica terminus." [...] The project was thought as becoming worthless in a few years, as Jamaica was planned to become a big shopping center, and therefore, the el would have had to come down. Suggestions were made to raze the elevated in this section to allow for a shopping mall in Woodhaven. The City Planning Commission continued to oppose the project {{on the grounds of the}} [...] "inadequacies of the project".|$|E

2500|$|Only in San Francisco {{could the}} Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence not only make their first appearance, but become {{interwoven}} {{in the cultural}} and political fabric of the city, according to scholar Cathy Glenn in the journal Theory and Event. Glenn uses the examples of San Francisco as a society of hyperpluralism, where all the groups who have called the city their home have successfully maintained their individual identities, creating a culture defined by counterculture and at times marked by political violence. The Sisters use Catholic imagery as simultaneous inspiration and fodder for parody through camp. They choose names based {{on the process of}} renaming women inducted into Catholic orders, but that suggest sexual promiscuity or that are based in absurdity: Sister Anita Blowjob, Sister GladAss of the Joyous Reserectum, Sister Hellena Handbasket, Sister Sensible Shoes, and Sister Homo Celestial, among others. They wear wimples, habits, and robes of nuns, but accessorize them garishly with baubles, beads, and whiteface make-up. Sister Phyllis Stein, the Fragrant Mistress of Sistory, asserts that there is a clear distinction between drag queens and members of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence: [...] "We're not dressed as girls, we're dressed as nuns... We definitely minister to the spiritual needs <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>community,</b> while drag queens sort of focus on camp and fun within our communities. We're very different communities. A lot of people refer to us as drag queens, but we say we're in nun drag. We are nuns." ...|$|E
