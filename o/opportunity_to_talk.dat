40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					Diabetes {{distress}} is {{a general}} term that refers to the emotional burdens, anxieties, frustrations, stressors and worries that stem from managing a severe, complex condition like Type 1 diabetes. To date there has been limited research on diabetes-related distress in younger people with Type 1 diabetes. This qualitative study aimed to identify causes of diabetes distress {{in a sample of}} young adults with Type 1 diabetes. 				 				 					 						Methods 					Semi-structured interviews with 35 individuals with Type 1 diabetes (23 &# 8211; 30 years of age). 				 				 					 						Results 					This study found diabetes related-distress to be common in a sample of young adults with Type 1 diabetes in the second phase of young adulthood (23 &# 8211; 30 years of age). Diabetes distress was triggered by multiple factors, the most common of which were: self-consciousness/stigma, day-to-day diabetes management difficulties, having to fight the healthcare system, concerns about the future and apprehension about pregnancy. A number of factors appeared to moderate distress in this group, including having <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> healthcare professionals, attending diabetes education programmes and joining peer support groups. Young adults felt that having <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> healthcare professionals about diabetes distress should be a component of standard diabetes care. 				 				 					 						Conclusions 					Some aspects of living with diabetes frequently distress young adults with Type 1 diabetes who are in their twenties. Clinicians should facilitate young adults&# 8217; attendance at diabetes education programmes, provide them with <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about their diabetes-related frustrations and difficulties and, where possible, assist in the development of peer-support networks for young adults with diabetes...|$|R

2500|$|Compression is used {{in voice}} {{communications}} in amateur radio that employ SSB modulation. [...] Often {{it is used to}} make a particular station's signal more readable to a distant station, or to make one's station's transmitted signal stand out against others. [...] This occurs especially in pileups where amateur radio stations are competing for the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to a DX station. Since an SSB signal's amplitude depends on the level of modulation, the net result is that the average amplitude of the signal and hence average transmitted power would be stronger than it would be had compression not been used. [...] Most modern amateur radio SSB transceivers have speech compressors built in.|$|E
2500|$|Council is a codified practice, {{derived from}} ancient traditions,. that {{involves}} bringing individuals {{together in a}} council circle, {{under the guidance of}} a trained facilitator, for a candid and heartfelt conversation. Within the circle, the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> is offered one-at-a-time, with the intent to speak from one’s personal experience rather than opinion. Participants are encouraged to speak authentically when it’s their turn, and to listen deeply, without comment or judgment, while others are speaking. [...] Intention is focused on the common stories, values, fears and aspirations that make one human, encouraging taking the perspective of the other and finding common ground. [...] Council is a compassion-based attentional practice that fosters greater awareness of self and others and capacity for cultivating skillful communication, respectful relationships and ethical action.|$|E

Glenn {{claims that}} Speak [...] "has generated more academic response {{than any other}} novel Anderson has written." [...] Despite hesitancy to teach a novel with [...] "mature subject matter," [...] English teachers are implementing Speak in the classroom as a study of literary analysis, as well as tool to teach students about sexual harassment. The novel gives students the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about several teen issues, including: school cliques, sex, and parental relationships. Of teaching Speak in the classroom Jackett says, [...] "We have the opportunity as English teachers to have an enormously positive impact on students' lives.

[...] By sharing in Melinda's struggles, students may find their own voices and learn to cope with trauma and hardships. According to Janet Alsup, teaching Speak in the classroom, can help students become more critically literate. Students may not feel comfortable talking about their own experiences, but they are willing to talk about what happens to Melinda. Elaine O'Quinn claims that books like Speak allow students to explore inner dialogue. Speak provides an outlet for students to think critically about their world.|$|E
