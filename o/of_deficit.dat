5|$|Deficits in {{cognitive}} abilities are {{widely recognized as}} a core feature of schizophrenia. The extent of the cognitive deficits an individual experiences is a predictor of how functional an individual will be, the quality of occupational performance, and how successful the individual will be in maintaining treatment. The presence and degree of cognitive dysfunction in individuals with schizophrenia {{has been reported to}} be a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of positive or negative symptoms. The deficits impacting the cognitive function are found in a large number of areas: working memory, long-term memory, verbal declarative memory, semantic processing, episodic memory, attention, learning (particularly verbal learning). Deficits in verbal memory are the most pronounced in individuals with schizophrenia, and are not accounted for by deficit in attention. Verbal memory impairment has been linked to a decreased ability in individuals with schizophrenia to semantically encode (process information relating to meaning), which is cited as a cause for another known deficit in long-term memory. When given a list of words, healthy individuals remember positive words more frequently (known as the Pollyanna principle); however, individuals with schizophrenia tend to remember all words equally regardless of their connotations, suggesting that the experience of anhedonia impairs the semantic encoding of the words. These deficits have been found in individuals before the onset of the illness to some extent. First-degree family members of individuals with schizophrenia and other high-risk individuals also show a degree <b>of</b> <b>deficit</b> {{in cognitive}} abilities, and specifically in working memory.A review of the literature on cognitive deficits in individuals with schizophrenia shows that the deficits may be present in early adolescence, or as early as childhood. The deficits which an individual with schizophrenia presents tend to remain the same over time in most patients, or follow an identifiable course based upon environmental variables.|$|E

25|$|Fiscal {{conservatism}} in the UK {{was arguably}} most popular during the premiership of Margaret Thatcher, who, {{after a number}} of years <b>of</b> <b>deficit</b> spending under the previous Labour government, advocated spending cuts and selective tax increases to balance the budget.

40|$|This paper extends {{a method}} of apprising health status to {{a broad range of}} ages from {{adolescence}} to old age. The “frailty index ” is based on the accumulation <b>of</b> <b>deficits</b> (symptoms, signs, disease classifications) as analyzed in the National Population Health Survey, a representative Canadian population sample (n = 81, 859). The accumulation <b>of</b> <b>deficits</b> has both an age-independent (background) component and an age-dependent (exponential) component, akin to the wellknown Gompertz-Makeham model for the risk of mortality. While women accumulate more <b>deficits</b> than men <b>of</b> the same age, on average, their rate of accumulation is lower, so the difference in the level <b>of</b> <b>deficits</b> between men and women decreases with age. Two possible invariants of the process <b>of</b> accumulation <b>of</b> <b>deficits</b> were found: (1) the age at which the average proportion <b>of</b> <b>deficits</b> coincides for men and women is 94 years, which closely matches the species-specific lifespan in humans (95 ± 2); (2) the value of the frailty index (proportion <b>of</b> <b>deficits),</b> which corresponds to that age (0. 18). The similarity between mortality kinetics and the accumulation <b>of</b> <b>deficits</b> (frailty kinetics), and the coincidence of the time parameters in the frailty and mortality models make it possible to express mortality risk in terms <b>of</b> accumulated <b>deficits.</b> This provides a simple and accessible tool that might have potential in a number of biomedical applications...|$|R
40|$|Much recent {{attention}} {{has focused on}} the large values of actual and projected federal deficits. To evaluate this discussion we must know whether these deficits represent a shift {{in the structure of the}} govern-ment's fiscal policy or are just the usual reaction to other influences, such as recession, inflation, and government spending. A related, but broader, question is whether the process that generates deficits in the post-World War II period differs systematically from that in place ear-lier-say, during the interwar period 1920 - 40. For example, has there been a change in the average deficit or in the magnitude of the coun-tercyclical response <b>of</b> <b>deficits?</b> I begin by describing the tax-smoothing theory <b>of</b> <b>deficits</b> that I developed earlier. Then I estimate this model on United States data since 1920. Basically, the results are consistent with an unchanged structure <b>of</b> <b>deficits</b> since that time.

25|$|Whatever the figures, {{towards the}} end of the 1960s it became {{increasingly}} clear that rail closures were not bringing the rail system out <b>of</b> <b>deficit</b> and were unlikely ever to do so. Transport minister Barbara Castle decided that some rail services, which could not pay their way but had a valuable social role, should be subsidised. Legislation allowing this was introduced in the 1968 Transport Act (Section 39 made provision for a subsidy to be paid by the Treasury for a three-year period) but this was later repealed in the Railways Act 1974. Whether these subsidies affected the size of the network is questionable: the criteria for reprieving loss-making lines had not altered, merely the way their costs appeared in the railways accounts—previously their contribution to the railways' overall loss was hidden in the total deficit.|$|E
25|$|In his 2009 book The Keynes Solution, post-Keynesian {{economist}} Paul Davidson makes another historical {{case for}} the effectiveness of Keynesian policy, referring {{to the experience of}} the United States during the Great Depression. He notes how economic growth and employment levels increased for four successive years as the New Deal policies were pursued by President Roosevelt. When government spending was cut back in 1937 due to concerns about the budget deficit, all the gains were lost in one year, and growth only resumed after spending increased again from 1938, as a response to growing acceptance <b>of</b> <b>deficit</b> spending in a recession and later due to World War II. For Davidson, this experience validates the view that Keynesian policy has the power to deliver full employment and prosperity for a government's entire labor force. Davidson also wrote that both price stability and employment in the Keynesian age were superior even to the classical gold standard era that was terminated by World War I.|$|E

OBJECTIVE:: To review all instruments for measuring awareness <b>of</b> <b>deficits</b> and evaluate their psychometric and conceptual properties as well as their feasibility. METHODS:: Systematic literature search for available awareness measurement instruments used in experimental ABI studies.
