5|$|Labillardière {{eventually}} {{published the}} genus Adenanthos, along with A.cuneatus {{and two other}} species, in his 1805 Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen. He chose the specific name cuneata {{in reference to the}} leaves of this species, which are cuneate (triangular). This name has feminine gender, consistent with the gender assigned by Labillardière to the genus. He did not designate which of the three published species was to serve as the type species of Adenanthos, but Irish botanist E. Charles Nelson has since chosen A.cuneatus as lectotype for the genus, since the holotype of A.cuneatus bears an annotation showing the derivation of the genus name, and because Labillardière's description <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> most detailed of the three, and is referred to by the other descriptions.|$|E
