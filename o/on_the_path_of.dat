After engaging with Kakashi and some of Konoha's forces, he reveals Akatsuki's goal to gather the Jinchuriki of the nine tailed beasts. Itachi also learns that Naruto is under the protection of Jiraiya and sets up a trap to lure the experienced ninja away to grab the boy. However, as Jiraiya comes to Naruto's aid, Itachi finds himself facing Sasuke and directs his brother back <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> getting stronger by defeating him before he and Kisame fall back.|$|E
5|$|Characteristic of Marko was his reverence {{and love}} for his mother, Jevrosima; he often sought her advice, {{following}} it even when it contradicted his own desires. She lived with Marko at his mansion in Prilep, his lodestar guiding him away from evil and toward good <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> moral improvement and Christian virtues. Marko's honesty and moral courage are noteworthy in a poem {{in which he was}} the only person who knew the will of the late Tsar Dušan regarding his heir. Marko refused to lie in favour of the pretenders—his father and uncles. He said truthfully that Dušan appointed his son, Uroš, heir to the Serbian throne. This almost cost him his life, since Vukašin tried to kill him.|$|E

5|$|Harriet Fisher Jones {{was born}} on 2 May 1841 in Warrington to her father, Evan Jones, a tinsmith, and his wife, Harriet Jones. As {{she and her mother}} shared the same name, she became better known as Jeannie. In 1860, she married a fruit merchant, Robert Willis, and the couple {{travelled}} to New York City, where she took an interest in the black rights movement. On her return to England, she and her husband settled in London and had a son, Robert Frederick Evan Willis, better known as Fred. Willis spent some time helping the poor in the slums of London. She was heavily influenced by the works of Thomas Carlyle and John Ruskin, setting her <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> socialism.|$|E
5|$|The A9, {{the great}} road {{connecting}} Edinburgh with Inverness {{and the far}} north, once ran through Evanton, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> Balconie Street. However, a bypass was created {{as part of a}} general scheme to shorten the journey between Inverness to Invergordon. This reduced the amount of traffic going through the village, but decreased the revenue available to local businesses. The road also cut through much of the farmland of the zone, distorting the shape of the fields. This was compounded by the closure of the filling station in the village. For those who do not have cars, the only means of transport is either by foot or by the #25 bus service operated by Stagecoach. Recently, the express service running from Inverness to Dornoch began to stop in Evanton. Now residents can travel from and to Inverness without the long diversion through Dingwall, making it easier to work in the city of Inverness without personal transport.|$|E
5|$|While {{the border}} on land was firmly {{set in the}} early 20th century, the two states were still in {{disagreement}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> the border to the east, in Lake Erie. In 1973, the two states finally obtained a hearing before the United States Supreme Court on their competing claims to the Lake Erie waters. In Michigan v. Ohio, the court upheld a special master's report and ruled that {{the boundary between the}} two states in Lake Erie was angled to the northeast, as described in Ohio's state constitution, and not a straight east–west line. One consequence of the court decision was that tiny Turtle Island just outside Maumee Bay and originally treated as being wholly in Michigan, was split between the two states.|$|E

5|$|Unlike in Ellendale and Georgetown, the Millsboro–South and Milford {{proposals}} faced strong opposition. In the Millsboro–South area, DelDOT's preferred alternative, the Blue Alternative, was {{an eastern}} bypass that would diverge from existing US 113 north of Selbyville; {{pass to the}} east of Frankford and Dagsboro, cross the Indian River, and parallel DE 24 west to rejoin US 113's present course north of Betts Pond north of Millsboro. US 113 would have had interchanges with DE 54 at its current junction, with DE 20 and DE 26 east of Dagsboro, with DE 24 east of Millsboro, with DE 30 north of Millsboro, and with DE 20 where the bypass rejoins the present course of US 113. However, DelDOT's preference faced opposition due to its cost, its land requirements, and a revelation that DelDOT was paying a pair of developers each month to not build <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> the proposed bypass. In response to the payment scheme, Governor Jack Markell suspended further planning work on US113 in Sussex County in January 2011. Markell indicated the project could resume if Sussex County legislators and DelDOT come up with a revised plan for the MillsboroSouth area.|$|E
