5|$|Cumulus {{supplementary}} features are most commonly {{seen with the}} species congestus. Cumulus virga clouds are cumulus clouds producing virga (precipitation that evaporates while aloft), and cumulus praecipitatio produce precipitation that reaches the Earth's surface. Cumulus pannus comprise shredded clouds that normally appear beneath the parent cumulus cloud during precipitation. Cumulus arcus clouds have a gust front, and cumulus tuba clouds have funnel clouds or tornadoes. Cumulus pileus clouds refer to cumulus clouds that have grown so rapidly as to force the formation of pileus over the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud.</b> Cumulus velum clouds have an ice crystal veil over the growing top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{liquid water}} density within a cumulus cloud {{has been found}} to change with height above the cloud base rather than being {{approximately}} constant throughout the cloud. At the cloud base, the concentration was 0grams of liquid water per kilogram of air. As altitude increased, the concentration rapidly increased to the maximum concentration near the middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud.</b> The maximum concentration was found to be anything up to 1.25grams of water per kilogram of air. The concentration slowly dropped off as altitude increased to the height of the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud,</b> where it immediately dropped to zero again.|$|E
5|$|Computer models {{suggest that}} {{collisions}} of cometary debris during the formation period play {{a far greater}} role than was previously thought. According to these models, the number of collisions early in the Solar System's history {{was so great that}} most comets were destroyed before they reached the Oort cloud. Therefore, the current cumulative mass of the Oort cloud is far less than was once suspected. The estimated mass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> is {{only a small part of}} the 50–100 Earth masses of ejected material.|$|E

5000|$|The mountaintops often offer views <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clouds</b> from above, {{known as}} <b>the</b> Sea <b>of</b> <b>Clouds</b> (...) or [...] "Huangshan Sea" [...] because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud's</b> {{resemblance}} to an ocean, and many s are known by {{names such as}} [...] "North Sea" [...] or [...] "South Sea."

5|$|In September 1894, C. T. R. Wilson was {{employed}} at the observatory {{for a couple}} of weeks as temporary relief for one of the permanent staff. During this period, he witnessed a Brocken spectre and glory, caused by the sun casting a shadow on a cloud below the observer.

5|$|In this phase, {{water vapor}} {{condenses}} on various nuclei {{present in the}} air, forming the cumulus cloud. This creates the characteristic flat-bottomed puffy shape associated with cumulus clouds. The height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> (from its bottom to its top) depends on the temperature profile of the atmosphere {{and the presence of}} any inversions. During the convection, surrounding air is entrained (mixed) with the thermal and the total mass of the ascending air increases.|$|E
5|$|Stars are {{believed}} to form {{as the result of}} a collapse of a low-temperature cloud of gas and dust. As the cloud collapses, conservation of angular momentum causes any small net rotation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> to increase, forcing the material into a rotating disk. At the dense center of this disk a protostar forms, which gains heat from the gravitational energy of the collapse.|$|E

5|$|The Sun formed about 4.6 {{billion years}} ago from the {{collapse}} of part of a giant molecular cloud that consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium and that probably gave birth to many other stars. This age is estimated using computer models of stellar evolution and through nucleocosmochronology. The result {{is consistent with the}} radiometric date of the oldest Solar System material, at 4.567 {{billion years ago}}. Studies of ancient meteorites reveal traces of stable daughter nuclei of short-lived isotopes, such as iron-60, that form only in exploding, short-lived stars. This indicates that one or more supernovae must have occurred near the location where the Sun formed. A shock wave from a nearby supernova would have triggered the formation of the Sun by compressing the matter within the molecular cloud and causing certain regions to collapse under their own gravity. As one fragment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> collapsed it also began to rotate because of conservation of angular momentum and heat up with the increasing pressure. Much of the mass became concentrated in the center, whereas the rest flattened out into a disk that would become the planets and other Solar System bodies. Gravity and pressure within the core <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> generated a lot of heat as it accreted more matter from the surrounding disk, eventually triggering nuclear fusion. Thus, the Sun was born.|$|E
5|$|A {{distinct}} defining {{feature of}} a Surtseyan eruption is {{the formation of}} a pyroclastic surge (or base surge), a ground hugging radial cloud that develops along with the eruption column. Base surges are caused by the gravitational collapse of a vaporous eruptive column, one that is denser overall then a regular volcanic column. The densest part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> is nearest to the vent, resulting a wedge shape. Associated with these laterally moving rings are dune-shaped depositions of rock left behind by the lateral movement. These are occasionally disrupted by bomb sags, rock that was flung out by the explosive eruption and followed a ballistic path to the ground. Accumulations of wet, spherical ash known as accretionary lapilli is another common surge indicator.|$|E
5|$|A non-tropical trough at {{the surface}} {{extended}} from the northern Gulf of Mexico across Florida into the western Atlantic Ocean. On August 3, the western portion developed into a low pressure area. The eastern portion slowly organized and ultimately developed into Tropical Storm Cristobal. The low pressure area in the Gulf of Mexico steadily organized, and late on August 4 the circulation was organized enough for the National Hurricane Center to classify it as Tropical Depression Two while located 40miles (65km) east of Port Eads, Louisiana. Northeasterly wind shear initially prevented organization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> pattern, though the depression was able to strengthen to become Tropical Storm Bertha about five hours after it formed.|$|E

5|$|Film badges used {{to measure}} {{exposure}} to radioactivity indicated that no observers at N-10,000 {{had been exposed to}} more than 0.1 roentgens, but the shelter was evacuated before the radioactive cloud could reach it. The explosion was more efficient than expected and the thermal updraft drew most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> high enough that little fallout fell on the test site. The crater was far more radioactive than expected due to the formation of trinitite, and the crews of the two lead-lined Sherman tanks were subjected to considerable exposure. Anderson's dosimeter and film badge recorded 7 to 10 roentgens, and one of the tank drivers, who made three trips, recorded 13 to 15 roentgens.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{exited the}} mass of {{aircraft}} and was immediately attacked by three Bf 109s. The closest was 100 yards away. Maintaining a steep, tight, spiralling turn, he dived into cloud and immediately headed for Dover. Coming out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud,</b> Johnson saw a lone Bf 109. Suspecting it {{to be one of}} the three that had chased him, he searched for the other two. Seeing nothing, Johnson attacked and shot it down. It was his fourth victory. Johnson ended his month's tally by adding a probable victory on 21 August. But it had been a bad day and month for the Wing. The much loathed Circus and Rhubarb raids had cost Fighter Command 108 fighters. The Germans lost just 18. On 4 September 1941 Johnson was promoted to flight lieutenant and awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC).|$|E
5|$|Located {{mostly in}} Dorado, the Large Magellanic Cloud extends into Hydrus. The {{globular}} cluster NGC 1466 is an outlying {{component of the}} galaxy, and contains many RR Lyrae-type variable stars.

5|$|Most {{stars are}} {{observed}} {{to be members}} of binary star systems, and the properties of those binaries are the result of the conditions in which they formed. A gas cloud must lose its angular momentum in order to collapse and form a star. The fragmentation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> into multiple stars distributes some of that angular momentum. The primordial binaries transfer some angular momentum by gravitational interactions during close encounters with other stars in young stellar clusters. These interactions tend to split apart more widely separated (soft) binaries while causing hard binaries to become more tightly bound. This produces the separation of binaries into their two observed populations distributions.|$|E
5|$|The ice {{crystals}} in cirrus clouds have different shapes {{in addition to}} different sizes. Some shapes include solid columns, hollow columns, plates, rosettes, and conglomerations of the various other types. The shape of the {{ice crystals}} {{is determined by the}} air temperature, atmospheric pressure, and ice supersaturation. Cirrus in temperate regions typically have the shapes segregated by type: the columns and plates tend to be at the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud,</b> whereas the rosettes and conglomerations tend to be near the base. In the northern Arctic region, cirrus tend to be composed of only the columns, plates, and conglomerations, and these crystals tend to be at least four times larger than the minimum size. In Antarctica, cirrus are usually composed of only the columns, and these columns are much longer than normal.|$|E
5|$|Cirrocumulus clouds form in {{patches and}} cannot cast shadows. They {{commonly}} appear in regular, rippling patterns or in rows of clouds with clear areas between. Cirrocumulus are, like {{other members of}} the cumuliform and stratocumuliform categories, formed via convective processes. Significant growth of these patches indicates high-altitude instability and can signal the approach of poorer weather. The ice crystals in the bottoms of cirrocumulus clouds tend to be in the form of hexagonal cylinders. They are not solid, but instead tend to have stepped funnels coming in from the ends. Towards the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud,</b> these crystals have a tendency to clump together. These clouds do not last long, and they tend to change into cirrus because as the water vapor continues to deposit on the ice crystals, they eventually begin to fall, destroying the upward convection. The cloud then dissipates into cirrus. Cirrocumulus clouds come in four species which are common to all three genus-types that have limited-convective or stratocumuliform characteristics: stratiformis, lenticularis, castellanus, and floccus. They are iridescent when the constituent supercooled water droplets are all about the same size.|$|E
