5|$|Some anomalously old {{radiocarbon}} {{dates of}} Lake Cahuilla deposits {{may be the}} consequence of the Colorado River transporting ancient carbonates into the lake.

5|$|Another {{topic is}} the {{relationship}} between brain structures and language acquisition. Research in first language acquisition has already established that infants from all linguistic environments go through similar and predictable stages (such as babbling), and some neurolinguistics research attempts to find correlations between stages of language development and stages of brain development, while <b>other</b> <b>research</b> investigates the physical changes (known as neuroplasticity) that the brain undergoes during second language acquisition, when adults learn a new language.|$|E
5|$|Common ravens {{are known}} to steal and cache shiny objects such as pebbles, pieces of metal, and golf balls. One theory is that they hoard shiny objects to impress other ravens. <b>Other</b> <b>research</b> {{indicates}} that juveniles are deeply curious about all new things, and that common ravens retain an attraction to bright, round objects based on their similarity to bird eggs. Mature birds lose their intense interest in the unusual, and become highly neophobic.|$|E
5|$|Diseases, accidents, hunters, automobiles, and {{starvation}} are {{the other}} leading causes of death. Juveniles show high mortality shortly after leaving their mothers, while still perfecting their hunting techniques. One study of 15 bobcats showed yearly survival rates for both sexes averaged 0.62, in line with <b>other</b> <b>research</b> suggesting rates of 0.56 to 0.67. Cannibalism has been reported; kittens may be taken when prey levels are low, but this is very rare and does not much influence the population.|$|E

5|$|Haddam Island State Park {{is home to}} a {{large number}} of bird species, {{especially}} during annual migrations, which make it suitable for birdwatching. Bird-banding and <b>other</b> <b>research</b> activities have taken place on the island. Other recommended activities are boating and fishing. Access via boat is available from the Haddam Meadows State Park boat launch, a half mile south of Haddam Island. The northern side of the island has a beach that is fragile and cannot support heavy visitation, and the island has a significant amount of poison ivy.|$|E
5|$|Leaders' ideological {{power was}} based on {{apparent}} access to deities and the supernatural. Evidence regarding Norte Chico religion is limited: {{an image of the}} Staff God, a leering figure with a hood and fangs, has been found on a gourd dated to 2250 BC. The Staff God is a major deity of later Andean cultures, and Winifred Creamer suggests the find points to worship of common symbols of gods. As with much <b>other</b> <b>research</b> at Norte Chico, the nature and significance of the find has been disputed by other researchers.|$|E

5|$|Linnaeus, who {{classified}} most {{kinds of}} sessile animals {{as belonging to}} the order Zoophyta in the class Vermes, mistakenly identified the genus Spongia as plants in the order Algae. For a long time thereafter sponges were assigned to a separate subkingdom, Parazoa ("beside the animals"), separate from the Eumetazoa which formed {{the rest of the}} kingdom Animalia. They have been regarded as a paraphyletic phylum, from which the higher animals have evolved. <b>Other</b> <b>research</b> indicates Porifera is monophyletic.|$|E
5|$|Pfizer, {{once the}} city's second largest employer, {{operated}} a large pharmaceutical research facility {{on the northeast}} side of Ann Arbor. On January 22, 2007, Pfizer announced it would close operations in Ann Arbor {{by the end of}} 2008. The facility was previously operated by Warner-Lambert and, before that, Parke-Davis. In December 2008, the University of Michigan Board of Regents approved the purchase of the facilities, and the university anticipates hiring 2,000 researchers and staff during the next 10 years. The city is the home of <b>other</b> <b>research</b> and engineering centers, including those of Lotus Engineering, General Dynamics and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). <b>Other</b> <b>research</b> centers sited in the city are the United States Environmental Protection Agency's National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory and the Toyota Technical Center.

5|$|Recent {{research}} into Pattle's claims {{has shown that}} at least 27 claimed victories can be directly linked to specific Italian and German losses, while only six claims are discounted as no Axis losses are recorded. <b>Other</b> <b>research</b> dedicated {{to the history of}} German bomber units, some of which took part in the air battles against Pattle's unit, have drawn {{attention to the fact that}} 97–98 percent of all German primary records belonging to the Luftwaffe have been lost either through Allied bombing or through Hermann Göring's order to destroy all records in the first week of May 1945. This makes any {{research into}} German losses difficult.|$|E

5|$|The exact {{location}} of Fort Prudhomme is unknown. Some historians claim that Fort Prudhomme {{was built on}} the first Chickasaw Bluff, in modern-day Lauderdale County. The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture suggests that the fort was constructed on the second Chickasaw Bluff near modern-day Randolph. <b>Other</b> <b>research</b> mentions the third Chickasaw Bluff as the location of the fort, at the border of modern Tipton and Shelby Counties. Again other sources assume that the fourth Chickasaw Bluff in modern Shelby County at Memphis was the location of Fort Prudhomme.|$|E
5|$|The growth {{witnessed}} {{in the late}} 1970s and early 1980s was interrupted by another U.S. recession in 1981, in which silver, timber, and farm prices dropped. The period of decline for the city lasted into the 1990s and was also marked by a loss of many steady family-wage jobs in the manufacturing sector. Although this was a tough period, Spokane's economy had started to benefit from some measure of economic diversification; growing companies such as Key Tronic and <b>other</b> <b>research,</b> marketing, and assembly plants for technology companies helped lessen Spokane's dependence on natural resources.|$|E
