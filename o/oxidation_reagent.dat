Obviously, in this progress a large-scale GO acts with dual functions, as a reducing reagent and a nucleation site of metal or metal oxide nanoparticles.

40|$|Arsenic {{contaminated}} waters are not uncommon; indeed from naturally occurring {{contaminated waters}} through {{to those that}} are {{a direct consequence of}} human activities such as mining, all are affecting the quality of water resources worldwide. The ever increasing demands on natural water resources mean that the effective control of this toxic contaminant is paramount and this is reflected in the ever increasing global legislation. There are currently three mechanisms by which arsenic is commercially treated in effluents. These are physical separation processes such as reverse osmosis, precipitation/adsorption processes, some of which are bacterially assisted, and a whole variety of ion exchange processes, again with some bacterial enhancement. The choice of treatment is not only driven by cost but by the chemistry of the water and the water quality standard to be met. In this study a very high arsenic enriched groundwater, containing in excess of 25, 000 µg/L arsenic, was treated by a typical treatment method through a continuously operated pilot plant. In the treatment, iron III salts were added to the influent in order to form precipitates with the arsenic and to form an adsorptive surface that would assist with treatment of the enriched water. This addition of iron III salts for the removal of arsenic is common practice in the water treatment industry as the resulting iron III arsenates are highly stable. However, results from the pilot plant show that the process was further enhanced by the small addition hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide is a powerful oxidising reagent and assists in ensuring the complete conversion of any arsenic III to arsenic V that was then effectively removed in the pilot plant.

40|$|Most {{experiments}} for {{the chemical}} transformation of polymers {{start from the}} assumption that the reactivity of a functional group in a macromolecule has to be the same as one in a low molecular compound. But it turns out that usually the reaction on the polymer is faster or slower than the reaction of the model compound, or the reaction with the polymer proceeds in a different way and the reaction products differ from those of the model compound. These pheno-mena are called 'polymeric effects'. It depends on the property to be compared as to which model reflects the polymer in the best way. These general consider-ations are exemplified by three reactions. (a) The optical and chiroptical properties of polymers with atropisomeric groups in the pendant sidegroups and in the backbone are the same as for three low-mokcular model compounds. But the racemization rates of the polymers are much slower than those of the models. (b) Electron-donor—acceptor complexes between polyesters with fluorene rings and TCNQ or TCNE were prepared and compared with the corres-ponding models. The value of the equilibrium constant (K) is only reached by models with at least two donor groups per molecule. In the oligomcr range, the constant K depends upon the degree of polymerization. The presence of neighbouring donor groups seems to be the cause of the greater stability of the polymer complex. Cc) Preparation and properties of N-chlorinated nylon 66 is described. The i. r. spectra are the same as those of the model compounds but the reactivity of the chlorine is usually different.

Wet oxidation offers a possibility to reduce the pollutant content in the water. Comparative experiments of the efficiency of oxidation initiated by radicals were carried out, using as heterogeneous catalysis on strap catalyst base as cavitation. By means of the wet oxidation on strap catalyst base with H_ 2 O_ 2 as <b>oxidation</b> <b>reagent</b> it was possible, to decontaminate effectively as single pollutants in model sewages as complex substance mixtures in real sewages. The tested catalytic systems worked especially effectively for high pollutant concentrations. At lower concentrations of sewage pollutants the amount of H_ 2 O_ 2 must be increased in regard to the actual CSB. In real sewages the pollutant decrease was, related on the TOC, in the cut, at 50 %, a raise of the average concentration of the oxidation agent didn't produce any further decrease of the pollutant concentration. Aromatic hydrocarbons could be reduced more effectively than aliphatic ones. The conception for a technical plant was developed including cost estimate. The reduction of pollutants by cavitation was fundamentally lower than by using the heterogeneous catalysis way. Without addition of an oxidation agent (i. e. H_ 2 O_ 2) only a TOC decrease of approx. 15 % was registered in real sewages. The pollutant reduction increased at higher pollutant concentration. A complete elimination of all pollutants could not be obtained in none of the examined cases neither at model nor at real sewages. Especially the long reaction times (6 to 24 h) of the cavitation process in comparison with those, necessary for the catalytic reaction (2 to 6 h) are hindering a technical realization of the cavitation process, which seems to be doubtful for this and other reasons. So the use of cavitation in industrial scale sewage cleaning plants under the parameter conditions tested in the project has no chance to be realized as by technically as by economical reasons.

The ion source, an instrumental part for converting the analyte into ions, has {{played an important role}} in analyzing biological specimens by MS. However, the performance of conventional spray-based ionization methods always suffers from chemical interferences derived from complex biological matrices. A series of sample extraction, purification, and separation steps is required before the ionization, so as to ensure excellent performance of MS analysis. In order to simplify the MS procedure, ambient mass spectrometry (AMS) was developed, where the analyte can be directly sampled and ionized from complex biological matrices without or with minimal sample preparation. It is beneficial if the developed methods can be appropriately used in wide applications. At the same time, the simple procedure is complicated by declining qualitative and quantitative performance. The goal of the present research is to develop and improve spray-based AMS methods to meet real applications. Three problems need to be solved to meet with the aim: (1) How to collect and process the sample according to its physical and chemical characterizations. (2) How to effectively extract and ionize the target analyte with reduction of matrix effect. (3) How to produce sufficient and accurate structural and quantitative information on the mass spectrum. In this study, paper spray as a new spray-base AMS method has been used for two applications: (1) Direct drug abuse monitoring for forensic and therapeutic use and (2) Quick screening of antibiotics in food for the food safety. In addition to selecting proper paper substrates and solvents, the quantitative performance of paper spray has also been enhanced by treating the paper substrate with <b>oxidation</b> <b>reagent.</b> ^ Moreover, pipette spray was developed as a very sensitive ionization cartridge by integrating the paper-based extraction function with the nano-ESI ion source for direct identification and quantitation of drugs in complex biofluids.

C=C double positions of target unsaturated lipids can be determined according to their unique fingerprint fragments derived from the PB reaction.

40|$|Since {{the first}} {{structure}} elucidation of solanidine about 70 years ago, {{there has been}} an interest to convert this aglycon to an intermediate suitable for the synthesis of steroids. A renewed interest in this conversion is stimulated by the rising prices of the present starting material diosgenine. Diosgenine is found in Costus speciosus grown in China and the availability and monopoly position of China for diosgenine is of growing concern. In the potato starch production the glycoalkaloids a -chaconine and a -solanine are first concentrated in the protein fraction. The latter can be upgraded by removal of the glycoalkaloids which ends up in a waste fraction. A procedure is available to isolate these glycoalkaloids from this waste and in principle they can be made available as alternative for diosgenine as starting material for the production of dehydropregnenolon acetate (DPA). To obtain the starting material for our research, an improved simple and effective method has been developed for the isolation of the potato glycoalkaloids, a -chaconine and a -solanine, from the residual protein waste fraction which was obtained from AVEBE. The hydrolysis of these glycoalkaloids to solanidine has been accomplished by mild acid treatmentThe conversion of solanidine to DPA was first tried by a recently published method using Hg(OAc) 2 as <b>oxidation</b> <b>reagent.</b> Although the first steps could be improved by combining the Hg(OAc) 2 oxidation with the isomerization step in a one pot synthesis, the crucial oxidation of the intermediate enamine could not be accomplishedIn the second attempt to convert solanidine to DPA the Cope and Polonovski reactions were studied and to do so it was necessary to synthesize solanidine N -oxide first. It turned out that the Cope reaction can not give the desired results because a 5 -membered planar transition state necessary for the Cope reaction is not possible in these systems. The Polonovski reaction can be carried out with Ac 2 O or (CF 3 CO) 2 O under rather extreme conditions. With Ac 2 O no reaction was observed for solanidine N -oxide or 3 -acetoxysolanidine N -oxide. Treatment of 3 -acetoxysolanidine N -oxide with (CF 3 CO) 2 O yielded a new trifluoroacylated compound but no further attempts were undertaken to convert the new trifluoroacylated compound into DPA. The third option was to open the E,F-ring system using the Von Braun reaction. Besides the desired major E-ring opened compound also the minor F-ring opened compound was isolated. Alternatives for the hazardous Von Braun reagent BrCN were investigated but without success. Calculations confirmed the unique properties of BrCN and led to the conclusion {{that this is one of}} the few reagents capable of opening ring E of solanidine. The next step was the conversion of the E-ring opened compound to DPA via the Hofmann degradation. Only Hofmann degradation of the ammonium salt containing the D 16, 17 double bond with LDA yielded the triene and the monomethylated diene which in principle can be remethylated and subjected again to Hofmann Although Hofmann degradation gives the desired triene further degradation to DPA requires several protection and deprotection steps which are not very attractive for industrial application. As a last option, the known conversion of 3 -acetoxysolanidine to spirosolane compounds followed by conversion to DPA has been investigated. DPA could be obtained starting from 3 -acetoxysolanidine in 9 reaction steps in 30 % overall yield. Extensive research was performed on finding shortcuts in this route but despite all our efforts, further shortening of the route from 3 -acetoxysolanidine via tomatidenol to DPA could not be accomplished...|$|E

Der Einsatz von O 2 als Sauerstoffquelle bzw. Oxidationsmittel ist besonders erstrebenswert. Die Erforschung der Aktivierung von O 2 an Übergangsmetallkomplexen und Untersuchung der Reaktivität der resultierenden Verbindung ist von großer Bedeutung für das Verständnis dieser Reaktionen und Mechanismen. In dieser Arbeit wurde zunächst der Komplex trans-[Ir(4 -C 5 F 4 N) (CNtBu) (PiPr 3) 2] synthetisiert, welcher mit dem 4 -C 5 F 4 N- und dem CNtBu-Liganden stabilisierende Komponenten und wertvolle analytische Sonden enthält. Ausgehend von dieser Iridium(I) -Verbindung konnte auf verschiedenen Wegen der Peroxidokomplex trans-[Ir(4 -C 5 F 4 N) (O 2) (CNtBu) (PiPr 3) 2] erhalten und umfangreich charakterisiert werden. In Gegenwart von [Fe(C 5 H 5) 2][PF 6] konnten Hinweise auf einen redoxkatalysierten Mechanismus gewonnen werden. Im nächsten Abschnitt konnte gezeigt werden, dass sich der Peroxidokomplex durch Bronstedsäuren aktivieren lässt. So wurde z. B. unter der Verwendung von Säuren wie HCl, CF 3 COOH oder HF die Bildung von H 2 O 2 erzielt. Dabei entstehen die entsprechenden Iridium(III) -Komplexe mit den koordinierten Säureanionen. In Gegenwart von HCOOH werden ein Carbonatokomplex und H 2 als Hauptprodukte gebildet und es konnten Hinweise zum Mechanismus dieser komplexen Reaktion gewonnen werden. Des Weiteren sind Lewissäuren und Elektrophile in der Lage, die metallgebundene Disauerstoffeinheit des Peroxidokomplexes zu aktivieren. Dazu wurden unter Anderem Silane und Borane eingesetzt. Im Fall von ClSiMe 3 und BClCy 2 konnten während der Reaktion Intermediate detektiert und analysiert werden. Tragen die Lewissäuren Chloratome wird die entsprechende Dichloridoiridium(III) -Verbindung gebildet. Durch Einsatz von BPh 3 konnte eine veränderte Reaktivität erreicht werden und der Ausgangskomplex trans-[Ir(4 -C 5 F 4 N) (CNtBu) (PiPr 3) 2] zurückerhalten werden. Oxygenation- and {{oxidation}} {{reactions are}} ubiquitous and {{of great importance}} to our daily life. They find application from nature to industry. The use of O 2 as an oxygen source or <b>oxidation</b> <b>reagent,</b> respectively, is particularly desirable. The research on the activation of O 2 at transition metal complexes and the investigations of the reactivity of the resulting compounds is of great significance for the understanding of these reactions and mechanisms. Herein, this work describes the synthesis of the complex trans-[Ir(4 -C 5 F 4 N) (CNtBu) (PiPr 3) 2], which incorporates stabilizing and valuable analytical elements provided by the 4 -C 5 F 4 N and CNtBu ligands. Starting from this iridium(I) compound, the peroxido complex trans-[Ir(4 -C 5 F 4 N) (O 2) (CNtBu) (PiPr 3) 2] could be synthesized using different methods. In the presence of [Fe(C 5 H 5) 2][PF 6], indications for a redox catalyzed mechanism could be provided. The next chapter shows that Bronsted acids are capable of activating the peroxido complex. With the help of acids like HCl, CF 3 COOH or HF, for example, the formation of H 2 O 2 was achieved. Thereby, the corresponding iridium(III) complexes with the coordinating anions are formed. In the presence of HCOOH, a carbonato complex and H 2 are formed as main products and ideas for the mechanism of this complex reaction were indicated. Furthermore, Lewis acids and electrophiles {{have the ability to}} activate the metal bound dioxygen moiety of the peroxido complex. Silanes and boranes were used for this purpose amongst others. In case of ClSiMe 3 and BClCy 2, intermediates of the reactions could be detected and analysed. If the Lewis acids carry chloride atoms, the corresponding dichlorido iridium(III) compounds were formed. BPh 3 enabled a different reactivity and allowed the isolation of the starting material trans-[Ir(4 C 5 F 4 N) (CNtBu) (PiPr 3) 2]...|$|E

The yield of 17 -oxo-steroids is {{not affected by}} light or pH’s between 4. 6 and 7. 0. The 17 -oxogenic steroids may be oxidized {{in the presence of}} glucose provided that additional sodium meta-periodate, equivalent in amount to or in excess of the glucose, is used for oxidation. ESTIMATION of 17 -oxogenic steroids (17 -hydroxycorticosteroids with an oxygen at the 20 position) by oxidation to 17 -oxosteroids {{has been one of the}} most useful developments in the study of cortisol metabolism for clinical purposes. The 17 -oxosteroids so formed react with alkaline m-dinitrobenzene to produce a purple chromogen which is measured colorimetrically (1).

40|$|ABSTRACT: Pilot {{tests were}} {{performed}} at the Marine Corps Logistics Base (MCLB) located in Albany, Georgia to evaluate the performance of pneumatic and hydraulic frac-turing for emplacement of in situ biological substrates/electron donors into low per-meability alluvium and Ocala Limestone (part of the Floridan aquifer system). The performance of pneumatic fracturing for emplacement of in situ chemical <b>oxidation</b> <b>reagents</b> was also evaluated. Both pneumatic and hydraulic fracturing processes have been applied in the environmental industry to enhance the secondary permeability/ hydraulic conductivity of low-permeability formations composed of silt, clay, and frac-tured rock. In theory, primarily due to viscosity differences between the fluids, pneumatic fracturing offers the advantages of increased fracture density and improved uniformity, with corresponding improved efficiency of reagent/substrate distribution. Hydraulic fracturing offers the advantage of larger fracture apertures, which allow emplacement of proppant materials. Proppant materials in turn facilitate multiple injection events over time. Based on the pilot tests, pneumatic fracturing {{appears to be a}} superior method for single stage emplacement of treatment materials in low permeability formations...|$|R
