We first offer a chemical and physical description of {{the various types of}} animal by-products and derived products not intended for humans with a view to their possible use as fuels. Animal by-products and derived products not intended for humans have an extremely high viscosity for the pressure pulverisation burners used in residential oil burning equipment. We therefore mixed diesel with animal by-products and <b>other</b> <b>derived</b> <b>products</b> not intended for humans in different percentages so as to obtain suitable viscosity. To achieve this, we carried out a study of the miscibility of animal by-products in diesel. We subsequently performed a series of combustion experiments for mixtures of diesel and animal by-products, in varying (a) percentage of by-products in diesel, (b) injection pressure and (c) excess air in combustion. We analysed the experimental combustion results based on (a) energy efficiency of combustion, (b) CO and NO x [...] emissions and (c) fossil-based greenhouse effect gases. Finally, we present the conclusions that combustion of mixed diesel with animal by-products and <b>other</b> <b>derived</b> <b>products</b> not intended for humans for use as boiler fuel low power does not require specific technology when using a conventional fuel oil burner for proper combustion. One only needs to adjust the burner factors: pressure and air flow. In the study of the combustion of mixtures, once the burner factor is adjusted, it appears that the combustion efficiency and greenhouse gas and emission gases are acceptable. The costs of removing fat through incineration or landfill range from 34 to 59 €/ton. The solution proposed in this work not only avoided the cost but also mentioned the value of residue use as fuel.|$|E

As the third largest producer of cocoa in Africa and one of the highest cocoa producer in the world, the production capacity of Nigeria was reported to have reached about 385, 000 tonnes per annum on the cultivable area of 966, 000  ha with an appreciable increase of about 215, 000 from year 2000 production level [25, 26]. The implication of this is that as the cocoa production industry is expanding, so also the cocoa pod husk (CPH) which is the by-product of cocoa processing that account for 52 to 76  % of the cocoa pod wet weight [27]. Cocoa is the principal ingredient of chocolate and <b>other</b> <b>derived</b> <b>products</b> such as cocoa liquor, cocoa butter, cocoa cake and cocoa powder, whereas the abundantly produced cocoa pod husks as waste in cocoa plantations during the extraction of cocoa beans are often discarded as of no market value.

The methodological procedures consist of {{identification of the}} most representative products of the chain - the soy in grain, the soy bran and soy oil, {{and analysis of the}} results using the Constant Market-Share (CMS) model. The sources of the growth in exportations were divided into four components: the growth of world-wide commerce, definition of the exportation guideline, destination of the exported products and the competitiveness effects. In the period studied, the soy complex as a whole diversified its commercial partners due to a decrease in the concentration of the Brazilian and paranaense exportations. However, a concentration of the soy exportation market, and the consequent increase in international competition, was verified. The reasons behind the growth of the soy complex in Brazil and in ParanÃ¡ state were competitiveness and the world-wide commerce in the period between 1990 and 1994, due to the opening of commercial barriers after 1990. The competitiveness in the period between 2000 and 2007 was due to investments in P&D. The barriers to the growth of exportations were: infrastructure, protectionism and the lack of interaction policies between the different segments of the soy complex.

40|$|Contemporary and {{emerging}} remote sensing technologies, combined with biophysical first principles and modern spatial statistics allow for novel landscapes analyses {{at a range}} of spatial and temporal scales. In the past, supervised or un-supervised classification methods {{and the development of}} indices of landscape degradation and <b>other</b> <b>derived</b> <b>products</b> based on multi-spectral imagery of various resolutions has become a standard. Biophysical indices, such as leaf area index, fraction of photosynthetically-active radiation, phytomass or canopy chemistry, can be derived from the spectral properties of satellite imagery. Indices of changes in landscape composition and structure can be measured from the thematic maps originating from remotely-sensed imagery. Additionally, 30 -year or longer time series of historical remote sensing archives (Landsat, AVHRR) allow retrospective studies of the historical range of variability and the trajectories of both landscape elements and biophysical properties. A trade-off exists between high spatial and high temporal resolution when comparing platforms. Development of new, improved sensors and analysis techniques, such as sub-pixel classifications resulting in the development of continuous fields for formerly discrete classes, has reduced this trade-off. High spectral resolution and multiple view angles even enhance the potential for accurate retrieval of variables such as Albedo and chlorophyll concentration. Thus, powerful monitoring tools for land use/cover change detection are arising from such analyses. They can lead to an improved understanding of landscape states and processes. Finally, this evolution allows for mapping and monitoring of new landscape features that were not much used to date...|$|E

40|$|Objective: There {{is concern}} {{about the extent to}} which {{consumers}} will accept genetically modified (GM) foods in China. Existing studies are mostly inconsistent and sometimes confusing. Although China produced and consumed the biggest amount of GM crops and <b>other</b> <b>derived</b> <b>products,</b> there were only limited studies about Chinese public acceptance for GM foods. This review was aimed to explore the public acceptance for GM food in China and reasons for acceptance or against for GM food. Methods: Literature were retrieved from Google Scholar, Pubmed and CNKI using key words of "genetically modified food" (OR "GM food" OR "GMO Food" OR "GM foods") combined with "acceptance" (OR “attitude” OR “willingness to buy”). Consumers' knowledge and understanding about GM food, attitudes and acceptance for GM food as well as factors or reasons associated with their attitudes or acceptance were synthesized. Result: Of 1000 literature retrieved from the specified data sources, 20 were eligible to be included in this study. Generally, knowledge and understanding of GM food was limited among Chinese consumers. However, acceptance for GM food were generally positive among the Chinese consumers, around 60 %- 80 % according to the studies included in this review. Factors associated with acceptance for GM food included price of GM food, respondents' demographics, government attitudes and media coverage. Conclusion: The Chinese government should better communicate the risk and benefits associated GM food to improve acceptance of GM food. Communication should target subgroups of consumers to improve their knowledge and perceived benefits of GM food. Labeling of GM food should also be implemented in China to help the consumers to make a better choice. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|E
