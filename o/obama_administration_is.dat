25|$|The Department of Justice later {{narrowed the}} charges against Minister King Shabazz and {{dismissed}} {{the charges against}} the New Black Panther Party and Jerry Jackson. The decision to dismiss the charges has led to accusations that the Department of Justice under the <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> <b>is</b> biased against white victims and unwilling to prosecute minorities for civil rights violations. These charges have been most notably made by J. Christian Adams, who in May 2010 resigned his post in the Department of Justice in protest over the Obama administration's perceived mishandling of the case, and by his former supervisor Christopher Coates.|$|E
2500|$|Lieutenant General Michael R. Moeller of the United States Air Force {{served for}} two years as the U.S. Security Coordinator from October 2010 to October 2012. According to his {{official}} military biography, immediately prior to this appointment, Moeller served as Director for Strategy, Plans and Policy for Headquarters U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM). General Moeller {{has served as a}} pilot in operations Desert Storm, Enduring Freedom, and Iraqi Freedom. Since this was designated a [...] "position of importance and responsibility" [...] under United States law (10 USC 601), the incumbent holds the rank of Lieutenant General. Moeller's appointment by the <b>Obama</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>is</b> reported to be an effort to increase coordination between CENTCOM and the USSC program. Additionally, since taking over for Dayton, Lt. Gen. Moeller has kept a low profile, which has been attributed to his desire to smooth relations with the PA, who were quite displeased with his predecessor. On 15 May 2012, Moeller was nominated by the President for reappointment to the grade of Lieutenant General and assignment to a different [...] "position of importance and responsibility". As of 20 December 2012, General Moeller is serving as Deputy Chief of Staff for Strategic Plans and Programs at Headquarters of the U.S. Air Force.|$|E

Armstrong appointed Saul Hansell, a technology and finance reporter of The New York Times to run a journalism and engineering system for AOL called Seed, based on the concept that editors can make decisions on what to write about by compiling data and algorithms from the leading search engines like Google and social network sites like Facebook. By January 2011, Seed had a staff of 25 and had taken {{an active role in}} writing both news stories and compiling videos for AOL sites. Patch remains a productive news source, and as of January 2011 it reportedly cost AOL approximately 30 million dollars a quarter to run. In a 2011 interview, Armstrong claimed that Patch was responsible for the [...] "largest investment in local communities outside of what the <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> <b>is</b> doing". In 2010, Armstrong launched AOL's [...] "Monster Help Day", which commits AOL employees worldwide to work for free for a day to raise money for charity. By the time of the 6th Annual Help Day in 2015, the scheme had 85 projects running worldwide, with over 50,000 work hours donated.|$|E

2500|$|The Office of Management and Budget {{reported}} that $54 billion in [...] "improper payments" [...] {{were made to}} Medicare ($24B), Medicaid ($18B) and Medicaid Advantage ($12B) during FY 2009. This was 9.4% of the $573 billion spent in these categories. The Government Accountability Office lists Medicare as a [...] "high-risk" [...] government program due to its vulnerability to improper payments. [...] Fewer than 5% of Medicare claims are audited. [...] Medicare fraud accounts for an estimated $60 billion in Medicare payments each year, and [...] "has become one of, if not the most profitable, crimes in America." [...] Criminals set up phony companies, then invoice Medicare for fraudulent services provided to valid Medicare patients who never receive the services. These costs appear on the Medicare statements provided to Medicare card holders. The program pays out over $430 billion per year via over 1 billion claims, making enforcement challenging. Its enforcement budget is [...] "extremely limited" [...] according to one Medicare official. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in an interview: [...] "Clearly more auditing {{needs to be done}} {{and it needs to be}} done in real time." [...] The <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> <b>is</b> providing Medicare with an additional $200 million to fight fraud as part of its stimulus package, and billions of dollars to computerize medical records and upgrade networks, which should assist Medicare in identifying fraudulent claims.|$|E
2500|$|A direct suit of a {{state by}} the federal {{government}} is rare, and the action held possible political consequences for the 2010 U.S. midterm elections as well. [...] It was also seen as a preemptive measure to discourage other states considering similar laws from moving forward with them. [...] Immediate reaction to the Justice Department's decision was highly split, with liberal groups hailing it but with Governor Brewer calling it [...] "nothing more than a massive waste of taxpayer funds." [...] Senators Kyl and McCain released a joint statement noting that [...] "the American people must wonder whether the <b>Obama</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>is</b> really committed to securing the border when it sues a state that is simply trying to protect its people by enforcing immigration law." [...] Congressman Darrell Issa, one of nineteen Republicans to sign a letter criticizing the suit on the day it was announced, said [...] "For President Obama to stand in the way {{of a state}} which has taken action to stand up for its citizens against the daily threat of violence and fear is disgraceful and a betrayal of his Constitutional obligation to protect our citizens." [...] The federal action also led to a surge in contributions to the governor's defense fund for the law; by July 8, total donations were over $500,000, with the large majority of them being for $100 or less and coming from around the nation.|$|E
2500|$|... – US President Barack Obama {{said he was}} [...] "deeply concerned" [...] by the violence, while US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged restraint. On April 30, 2011, Obama {{spoke to}} the Bahraini king by phone and {{reportedly}} {{told him that the}} U.S. position is that Manama must make political reforms and respect the [...] "universal rights" [...] of the Bahraini people. Some media outlets reported on July 21, 2011, that the <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> <b>is</b> strongly considering closing its naval base in Bahrain, which hosts the U.S. Fifth Fleet, in favor of a new base in the Persian Gulf {{as a result of the}} crackdown and ongoing instability. The Australian quoted anonymous U.S. politicians as believing the continuing presence of the U.S. Navy in the archipelago was seen as [...] "tacit support" [...] for the regime, and that the U.S. government should act to dispel this popular impression by moving the base out of Bahrain. Washington swiftly denied these allegations, with both U.S. Navy and State Department officials calling the reports inaccurate. After the alleged beating of Nabeel Rajab, a leading human rights activist, in Manama by security forces, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland called on Bahraini authorities, who denied culpability and said Rajab was rushed to hospital by police after being found injured in the street, to investigate the incident. [...] "While the facts surrounding the violence that transpired remain in dispute, we strongly urge the Government of Bahrain to undertake a full investigation to determine if excessive force was employed by police," [...] said Nuland, who also called on [...] "all demonstrators to refrain from acts of violence and ... police and security forces also to avoid excessive use of force".|$|E
