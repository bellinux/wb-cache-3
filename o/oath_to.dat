5|$|In Ascension, it is {{revealed}} that because Kratos renounced Ares, it broke his blood <b>oath</b> <b>to</b> the god and as such, Kratos was imprisoned and tortured {{by the three}} Furies. He was helped by the oath keeper Orkos and eventually overcame and killed the Furies. In order to completely be free of Ares' oath, Kratos was forced to kill Orkos, who begged Kratos to do so. Although free of his <b>oath</b> <b>to</b> the god, he was flooded with memories of killing his family. He then vowed to serve the other gods {{in order to receive}} forgiveness and relief from the nightmares of his past deeds, but he was openly defiant.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins with}} Kratos, who is imprisoned, chained, and tormented by the Furies for {{breaking}} his blood <b>oath</b> <b>to</b> Ares. The Fury Megaera tortures Kratos, but {{he manages to}} break free. Chasing her through the prison, he discovers that the prison itself is Aegaeon the Hecatonchires, the first traitor of the Furies who had broken a blood <b>oath</b> <b>to</b> Zeus; he was turned into the Prison of the Damned as punishment. Overcoming an illusion created by the Fury Tisiphone and her familiar Daemon, Kratos finds and kills Megaera, retrieving the Amulet of Uroborus, which the Furies had confiscated from {{him when he was}} imprisoned.|$|E

5|$|Aegaeon– Featured in Ascension, Aegaeon the Hecatonchires had pledged a blood <b>oath</b> <b>to</b> Zeus, {{but later}} betrayed the god. The first {{victim of the}} Furies, they {{captured}} and tortured the multi-armed creature. Instead of killing him, the Furies turned him to stone, making him the giant Prison of the Damned and becoming a symbol to all who may think of breaking a blood <b>oath</b> <b>to</b> a god. As Kratos attempted to escape the prison, Megaera used her parasitic insects to bring Aegaeon to life and control him as his many arms mutated into monstrous forms and began to attack the Spartan. Fending off two of its parasite-controlled arms, Megaera then infected Aegaeon's head, which attacked Kratos, but the Spartan outsmarted and killed Megaera; this also caused Aegaeon to die, freeing him from his suffering.|$|E

During this operation he encountered Harald near Thurso and captured him. Harald was freed {{in return for}} a ransom in gold and by giving his <b>oath</b> <b>to</b> Eystein. Eystein then went on to raid the coasts of Scotland and England.|$|E

His wife Isabella died after giving birth to a son, Conrad, in May 1228.

5|$|Leo had {{meanwhile}} united the Armenian Church in Cilicia with Rome {{and acknowledged}} the suzerainty of the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry VI. The emperor's envoy, Conrad of Wittelsbach, Archbishop of Mainz, was present when Leo was crowned the first king of Armenian Cilicia on 6January 1198. Before long, Conrad went to Antioch and persuaded Bohemond and his barons to swear an <b>oath</b> <b>to</b> accept Raymund-Roupen's right to inherit Antioch.|$|E
5|$|The Scribe of Hecatonchires– The first mortal {{imprisoned by}} the Furies for {{breaking}} a blood <b>oath</b> <b>to</b> a god. To keep his sanity, he wrote meticulous {{records of the}} sisters and their schemes, which Kratos found throughout the prison. He informed Kratos that originally, although the Furies were cruel, they were fair, but became ruthless on account of Ares. The character was voiced by Robin Atkin Downes in Ascension.|$|E

5|$|To ease tensions, Grant {{signed the}} Amnesty Act of 1872 on May 23, 1872 that gave amnesty to former Confederates. This act allowed most former Confederates, who {{before the war}} had taken an <b>oath</b> <b>to</b> uphold the Constitution of the United States, to hold elected public office. Only 500 former Confederates {{remained}} unpardonable and therefore forbidden to hold elected public office.|$|E

While in Toronto he studied law with General John C. Breckinridge, a former Vice President of the United States. Once U.S. President Andrew Johnson {{declared}} a pardon for most former Confederates, Hines went back to Detroit on July 20, 1865, to sign a loyalty <b>oath</b> <b>to</b> the United States. However, knowing that Union officials in Kentucky would consider him an exception to the pardon, he remained in Canada until May 1866.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Gilbert de Greenlaw, Bishop of Aberdeen, in 1421, Lichton was chosen as his successor, and was {{translated}} to the diocese of Aberdeen in early April 1422, on the authority of Pope Martin V. Pope Martin delegated authority to Robert de Cardeny, Bishop of Dunkeld, and William Stephen, Bishop of Dunblane, {{in order to take}} Lichton's <b>oath</b> <b>to</b> the Papal see without forcing him to travel to Rome. It is of note that Lichton had already been in possession of the prebend of Kinkell in the Aberdeen diocese, a former possession of the Knights Hospitaller but attached to Aberdeen Cathedral by Lichton's time.|$|E

5|$|Despite being {{appointed}} by agreement of national governments acting together, the members were to {{pledge not to}} represent their national interest, but rather took an <b>oath</b> <b>to</b> defend the general interests of the Community as a whole. Their independence was aided by members being barred from having any occupation outside the Authority or having any business interests (paid or unpaid) during their tenure and for three years after they left office. To further ensure impartiality, {{one third of the}} membership was to be renewed every two years (article 10).|$|E
5|$|Despite {{presiding}} over the conversions of Muslims in his wife's Castilian lands, Ferdinand II did not extend the conversions to his Aragonese subject. Kings of Aragon, including Ferdinand, were required {{to swear an oath}} of coronation to not forcibly convert their Muslim subjects. He repeated the same <b>oath</b> <b>to</b> his Cortes (assembly of estates) in 1510, and throughout his life he was unwilling to break it. Ferdinand died in 1516, and was succeeded by his grandson Charles V, who also swore the same oath at his coronation.|$|E

Henry was also able to persuade Hugh Bigod, the late King's royal steward, to swear that the King had changed his mind about the succession on his deathbed, nominating Stephen instead. Stephen's coronation was held a week later at Westminster Abbey on 22 December.|$|E
5|$|In March 978, King Edward {{was assassinated}} at Corfe Castle, {{possibly}} at the instigation of his stepmother, and Æthelred the Unready became king.

When the young king took the usual <b>oath</b> <b>to</b> govern well, Dunstan addressed him in solemn warning. He criticised the violent act whereby he became king and prophesied the misfortunes that were shortly to fall on the kingdom, but Dunstan's influence at court was ended. Dunstan retired to Canterbury, to teach at the cathedral school.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the oath, the monarch may take {{what is known as}} the Accession Declaration if he or she has not yet made it. This declaration was first required by the Bill of Rights of 1689 and is required to be taken at either the first meeting of the parliament after a new monarch's accession (i.e. during the State Opening of Parliament) or at his or her coronation. The monarch additionally swears a separate <b>oath</b> <b>to</b> preserve Presbyterian church government in the Church of Scotland and this oath is taken before the coronation.|$|E
