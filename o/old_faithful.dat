5|$|The {{park service}} gave {{priority}} {{to life and}} property {{in their efforts to}} suppress the fires. Of the more than 1,000 structures located in the park, only 67 were destroyed. There were 400 structures in the <b>Old</b> <b>Faithful</b> complex and only 19 of these were destroyed, 12 of which were concessionaire housing units and relatively inexpensive to replace. Major tourist locations in the park such as the one at <b>Old</b> <b>Faithful</b> were heavily staffed by fire fighting crews and equipment, especially at times of immediate danger. Fire fighters used a variety of methods to establish safe zones in and near these complexes, yet every single visitor complex was evacuated by non-critical personnel at least once during the fires.|$|E
5|$|Tectonics-based {{events will}} {{continue}} to occur well into {{the future and the}} surface will be steadily reshaped by tectonic uplift, extrusions, and erosion. Mount Vesuvius can be expected to erupt about 40 times over the next 1,000 years. During the same period, about five to seven earthquakes of magnitude 8 or greater should occur along the San Andreas Fault, while about 50 magnitude 9 events may be expected worldwide. Mauna Loa should experience about 200 eruptions over the next 1,000 years, and the <b>Old</b> <b>Faithful</b> Geyser will likely cease to operate. The Niagara Falls {{will continue to}} retreat upstream, reaching Buffalo in about 30,00050,000 years.|$|E
5|$|The National Park Service {{maintains}} 9 visitor {{centers and}} museums and {{is responsible for}} maintenance of historical structures {{and many of the}} other 2,000 buildings. These structures include National Historical Landmarks such as the <b>Old</b> <b>Faithful</b> Inn built from 1903 to 1904 and the entire Fort Yellowstone – Mammoth Hot Springs Historic District. An historical and educational tour is available at Fort Yellowstone which details the history of the National Park Service and the development of the park. Campfire programs, guided walks and other interpretive presentations are available at numerous locations in the summer, and on a limited basis during other seasons.|$|E
50|$|The next attempt {{involves}} Tweety {{hiding in}} <b>Old</b> <b>Faithful's</b> geyser, which would erupt exactly when the clock below turns to 12:00. He sets {{the clock to}} 12:30 and jumps in, while Tweety sets the clock to 12:00, the time it erupts, forcing the cat upward.|$|R

5|$|There are {{two types}} of geysers: {{fountain}} geysers which erupt from pools of water, typically in a series of intense, even violent, bursts; and cone geysers which erupt from cones or mounds of siliceous sinter (including geyserite), usually in steady jets that last anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes. <b>Old</b> <b>Faithful,</b> perhaps the best-known geyser at Yellowstone National Park, {{is an example of a}} cone geyser. Grand Geyser, the tallest predictable geyser on earth, (although Geysir in Iceland is taller, it is not predictable), also at Yellowstone National Park, is an example of a fountain geyser.|$|E
5|$|Lack of {{understanding}} of wildfire management by the media led to some sensationalist reporting and inaccuracies. Some news agencies gave the impression {{that most of the}} park was being destroyed. On August 30, an ABC News interview with Stanley Mott, apparently a tourist, incorrectly identified him as the Director of the National Park Service (William Mott). In another story, The New York Times stated that the Park Service policy was to allow natural fires to burn themselves out, whereas that of the U.S. Forest Service was to suppress all such fires—a mischaracterization of the policies of both agencies. The media also had some difficulty distinguishing between these two completely separate agencies. Sources quoted by The Washington Post, USA Today, and the Chicago Tribune later stated that comments attributed to them were fabricated, and one source commented that a September 8, 1988 report by the Chicago Tribune had more errors than facts. On the same day, The Washington Post associated the smoke and presence of military vehicles and helicopters overhead with the 1968 events in Da Nang, Vietnam, giving the impression of catastrophe. The fires had been very active in late July. In early August, fire managers reached a conclusion that the fires would not likely expand much further, {{due to a lack of}} fuel, and the Director of the National Park Service declared on August 11 that the fires were contained. When this optimistic announcement was followed by Black Saturday on August 20, and the fire that threatened the <b>Old</b> <b>Faithful</b> complex in early September, the media were again highly critical of the park service and their policies.|$|E
25|$|The hills {{surrounding}} <b>Old</b> <b>Faithful</b> and the Upper Geyser Basin are {{reminders of}} Quaternary rhyolitic lava flows. These flows, occurring {{long after the}} catastrophic eruption of 640,000 years ago, flowed across the landscape like stiff mounds of bread dough due to their high silica content.|$|E

25|$|Early {{visitors}} {{would arrive}} at West Thumb via stagecoach from the <b>Old</b> <b>Faithful</b> area. They {{had a choice}} of continuing on the stagecoach or boarding the steamship Zillah to continue the journey by water to Lake Hotel. The boat dock was located near {{the south end of}} the geyser basin near Lakeside Spring.|$|E
25|$|Signs of {{the forces}} of erosion can be seen everywhere, from runoff {{channels}} carved across the sinter in the geyser basins to the drainage created by the Firehole River. Mountain building is evident on the drive south of <b>Old</b> <b>Faithful,</b> toward Craig Pass. Here the Rocky Mountains reach a height of 8,262 feet (2,518 m), dividing the country into two distinct watersheds.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the delays}} and {{setbacks}} Jackson returned with conclusive photographic {{evidence of the}} various western landmarks that had previously seemed only a fantastic myth: the Grand Tetons, <b>Old</b> <b>Faithful</b> {{and the rest of}} the Yellowstone region, Colorado's Rockies and the Mount of the Holy Cross, and the uncooperative Ute Indians. Jackson's photographs of Yellowstone helped convince the U.S. Congress to make it the first national park in March 1872.|$|E

25|$|The tallest active geyser in {{the world}} is Steamboat Geyser and it is located in Norris Basin. Unlike the {{slightly}} smaller but much more famous <b>Old</b> <b>Faithful</b> Geyser located in Upper Geyser Basin, Steamboat has an erratic and lengthy timetable between major eruptions. During major eruptions, which may be separated by intervals of more than a year (the longest recorded span between major eruptions was 50 years), Steamboat erupts over 300 feet (90 m) into the air. Steamboat does not lie dormant between eruptions, instead displaying minor eruptions of approximately 40 feet (12 m).|$|E
25|$|Geysers: Geysers such as <b>Old</b> <b>Faithful</b> are {{a type of}} {{geothermal}} {{feature that}} periodically erupt scalding hot water. Increased pressure exerted by the enormous weight of the overlying rock and water prevents deeper water from boiling. As the hot water rises it is under less pressure and steam bubbles form. They, in turn, expand on their ascent until the bubbles are too big and numerous to pass freely through constrictions. At a critical point the confined bubbles actually lift the water above, causing the geyser to splash or overflow. This decreases {{the pressure of the}} system and violent boiling results. Large quantities of water flash into tremendous amounts of steam that force a jet of water out of the vent: an eruption begins. Water (and heat) is expelled faster than the geyser’s recharge rate, gradually decreasing the system’s pressure and eventually ending the eruption.|$|E
500|$|Between September 5 and 7, a dry front pushed flames {{along the}} {{southern}} section of the North Fork fire towards the large <b>Old</b> <b>Faithful</b> visitor complex adjacent to the Upper Geyser Basin. All non-emergency personnel were ordered to be evacuated; however, political issues influenced National Park Service management directives and the complex was not completely closed to incoming tourists, with some visitors still arriving at <b>Old</b> <b>Faithful</b> not long before the intense fire hit by mid afternoon. An all out aerial bombardment with air tankers dropping fire retardant failed. Firefighters concentrated on structure protection, especially those of historical significance such as the <b>Old</b> <b>Faithful</b> Inn, using fire engines and portable water pumping systems to keep the roofs and other surfaces of the structures wet. 1,200 firefighters including 120 military personnel dug fire lines and cleared away brush near structures. Winds crested up to [...] as the fire approached from the west.|$|E
60|$|The prince's counselors {{advised him}} to do no such thing. One of them in particular, a certain Sir Davy Hall, who was an <b>old</b> and <b>faithful</b> officer in the prince's service, urged him to pay no {{attention}} to Queen Margaret's taunts.|$|R

500|$|Another {{well known}} {{location}} in Yellowstone, the <b>Old</b> <b>Faithful</b> geyser, produces horizontal steam devils. [...] In all, Yellowstone probably {{has the most}} frequent occurrences of accessible steam devils anywhere. [...] Several steam devils are produced every hour at the most productive locations.

500|$|Preceding Grauman's Chinese Theater in Hollywood, the 5th Avenue Theatre [...] "has {{been called}} {{the largest and most}} {{authentic}} example of traditional Chinese timber architecture and decoration outside of Asia." [...] In addition, its association with architect Robert Reamer, whose other notable works include the nationally known <b>Old</b> <b>Faithful</b> Inn in Yellowstone National Park, as well as many important buildings in the Art Deco style add to its significance. The Fifth Avenue Theatre was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on November 28, 1978.|$|E
500|$|The {{risks of}} her {{profession}} were illustrated when on October 1833 she barely avoided {{being killed by}} a landslide that buried her black-and-white terrier, Tray, her constant companion when she went collecting. She wrote to a friend, Charlotte Murchison, in November of that year: [...] "Perhaps you will laugh when I say that {{the death of my}} <b>old</b> <b>faithful</b> dog has quite upset me, the cliff that fell upon him and killed him in a moment before my eyes, and close to my feet ... it was but a moment between me and the same fate." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{most famous}} geyser in the park, {{and perhaps the}} world, is <b>Old</b> <b>Faithful</b> geyser, located in Upper Geyser Basin. Castle Geyser, Lion Geyser and Beehive Geyser {{are in the same}} basin. The park {{contains}} the largest active geyser in the world—Steamboat Geyser in the Norris Geyser Basin. A study that was completed in 2011 found that at least 1283 geysers have erupted in Yellowstone. [...] Of these, an average of 465 are active in a given year. [...] Yellowstone contains at least 10,000 geothermal features altogether. Half the geothermal features and two-thirds of the world's geysers are concentrated in Yellowstone.|$|E
500|$|Crown Fountain, Trevi Fountain, and Buckingham Fountain, as well {{as natural}} water {{features}} such as <b>Old</b> <b>Faithful,</b> are examples of the ability of water to attract people and hold their attention. Crown Fountain has more interactivity than other Chicago fountains, such as Buckingham Fountain and Lorado Taft's Fountain of the Great Lakes and Fountain of Time [...] (all but the last are in Grant Park). [...] These other Chicago fountains are traditional in that they discourage viewer touching; Buckingham Fountain {{is surrounded by a}} fence, and Taft's fountains are surrounded by moats. In contrast, Crown Fountain provides an open invitation to play in the fountain's water.|$|E
500|$|Yellowstone National Park is a {{national}} park located in the U.S. states of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho. [...] It was established by the U.S.Congress and {{signed into law by}} President Ulysses S. Grant on March 1, 1872. Yellowstone was the first National Park in the U.S. and is also widely held to be the first national park in the world. The park is known for its wildlife and its many geothermal features, especially <b>Old</b> <b>Faithful</b> geyser, one of its most popular features. It has many types of ecosystems, but the subalpine forest is the most abundant. It is part of the South Central Rockies forests ecoregion.|$|E
