40|$|In the {{analysis}} of orthogonal cutting process using FE simulations, predictions are greatly influenced by two major factors; a) flow stress characteristics of work material at cutting regimes and b) friction characteristics mainly at the chip-tool interface. The influence of work material flow stress upon FE simulations may be less or even none {{when there is a}} constitutive model for work material that is obtained empirically from high-strain rate and temperature deformation tests. However, the difficulty arises when one needs to implement accurate friction models for cutting simulations using a particular FE formulation. In this study, a thermo-mechanical updated Lagrangian finite element formulation is used to simulate continuous chip formation process in orthogonal cutting <b>of</b> low carbon <b>free-cutting</b> <b>steel.</b> The effects <b>of</b> using various chip-tool interface friction models on the simulations are investigated. Experimentally measured stress distributions on the tool rake face are utilized in conjunction with metal cutting theory to develop several friction models and the evaluation of the results for the friction models is carried out. The results depict that the use of various chip-tool interface friction models has at most influence in predicting chip geometry, forces, stresses on the tool and temperature at the chip-tool interface and the predicts are best when using variable shear friction model at the chip-tool interface. Predictions presented in this work also justify that the FE simulation technique used for orthogonal cutting process is an accurate and viable analysis as long as flow stress behavior of the work material obtained realistically and friction at the chip-tool interface is modeled correctly.

Low carbon <b>free-cutting</b> <b>steels</b> {{are widely}} used for parts and components subject to moderate strength levels and relatively low shock loading, with machinability being the most important factor. Examples are hydraulic valves, keys, contact boards and other parts requiring rapid metal removal. These materials are especially designed for high machinability, that is, reduced tool-chip contact length, low coefficient of friction between the tool and the chip or the workpiece, production of easy handled chips, low cutting forces and power consumption, thereby providing long tool lives and/or high productivity by using high cutting speeds. Elements like Mn, P, S and Pb are generally present in their composition ensuring improved machinability.

40|$|Abstract. Free-cutting {{phosphor}} bronze alloy (ASTM C 54400) {{was used as}} a material for automotive parts and industrial valve parts for its high strength, machinability and excellent corrosion resistance.

After annealing, the tensile strength of the alloy decreased with increasing annealing time owing to the occurrence of recrystallization and grain growth. In the cast and swaged alloy produced at casting speed of 120 m/min, the grain growth occurred rapidly. In contrast, in the alloy produced at the casting speed of 80 m/min, the grains growth rate was low.

40|$|DoctorThe {{evolution}} of particles during solidification of steels was investigated by experiments and microsegregation calculations employing simple microsegregation models with a help of computing software such as ThermoClac and FactSage {{for the better}} control and utilization of inclusions and precipitates. In order to elucidate the formation of large Nb-Ti carbonitride particles which cause defects in final steel products such as linepipes or shipbuilding plates, the formation of Nb-Ti carbonitride particles during solidification was investigated employing unidirectional solidification technique with a constant cooling rate (8 ？aC/min) {{and the effects of}} microsegregation was estimated using simple microsegregation models. During unidirectional solidification, most (Nb,Ti) (C,N) particles were formed in the interdendritic region due to microsegregation and their size and morphologies were affected by the steel composition. With increasing alloying elements such as Ti, Nb, C, and N, the size of carbonitride particles increased. Type II Cubic Ti-rich (Nb,Ti) (C,N) particles were heterogeneously nucleated on the surface of oxide inclusions at earlier stage of solidification than Nb-rich (Nb,Ti) (C,N) particles. Type III Plate- and type IV fishbone-like Nb-rich (Nb,Ti) (C,N) particles were formed at the final stage of solidification. Unintended formation of type I dendritic Nb-rich (Nb,Ti) (C,N) particles occurred due to solidification of the remaining liquid steel during quenching stage. Under the solidification condition of the present study, modified Scheil model considering complete diffusion of interstitial elements such as C and N was well applicable to simulate microsegregation and formation of (Nb,Ti) (C,N) in the interdendritic liquid. Considering macrosegregation in the slab center, with increasing macrosegregation degree, size of (Nb,Ti) (C,N) increased. Especially, size of Nb-rich (Nb,Ti) (C,N) particle sharply increased when the macrosegregation degree exceeded a certain value. In order to utilize oxysulfide inclusions more efficiently in the <b>free-cutting</b> <b>steels,</b> phase equilibria <b>of</b> the MnO-SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 -MnS quaternary system in the temperature range of 1185 to 1500 ？XC was measured and behavior of oxysulfide inclusions which consist of the quaternary system was investigated in the unidirectionally solidified steel. In the MnO-MnS system, the eutectic temperature and composition of the MnO-MnS system were also determined to be 1256 ∂ 3 ？XC and 64 ∂ 1 mass% MnS. In the MnO-SiO 2 -MnS system, ternary compound ¨A〃(67. 3 mass% MnO- 23. 4 mass% SiO 2 - 9. 3 mass% MnS) which melted incongruently at a temperature between 1280 and 1300 ？XC and ternary compound ¨B〃(74. 4 mass% MnO- 22. 0 mass% SiO 2 - 3. 6 mass% MnS) which melted incongruently at a temperature between 1300 ？XC and 1315 ？XC and decomposed into MnO, Mn 2 SiO 4 and the ternary compound ¨A〃 were observed. Based on the experimental results, polythermal projection of the MnO-SiO 2 -MnS system below 1500 ？XC was estimated. In the MnO-SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 -MnS system, the MnS solubility is strongly affected by the Al 2 O 3 content and also the MnO/SiO 2 ratio. It increased as increasing MnO/SiO 2 ratio at a constant Al 2 O 3 content and decreased as increasing the Al 2 O 3 content at a constant MnO/SiO 2 ratio. In addition, depending on the Al 2 O 3 content and the MnO/SiO 2 ration, the liquid phase is possibly saturated with not only MnS but also other solid oxide phases. In the aspect of inclusions utilization for <b>free-cutting</b> <b>steel,</b> it might have an advantage to decrease Al 2 O 3 content and increase MnO/SiO 2 ratio. Thermodynamic calculation of the MnO-SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 -MnS system using FactSage with newly developed database by Kang and Pelton shows a good agreement with the results of present study. Therefore, it was confidently used for the calculation of phase equilibria in the oxysulfide inclusion during solidification steels. The behavior of oxysulfide inclusions was investigated employing unidirectional solidification technique and the effect of microsegregation was estimated using Scheil model with a help of thermodynamic calculation software (FactSage). The oxysulfide inclusions which were formed in the liquid before solidification had high content of Al and they were dispersed uniformly in the intradendritic region after solidification. With increasing solid fraction, Al 2 O 3 /(SiO 2 +Al 2 O 3) ratio in the inclusions gradually decreased. According to the Scheil calculation, soluble Al in molten steel was almost consumed when the solid fraction exceeded about 0. 5 thereby newly precipitated inclusions during solidification or after solidification had low Al content. It shows a good agreement with the experimental results. Al 2 O 3 /(SiO 2 +Al 2 O 3) ratio in the inclusions which were located on the interdendritic region was much lower than the primary inclusions. In addition, oxysulfide inclusions which were precipitated after solidification had also low value of Al 2 O 3 /(SiO 2 +Al 2 O 3) ratio...|$|R

The resulting microstructure in the propagating crack vicinity was markedly influenced by this fracture. In the crack vicinity, a noticeable refinement of grains was observed due to the stress-induced recrystallization and occurrence of deformation zones that were pronounced by the rolled-out and stretched sulphides.

Unlike common construction AA 6082 alloy, the free machining AA 6262 and AA 6023 aluminium alloys show a significant decrease in notch impact strength KU at elevated temperatures.

40|$|DoctorTitanium {{is added}} in many grade steels as an {{alloying}} element to improve mechanical properties via the grain refinement during hot rolling. Also, Ti {{is an important}} alloying element in stainless steels to stabilize C and N, and hence to improve the inter-granular corrosion resistance of the weld. Meanwhile, Ti alloyed steels can have severe nozzle clogging problems, which are detrimental to slab surface quality. The selenium added steels have been concerned to replace the conventionally lead added machinability steels because of environmental friendliness. Since the yield of Se addition into liquid steel is quite low due to its high vapor pressure at steelmaking temperatures, the improvement of Se yield becomes essential for its successful application to plant. In this thesis, in order to decrease the deleterious inclusions resulting in the nozzle clogging and increase the Ti yield, the effect of Ti addition between melt and refractory will be investigated. In case of Se, thermodynamics {{on the behavior of}} selenium based on dissolution reactions in liquid iron as well as selenium-containing slags will be investigated as well. In chapter II, the thermodynamic role of Ti in steels and the effect of Ca and Ti addition to the molten stainless steel deoxidized with Al on the formation of (Al 2 O 3 -xMgO) spinel inclusions were investigated. High melting point inclusions such as spinel(Al 2 O 3 -xMgO) are known to promote clogging of the SEN nozzle in a continuous caster mold. In particular, Ti alloyed steels can have severe nozzle clogging problems, which are detrimental to slab surface quality. The sequence of Ca and Ti additions after Al deoxidation was also investigated. The inclusion chemistry and morphology according to the order of Ca and Ti are discussed from the standpoint of spinel formation. The thermodynamic interaction parameter of Mg with respect to the Ti alloying element was determined. The element of Ti in steels could contribute to enhancing the spinel formation, because Ti accelerates Mg dissolution from the MgO containing refractory walls or slags due to its high thermodynamic affinity for Mg. Even though Ti induces also Ca dissolution from the CaO containing refractory walls or slags owing to its thermodynamic affinity for Ca, dissolved Ca plays a role in favoring the formation of calcium aluminate inclusions, which are more stable thermodynamically in an Al deoxized steel. The inclusion content of steel samples was analyzed to better understand fundamentals of (Al 2 O 3 -xMgO) spinel inclusion formation. The optimum processing conditions for Ca treatment and Ti addition in austenitic stainless steel melts to achieve the minimized spinel formation and the maximized Ti alloying yield is discussed. In chapter III, the standard free energy change of the dissolution reaction of Se vapor in liquid iron at steelmaking temperatures was determined. The Henrian activity constant of Se in Fe-Se system at 1873 K was also assessed. The self interaction parameter of Se was obtained as - 0. 045 by assuming the regular solution model in Fe-Se system using the values of the Gibbs free energy and the Herian constant. The interaction parameters between Se and second element i such as O, Cr, Ni, Mn, N, Mo, Si, Al, S, Bi and Te were also determined. The solute elements of O, Ni, Cr and Mn significantly increase the selenium solubility in liquid iron. The determined interaction parameters between Se and second elements in liquid iron at 1873 K will be addressed in terms of the economical and feasible ways of Se addition as well as the improvement of machinability owing to MnSe formation during the solidification stage. Using these values of interaction parameters, the further studies employing the refining slags and melt equilibrium reaction system need to be done to address a feasible processing way to produce an environmentally friendly <b>free-cutting</b> <b>steels.</b> However, there has not been much research on these slags system for optimization of the behavior of Se. Therefore, it is necessary to develop the processing methods to increase Se yield in steels enough to complete against the production cost of Pb containing steel grade. In order to increase the Se yield, the slag system of CaO-SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 -MgO relevant to refining Se-containing steels such as free cutting steel is thermodynamically assessed at 1873 K. The distribution ratio of Se has been determined in slag/melt system. Selenium capacity due to the basicity and oxygen potential was also researched. Besides, the effect of substitution of each slag component on the selenium capacity and the relationship between optical basicity and selenium capacity were researched as well. This thermodynamic assessment can be performed to understand the behavior of Se in slag/metal system and get the data of optimization for these slag systems. In chapter IV, based on the results from chapter II and III, this thesis suggested an application method of the present results to actual refining processes, in order to decrease the deleterious inclusions such as spinel(Al 2 O 3 -xMgO) as well as increase Se contents in steel melt...|$|R

Findings: The properties of semi-manufactures, analyses of machining tests results and large economic advantages confirm that the alternative procedure (press quenching methodcan be used for preparation <b>of</b> bars from <b>free-cutting</b> aluminium alloys. Besides better economy in terms of energy consumption, the alternative procedure is also ecologically more acceptable. Research limitations/implications: The restrictions resulting from legislation force us to develop new materials and alternative technologies. This provides a technological challenge to the scientists and engineers an...|$|R
