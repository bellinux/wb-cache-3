500|$|Thom Jurek from AllMusic {{described}} [...] "Sing" [...] as a [...] "huge feminist anthem" [...] {{and described}} it as consisting of a [...] "killer hook, a big bad soul/gospel refrain, and a beat that, <b>once</b> <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> into the spine, will not be easily dismissed". Boston Globes Sarah Rodman compared it to the Eurythmics' 1985 single [...] "Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves" [...] adding that it carried Lennox's characteristic messages of [...] "optimism and empowerment". Liz Hoggard of The Guardian called the song a [...] "showstopper" [...] and the collaboration as [...] "incandescent". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine also noted the anthemic nature of the track and its [...] "smartly plays more like a broad-spectrum sisters-are-doin’-it-for-themselves" [...] nature, while believing {{that it would have}} been better suited as the album's title song than Songs of Mass Destruction. Similar thoughts were echoed by Chris Jones of BBC News who felt that [...] "Sing" [...] was able to [...] "overcome its weighty agenda to take life as a great song in its own right".|$|E

Being able to keep it under wraps is {{therefore}} vital, otherwise you get competitive bids coming and the price spirals. Robbie is a proven entertainer and one of the top strikers in the Championship and we know he is always going to score goals. But the really important factor is that he is happy and keen to play for Burnley." [...] – Brendan Flood ...|$|E

60|$|So fast a hold has {{pride and}} {{ambition}} upon our minds, that when <b>once</b> <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> admission, nothing is so chimerical but, under this possession, we can form ideas of in our fancy and realise to our imagination. Nothing {{can be so}} ridiculous as the simple steps we take in such cases; {{a man or a}} woman becomes a mere malade imaginaire, and, I believe, may as easily die with grief or run mad with joy (as the affair in his fancy appears right or wrong) as if all was real, and actually under the management of the person.|$|E

60|$|BUILDER. Now, look here, Athene. It's {{always been}} my way to face {{accomplished}} facts. What's done can't be undone; {{but it can be}} remedied. You must marry this young----at <b>once,</b> before <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> out. He's behaved like a ruffian: but, by your own confession, you've behaved worse. You've been bitten by this modern disease, this--this, utter lack of common decency. There's an eternal order in certain things, and marriage is one of them; in fact, it's the chief. Come, now. Give me a promise, and I'll try my utmost to forget the whole thing.|$|R

5000|$|Gareth Jones of Dread Central {{gave the}} film 2 out of 5 knives, saying, [...] "Im {{sure it will}} do decent {{business}} among the undemanding weekend-horror crowd and Zellweger fans when it eventually sees the light of day. Nobody else need apply." [...] Margaret Pomeranz of the Australian version of At the Movies gave the film one out of 5 stars, calling it [...] "one of the least scary, dumbest movies I’ve {{seen in a long}} time". Co-host David Stratton gave it 1½ out of 5, commenting that [...] "once it sort of kicks into the plot - <b>once</b> <b>it</b> really <b>gets</b> down to the nitty gritty, like so many horror films it just becomes really ridiculous and silly".|$|R

5000|$|Bedding - Usually made of {{hardwood}} pulp, such as aspen, sometimes from shredded, uninked {{paper or}} recycled virgin wood pulp.

50|$|My {{feeling about}} a lot of those tools is their value in {{education}} is as much pointing out to people who are learning to write that they have choices and make choices when they do it.
