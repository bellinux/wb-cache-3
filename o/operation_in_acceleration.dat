40|$|In {{this study}} the {{performance}} {{characteristics of a}} CI engine which is fuelled with biodiesel blends during transient conditions were investigated experimentally based on a four-cylinder, four-stroke, direct injection (DI) and turbocharged diesel engine. Different blends from biodiesel and standard diesel (0 B, 20 B and 100 B, 20 B means 20 % biodiesel and 80 % diesel) were tested in the engine operating under two typical transient conditions: the speed varying event and the load varying event. During the experiment, in-cylinder pressure, fuel flow rate and exhaust temperature were measured and detail analyses were carried out on the measured parameters. The analysis conducted on the fuel flow rate shows that the fuel consumption of the engine running with 100 B is {{higher than that of}} diesel by 16 % and 14 % for the acceleration and deceleration transient operations respectively. These values increased to 17 % and 15 % for positive and negative load changes <b>operations.</b> <b>In</b> <b>acceleration</b> and deceleration conditions, the exhaust temperature of engine running with diesel is 2 % lower than that of using biodiesel blends. During load transients, the engine running with neat biodiesel produces 7 % higher exhaust gas temperature than that of running with diesel. The performance values of 20 B blends is in between that of the diesel and neat biodiesel for all key parameters...|$|R

Exemplary for the transient <b>operation</b> a step <b>in</b> <b>acceleration</b> pedal is investigated and optimised with respect to the engine emissions. This gives insights about the emission formation at transient driving and a benchmark for the design of open and closed-loop controls. A model structure to simulate the engine emissions and the engine torque is presented. It consists of a dynamical mean value air path model and a stationary combustion model. Thus the relevant outputs NOx, soot and torque are simulated with respect to the engine actuators. For optimisation the calibrated emission values for steady state are regarded. The actuators of the air path and the crank angle of the main injection are optimised such that the emissions follow a desired trajectory. The results are compared to a non-optimised step <b>in</b> <b>acceleration</b> and to a nonlinear closed loop control of the air path...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Humans die at an {{increasing}} rate {{until late in}} life, when mortality rates level off. The causes of the late-life mortality plateau have been debated extensively {{over the past few}} years. Here, I examine mortality patterns separately for each of the leading causes of death. The different causes of death show distinct mortality patterns, providing some clues about the varying acceleration of mortality at different ages. Results I examine mortality patterns by first plotting the data of mortality rate versus age on a log-log scale. The slope of the age-specific mortality rate at each age is the age-specific acceleration of mortality. About one-half of total deaths have causes with similar shapes for the age-specific acceleration of mortality: a steady rise <b>in</b> <b>acceleration</b> from midlife until a well-defined peak at 80 years, followed by a nearly linear decline <b>in</b> <b>acceleration.</b> This first group of causes includes heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and accidental deaths. A second group, accounting for about one-third of all deaths, follows a different pattern of age-specific acceleration. These diseases show an approximately linear rise <b>in</b> <b>acceleration</b> to a peak at 35 – 45 years of age, followed by a steep and steady decline <b>in</b> <b>acceleration</b> for the remainder of life. This second group includes cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, and liver disease. I develop a multistage model of disease progression to explain the observed patterns of mortality acceleration. Conclusions A multistage model of disease progression can explain both the early-life increase and late-life decrease <b>in</b> mortality <b>acceleration.</b> An early-life rise <b>in</b> <b>acceleration</b> may be caused by increasing rates of transition between stages as individuals grow older. The late-life decline <b>in</b> <b>acceleration</b> may be caused by progression through earlier stages, leaving only a few stages remaining for older individuals. </p...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{has been}} developed to examine {{the behavior of a}} titanium-water loop heat pipe (LHP) under standard and elevated acceleration fields. The LHP was mounted on a 2. 44 m diameter centrifuge table on edge with heat applied to the evaporator via a mica heater and heat rejected using a high-temperature polyalphaolefin oil (PAO) coolant loop. The LHP was tested under the following parametric ranges: heat load at the evaporator, 100 ≤ Qin ≤ 600 W; heat load at the compensation chamber, 0 ≤ Qcc ≤ 50 W; radial acceleration, 0 ≤ ar ≤ 10 g. For stationary operation, the evaporative heat transfer coefficient decreased monotonically with heat load while the thermal resistance decreased to a minimum then increased. Heat input to the compensation chamber was found to increase the evaporative heat transfer coefficient and decrease the thermal resistance for Qin = 500 W. Transient periodic flow reversal in the LHP was found for some cases, which was likely due to vapor bubble formation in the primary wick. <b>Operation</b> <b>in</b> an elevated <b>acceleration</b> environment revealed that dry-out was dependent on both Qin and ar, and the ability for the LHP to reprime after an acceleration event that induced dry-out was influenced by the evaporator temperature. The evaporative heat transfer coefficient and thermal resistance were found not to be significantly dependent on radial acceleration. However, the evaporator wall superheat was found to increase slightly with radial acceleration at high heat loads...|$|R
40|$|As {{electronics}} {{becomes more}} mobile, and its uses and applications more widespread, {{there is an}} increased need for a low-power yet powerful system to perform a multitude of varied of tasks. Downscaling the supply voltage improves a device’s power usage, but also severely impacts the overall performance. A careful balance must therefore be struck between {{the needs of the}} application in terms of processing speed versus power usage. The technique proposed in this paper allows the acceleration of a slow, multi- cycled combinatorial block beyond the performance generally attainable under the system’s supply voltage conditions, by exploiting the effective data-induced performance gain, ie. the fact that the critical path is only triggered for some data. Through the automatic insertion of dedicated transition detectors within the circuitry of the block itself, at the end of virtual ‘timezones’, the progress of the operation underway can be observed and prematurely completed when the data lends itself to it, thereby increasing the operation speed from the worst case towards the average case. Overall, synthesis results show the technique to have a good performance, significantly reducing the time required to complete operations under the tested combinatorial block. While extra design effort may achieve even better performance, this technique allows hassle-free <b>operation</b> <b>acceleration</b> <b>in</b> a fairly automated fashion...|$|R

An instrumented Hybrid III anthropomorphic head was fitted with a football helmet covered in a smooth control shell and with one covered in a shell with a designed geometry involving dimples and fin/channels. The head was dropped from a height of 73 inches (185. 42 cm) into a tank of water at varying impact angles and the peak accelerations were recorded and compared at each impact angle. High speed camera images were also taken to observe dynamic behavior of the water during the impact. The results showed an average reduction <b>in</b> <b>acceleration</b> over all angles of around 17 % and a peak reduction <b>in</b> <b>acceleration</b> of 37 % for impacts on the crown of the head. High speed camera analysis and acceleration analysis also revealed that fins were the dominant factor <b>in</b> <b>acceleration</b> reduction, but dimples did have a moderate effect. It was also determined that the reduction <b>in</b> <b>acceleration</b> created by the geometry could result in around a 30 % reduction in the probability of concussion at the optimal impact angle. Overall, these results showed that helmet geometry can significantly reduce the linear acceleration a head undergoes in high velocity water sports. Further investigation is needed to see how geometry influences rotational acceleration and how to implement this geometry into a helmet design...|$|R
