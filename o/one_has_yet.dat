5|$|Sea snakes were {{at first}} {{regarded}} as a unified and separate family, the Hydrophiidae, that later came to comprise two subfamilies: the Hydrophiinae, or true/aquatic sea snakes (now 16genera with 57species), and the more primitive Laticaudinae, or sea kraits (one genus, Laticauda, with five species). Eventually, as it became clear just how closely related the sea snakes are to the elapids, the taxonomic situation became less well-defined. Some taxonomists responded by moving the sea snakes to the Elapidae, thereby creating the subfamilies Elapinae, Hydrophiinae, and Laticaudinae, although the latter may be omitted if Laticauda {{is included in the}} Hydrophiinae. No <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> been able to convincingly work out the phylogenetic relationships between the various elapid subgroups, and the situation is still unclear. Therefore, others opted to either continue to work with the older traditional arrangements, if only for practical reasons, or to lump all of the genera together in the Elapidae, with no taxonomic subdivisions, to reflect the work that remains to be done.|$|E
25|$|Erythroxylaceae is {{a family}} of four genera. Erythroxylum has about 230 species. Nectaropetalum has eight species and Pinacopodium has two. No <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> {{produced}} a molecular phylogeny of the family.|$|E

So far no <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> found a clean uniform description of the finite simple groups similar to the parameterization of the compact Lie groups by Dynkin diagrams.|$|E

25|$|In {{the initial}} questioning, {{it comes to}} light that the {{previous}} owner of the house, Sellon, {{was found dead in}} his shop, supposedly from a fall down the stairs, but it might have been more nefarious than that. There were suspicions of involvement in drugs and Sellon also left a note to the effect that he had come across something worth fourteen thousand pounds but no <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> found out what the item was.|$|E
25|$|Trevor Ellis, a 26-year-old from Brixton Hill, died {{following}} a shooting in Croydon, South London on 8 August. His family denied reports that Ellis, {{who had come}} from the Brixton area to Croydon with a group of friends, had been involved in looting. By 16 December 2013, 13 people had been arrested in connection with the murder. All were later bailed and then released without action. On 16 December, the eve of Ellis's birthday, detectives opened up a fresh appeal into the murder, asking for witnesses to come forward. No <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> been charged.|$|E
25|$|Three former {{officials}} of the Ukrainian Interior Ministry's foreign surveillance department and criminal intelligence unit (Valeriy Kostenko, Mykola Protasov and Oleksandr Popovych) accused of his murder were arrested in March 2005 and a fourth one (Oleksiy Pukach, {{the former chief of}} the unit) in July 2009. A court in Ukraine sentenced Protasov to a sentence of 13 years and Kostenko and Popovych to 12-year terms March 2008 (the trial had begun January 2006) for the murder. Gongadze's family believe the trial had failed to bring the masterminds behind the killing to justice. No <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> been charged with giving the order for Gongadze's murder.|$|E

25|$|Richard Simon, biblical {{scholar and}} the first textual critic, dated the {{manuscript}} to the 10th century. According to palaeographer Bernard de Montfaucon and biblical scholar Scholz {{it was written in}} the 8th century. According to Leonard Hug, biblical scholar, it is not older than the ninth century, because no <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> shown that the compressed letters Σ, Ε, Ο, and Θ were ever used in manuscripts at so early a date as the 8th century. The letters Ζ and Ξ ever have their strokes prolonged beneath the line, or that the small strokes {{at the bottom of the}} letter Δ are ever extended below the line, in the manuscripts from the 8th century.|$|E
25|$|Literally {{the four}} paths of distraint, a {{process by which}} one could, under certain circumstances, seize goods owed by another. However, in Brehon law one does not {{immediately}} own the property, rather animals are taken to an intermediary land to wait in case the original owner pays the debt. As time passes, the animals are slowly forfeited. This tract deals primarily with four types of distraint, divided based on the waiting period. The waiting period apparently varies based on the circumstance although no <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> determined what exactly those circumstances are. Other material present includes information of other aspects of legal procedure and a long section where the author asks and then answers multiple times, why the tract is called Cethairslicht Athgabálae.|$|E
25|$|The two {{horsemen}} of {{this particular}} apocalypse—the external deficit and the swift rise of Central Bank credit—would have made 1988 a bad year no matter what else happened. But President García guaranteed financial disaster by his totally unexpected decision in July 1987 to nationalize the banks not already under government ownership. No <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> been able {{to explain why he}} decided to do so. It would not seem to have been a move necessary for any component of his program, or needed for government control in a banking sector in which it already had a dominant position. In any case, the action underlined the unilateral character of economic policy action under Peru's presidential system and wrecked any possibilities of further cooperation with private sector leadership. Private investment began to fall, and the whole economy followed it down shortly thereafter.|$|E

500|$|SaGa Frontier Original Sound Track {{comprises}} 75 tracks spanning three compact discs. It {{was released}} in Japan on April 21, 1999 by DigiCube and was later reprinted by Square Enix on February 1, 2006. On disc 3 of the soundtrack, there is a hidden track, in the pregap, {{which can only be}} heard when rewinding the CD from the beginning; this was originally supposed to be Riki's theme. There also are alternate titles for those pieces of music which {{can be seen in the}} songlist in the in-game [...] "2nd Division".

500|$|Rogers {{encountered}} {{various problems}} along the way. Forty of the Bristol crew deserted or were dismissed, {{and he spent}} a month in Ireland recruiting replacements and having the vessels prepared for sea. Many crew members were Dutch, Danish, or other foreigners. [...] Some of the crew mutinied after Rogers refused to let them plunder a neutral Swedish vessel. When the mutiny was put down, he had the leader flogged, put in irons, and sent to England aboard another ship. The less culpable mutineers were given lighter punishments, such as reduced rations. [...] The ships intended to force the chilly Drake Passage off the tip of South America, but expedition leaders soon realised that they were short of warm clothing and alcohol, which was then believed to warm those exposed to cold. Considering the latter the more important problem, the expedition made a stop at Tenerife {{to stock up on}} the local wine, and later sewed the ships' blankets into cold weather gear. [...] The ships experienced a difficult inter-oceanic passage; they were forced to almost 62° South latitude, which, according to Rogers, [...] "for ought we know is the furthest that any <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> been to the southward". [...] At their furthest south, they were closer to as-yet-undiscovered Antarctica than to South America.|$|E
60|$|In the Strangers' Room of the Olympic Club the air {{was thick}} with tobacco-smoke, and, despite the bitter cold outside, the {{temperature}} was uncomfortably high.

Without such a proof-of-principle, explanations have tended to focus on chemosynthesis. However, some researchers work in this field, notably Steen Rasmussen and Jack W. Szostak. Others have argued that a [...] "top-down approach" [...] is more feasible. One such approach, successfully attempted by Craig Venter and others at J. Craig Venter Institute, involves engineering existing prokaryotic cells with progressively fewer genes, attempting to discern at which point the most minimal requirements for life are reached.|$|E
