5|$|Although Mr. Bean is the <b>only</b> <b>significant</b> {{character}} in the programme, others appear, usually as foils for his various antics. Other than his girlfriend there are more characters in each episode. However, several notable British actors and comedians appear alongside Atkinson in sketches as various one-off supporting characters, including Owen Brenman, Richard Briers, Angus Deayton, Stephen Frost, Nick Hancock, Christopher Ryan, Paul Bown, Caroline Quentin, Danny La Rue, Roger Lloyd-Pack, David Schneider and Richard Wilson.|$|E

5|$|Delivered to the Navy on January 30, 1937, the {{aircraft}} was officially {{presented to the}} public at Hall's Bristol, Pennsylvania factory in April of that year. The aircraft's early flight testing, starting in February and conducted by test pilot Bill McAvoy, showed that the XPTBH had few faults, with the <b>only</b> <b>significant</b> issue being a lack of roll authority – a reduction of the ability of the ailerons to turn {{the aircraft}} – {{as a result of the}} surface area of the floats. A modification to increase the area of the rudder solved the issue. The aircraft's water-handling characteristics were found to be excellent; the <b>only</b> <b>significant</b> complaints that surfaced during the testing period concerned the XPTBH-2's beaching gear, which was found to be extremely difficult to use in anything other than the calmest water.|$|E
5|$|Few fossils {{have been}} found in the Ringbone Formation, the <b>only</b> <b>significant</b> one being a {{specimen}} that is either Albertosaurus sp. or Daspletosaurus sp., known from a tooth and vertebrae. The only reason the Ringbone Formation is assigned to the Kirtlandian age is because the rocks are the same age as the Fort Crittenden Formation, which contains one of the index taxa of the Kirtlandian.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) {{produced}} 125grams of 99.9% pure protactinium by processing 60tonnes {{of waste}} material in a 12-stage process, {{at a cost}} of about 500,000USD. For many years, this was the world's <b>only</b> <b>significant</b> supply of protactinium, which was provided to various laboratories for scientific studies. Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the US provided protactinium {{at a cost of}} about 280USD/gram.|$|E

5|$|The German army's rapid {{manoeuvres}} {{during the}} invasion had forced the tactical withdrawal of Yugoslav forces facing Hungarian army units {{and there was}} no significant fighting between the two armies. The Hungarian forces advanced south to the Danube between Vukovar and the confluence with the Tisza without any real military resistance. Serb Chetnik irregulars fought isolated engagements, and the Hungarian General Staff considered irregular resistance forces to be their <b>only</b> <b>significant</b> opposition.|$|E
5|$|The {{extension}} runs {{in its own}} right-of-way on a route {{similar to}} that of the Dulles Access Road, running both at grade and via aerial structures.

5|$|The <b>only</b> <b>significant</b> Christian {{success of}} the Second Crusade came to a {{combined}} force of 13,000 Flemish, Frisian, Norman, English, Scottish, and German crusaders in 1147. Travelling from England, by ship, to the Holy Land, the army stopped and helped the smaller (7,000) Portuguese army in the capture of Lisbon, expelling its Moorish occupants.|$|E
5|$|The {{village of}} Woolhampton and the canal {{settlement}} of Aldermaston Wharf are the <b>only</b> <b>significant</b> settlements until the river enters the built-up area of Reading at Sheffield Lock in Theale.

5|$|After an unopposed landing, a mixed {{force of}} German reservists and half-trained Melanesian police mounted a stout {{resistance}} {{and forced the}} Australians to fight {{their way to the}} objective. After a day of fighting during which both sides suffered casualties, Australian forces captured the wireless station at Bita Paka. The battle was Australia's first major military engagement of the war and the <b>only</b> <b>significant</b> action of the campaign; in its aftermath the remaining German forces on New Britain fled inland to Toma. Following a brief siege there the German garrison capitulated, ending resistance to the Australian occupation of the island.|$|E

5|$|After the Federal army {{rebuilt the}} City Point Railroad, Grant used mortars to attack Lee's {{overstretched}} forces. In August, Union forces captured Mobile Bay and on September 2, Sherman captured Atlanta while Confederate forces retreated. Both victories, combined with Sheridan's triumph in the Shenandoah Valley, ensured Lincoln's reelection in November. Sherman convinced Grant and Lincoln {{to send his}} army to march on Savannah and devastate the Confederate heartland. Sherman cut a 60-mile path of destruction of Southern infrastructure unopposed, reached the Atlantic Ocean, and captured Savannah on December 22. On December 16, after much prodding by Grant, the Union Army under Thomas smashed Hood's Confederate Army at Nashville. It {{was the beginning of}} the end for the Confederacy, with Lee's forces at Petersburg being the <b>only</b> <b>significant</b> obstacle remaining.|$|E
5|$|As an {{expansion}} pack for Half-Life, Blue Shift is a first-person shooter. The overall gameplay of Blue Shift does not significantly differ {{from that of}} Half-Life: players are required to navigate through the game's levels, fight hostile non-player characters and solve a variety of puzzles to advance. The game continues Half-Lifes methods of an unbroken narrative. The player sees everything through the first person perspective of the protagonist and remains {{in control of the}} player character for almost all of the game. Story events are conveyed through the use of scripted sequences rather than cut scenes. Progress through the game's world is continuous; although the game is divided up into chapters, the <b>only</b> <b>significant</b> pauses are when the game needs to load the next part of an environment.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of 1796 French and allied forces had been almost {{completely}} driven from the Indian Ocean, most of the colonies of the French-allied Batavian Republic falling to British invasions during 1795. The <b>only</b> <b>significant</b> French presence was on Île de France {{and a few other}} nearby islands, from which a squadron of two frigates periodically operated against British trade. The British were so confident of supremacy that they had split their forces, with a large squadron based at Simon's Town in the Cape Colony of Southern Africa under Sir George Keith Elphinstone and a smaller dispersed force operating under Peter Rainier in the Dutch East Indies, based at the captured port of Malacca. The important trading ports of Calcutta, Madras and Bombay were largely undefended, as were the valuable trade routes which supported them.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the {{outbreak}} of World War II in September 1939, only two of the ships had been commissioned, with the third being brought into service three months after the war started. Their <b>only</b> <b>significant</b> pre-war task was undertaken by Beograd in May 1939, and involved the transportation of a large portion of Yugoslavia's gold reserve to the United Kingdom for safekeeping. On 24 January 1940, Ljubljana ran into a reef off the Yugoslav port of Šibenik. The hull side was breached and despite efforts to get the ship into the port, it sank close to shore, and some of the crew swam to safety. One crew member died, and the captain was arrested pending an investigation.|$|E
5|$|By 1525, Reading was {{the largest}} town in Berkshire, and tax returns show that Reading was the 10th largest town in England when {{measured}} by taxable wealth. By 1611, it had a population of over 5000 and had grown rich on its trade in cloth. The town was seriously affected by the English Civil War, with a major siege and loss of trade, and {{played a pivotal role}} in the Revolution of 1688, with that revolution's <b>only</b> <b>significant</b> military action fought {{on the streets of the}} town.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1950s, British Railways {{had begun}} to operate in {{regional}} units, and responsibility for services on the former Great Central routes in the Chilterns {{was transferred to the}} London Midland Region. Services on the branch were generally hauled by LMS Ivatt Class locomotives, although passenger trains continued to use the 1898 Ashbury cars. British Railways continued to operate goods services on the branch, although these declined steadily owing to competition from road haulage to the point at which coal deliveries were the <b>only</b> <b>significant</b> business.|$|E
