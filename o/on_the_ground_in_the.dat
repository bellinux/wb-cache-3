5|$|The Sooner defense played {{extremely}} well in Waco, limiting Baylor to 148total yards and -48yards of rushing. That was the fewest yards Baylor had produced all season and their worst performance <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> program's history; {{it was also}} the second-best performance by an Oklahoma defense ever. Defensive back Reggie Smith also pulled down two interceptions, returning the first one 42yards for a touchdown.|$|E

The four-armed god holds a sruka and sruva (sacrificial ladle and spoon) in his front arms and a kamandalu (water-pot) and akshamala (rosary) {{in his back}} arms. The presence of the fire also indicates another important ritual of the Hindu wedding, saptapadi ("seven steps") where {{the bride and groom}} go around the fire seven times.|$|E
5|$|Wyatt altered {{his story}} later on, telling John H. Flood {{that he did}} not see Brocius's pistol <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark until afterward. The pistol {{contained}} one expended cartridge and five live rounds. Brocius waived a preliminary hearing so he and his case could be transferred to Tucson District Court. Virgil and Wyatt escorted Brocius to Tucson to stand trial, possibly saving him from a lynching. White, age 31, died of his wound two days after his shooting.|$|E

5|$|Clemson's {{offense was}} led by quarterback Woodrow Dantzler, who {{finished}} the regular season having completed 58 percent of his passes for 1,691 yards, 10 touchdowns, and six interceptions. He also ran the ball extremely successfully, gaining 947 yards and 13 touchdowns <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> running game, Dantzler had the second-most yards on the team. No. 1 was running back Travis Zachery, who ran 201 times for 1,012 yards and 13 touchdowns. Zachery also was one of Dantzler's favorite passing targets. He caught 27 passes for 288 {{yards and four touchdowns}} during the regular season.|$|E
5|$|The way the {{painting}} shows {{the progress of}} time is also without precedent in Western art. The death of a blameless victim had typically been presented as a conclusive episode, imbued with the virtue of heroism. The Third of May offers no such cathartic message. Instead, there is a continuous procession of the condemned in a mechanical formalization of murder. The inevitable outcome {{is seen in the}} corpse of a man, splayed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower left portion of the work. There is no room left for the sublime; his head and body have been disfigured to a degree that renders resurrection impossible. The victim is portrayed bereft of all aesthetic or spiritual grace. For the rest of the picture the viewer's eye level is mostly along the central horizontal axis; only here is the perspectival point of view changed, so that the viewer looks down on the mutilated body.|$|E
5|$|With the Observer Corps {{passing a}} steady stream of reports {{regarding}} approaching German formations they soon realised a coordinated attack was under way. The two Squadrons approaching the high-altitude attack could not be diverted and no fighters had been asked to engage the 9 Staffel. The only Squadron <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area was No. 111 Squadron RAF that had 12 Hurricanes at RAF Croydon. Although usually the responsibility of Park, the controllers took the matter into their own hands and ordered all aircraft into the air. Even those that were not in combat condition were flown north-east, to avoid them being caught on the ground.|$|E

5|$|During his convalescence, he {{was visited}} by the General der Jagdflieger (General of Fighters), Generalleutnant Adolf Galland, who offered Graf command {{of his old}} unit, JG52. Graf {{accepted}} {{with the proviso that}} his Roten Jäger football team went with him. Once criticized for its low scoring rate early in the war, it was now the pre-eminent Geschwader, with over 10,000 victories. His return was celebrated with a welcome dinner at its headquarters in Kraków, southern Poland, on 20 September 1944. He was officially appointed on 1 October. Ongoing weakness in his left arm kept Graf <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> two years since he had left the Eastern Front, {{the quantity and quality of}} the Soviet pilots had greatly improved, as had their equipment. For the remainder of the war he oversaw his three separated fighter groups shuttled up and down the front, in emergency responses to each new Soviet offensive. Several times the crews had to evacuate as Soviet tanks and artillery were shelling their airfield. The German fuel crisis severely curtailed the amount of flight-time. Consequently, the November total for the wing of only 369 Soviet aircraft shot down was the lowest monthly total of the eastern campaign. As the winter weather got worse, the lull allowed Graf to organise a football match between his Roten Jäger and a local Kraków team, watched by 20,000 German soldiers.|$|E
5|$|On 3 June, the French {{units were}} warned {{an hour before}} the German bombers took off, but owing to equally poor staff work, few French squadrons heard the {{scramble}} signal when it was radioed from the Eiffel Tower and some were caught <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> end, only eighty took off to intercept the incoming German formations. German progress was monitored by shadowing Potez 631s, one of which was shot down. The Germans would copy this tactic when intercepting United States Army Air Force (USAAF) heavy bombers during the Defence of the Reich campaign. Along with French AAA defences, the fighters shot down ten German aircraft, including four bombers. One of these machines was piloted by Geschwaderkommodore of KG 51, Josef Kammhuber, who was wounded in action and taken as a prisoner of war. Kammhuber would be released after the French surrender. He was replaced as Geschwaderkommodore of KG 51 by Fisser, commander of KG 77. Fisser was killed two months later leading KG 51 during the Battle of Britain.Jagdfliegerführer 3 (Fighter Flying Leader 3) Oberst Gerd von Massow was also shot down. He was replaced by Oberst Werner Junck, until the former's release by German forces on 12 June 1940. German formations attacked twenty-eight railways and marshalling yard centres. All damage inflicted was light. None were out of action for more than 24 hours.|$|E

The magazine is inserted front end first {{in a similar manner}} to the AK family. An optional magazine adaptor enables the use of M16 type STANAG magazines.

Although much of the RoIAF was destroyed in the air or <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> following days, the Iraqi Gladiators kept flying {{until the end of the}} war, carrying out strafing attacks on A Company of 1 Battalion The Essex Regiment on the outskirts of Baghdad on 30 May.|$|E
