Lubiprostone is a bicyclic fatty acid (prostaglandin E1 derivative) that acts by specifically activating ClC-2 chloride channels on the apical aspect of gastrointestinal epithelial cells, producing a chloride-rich fluid secretion. These secretions soften the stool, increase motility, and promote spontaneous bowel movements. Unlike many laxative products, lubiprostone does not show signs of tolerance, dependency, or altered serum electrolyte concentration.|$|R

40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{evaluate}} the efficiency of using the <b>osmotic</b> <b>laxative</b> polyethyleneglycol 4000 (PEG) for treatment of constipation in children. Patients and methods : Under the medical practice, the 30 -days course of <b>osmotic</b> <b>laxative</b> polyethyleneglycol 4000 (PEG) administration in compliance with instruction for use was scheduled for 31 children within the age group from 5 to 17 years (average age 10. 0 ± 3. 5 years) in order to treat the constipation. The progress of clinical presentation and electric activity indices in different regions of gastrointestinal tract was evaluated by method of Peripheral Electrogastroenterography (PEGEG). Results: Before the start of the study most children had reported the stool retention (90 %), straining efforts (87 %), constrained defecation (81 %) and hard stool (77 %). About 50 % of children had reported the long time spent in the toilet (68 %) and scybalous stool (55 %). As a result of the treatment the stool frequency has normalized and other constipation presentations have significantly reduced in all patient. Large bowel eclectic activity indices indicated the continuous impairment of its content evacuation. Simultaneously, the progress evaluation of electric activity progress in different regions of gastrointestinal tract (Pi/PS) and the large bowel rhythmicity ratio (Kritm) indicated the improvement on its peristalsis contractility.

40|$|Irritable bowel {{syndrome}} and functional constipation represent a relevant and common health issue. However, real-world clinical practice includes patients with constipation {{who may or}} may not have other abdominal complaints (pain, bloating, abdominal discomfort) with variable frequency. The goal of the present study was to obtain information on the workload entailed by patients with constipation and associated abdominal complaints, predominant clinical behaviors, education needs, and potential daily practice aids both in Primary Care and gastroenterology settings. The clinical behavior of doctors is generally similar at both levels, despite differences in healthcare approach: use of empiric therapies and clinically guided diagnostic tests, with some differences in colonoscopy use (not always directly accessible from Primary Care). Regarding perceptions, general support and <b>osmotic</b> <b>laxatives</b> are most valued by PC doctors, whereas <b>osmotic</b> <b>laxatives,</b> combined laxatives, and linaclotide are most valued by GE specialists. Furthermore, over half of respondents considered differentiating both diagnoses as challenging. Finally, considerable education needs are self-acknowledged at both levels, as is a demand for guidelines and protocols to help in managing this issue in clinical practice. A strength of this study is its providing a joint photograph of the medical approach and the perceptions of constipation with abdominal discomfort from a medical standpoint.

40|$|Background: Chronic {{constipation}} is {{a common}} functional disorder of the gastrointestinal tract, affecting up to 35 % of the general population, and especially the elderly. However, its definition as perceived by the patient can vary, {{making it difficult to}} understand the problem and find appropriate therapeutic measures. The approach to chronic constipation, thus, needs a thorough understanding of the patient's complaint and the main pathophysiological mechanism requiring treatment. Lifestyle changes do not usually meet with complete patient satisfaction. Other treatments include different types of <b>laxatives.</b> Of these, <b>osmotic</b> <b>laxatives</b> appear {{one of the most effective}} and are, therefore, frequently prescribed. Design: This review will cover the topic of <b>osmotic</b> <b>laxatives,</b> specifically focusing on polyethylene glycol (PEG/macrogol 4000) in chronic constipation and as a key agent for bowel cleansing prior to colonoscopy. PEG formulations, including macrogol 4000, are safe, effective treatments for constipation, even in children and elderly patients. Macrogol 4000 may well be more palatable than combined formulations (macrogol 3350 with electrolytes), which could help improve adherence to the long-term treatment required for chronic constipation. Conclusions: PEG/macrogol is also recommended as an effective option for bowel cleansing prior to colonoscopy. The improved cost-effectiveness of macrogol over other commonly prescribed laxatives, such as lactulose, should be taken into consideration...|$|R

All women were counselled as to the risks of the procedure and pre-operatively had a bowel cleansing preparation. This consisted of a 3 -day, low-residue diet followed by an <b>osmotic</b> <b>laxative</b> (Citramag) 12  h prior to surgery.

All identified lesions were described in terms of their visual appearance, location and whether they presented as superficial peritoneal lesions, typically red, black or white,(class  1 or Sampson’s disease), or deep lesions, typically infiltrating or nodular (class  2 or Cullen’s disease). If a combination of lesions were present then these were grouped as ‘deep’ (class  2), since the assumption was made that this was more severe and thus the predominant feature. The r-ASRM score was also calculated during the surgical episode.|$|E

40|$|The {{second part}} of the Consensus Statement of the Italian Association of Hospital Gastroenterologists and Italian Society of Colo-Rectal Surgery reports on the {{treatment}} of chronic constipation and obstructed defecation. There is no evidence that increasing fluid intake and physical activity can relieve the symptoms of chronic constipation. Patients with normal-transit constipation should increase their fibre intake through their diet or with commercial fibre. <b>Osmotic</b> <b>laxatives</b> may be effective in patients who do not respond to fibre supplements. Stimulant laxatives should be reserved for patients who do not respond to <b>osmotic</b> <b>laxatives.</b> Controlled trials have shown that serotoninergic enterokinetic agents, such as prucalopride, and prosecretory agents, such as lubiprostone, are effective in the treatment of patients with chronic constipation. Surgery is sometimes necessary. Total colectomy with ileorectostomy may be considered in patients with slow-transit constipation and inertia coli who are resistant to medical therapy and who do not have defecatory disorders, generalised motility disorders or psychological disorders. Randomised controlled trials have established the efficacy of rehabilitative treatment in dys-synergic defecation. Many surgical procedures may be used to treat obstructed defecation in patients with acquired anatomical defects, but none is considered to be the gold standard. Surgery should be reserved for selected patients with an impaired quality of life. Obstructed defecation is often associated with pelvic organ prolapse. Surgery with the placement of prostheses is replacing fascial surgery in the treatment of pelvic organ prolapse, but the efficacy and safety of such procedures have not yet been established.
