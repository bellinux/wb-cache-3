Topics discussed include implementation of the time-stepping algorithm, considerations involving the ef- fective interaction, and the use (or not) of <b>particular</b> <b>optional</b> terms in the energy density functional, and boundary conditions. Examples of application of the technique to giant resonances and reactions are given, concentrating on issues to do with numerical and conceptual interpretation...|$|R

It reveals {{the quantity and}} quality of shifts of cohesion and the extent to which these are influenced by the differences between the languages, the stereotypical features of the kind of translation (news translation) and the genre (news story). Results indicate no significant quantitative shifts in translation; the in-depth analysis of the corpus, on the other hand, shows considerable qualitative shifts, some of which (<b>optional</b> shifts in <b>particular)</b> modify news contents. The paper also investigates the validity of the explicitation and the repetition avoidance hypotheses regarded as universals of translation. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{opening of}} the school raised concern in secular France where even private {{religious}} schools are required {{to use the same}} core curriculum, can only teach religious subjects as electives, and where prayer must be <b>optional.</b> There was <b>particular</b> concern that the Al-Imane mosque is affiliated with the Union of Islamic Organizations in France, a powerful group that promotes a strict interpretation of Islam that includes grass-roots proselytizing, personal purification, and seeks to influence every aspect of a Muslim’s life. The UOIF has been described as inseparable from the Muslim Brotherhood. In a report commissioned by the French government, the Muslim Brotherhood in Europe, as represented by the UOIF are the source of half of the institutional projects in France aiming to re-Islamize the younger generations and maintain their cultural specificity while creating a Muslim citizenship.|$|R
40|$|The {{achievements}} of media education {{in higher education}} of Germany have been highlighted. The notions of media education that exist in scientific literature have been outlined. Media education {{has been defined as}} a direction in pedagogy (media pedagogy) aimed at an individual’s media-culture formation in society, as well as a process of development and self-development by means of media materials and mass media. The main goal of media education is to enhance general, professional, communicative and creative competences. The main national programs of media education implementation into educational process of Ukraine and Germany are the following: “New Media in Education”, “Media-pedagogical manifest”, “Concept of Introduction of Media Education in Ukraine”. The process of media pedagogy implementation in future native language teachers’ professional training in Germany is developing in three directions: integrated, special and <b>optional.</b> In <b>particular,</b> the attention has been focused on using methods of media education in higher philological schools (methods of creative writing - creative linguistic project of German language teaching; portfolio as a method of students’ media literacy (media competence) formation; methods of presenting a term paper in a form of television project; creating video libraries for teachers and students). The ways of implementing German experience in future philology teachers’ professional training at Sumy State Pedagogical University named after A. S. Makarenko have been considered. The activity of students’ scientific circle “Media Culture of Philology Teacher” has been characterized...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} model of neural {{networks}} consisting of populations of perceptive neurons, inter-neurons, and motor neurons according {{to the theory of}} stochastic phase resetting dynamics. According to this model, the dynamical characteristics of neural networks are studied in three coupling cases, namely, series and parallel coupling, series coupling, and unilateral coupling. The results show that the indentified structure of neural networks enables the basic characteristics of neural information processing to be described in terms of the actions of both the optional motor and the reflected motor. The excitation of local neural networks is caused by the action of the <b>optional</b> motor. In <b>particular,</b> the excitation of the neural population caused by the action of the optional motor in the motor cortex is larger than that caused by the action of the reflected motor. This phenomenon indicates that there are more neurons participating in the neural information processing and the excited synchronization motion under the action of the optional motor.

40|$|We present new {{results in}} fixed {{priority}} scheduling for imprecise computation in real-time systems. Imprecise computation {{has not been}} popularized enough for reasons which are rooted from the task model, scheduling methods (EDF-based) and general system support. Audsley et al. have devised schedulability tests for guaranteeing mandatory computation while incorporating unbounded <b>optional</b> components. In <b>particular,</b> the task model is defined {{to be of the}} form “Prologue-Optional-Epilogue”, which is a generalisation of the traditional “Mandatory-Optional ” task model of Liu el al [...] However, problems are discovered in the proposed schedulability tests which can make calculation of task’s worst-case response time inaccurate. Besides presenting the problem and proposing the required fixes, we prove the tests can be simplified under deadline monotonic priority ordering. We also propose a novel scheduling scheme, based on Dual Priority Scheduling, to maximize the scheduling of unbounded optional components, along with the required schedulability tests. The application of the new scheme shows substantial improvement. With its basis on fixed priority scheduling, it is expected the scheme can be easily incorporated into existing real-time operating systems and provoke wider use of imprecise computing...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the NP-hard single machine total {{weighted}} tardiness scheduling problem in presence of sequence-dependent setup times {{is faced with}} a new Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) approach. The proposed ACO algorithm {{is based on a}} new global pheromone update mechanism, which makes the pheromone trails asymptotically range between two bounds arbitrarily fixed and the ACO learning mechanism independent of the values of the objective function of the considered problem. Other features of the algorithm include a diversification mechanism for the solution construction phase based on a local pheromone update rule whose effects are restricted to the single iterations, and a cumulative option for the global pheromone update rule. An experimental campaign, carried out on a benchmark available from the literature, was executed to evaluate the proposed ACO and the effectiveness of its <b>optional</b> features. In <b>particular,</b> the obtained results were compared with the ones of a recently proposed ACO algorithm for the same problem by Liao and Juan (2005).

40|$|Self-interest {{frequently}} causes individuals {{engaged in}} joint enterprises to choose {{actions that are}} counterproductive. Free-riders can invade a society of cooperators, causing a tragedy of the commons. Such social dilemmas can be overcome by positive or negative incentives. Even though an incentive-providing institution may protect a cooperative society from invasion by free-riders, it cannot always convert a society of free-riders to cooperation. In the latter case, both norms, cooperation and defection, are stable: To avoid a collapse to full defection, cooperators must be sufficiently numerous initially. A society of free-riders is then caught in a social trap, and the institution is unable to provide an escape, except at a high, possibly prohibitive cost. Here, we analyze the interplay of (a) incentives provided by institutions and (b) the effects of voluntary participation. We show that this combination fundamentally improves the efficiency of incentives. In <b>particular,</b> <b>optional</b> participation allows institutions punishing free-riders to overcome the social dilemma {{at a much lower}} cost, and to promote a globally stable regime of cooperation. This removes the social trap and implies that whenever a society of cooperators cannot be invaded by free-riders, it will necessarily become established in the long run, through social learning, irrespective of the initial number of cooperators. We also demonstrate that punishing provides a "lighter touch" than rewarding, guaranteeing full cooperation at considerably lower cost...|$|R
40|$|Today, {{there is}} little {{knowledge}} on the attitude state of decommissioned intact objects in Earth orbit. Observational means have advanced in the past years, but are still limited with respect to an accurate estimate of motion vector orientations and magnitude. Especially for the preparation of Active Debris Removal (ADR) missions as planned by ESA’s Clean Space initiative or contingency scenarios for ESA spacecraft like ENVISAT, such knowledge is needed. ESA's “Debris Attitude Motion Measurements and Modelling” project (ESA Contract No. 40000112447), led by the Astronomical Institute of the University of Bern (AIUB), addresses this problem. The goal of the project is to achieve {{a good understanding of}} the attitude evolution and the considerable internal and external effects which occur. To characterize the attitude state of selected targets in LEO and GTO, multiple observation methods are combined. Optical observations are carried out by AIUB, Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) is performed by the Space Research Institute of the Austrian Academy of Sciences (IWF) and radar measurements and signal level determination are provided by the Fraunhofer Institute for High Frequency Physics and Radar Techniques (FHR). The In-Orbit Tumbling Analysis tool (ιOTA) is a prototype software, currently in development by Hyperschall Technologie Göttingen GmbH (HTG) {{within the framework of the}} project. ιOTA will be a highly modular software tool to perform short-(days), medium-(months) and long-term (years) propagation of the orbit and attitude motion (six degrees-of-freedom) of spacecraft in Earth orbit. The simulation takes into account all relevant acting forces and torques, including aerodynamic drag, solar radiation pressure, gravitational influences of Earth, Sun and Moon, eddy current damping, impulse and momentum transfer from space debris or micro meteoroid impact, as well as the <b>optional</b> definition of <b>particular</b> spacecraft specific influences like tank sloshing, reaction wheel behaviour, magnetic torquer activity and thruster firing. The purpose of ιOTA is to provide high accuracy short-term simulations to support observers and potential ADR missions, as well as medium-and long-term simulations to study the significance of the particular internal and external influences on the attitude, especially damping factors and momentum transfer. The simulation will also enable the investigation of the altitude dependency of the particular external influences. ιOTA's post-processing modules will generate synthetic measurements for observers and for software validation. The validation of the software will be done by cross-calibration with observations and measurements acquired by the project partners...|$|R
40|$|The United States has {{achieved}} defense superiority in air, land, and sea while {{using some of}} the most advanced defense systems in the world. However, underlying this success is a troubled procurement system. Enterprise-wide problems such as poor integration between the three components (JCIDS, DAS, PPBE) of DoD acquisition and inadequate management of procurement personnel have undermined the potential of the Department of Defense. One particular area for improvement is the need for understanding the overlaps, gaps, and interdependencies of the capability portfolio. Information is a precondition to attaining that knowledge. Information is embodied in capability documents and architecture frameworks and drives the critical process of determining the right capability requirements upfront, a vital task in saving costs. (Wirthlin, 1994) The stakeholders need a comprehensive understanding of the capability portfolio during this validation process but information can be trapped in functional stovepipes. DoD Architecture Framework (DoDAF) holds much promise in enhancing the visibility and traceability of information in the capability portfolio to the stakeholders. It is a more structured way to capture and analyze information than free-text documents. The most recent JCIDS manual published in February 2015 added a new requirement to submit seven DoDAF viewpoints during the ICD submission. This indicates the potential of DoDAF viewpoints to be able to provide a full representation of a capability requirement so it can be validated in light of a holistic understanding of the portfolio. The purpose of this thesis is to analyze whether DoDAF alone can provide a holistic understanding of a capability requirement during this early front-end validation. The analysis examines the information captured by the viewpoints by comparing it to ICD information requirements. The results of the analysis reveal the benefits of DoDAF in its ability to capture more detailed information such as resource flows in structured form. A second finding revealed that the seven DoDAF viewpoints were missing key information elements about the capability requirement such as related missions and strategy documents that limit holistic visibility of the capability portfolio. Lastly, there were additional limitations such as the challenge of determining the level of specificity in the viewpoints. Recommendations include changing <b>particular</b> <b>optional</b> data fields to mandatory and adding the CV- 1 and OV- 3 viewpoints to provide more information about the capability requirement. by Michael N.

40|$|O objeto {{principal}} da dissertação é a análise do regime jurídico da exclusão de sócios nas sociedades limitadas, nos termos do Código Civil de 2002 (Lei Federal n° 10. 406 / 02). Parte-se de um exame do percurso histórico de afirmação do instituto, entrelaçado com uma visão panorâmica da disciplina atual da matéria em alguns dos ordenamentos que mais influenciaram o Direito brasileiro, com destaque para Alemanha, França e, sobretudo, Itália. Em relação à experiência brasileira anterior à promulgação do Código Civil de 2002, o estudo concentra-se em demonstrar o caráter eminentemente doutrinário e jurisprudencial da consolidação do instituto. De fato, sempre sob a vigência do Código Comercial de 1850, à margem de quaisquer mudanças legislativas de maior relevo, a possibilidade de exclusão de sócios foi primeiramente recusada, para paulatinamente ser aceita e, finalmente, ser aplicada com exagerada liberalidade. Conceitualmente, a exclusão é enquadrada como uma expressão da especialidade da sociedade, enquanto contrato plurilateral. A exclusão facultativa, em particular - em oposição à exclusão de pleno direito -, é vista como manifestação peculiar da resolução contratual por inadimplemento. O estudo compreende uma análise crítica das disposições do Código Civil de 2002 em matéria societária, além de uma investigação das causas e procedimentos de exclusão sob a vigência de tal diploma. As principais teses defendidas no trabalho são: (i) a diferença estrutural entre a exclusão facultativa, objeto tradicional de estudo da doutrina brasileira, e a exclusão de pleno direito - novidade introduzida no ordenamento brasileiro por inspiração direta da lei italiana -; (ii) deficiência e inadequação da teoria do rompimento da affectio societatis como justa causa para a exclusão; (iii) a duplicidade de procedimentos para a exclusão facultativa, relativamente à sociedade limitada, com o convívio dos procedimentos de exclusão judicial e extrajudicial; (iv) a impossibilidade de se equiparar a assembléia ou reunião de exclusão a julgamento, recusando-se a atribuição de um verdadeiro d̈ireito de defesaäo sócio que se deseja excluir. The {{main purpose}} of the essay is to review the legal discipline of the exclusion of a partner from a limited liability company under {{the provisions of the}} Civil Code of 2002 (Federal Law n. 10406 / 02). The analysis starts with a review of the historical development of the right of exclusion, combined with an overview of the current legal treatment of the issue in a number of jurisdictions that exercised the most relevant influence on Brazilian Law; in particular Germany, France and - above all- Italy. On what regards Brazilian experience prior to the enactment of the Civil Code of 2002, the analysis focuses on illustrating how the development of the right exclusion was mostly based on academic studies and case law. As a matter of fact, under the provisions of the Commercial Code 1850, in spite of the lack of any relevant reforms on statutory legislation, the possibility of exclusion of partner was, at first, rejected and then, gradually accepted. At a later phase, exclusion was even applied without due control. Conceptually, the exclusion of a partner is classified as an expression of the special nature of the company as a plurilateral agreement. In <b>particular,</b> <b>optional</b> exclusion - unlike mandatory exclusion - is seen as a special form of contract termination due to material breach. The research comprehends a critical review of the provisions of the Civil Code of 2002 on corporate law, in addition to an analysis of relevant causes and procedures for the exclusion of a partner under said law. The main theses defended are the following: (i) existence of structural differences between optional exclusion - traditional object of study by Brazilian academics - and mandatory exclusion - a new procedure introduced {{as a result of the}} direct Italian influence on Brazilian law -, (ii) problems and inadequacy of the theory of rupture of affectio societatis as a cause for exclusion, (iii) existence of two parallel procedures for the optional exclusion of a partner within limited liability companies, one being through a court ruling and the other trough corporate a mere resolution; (iv) impossibility of treating the exclusion through corporate resolution as a form of judgment and, thus, the refusal of recognition of a r̈ight of defenseïn favor of the partner that is to be excluded...|$|R
