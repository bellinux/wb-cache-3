25|$|SQL Server also {{provides}} the optimistic concurrency control mechanism, {{which is similar}} to the multiversion concurrency control used in other databases. The mechanism allows a new version of a row to be created whenever the row is updated, as opposed to overwriting the row, i.e., a row is additionally identified by the ID of the transaction that created the version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>row.</b> Both the old as well as the new versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>row</b> are stored and maintained, though the old versions are moved out of the database into a system database identified as Tempdb. When a row {{is in the process of}} being updated, any other requests are not blocked (unlike locking) but are executed on the older version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>row.</b> If the other request is an update statement, it will result in two different versions of the rows—both of them will be stored by the database, identified by their respective transaction IDs.|$|E

25|$|This said, {{the actual}} {{mechanics}} of finding equilibrium cells is obvious: find the maximum of a column and check if the second {{member of the}} pair is the maximum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>row.</b> If these conditions are met, the cell represents a Nash equilibrium. Check all columns this way to find all NE cells. An N×N matrix may have between 0 and N×N pure-strategy Nash equilibria.|$|E

25|$|The {{characters}} are largely pictorial but include many abstract signs. The inscriptions {{are thought to}} have been mostly written from right to left (because there are several instances of the symbols being compressed on the left side, as if the writer was running out of space at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>row</b> there), but sometimes follow a boustrophedonic style. The number of principal signs is about 400. Since this is too large a number for each character to be a phonogram, it is taken that it must, instead, be a logo-syllabic script.|$|E
25|$|There {{is an easy}} {{numerical}} way {{to identify}} Nash equilibria on a payoff matrix. It is especially helpful in two-person games where players have more than two strategies. In this case formal analysis may become too long. This rule {{does not apply to}} the case where mixed (stochastic) strategies are of interest. The rule goes as follows: if the first payoff number, in the payoff pair of the cell, is the maximum of the column of the cell and if the second number is the maximum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>row</b> of the cell - then the cell represents a Nash equilibrium.|$|E

If there are no heirs, the house are returned to the village. This ideal pattern of succession is not always adhered to but {{it is expected that}} the most senior member of the extended family should dwell in the house at the uphill end.|$|E

Methods: The work is processed by a kinesiological analysis of selected movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rowing</b> stroke, based on <b>the</b> determination <b>of</b> muscle activation. Electromyography method was synchronized with the video recording. Results: Based on <b>the</b> sequences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> muscle activation was described their order and sequence in <b>the</b> actual shot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rowing</b> stroke (drive phase and recovery). We have proved that in the rigorous technical performance are always activated the same muscles in the exactly same order. Individual deviations from the correct technique in measuring appeared and thus enable their correction. Keywords: Electromyography, rowing, muscles, stroke...|$|R

25|$|Because Yarkoni was not Jewish, {{there was}} a problem with burying him in the Military Cemetery at Kiryat Shaul. (According to Orthodox Jewish burial law, Jews must be buried among Jews.) There was an outcry over the unseemliness of the {{impediment}} to burying a hero of the stature of Amos Yarkoni in a Military Cemetery. The matter was resolved quickly when Rehavam Zeevi, Yarkoni's lifelong friend and comrade, purchased a grave in the cemetery for himself, allowing Yarkoni to be buried at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>row,</b> and therefore technically not in the Jewish part of the cemetery.|$|E

25|$|Palmer's {{design for}} Nelson Place was a terrace of 23 houses, each 3 windows wide. The two end houses {{were to have}} ionic pilasters and the central houses were to have a pediment, {{identical}} to the facade of Norfolk Crescent. The terrace was to be completely level, but the ground slopes down towards the river (at the west end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>row)</b> so the street would have been built up on vaults, as {{at the south end}} of Norfolk Crescent. Each house was five storeys high (basement, ground floor, piano nobile, second floor and attic). Unlike many other Bath houses, the attic windows are in the main facade, not in the roof. This makes the building look taller and more impressive.|$|E
