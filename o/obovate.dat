5|$|The leaf {{blades of}} the summer rosettes of P. moranensis are smooth, rigid, and succulent, varying from bright yellow-green to maroon in colour. The laminae are {{generally}} <b>obovate</b> to orbicular, between 5.5 and 13centimeters (2–5in.) long and supported by a 1 to 3.5centimetre (⅜–1⅜in.) petiole.|$|E
5|$|A {{description}} of the species was published by Jacques Labillardière in his 1805 Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen, accompanied by a figure drawn by Pierre Antoine Poiteau and engraved by Auguste Plée. Labillardière chose the specific name obovata, {{in reference to the}} leaves of his specimen, which were <b>obovate</b> (egg-shaped, with the narrow end at the base). This leaf shape is often seen in this species. The term obovata derives from the Latin ob- ("inverse") and ovum ("egg"), and has feminine gender, consistent with the gender assigned by Labillardière to the genus.|$|E
5|$|Meissner placed B. lemanniana {{in series}} Quercinae in his 1856 {{arrangement}} of the genus on account of its strongly dentate, cuneate to <b>obovate</b> leaves. As they were defined on leaf characters alone, all of Meissner's series were highly heterogeneous. George Bentham published a thorough revision of Banksia in his landmark publication Flora Australiensis in 1870. In Bentham's arrangement, the number of recognised Banksia species was reduced from 60 to 46. Bentham defined four sections based on leaf, style and pollen-presenter characters. Banksia lemanniana was placed in section Orthostylis. In his 1891 work Revisio Generum Plantarum, German botanist Otto Kuntze challenged the generic name Banksia L.f., {{on the grounds that}} the name Banksia had previously been published in 1775 as Banksia J.R.Forst & G.Forst, referring to the genus now known as Pimelea. Kuntze proposed Sirmuellera as an alternative, republishing B.lemanniana as Sirmuellera lemanniana. The challenge failed, and Banksia L.f. was formally conserved.|$|E
5|$|Occurring {{in spring}} (August to October), {{the bright red}} or orange-red inflorescences are {{terminal}} and well displayed, and consist of anywhere from 10 to 52 individual flowers split into smaller groups of 2 to 20 flowers, arranged in a corymb. The flowers sit atop stalks (known as pedicels) up to 3.5cm (1.6in) in length, which arise in pairs off main horizontal stalks within the inflorescence. Each flower consists of a tubular perianth up to 4cm (1.8in) long, which partly splits along one side at anthesis to release the thick style. The stigma is contained within a slanting disc-like structure {{at the tip of}} the style. The tubular perianth splits into four segments at its tip, and the anther lies in the concave parts within each of these segments. The pedicel and the outer surface of the perianth are pubescent (covered in short fine fur). Flowers are followed by woody rectangular seed pods that sit on long stalks, and are 7–10cm (2.8–4in) long. Each pod contains 8 to 10seeds, and is ripe in February and March. Each seed is separated from the others by a membranous separator, and has a long rectangular wing, which is much longer than the seed itself. The seedlings have <b>obovate</b> cotyledons that are 0.8–1cm (0.3–0.4in) wide by 1cm (0.4in) long.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of terms are used to {{describe}} seed shapes, {{many of which are}} largely self-explanatory such as Bean-shaped (reniform) – resembling a kidney, with lobed ends {{on either side of the}} hilum, Square or Oblong – angular with all sides more or less equal or longer than wide, Triangular – three sided, broadest below middle, Elliptic or Ovate or <b>Obovate</b> – rounded at both ends, or egg shaped (ovate or <b>obovate,</b> broader at one end), being rounded but either symmetrical about the middle or broader below the middle or broader above the middle.|$|E
25|$|Growing to {{a height}} of up to , the Cornish Elm is a slender, slow-growing {{deciduous}} tree, distinguished by its long, straight trunk, which culminates in a narrow fan-shaped crown comprising short, straight, ascending branches. The leaves are small, <b>obovate</b> to oval, typically acuminate at the apex, 6cm long by 3.5cm broad, with a dark-green upper surface, glossy and smooth. The perfect apetalous wind-pollinated flowers occur in clusters of 1520 on very short pedicels. The samarae rarely ripened in England, but when mature were {{very similar to those}} of others in the Field Elm group, being mostly <b>obovate,</b> 16mm long by 10mm broad.|$|E
25|$|The {{leaf blade}} of a {{butterwort}} is smooth, rigid, and succulent, usually bright green or pinkish in colour. Depending on species, {{the leaves are}} between 2 and 30cm.(1-12") long. The leaf shape depends on the species, but is usually roughly <b>obovate,</b> spatulate, or linear.|$|E
25|$|B.ser. Quercinae {{was first}} {{published}} in 1856, in Carl Meissner's chapter on the Proteaceae in A. P. de Candolle's Prodromus systematis naturalis regni vegetabilis. It was one of four series into which the subgenus Eubanksia was divided. These four series were defined in terms of leaf characters, with series Quercinae containing the species with strongly dentate, cuneate to <b>obovate</b> leaves. As they were defined on leaf characters alone, all of Meissner's series were highly heterogeneous.|$|E
500|$|The <b>obovate</b> seed is [...] long, fairly flattened, has a papery {{wing and}} weighs around [...] The seed is {{composed}} of the <b>obovate</b> seed body (containing the embryonic plant) and measures [...] long by [...] wide.

500|$|Carl Meissner placed B.caleyi {{in series}} Quercinae in his 1856 {{arrangement}} of the genus on account of its strongly dentate, cuneate to <b>obovate</b> leaves. As they were defined on leaf characters alone, all of Meissner's series were highly heterogeneous. Meissner also described B.caleyi variety sinuosa from material collected by James Drummond, which was reviewed by Alex George and found to be {{no different from the}} other collections of B.caleyi. Drummond also collected material identified as B.caleyi that was named as a distinct species—Banksia aculeata—in 1981. No subspecies of [...] B.caleyi itself are recognised.|$|E
500|$|In his 1981 {{monograph}} The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae), Australian botanist Alex George placed B.sceptrum in B.subg. Banksia {{because its}} inflorescence {{is a typical}} Banksia flower spike shape, in B.sect. Banksia because of its straight styles, and in B.ser. Banksia because of its robust inflorescence and hairy pistil that is prominently curved before anthesis. He added that its follicles resembled those of Banksia ornata, while the [...] seed body resembled those of B. speciosa and B. baxteri, though its <b>obovate,</b> crinkled cotyledons suggested an affinity with the series Cyrtostylis.|$|E
500|$|Banksia lemanniana grows as an open shrub or, less commonly, a {{small tree}} to 5m (15ft) in height, with a {{spreading}} habit. The trunk has thin grey bark and can reach {{a diameter of}} 15cm (6in). Lower-growing plants that reach [...] in height have been reported from coastal areas of Fitzgerald River National Park. The new growth is finely hairy and predominantly seen in summer, before losing its hair and becoming glabrous (smooth) over two years. The stiff leaves are narrowly wedge-shaped or more oval (cuneate to <b>obovate)</b> and measure 3 to 9cm (1.2–3.6in) in length by 1.2–3.5cm (0.5–1.5in) wide. The leaf margins are serrated, with many teeth measuring 0.1 to 0.3cm each.|$|E
500|$|Flowering {{has been}} {{recorded}} between January and October, with a peak in autumn and early winter (April to June). The inflorescences, or flower spikes, arise {{from the end of}} 1 to 5year old branchlets, and often have a whorl of branchlets arising from the node or base. Measuring [...] high and [...] wide, the yellow spikes often have blue-grey tinged limbs in bud, though occasionally pinkish, mauve or mauve-blue limbs are seen. Opening to a pale yellow after anthesis, the spikes lose their flowers with age and swell to up to [...] high and [...] wide, with up to 80 follicles. Covered with fine fur but becoming smooth with age, the oval-shaped follicles measure [...] long by 0.2–0.7cm high (0.1–0.3in) and [...] wide. The bare swollen spike, now known as an infructescence, is patterned with short spiky persistent bracts on its surface where follicles have not developed. Each follicle contains one or two <b>obovate</b> dark grey-brown to black seeds sandwiching a woody separator. Measuring [...] long, they are made up of an oblong to semi-elliptic smooth or slightly ridged seed body, [...] long by [...] wide. The woody separator is the same shape as the seed, with an impression where the seed body lies next to it.

500|$|The {{tropical}} banksia {{is generally}} a small tree which grows to around [...] or sometimes [...] tall, with a rough stocky trunk, spreading crown, and crooked branches. The dark grey bark is not flaky but tesselated in texture and appearance. Initially covered in reddish hair that wears away, branchlets become smooth and grey with age. The large green leaves are scattered along the stems, and more crowded at the branchlet tips. They are [...] long and [...] wide, [...] in shape with [...] tips. The [...] (toothed) margins are lined irregularly with [...] long teeth, separated by u-shaped sinuses. The leaves are undulate (wavy) with white undersurfaces, the [...] raised underneath and depressed above.

500|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Calvatia craniiformis grow to {{dimensions}} of [...] tall by [...] wide, {{and have a}} form ranging from pear-shaped, to flattened-spherical, to <b>obovate</b> (roughly egg-shaped), to tunicate (like an inverted cone). At the bottom is a thick, often crumpled base attached to a cord-like rhizomorph, which is often encrusted with surrounding soil. The rhizomorphs are well developed, and when cut into longitudinal section, reveal three distinct tissues: an outer cortex, a subcortical layer, and a central core. The thin and fragile exoperidium (the outer layer of [...] "skin") is whitish-gray to gray, and initially smooth before becoming areolate (divided by cracks into discrete areas). The base extends up one-third to one-half way into the puffball (where it becomes the columnella) tapering to a point.

[...] Peduncles are wispy, with bell-shaped involucres measuring 3 to 7 millimeters, and they range from glabrous to short-haired. [...] Like all of its genus, P.bellidiflora has green phyllaries {{in two to three}} generally equal series, lanceolate to <b>obovate,</b> with margins widely scarious (dry and membranous), and a naked receptacle. [...] The yellow corollas are five-lobed, and each of the 16 to 38 disk shaped florets (per head) has linear, acute style tips. They may be slightly red-tinged underneath. [...] Fruits are 1.5 to 3.0 millimeters in diameter and are generally compressed in an oblong to [...] shape; they are typically covered with small hairs. [...] The plant presents fragile pappuses with five or fewer slender bristles, slightly expanded at the base. [...] Flowering season ranges from late March until late June. From a chromosomal standpoint, the species is diploid, (contains one set of chromosomes from each parent), and has 2n=18.|$|E

500|$|Banksia canei grows as a woody shrub to [...] in height, {{usually with}} many branches. Its bark is smooth with {{horizontal}} lenticels, initially reddish-brown before fading to grey tones. The stiff leaves are arranged alternately along the stems and show significant variation {{in shape and}} size. Adult leaves are linear or narrowly [...] in shape, and generally measure , though some populations have leaves as short as [...] or as long as [...] The juvenile leaves are generally larger and wider with [...] margins. New growth is seen mainly from February to April. The complex flower spikes, known as inflorescences, appear between December and May, peaking over February to April. [...] They arise from nodes of 1–3-year-old branchlets or can be terminal. Cylindrical in shape, they are composed of a central woody spike, from which {{a large number of}} compact floral units arise perpendicularly to it. They are generally [...] high and [...] wide, but some do reach [...] high. Mauve-tinted in bud, they generally open to become pale yellow in colour. As with most banksias, anthesis is the opening of the individual buds proceeds up the flower spike from the base to the top. The flower limbs may be pale grey or blue-tinged, while the styles are yellow. As the inflorescences age, the old flowers fall away, leaving a naked spike. Up to 150 follicles develop, each covered in short fine fur which is initially pale brown but fades to green-grey and partly wears away. More or less elliptic in shape, they measure [...] long, [...] high, and [...] wide, and mostly remain closed until burnt by fire, although a few may open after several years.

500|$|The corolla flares open {{into five}} lobes, two upper lobes and three lower lobes. The upper lobes are 7–16millimeters (¼–⅜in.) long by 4–9millimeters (–⅜in.) wide and {{generally}} oblong, <b>obovate,</b> or cuneate. The lower lobes are similarly shaped and are 7–20millimeters (¼–¾in.) long by 4–18millimeters (–¾in.) wide. The central lower lobe is usually slightly longer than its neighbors. All of the petal lobes have rounded ends. The floral tube {{that houses the}} reproductive organs and is visible {{at the base of}} corolla lobes is white or lilac in color and 4–6millimeters (–¼in.) long. The white color of the floral tube can extend to a variable distance onto the corolla lobes, particularly in a stripe on the lower middle lobe. The color of the corolla lobes generally varies from pink to purple, but has been described by collectors as being [...] "purple, scarlet, rosy-lavender to bluish-purple, dark pink to lavender, pinkish-purple, deep violet-purple, dark purple, bright mauve-pink, bright purple-pink, magenta with , [...] reddish pale with white eye." [...] A rare white-flowered form is also known.|$|E
500|$|P. moranensis is {{seasonally}} dimorphic, {{in that it}} undergoes {{two distinct}} growth habits throughout the year. [...] During the summer when rain and insect prey are most plentiful, the plant forms a ground hugging rosette composed of 6–8 generally <b>obovate</b> leaves, each up to 95millimeters (3¾in) long. These leaves are carnivorous, having a large surface area densely covered with stalked mucilaginous glands with which they attract, trap, and digest arthropod prey, most commonly flies. [...] These so-called [...] "summer leaves" [...] are replaced by [...] "winter rosettes" [...] of small, glandless succulent leaves {{with the onset of}} the dry season in October. [...] This protective winter rosette allows the plant to undergo winter dormancy until the first rains begin in May. [...] Flowers born singly on upright 10–25centimeters (4–10in.) peduncles emerge twice during the year (from the summer rosette and again from the winter rosette), a feature rare among the Mexican species. In the summer these appear in June, peak in August and September, and disappear with the return to the winter rosette in October or November.|$|E
500|$|When {{viewed in}} mass, as in a spore print, the spores {{generally}} appear yellow, although a Korean population {{with a light}} pink spore mass has been observed. Viewed with a light microscope, the spores are hyaline or pale yellow, elliptical, and visibly pitted. Electron microscopy or atomic force microscopy reveals the pits, or pores, to be an elaborate net-like structure called a reticulum. There are two to three such pores per micrometer, each approximately 400nanometers deep. Most spores are 14–20 by 6–9µm, but some may be as long as 24 or 28µm; specimens from a Korean population were reported with slightly smaller spores. Unlike others in the genus, C.cinnabarinum does not use nurse cells to supply food material to spores. The basidia are 40–50 by 15–20µm, broadly <b>obovate,</b> club-shaped or sometimes cylindrical, with five to twelve spores distributed evenly or irregularly over the surface. The gleba also contains branching hyphae, 3–4µm thick with frequent clamp connections. [...] The capillitium formed by these connections is present only when the mushroom is young and disintegrates thereafter.|$|E
500|$|The {{fruit body}} usually grows to a {{diameter}} of , although extremes of [...] and [...] have been reported. Its shape ranges from roughly spherical, to <b>obovate</b> (egg-shaped) or pyriform (pear-shaped), sometimes plicate (crumpled, wrinkled) around a somewhat fibrous, persistent tuft of mycelium. The puffball is initially covered by a thick, felted, whitish layer (the exoperidium). This is continuous at first but eventually cracks and peels away in thin flakes, exposing a leathery to corky, nearly smooth, light brown to dark pinkish-brown surface. This tough layer of tissue (the endoperidium) measures about 2mm thick, encloses the gleba. In maturity, the endoperidium opens by irregular splits that eventually extend towards the base in a star-shaped manner. These torn segments of endoperidium sometimes turn inside out, sometimes drying rigid, exposing a felt-like internal surface. The gleba is white when young and has a cheesy appearance and consistency. As the puffball matures, it undergoes a lytic process involving water loss. Subsequently, the gleba becomes olivaceous, olive-brown, and finally dark olive when dry, and then develops a characteristic pungent smell. Fruit bodies that grow underground have a conspicuously different morphology–a smooth, chocolate-brown coloured surface that lacks the patches characteristic of above-ground fruit bodies, and their capillitia are [...] with stumpy spines. The fungus is edible when the gleba is white. Its odor and taste {{have been described as}} pungent or earthy and its taste astringent.|$|E
500|$|The {{infructescence}} is small, {{with up to}} 20 small follicles concentrated at {{the lower}} end of the spike. Each follicle is [...] long, [...] high, and 2–3mm (c. 0.1in) wide and usually opens with fire. The [...] long seed is composed of the cuneate (wedge-shaped) seed body proper, measuring [...] long and [...] wide, and a papery wing. One side, termed the outer surface, is grey-black and wrinkled and the other—the inner surface—protrudes and is black and glistening. The seeds are separated by a dark brown seed separator that is roughly the same shape as the seeds with a depression where the seed body sits adjacent to it in the follicle. It measures [...] long and [...] wide. The dull green cotyledons of seedlings are [...] long and [...] wide, described by Alex George as [...] "cuneate to [...] ". Each cotyledon has a [...] auricle at its base. The thick, smooth hypocotyl is [...] high and 1.5mm thick. The seedling leaves are crowded above the cotyledons and linear to spathulate in shape, with recurved and deeply serrated margins with v-shaped sinuses, almost dividing the leaves into triangular lobes. The first pair are [...] long, with the next 2–4 leaves up to [...] long. Successive leaves are more <b>obovate</b> in shape and up to [...] long and [...] wide. The seedling stems are covered in white hair.|$|E
500|$|Depending on {{the variety}} and time of year, lettuce {{generally}} lives 65–130 days from planting to harvesting. Because lettuce that flowers (through the process known as [...] "bolting") becomes bitter and unsaleable, plants grown for consumption are rarely allowed to grow to maturity. Lettuce flowers more quickly in hot temperatures, while freezing temperatures cause slower growth and sometimes damage to outer leaves. Once plants move past the edible stage, they develop flower stalks up to [...] high with small yellow blossoms. Like {{other members of the}} tribe Cichorieae, lettuce inflorescences (also known as flower heads or capitula) are composed of multiple florets, each with a modified calyx called a pappus (which becomes the feathery [...] "parachute" [...] of the fruit), a corolla of five petals fused into a ligule or strap, and the reproductive parts. These include fused anthers that form a tube which surrounds a style and [...] stigma. As the anthers shed pollen, the style elongates to allow the stigmas, now coated with pollen, to emerge from the tube. The ovaries form compressed, <b>obovate</b> (teardrop-shaped) dry fruits that do not open at maturity, measuring 3 to 4mm long. The fruits have 5–7 ribs on each side and are tipped by two rows of small white hairs. The pappus remains at the top of each fruit as a dispersal structure. Each fruit contains one seed, which can be white, yellow, gray or brown depending on the variety of lettuce.|$|E
500|$|Banksia aemula is {{generally}} a gnarled shrub or small tree to , although usually smaller. Conversely, individual wallum banksias have been measured at [...] high, {{with a maximum}} diameter at breast height of [...] in forest on North Stradbroke Island. The trunk has thick orange-brown wrinkled and warty bark, and the new growth is hairy but becomes smooth as it ages. [...] New shoot growth is in spring and summer. The shiny green leaves are <b>obovate</b> to oblong in shape and measure [...] in length, and [...] in width. The leaf ends are truncate and the margins flat and serrated. Flowering is in autumn, from March to June; the green-yellow flower spikes, known as inflorescences, are terminal, found {{on the ends of}} branches and emerging from the foliage. Measuring [...] in height and [...] in width, they are various shades of pale and greenish yellow. [...] Anywhere from 800 to 1700 individual small flowers arise from a central woody spike (or rachis). Initially tipped with white conical pollen presenters, the flowers open sequentially from the bottom {{to the top of the}} flower spike over one to two weeks, in a process known as sequential anthesis. Each flower produces nectar for around seven days after opening. The flower spikes turn grey as they age and up to 25 finely furred grey follicles appear, which can be very large, measuring [...] long, [...] high, and [...] wide. They split open either after bushfire or spontaneously, and release oval seeds [...] in length, composed of a wedge-shaped body [...] long and [...] wide, and curved wing [...] wide. Banksia aemula resprouts from its woody lignotuber after fire.|$|E

They are a smooth shiny green above and white below with a prominent [...] covered in red-brown hair. The brownish new growth appears in summer. The plant is in bloom from March to June. Flowers occur in Banksia characteristic vertical flower spike, an inflorescence {{made up of}} hundreds of pairs of flowers densely packed in a spiral around a woody axis. B.aquilonia flower spike is a pale yellow colour, roughly cylindrical, [...] high, and up to [...] in diameter. The tubular perianths of the individual flowers are [...] long. These open at maturity (anthesis) to release the styles. All old flower parts fall away as up to 50 oval follicles develop on the bare woody spike. The follicles measure [...] long, [...] high, and [...] wide. Furry at first, they become smooth with age and open when ripe, and their two half-oval valves split to release {{the one or two}} seeds they contain. The [...] dark grey-brown to black seeds sandwich a woody separator. Measuring [...] long, they are made up of a wedge-shaped seed body, [...] long by [...] wide. The woody separator is the same shape as the seed, with an impression where the seed body lies next to it. Seedlings have bright <b>obovate</b> green cotyledons around [...] long. Juvenile leaves are narrower, measuring [...] long and [...] wide, and often have serrate (toothed) margins.|$|E
500|$|Banksia scabrella grows as a low shrub to 2m (7ft) {{in height}} and 3m (10ft) across, with a {{spreading}} habit. Its lateral branches are low and often {{rest on the}} ground. The small linear leaves measure 0.8 to 2.8cm in length and 0.1cm in width and are crowded along the stems. George recorded flowering as occurring in spring and summer (September to January), but The Banksia Atlas recorded the species in bloom in April. Flowers occur in [...] "flower spikes", or inflorescences, made up of hundreds of small flowers, or florets, densely packed around a woody axis. Quite conspicuous, they are terminal (occurring {{on the ends of}} branches) or on short side branchlets. Round or oval in shape, the cream or tan inflorescences are 3 to 6cm (1.2–2.4in) high and 7–9cm (2.8–3.6in) wide. The individual flowers are light yellow or cream, with the styles and upper floral parts purple. The perianths measure 2.7 to 3.5cm (1–1.6in), while the pistils 3.4 to 4.5cm (1.6–1.8in) in length and are curved at the apex. The inflorescences fade to grey as they age and the old flowers do not fall off. Up to 80 follicles develop on one spike, and remain closed until opened after a bushfire. Oval-shaped, they measure 1.8–2.8cm (0.7–1.1in) in length, by 0.5–0.9cm (0.2–0.4in) high, and 0.6–0.8cm (0.2–0.3in) wide. They open to release a dark brown oval seed 1.3–1.5cm (0.5–0.6in) long, 0.4–0.5cm (0.2in) wide with a papery dark 'wing' 1.4–2.4cm (0.6–1in) wide. Seedlings have narrowly <b>obovate</b> bright green cotyledons 1.2–1.4cm (0.5–0.6in) long by 0.3–0.4cm (0.1–0.2in) wide, and the leaves which develop immediately afterward are linear and scattered, and the stem is hairy.|$|E
500|$|The complex flower spikes, {{known as}} inflorescences, appear {{generally}} from late summer to early winter (February to June) in New South Wales and Victoria, although flowering occurs in late autumn and {{winter in the}} Gibraltar Range. Cylindrical in shape, they are composed of a central woody spike or axis, perpendicularly from which {{a large number of}} compact floral units arise, which measure [...] tall and [...] wide. Pale yellow in colour, they are composed of up to 1000 individual flowers (784 recorded in the Gibraltar Range) and arise from nodes on branchlets that are at least three years old. Sometimes two may grow from successive nodes in the same flowering season. They can have a grey or golden tinge in late bud. As with most banksias, anthesis is the opening of the individual buds proceeds up the flower spike from the base to the top. Over time the flower spikes fade to brown and then grey, and the old flowers generally persist on the cone. The woody follicles grow in the six months after flowering, with up to 150 developing on a single flower spike. In many populations, only a few follicles develop. Small and elliptic, they measure [...] long, [...] high, and [...] wide. In coastal and floodplain populations, these usually open spontaneously and release seed, while they generally remain sealed until burnt by fire in plants from heathland and montane habitats. Each follicle contains one or two fertile seeds, between which lies a woody dark brown separator of similar shape to the seeds. Measuring [...] in length, the seed is egg- to wedge-shaped ( [...] to [...] ) and composed of a dark brown [...] wide membranous [...] "wing" [...] and wedge- or sickle-shaped (cuneate–) seed proper which measures [...] long by [...] wide. The seed surface can be smooth or covered in tiny ridges, and often [...] The resulting seedling first grows two <b>obovate</b> cotyledon leaves, which may remain for several months as several more leaves appear. The cotyledons of Banksia marginata, B.paludosa and B.integrifolia are very similar in appearance.|$|E
