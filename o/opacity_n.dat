40|$|Abstract Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) findings in patients diagnosed with metastatic pulmonary calcification (MPC). Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the HRCT findings from 23 cases of MPC [14 men, 9 women; mean age, 54. 3 (range, 26 - 89) years]. The patients were examined between 2000 and 2014 in nine tertiary hospitals in Brazil, Chile, and Canada. Diagnoses were established by histopathologic study in 18 patients and clinical-radiological correlation in 5 patients. Two chest radiologists analyzed the images and reached decisions by consensus. Results: The predominant HRCT findings were centrilobular ground-glass nodules (n = 14; 60. 9 %), consolidation with high attenuation (n = 10; 43. 5 %), small dense nodules (n = 9; 39. 1 %), peripheral reticular opacities associated with small calcified nodules (n = 5; 21. 7 %), and ground-glass opacities without centrilobular ground-glass nodular <b>opacity</b> (<b>n</b> = 5; 21. 7 %). Vascular calcification within the chest wall was found in four cases and pleural effusion was observed in five cases. The abnormalities were bilateral in 21 cases. Conclusion: MPC manifested with three main patterns on HRCT, most commonly centrilobular ground-glass nodules, often containing calcifications, followed by dense consolidation and small solid nodules, most of which were calcified. We also described another pattern of peripheral reticular opacities associated with small calcified nodules. These findings should suggest the diagnosis of MPC in the setting of hypercalcemia...|$|E
40|$|Purpose Compare the {{effectiveness}} of Phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) in treatment corneal dystrophies versus superficial corneal scars: visual outcomes, recurrence rate and safety profile. Methods PTK was performed in 51 eyes of 51 patients. Data regarding the indications for PTK, ablation depth, symptomatic relief, pre-and postoperative best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA), spherical equivalent changes, recurrence and complications were analyzed. The indications for PTK in our study were classified into two categories – group A: patients with corneal dystrophies (n = 23) and the other group B (n = 28) with other indications. Results The {{average age of the}} patients was 47 years (± 16. 4). The mean follow up period was 15. 16 months (± 10. 01 months). Post operatively, there were no significant complications. While the overall BSCVA in the patients improved from 20 / 41 (0. 484) to 20 / 32 (0. 645), group A showed improvement from 20 / 35 (0. 561) to 20 / 29 (0. 687), as compared to group B in which BSCVA improved from 20 / 47 (0. 421) to 20 / 33 (0. 611). The most common indication in group A was granular corneal dystrophy (n = 10) and the most common indication in group B was post traumatic/infectious corneal scar or <b>opacity</b> (<b>n</b> = 10). Eighty-six percent (n = 44) of all patients had alleviation of symptoms. Recurrence of symptoms was seen in 3 eyes of recurrent corneal erosions which required retreatment. Conclusion PTK is a safe and effective procedure. The outcome of this study suggests that PTK improves BSCVA. PTK appears to improve ocular surface health. Furthermore, PTK can be recommended to most patients with corneal dystrophies as a treatment modality prior to other more invasive procedure (viz. penetrating keratoplasty) ...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To prospectively {{evaluate}} if {{findings on}} paired inspiratory and expiratory thin-section computed tomographic (CT) scans {{in patients with}} silicosis correlate with pulmonary function test results. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval and patient consent were obtained. Thirty-seven men (mean age, 71 years; range, 53 - 88 years) with silicosis were included. All patients had undergone inspiratory and expiratory thin-section CT and spirometry. Silicotic nodules, large opacity, emphysema, reticular opacities, bronchiectasis, and air trapping were graded subjectively on CT images. Emphysema was quantified on these images with built-in software. CT numbers were correlated with spirometric findings by using Spearman rank correlation analyses. Ten healthy volunteers (three men and seven women; mean age, 58 years) served as control subjects. RESULTS: After exclusion of three patients with inadequate image quality, 34 patients (mean age, 70 years; range, 53 - 88 years) {{were enrolled in the}} study group. Spirometric values did not differ significantly between patients with simple (n = 20) and patients with complicated (n = 14) silicosis but were significantly lower in patients than in control subjects. CT findings included air trapping (n = 33), emphysema (n = 26), nodules (n = 32), bronchiectasis (n = 22), large <b>opacity</b> (<b>n</b> = 19), and reticulation (n = 5). The extent of both air trapping and emphysema correlated negatively with spirometric values; the air trapping score showed the strongest correlation (ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity [FVC]: rho = - 0. 632, P <. 001; forced expiratory flow at 50 % of the FVC: rho = - 0. 576, P =. 001). Silicotic nodule, large opacity, and bronchiectasis scores did not correlate with obstructive functional impairments. CONCLUSION: In comparison with the spirometric value, the extent of air trapping proved the best CT index in the assessment of obstructive derangement in workers with exposure to silica dust.

40|$|Objective: With {{changes in}} the {{predominant}} pathogenic factors in the new form of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a different pattern of CT findings may be expected. This study aimed to (1) describe CT findings in infants with BPD and (2) correlate the CT findings with lung function abnormalities. Study design and method: Retrospective review of 41 very low birthweight infants with BPD, who were referred for pulmonary investigations at between 10 and 20 months after birth because of persistent respiratory symptoms, and underwent CT and lung function tests. Results: None of the infants had normal CT findings. The most frequent abnormalities were hyperlucent areas (n = 36; 88 %), linear <b>opacities</b> (<b>n</b> = 39; 95 %), and triangular subpleural <b>opacities</b> (<b>n</b> = 26; 63 %). Bronchiectasis was not seen. None of the CT abnormalities correlated with the maximum expiratory flow at functional residual capacity (VmaxFRC). In contrast, increased number of subpleural opacities and limited linear opacities were associated with low FRC and longer duration of neonatal oxygen exposure. The numbers of triangular subpleural opacities also correlated with duration of mechanical ventilation. Conclusions: Despite advances in neonatal care, many CT findings in infants with BPD {{are similar to those}} observed in the pre-surfactant era, and are still associated with duration of supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation. The absence of bronchial involvement {{in the present study was}} the most strikin...|$|R

40|$|The {{scarcity}} of fossil energy resources {{in conjunction with}} increasing demand has recently created record commodity price rises. Global warming and dimming {{are some of the}} harmful effects of increasing use of this resource. Furthermore, fossil fuel exhaust emissions, produced in internal combustion engines (ICE), generate significant health concerns. For decades, fears and numerous alarms have been raised regarding these problems. Many researchers believe that hydrogen would be an ideal alternative solution. Reduced fossil fuel consumption and lower thermal emanations (CO, CO 2, HC and NO) are expected if hydrogen is used, as a principal or supplementary fuel, in standard ICE’s. However, hydrogen dual-fuel use has historically been associated with injection and/or detonation problems. Direct injection (DI) strategy, in spark and compression engines, is commonly used to overcome some, but not all, of these difficulties. This experimental research investigated detonation free, diesel-hydrogen fuel consumptions, and exhaust emissions using an indirect injection (IDI) strategy in a generic compression diesel engine. A novel analogue Mechatronic Injection Unit (MICU) in conjunction with a multi point injection tactic (MPI) were devised to indirectly deliver low pressure hydrogen to a stationary Lister-Pitter diesel engine combustion chamber. The hydrogen injection system was created {{to be used as a}} generic dual-fuel kit. With off-the-shelf parts the MICU design was simple, robust, and purposeful in its function. The MICU component also formed an important element of a proposed innovative dual-fuel conversion kit. Nine hydrogen injection rates were tested. Diesel consumption savings were measured and the ‘effectiveness’ of hydrogen vitiated injection was computed. The research outcomes demonstrated that with a conventional diesel mechanical governor and an assumed engine compression ratio of 15. 5, detonation free combustion can be achieved with low pressure hydrogen vitiation and enrichment. However, an injection rate limit existed above which detonation occurred. The study also demonstrated that through low pressure hydrogen vitiation and enrichment, diesel consumption savings were achieved. The research confirmed that the experimental fuel mass savings were lower than their expected/theoretical counterparts. The research particularly established that vitiation and enrichment effectiveness was only realised at low rather than high loads indicating that hydrogen achieved more than diesel mass substitutions. In this study a new confined area dual-fuel static emission testing procedure, coupled with an on-site use test cycle was proposed and termed the Dual-fuel fixed speed emission-testing guideline. Dry thermal emissions were measured, and both the cycle average and median dry- and wet-emissions were computed, substance/species comparisons were performed and conclusions were drawn. The shortcomings of the procedure however were also highlighted. Finally, the research established that one action or measure, such as dual-fuel hydrogen vitiation and enrichment, can not address all the environment and health concerns. Contrary to the common belief, green house gases, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons and opacity substances do not coincidently all increase and/or decrease. Indeed, this experiment demonstrated that although the diesel-hydrogen nitrogen monoxide (NO) wet-emissions at all injection rates were partially lower than the diesel baseline, carbon oxides, hydrocarbon emissions, <b>opacity</b> (<b>N)</b> and absorption coefficients (k) were higher. In other words, a measure taken to limit the harm done to human health can increase the damage to the environment and vice versa...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{assess the}} {{usefulness}} of high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the lungs in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with and without respiratory symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHODS [...] Eighty eight RA patients with a mean duration of disease 12 (SD 8) years were evaluated. Eleven patients {{were excluded because of}} previous exposure to silica. The 77 remaining patients formed two groups according to the absence (group I, n = 38) or the presence (group II, n = 39) of chronic respiratory symptoms. A control group consisted of 51 non-smoking, healthy patients. RESULTS [...] The most frequent abnormalities observed in the 77 RA patients were bronchiectasis or bronchiolectasis (n = 23, 30 %), pulmonary nodules (n = 17, 22 %), subpleural micronodules or pseudoplaques (n = 13, 17 %), ground glass <b>opacities</b> (<b>n</b> = 11, 14 %), and honeycombing (n = 8, 10 %). Bronchiectasis or bronchiolectasis (p = 0. 012), rounded opacities (p = 0. 016), ground glass attenuation (p = 0. 004), and honeycombing (p = 0. 002) were found more often in RA group II (with respiratory symptoms) than in group I (no respiratory symptoms). Non-linear septal opacities were more frequent in group I than in the control group, but other HRCT findings did not differ statistically significantly between group I and the control group. CONCLUSION [...] Bronchiectasis may be a characteristic lung change in RA patients. Abnormalities on HRCT are less frequently observed in the absence of respiratory symptoms than in the presence of such symptoms (29 % versus 69 %) ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE. The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{high-resolution}} CT (HRCT) findings at presentation and after hospital admission in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). MATERIALS AND METHODS. We reviewed the HRCT findings at presentation (n = 12) and after hospital admission (n = 25) of 29 patients with SARS and compared the HRCT findings with the radiographic findings. HRCT scans were obtained using 1 -mm (n = 28) or 2 -mm (n = 1) collimation. The radiographs and HRCT scans were reviewed independently by two observers who reached a decision by consensus, RESULTS. All patients had abnormal findings on HRCT at presentation. Eight of these 12 patients had normal findings on radiographs. The predominant HRCT findings at presentation consisted of unilateral (n = 6) or bilateral (n = 2) ground-glass opacities or focal unilateral (n = 2) or bilateral (n = 2) areas of consolidation. All patients showed progression of disease on follow-up. The predominant HRCT findings on follow-up CT scans consisted of unilateral (n = 2) or bilateral ground-glass <b>opacities</b> (<b>n</b> = 13), unilateral (n = 2) or bilateral consolidation (n = 5), or a mixed bilateral pattern of ground-glass attenuation, consolidation, and reticulation (n = 3). Reticulation with associated architectural distortion and mild traction bronchiectasis was present in eight patients. CONCLUSION. HRCT can show parenchymal abnormalities in patients with SARS who have normal findings on radiographs at presentation.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: The drug (131) I-labeled lipiodol {{is used as}} {{internal}} radiotherapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Although {{the drug}} was considered safe during preapproval studies, we observed several cases of interstitial pneumonia following its administration. METHODS: Cases were retrospectively identified through the drug safety unit database of Rennes University Hospital. RESULTS: From 1994 to 2009, interstitial pneumonia developed in 15 patients following (131) I-labeled lipiodol administration, with an estimated prevalence of 15. 5 cases (95 % CI, 7. 7 - 23. 2) per 1, 000 treated patients. Mean age of the patients was 60 ± 8 years, and the male to female ratio was 6. 5 : 1. All patients had cirrhosis, mainly related to long-term alcohol intoxication (n = 12). Most (n = 10) cases occurred after the second (131) I-labeled lipiodol injection. The median delay between last (131) I-labeled lipiodol administration and first respiratory symptoms was 30 days (interquartile range, 16. 5 - 45 days). All patients presented with shortness of breath. Physical examination mostly revealed fever (n = 11) and bilateral crackles (n = 12). Chest CT scan showed bilateral ground-glass <b>opacities</b> (<b>n</b> = 8) with septal thickening, retraction, or both (n = 8). BAL (n = 7) was remarkable for increased neutrophils (n = 4) or CD 8 (+) T cell count (n = 3). Despite corticosteroids, 12 (80 %) patients died, mostly of untractable respiratory failure (n = 9). Median delay between last (131) I-labeled lipiodol injection and death was 63 days (interquartile range, 34 - 129 days).

40|$|Objective: {{the aim of}} {{this study}} was to assess the {{high-resolution}} computed tomography (HRCT) findings at presentation in patients diagnosed with Influenza A (H 1 N 1) virus-associated pneumonia. Materials and methods: We reviewed the HRCT findings from 20 patients diagnosed with Influenza A (H 1 N 1) and compared their HRCT scans with chest radiographs, obtained on the same day. the imaging studies were obtained 4 - 9 days after the onset of symptoms. the patients included 11 men and 9 women (ages 24 - 62 years; mean 42. 7 years). All patients had a body temperature greater than 100. 4 degrees F (> 38 degrees C), tachypnea, and cough. Other common symptoms included diarrhea (60 %) and sore throat (30 %). the radiographs and HRCT scans were reviewed independently by two observers who reached a consensus decision. Results: the predominant HRCT findings consisted of bilateral ground-glass <b>opacities</b> (<b>n</b> = 12), bilateral areas of consolidation (n = 2), or a mixed bilateral pattern of ground-glass opacities and areas of consolidation (n = 6). the abnormalities were bilateral in all of the 20 patients, had a predominantly sub-pleural distribution in 13 patients, and had a random distribution in the remaining 7 patients. the predominant radiographic findings were consolidations. Normal radiographs were found in 4 out of the 20 patients. Conclusion: HRCT may reveal parenchymal abnormalities in patients with Influenza A (H 1 N 1) infection who have normal findings on radiographs. the predominant HRCT findings were bilateral, peripheral, ground-glass opacities and/or bilateral areas of consolidation. the patients who presented consolidations had more severe clinical course.

40|$|Objectives: {{the purpose}} of this study was to {{evaluate}} high-resolution CT findings in 7 patients with Churg-Strauss syndrome and to compare the CT with the histopathologic findings. Materials and Methods: High-resolution CT scans of 7 asthmatic patients (4 women, 3 men, age range, 34 - 62 years, mean 49 years) with Churg-Strauss syndrome were reviewed by 2 observers. Histologic specimens of lung obtained at surgical (n = 3) or transbronchial (n = 3) biopsy or autopsy (n = 1) were reviewed by an expert lung pathologist. the diagnosis of Churg-Strauss was based on clinical, laboratory, and histologic findings. Results: Parenchymal and airway abnormalities included ground-glass <b>opacities</b> (<b>n</b> = 5), areas of air-space consolidation (n = 4), centrilobular nodules (n = 5), nodules 1 - 3 cm in diameter (n = 3), interlobular septal thickening (n = 4), bronchial wall thickening in = 4), and areas of atelectasis (n = 1). Surgical biopsy (n = 3) and autopsy (n = 1) specimens demonstrated airspace disease in 3 patients, interlobular septal thickening in 3 patients, and airway abnormalities in 2 patients. Histologically, the airspace disease included eosinophilic pneumonia (n = 2) and small foci of organizing pneumonia (n = 1). the septal thickening was due to edema combined with numerous (n = 2) or few (n = 1) eosinophils. the airway abnormalities (n = 2) included muscle hypertrophy and large airway wall necrosis (n = 1) and eosinophilic infiltration of the airway walls (n = 1). Transbronchial biopsy (n = 3) demonstrated increased eosinophils. Conclusion: the main high-resolution CT findings of Churg Strauss syndrome consist of airspace consolidation or ground-glass opacities, septal lines, and bronchial wall thickening. These reflect the presence of eosinophilic infiltration of the airspaces, interstitium, and airways, and interstitial edema.

40|$|Abstract. Accretion disk outbursts, {{and their}} {{subsequent}} decline, offer {{a unique opportunity}} to constrain the physics of angular momentum transport in hot accretion disks. Recent work has centered on the claim by Cannizzo et al. that the exponential decay of luminosity following an outburst in black hole accretion disk systems is only consistent with a particular form for the dimensionless viscosity, α = 35 (cs/rΩ) 3 / 2. This result can be understood in terms of a simple model of the evolution of cooling fronts in accretion disks. In particular, the cooling front speed during decline is ∼ αFcs,F (cs,F/rΩ) n, where F denotes the position of the cooling front, and the exact value of n depends on the hot state <b>opacity,</b> (although generally <b>n</b> ≈ 1 / 2). Setting this speed proportional to r constrains the functional form of α in the hot phase of the disk, which sets it apart from previous arguments based on the relative durations of outburst and quiescence. However, it remains uncertain how well we know the exponent n. In addition, more work is needed to clarify the role of irradiation in these systems and its effect on the cooling front evolution...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a new framework for modeling light interception by isolated trees {{which makes it}} possible to analyze the in uence of structural tree organization on light capture. The framework is based on a multiscale representation of the plant organization. Tree architecture is decomposed into a collection of components representing clusters of leaves at di erent scales in the tree crown. The components are represented by porous envelopes automatically generated as convex hulls containing components at a ner scale. The component <b>opacity</b> is de <b>ned</b> as the interception probability of a light beam going through its envelope. The role of tree organization on light capture was assessed by running di erent scenarii where the components at any scale were either randomly distributed or localized to their actual 3 D position. The modeling framework was used with threedimensional digitized fruit trees, namely peach and mango trees. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to assess the e ect of the spatial organization in each scale on light interception. This modeling framework {{makes it possible to}} identify a level of tree description that achieves a good compromise between the amount of measurement required to describe the tree architecture {{and the quality of the}} resulting light interception model.
