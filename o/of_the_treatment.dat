5|$|Another {{criticism}} is that outcomes {{are presented in}} terms of relative risk reduction to exaggerate the apparent benefits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatment.</b> For example, he writes, if four people out of 1,000 will {{have a heart attack}} within the year, but on statins only two will, that is a 50 percent reduction if expressed as relative risk reduction. But if expressed as absolute risk reduction, it is a reduction of just 0.2 percent.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin is an {{important}} part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> of those who have had a myocardial infarction (heart attack). One trial found that among those likely having an ST-segment elevation MI, aspirin saves the life of 1 in 42 by reducing the 30-day death rate from 11.8% to 9.4%. There was no difference in major bleeding, but there was a small increase in minor bleeding amounting to roughly 1 in every 167 people given aspirin.|$|E

5|$|Belgrano also {{experienced}} paludism (malaria) {{during the second}} campaign to Upper Peru. On 3 May 1815 he informed the government of his disease, which {{made it difficult for}} him to work or even talk. He was treated by doctor Joseph Readhead, who employed a local species of the Cinchona medicinal plant. The disease lasted up to his stay in Britain, when his health improved because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> and by having left the endemic zone.|$|E
5|$|Derogatory {{treatment}} {{must also}} have occurred in circumstances where the author {{has the right to}} be protected from it. The right to object to such treatment does not exist simply to protect damage, mutilation or the author's reputation. For literary, dramatic or musical works, the author is protected from derogatory treatment if the treatment is published commercially, performed in public or communicated to the public; he is also protected when a film or sound recording including the derogatory treatment is publicly issued. If the work is an artistic one, the author can sue when the derogatory treatment is commercially published or publicly exhibited, or when someone publicly shows a film or sound recording <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatment.</b> For films, the author is protected when the derogatory treatment is shown or communicated to the public, or when copies of it are issued to the public.|$|E
5|$|Experimental research: The {{researcher}} isolates {{a single}} social process and reproduces it {{in a laboratory}} (for example, by creating a situation where unconscious sexist judgements are possible), seeking {{to determine whether or}} not certain social variables can cause, or depend upon, other variables (for instance, seeing if people's feelings about traditional gender roles can be manipulated by the activation of contrasting gender stereotypes). Participants are randomly assigned to different groups that either serve as controls—acting as reference points because they are tested with regard to the dependent variable, albeit without having been exposed to any independent variables of interest—or receive one or more treatments. Randomization allows the researcher to be sure that any resulting differences between groups are the result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatment.</b>|$|E

5|$|In a large PSP (>50%), or in a PSP {{associated}} with breathlessness, some guidelines recommend that reducing the size by aspiration is equally effective as {{the insertion of}} a chest tube. This involves the administration of local anesthetic and inserting a needle connected to a three-way tap; up to 2.5liters of air (in adults) are removed. If there has been significant reduction {{in the size of}} the pneumothorax on subsequent X-ray, the remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> can be conservative. This approach has been shown to be effective in over 50% of cases. Compared to tube drainage, first-line aspiration in PSP reduces the number of people requiring hospital admission, without increasing the risk of complications.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the main}} methods of {{removing}} thallium (both radioactive and normal) from humans is to use Prussian blue, a material which absorbs thallium. Up to 20g per day of Prussian blue is fed by mouth to the person, and it passes through their digestive system and comes out in the stool. Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are also used to remove thallium from the blood serum. At later stage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> additional potassium is used to mobilize thallium from the tissue.|$|E

5|$|Quern stones: Quern {{stones were}} used in China at least 10,000 years ago to grind wheat into flour. The {{production}} of flour by rubbing wheat by hand took several hours. Due to their form, dimensions, and the nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> of the surfaces, they reproduce precisely the most ancient implements used for grinding cereal grain into flour. Saddle querns were known in China during the Neolithic Age but rotary stone mills did not appear until the Warring States Period. A prehistoric quern dating back to 23,000 BCE was found at the Longwangchan archaeological site, in Hukou, Shaanxi in 2007.

5|$|Since {{the reign}} of Edward IV (r. 1461–1470, 1471–1483), monarchs {{presented}} the diseased with a gold medal known as touch piece and hung it around the subject's neck.

The diseased were instructed to wear the medal constantly to ensure the success <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatment.</b> Not all people embraced the notion of the royal touch and miraculous medals; many were simply eager to obtain the medal, which was then sold on the market.|$|E

5|$|The person's {{understanding}} {{of his or}} her mental illness is evaluated by exploring his or her explanatory account of the problem, and understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> options. In this context, insight can be said to have three components: recognition that one has a mental illness, compliance with treatment, and the ability to re-label unusual mental events (such as delusions and hallucinations) as pathological. As insight is on a continuum, the clinician should not describe it as simply present or absent, but should report the patient's explanatory account descriptively.|$|E
