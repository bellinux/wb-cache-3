25|$|In abusive relationships, {{there may}} be a cycle of abuse during which {{tensions}} rise and an act <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> committed, followed by a period of reconciliation and calm. Victims of domestic violence may be trapped in domestic violent situations through isolation, power and control, cultural acceptance, lack of financial resources, fear, shame, or to protect children. As a result of abuse, victims may experience physical disabilities, chronic health problems, mental illness, limited finances, and poor ability to create healthy relationships. Victims may experience psychological problems, such as post-traumatic stress disorder. Children who live in a household with violence often show psychological problems from an early age, such as dysregulated aggression which may later contribute to continuing the legacy of abuse when they reach adulthood.|$|E
25|$|The city {{remained}} Ottoman {{until the}} empire's collapse, but was occasionally riven with internal feuds {{as well as}} attacks of cholera from 1823. Around 20–25 {{percent of the population}} died of plague in 1827. In 1850 a Muslim mob attacked Christian neighbourhoods, tens of Christians were killed and several churches looted. Though this event has been portrayed as driven by pure sectarian principles, Bruce Masters argues that such analysis of this period <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> too shallow and neglects the tensions that existed among the population due to the commercial favor afforded to certain Christian minorities by the Tanzimat Reforms during this time which played a large role in creating antagonism between previously cooperative groups of Muslim and Christians in the eastern quarters of the city. Janissary rebels installed their own government when the Ottoman governor fled. The Ottomans took over the city weeks later killing some 5,000. By 1901, the city's population was around 110,000.|$|E

40|$|<b>Violence</b> <b>is</b> {{an issue}} that is {{attracting}} increasing attention in the nursing literature. There is general agreement that nurses are exposed to unacceptable levels <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> and aggression in the workplace, and that levels <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>are</b> increasing. Despite this attention and awareness, however, violence does not have a standard definition, and theoretical explanations <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>are</b> seldom considered when discussing it in relation to nursing. This paper discusses current issues associated with defining violence, and presents an overview of some of the traditional and contemporary theories <b>of</b> aggression and <b>violence</b> in relation to nursing and the health context. Conflicting issues surrounding predictors and precipitators <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>are</b> examined. We explore the notion that <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> 'part <b>of</b> the job' in nursing. In conclusion, we assert that the current discourses on aggression and violence maintain the status quo, and argue that new explanatory positions on aggression and <b>violence</b> towards nurses <b>are</b> needed...|$|R

500|$|Indicators {{not already}} ranked on a 1 to 5 scale were {{converted}} {{by using the}} following formula: x=(x-Min(x))/(Max(x)-Min(x)) where Max(x) and Min(x) are the highest and lowest values for that indicator of the countries ranked in the index. The 0 to 1 scores that resulted were then converted to the 1 to 5 scale. Individual indicators were then weighted according to the expert panel's judgment of their importance. The scores were then tabulated into two weighted sub-indices: internal peace, weighted at 60% of a country's final score, and external peace, weighted at 40% of a country's final score. ‘Negative Peace’ which {{is defined as the}} absence of violence, or fear <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> used as the definition of peace to create the Global Peace Index. An additional aim of the GPI database is to facilitate deeper study of the concept of positive peace, or those attitudes, institutions, and structures that drive peacefulness in society. The GPI also examines relationships between peace and reliable international measures, including democracy and transparency, education and material well-being. As such, it seeks to understand the relative importance of a range of potential determinants, or [...] "drivers", which may influence the nurturing of peaceful societies, both internally and externally.|$|E
