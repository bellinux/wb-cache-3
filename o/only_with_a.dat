5|$|Although {{the case}} has not been {{formally}} overruled, two Supreme Court decisions in the 1970s and 1980s have undone its effect by ruling that there is federal subject-matter jurisdiction for a federal common law cause of action for recovering possession based on the common-law doctrine of aboriginal title. Moreover, the New York courts' interpretation of the Nonintercourse Act is no longer good law. Modern federal courts hold that only Congress can ratify a conveyance of aboriginal title, and <b>only</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> clear statement, rather than implicitly.|$|E

Throughout the game, various characters aid Link by giving or selling equipment and clues. These {{people can be}} found in caves scattered throughout the overworld; some are readily accessible, while others are hidden behind obstacles such as rocks, trees, and waterfalls.|$|E

5|$|In 1754, {{a stretch}} of road south of Altrincham, along the Manchester to Chester route, was turnpiked. Turnpikes were toll roads which taxed {{passengers}} {{for the maintenance of}} the road. Further sections were turnpiked in 1765 from Timperley to Sale, and 1821 from Altrincham to Stockport. The maintenance of roads passed to local authorities in 1888, although by then most turnpike trusts had already declined. The connection of the Bridgewater Canal to Altrincham in 1765 stimulated the development of market gardening, and for many years Altrincham was noted for its vegetables. By 1767, warehouses had been built alongside the canal at Broadheath, {{the first step in the}} development of Broadheath as an industrial area and the beginning of Altrincham's industrialisation. The canal was connected in 1776 to the River Mersey, providing the town not <b>only</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> water route to Manchester, but also to the Irish Sea.|$|E
5|$|In {{the night}} sky, Betelgeuse {{is easy to}} spot {{with the naked eye}} owing to its {{distinctive}} orange-red color. In the Northern Hemisphere, beginning in January of each year, it can be seen rising in the east just after sunset. By mid-September to mid-March (best in mid-December), it is visible to virtually every inhabited region of the globe, except for a few research stations in Antarctica at latitudes south of 82°. In May (moderate northern latitudes) or June (southern latitudes), the red supergiant can be seen briefly on the western horizon after sunset, reappearing again a few months later on the eastern horizon before sunrise. In the intermediate period (June–July) it is invisible to the naked eye (visible <b>only</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> telescope in daylight), unless around midday (when the Sun is below horizon) on Antarctic regions between 70° and 80° south latitude.|$|E
5|$|Other {{difficulties}} arose {{when the}} Empire's parliament, the General Assembly, opened in 1826. PedroI, {{along with a}} significant percentage of the legislature, argued for an independent judiciary, a popularly elected legislature and a government which would be led by the emperor who held broad executive powers and prerogatives. Others in parliament argued for a similar structure, <b>only</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> less influential role for the monarch and the legislative branch being dominant in policy and governance. The struggle over whether the government would be dominated by the emperor or by the parliament was carried over into debates from 1826 to 1831 on the establishment of the governmental and political structure. Unable to deal with the problems in both Brazil and Portugal simultaneously, the Emperor abdicated on behalf of his son, PedroII, on 7 April 1831 and immediately sailed for Europe to restore his daughter to her throne.|$|E

5|$|SMS Greif was an aviso {{built by}} the Imperial German Navy (Kaiserliche Marine), the only ship of her class. She was built at the Germaniawerft {{shipyard}} in Kiel; her keel was laid in 1885, she was launched in July 1886, and she was commissioned in July 1887. Unlike the other avisos built by Germany, Greif was equipped <b>only</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> gun armament. Greif served with the fleet from 1887 until 1911, though {{she was not a}} particularly successful design and so saw little active service, having spent most of her time in reserve. In 1912, she was reduced to a training ship for engine-room personnel. In 1917, she was hulked for minelayers in Kiel. She was ultimately sold for scrapping in 1921 in Hamburg.|$|E
5|$|The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle {{records that}} in 1097 King WilliamII ordered a wall {{to be built}} around the Tower of London; it was {{probably}} built from stone {{as a replacement for}} the timber palisade that arced around the north and west sides of the castle, between the Roman wall and the Thames. The Norman Conquest of London manifested itself not <b>only</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new ruling class, but in the way the city was structured. Land was confiscated and redistributed amongst the Normans, who also brought over hundreds of Jews, for financial reasons. The Jews arrived under the direct protection of the Crown, as a result of which Jewish communities were often found close to castles. The Jews used the Tower as a retreat, when threatened by anti-Jewish violence.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{advantages}} to charity status. Within English trusts law, a standard express trust has a relationship between the trustees and the beneficiaries; this does not apply to charitable trusts, partially because of the special definition of trustee used and partially because there are no individual beneficiaries identified in a charitable trust. Instead, the Attorney General of England and Wales sues on behalf of beneficiaries to enforce a charitable trust. Because of this lack of a relationship, the trustees' powers are far wider-ranging, only being regulated by the Charity Commission and actions brought by the Attorney General; the beneficiaries have no direct control. Charitable trusts are also exempt from many formalities when being created, including the rule against perpetuities. The trustees are also not required to act unanimously, <b>only</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> majority.|$|E

5|$|This is a concise work, {{in terms}} of its duration, the economy of {{thematic}} material presented, and also the narrow registers within which the four parts operate. The first movement is in 6/8 time and a monothematic sonata form. The development and recapitulation sections feature an example of Haydn's musical jokes. In this case he tinkers with the movement's sonata form by reference to an historical variation of it. The recapitulation starts <b>only</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> statement of the second phrase of the movement's theme, which is in the dominant. This would have been a common technique earlier in the eighteenth century that, in this instance, is liable to confuse the unknowing listener looking for the statement of the first phrase of the theme in the tonic. It is not until 27 measures later that the listener is presented with a more emphatic reprise, which is actually a coda. The coda involves the statement of the main theme in the tonic that the listener might have been expecting, and it does so after two measures of pointed silence.|$|E
5|$|Yet {{even as the}} Americans were {{attempting}} to clear the tunnels, heavy hand-to-hand fighting broke out above ground and Haldane was later awarded the Silver Star for his actions when he rushed a bunker while under fire armed <b>only</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> pistol, {{in order to give}} first aid to a number of wounded soldiers. His courage inspired his men to complete the assault, and ultimately helped ensure the successful evacuation of the casualties and the capture of their objective. That evening the battalions of US 3rd Infantry Brigade had completed searching their assigned area of operation, and the following morning they were withdrawn from the operation. The brigade's involvement in Crimp had been limited, losing six killed and 45 wounded, while 22 Viet Cong had been killed. It was subsequently redeployed on Operation Buckskin.|$|E
