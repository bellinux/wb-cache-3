Discount points are always used to buy down the interest rates, while origination fees sometimes are fees the lender charges for the loan or sometimes just another name for buying down the interest rate. <b>Origination</b> <b>fee</b> and discount points are both items listed under lender-charges on the HUD-1 Settlement Statement.|$|E
50|$|Private loans often {{carry an}} <b>origination</b> <b>fee,</b> {{which can be}} substantial. Origination fees are a {{one-time}} charge based {{on the amount of}} the loan. They can be taken out of the total loan amount or added on top of the total loan amount, often at the borrower's preference. Some lenders offer low-interest, 0-fee loans. Each percentage point on the front-end fee gets paid once, while each percentage point on the interest rate is calculated and paid throughout the life of the loan. Some have suggested that this makes the interest rate more critical than the <b>origination</b> <b>fee.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} link between {{mortgage}} <b>origination</b> <b>fees</b> and housing prices. It is argued that sharp decline in mortgage <b>origination</b> <b>fees</b> in US since the late 1980 s was caused by mortgage market deregulation and mortgage innovation. Based on this reasoning the sources of exogenous variation in mortgage fees are identified, {{and the effect of}} mortgage fees on housing prices is quantified. The results indicate that decline in mortgage fees had robust statistically significant positive effect on housing prices. The lagged effect of mortgage fees on housing prices is also present.

40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of {{securitization}} on two dimensions of consumer mortgage costs: coupon rates and loan <b>origination</b> <b>fees.</b> We find no evidence that securitization reduces the coupon rates on fixed- or adjustable-rate mortgages. Instead, securitization appears to lower mortgage loan <b>origination</b> <b>fees,</b> resulting in substantial savings for consumers. Securitization activity includes passthrough creation and collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) creation. We test for differences between the effects of passthrough and CMO creation on primary mortgage costs. Surprisingly, these activities appear to have indistinguishable effects on loan rates and <b>origination</b> <b>fees,</b> suggesting that a large derivatives market for mortgage loans is not creating value for consumers.

50|$|An {{activation}} fee is typically a set amount for any account. However, an <b>origination</b> <b>fee</b> usually varies from 3.0% to 10.0% {{of a given}} loan amount, {{depending on whether the}} loan was originated in the prime or the subprime market. For example, an <b>origination</b> <b>fee</b> of 3% on a $200,000 loan is $6,000. Discount points are used to buy down the interest rates, temporarily or permanently. Origination fees and discount points are both items listed under lender-charges on the HUD-1 Settlement Statement. Regulation Z was enacted to protect buyers from abusive lending practicing with regards to origination fees and origination fees for mortgages can not be deducted.|$|E

50|$|Investors {{make money}} from interest. Rates vary from 6.03% to 26.06%, {{depending}} on the credit grade assigned to the loan. Lending Club makes money by charging borrowers an <b>origination</b> <b>fee</b> and investors a service fee. The size of the <b>origination</b> <b>fee</b> depends on the credit grade and ranges to be 1.1%-5.0% of the loan amount. The size of the service fee is 1% on all amounts the borrower pays. The company facilitates interest rates that are better for lenders and borrowers than they would receive from most banks. It has averaged between a six and nine percent return to investors between its founding and 2013. However, because lenders are making personal loans to individuals on the site, their gains are taxable as personal income instead of investment income. Therefore, income from Lending Club loans may be taxed {{at a higher rate}} than investments that are taxed at the capital gains rate.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1997 Although {{previous}} {{studies have found that}} securitization reduces primary mortgage rates by 30 basis points or more, I find these benefits disappear when fixed and adjustable rate spreads are unbundled and measured separately. I find no evidence that securitization lowers primary mortgage spreads. Nor do I find evidence that tax and regulatory changes over the last 15 years have affected primary mortgage spreads. I find that securitization reduces loan <b>origination</b> <b>fees,</b> resulting in substantial savings for consumers. In 1993 alone, securitization produced consumer savings of more than $ 2. 8 billion in loan <b>origination</b> <b>fees.</b> This is the first study to test for differences between the effects of pass through and CMO creation on primary mortgage costs.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the factors that}} affect total, ongoing and <b>origination</b> <b>fees</b> of mortgages in Australia during the period 1996 to 2011. We find that banks charge significantly higher total and ongoing fees than mortgage corporations although they require lower <b>origination</b> <b>fees.</b> We also find that fee levels are dependent on loan size, loan-to-value ratio and loan features like term of the loan and presence of an offset account. Further, we confirm that lenders tradeoff higher (lower) interest rates with lower (higher) fee levels. Finally, our results show that mortgage fees are significantly affected by market conditionsGriffith Business School, Department of Accounting, Finance and EconomicsFull Tex...|$|R

50|$|To keep quoted {{interest}} rates {{as low as}} possible, institutions also often call for one-time origination or administration fees. However, an <b>origination</b> <b>fee</b> as low as 4% of the total loan can have a large impact on the borrower's total costs.
