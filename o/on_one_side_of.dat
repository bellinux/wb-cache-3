5|$|Burr {{was quickly}} called to Canada's Naval Services Headquarters {{to discuss how}} to apply {{diffused}} lighting camouflage. Simple tests in the laboratory served as proof of concept. In January 1941, sea trials began on the new corvette HMCS Cobalt. She was fitted with ordinary light projectors—neither designed for robustness, nor waterproofed—on temporary supports <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the hull; brightness was controlled manually. The trial was sufficiently promising for a better prototype to be developed.|$|E
5|$|Cerebral venous sinus {{thrombosis}} (CVST) is {{the presence}} of acute thrombosis (a blood clot) in the dural venous sinuses, which drain blood from the brain. Symptoms may include headache, abnormal vision, any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness of the face and limbs <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the body, and seizures. The diagnosis is usually by computed tomography (CT/CAT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) employing radiocontrast to demonstrate obstruction of the venous sinuses by thrombus.|$|E

5|$|Frith {{continued}} his exploration of folk and dance music {{on his next}} album for Ralph Records, Speechless (1981). As with Gravity, he recorded Speechless with two bands, French Rock in Opposition group Etron Fou Leloublan <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the LP, and Frith's New York City group Massacre on the other. The album included extensive tape manipulation, which was an ongoing passion of Frith's at the time.|$|E
5|$|Gravity was {{recorded}} in Sweden, the United States and Switzerland and featured Frith with Swedish Rock in Opposition group Samla Mammas Manna <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the LP, and Frith with United States progressive rock group The Muffins on the other side. Additional musicians included Marc Hollander from Aksak Maboul and Chris Cutler from Henry Cow.|$|E
5|$|Microdontia of {{a single}} tooth {{is more likely to}} occur in a maxillary lateral incisor. The second most likely tooth to have microdontia are third molars. Macrodontia of all the teeth is known to occur in {{pituitary}} gigantism and pineal hyperplasia. It may also occur <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the face in cases of hemifacial hyperplasia.|$|E

5|$|Obstruction {{of blood}} {{flow through the}} {{affected}} vessel may lead to dysfunction of {{part of the brain}} supplied by the artery. This happens in 77–96% of cases. This may be temporary ("transient ischemic attack") in 10–16% of cases, but many (67–85% of cases) end up with a permanent deficit or a stroke. The vertebral artery supplies {{the part of the brain}} that lies in the posterior fossa of the skull, and this type of stroke is therefore called a posterior circulation infarct. Problems may include difficulty speaking or swallowing (lateral medullary syndrome); this occurs in less than a fifth of cases and occurs due to dysfunction of the brainstem. Others may experience unsteadiness or lack of coordination due to involvement of the cerebellum, and still others may develop visual loss (<b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the visual field) due to involvement of the visual cortex in the occipital lobe. In the event of involvement of the sympathetic tracts in the brainstem, a partial Horner's syndrome may develop; this is the combination of a drooping eyelid, constricted pupil, and an apparently sunken eye <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the face.|$|E
5|$|<b>On</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the Ring {{is a large}} star, {{borrowed}} from the seal {{of the state of}} Texas. The oak leaves symbolize strength. On {{the other side of the}} Ring are a cannon, a saber, and a rifle, symbolizing Aggies' preparedness and valor in defending their land. The crossed flags of the United States and Texas symbolize allegiance to both nation and state.|$|E
5|$|The church's {{appearance}} in the mid-16th century, shortly before its completion, is known from a woodcut by Girolamo Franzini. Its facade appears almost square; at its center there was a portal with a tympanum, surmounted by a large fanlight opened by a round window. On its side were three rows of pilasters with two pairs of niches, one over the other. A bell-gable was <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the roof.|$|E

5|$|The {{equivalence}} between gravitational and {{inertial effects}} {{does not constitute}} a complete theory of gravity. When it comes to explaining gravity near our own location on the Earth's surface, noting that our reference frame is not in free fall, so that fictitious forces are to be expected, provides a suitable explanation. But a freely falling reference frame <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the Earth cannot explain why {{the people on the}} opposite side of the Earth experience a gravitational pull in the opposite direction.|$|E
5|$|The four {{throwing}} events generally all begin <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the stadium. The javelin throw typically {{takes place}} {{on a piece of}} track that is central and parallel to the straights of the main running track. The javelin throwing area is a sector shape frequently across the Pitch (sports field) {{in the middle of the}} stadium, ensuring that the javelin has a minimal chance of causing damage or injury. The discus throw and hammer throw contests begin in a tall metal cage usually situated in one of the corners of the field. The cage reduces the danger of implements being thrown out of the field of play and throws travel diagonally across the field in the centre of the stadium. The shot put features a circular throwing area with a toe board at one end. The throwing area is a sector. Some stadia also have a water jump area <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the field specifically for steeplechase races.|$|E
5|$|The one {{exception}} to black was No. 6234 Duchess of Abercorn which in 1946 was painted in a blue-grey colour. This represented the proposed post-war livery and the lining, painted <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the locomotive only, comprised a pale straw yellow line along the running plate with yellow and black edging to cab and tender. Lettering and numerals used a sans-serif font.|$|E

5|$|All around are pubs and brothels. The Earl of Cardigan tavern is <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the street, and {{opposite}} is the Rummer, whose sign shows a rummer (a short wide-brimmed glass) {{with a bunch}} of grapes on the pole. Masonic lodges met in both taverns during the 1730s, and the Lodge at the Rummer and Grapes in nearby Channel Row was the smartest of the four founders of the Grand Lodge. The publican is adulterating a hogshead of wine, a practice recalled in the poetry of Matthew Prior who lived with his uncle Samuel Prior, the Landlord successively of both the Rummer and Grapes and the Rummer".|$|E
5|$|Although {{aircraft}} {{flying over}} the Jisr ed Damieh to Beisan road, the Jisr ed Damieh bridge, Es Salt and Beisan as far as Tubas, reported all quiet at dawn {{on the morning of}} 20 September, RAF Bristol Fighters would later attack a convoy of 200 vehicles withdrawing from Nablus, blocking the road, causing many horses to bolt over a precipice <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the road while men scattered into the hills on the other side. The last reconnaissance on 20 September reported the whole Ottoman line alarmed, three large fires were burning at Nablus railway station and at the Balata supply dumps, while a brigade of British cavalry was seen entering Beisan.|$|E

5|$|Each Province is a two-sided {{interchangeable}} board, <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> {{which is}} a Harbinger's province while on the other are the sewers. The Provinces can be assembled in any order, which can allow different game experiences when the Provinces are changed. Each Province has its own headstone {{and is in the}} Harbinger's colours. Both sides of the Province board have paths used by the players to move around the board. Located along the paths are the six Keystones for that colour Province, and three different game symbols: the black holes, the lighting bolts and the compasses.|$|E
5|$|In September 1987, B-1B (s/n 84-0052) {{from the}} 96th Bomb Wing, 338th Combat Crew Training Squadron, Dyess AFB crashed near La Junta, Colorado while flying on a {{low-level}} training route. This {{was the only}} B-1B crash to occur with six crew members aboard. The two crew members in jump seats, {{and one of the}} four crew members in ejection seats perished. The root cause of the accident was thought to be a bird strike on a wing's leading edge during the low-level flight. The impact was severe enough to sever fuel and hydraulic lines <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the aircraft, the other side's engines functioned long enough to allow for ejection. The B-1B fleet was later modified to protect these supply lines.|$|E
5|$|Integer {{powers of}} 2 are {{important}} in computer science. The positive integer powers 2n give the number of possible values for an n-bit integer binary number, e.g. 28 = 256 different values for 1byte. For a given number the binary number system denotes <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the binary point all the positive integer powers of 2, that are contained in the integer part of this number, and the negative powers {{to the other side}} of the binary point represent the fractional part. This system is consistently used to represent numbers in computers for hardware reasons.|$|E
