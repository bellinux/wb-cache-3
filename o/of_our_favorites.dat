40|$|The {{echoes of}} the Beijing Olympics have been soundly drowned out, at least in US medialand, by the Democratic Convention. Even so, there’s {{still a lot of}} good and {{interesting}} coverage and reflections on the Beijing spectacle. Here are a few <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>favorites.</b> 1. For a variety of takes on the closing ceremony, see Danwei’s wrap-up. 2. In case you missed them, here are Xinhua’s pictures of a sweaty President Bushchatting with the eventual gold medalists in women’s beach volleyball. 3. Mary Beard at TLS wrote two recent pieces on the Olympics that may be of interest–both written from a classicist’s perspective, the first beginning from the premise of how London will possibly live up to Beijing’s show, while the second a tongue-in-cheek reflection on Greek Olympic traditions. 4. For those tracking superstitions in 2008 (like the earthquake premonitions and the Olympic harbingers of doom), Shanghaiist is keeping up on connections between the earthquake and the Chinese medal count. 5. After all the mentions in the media {{over the last few weeks}} of the massive mobilization of humans necessary for the Olympic performances (a mobilization made possible, commentators implied or sometimes said, because China is an autocratic regime), Jamie Metzl of the Asia Society urges in FEER that liberal democracies need to go toe-to-toe with Beijing’s technocrats and prove that liberal democracies can also put on a good show. (Is that the acrid smell of Cold War in the air?) At openDemocracy, Kerry Brown argues that the Olympics have already changed China in ways that matter.

40|$|This {{paper has}} {{attracted}} interest {{around the world}} from the media (both TV and newspapers). In addition, we have received letters, emails and telephone calls. One <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>favorites</b> was a voicemail message asking us to return a call to Australia at which point we would learn who really killed JFK. We welcome the opportunity to respond to the letter to the editor from Mr. Fiorentino. Mr. Fiorentino claims that our "statement relating to the likelihood of a second assassin based on the premise of three or more separate bullets is demonstrably false. " In response we would like to simply quote from page 327 of Gerald Posner's book Case Closed, one of the most well known works supporting the single assassin theory: "If Connally was hit by another bullet, it had to be fired from a second shooter, since the Warren Commission's own reconstructions showed that Oswald could not have operated the bolt and refired in 1. 4 seconds. " Mr. Fiorentino also claims that the "second fatal flaw is the use of a rather uncomplicated formula based on Bayes Theorem. " Let E denote the evidence and T denote the theory that there were just two bullets (and hence a single shooter). We used Bayes Theorem to hypothetically calculate P(T|E) from P(E|T) and the prior probability P(T). In order to make P(T|E) ten times more likely than P(T̅|E), the ratio of the prior probabilities [i. e., P(T) / P(T̅) ] would have to be greater than 15. Thus, we again conclude that this casts serious doubt on Dr. Guinn's conclusion that the evidence supported just two bullets. Sadly, this is far from the first time that probability has been misunderstood and/or misapplied in a case of public interest. A notable British example is the Clark case. See Nobles and Schiff (2005) for details. Finally, we welcome and, in fact, encourage members of the scientific community to provide alternative analyses of the data.
