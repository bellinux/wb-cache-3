5|$|Author Robert R. Frump {{wrote in}} The Man-eaters of Eden that Mozambican {{refugees}} regularly crossing Kruger National Park {{at night in}} South Africa are attacked and eaten by the lions; park <b>officials</b> <b>have</b> conceded that man-eating is a problem there. Frump believes thousands may {{have been killed in}} the decades after apartheid sealed the park and forced the refugees to cross the park at night. For nearly a century before the border was sealed, Mozambicans had regularly walked across the park in daytime with little harm.|$|E

5|$|Denver is a {{consolidated}} city-county with a mayor elected on {{a nonpartisan}} ballot, a 13-member city council and an auditor. The Denver City Council is elected from 11 districts with two at-large council-members and {{is responsible for}} passing and changing all laws, resolutions, and ordinances, usually after a public hearing, and can also call for misconduct investigations of Denver's departmental officials. All elected <b>officials</b> <b>have</b> four-year terms, with a maximum of three terms. The current mayor is Michael Hancock.|$|E
5|$|Even {{prior to}} the cost {{increases}} which plagued the design and construction of the tram, the project has been subject to criticism from the public. Many residents in the neighborhoods under the tram's route object to the tram's presence. The cost increases themselves, and the perceived machinations of public <b>officials,</b> <b>have</b> been controversial. Some consider the project an unworthy use of public funds at any price, either {{due to a lack}} of benefit for those not associated with OHSU, or due to opposition to such projects in general.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, the Russian {{government}} announced {{that all of}} its remaining smallpox samples would be moved to the Vector Institute in Koltsovo. With {{the breakup of the}} Soviet Union and unemployment of many of the weapons program's scientists, U.S. government <b>officials</b> <b>have</b> expressed concern that smallpox and the expertise to weaponize it may have become available to other governments or terrorist groups who might wish to use virus as means of biological warfare. Specific allegations made against Iraq in this respect, however, proved to be mistaken.|$|E

Under the F marque, Lexus plans to produce high-performance vehicles with its first expressions being the IS F and the LFA. Lexus <b>officials</b> <b>have</b> also discussed standard production model usage of varying platforms. The LS uses a dedicated platform, while the entry-level Lexus ES had {{been criticized for}} being too similar to the Toyota Camry, with which it shared platforms until its sixth generation, in both styling and powertrain design. The Nürburgring test track in Germany has also seen Lexus prototype testing.|$|E
5|$|Some {{truck drivers}} {{have used the}} pass despite the prohibition. They are {{generally}} either unaware of the restriction and following routes plotted by their GPS devices, or aware of it and willing to risk the fine {{for the sake of}} the time and distance saved. The resulting accidents have forced the closure of the pass. CDOT has put in larger signs advising drivers of the ban and worked with GPS device manufacturers so their software notes the restriction. Aspen <b>officials</b> <b>have</b> suggested the fines be increased as well.|$|E
5|$|The courier and a {{relative}} (who {{was either a}} brother or a cousin) {{were killed in the}} May 2, 2011 raid. Afterward, some locals identified the men as Pashtuns named Arshad and Tareq Khan. Arshad Khan was carrying an old, noncomputerized Pakistani identification card, which identified him as from Khat Kuruna, a village near Charsadda in northwestern Pakistan. Pakistani <b>officials</b> <b>have</b> found no record of an Arshad Khan in that area and suspect the men were living under false identities.|$|E

5|$|A slip ramp {{was also}} planned in 2000 {{to connect to}} Lafayette Street in Norristown {{as part of a}} {{revitalization}} plan for the community. The project would involve extending Lafayette Street to the new ramp. This proposed slip ramp is projected to cost $160 million. Montgomery County <b>officials</b> <b>have</b> proposed a surcharge for the new exit in {{to help pay for the}} project. Work on engineering and environmental approval for the interchange occurred in 2008, and acquisition of land began in 2011. On January 7, 2015, the turnpike commission committed $45 million to building this interchange. Construction on the interchange at Lafayette Street may begin as soon as 2018.|$|E
5|$|American {{economist}} and former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker {{has argued that}} the lack of global consensus on key issues threatens efforts to reform the global financial system. He has argued that quite possibly the most important issue is a unified approach to addressing failures of systemically important financial institutions, noting public taxpayers and government <b>officials</b> <b>have</b> grown disillusioned with deploying tax revenues to bail out creditors for the sake of stopping contagion and mitigating economic disaster. Volcker has expressed an array of potential coordinated measures: increased policy surveillance by the IMF and commitment from nations to adopt agreed-upon best practices, mandatory consultation from multilateral bodies leading to more direct policy recommendations, stricter controls on national qualification for emergency financing facilities (such as those offered by the IMF or by central banks), and improved incentive structures with financial penalties.|$|E
5|$|Human {{rights in}} Madagascar are {{protected}} {{under the constitution}} and the state is a signatory to numerous international agreements including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Religious, ethnic and sexual minorities are protected under the law. Freedom of association and assembly are also guaranteed under the law, although in practice the denial of permits for public assembly has occasionally been used to impede political demonstrations. Torture by security forces is rare and state repression is low relative to other countries with comparably few legal safeguards, although arbitrary arrests and the corruption of military and police officers remain problems. Ravalomanana's 2004 creation of BIANCO, an anti-corruption bureau, resulted in reduced corruption among Antananarivo's lower-level bureaucrats in particular, although high-level <b>officials</b> <b>have</b> not been prosecuted by the bureau.|$|E

5|$|In March 1994, the Washington Agreement was signed, {{ending the}} Croat–Bosniak War, and {{providing}} Croatia with US military advisors from the Military Professional Resources Incorporated (MPRI). The US involvement reflected a new military strategy endorsed by Bill Clinton in February 1993. Because the UN arms embargo {{was still in}} place, the MPRI was hired ostensibly to prepare the HV {{for participation in the}} NATO Partnership for Peace programme. They trained HV officers and personnel for 14 weeks from January to April 1995. It has also been speculated in several sources,including The New York Times and various Serbian media reports, that the MPRI may have provided doctrinal advice, scenario planning and US government satellite intelligence to Croatia. MPRI, American and Croatian <b>officials</b> <b>have</b> denied such claims. In November 1994, the US unilaterally ended the arms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina, allowing the HV to supply itself as arms shipments flowed through Croatia.|$|E
5|$|On July 11, 2009, CIA Director Leon Panetta {{told the}} Senate and House {{intelligence}} committees that the CIA withheld {{information about a}} secret counter-terrorism program from Congress for eight years on direct orders from Cheney. Intelligence and Congressional <b>officials</b> <b>have</b> said the unidentified program did not involve the CIA interrogation program and did not involve domestic intelligence activities. They have said the program was started by the counter-terrorism center at the CIA shortly after the attacks of September 11, 2001, but never became fully operational, involving planning and some training that took place off and on from 2001 until this year. The Wall Street Journal reported, citing former intelligence officials familiar with the matter, that the program {{was an attempt to}} carry out a 2001 presidential authorization to capture or kill al Qaeda operatives.|$|E
5|$|Rocks mined for {{phosphate}} fertilizers contain varying {{amounts of}} cadmium, {{resulting in a}} cadmium concentration {{of as much as}} 300mg/kg in the fertilizers and a high cadmium content in agricultural soils. Coal can contain significant amounts of cadmium, which ends up mostly in flue dust. Cadmium in soil can be absorbed by crops grown on the land such as in rice. Chinese ministry of agriculture <b>officials</b> <b>have</b> measured in 2002 that 28% of rice it sampled had excess of lead and 10% had an excess of cadmium above limited defined by law. Some plants such as willow trees and poplars have been found to clean both lead and cadmium from soil.|$|E
