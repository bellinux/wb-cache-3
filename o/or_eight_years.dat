5|$|As of June 2012, {{current issues}} {{do not reflect}} the {{expansion}} of the European Union, as Cyprus is not depicted on current notes as the map does not extend far enough east and Malta is also missing as it does not meet the current series' minimum size for depiction. Since the European Central Bank plans to redesign the notes every seven <b>or</b> <b>eight</b> <b>years</b> after each issue, a second series of banknotes is already in preparation. New production and anti-counterfeiting techniques will be employed on the new notes, but the design will be of the same theme and colours identical of the current series; bridges and arches. However, they would still be recognisable as a new series.|$|E
5|$|William faced several {{challenges}} on becoming duke, including his illegitimate birth and his youth: the {{evidence indicates that}} he was either seven <b>or</b> <b>eight</b> <b>years</b> old at the time. He enjoyed {{the support of his}} great-uncle, Archbishop Robert, as well as the king of France, Henry I, enabling him to succeed to his father's duchy. The support given to the exiled English princes in their attempt to return to England in 1036 shows that the new duke's guardians were attempting to continue his father's policies, but Archbishop Robert's death in March 1037 removed one of William's main supporters, and conditions in Normandy quickly descended into chaos.|$|E

5|$|Since LAGs can be obliterated by bone remodeling, this {{represents}} an underestimate {{of the true}} number of LAGs that had actually developed; McDonald and colleagues estimated three or four missing LAGs by examining the spacing between the visible LAGs. This indicates that the animal was eight to nine years old when it died. The spacing between the LAGs decreases significantly towards the outer surface, indicating that growth was slowing, {{but the lack of}} the external fundamental system (a series of tightly-spaced LAGs) indicates that growth had not yet ceased. This is consistent with the unfused sutures between the centra and neural spines in the cervical and dorsal vertebrae, and the unfused sutures between the sacral centra and their corresponding ribs. Overall, the growth rate of Eolambia appears to have been comparable to that of Hypacrosaurus and Maiasaura, which reached maturity after seven <b>or</b> <b>eight</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E

After Khubilai’s election as Khagan in 1260, Bolad served as ba’urchi, designer of court ritual, censor, and chief of the agricultural administration (in Mongolian style). In addition, he did oral and written translations for the state affairs as one of intellectuals of the Mongols.|$|E

25|$|Vytautas barely escaped alive, {{but many}} princes of his kin (including his cousins Demetrius I Starszy and Andrei of Polotsk) and allies (as for example, Stephen I of Moldavia {{and two of}} his brothers) died in the battle. It is {{estimated}} that some 50 princes fought under Vytautas' banners and about 20 of them were killed. The victorious Tatars besieged Kiev, but it paid a ransom. The Tatars pillaged as far west as Lutsk, in pursuit of Tokhtamysh, who spent the next seven <b>or</b> <b>eight</b> <b>years</b> in hiding and was assassinated in 1407 or 1408.|$|E

25|$|Nor {{does the}} {{painting}} use Diana as an allegorical portrait, a tradition for which had {{developed by the}} mid-17th century, with identifiable women depicted as the goddess, {{who was also a}} symbol of chastity.

While {{her mother and}} {{stepfather}} looked for work in another city, Lucy's stepfather’s parents cared for her brother and her. Ball's new guardians were a puritanical Swedish couple who banished all mirrors from the house except for one over the bathroom sink. When the young Ball was caught admiring herself in it, she was severely chastised for being vain. This period of time affected Ball so deeply that, in later life, she claimed that it lasted seven <b>or</b> <b>eight</b> <b>years.</b> Peterson was a Shriner.|$|E

This happened during the same year that Woody Allen was filming Sleeper, using NCAR in many of the futuristic background scenes that appeared in the movie.

25|$|After {{a series}} of bank {{failures}} devastated {{the economy of the}} upper Midwest, Dr. LaMoore and Emily took to the road. Removing Louis and his adopted brother John from school, they headed south in the winter of 1923. Over the next seven <b>or</b> <b>eight</b> <b>years,</b> they skinned cattle in west Texas, baled hay in the Pecos Valley of New Mexico, worked in the mines of Arizona, California and Nevada, and in the saw mills and lumber camps of the Pacific Northwest. It was in colorful places like these that Louis met a wide variety of people, upon whom he later modeled the characters in his novels, many of them actual Old West personalities who had survived into the nineteen-twenties and -thirties.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps Osler's {{greatest}} {{influence on}} medicine was {{to insist that}} students learn from seeing and talking to patients {{and the establishment of}} the medical residency. The latter idea spread across the English-speaking world and remains in place today in most teaching hospitals. Through this system, doctors in training make up much of a teaching hospital's medical staff. The success of his residency system depended, in large part, on its pyramidal structure with many interns, fewer assistant residents and a single chief resident, who originally occupied that position for years. While at Hopkins, Osler established the full-time, sleep-in residency system whereby staff physicians lived in the administration building of the hospital. As established, the residency was open-ended, and long tenure was the rule. Doctors spent as long as seven <b>or</b> <b>eight</b> <b>years</b> as residents, during which time they led a restricted, almost monastic life.|$|E
500|$|Propagation is {{generally}} by seed although semi-hardened cuttings {{have also been}} successful. Cuttings can be slow to strike, and the resulting plants may have weak root systems early on {{and need to be}} supported with stakes.

An alternative method used has been to graft mature scions onto young stock to combine a strong root system with material capable of flowering quickly. The species has also been considered as a rootstock for the considerably harder to grow A.pinnatum. Alloxylon flammeum has potential as a cut flower crop. Its soft silky timber resembles that of oak and is highly regarded.|$|E
