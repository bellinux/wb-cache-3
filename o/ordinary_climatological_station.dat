The ultraviolet (UV) {{atmospheric radiation}} (wavelength 0. 3 to 0. 4 um) is responsible of photochemical reactions {{such as the}} decomposition of plastics and color paintings, the ozone layer formation, the activation of bacteries and enzimes, skin cancers and pigmentation. Its low intensity and high variability make its measurement very delicate, in consequence UV radiation is not measured routinely in <b>ordinary</b> <b>climatological</b> <b>stations.</b> Studies from several scientists show that the UV fraction in the global solar radiation spectrum varies between O and 6 %. Based in such studies, the diurnal oscillation of UV radiation intensity throughout the year is estimated at two sites in Costa Rica. The UV radiation over a horizontal surface at 10 ° N under a cloudless sky with transmissivity 0. 6 is also calculated as a potential value.

40|$|The water {{retention}} {{capacity of a}} landscape, usually measured for a catchment basin, {{is a very important}} and decisive characteristic to identify the runoff amount from the catchment area and, in consequence, for antierosion and flood protection measures. Besides, creating water reserves in the landscape and keeping the water in them is also rather important. Soil humidity contributes to the calculation of potential {{water retention}} through modelling the runoff amount and peak discharge from the catchment basin within an area not larger than 5 – 10 km 2. This method is based on curve number values (CN), which are tabulated according to hydrological characteristics of soils, land use, vegetation cover, tillage, antierosion measures and soil humidity, estimated as a 5 -day sum of preceding precipitation values. This estimation is known as the antecedent precipitation index and it is divided into 3 degrees – I, II, III. Degree I indicates dry soil but still moist enough to till, whereas degree III means that the soil is oversaturated by water from preceding rainfall. Degree II is commonly used in this context as the antecedent precipitation index. The aim {{of this paper is to}} obtain real antecedent precipitation index values in given <b>climatological</b> <b>stations</b> (Brno, Dačice, Holešov, Náměšť nad Oslavou, Strážnice, Telč – Kostelní Myslová, Velké Meziříčí, Znojmo – Kuchařovice) for the period of years 1961 – 2009.
