5|$|Although American {{officials}} {{at the highest levels}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>intelligence</b> community (e.g. CIA Director William Colby) were certain that the South Vietnamese government would collapse, everyone in the U.S. government underestimated the speed of the North Vietnamese advance during the 1975 Spring Offensive and how quickly South Vietnam's Army would collapse.|$|E

He retired in September 1951, and was then employed as chief of security for the US Air Force's Arnold Engineering Development Center at Arnold Air Force Base, Tennessee. He died on 23 October 1971.|$|E
5|$|In December 1928 Matsui {{left his}} post as Chief <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Intelligence</b> Division {{in order to}} make an official, year-long trip to Europe.

5|$|Indonesian {{nationalist}} {{and military}} hardliners, particularly leaders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>intelligence</b> agency Kopkamtib and special operations unit, Opsus, saw the Portuguese coup {{as an opportunity}} for East Timor's integration with Indonesia. The central government and military feared that an East Timor governed by leftists {{could be used as a}} base for incursions by unfriendly powers into Indonesia, and also that an independent East Timor within the archipelago could inspire secessionist sentiments within Indonesian provinces.|$|E

5|$|U.S. {{officials}} said that the CIA conducted a review of intelligence supplied by al-Balawi, examining whether he supplied false information about U.S. successes amid valid data used to establish his credibility. The investigation included a review of a list of senior al Qaeda and Taliban operatives reported killed in U.S. drone strikes since January 2009. The National Counterterrorism Center conducted its own review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>intelligence</b> al-Balawi provided, two {{officials said}}.|$|E
5|$|A {{graduate}} of the United States Military Academy at West Point, he was commissioned in the US Army Corps of Engineers in 1919. He graduated from the United States Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas in 1940, and became Assistant Chief, and later Chief, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Intelligence</b> Division at the Office of the Chief of Engineers in Washington, DC. In May 1942, he negotiated the Loper-Hotline Agreement, under which responsibility for military mapping and survey of the globe was divided between the United States and the United Kingdom. In 1944, he was appointed Chief Engineer of US Army Forces, Pacific Ocean Areas. In this role he was involved with the planning of the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign and the Okinawa campaign. After the fighting ended, he participated in the Occupation of Japan.|$|E
5|$|According to Moyzisch, the German Foreign Office did {{not make}} much use of the documents, because {{officers}} there were divided about their reliability for several reasons. There was {{a steady stream of}} documents, which was highly unusual. Cicero seemed to have used sophisticated photography techniques to create unusually clear images, which raised the question of whether he acted alone. Antipathy between Papen and Ribbentrop added to the ineffective analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>intelligence.</b> Aware of the Allied forces attempts to bring Turkey into the war, however, Papen was able to thwart their efforts for a time by threatening to destroy Ä°zmir and Istanbul if Turkey declared war against Germany. Being able to postpone Turkey's alliance with the Allied forces and the use of their airfields, Papen told Ribbentrop that the way was now clear to take the Balkans.|$|E

5|$|After the war ended, the OSS {{conducted}} {{an investigation into}} Cicero, interviewing key German players including Moyzisch. It was postulated that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>intelligence</b> conveyed by Cicero to the Germans, the most notable information came from Knatchbull-Hugessen's notes, particularly regarding diplomatic efforts with the Turkish government. Many of the other documents were considered by Ostuf Schuddekoft, head of the British section of Amt VI , to be {{too old to be}} of much value to the Germans. Moyzisch was aggressively interviewed by the Allies and was a witness at the Nuremberg trials, after which he wrote a book to address rumors and explain his role during the war. He was never charged with a war crime.|$|E
5|$|As Chief <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Intelligence</b> Division, Matsui was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of Chiang Kai-shek, who was attempting to end the civil war in China and unify the country under his leadership. Matsui hoped that Chiang would succeed and form a strong partnership with Japan to resist both Western influence in Asia and communism. However, Matsui's tenure in office was punctuated by a series of crises. Against Matsui's advice the Japanese government sent troops to the Chinese city of Jinan in 1928 to protect Japanese property and civilians, but they ended up clashing with the Chinese Army. Matsui headed to Jinan to help settle the affair, but while he was still there Japanese army officers assassinated Zhang Zuolin, the warlord leader of Manchuria. Matsui, who had been a supporter of Zhang, immediately left for Manchuria to find out what had happened. He demanded that the officers responsible for the assassination be punished.|$|E
5|$|As {{there was}} no defined anti-shipping role in pre-war plans, obtaining {{information}} on the enemy's seaborne commercial traffic did not receive high priority, and once the war started, {{it was difficult to}} establish quickly the means of acquiring this information, especially after the fall of Norway and France in April and May 1940. The extent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>intelligence</b> vacuum at the start of Coastal Command's campaign is demonstrated by the fact that Air Ministry planners were unaware of the heavy anti-aircraft armament being fitted to enemy merchant vessels. Casualty rates, often in excess of 20 percent, clarified matters in 1940.|$|E

5|$|Instead of {{returning}} to the United States following his service in Siberia, Eichelberger became Assistant Chief of Staff, G-2 (Intelligence), of the Philippine Department on 4 May 1920. Like many officers {{in the aftermath of}} World War I, he was reduced in rank to his permanent rank of captain on 30 June 1920, but was immediately promoted to major again the next day. Em had joined him in Vladivostok in March 1920, and the two first travelled to Japan before moving on to the Philippines. In March 1921, Eichelberger became head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Intelligence</b> Mission to China. He established intelligence offices in Peking and Tientsin, and met the President of the Republic of China, Sun Yat-sen. He finally returned to the United States in May 1921, where he was assigned to the Far Eastern Section of the G-2 (Intelligence) Division of the War Department General Staff.|$|E
5|$|Lesser known {{than the}} Italian actions were the {{sabotage}} operations and limpet-mine attacks {{carried out by}} Spanish and Gibraltarian agents recruited in the Campo de Gibraltar by the Germans. The Abwehr contacted a Spanish staff officer from Campo de Gibraltar, Lieutenant Colonel Eleuterio SÃ¡nchez Rubio, a Spanish officer, member of the Falange and coordinator <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>intelligence</b> operations in the Campo, to establish a network of saboteurs with access to Gibraltar. SÃ¡nchez Rubio designated Emilio Plazas Tejera, {{also a member of}} Falange, as operations chief of the organisation. Most of the recruits for the sabotage operations were Spaniards from the Campo. A combination of financial reward, ideological commitment and some threats and intimidation were used to gather a significant number of agents. According to the British intelligence, there were at least 183 Spaniards and Gibraltarians involved in the espionage and sabotage operations against Gibraltar.|$|E
5|$|Noriega {{acted as}} a conduit for U.S. support to the Contra militants in Nicaragua for many years, {{including}} funds and weapons. He allowed the CIA to establish listening posts in Panama, and also helped the U.S.-backed Salvadoran government against the leftist Salvadoran insurgent Farabundo MartÃ­ National Liberation Front. U.S. spy ships used bases in Panama in their operations against the Nicaraguan government, and much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>intelligence</b> gathered by these ships was processed in the U.S. bases in Panama. Noriega permitted these activities despite the Panama Canal treaties restricting {{the use of the}} U.S. bases to protecting the canal.|$|E

5|$|In 1941, a {{division}} of the Meteorological Office was established at RAF Uxbridge as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Intelligence</b> Branch. On 1 July that year the station Sick Quarters were merged with the WAAF hospital to create the RAF Station Hospital. No. 11 Group was involved in providing air support for the Dieppe Raid (Operation Jubilee) on 19 August 1942. Air Marshal Trafford Leigh-Mallory commanded participating Allied air forces from the 11Group Operation Room. The air operations section of Operation Overlord, the 6 June 1944 Normandy landings (D-Day), was also controlled from RAF Uxbridge. Orders from the station were the only ones issued to Allied air units on the day. The headquarters of the 2nd Tactical Air Force and 9th Tactical Air Force of the USAAF were stationed at Uxbridge while preparations were made for the invasion. On D-Day, the 11Group Controller was responsible for ensuring sufficient air patrols of the United Kingdom, the main shipping routes, and the beach landing areas.|$|E

In May 1942, he negotiated the Loper-Hotline Agreement, under which responsibility for military mapping and survey of the globe was divided between the United States and the United Kingdom. The agreement also specified technical features such as grids, scales and formats, so Allied servicemen everywhere would have common maps. For his services in this post, he was awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal on 28 May 1944.|$|E
