5|$|The {{speculation}} of {{the existence}} of life <b>on</b> <b>Venus</b> decreased significantly since the early 1960s, when spacecraft began studying Venus and {{it became clear that the}} conditions <b>on</b> <b>Venus</b> are extreme compared to those on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1980s, it {{was thought}} that the cause of the glow was {{lightning}} <b>on</b> <b>Venus.</b> The Soviet Venera 9 and 10 orbiters obtained optical and electromagnetic evidence of lightning <b>on</b> <b>Venus.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The densely lineated plains unit (pdl) {{is defined}} by the dense and {{parallel}} lineaments packed on the unit. [...] They make up a small area <b>on</b> <b>Venus's</b> global surface of around 7.2 x 108 km2. The lineament is the pattern of deformation, which make it a typical structural-material unit.|$|R

5|$|Several {{lines of}} {{evidence}} point to ongoing volcanic activity <b>on</b> <b>Venus.</b> During the Soviet Venera program, the Venera 9 orbiter obtained spectroscopic evidence of lightning <b>on</b> <b>Venus,</b> and the Venera 12 descent probe obtained additional evidence of lightning and thunder. The European Space Agency's Venus Express in 2007 detected whistler waves further confirming {{the occurrence of}} lightning <b>on</b> <b>Venus.</b> One possibility is that ash from a volcanic eruption was generating the lightning. Another piece of evidence comes from measurements of sulfur dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, which dropped {{by a factor of}} 10 between 1978 and 1986, jumped in 2006, and again declined 10-fold. This may mean that levels had been boosted several times by large volcanic eruptions.|$|E
5|$|All winds <b>on</b> <b>Venus</b> are {{ultimately}} driven by convection. Hot air {{rises in the}} equatorial zone, where solar heating is concentrated, and flows to the poles. Such an almost-planetwide overturning of the troposphere is called Hadley circulation. However, the meridional air motions are much slower than zonal winds. The poleward limit of the planet wide Hadley cell <b>on</b> <b>Venus</b> is near ±60° latitudes. Here air starts to descend {{and returns to the}} equator below the clouds. This interpretation is supported by the distribution of the carbon monoxide, which is also concentrated in the vicinity of ±60° latitudes. Poleward of the Hadley cell a different pattern of circulation is observed. In the latitude range 60°–70° cold polar collars exist. They are characterised by temperatures about 30–40K lower than in the upper troposphere at nearby latitudes. The lower temperature is probably caused by the upwelling of the air in them and by the resulting adiabatic cooling. Such an interpretation is supported by the denser and higher clouds in the collars. The clouds lie at 70–72km altitude in the collars—about 5km higher than at the poles and low latitudes. A connection may exist between the cold collars and high speed midlatitude jets in which winds blow as fast as 140m/s. Such jets are a natural consequence of the Hadley–type circulation and should exist <b>on</b> <b>Venus</b> between 55–60° latitude.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, Gerty Cori {{died after}} a ten-year {{struggle}} with myelosclerosis. She remained {{active in the}} research laboratory until the end. She received recognition for her achievements through multiple awards and honors. The Cori crater on the Moon and the Cori crater <b>on</b> <b>Venus</b> are named after her.|$|E

5|$|The first vortex <b>on</b> <b>Venus</b> was {{discovered}} {{at the north}} pole by the Pioneer Venus mission in 1978. A discovery of the second large 'double-eyed' vortex {{at the south pole}} of Venus was made in the summer of 2006 by Venus Express, which came with no surprise.|$|E
5|$|Almost a {{thousand}} impact craters <b>on</b> <b>Venus</b> are evenly distributed across its surface. On other cratered bodies, such as Earth and the Moon, craters show {{a range of}} states of degradation. On the Moon, degradation is caused by subsequent impacts, whereas on Earth it is caused by wind and rain erosion. <b>On</b> <b>Venus,</b> about 85% of the craters are in pristine condition. The number of craters, together with their well-preserved condition, indicates the planet underwent a global resurfacing event about 300–600 million years ago, followed by a decay in volcanism. Whereas Earth's crust is in continuous motion, Venus {{is thought to be}} unable to sustain such a process. Without plate tectonics to dissipate heat from its mantle, Venus instead undergoes a cyclical process in which mantle temperatures rise until they reach a critical level that weakens the crust. Then, over a period of about 100 million years, subduction occurs on an enormous scale, completely recycling the crust.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of the {{intrinsic}} magnetic field <b>on</b> <b>Venus,</b> the solar wind penetrates relatively deep into the planetary exosphere and causes substantial atmosphere loss. The loss happens mainly via the magnetotail. Currently the main ion types being lost are O+, H+ and He+. The ratio of hydrogen to oxygen losses is around 2 (i.e. almost stoichiometric) indicating the ongoing loss of water.|$|E
5|$|Solaris is not {{the only}} work of Lem's to be filmed. Over ten film and {{television}} adaptations of his work exist, such as adaptations of The Astronauts (First Spaceship <b>on</b> <b>Venus,</b> 1960) and The Magellan Nebula (Ikarie XB-1, 1963). Lem himself was, however, critical of most of the screen adaptations, with the sole exception of Przekładaniec in 1968 by Andrzej Wajda. More recently, in 2013, the Israeli–Polish co-production The Congress was released, inspired by Lem's novel The Futurological Congress.|$|E
5|$|The longitudes of {{physical}} features <b>on</b> <b>Venus</b> are expressed relative to its prime meridian.

5|$|The {{troposphere}} <b>on</b> <b>Venus</b> contains 99% of {{the atmosphere}} by mass. Ninety percent {{of the atmosphere}} of Venus is within 28km of the surface; by comparison, 90% of the atmosphere of Earth is within 10km of the surface. At a height of 50km the atmospheric pressure is approximately equal to that at the surface of Earth. On the night side of Venus clouds can still be found at 80km above the surface.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the harsh}} {{conditions}} on the surface, the atmospheric pressure and temperature at about 50km to 65km above {{the surface of the}} planet is nearly {{the same as that of}} the Earth, making its upper atmosphere the most Earth-like area in the Solar System, even more so than the surface of Mars. Due to the similarity in pressure and temperature and the fact that breathable air (21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen) is a lifting gas <b>on</b> <b>Venus</b> in the same way that helium is a lifting gas on Earth, the upper atmosphere has been proposed as a location for both exploration and colonization.|$|E
5|$|The {{mesosphere}} of Venus can {{be divided}} into two layers: the lower one between 62–73km and the upper one between 73–95km. In the first layer the temperature is nearly constant at 230K (−43°C). This layer coincides with the upper cloud deck. In the second layer temperature starts to decrease again reaching about 165K (−108°C) at the altitude of 95km, where mesopause begins. It is the coldest part of the Venusian dayside atmosphere. In the dayside mesopause, which serves as a boundary between the mesophere and thermosphere and is located between 95–120km, temperature increases to a constant—about 300–400K (27–127°C)—value prevalent in the thermosphere. In contrast, the nightside Venusian thermosphere is the coldest place <b>on</b> <b>Venus</b> with temperature as low as 100K (−173°C). It is even called a cryosphere.|$|E

50|$|The {{missions}} primary {{task was}} to deploy the Galileo spacecraft with its attached IUS booster. Deployment occurred on schedule at 19:15 EDT on 18 October, slightly more than six hours after launch, and the IUS successfully boosted Galileo toward <b>Venus</b> <b>on</b> {{the first leg of}} its six-year journey to Jupiter. The spacecraft was injected <b>on</b> a <b>Venus</b> transfer orbit at 20:20 EDT, and separated from the IUS 47 minutes later.|$|R
5|$|Venus (0.7 AU {{from the}} Sun) is close {{in size to}} Earth (0.815 Earth masses) and, like Earth, has a thick {{silicate}} mantle around an iron core, a substantial atmosphere, and evidence of internal geological activity. It is much drier than Earth, and its atmosphere is ninety times as dense. Venus has no natural satellites. It is the hottest planet, with surface temperatures over 400 °C (752°F), most likely due {{to the amount of}} greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. No definitive evidence of current geological activity has been detected <b>on</b> <b>Venus,</b> but it has no magnetic field that would prevent depletion of its substantial atmosphere, which suggests that its atmosphere is being replenished by volcanic eruptions.|$|E
5|$|NASA {{maintains}} {{a catalog of}} Venus transits covering the period 2000 BCE to 4000 CE. Currently, transits occur only in June or December (see table) and the occurrence of these events slowly drifts, becoming {{later in the year}} by about two days every 243-year cycle. Transits usually occur in pairs, on nearly the same date eight years apart. This is because the length of eight Earth years is almost the same as 13 years <b>on</b> <b>Venus,</b> so every eight years the planets are in roughly the same relative positions. This approximate conjunction usually results in a pair of transits, but it is not precise enough to produce a triplet, since Venus arrives 22 hours earlier each time. The last transit not {{to be part of a}} pair was in 1396. The next will be in 3089; in 2854 (the second of the 2846/2854 pair), although Venus will just miss the Sun as seen from the Earth's equator, a partial transit will be visible from some parts of the southern hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|Nereide {{surrendered}} on {{the morning}} of 24 August and over the next three days Magicienne and Sirius were abandoned and burnt to prevent their seizure by the French. On the morning of 28 August, Iphigenia, laden with survivors from the grounded frigates, was confronted by Hamelin and his main squadron, which had taken seven days to travel from Port Napoleon. Hugely outnumbered, Lambert {{had no choice but to}} surrender, ending the worst British naval defeat of the entire war. Rowley arrived in Boadicea on 29 August but was unable to influence the outcome of the battle and was chased back to Saint Denis by Hamelin <b>on</b> <b>Vénus.</b> On the defensive, Rowley sent messages to Rodriguez, Madras and the Cape of Good Hope requesting urgent reinforcements as Bouvet began a blockade of Île Bourbon in the hope of trapping Boadicea.|$|E
