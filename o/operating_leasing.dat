40|$|Abstract RESEARH OBJECTIVES The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the value relevance of constructively capitalized <b>operating</b> <b>leases.</b> Currently, leases are classified either <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> or capital leases. Unlike capital <b>leases,</b> <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> are reported as rental expense and omitted from balance sheet. Information of <b>operating</b> <b>lease</b> commitments is disclosed in footnotes. <b>Operating</b> <b>leases</b> represent one of the largest source of off-balance sheet financing. There has been a concern among standard setters for a long time, whether the current accounting practice offers reliable representation of leasing transactions that companies are engaged into for financial statement users. This study aims to examine, if the <b>operating</b> <b>lease</b> commitments are reflected in the share prices, i. e. if the market perceives the <b>operating</b> <b>lease</b> information correctly, even though reported off-balance sheet. DATA AND METHODOLOGY The data used in this study is obtained from Compustat. The data is from years 1993 - 2013 and comprises observations of listed companies on air transportation industry, totaling to 850 observations. The study is conducted using OLS regression analysis, by estimating three different models. FINDINGS The study fails to find incremental information content for constructively capitalized <b>operating</b> <b>leases,</b> beyond that contained in reported assets, liabilities and sales. Thus, study fails to find evidence for value relevance of <b>operating</b> <b>leases...</b>|$|R

40|$|This study investigates whether {{including}} <b>operating</b> <b>lease</b> commitments {{in financial}} distress prediction models {{would increase the}} classification accuracy of these models. Classification accuracy measures the percentages of correctly classified companies in {{either of the two}} categories (healthy or financially distressed). This study includes 38 listed companies in financial distress (of which 21 companies eventually went bankrupt) and 62 healthy companies in the period from 2000 to 2004. It is concluded that financially distressed companies use relatively more <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> than healthy companies. However, the accuracy of the financial distress prediction models did not significantly improve by taking <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> into account.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This study {{analyses}} {{the impact}} that <b>operating</b> <b>lease</b> capitalisation has on key financial statement ratios and failure prediction indicators of listed South African companies operating within five sectors (namely General Industrials, Industrial Transportation, Food & Drug Retailers, General Retailers and Travel & Leisure), as well as whether the impact thereof is substantially {{the same as the}} new proposed accounting treatment for Type A and Type B leases in terms of ED/ 2013 / 6 (IASB, 2013). Furthermore, the extent of lease usage in South Africa and whether the size of a company has a bearing on its extent of leasing is examined. Additional analysis is also performed investigating the materiality of straight-lining and onerous contract provisions relating to <b>operating</b> <b>leases,</b> as well as the impact of <b>operating</b> <b>lease</b> capitalisation on disclosed loan covenants. Based predominantly on the constructive <b>operating</b> <b>lease</b> capitalisation method developed by Imhoff, Lipe and Wright (1991 & 1997), a refined constructive lease capitalisation model is developed in this study which incorporates aspects of current lease accounting rules not previously considered, namely provisions recognised in respect of the straight-lining of <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> as well as onerous <b>operating</b> <b>lease</b> contracts. This model also incorporates the new proposed lease accounting rules which require the capitalisation of all leases (Type A and Type B). The results indicate that the capitalisation of future non-cancellable <b>operating</b> <b>lease</b> commitments {{have a significant impact on}} key financial statement ratios and failure prediction indicators, most notably leverage and other debt-related ratios. Furthermore, of the five sectors analysed, retailers were the most affected. When considering the new proposed accounting treatment for Type A and Type B leases, the results indicate that <b>operating</b> <b>lease</b> capitalisation has substantially the same impact on key financial statement ratios and Altman‟s failure prediction models as the conventional <b>operating</b> <b>lease</b> capitalisation method, except for certain debt-related and profitability ratios. Further results indicate that <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> are used extensively and substantially more than finance leases within South Africa. It was also found that <b>operating</b> <b>lease</b> usage was positively related to company size, while finance lease usage decreased as company size increased. Curvilinear relationships were also noted between a company‟s size and its extent of leasing. Further analysis revealed that recognised straight-lining lease provisions are substantially more material than recognised onerous lease contract provisions and are capable of distorting the analysis of <b>operating</b> <b>lease</b> capitalisation if ignored. When scrutinising loan covenants disclosed, it was established that none of the loan covenants were breached when capitalising operating leases; however, in each instance <b>operating</b> <b>lease</b> capitalisation negatively impacted all covenant related ratios...|$|R

40|$|In 2008, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), in {{cooperation}} with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), will issue a new proposal to change the current accounting regulation with respect to leasing to an alternative approach. This new lease-accounting approach, called the “asset and liability approach”, capitalises all leases on the balance sheet. This contrasts with the current lease-accounting approach, called the “risk and reward approach”, which discriminates between the recognition of financial leases on the balance sheet and the disclosure of <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> off the balance sheet. As with the current risk and reward approach, also the asset and liability approach has many opponents. This study investigates: - what the impact on financial ratios might be when <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> are capitalised on the balance sheet, - what company characteristics determines the choice for <b>operating</b> <b>leases,</b> and - whether financially-distressed companies use more <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> than healthy companies. The results show that <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> have become a major financing source, which is not only attributable to the accounting treatment of <b>operating</b> <b>leases.</b> However, the information on <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> as required in the footnotes to the financial statements is not transparent, nor reliable.

Then, financial debt burden ratios were computed to determine the impact from the capitalization of lease information. The usage of <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> increased, significantly from the first study to the 1991 study, and this trend continues.

40|$|<b>Operating</b> <b>leases</b> {{have grown}} {{significantly}} {{as a source}} of corporate financing over the last 30 years. Their off-balance sheet treatment, which may in part explain their popularity, raises concern that financial risk may be misjudged and capital misallocated. Prior research evidence on the above issue is mixed. To improve reporting transparency, regulators propose a new accounting concept, right of use, which will add the present value of most leases to the balance sheet. We examine the effect of <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> on loan pricing by banks, a sophisticated financial statement user. Since leases are a potential debt substitute, we expect them to be important in our setting. With loan spreads as the dependent variable, we test the differential explanatory power and model fit of as-reported financial ratios versus financial ratios adjusted for the capitalization of <b>operating</b> <b>leases.</b> We find that lease-adjusted financial ratios better explain loan spreads, especially for larger lenders. Our results also suggest that retailer leases that are closer in substance to rental agreements than financed asset purchases are less relevant for credit risk assessments. Thus we conclude that banks not only price <b>operating</b> <b>leases,</b> on average, but also make distinctions about which leases should be priced. Second, we explore the role of credit rating agencies and confirm that credit ratings also reflect capitalized <b>operating</b> <b>leases,</b> and find support for an informational role for others’ credit assessments. However, unlike banks, rating agencies appear to capitalize all <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> mechanically. Overall, our results suggest that banks and rating agencies adjust for the off-balance sheet presentation of <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> and, at least in the case of banks, attempt to do so to reflect the underlying economics of the leases. This evidence lessens concern over the potential negative consequences of existing <b>operating</b> <b>lease</b> accounting and raises concern over proposed accounting that capitalizes all leases regardless of their economic characteristics...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{simulate}} how capitalisation of operating lease will affect leverage and profitability ratios in listed Swedish companies; and observe if the use of operating lease has changed since {{the release of the}} first exposure draft in 2010. Research design – The study is an ex ante research, simulating a predicted outcome of the new planned lease standard. A deductive and quantitative approach have been used for this comparative study. Secondary data have been collected from 55 Swedish companies listed on NASDAQ Stockholm OMX Large cap and processed with the constructive capitalisation model introduced by Imhoff et al. (1991) to simulate the capitalisation effect on financial ratios. Findings - The result indicates that all financial ratios tested (debt/equity, equity/assets, profit margin, return on assets and return on equity) will have a statistically significant change on all tested years, 2010 – 2013, with a new lease standard. It also show a high correlation between companies’ ratios before and after capitalisation. No trends in the use of <b>operating</b> <b>leasing</b> can be observed from this study.   Contribution – The conclusion {{of this study suggest that}} although there is an significant impact on all the companies financial ratios, there would be no big comparability problems, if implementing the new standard. This study supports the change in leasing standard since it would show a truer and fairer picture of companies’ use of leasing and increase the comparability among companies for potential investors.

40|$|One of {{the main}} reasons that leasing is a {{financial}} alternative so popular in the world is the one that synthesize its own „philosophy”: It’s not ownership of the assets but their effective use is the one leading to profit.

This article aims to approach the leasing as a source or as a financing alternative investments, to highlight the benefits given by that to the three parties involved in a lease - the lessee or the user of the lease, the lessee or the leasing company and the good or the assets supplier which are the subject lease.
