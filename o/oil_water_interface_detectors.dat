We performed laboratory experiments to investigate the influence of <b>oil</b> wettability and <b>water</b> saturation upon the complex resistivity of oil-bearing sands in the frequency range 1 mHz- 1 kHz. For a sand saturated by a nonwetting oil, both the resistivity and the magnitude of the phase increase with the oil saturation, as expected from theoretical considerations.

The quadrature conductivity decreases with the oil with the same trend in {{presence of}} wetting and nonwetting <b>oils</b> for relative <b>water</b> saturation above 0. 5. In the case of a nonwetting oil, the results are quantitatively predicted by available theories.

The spray-dried PPI had higher emulsifying activity index (EAI), whereas the freeze-dried PPI had higher emulsion stability index (ESI). The freeze-dried PPI had significantly higher surface hydrophobicity, disulfide bonds and β-sheets than the spray-dried one (p < 0. 05). While the latter contained more hydrogen bonds than the former (p < 0. 05), as shown by the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, which suggested that the spray-dried PPI had relatively higher unfolded or flexible structure than the freeze-dried PPI. Folded and wrinkled morphology of spray-dried PPI but plate-shaped structure in the freeze-dried PPI suggested that droplet shrinkage and solute concentration led to the distinct morphology, respectively. These two different drying processes greatly brought about different structure and properties thereof.

40|$|International audienceThe {{impact of}} {{including}} hydrophobically modified silica on the morphology of miniemulsified monomer mixtures {{and that of}} the resulting polymer particles was investigated, with emphasis placed on the distribution and localization of the inorganic phase. Silica nanoparticles with diameters of 20 and 78 nm were first modified with gamma-methacryloxypropyl trimethoxysilane (gamma-MPS) to favor their dispersion in methyl methacrylate (MMA) /n-butyl acrylate (BuA) and mixtures of varying MMA to BuA weight ratios. The monomer silica dispersions were then emulsified by ultrasonication, and the resulting silica-loaded droplets were examined using cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). This represents the first time such silica-loaded nanodroplets were examined in this way. The results of the cryo-TEM show that whereas the silica particles could easily be dispersed in MMA or a mixture of MMA and BuA to produce stable dispersions, the emulsification step promotes the (re) localization of the silica at the <b>oil</b> <b>water</b> <b>interfaces.</b> It was also shown that not all droplets are equal; some droplets and particles contain no silica whereas others contain many silica particles.

This effect {{is due to}} their ability to reduce the rate of lipolysis through the inhibition of the lipase-colipase complex. They have a strong affinity to oil which both prevents the lipolytic enzymes from in close contact with its substrate {{and at the same time}} protects the thylakoids form proteolytic enzymes present in gastric juices form digesting the thylakoids as quickly. This affinity also imparts thylakoids interesting emulsification properties. The objective of this study was to characterize thylakoids’ ability to stabilize oil-in-water emulsions, and to study their interfacial properties in light of their capacity to inhibit pancreatic lipase-co lipase activity in vitro. As lipolysis is an inherently interfacial process it is important to quantify their interfacial properties and to maximize the oil-water interfacial area covered by the thylakoids in future food formulations. Thylakoids isolated from spinach were used for emulsification studies using a lab-scale high shear homogenizer. The oil-in-water emulsions produced had varying amounts of thylakoids and resulting emulsions were characterized by creaming phase volume, microscopy and light scattering to determine microstructure and droplet size distributions as well as surface load. Electron micrographs showed thylakoids adsorbed as loosely bunched vesicles on the drop surfaces approximately 1 micron in size, and were found to effectively stabilize the <b>oil</b> <b>water</b> <b>interface,</b> but with large droplet size (20 to 200 micron range) and relatively high surface loads (2 to 10 mg/m 2) ...|$|R

The ice nucleation process based on the standard and classical theory of homogeneous freezing initiates within the interior volume of a cloud droplet.

For example, at − 33 °C, the reported volume-based freezing rates of ice in supercooled water vary {{by as many as}} 5 orders of magnitude, which is well outside the range of measurement uncertainties. Here, we show that the process of ice nucleus formation at the air (or <b>oil)</b> -liquid <b>water</b> <b>interface</b> may help to explain why experimental results on ice nucleation rates yield different results in different ambient phases.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{work on the}} DNA directed {{assembly of}} colloids at liquid and solid interfaces under specifically sculpted attractive interactions via depletion forces and/or magnetic fields. The highly specific and thermally reversible nature of binding between two complementary single strands of DNA allows us to encode binding rules among various (solid or liquid) components of the system. The thesis begins by presenting a new approach for introducing mobile DNA linkers on oil droplets, enabling a reversible adsorption of colloids at the oil/water interface. In comparison to previous cumbersome approaches involving expensive biotinylated lipids, this simple method provides a relatively higher grafting density of DNA anchors at the interface. Further, {{it is possible to}} kinetically control the surface coverage of oil droplets with colloidal particles while preserving fully ergodic colloidal dynamics on the droplets. The equilibrium nature of the absorbed colloids is illustrated by exploring the quasi-two-dimensional (2 d) phase behaviour under the influence of depletion interactions. Colloids bound to the <b>oil</b> <b>water</b> <b>interface</b> are found to be significantly less diffusive compared to their bulk counterparts. Simulation studies from collaboration reaffirm the experimentally observed phase behaviour and the nature of compositional arrest. Further, some preliminary results on the phase behaviour of binary colloidal mixtures at the oil/water interface are also presented. The last section of this thesis demonstrates an approach for creating novel superstructures of DNA coated colloids (DNAcc) directed via an externally applied magnetic field. Raspberry-like and long coaxial skeletons of smaller colloids around larger superparamagnetic colloidal cores in a two component system are shown. The rigidity of these mesoscopic superstructures is enhanced by adding a suitably functionalized third component.

Much attention has recently been payed to surfaces with extrinsic curvature stiffness ~ to be denoted shortly as SS's (for "stiff surfaces"). They seem to represent the sheets of color electric flux tubes be-tween quarks {{in a much better}} way than surfaces equipped with tension only [2]. Their fluctuations have the desirable feature of being asymptotically free in the ultraviolet [1, 2] so that they are able to gen-erate a tension spontaneously just as in QCD. SS's are known to be predominant also in many other sys-tems appearing, e. g., as domain walls in magnets, as <b>oil</b> <b>water</b> <b>interfaces</b> in microemulsions or as biologi-cal membranes. While the fluctuation properties of a single nearly flat SS have by now been studied up to the two-loop level in any dimension D [3] and ex-actly in the limit D-~oc [4], the behaviour of grand canonical ensembles of SS's is still understood quite poorly. The reason is the complexity of the func-tional integrals over arbitrary topologies and the many possibilities of local interactions between different surface elements. So, any limited information on multisurface systems i of potential use. Some time ago, a simple model has been devised by two of us (J. K.)

The understanding of the phenomena associated with the phase transitions like: oil solubilization in aqueous solution of surfactant or <b>water</b> solubilization in <b>oil</b> solution of surfactant, as well as the type, inversion and stability of microemulsions, depend on the spectral behaviour of dye in microemulsion. The present paper aims at testing the anionic dye of sulphonephtalein type (bromthymol blue, BTB) as molecular probe (marker) in micelle systems which contain nonionic surfactant (Brij 30 and Triton X 114), in order to get information about solvatochromic effects associated with the preferential location of BTB in microemulsions. Electronic spectra of molecular probe (BTB) for each system present distinct absorption maximum in UV – VIS range. The experimental results of interaction between surfactant and BTB dye in aqueous solutions allowed the calculation of their equilibrium constant. It was concluded that the bromthymol blue dye is an effective molecular probe with significant solvatochromic effects, without surface-active properties and good affinity versus nonionic surfactants, all these features being useful for the construction of phase diagrams in colloidal systems...|$|R

The results from the pendant drop measurements and the interfacial rheology studies were in agreement with each other and demonstrated that the Sn- 2 monoglyceride, {{which is one of the}} lipolysis products generated when a Sn- 1, 3 regiospecific lipase catalyzes triglyceride hydrolysis, is very interfacially active and efficiently expels the enzyme from the interface. Ellipsometry conducted at the liquid-liquid interface showed that the lipase forms a sublayer in the aqueous phase, just beneath the monoglyceride-covered interface. Sn- 1 / 3 monoglycerides do not behave this way because they are rapidly degraded to fatty acid and glycerol and the fatty acid (or the fatty acid salt) does not have enough interfacial activity to expel the lipase from the interface. Since the lipases present in the gastrointestinal tract are highly Sn- 1, 3 regiospecific, we believe that the results obtained can be transferred to the in vivo situation.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{supercooled}} liquid water crystallization into ice is still not well understood. Current experimental data on homogeneous freezing rates of ice nucleation in supercooled water droplets show considerable scatter. For example, at - 33 C, the reported freezing nucleation rates vary {{by as much as}} 5 orders of magnitude, which is well outside the range of measurement uncertainties. Until now, experimental data on the freezing of supercooled water has been analyzed under the assumption that nucleation of ice took place in the interior volume of a water droplet. Here, the same data is reanalyzed assuming that the nucleation occurred "pseudoheterogeneously" at the air (or <b>oil)</b> -liquid <b>water</b> <b>interface</b> of the droplet. Our analysis suggest that the scatter in the nucleation data can be explained by two main factors. First, the current assumption that nucleation occurs solely inside the volume of a water droplet is incorrect. Second, because the nucleation process most likely occurs on the surface, the rates of nuclei formation could differ vastly when oil or air interfaces are involved. Our results suggest that ice freezing in clouds may initiate on droplet surfaces and such a process can allow for low amounts of liquid water (approx. 0. 002 g per cubic meters) to remain supercooled down to - 40 C as observed in the atmosphere...|$|R

Detachment of the colloids from the interface by addition of an oil soluble salt [2] recently supported this hypothesis. This current study focuses on further analysis of the phase behaviour of these particles near an oil-water interface. In a previous study [2] it was shown that the collective motion of the particles, called drift, was an issue. In this study {{we will try to}} reduce the drift by adjusting the experimental 2 D setup. A setup which fixed the position of the oil droplet with a well was developed and used for measuring a two dimensional interfacial structure of these non-touching colloids. This resulted in the following recommendation: Drift can be minimized by using a well setup with a diameter of 7 mm and a depth of 1 mm with a 2. 0 μL oil droplet fixed in the middle and the interfacial structure can be improved by using a volume-pipette for adding the oil-droplet and a water phase which is completely dyed.

While {{the properties of}} surfactants and particles under a range of conditions and concentrations are relatively well known, there are some areas that require further investigation. The wettability of colloidal particles {{is one of the}} main factors that determine how they behave in a given system but determining the wettability is difficult due to the small size of the particles. The Film Calliper Method (FCM) has been proposed as a simple technique for the direct measurement of the contact angles of micrometer and submicrometer particles in their natural environment. One of the main aims of this work was to develop the Film Calliper Method for measuring contact angles at oil -water interfaces. The FCM was therefore used to measure the contact angles at <b>oil</b> - <b>water</b> <b>interfaces</b> for a range of particles, such as latex and silica particles, in different systems. For the first time directly measured contact angles are linked to the types of emulsions stabilised by the particles. The FCM was also used to directly measure the contact angles of silica particles in cationic surfactant solutions at air and oil interfaces for the first time. The stability of foams and emulsions made with particle - surfactant mixtures were investigated and related to the particle contact angles. Janus particles are a special category of particles which have different properties on each hemisphere. A method for making Janus particles was developed using template silica particles masked with a polymerised Pickering emulsion. The portion of surface exposed for treating can be tuned by controlling the inherent wettability of the template particles as proven with fluorescence microscopy.

This binding, demonstrated by retention of radioactivity on a millipore filter, could be reduced by about 50 % using high concentrations of competitive sugars. The non-ionic detergent, Triton X- 100, solubilized both the membrane proteins and lipids. Precipitation of the solubilized material with 50 % saturated ammonium sulphate in the presence of radioactive glucose indicated that a component could bind D-glucose in preference to L-glucose. This component was probably protein or lipoprotein as precipitation with 10 $ trichloroacetic acid reduced the binding of D-glucose. Assuming all the D-glucose binding, (1. 14 x 10 g per mg of protein), was involved in carrier function, each red cell would contain 95, 000 active sites. Although bovine serum globulins, (and red cell membrane proteins solubilized by butanol extraction), also showed some preferential binding of D-glucose on precipitation by ammonium sulphate, the binding activity was much lower than the Triton X- 100 extract. D-glucose binding to the Triton X- 100 material could be reduced using the non-competitive inhibitor mercuric chloride and high concentrations of competitive sugars. These studies indicate that protein or lipoprotein might be involved inhexose carrier function, but although the extracts showed specificity towards optical isomers, they failed to mimic a number of other features of the hexose transport system, for example, saturation and the effects of phloretin. <p...|$|R
