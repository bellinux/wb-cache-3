Zenitlot is a precision <b>plumbing</b> <b>instrument,</b> which must provide vertical axis for proper functioning.

40|$|This work {{presents}} the inherent advantages of using hydrogen rather than helium as the carrier gas in volatiles analysis. <b>Plumbing</b> and <b>instrument</b> considerations for using hydrogen safely are discussed. Examples of time savings for overall better productivity are shown.

40|$|The NASA Glenn Research Center has {{developed}} a Total Water Content (TWC) Isokinetic Sampling Probe. Since it is not sensitive to cloud water particle phase nor size, it is particularly attractive to support super-cooled large droplet and high ice water content aircraft icing studies. The instrument is comprised of the Sampling Probe, Sample Flow Control, and Water Vapor Measurement subsystems. Analysis and testing have been conducted on the subsystems to ensure their proper function and accuracy. End-to-end bench testing has also been conducted to ensure {{the reliability of the}} entire instrument system. A Stokes Number based collection efficiency correction was developed to correct for probe thickness effects. The authors further discuss the need to ensure that no condensation occurs within the <b>instrument</b> <b>plumbing.</b> <b>Instrument</b> measurements compared to facility calibrations from testing in the NASA Glenn Icing Research Tunnel are presented and discussed. There appears to be liquid water content and droplet size effects in {{the differences between the two}} measurement techniques...|$|R

40|$|In deep {{vertical}} shafts, it is {{not possible}} to use common engineering measurement techniques like e. g. traversing. Therefore the transfer of geodetic networks consists of the separate transfer of both the position and the bearing. Whereas the transfer of the position can be managed by mechanical or <b>optical</b> <b>plumbs,</b> the orientation of the underground network often is determinded by high-precision surveying gyroscopes for north-seeking. This method however, is influenced by deflections from the vertical which are not exactly known. This paper describes a novel method to transfer the bearing by combination of autocollimation with a high-precision inertial navigation system (INS). The principles of autocollimation and INS are introduced. The motion-sequence consists of a reverse movement- comparable to a meaurement in two faces- which provides a symmetric measurement and therefore minimizes the influence of systematic and time-proportional errors of INS. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG In tiefen Schächten ist es nicht möglich, klassische Vermessungsmethoden wie z. B. Polygonierung einzusetzen. Daher wird die Netzmessung durch eine getrennte Positions- und Richtungsübertragung durchgeführt. Die Position kann einfach mit mechanischen oder optische...|$|R
5000|$|Many modern tripods are {{constructed}} of aluminum, though wood is still used for legs. The feet are either aluminum tipped with a steel point or steel. The mounting screw is often brass or brass and plastic. The mounting screw is hollow {{to allow the}} <b>optical</b> <b>plumb</b> to be viewed through the screw. The top is typically threaded with a 5/8" [...] x 11 tpi screw thread. The mounting screw is held to {{the underside of the}} tripod head by a movable arm. This permits the screw to be moved anywhere within the head's opening. The legs are attached to the head with adjustable screws that are usually kept tight enough to allow the legs to be moved with a bit of resistance. The legs are two part, with the lower part capable of telescoping to adjust the length of the leg to suit the terrain. Aluminum or steel slip joints with a tightening screw are {{at the bottom of the}} upper leg to hold the bottom part in place and fix the length. A shoulder strap is often affixed to the tripod to allow for ease of carrying the equipment over areas to be surveyed.|$|R
50|$|In {{the same}} way that <b>plumbing</b> and woodwind <b>instruments</b> are tested, the vacuum systems of {{automobiles}} may be tested in order to locate difficult-to-find vacuum leaks. Artificial smoke is deliberately introduced into the system under slight pressure and any leaks are indicated by the escaping smoke. Smoke {{can also be used to}} locate difficult-to-find leaks in the fuel evaporative emissions control (EVAP) system.|$|R
50|$|Some tubas have a {{compensating}} {{system to}} allow accurate tuning when using several valves in combination, simplifying fingering and removing {{the need to}} constantly adjust slide positions. The most popular of the automatic compensation systems was invented by Blaikley (Bevan, 1874) and was patented by Boosey (later, Boosey and Hawkes, which also, later still, produced Besson instruments). The patent on the system limited its application outside of Britain, {{and to this day}} tubas with compensating valves are primarily popular in the United Kingdom and countries of the former British Empire. The Blaikley design <b>plumbs</b> the <b>instrument</b> so that if the fourth valve is used, the air is sent back through a second set of branches in the first three valves to compensate for the combination of valves. This does have the disadvantage of making the instrument significantly more 'stuffy' or resistant to air flow when compared to a non-compensating tuba. This is due to the need for the air to flow through the valves twice. It also makes the instrument heavier. But many prefer this approach to additional valves or to manipulation of tuning slides while playing to achieve improved intonation within an ensemble. Most modern professional-grade euphoniums also now feature Blaikley-style compensating valves.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new instrument, Hoxotope, for the in situ {{measurement}} of H 2 O and its heavy deuterium isotopologue (HDO) in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere aboard the NASA WB- 57. Sensitive measurements of deltaD are accomplished through the vacuum UV photolysis of water followed by laser-induced fluorescence detection of the resultant OH and OD photofragments. The photolysis laser-induced fluorescence technique can obtain S/N> 20 for 1 ppbv HDO and S/N> 30 for 5 ppmv H 2 O for 10 s data, providing the sensitivity required for deltaD measurements in the tropopause region. The technique responds rapidly to changing water concentrations due to its inherently small sampling volume, augmented by steps taken to minimize water uptake on <b>instrument</b> <b>plumbing.</b> Data from the summer 2005 Aura Validation Experiment Water Isotope Intercomparison Flights (AVE-WIIF) out of Houston, TX show agreement for H 2 O between Hoxotope and the Harvard water vapor instrument and for HDO between Hoxotope and the Harvard ICOS water isotope instrument, to within stated instrument uncertainties. The successful intercomparison validates Hoxotope as a credible source of deltaD data in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere...|$|R
40|$|The {{scanning}} differential mobility analyzer (DMA) {{has been}} widely employed for measurement of rapidly evolving aerosol size distributions. Interpretation of data from scanning DMAs is greatly facilitated when an exponential voltage ramp is prescribed, since {{the shape of the}} instrumental transfer function remains constant throughout a scan. However, that transfer function may differ significantly from that expected for fixed voltage operation. Because no simple analytical description of the scanning DMA transfer function exists, it has been evaluated numerically by simulating particle trajectories within a TSI 3081 cylindrical DMA. These computations yield transfer functions for the DMA up scan that are roughly triangular but with widths significantly greater than those for fixed voltage operation, and transfer functions for the down scan that are highly asymmetric. The impact of these distortions is most obvious when the size distribution of the measured aerosol is narrow, but errors in recovered size and concentration can be significant even when the aerosol size distribution is much broader than the transfer function. The magnitude of these errors is dependent upon the ratio of the mean gas residence time to the exponential voltage time constant, the sheath-to-aerosol-flow ratio, and the technique used to determine the <b>instrument</b> <b>plumbing</b> time. Experimental results for scans across broad and narrow size distributions compare favorably with predictions based on the simulated transfer functions. Simplified corrections are provided {{that can be used to}} adjust the concentration and mobility of size distributions recovered using a fixed voltage transfer function...|$|R
