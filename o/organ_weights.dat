25|$|Fenitrothion {{is a kind}} of {{organophosphate}} and it {{can affect}} the development of reproductive system of male rats. Treatment with fenitrothion to male rats causes regression of androgen-dependent <b>organ</b> <b>weights</b> because fenitrothion is a potent competitive androgen receptor antagonist. Its effect on SDN-POA is different between male rats and female rats. In male rats, prenatal exposure to fenitrothion causes significantly increase of the volume of SDN-POA; whereas, in female rats, prenatal exposure to fenitrothion causes significantly decrease of the volume of SDN-POA. One possible explanation is that fenitrothion can alter the activity of aromatase, which then alters the level of estrogens converted by it from androgens and finally alters the volume of SDN-POA.|$|E

This evaluation has shown that analysis of organ-to-body weight ratios is predictive for evaluating liver and thyroid gland weights, and organ-to-brain weight ratios is predictive for evaluating ovary and adrenal gland weights.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{determine}} whether {{the central nervous system}} is involved in the effect of Chinese herbal medicine on sexual function recovery in orchidectomized rats. MethodsOrchidectomized rats were administered intragastrically with a decoction of “kidney-nourishing” Chinese herbal medicine once per day for 28 days. Accessory genital <b>organ</b> <b>weight,</b> plasma testosterone, and mating behavior were investigated. The expression of c-Fos and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in neuronal cells in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. ResultsThere was a decrease in accessory genital <b>organ</b> <b>weight,</b> plasma testosterone, and sexual behavior, as well as a low number of c-Fos-positive cells and a large nNOS-positive cell area in orchidectomized rats. Administration of the herbal medicine increased accessory genital <b>organ</b> <b>weight,</b> testosterone level, mating behavior, and c-Fos-positive cell number, while it decreased the nNOS-positive cell area in orchidectomized rats. ConclusionAn increase of plasma testosterone after administration of “kidney-nourishing” herbal medicine might contribute to the elevated sexual function and activity in orchidectomized rats.

40|$|The {{contribution}} that pleiotropic effects of individual loci make to covariation among traits is well understood theoretically and is becoming well documented empirically. However, {{little is known}} about the role of epistasis in determining patterns of covariation among traits. To address this problem we combine a quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis with a two-locus model to assess the contribution of epistasis to the genetic architecture of variation and covariation of <b>organ</b> <b>weights</b> and limb bone lengths in a backcross population of mice created from the M 16 i and CAST/Ei strains. Significant epistasis was exhibited by 14 pairwise combinations of QTL for <b>organ</b> <b>weights</b> and 10 combinations of QTL for limb bone lengths, which contributed, on average, about 5 % of the variation in <b>organ</b> <b>weights</b> and 8 % in limb bone lengths beyond that of single-locus QTL effects. Epistatic pleiotropy was much more common in the limb bones (seven of 10 epistatic combinations affecting limb bone lengths were pleiotropic) than the organs (three of the 14 epistatic combinations affecting <b>organ</b> <b>weights</b> were pleiotropic). In both cases, epistatic pleiotropy was less common than single-locus pleiotropy. Epistatic pleiotropy accounted for an average of 6 % of covariation among <b>organ</b> <b>weights</b> and 21 % of covariation among limb bone lengths, which represented an average of one-fifth (for <b>organ</b> <b>weights)</b> and one-third (for limb bone lengths) of the total genetic covariance between traits.
