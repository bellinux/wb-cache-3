25|$|Age {{plays an}} {{important}} role in one's internal and external locus of control. When comparing a young child and an <b>older</b> <b>adult</b> with their levels of locus of control in regards to health, the older person will have more control over their attitude and approach to the situation. As people age they become aware of the fact that events outside of their own control happen and that other individuals can have control of their health outcomes.|$|E
25|$|Promoting {{independence}} in self-care can provide {{older adults with}} the capability to maintain independence longer and can leave them {{with a sense of}} achievement when they complete a task unaided. Older adults that require assistance with activities of daily living are at a greater risk of losing their independence with self-care tasks as dependent personal behaviours are often met with reinforcement from caregivers. It is important for caregivers to ensure that measures are put into place to preserve and promote function rather than contribute to a decline in status in an <b>older</b> <b>adult</b> that has physical limitations. Caregivers need to be conscious of actions and behaviors that cause older adults to become dependent on them and need to allow older patients to maintain as much independence as possible. Providing information to the older patient on why it is important to perform self-care may allow them to see the benefit in performing self-care independently. If the <b>older</b> <b>adult</b> is able to complete self-care activities on their own, or even if they need supervision, encourage them in their efforts as maintaining independence can provide them with a sense of accomplishment and the ability to maintain independence longer.|$|E

Continu-ous responding tasks were conducted with 27 younger <b>adults</b> and 39 <b>older</b> <b>adults.</b> The results indicated the following: (a) response type significantly affected error rates in <b>older</b> <b>adults,</b> (b) the presentation of an auditory stimulus facilitated responses and decreased reaction times in both younger and <b>older</b> <b>adults,</b> (c) the presentation of an auditory stimulus also increased error rates in <b>older</b> <b>adults,</b> and (d) the effect of response type on error rate remained in experiments conducted under different conditions in <b>older</b> <b>adults.</b> This suggests that in <b>older</b> <b>adults,</b> movement and the associated nervous excitation have significant effects on motor inhibition...|$|R
40|$|Background: Although {{memory for}} future {{intentions}} (prospective memory, PM) is compromised in <b>older</b> <b>adults</b> with cognitive impairment, {{the effectiveness of}} specific training techniques to help these <b>older</b> <b>adults</b> with PM tasks remains unclear. Objective: The present study examined the effectiveness of spaced retrieval (rehearsing at increasingly spaced intervals) as an intervention for improving PM in cognitively impaired <b>older</b> <b>adults.</b> Methods: Healthy <b>older</b> <b>adults</b> (n = 40) and cognitively impaired <b>older</b> <b>adults</b> (n = 30) {{were randomly assigned to}} either a spaced retrieval or a standard rehearsal condition. Results: Whilst both groups benefited from the spaced retrieval intervention, enhancement effects were substantial for the cognitively impaired <b>older</b> <b>adults,</b> and no main effect of group was observed in this condition. Conclusion: These data indicate that spaced retrieval may be an effective means of helping cognitively impaired <b>older</b> <b>adults</b> maintain functional independence...|$|R

This finding influenced the decision to focus on familiarity and to investigate why <b>older</b> <b>adults</b> use products less intuitively than younger adults. By identifying and understanding the differences in familiarity, it is hypothesised that designers will be able to design more usable products for <b>older</b> <b>adults.</b> An empirical study was conducted, investigating the differences in familiarity between younger and <b>older</b> <b>adults</b> with contemporary products.

25|$|In 2010, {{experiments}} that have {{tested for the}} significance of under-performance of memory for an <b>older</b> <b>adult</b> group as compared to a young adult group, hypothesized that the deficit in associate memory due to age can be linked with a physical deficit. This deficit {{can be explained by}} the inefficient processing in the medial-temporal regions. This region is important in episodic memory, which is one of the two types of long-term human memory, and it contains the hippocampi, which are crucial in creating memorial association between items.|$|E
25|$|Nine gold beads {{were found}} in the grave of an <b>older</b> <b>adult</b> and a {{juvenile}} buried adjacent to a Terminal Archaic pit house. Charcoal recovered from the burial dates the gold beads to 2155-1936 cal BC, which makes them the earliest known gold artifacts in the Americas. The burial of the objects with the deceased implies the wealth and prestige of its owner through the disposal and remove from display and recirculation. The find bolsters the concept that metalworking developed from multiple independent technologies that were focused on native materials.|$|E
25|$|Stuttering is a multifaceted, complex {{disorder}} that can impact an individual’s {{life in a}} variety of ways. Children and adults are monitored and evaluated for evidence of possible social, psychological or emotional signs of stress related to their disorder. Some common assessments of this type measure factors including: anxiety (Endler multidimensional anxiety scales (EMAS)), attitudes (personal report of communication apprehension (PRCA)), perceptions of self (stutterers’ self-rating of reactions to speech situations (SSRSS)), quality of life (overall assessment of the speaker’s experience of stuttering (OASES)), behaviors (<b>older</b> <b>adult</b> self-report (OASR)), and mental health (composite international diagnostic interview (CIDI)).|$|E
40|$|Background: pre-discharge {{occupational}} therapy (OT) home visits {{are an integral}} part of the discharge process for <b>older</b> <b>adults</b> in acute care. There is limited quality research demonstrating that these pre-discharge visits enhance the health and well being of <b>older</b> <b>adults.</b> This paper outlines the perceptions of <b>older</b> <b>adults</b> and carers of the home visit process from the exploratory phase of an ongoing research project. Method: this qualitative study utilised 22 semi-structured interviews with 15 <b>older</b> <b>adults</b> and 7 carers. Data were analysed using thematic content analysis. Findings: <b>older</b> <b>adults</b> are not fully prepared to undertake home visits, but carers offer them reassurance about the discharge process. For carers, the home visit process appeared to eradicate anxiety, whilst some <b>older</b> <b>adults</b> perceived the process as demoralising, daunting and increasing their anxiety. In addition, <b>older</b> <b>adults</b> were often reluctant to accept changes or to have valued occupations stopped. Conclusion: the findings suggest that the current model of pre-discharge home visits does not promote health and well being. For some <b>older</b> <b>adults</b> the home visit provoked anxiety, however home visits are important to carers...|$|R

Measuring [...] in length, it has all-black plumage, beak and mouth, as well as strong grey-black legs and feet. The upperparts are glossy, with a purple, blue or green sheen, and its black feathers have grey bases. The Australian raven is distinguished from the Australian crow species by its throat hackles, which are prominent in adult birds. <b>Older</b> <b>adult</b> individuals have white irises, younger adults have a white irises with an inner blue rim, while younger birds have dark brown irises until fifteen months of age, and hazel irises with an inner blue rim around each pupil until age two years and ten months. Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Thomas Horsfield described the Australian raven in 1827, its species name highlighting its similarity with the carrion crow (C. corone). Two subspecies are recognised, which differ slightly in calls and are quite divergent genetically.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the first}} {{generation}} of law-enforced only-children came of age for becoming parents themselves, one adult child was left with having to provide support for his or her two parents and four grandparents. Called the [...] "4-2-1 Problem", this leaves the older generations with increased chances of dependency on retirement funds or charity in order to receive support. If personal savings, pensions, or state welfare fail, most senior citizens would be left entirely dependent upon their very small family or neighbours for assistance. If, for any reason, the single child is unable to care for their <b>older</b> <b>adult</b> relatives, the oldest generations would face a lack of resources and necessities.

2500|$|Unfortunately, Elderspeak {{is based}} on {{stereotypes}} and not actual behaviour of elders because it is used in situations where older adults are clearly functioning well.

[...] The use of elderspeak in more [...] “warmth” [...] and lower in a “superiority” dimension when the speaker was a family member and/or friend compared to an unfamiliar. Generally, young adults use an overstated version of elderspeak when addressing impaired older persons.

They speak more slowly and incorporate more pauses, however they do not use more repetition as young people do.
