5|$|In 1838, a {{man named}} Mr. Butler {{requested}} permission of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives to construct a tunnel or through cut through Nescopeck Mountain for the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, the Glen Summit Springs Hotel operated on top of Nescopeck Mountain. It was constructed by the Lehigh Valley Railroad Company. During its most active use, it attracted visitors from the Wyoming Valley and from the East Coast of the United States. The Lehigh Valley Railroad historically passed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge.</b> In the late 1800s, the ridge was prospected for coal.|$|E
5|$|The German {{troops were}} {{reluctant}} to attack head on once again, and Sergeant Vinz Kulbach pleaded with the officers of the 9th Fallschirmjäger Regiment to allow his men to flank the Americans in the dusk. Fifty men from Fusilier Regiment 27 of the 12th Volksgrenadier Division were dispatched to attack the American's southern flank through the woods. Just as Bouck was about to blow his whistle to indicate withdrawal, German soldiers penetrated their lines and began overrunning their foxholes. Several attackers were killed by grenades rigged to wires and triggered by Americans in their foxholes. Each of the positions spread out <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> top were overrun in turn. Surprisingly, the Germans did not simply kill the defenders in their foxholes. Bouck was pulled from his foxhole by an officer with a machine gun, {{and he thought he}} would be shot when the German put his weapon in his back and pulled the trigger; it was empty. Both Bouck and the German officer were then struck by bullets. The German fell seriously wounded, while Bouck was struck in the calf. Sergeant Kuhlbach asked Bouck who was in command, and Bouck replied that he was. Kuhlbach asked him why the Americans were still shooting, and Bouck said it was not his men doing it. Bouck surrendered and helped carry his wounded men down to the village.|$|E
25|$|Two tunnels {{also had}} to be built, at Braunston and Blisworth. The Blisworth Tunnel caused great problems, and was {{unfinished}} {{when the rest of}} the canal was ready. In fact Jessop considered abandoning it and using locks to carry the canal <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge.</b> Jessop's temporary solution was a railway line laid <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> to carry traffic until the tunnel was completed. The Grand Junction Canal was enormously important in encouraging trade between London and the Midlands.|$|E

5|$|When {{continental}} glaciers moved <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Rove Formation area, the ice was a {{hundreds of}} meters thick and its surface sloped gently southward from the Patrician center to the north. The {{base of the}} ice sheet encountered the cuesta topography relief {{of a few hundred}} feet. Because <b>the</b> ice <b>over</b> <b>the</b> valleys would be thicker than <b>the</b> ice <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridges,</b> obstructed extrusion flow would operate and resulted in the removal of the easily quarried slates of <b>the</b> valleys. <b>The</b> <b>ridges</b> would not be appreciably eroded, partly because the ice would be thinner <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> and therefore less plastic, and partly because of the resistance of the diabase to both quarrying and abrasion by the ice.|$|R

25|$|In the mid-1600s, English colonists {{were still}} {{uncertain}} of what lay beyond the Allegheny Mountains, whose topography and possession by native inhabitants, Tutelo-speaking tribes, were {{a barrier to}} expanded settlement by the Colony of Virginia. Abraham Wood, who commanded Fort Henry on the frontier (now the site of Petersburg, Virginia), and operated an Indian trading post nearby, organized several expeditions to explore farther west. A passage <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> was finally found in 1671 when explorers Batts and Fallam, sent by Wood, reached the present-day location of Blacksburg, Virginia. Their expedition followed Stroubles Creek, through the current locations {{of the town and}} campus of Virginia Tech to what they named Wood's River.|$|E
25|$|Resistance to the 3rd Marine Regiment advance was strong, {{with all}} three battalions engaged with the Japanese. The 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment—having crossed the Piva River without trouble—advanced toward a slight rise and as the lead scouts came {{over the top of}} this ridge, the Japanese opened fire from reverse slope {{positions}}. The scouts—having been pinned down—held their positions {{while the rest of the}} battalion moved forward with a strong charge <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> and cleared the area of Japanese. 90mm mortar fire then rained down on the Americans, who sheltered in the foxholes that the Japanese had dug throughout the area. Suffering a number of casualties, the 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment established itself in a defensive night position.|$|E

25|$|After 1891, {{the canal}} principally transported coal, and {{sometimes}} West Virginia limestone, wood, lumber, sand, and flour. (Statistics were only kept for coal.) Coal was loaded in the Cumberland basin, {{which consisted of}} dumping four carloads of coal into the boat. Some of the coal had to be shoveled by hand into the spaces beneath the cabins. During the loading process, nobody {{would be on the}} boat due to the dust, and mules were kept off, in case the boat sank from being loaded. Despite closing windows, dust usually entered the cabins. After loading, the ridge poles would be put, then the hatches <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> poles and openings. The crew would scrub down the boat (using water from the canal) to remove the dust, and the boat would be poled {{to the other side of}} the basin, where it would be hitched to the mules.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 609 BCE, Pharaoh Necho II led a sizable army up to the Euphrates River to aid the Assyrians against the Babylonians. Taking the coast route Via Maris into Syria {{at the head of}} a large army, {{consisting}} mainly of mercenaries, and supported by his Mediterranean fleet along the shore, Necho passed the low tracts of Philistia and Sharon. However, the passage <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> of hills which shuts in on the south of the great Jezreel Valley was blocked by the Judean army led by Josiah, who may have considered that the Assyrians and Egyptians were weakened by the death of the pharaoh Psamtik I only a year earlier (610 BCE), who had been appointed and confirmed by Assyrian kings Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal. Josiah attempted to block the advance at Megiddo, where a fierce battle was fought and Josiah was killed. Necho then joined forces with the Assyrian Ashur-uballit II and together they crossed the Euphrates and lay siege to Harran. The combined forces failed to capture the city, and Necho retreated to northern Syria.|$|E

500|$|Historians {{and writers}} {{disagree}} on the strategic significance of the battle, although most describe it as a British tactical and operational success. In 1919, Ludendorff wrote that the British victory cost the German army dear and drained German reserves. Hindenburg wrote that the losses at Messines had been [...] "very heavy" [...] and that he regretted that the ground had not been evacuated; in 1922, Kuhl called {{it one of the}} worst German tragedies of the war. In 1920 Haig's Dispatches described the success of the British plan, organisation and results but refrained from hyperbole, referring to the operation as a successful preliminary to the main offensive at Ypres. In 1930, Liddell Hart thought the success at Messines inflated expectations for the Third Battle of Ypres and that because the circumstances of the operations were different, attempts to apply similar tactics resulted in failure. In 1938 Lloyd George called the battle an apéritif and in 1939, G. C. Wynne judged it to be a [...] "brilliant success", overshadowed by the subsequent tragedy of the Battles of Passchendaele. The Official Historian called it a [...] "great victory" [...] in 1948 and Prior and Wilson (1997) called the battle a [...] "noteworthy success" [...] but then complained about the decision to postpone exploitation of the success on the Gheluvelt plateau. Ashley Ekins referred to the battle as a great set-piece victory, which was also costly, particularly for the infantry of II Anzac Corps, as did Christopher Pugsley, referring to the experience of the New Zealand Division. Heinz Hagenlücke called it a great British success and wrote that the loss of the ridge, had a worse effect on German morale than the number of casualties. Jack Sheldon called it a [...] "significant victory" [...] for the British and a [...] "disaster" [...] for the German army, which was forced into a [...] "lengthy period of anxious waiting". Brown in 1996 and Simpson in 2001 concluded that extending British supply routes <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge,</b> which had been devastated by the mines and millions of shells, to consolidate the Oosttaverne line and completion of the infrastructure further north in the Fifth Army area, was necessary before the Northern Operation (Third Battle of Ypres) could begin and was the main reason for the operational pause in June and July.|$|E
2500|$|After a British mine {{attack on}} 15 May, a German {{destructive}} bombardment {{on the ridge}} defences was accompanied by artillery registration (adjustments of aim by trial and error, directed by an observer in the air or on the ground) on the British communication trenches. In the five weeks before 21 May, the 25th Division (Major-General Beauchamp Doran) suffered [...] although the British miners were gradually gained an advantage over their German counterparts. The infantry thought that the Germans were going to attack but air reconnaissance found no signs of preparations. In the weeks before the German attack, the weather {{was so bad that}} reconnaissance flights <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> by the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> had been possible on only ten days.

British military intelligence took the view that the Germans lacked the infantry and artillery necessary for an attack and the transfer of divisions from the First, Second and Third armies to reinforce the Fourth Army continued.|$|E
