5|$|After Urus {{release and}} Uru Lives demise, Cyan {{announced}} that new content would be added via expansion packs. The first, Uru: To D'ni, added the never-released Uru Live online content, thus focusing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> of the D'ni. Uru: The Path of the Shell, extended {{the story of}} Uru {{in the present and}} added multiple never-before-seen Ages. Unlike the first expansion pack, Uru: The Path of the Shell was not free, but was boxed and sold in stores. Uru, To Dni, and The Path of the Shell were also packaged together and sold as Uru: The Complete Chronicles.|$|E

5|$|Bruce Castle {{is now a}} museum, {{holding the}} {{archives}} of the London Borough of Haringey, and housing a permanent exhibition <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> present and future of Haringey and its predecessor boroughs, and temporary displays {{on the history of the}} area. Other exhibits include an exhibition on Rowland Hill and postal history, a significant collection of early photography, a collection of historic manorial documents and court rolls related to the area, and one of the few copies available for public reading of the Spurs Opus, the complete history of Tottenham Hotspur. In 1949, the building was Grade I listed; the round tower was separately Grade I listed at the same time, and the 17th-century southern and western boundary walls of the park were Grade II listed in 1974. In 1969 the castle became home to the regimental museum of the Middlesex Regiment whose collection was subsequently transferred to the National Army Museum.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- In this paper, a new {{direction}} of arrival (DOA) estimation algorithm, direction lock loop (DiLL), is proposed. It has a similar concept to the delay lock loop (DLL) that is used for synchronization. It estimates the DOA of a signal by iterations, and can track the DOA of a moving source. The DiLL scheme is found to track better than the DOA estimation scheme based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>PASTd,</b> and its performance is less sensitive to the DOA of a signal {{than that of the}} DOA estimation scheme based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>PASTd.</b> <b>The</b> DOA estimation accuracy and the tracking capability are demonstrated by analysis and computer simulations.

5|$|The {{negotiations}} were first mentioned publicly in 1949 when Stephen Clissold published his Whirlwind: An Account of Marshal Tito's Rise to Power. This was closely followed by Wilhelm Höttl's Die Geheime Front, Organisation, Personen und Aktionen des deutschen Geheimdienstes (The Secret Front, the Organisation, People and Activities of the German Secret Service) in 1950. There was another mention {{in a book}} published in German in 1956, Generalmajor Rudolf Kiszling's Die Kroaten. Der Schicksalsweg eines Südslawenvolkes (The Croats: The Fateful Path of the South Slav People). Ilija Jukić obtained evidence from German Foreign Ministry sources, which he included in his 1965 book Pogledi na prošlost, sadašnjost i budućnost hrvatskog narodna (Views <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Past,</b> Present and Future of the Croatian Nation), published in London. In 1967, the Yugoslav historian Mišo Leković was officially commissioned to produce a full report on the talks. In 1969, Ivan Avakumović published his Mihailović prema nemačkim dokumentima (Mihailović according to German documents), which used captured German military documents.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the pool}} halls in 1870s Pittsburgh also {{broadcast}} horse races via telegraph. The often colorful race descriptions soon captured young Smith's attention and he wrote down and stockpiled the names and times of the winning horses for a year to form crude racing charts. In the fall of 1879, Smith placed his first bet on a 5:1 odds horse named Gabriel running in a race at the Brighton Beach racetrack at Coney Island. He won $38 when the horse won by 2 lengths but did not show any outward signs of emotion while the race was run. Determined that he could win at horse racing, Smith quit {{his job at the}} cork factory and accrued more than $5,000 from betting on horse races in the next two years, hiding the proceeds under his mattress at home. Upon his mother eventually discovering the money, he reasoned with her that he was not really gambling because he was making logical predictions based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> performances of horses and not merely guessing. By 1885, Smith had {{become one of the most}} touted gamblers in Pittsburgh and had won over $100,000 without ever seeing a horse race run firsthand. However, Smith was becoming too famous in Pittsburgh. He could not maintain the favorable, high odds when placing bets that he had attained earlier in his career when he was a virtual unknown because everyone in the crowd would lower the odds by betting his choices.|$|E
5|$|While neo-Keynesians {{integrated}} Keynes's {{ideas with}} neoclassical theory, post-Keynesians went in other directions. Post-Keynesians opposed the neoclassical synthesis and shared a fundamentalist interpretation of Keynes {{that sought to}} develop economic theories without classical elements. The core of post-Keynesian belief is the rejection of three axioms that are central to classical and mainstream Keynesian views: the neutrality of money, gross substitution, and the ergodic axiom. Post-Keynesians not only reject the neutrality {{of money in the}} short-run, they also see money as an important factor in the long-run, a view other Keynesians dropped in the 1970s. Gross substitution implies that goods are interchangeable. Relative price changes cause people to shift their consumption in proportion to the change. The ergodic axiom asserts that the future of the economy can be predicted based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> and present market conditions. Without the ergodic assumption, agents are unable to form rational expectations, undermining new classical theory. In a non-ergodic economy, predictions are very hard to make and decision-making is hampered by uncertainty. Partly because of uncertainty, post-Keynesians take a different stance on sticky prices and wages than new Keynesians. They do not see nominal rigidities as an explanation for the failure of markets to clear. They instead think sticky prices and long-term contracts anchor expectations and alleviate uncertainty that hinders efficient markets. Post Keynesian economic policies emphasize the need to reduce uncertainty in the economy including safety nets and price stability. Hyman Minsky applied post-Keynesian notions of uncertainty and instability to a theory of financial crisis where investors increasingly take on debt until their returns can no longer pay the interest on leveraged assets, resulting in a financial crisis. The financial crisis of 2007–2008 brought mainstream attention to Minsky's work.|$|E
