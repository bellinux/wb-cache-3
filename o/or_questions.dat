25|$|After {{determining}} {{that the subject}} is cooperative, the reader will make a number of probing statements <b>or</b> <b>questions,</b> typically using variations of the methods noted below.

25|$|The Quran was {{revealed}} {{over a period}} of nearly twenty three years. Muslim scholars agree that the revelations of the Quran can be divided into two broad types: One type includes passages of the Quran which were revealed in response to specific events, incidents <b>or</b> <b>questions</b> put forward to Muhammad. The second type includes passages of the Quran which were not direct responses to any historical or social development {{in the life of the}} Muslim community. A thorough understanding of the first type of passages, therefore, depend on knowing the circumstances of the events which occasioned them. Such knowledge is an important tool for explaining the meanings of this type of Quranic verses.|$|E
25|$|Psychologists Jack Block and Jeanne Block {{evaluated}} Genie in February 1971 and put {{her language}} below the two-year-old level on the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale. During the next month her vocabulary acquisition began to accelerate at a progressively more rapid pace, with observers putting her active vocabulary at over 100 words. Doctors noted that she seemed to know far more words than she would spontaneously say, but {{could not be sure}} about the extent of either her receptive or expressive vocabulary because she was so responsive to nonverbal stimuli. After another month, Genie began spontaneously producing one-word utterances and began to understand increasingly complex sentences. Soon after she appeared to understand some basic elements of the give-and-take nature of conversation, and without prompting could provide non-imitative one-word responses to statements <b>or</b> <b>questions.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although Chu Ci is an {{anthology}} of poems by many poets, Qu Yuan was its central figure, both as author of the seminally important Li sao section and in the persona of protagonist. There are various other authors which are also thought to have written various sections of the Chu Ci, {{as well as some}} sections which may derive from some traditional source. Various scholarly sources propose solutions for who wrote what, in the Chu Ci, with more doubt <b>or</b> <b>questions</b> about some sections than others. Besides the actual authorship of the diverse material of the Chu Ci, another scholarly concern is in regard to the history of who and when these pieces were collected and anthologized into one work, and also what other editorial work was done. Besides the authorship of the actual content, much commentary has been written in regard to the Chu Ci, some of which is traditionally incorporated into the printed editions.|$|E

2500|$|The Buddha {{then asked}} all the {{attendant}} Bhikkhus to clarify any doubts <b>or</b> <b>questions</b> they had and cleared {{them all in}} a way which others could not do. They had none. According to Buddhist scriptures, he then finally entered Parinirvana. The Buddha's final words are reported to have been: [...] "All composite things (Saṅkhāra) are perishable. Strive for your own liberation with diligence" [...] (Pali: 'vayadhammā saṅkhārā appamādena sampādethā'). His body was cremated and the relics were placed in monuments or stupas, some of which are believed to have survived until the present. For example, the Temple of the Tooth or [...] "Dalada Maligawa" [...] in Sri Lanka is the place where what some believe to be the relic of the right tooth of Buddha is kept at present.|$|E
2500|$|A koan (literally [...] "public case") is a {{story or}} dialogue, {{generally}} related to Chan or other Buddhist history; the most typical form is an anecdote involving early Chinese Chan masters. These anecdotes involving famous Chan teachers are a practical demonstration of their wisdom, {{and can be used}} to test a student's progress in Chan practice. Koans often appear to be paradoxical or linguistically meaningless dialogues <b>or</b> <b>questions.</b> But to Chan Buddhists the koan is [...] "the place and the time and the event where truth reveals itself" [...] unobstructed by the oppositions and differentiations of language. Answering a koan requires a student to let go of conceptual thinking and of the logical way we order the world, so that, like creativity in art, the appropriate insight and response arises naturally and spontaneously in the mind.|$|E
