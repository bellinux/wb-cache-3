25|$|Reminiscent of {{the season}} three cliffhanger, a mysterious figure enters the Ewing Oil {{building}} late one night. Proceeding to J.R.'s office, the figure produces a gun and fires three shots {{into the back of}} J.R.'s chair in which somebody is sitting. As the victim falls <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> and to the ground, we see it is Bobby Ewing that has been shot.|$|E
25|$|The {{man in the}} {{wheelchair}} says he too once {{had the support of}} a woman “to get me <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> in the evening and back into it again in the morning and to push me as far as the corner when I went out of my mind.” He also had a son, Billy, and begins calling the blind man by that name. He proposes the two of them join forces to unite sight and mobility in the interests of survival. The blind man is tempted by the other’s offer to locate some tinned food. The prospect of chancing across some “baked beans” especially excites him.|$|E
500|$|During {{production}} of the fourth season, Beaver joined the limited series Harper's Island. Although he initially feared that it would prevent future appearances of Bobby, {{he was able to}} maintain his Supernatural [...] "quota" [...] with seven episodes. The character's role increased for the fifth season, which made sense for the actor due to the apocalyptic storyline. The season also introduced a new story arc for Bobby: his use of a wheelchair. Series creator Eric Kripke explained that it [...] " [...] the Apocalypse matter"; the writers wanted [...] "real stakes and real loss and real obstacles thrown in our heroes' way" [...] to differentiate it from prior seasons. Though he found it to be a challenge, Beaver enjoyed the experience because he could perform tricks on set that his wheelchair-using college roommate had taught him. However, the actor did [...] " [...] very seriously", and commented, [...] "I can get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> {{at the end of the}} day and go home and I recognize that, so many people can't and I have to be considerate to them and respect that." ...|$|E

60|$|It was a {{weak and}} shaken voice, {{and it was}} a weak and shaken man that pulled himself <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Morris <b>chair.</b> He started toward the door.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your nose is {{as red as}} that {{cranberry}} sauce," [...] answered Fan, coming <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> big <b>chair</b> {{where she}} had been curled up for an hour or two, deep in [...] "Lady Audley's Secret." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Breathing" [...] {{was directed by}} Colin Tilley and premiered exclusively on PopCrush.com on November 3, 2011. The video begins with Derulo {{on the balcony of}} a building at night, as well as scenes of him sitting in an old chair surrounded by cobwebs inside an industrial warehouse. There are then scenes which feature Derulo standing shirtless in a dark, blue-tinted room, digitally showing the insides of his body to show the intensity of his emotion. After the first chorus, Derulo then rises <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> and begins to dance. During the bridge, Derulo is shown kissing his former love interest, before several female backup dancers join him to perform choreography in the final chorus. Aaron-Spencer Charles of Metro noted that the video had [...] "some impressive footwork and a great 'straight jacket' dance move with the choreographed piece with female dancers." [...] A reviewer for 4Music also praised Derulo's dance routines in the video. Contessa Gayles of AOL Music described the video as [...] "creepy" [...] and compared it to Rihanna's [...] "Disturbia" [...] (2008) video.|$|E
2500|$|The next night, after a {{complaint}} {{from the school}} teacher, his father ruthlessly tested him for spelling, eventually knocking {{him out of his}} chair with exasperation. [...] At that point, Cayce 'heard' the voice of the lady who had appeared the day before. [...] She told him that if he could sleep a little 'they' could help him. [...] He begged for a rest and put his head on the spelling book. [...] When his father came back into the room and woke him up, he knew all the answers. [...] In fact, he could repeat anything in the book. [...] His father thought he had been fooling before and knocked him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> again. [...] Eventually, Cayce used all his school books that way.|$|E
2500|$|The Manchester {{performance}} was widely bootlegged (and mistakenly {{placed at the}} Royal Albert Hall). The recording of this gig {{became one of the}} most famous of Dylan's career. In a 1971 review for Creem magazine, critic Dave Marsh wrote, [...] "My response is that crystallization of everything that is rock'n'roll music, at its finest, was to allow my jaw to drop, my body to move, to leap <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> ... It is an experience that one desires simply to share, to play over and over again for those he knows thirst for such pleasure. If I speak in an almost worshipful sense about this music, it is not because I have lost perspective, it is precisely because I have found it, within music, yes, that was made five years ago. But it is there and unignorable." [...] When it finally saw [...] in 1998, critic Richie Unterberger declared the record [...] "an important document of rock history." ...|$|E
60|$|Barton nearly leaped <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his <b>chair,</b> <b>the</b> client's <b>chair,</b> so sudden a light {{flashed on}} him.|$|R
50|$|In May 2007, Parsons {{announced}} {{his intention to}} phase himself <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anchor <b>chair</b> at <b>the</b> News Hour, with plans to work Tuesdays and Wednesdays until the 2010 Winter Olympics, after which he had stated his intention to retire and make documentaries.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wow! All to the merry!" [...] cried Phil, and leaping <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> willow <b>chair</b> he occupied, {{he turned}} a [...] "cart-wheel" [...] on the lawn. [...] "Say, this fits in {{better than a}} set of new teeth, doesn't it?" [...] he went on, enthusiastically.|$|R
2500|$|Some years later, when Samuel {{has become}} an adult, the Philistines attack Eben-Ezer, {{eventually}} capturing the Ark of the Covenant from the Israelites and kill Eli's sons, who accompany the Ark to battle as priests. (The Israelites had brought the Ark with them to battle under the premise {{that there was no}} possible way God would allow it to enter enemy hands, an assumption that proved to be incorrect.) Eli, who is nearly blind, is unaware of the event until he asks about all the commotion. Eli, sitting in a chair, is told what has happened by a soldier who has fled the battle. In reaction to the news that the Ark of God has been captured, Eli falls backwards <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> and dies from a broken neck, on the 10th day of Iyar. [...] He was a Judge of Israel for a total of 40 years, and dies at the age of 98. His daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, is pregnant and near the time of delivery. When she hears the news that the Ark of God has been captured and that her father-in-law and husband are dead, she goes into labour and gives birth, but is overcome by labour pains. As she is dying, the women attending her say, Don't despair; you have given birth to a son. But she does not respond or pay any attention. She names the boy Ichabod, saying The Glory has departed from Israel- because of the capture of the Ark of God and the deaths of her father-in-law and her husband.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Short fairly bounded <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> in exultation, and then, {{struck by}} another thought, sank {{back into it}} again.|$|E
60|$|This {{time the}} shaft went home. Galliard sprang <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair,</b> his brows darkening, and his cheeks pale beyond their wont.|$|E
6000|$|He pondered {{for some}} minutes, {{and then he}} cried out for some more brandy. There was a small bottle <b>of</b> {{laudanum}} upon <b>the</b> table, and I managed, by insisting upon helping him myself, to mix about half a drachm with the spirits. He drank it off, and sank his head once more upon the pillow. [...] "Anything better than that," [...] he groaned. [...] "Death is better than that. Crime and cruelty; cruelty and crime. Anything is better than that," [...] and so on, with the monotonous refrain, until at last the words became indistinct, his eyelids closed over his weary eyes, and he sank into a profound slumber. I carried him into his bedroom without arousing him; and making a couch for myself <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chairs,</b> I remained by his side all night.|$|R
50|$|Mad River Glen {{is known}} for its tree skiing. Mad River's most {{difficult}} marked trail is a steep, rocky, thin, and usually icy path down from <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountain called Paradise. To embark, skiers hike over and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> lift. <b>The</b> entrance to the trail is not marked, although in 2004 it was added to the official trail map. The first pitch features mandatory air over a four foot (1.3 m) high frozen waterfall that spans <b>the</b> full width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trail.|$|R
60|$|As {{he pushed}} open the door a young fellow got <b>out</b> <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chairs</b> and paid <b>the</b> barber what was coming to him. Then he reached for his hat and started to leave.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here is your chair!" [...] Mrs. March {{called to}} her, drawing the shawl <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> next her own. [...] "Mr. March is {{wandering}} about the ship somewhere." ...|$|E
60|$|He jumped <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> as if I {{had put a}} {{knife into}} him, and struck his fist on the table so heavily that the wood cracked again.|$|E
60|$|He heaved himself <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair,</b> {{and left}} the room. Ann, {{coming down from the}} gallery, found Jimmy meditating. He looked up at the sound of her step.|$|E
50|$|The magistrates who compose it are {{the same}} as those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> siège (<b>chair).</b> Generally a magistrate, in <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> his career, will carry <b>out</b> <b>the</b> {{functions}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> as well as <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parquet.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite {{strong enough}} for that, miss!" [...] cried Charley. But Charley's face fell in <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> her delight, for {{she saw the}} secret in MY face; and she came <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great <b>chair,</b> and fell upon my bosom, and said [...] "Oh, miss, it's my doing! It's my doing!" [...] {{and a great deal}} more <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{fullness}} <b>of</b> her grateful heart.|$|R
60|$|I gazed {{about the}} mean room, with its litter of {{newspapers}} and reports, its shabby furniture, and these {{seemed to have}} become incongruous, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> figure in <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> facing me keeping with the thoughtful figure in <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> facing me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll fix it;" [...] and Ben went up {{the pine}} like a squirrel, tied a stout knot, and swung himself down again before Thorny could get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Almost with a {{galvanic}} spring, the Ancient Mariner was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> {{and on his}} feet, {{the anger}} of age and of a generous soul in {{his face as he}} cried: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah!' said Mrs Gamp, coming <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> with an {{impatient}} shiver; 'I thought I was a-sleepin' too pleasant to last! The devil's in the night, I think, it's turned so chilly!' ...|$|E
60|$|The clock struck six and, having {{swept up}} the hearth, Beth put {{a pair of}} {{slippers}} down to warm. Somehow <b>the</b> sight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old shoes had a good effect upon the girls, for Mother was coming, and everyone brightened to welcome her. Meg stopped lecturing, and lighted the lamp, Amy got <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> easy <b>chair</b> without being asked, and Jo forgot how tired she was as she sat up to hold the slippers nearer to the blaze.|$|R
60|$|Captain Anthony {{had stopped}} for a moment staring ahead from <b>the</b> break <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poop, and poor Flora sent at his back a look of despairing appeal which would have moved a heart of stone. But as though she had done nothing he did not stir in the least. She got <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long <b>chair</b> and went towards the companion. Her father {{followed}} carrying a few small objects, a handbag, her handkerchief, a book. They went down together.|$|R
6000|$|The {{effect on}} Brassey in the drawing-room cannot be conceived, much less described. He shot, as it were, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crimson-gilded <b>chair</b> and {{overturned}} <b>the</b> lamp, which burst on the floor. Being half full of paraffin oil it instantly {{set fire to}} the gauze window-curtains. The burglar made straight for the stairs. John Waters, observing the light, dashed up the same, and the two met face to face on the landing, breathing hate and glaring defiance! ...|$|R
60|$|She {{shook him}} gently, {{and he sat}} up with a start, {{blinking}} in the strong light. His mouth was still open. He stared at Sally foolishly, then scrambled awkwardly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|E
6000|$|He {{states that}} he entered a hair-dresser's in Paris to get shaved, and the first [...] "rake" [...] the barber gave him with his razor it LOOSENED HIS [...] "HIDE" [...] and LIFTED HIM <b>OUT</b> <b>OF</b> <b>THE</b> <b>CHAIR.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a good plan," [...] said McGinty. [...] "The lodge will owe you a {{debt for}} this. I guess when I move <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> I {{can put a}} name to the man that's coming after me." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. George {{said this}} in a very quiet manner, and then {{proceeded}} to help Rosie <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her <b>chair.</b> <b>The</b> guide who had come up the mountain with them then led the way, and Mr. George, Rollo, Rosie and Josie followed, towards the crater.|$|R
2500|$|The {{film was}} not {{successful}} {{at the box}} office, with some even calling it a fiasco. Different reasons have been given for its failure with the public; for some, Buñuel was forced to make concessions to <b>the</b> bad taste <b>of</b> his stars, particularly Negrete, others cite Buñuel's rusty technical skills [...] and lack of confidence {{after so many years}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> director's <b>chair,</b> while still others speculate that Mexican audiences were tiring of genre movies, called [...] "churros", that were perceived as being cheaply and hastily made.|$|R
5000|$|One {{incident}} Schuler {{is remembered}} for {{occurred at the}} first press conference that introduced him as <b>the</b> coach <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Trail Blazers, when he fell <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his <b>chair.</b> <b>The</b> footage was seen often on American television in the following days, and Schuler termed it [...] "my instant claim to fame." ...|$|R
