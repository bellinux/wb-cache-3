25|$|Although optical devices {{also used}} for {{continuous}} light, like beam expanders and spatial filters, {{may be used for}} ultrashort pulses, several optical devices have been specifically designed for ultrashort pulses. One of them is the pulse compressor, a device {{that can be used to}} control the spectral phase of ultrashort pulses. It is composed of a sequence of prisms, or gratings. When properly adjusted it can alter the spectral phase φ(ω) of the input pulse so that the <b>output</b> <b>pulse</b> is a bandwidth-limited pulse with the shortest possible duration. A pulse shaper can be used to make more complicated alterations on both the phase and the amplitude of ultrashort pulses.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two main}} {{limitations}} of the Geiger counter. Because the <b>output</b> <b>pulse</b> from a Geiger-Müller tube is always of the same magnitude regardless of {{the energy of the}} incident radiation, the tube cannot differentiate between radiation types. A further limitation is the inability to measure high radiation rates due to the [...] "dead time" [...] of the tube. This is an insensitive period after each ionization of the gas during which any further incident radiation will not result in a count, and the indicated rate is, therefore, lower than actual. Typically the dead time will reduce indicated count rates above about 104 to 105 counts per second depending on the characteristic of the tube being used. Whilst some counters have circuitry which can compensate for this, for accurate measurements ion chamber instruments are preferred for high radiation rates.|$|E

50|$|The {{intensity}} of the signal is obtained by counting (photon counting) the number of <b>output</b> <b>pulses</b> within a measurement time slot, while the time-dependent waveform of the signal is obtained by measuring the time distribution of the <b>output</b> <b>pulses</b> (photon timing). The latter is obtained by means of operating the Single Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) detector in Time Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) mode.|$|R

40|$|A Q-switched dual-wavelength {{fiber laser}} using a {{graphene}} oxide-based saturable absorber {{to generate the}} desired <b>output</b> <b>pulses</b> is proposed and demonstrated. The system utilizes a singlemode-multimode-singlemode fiber structure to control the net losses in the cavity so that only two dominant wavelengths are allowed to oscillate. The proposed system is capable of generating an output with a high repetition rate of 27. 1 kHz and a narrow pulse width of 4. 03 μs. The <b>output</b> <b>pulses</b> also have average <b>output</b> power and <b>pulse</b> energy of up to 0. 5 mW and 18. 5 nJ, respectively.

50|$|A pulse shaper may be visualized as a modulator. The input pulse is multiplied with a {{modulating}} {{function to}} get a desired <b>output</b> <b>pulse.</b> The modulating function in pulse shapers may be in time domain or a frequency domain (obtained by Fourier Transform of time profile of pulse). However, application of direct pulse shaping technique on a femtosecond time scale faces the same problem as direct femtosecond pulse measurement: electronics speed limitations. Michelson interferometer {{can be regarded as}} direct space-to-time pulse shaper since position of the moving mirror is directly transferred to the inter-pulse delay of the <b>output</b> <b>pulse</b> pair.|$|E
50|$|A {{monostable}} multivibrator is an electronic circuit that generates an <b>output</b> <b>pulse.</b> When triggered, a pulse of pre-defined duration is produced. The circuit then returns to its quiescent state and produces no more output until triggered again.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} double {{unbalanced}} Michelson interferometer producing up to 4 <b>output</b> <b>pulses</b> {{from a single}} input pulse. The interferometer is stabilized with the Hänsch-Couillard method using an auxiliary low power continuous wave laser injected into the interferometer, allowing the stabilization of the temporal jitter of the <b>output</b> <b>pulses</b> to 0. 02 fs. Such stabilized pulse trains would be suitable for driving multi-pulse laser wakefield accelerators and the technique could be extended to include amplification {{in the arms of}} the interferometer...|$|R
50|$|While {{in theory}} a DAC outputs {{a series of}} {{discrete}} Dirac impulses, in practice, a real DAC <b>outputs</b> <b>pulses</b> with finite bandwidth and width. Both idealized Dirac pulses, zero-order held steps and other <b>output</b> <b>pulses,</b> if unfiltered, would contain spurious high-frequency content {{when compared to the}} original signal. Thus, the reconstruction filter smooths the waveform to remove image frequencies (copies) above the Nyquist limit. In doing so, it reconstructs the continuous time signal (whether originally sampled, or modelled by digital logic) corresponding to the digital time sequence.|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} unpolarized laser pulses shaping is reported.

A sample of the input light constrols, by an asymmetrical electronic comparator, a 1 x 2 electro-optical total switch. The <b>output</b> <b>pulses</b> are reshaped and maintain the same polarization properties as the input light. From triangular input light signals, symmetriacl and asymmetrical <b>output</b> <b>pulses</b> have been obtained. The minimum pulse width achieved was 0. 1 msec.

5000|$|Upon command, a {{high voltage}} switch {{transfers}} the energy stored within the PFN into the load. When the switch [...] "fires" [...] (closes), {{the network of}} capacitors and inductors within the PFN creates an approximately square <b>output</b> <b>pulse</b> of short duration and high power. This high power pulse becomes a brief source of high power to the load.|$|E
5000|$|Assume {{that the}} mean value of the initial field is [...] Physically, the initial state {{corresponds}} to the coherent pulse at the input of the optical amplifier; the final state corresponds to the <b>output</b> <b>pulse.</b> The amplitude-phase behavior of the pulse must be known, although only the quantum state of the corresponding mode is important.

50|$|The first switch may {{be allowed}} to spontaneously break down (sometimes called a self break) during {{charging}} if the absolute timing of the <b>output</b> <b>pulse</b> is unimportant. However, it is usually intentionally triggered once all the capacitors in the Marx bank have reached full charge, either by reducing the gap distance, by pulsing an additional trigger electrode (such as a Trigatron), by ionising {{the air in the}} gap using a pulsed laser, or by reducing the air pressure within the gap.|$|E
40|$|The on-line winding {{test unit}} determines a {{characteristic}} signature of a monitored winding(s) in a transformer, generator, or the like. A sensor detects incoming pulses, originating {{elsewhere on the}} energy delivery system, applied to the winding. A sensor detects <b>output</b> <b>pulses</b> after each input pulse has propagated through the winding. Data corresponding to the input and <b>output</b> <b>pulses</b> are stored. A processor computes the spectral densities of the data records. The logic then computes the characteristic signature, H(f), for the winding such that H(f) equals the average of Gxy divided by the average of Gxx for the valid data.

50|$|Sometimes a {{specially}} designed pulse transformer is connected between the PFN and load. This technique improves the impedance match between the PFN and the load so as to improve power transfer efficiency. A pulse transformer is typically required when driving higher impedance devices such as klystrons or magnetrons from a PFN. Because the PFN is charged over a relatively long time and then discharged over a very short time, the <b>output</b> <b>pulse</b> may have a peak power of megawatts or even terawatts.|$|E
