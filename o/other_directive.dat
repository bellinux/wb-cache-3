40|$|We {{tested the}} {{effectiveness}} of a Hidrostal pump and filtered mercury vapor light system was tested for attracting, concentrating, and transporting fish commonly impinged on water intake structures of thermal electric generating stations on the Great Lakes. In general, the Hidrostal pump effectively transported test fish with relatively low mortality rates. Mortality varied among fish species, with rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) significantly hardier than yellow perch (Perca flavescens) and alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus). Mortality also generally increased at higher pumping speeds, while mortality of yellow perch was greater in a long transport loop than in a short transport loop. In tests of fish attraction and capture, the addition of a filtered mercury vapor light significantly increased the efficiency of fish capture of the Hidrostal pump transport system. <b>Other</b> <b>directive</b> cues (bubble curtains, strobe lights, and electric fields) did not significantly improve the efficiency of the Hidrostal pump-mercury vapor light system.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a {{taxonomy}} of linguistic realisation strategies concerning the speech act of suggesting. In this regard, we will first provide a definition of this particular speech act, outlining its main characteristics and differentiating it from <b>other</b> <b>directive</b> speech acts, such as requests. Second, we will review the research conducted on suggestions by examining studies from both the cross-cultural and interlanguage pragmatics fields. Third, we will present the taxonomy we have drawn up on the basis of two theoretical frameworks, namely those of speech act and politeness theories, as well as findings from previous studies on this particular speech act. Finally, we will propose an example of a teaching approach in which this taxonomy could be implemented in order to develop learners' pragmatic competence when making suggestions. This study is part of a research project funded by (a) a grant from the Spanish Ministerio de Educación y Ciencia (HUM 2004 - 04435 /FILO), co-funded by FEDER, and (b) a grant from Fundado Universitat Jaume I and Caixa Castelló-Bancaixa (P 1. 1 B 2004 - 34) ...|$|E
40|$|These {{guidelines}} {{focus on}} the procurement of location information products and services, such as the acquisition of new location data to support applications, the acquisition of solutions for using location data and services in e Government processes and products and/or services for making data interoperable and/or accessible.

The guidelines provide recommendations on elements of best practice in procurement in which location information and location enabled services are important, with some practical examples; and describe some concrete sample texts {{that could be used in}} invitations to tender when reference is made to location information and location enabled service requirements.

40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the I wonder if you VP {{construction}} in English, with a special focus on its use for conveying a request as opposed to genuine information question. The paper has three aims: (i) to define the nature of request made with this construction {{from the viewpoint of}} the types of verbs that frequently appear; (ii) to characterize this directive construction {{within the framework of the}} 6 -parameter analysis of FORCE EXERTION (Takahashi 2012), a theory originally designed to capture the difference in illocutionary force among different imperative utterances; and (iii) to describe the ways in which this construction functions, and interacts with <b>other</b> <b>directive</b> constructions, in actual discourse. It is argued that I wonder if you is prototypically an information-seeking device when it is used as directive. Furthermore, quite unlike the expression I’d appreciate it if you (Takahashi 2014 b),its appearance is not restricted to the core or conclusive segment of directive discourse but rather the construction may occur in an introductory part of the entire directive discourse to communicate to the addressee that the speaker is about to make a request...|$|E

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Presidential Decision Directive 25 states that U. S. involvement in international peacekeeping operations must be selective and effective. Toward this end, the directive established guidance that U. S. officials must consider before deciding whether to support proposed operations, including whether the operations advanced U. S. interests, had realistic criteria for ending the operations, and had appropriate forces and financing to accomplish their missions. The directive established these factors as an aid for executive decision-making and not as criteria for supporting particular operations. Executive branch officials thoroughly considered all Presidential Decision Directive 25 factors before deciding to support the authorization or expansion of peacekeeping operations in East Timor, Sierra Leone, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. At the time the decisions were made, executive branch assessments identified at least one Directive 25 shortfall {{in all of the}} proposed operations and several shortfalls in six of them. Executive branch officials nonetheless decided to support the operations because they believed that these shortfalls were outweighed by the presence of <b>other</b> <b>Directive</b> 25 factors and various other factors, including U. S. interests in the region. Executive branch officials provided Congress with considerable information about the conflicts that the proposed operations were intended to address. However, GAO found no evidence that Congress was informed about most Directive 25 shortfalls identified in executive branch assessments of the proposed operations in East Timor and Sierra Leone or about U. S. plans to address the risks posed by these shortfalls. Congress was informed, about most shortfalls identified in executive branch assessments of the proposed U. N. operations in the Congo. ...|$|E
40|$|Swann's (1983, 1987, 1990) self-verification theory {{assumes that}} people are {{invested}} in preserving a stable and unchanging sense of self, {{and that they do}} so by interacting with others who treat them {{in a manner consistent with}} their sense of self. Deci and Ryan's (1985, 1987, 1991) self-determination theory assumes {{that people are}} intrinsically oriented towards seeking growth and progressive change in their sense of self, and that it is by interacting with others who support their autonomy that these growth strivings are best satisfied. Two pilot studies and three full-scale studies tested (a) whether self-consistency versus self-growth needs govern people's preferences for who they interact with, and (b) the kinds of consequences that ensue from such interactions. Globally, we hypothesized that if Swann's self-verification theory holds true, self-determined individuals will prefer to interact with others who are also self-determined in their motivation, and who are autonomy-supportive in their interpersonal style. Nonself-determined individuals, on the other hand, will prefer interactions with others who are nonself-determined in their motivation, and rather directive and controlling in their interpersonal style. By contrast, we anticipated that if Deci and Ryan's self-determination theory holds true, all persons, regardless of their motivational orientation, will prefer to interact with others who are relatively self-determined in their motivation and autonomy-supportive in their interpersonal style. In line with Swann's self-verification theory, results of Pilot Study 2, Study 2, and Study 3 indicated that subjects preferred to interact with others who were similar to themselves. Specifically, when we examined the similarity between university students and their two closest university friends in terms of their motivation for attending school, findings indicated that self-determined students preferred to associate with friends who were significantly more self-determined than the friends of nonself-determined students (Pilot Study 2, Study 2). Similarly, when we examined married and common-law couples' motivation for being involved in their relationship, a significant correlation emerged between their motivational orientations (Study 3). In both cases, the pattern of results held up whether we considered actual motivation similarity or perceived motivation similarity between subjects and their relationship partners. Despite the fact that subjects chose to affiliate with others similar to themselves, results of Pilot Study 1, Study 1, and Study 3, revealed that such types of interactions were not the kind that subjects would prefer to have, nor the kind that were associated with superior relationship outcomes. In line with Deci and Ryan's self-determination theory, when students were presented with descriptions of two types of teaching styles [...] one autonomy-supportive, the <b>other</b> <b>directive</b> and controlling [...] students of both motivational orientations indicated a clear preference for the autonomy-supportive teaching style (Pilot Study 1, Study 1). When asked which of the two teaching styles they considered to be more effective, students again judged the autonomy-supportive teaching style to be superior (Study 1). Finally, when couples were asked to rate the quality of their relationship, they reported greater adaptiveness in their couple behaviors, more commitment towards their relationship, and higher levels of happiness within their relationship to the extent that their motivation towards the relationship was self-determined and that their partner was perceived to be autonomy-supportive (Study 3). Results are discussed in terms of reconciling this apparent difference between what people seem to want (self-growth) and what people seem to do (self-consistency) ...|$|E
