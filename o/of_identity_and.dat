5|$|Even if {{an ancient}} and {{advanced}} extraterrestrial civilization wished to help humanity, humans could {{suffer from a}} loss <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> confidence due to the technological and cultural prowess of the extraterrestrial civilization. However, a friendly civilization may calibrate its contact with humanity {{in such a way}} as to minimize unintended consequences. Michael A. G. Michaud suggests that a friendly and advanced extraterrestrial civilization may even avoid all contact with an emerging intelligent species like humanity, to ensure that the less advanced civilization can develop naturally at its own pace; this is known as the zoo hypothesis.|$|E

40|$|This {{conceptual}} {{paper is}} guided by three objectives: First, to bolster the argument for organizational identity as a defined concept, as compared with a metaphor or paradigmatic perspective. Second, articulate a clearer and more fully developed connection between the concepts <b>of</b> individual <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> organizational <b>identity.</b> Third, specify a distinctive, defensible conceptual domain for the concept <b>of</b> organizational <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> align the definition <b>of</b> organizational <b>identity</b> with that domain. Guided by these objectives, we argue that the tension between being similar and different is a fundamental <b>and</b> distinguishing feature <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> – <b>and</b> that this “identity paradox” exists at both the individual and organizational levels. We then propose a two-dimensional form <b>of</b> this <b>identity</b> paradox <b>and</b> suggest that the resulting framework serve as the conceptual domain <b>of</b> organizational <b>identity.</b> In the end, we examine {{the implications of the}} proposed conceptual space for Albert and Whetten’s (1985) definition <b>of</b> organizational <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> propose two new definitional elements...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{examined}} face perception {{models with}} regard to the functional and temporal organization <b>of</b> facial <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> expression analysis. Participants performed a manual 2 -choice go/no-go task to classify faces, where response hand depended on facial familiarity (famous vs. unfamiliar) and response execution depended on facial expression (happy vs. angry). Behavioral and electrophysiological markers of information processing—in particular, the lateralized readiness potential (LRP) —were recorded to assess the time course <b>of</b> facial <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> expression processing. The duration <b>of</b> facial <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> expression processes was manipulated in separate experiments, which allowed testing the differential predictions of alternative face perception models. Together, the reaction time and LRP findings indicate a parallel architecture <b>of</b> facial <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> expression analysis in which the analysis of facial expression relies on information about identity...|$|R

25|$|Flemish feeling <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> {{consciousness}} grew {{through the}} events and experiences of war. The German occupying authorities viewed the Flemish as an oppressed people and had taken several Flemish-friendly measures, known as Flamenpolitik. This included introducing Dutch as the language of instruction of all state-supported schools in Flanders in 1918. This prompted a renewed Flemish movement {{in the years following}} the war. The Flemish Frontbeweging (Soldiers' Movement) was formed from Flemish soldiers in the Belgian army to campaign for greater use of Dutch language in education and government, though not separatist.|$|E
25|$|A Scanner Darkly is a 2006 American {{animated}} science-fiction thriller film {{directed by}} Richard Linklater, {{based on the}} novel of the same name by Philip K. Dick.

The film was shot digitally and then animated using interpolated rotoscope, an animation technique in which animators trace over the original footage frame by frame, for use in live-action and animated films, giving the finished result a distinctive animated look. It was distributed by Warner Independent Pictures.|$|E
25|$|According to {{lawyer and}} human rights activist K.

He opined that if only non-religious identities deserve support, then no national self-determination movement can be supported, because there is no national identity – at least in the Third World – devoid of the religious dimension. Balagopal says that if India and Pakistan cannot guarantee existence and peaceful development of independent Kashmir then Kashmiris may well choose Pakistan because of religious affinity and social and economic links. But if both can guarantee existence and peaceful development then most Kashmiris would prefer independent Kashmir.|$|E
