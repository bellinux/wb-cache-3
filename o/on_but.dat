5|$|After 1143 the war ground <b>on,</b> <b>but</b> {{progressing}} {{slightly better}} for Stephen. Miles of Gloucester, {{one of the}} most talented Angevin commanders, had died whilst hunting over the previous Christmas, relieving some of the pressure in the west. Geoffrey de Mandeville's rebellion continued until September 1144, when he died during an attack on Burwell. The war in the west progressed better in 1145, with the King recapturing Faringdon Castle in Oxfordshire. In the north, Stephen came to a fresh agreement with Ranulf of Chester, but then in 1146 repeated the ruse he had played on Geoffrey de Mandeville in 1143, first inviting Ranulf to court, before arresting him and threatening to execute him unless he handed over a number of castles, including Lincoln and Coventry. As with Geoffrey, the moment Ranulf was released he immediately rebelled, but the situation was a stalemate: Stephen had few forces in the north with which to prosecute a fresh campaign, whilst Ranulf lacked the castles to support an attack on Stephen. By this point, however, Stephen's practice of inviting barons to court and arresting them had brought him into some disrepute and increasing distrust.|$|E
5|$|Against Northamptonshire {{in one of}} {{the last}} games of the 1920 season, Surrey had passed Northamptonshire's score and were in a {{dominant}} position when Fender batted. He was dropped early <b>on</b> <b>but</b> batting in a carefree, aggressive style, reached 100 runs in 35 minutes, as of 2016 still the fastest individual century on record in first-class cricket. In total, he scored 113 not out and shared a partnership of 171 runs in 42 minutes with Alan Peach. Although acknowledged to be a fast innings, Fender's century was not recognised as a record at the time; cricket records were not widely kept or studied, and other innings were believed to have been quicker. Surrey {{went on to win the}} match.|$|E
5|$|Although the Chester Canal was not {{a success}} as traffic was sparse, this changed once it was {{connected}} to the Ellesmere Canal. The Ellesmere company expected to carry limestone from the quarries at Llanymynech and Trevor, iron from the ironworks at Ruabon and Bersham, and coal from mines at Chirk, Ruabon and Wrexham to Chester, Liverpool and Shrewsbury. The canal to Bersham and Wrexham was not built, and that to Shrewsbury was built much later <b>on,</b> <b>but</b> trade in coal, limestone, lime and building materials developed within the network of canals, and traffic between the canals and Liverpool increased steadily, much of it passing along the former Chester Canal. Receipts for the Ellesmere Canal were £12,568 in 1807 and £15,707 just two years later.|$|E

5|$|As it {{is clear}} that the demands of his job are taking a toll on Chris, Carla becomes {{increasingly}} uncomfortable with the brutal competition among firms and the violence they incite in other countries. Seeking an escape from Shorn and to save their marriage, Carla, with the help of her father, who lives in the London Zones, and her mother in Sweden, secures a position at the United Nations as an Ombudsman, a sort of outside auditor/investigator who attempts to enforce the UN's mandate across the world. This position is viewed as honourable but ultimately ineffective as neither the US nor UK recognise the UN's authority and run roughshod over them in their pursuit of profits. After an initially frosty meeting, Chris' conditions are agreed <b>on,</b> <b>but</b> with the requirement that he stay in place at Shorn through the end of the current conflict in Cambodia, in which Shorn is backing a rebel leader.|$|E
5|$|At {{its point}} of {{publication}} in July 2011, A Dance with Dragons {{was in its}} sixth print with more than 650,000 hardbacks in print. It also had the highest single and first-day sales of any new fiction title published in 2011 at that point, with 170,000 hardcovers, 110,000 e-books, and 18,000 audio books reportedly sold on the first day. A Dance with Dragons {{reached the top of}} The New York Times bestseller list on July 31, 2011. Unlike most other big titles, the fifth volume sold more physical than digital copies early <b>on,</b> <b>but</b> nevertheless, Martin became the tenth author to sell 1million Amazon Kindle e-books. All five volumes and the four-volume boxed set were among the top 100 best-selling books in the United States in 2011 and 2012.|$|E
5|$|Baseball had {{for some}} time been living uneasily in the {{knowledge}} that bribes were being offered by gamblers, and that some players were accepting them. The players knew it was going on, and the owners knew it was going <b>on.</b> <b>But</b> more important, the players knew that the owners knew—and they knew the owners were doing nothing about it for fear of a scandal that might damage organized baseball. Under such conditions it quite obviously did not pay to be honest.|$|E

5|$|Director Hifumi Kono was not {{interested}} in developing a sequel to the original Clock Tower at first, but was swayed after seeing the technical possibilities of the next generation consoles. Kono had difficulty in choosing the platform to develop <b>on,</b> <b>but</b> eventually settled for the new PlayStation despite its uncertain future. Clock Tower {{was one of the first}} games developed by Human Entertainment to utilize a 3D graphics engine. The team felt challenged to create high-quality graphics after being impressed by the visuals of Resident Evil (1996), which was announced during development.|$|E
5|$|First {{the hopeful}} note: There are faint signs the {{tinkering}} with Temperatures format {{could make the}} series funny later <b>on,</b> <b>but</b> only if the writing improves. The show now leaves most of the mugging to Lynde and no longer insists that each regular is wacky. It's all feeble stuff but the cast is vastly improved and the new approach portends to better things ahead.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the third}} match, The Undertaker defended the World Heavyweight Championship against CM Punk, Rey Mysterio and Batista in a Fatal 4-way match.

5|$|In East Africa, {{the blue}} {{wildebeest}} {{is the most}} abundant big game species; some populations perform an annual migration to new grazing grounds, but the black wildebeest is merely nomadic. Breeding in both takes place over {{a short period of}} time at the end of the rainy season and the calves are soon active and are able to move with the herd, a fact necessary for their survival. Nevertheless, some fall prey to large carnivores, especially the spotted hyena. Wildebeest often graze in mixed herds with zebra which gives heightened awareness of potential predators. They are also alert to the warning signals emitted by other animals such as baboons. Wildebeest are a tourist attraction but compete with domesticated livestock for pasture and are sometimes blamed by farmers for transferring diseases and parasites to their cattle. Some illegal hunting goes <b>on</b> <b>but</b> the population trend is fairly stable and some populations are in national parks or on private land. The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists both as least-concern species.|$|E
5|$|In New York City, Stephen Strange, an {{acclaimed}} but arrogant neurosurgeon, badly injures {{his hands}} in a car accident, leaving him unable to operate. Fellow surgeon and former lover Christine Palmer tries to help him move <b>on,</b> <b>but</b> Strange vainly pursues experimental surgeries to heal his hands. Strange eventually learns of Jonathan Pangborn, a paraplegic who mysteriously regained full use of his legs. Pangborn directs Strange to Kamar-Taj, where he is taken in by Mordo, a sorcerer under the Ancient One. The Ancient One demonstrates her power to Strange, revealing the astral plane and other dimensions such as the Mirror Dimension. She eventually agrees to train Strange, despite his arrogance, which reminds her of Kaecilius.|$|E
5|$|In late February, ground sensors {{detected}} the 66th Regiment, 304th NVA Division preparing {{to mount an}} attack on the positions of the 37th ARVN Ranger Battalion on the eastern perimeter. On the night of 28 February the Combat Base unleashed artillery and airstrikes on possible North Vietnamese staging areas and routes of advance. At 21:30, the attack came <b>on,</b> <b>but</b> it was stifled by the small arms of the Rangers, who were supported by thousands of artillery rounds and air strikes. Two further attacks later in the morning were halted before the North Vietnamese finally withdrew. NVA, however, was not through with the ARVN troops. Five more attacks against their sector were launched during the month of March.|$|E
50|$|After that, Sami Zayn faced Shinsuke Nakamura. During the match, Nakamura {{applied a}} Cross Armbreaker <b>on</b> Zayn <b>but</b> Zayn fought {{out of the}} hold. Zayn applied a Koji Clutch <b>on</b> Nakamura <b>but</b> Nakamura countered the move into a roll-up for a near-fall. Nakamura {{attempted}} a Kinshasa <b>on</b> Zayn <b>but</b> Zayn avoided the move and performed a Blue Thunder Bomb on Nakamura for a near-fall. In the end, Zayn attempted an Exploder Suplex into the turnbuckles <b>on</b> Nakamura <b>but</b> Nakamura countered the move and performed a Kinshasa off the middle rope, followed by a second Kinshasa to win the match.|$|R

As at Reims, Brabham successfully slipstreamed the race leaders early <b>on,</b> <b>but</b> an oil leakage stopped the car after 8 laps. Neither Surtees nor Stewart finished the race and Brabham clinched his third world championship.|$|E
5|$|Leterrier and Roth were {{originally}} contracted to return. Leterrier also stated Norton was not signed <b>on,</b> <b>but</b> in October 2008, Hurd stated that Norton was contracted to reprise the role. The film had outgrossed its predecessor and Universal indicated {{interest in a}} sequel, though Leterrier believed a sequel would not be made because of the film's box office return. Feige said the film met Marvel's expectations and that Hulk would return, but after the crossover. Hurd was not concerned that a sequel may not be produced until at least 2012, citing the positive reception to the film and having produced the Terminator series, {{the second and third}} film of which had a 12-year gap. Tim Roth confirmed that Marvel had signed him for three more films. Leterrier, after having previously said {{he did not want to}} direct a sequel, said in late 2009 he had changed his mind and was now amenable.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Grace (Debra Messing) copes {{with her}} failed {{marriage}} to Leo (Harry Connick, Jr.). She tries to move <b>on,</b> <b>but</b> mementos {{of the past}} do not let her. Her best friend Will (Eric McCormack) tries to help her but to no avail. While at dinner with his boyfriend Vince (Bobby Cannavale), and Vince's superior officer, Grace calls him, displeasing Vince. Believing that Grace might be suicidal, Will leaves to attend to her. Vince shows up at Will and Grace's apartment to confront her, telling her that she is affecting his relationship with Will because she is too needy. This prompts Grace and Vince to bicker, with the two asking Will to choose between them. He cannot choose between them as Grace is his long-time friend, but he also cares for Vince. The episode concludes with him telling Vince {{that he wants to}} work things out, but before they can discuss it, Vince sees Grace's wedding album, resulting in him being more focused on the album than the relationship.|$|E

5|$|Only a {{few days}} after the death of Theodore II (the sources {{disagree}} on the exact date, although 25 August is the widely accepted date), a memorial service was held at the Monastery of Sosandra in Magnesia, founded by John III Vatatzes (r. 1221–1254) and serving as his and Theodore's burial place. The entire court attended, while the army was encamped on the plain below the monastery. As soon as George Mouzalon, his brothers and his retinue arrived, the service began. Outside the church, however, soldiers had assembled, many of them Latin mercenaries, and they began to clamour and demand to see the young emperor. John IV went outside and raised his hand to quiet them; the soldiers, however, allegedly mistook this as a signal. Joined by a large mob, they stormed the church aiming to kill the Mouzalon brothers. They were warned of what was going <b>on,</b> <b>but</b> George only sent his secretary Theophylact to investigate. He was mistaken for Mouzalon and killed by the crowd. The mob, however, realized its error (the secretary was wearing black shoes, while the protovestiarios wore green ones) and entered the church, the soldiers with swords in hand.|$|E
5|$|Other policemen {{arrived in}} Houndsditch, {{and began to}} attend to the wounded. Tucker's body was put into a taxi and he was taken to the London Hospital (now the Royal London Hospital) in Whitechapel Road.

He was half-conscious on arrival, but recovered {{enough to be able to}} have a conversation with his pregnant wife and answer questions about the events. At 6:45pm on 17 December his condition worsened, and he died at 7:30. The killings of Tucker, Bentley and Choate remain one of the largest multiple murders of police officers carried out in Britain in peacetime.|$|E
5|$|Sol quickly {{falls for}} Naz when they meet, but his anger threatens their relationship. Sol {{has never met}} a girl like Naz before, and Cole said Naz {{probably}} has not met boys like Sol before either. Hussen said {{that there is something}} about Sol that attracts Naz. She is stronger than he is so Naz likes to take him in and teach him things. Cole explained that Sol is attracted to Naz because she is different from other girls and they are complete opposites. and Sol depends on him. Looking after Sol takes a toll on Asher, however. One of Cole's first scenes to film was a kiss between Sol and Naz. Cole found it tough and awkward as the actors had only just met, and would have preferred it to be filmed later <b>on,</b> <b>but</b> said that the scene was awkward anyway so {{he did not have to}} act much for it. Sol has also been described as shy, caring, sweet, thoughtful, soft, easily hurt and reserved.|$|E
50|$|In {{the sixth}} match, The Shield (Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns) defended the Tag Team Championship against Daniel Bryan and Randy Orton.
