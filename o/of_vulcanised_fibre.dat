40|$|Konstige tanden’ – False teeth made of {{bone and}} ivory from Dutch collectionsDental {{healthcare}} {{in the past}} was not as advanced as nowadays. Most people who suffered from caries (or worse) had no other option than to have the ‘bad’ tooth extracted. A set of false teeth was only an option the rich could afford. Finding a suitable material for these prostheses was a struggle for the manufacturers. For a long period ivory, and sometimes bone, was the only option. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine more than one hundred false teeth made of bone and ivory from archaeological and museum collections, with the purpose to identify the used materials and to investigate the development of these dentures. Archaeological examples were the oldest false teeth recovered, the oldest dating to the 17 th century. A persistent misinterpretation is the use of walrus ivory for the manufacture of false teeth in the time under investigation. Both walrus and hippopotamus ivory have been misidentified for a long time mainly because both species have been named ‘seahorse’. Of all the examined dentures 71 % was made of hippopotamus ivory, 18 % of walrus ivory, 8 % of elephant ivory and only 3 % of bone. Before the discovery <b>of</b> <b>vulcanised</b> rubber in the mid- 19 th century hippopotamus ivory was the best material to manufacture false teeth, because of the hard enamel layer which retained its white colour much longer than other materials. Archaeological finds show that hippopotamus ivory was imported for only one purpose: the manufacture of false teeth. These false teeth were probably made more often by ivory workers rather than by ‘tooth masters’. Although ivory false teeth were a good solution for esthetical reasons and to regain speech and chewing abilities, the lack of hygiene must have caused a lot of pain and trouble to their rich wearers...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the use of rheological equations of state to describe the behaviour <b>of</b> <b>vulcanised</b> elastomers and, in particular, vulcanised elastomers loaded with carbon black. The properties of these materials are dependent upon the specific combination of elastomer and carbon black, and the effect of carbon black loading is studied by means of experiments on a butadiene-acrylonitrile base polymer KRYNAC 806, unfilled and loaded with 50 phr SRF N 774 carbon black. The first part of this work concerns small ampIitude oscillatory shear experiments carried out on a Weissenberg rheogoniometer over a range of amplitudes, frequencies, and temperatures. Both materials are found to remain within the linear viscoelastic region for temperatures greater than about - 10 °c, to obey the time-temperature superposition principle, and to have identical shift factors. Dynamic moduli over a reduced frequency range of about ten decades of log frequency are characterised by the Huet model. The second part concerns finite deformation experiments consisting of prestraining samples in simple tension and applying small axial oscillations when stress relaxation is almost complete. Dependencies of the incremental dynamic moduli measured in this way are investigated with regard to frequency and extension ratio. Moduli measurements indicate that the time dependence of the materials is unaffected by deformation, although relaxation spectrum functions for the filled sample are strain dependent. A criterion is established for testing whether results can be modelled by a certain class of non-linear viscoelastic constitutive equations. A constitutive equation is proposed which represents the strain dependence of moduli for both the filled and unfilled materials. Other published data are shown not to conform to the above criterion. It is also shown that despite this fact, in some cases at least, the proposed constitutive equation provides a better represent at ion of published data than other constitutive equations which have hitherto been applied...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The use of cellular polyurethanes either as microporous foams in shoe upper materials (poromerics) or in closed cell form as soling materials has increased rapidly {{during the last few}} years in the footwear industry. Compared with vulcanised rubbers, these materials have high strength over an extended temperature range, high set and good resistance to cut growth. The research now presented. has been concerned with determining the reasons for these mechanical properties of polyurethane as compared with compounded conventional vulcanised rubbers. The supplementary contribution to the thesis presents a review of earlier work on the strength and reinforcement of crystalline, amorphous and filled vulcanised rubbers and includes a short section on the effect of crosslinking on ultimate failure properties of natural rubber. This study has been extended by the author into the effect of chain branching in polyurethane elastomers on the failure properties. The viscoelastic properties of natural and artificial leathers are also discussed in order to demonstrate similarities between the different materials and show how a cellular polyurethane sheet has hysteresial properties similar to those of a natural material of fibrous structure. It is shown that a cubical lattice model can be applied to explain the differences between such mechanical properties as modulus, tensile and tear strength of a cellular polyurethane and the corresponding solid material of the same polymer. This model, which has previously been applied to the mechanical properties of a natural rubber latex foam, indicates that the strength of cellular polyurethanes is due to the very high strength of the solid material. An extensive investigation into the effect of time and temperature on the tensile properties of cellular and solid polyurethanes is presented in order to show that polyurethanes of the type used in poromerics have a very broad relaxation spectrum extending over 18 decades of time. Because of this response to deformation, the failure properties remain fairly constant over the temperature range from 21 – 160 °c. Above 160 °c, the tensile properties fall quite markedly. Stress softening in these polyurethanes is very high and can only be reversed by heating to temperatures above 160 °c. The cut growth and fatigue properties of cellular and solid polyurethanes are considered. Following a brief review of the investigation on cut growth and fatigue <b>of</b> <b>vulcanised</b> rubbers involving the use of tearing energy theory, it is shown that cut growth and hysteresis properties <b>of</b> <b>vulcanised.</b> rubbers can be correlated. The lower limit of tearing energy (To) below which no cut growth takes place in the absence of chemical effects is found to be higher for polyurethanes than for vulcanised rubbers. Fatigue failure of cellular polyurethanes is found to be due to cut growth from the largest pore in the sample. These data are also compared with measurements on other two phase elastomer systems such as styrene butadiene copolymer vulcanisates with high styrene content and polystyrene-polybutadiene thermoplastic rubbers. From an extensive review of the literature on the structure of polyurethane elastomers, it is deduced that polyurethanes of the type used in poromerics consist of a segmented structure of long polyester chains connected to very minute (25 Å) hard urethane segments. The cohesion of the hard segments is primarily due to hydrogen bonding and other physical forces. It is concluded that the high strength, good cut growth resistance and broad relaxation spectrum of polyurethanes are due to the reinforcement given by the hard urethane segments which act as well dispersed minute filler particles in the polyester rubber matrix. The hydrogen bonding between the hard segments dissociates at approximately 170 °c so giving a degree of thermoplasticity which produces a very high permanent set. An appendix discusses some of the practical applications in the footwear industry of the work presented, such as forming of poromerics, tearing from stitch-holes and flex cracking of soling...|$|R

40|$|Polymers and polymer-based {{composite}} materials with electrically-conductive properties are materials with various potential uses. Novel materials are becoming available in each field and new products are continuously being produced. Amid these new materials, conductive elastomers are presently being employed as antistatic {{materials in the}} carpets, antistatic coatings, sensors and electromagnetic screening. One promising method for making this type of material is to introduce carbon black or metal fillers, or more currently conducting polymer powders into natural or synthetic rubbers. Several polyaniline-rubber blends, mostly with poor electrical conductivity, {{have been reported in}} the literature. An important aim of this work was to improve the compatibility, thermal stability, electrical and mechanical properties of this kind of blend, produced by different mixing techniques for instance solution and thermo-mechanical with further methodical mixing processes and greater improved mixing circumstances. Polyepichlorohydrin, polychloroprene rubber, chlorosulfonated polyethylene rubber and polyaniline dodecylbenzenesulfonate (PAni-DBSA) were selected for study as blends in this project, since the solubility parameters of polyepichlorohydrin rubber, polychloroprene, chlorosulfonated polethylene and polyaniline dodecylbenzenesulfonate were calculated to be well-matched, and also because the polyepichlorohydrin rubber (PECH), polychloroprene rubber (PCR) and chlorosulfonated polyethylene (CSPE) were thermally stable and easily obtainable. No previous literature was discovered in relation to the electrical properties of the polyepichlorohydrin, polychloroprene or chlorosulfonated polyethylene blends with polyaniline dodecylbenzenesulfonate (PAni-DBSA). Hence, the PECH, PCR and CSPE rubbers were also chosen in this work with the purpose of studying them. Non-vulcanised PECH/P Ani-DBSA, non- vulcanised PCRlPAni-DBSA and non-vulcanised CSPEIPAni-DBSA blends with appropriate electrical conductivities were produced by solution mixing for the first time in this project. Blends of the PECH, PCR and CSPE rubbers and polyaniline doped with dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid, consisting of various proportions of P Ani- DBSA, were cast from solution onto polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) substrates with the aim of making electrically conductive films. Electrical conductivities of the cast films of non-vulcanised blends were calculated. Decomposition steps of electrical conductive polymer blends were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The thermal stabilities of the PECHlPAni-DBSA, PCRJPAni-DBSA and CSPEIP Ani-DBSA blends were affected by the proportion of polyaniline dodecylbenzenesulfonate to the rubbers. The influence of composition on the glass transitions in the blends was defined by the use of thermomechanical analysis (TMA).

40|$|Compared to carbon black, {{the use of}} silica as {{reinforcing}} filler for rubber results in lower hysteretic losses, for tyre applications leading to lower rolling resistance and consequently fuel savings. The compatibility of hydrophilic silica with a hydrophobic rubber polymer matrix is generally poor. Adding bi-functional coupling agents to the compounds, commonly bis(triethoxysilylpropyl) tetrasulphide (TESPT), enhances filler-matrix compatibility. The degree of hydrophobation of silica during rubber mixing then depends on many mutually interacting factors. Irreproducible conditions during mixing and vulcanisation are major causes of irreproducibility of silica-reinforced rubber compounds. Depending on the chemical composition of the coupling agent, the ultimate temperature obtained during the mixing process {{turns out to be}} the main factor governing the reactions of the coupling agent: the formation of a proper bond between the silica and the coupling agent, while avoiding a premature reaction with the rubber polymers, leading to premature scorch during mixing. Further, the mechanistic aspects of the reaction of various coupling agents, variants on TESPT, are covered, with silica as well as with the rubber. Of great importance are: the carbon and sulphur chain-lengths within the coupling agents, whether corrections are applied in the compound with elemental sulphur relative to the sulphur contained in the reference TESPT, and the moments the correcting amounts of sulphur are added to the compounds: during the first mixing stage, or together with the curing ingredients later-on in the process. The tensile properties <b>of</b> the <b>vulcanised</b> compounds are most prominently influenced. This is indicative of the dual role of sulphur: on the one hand as direct curative, on the other hand as part of the coupling agent becoming attached to the rubber polymers...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} component that secures durability of composite insulators for high voltage applications {{is the quality}} of internal interfaces. Weak interfaces, in form of a reduced bonding or a loss of the adhesion between the insulation components, can be devastating for the long-term functionality of an insulator. A failure can take place years after the first signs of the appearance of ageing or weakening of the interfaces. The failure process may be accelerated by moisture ingress or even be initiated by partial discharge activity at the interfaces. The ambitions of manufacturers have therefore been directed towards designing interfaces with good and durable long-term properties that secure very low rate of ageing. However, there is insufficient knowledge about the ageing mechanisms of interfaces in composite insulators and knowledge on how the interfaces affect their durability in a long-term perspective. Moreover {{there is a lack of}} standardized ageing tests for evaluating quality of interfaces in composite insulation systems. In this work the aim has been to better understand the effects of ageing on properties and integrity of composite insulation systems containing interfacial defects. This was approached by investigating model interface objects with added artificial defects. Two different types of the objects were studied. In the first study, the inclined plane arrangement was used in a salt fog chamber to test samples produced in a manner that simulated eventual repairs performed on insulator housings of large hollow-core insulators. The interfaces studied were models of material joints obtained by two different techniques. The first type of joint was obtained by means <b>of</b> high temperature <b>vulcanised</b> silicone rubber, which, after the joint formation, was cured. The second type of joint was obtained by means <b>of</b> room temperature <b>vulcanised</b> silicone glue. To evaluate results of the tests, the changes of the tensile strength were monitored. It was found that the best long-term performance was achieved when the repair was carried out with the high temperature vulcanised rubber. The second study concentrated on evaluation of defects exhibiting insufficient adhesion at the interface between silicone rubber and epoxy resin substrate when exposed to partial discharges under dry and wet conditions. The investigations revealed that the epoxy substrate degraded since residues of epoxy resin decomposition were detected. In addition, surface cracking appeared on the silicone rubber facing the interface. This indicated formation of a silica layer on the exposed surface. Tendencies for defect growth, caused by a loss of adhesion outside of the defect area, were also observed, but this trend was not clear enough for drawing final conclusions about the effect...|$|R
