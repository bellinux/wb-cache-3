500|$|To {{minimize}} her tax liability, Heyer {{formed a}} {{limited liability company}} called Heron Enterprises around 1950. Royalties from new titles would {{be paid to the}} company, which would then furnish Heyer's salary and pay directors' fees to her family. She would continue to receive royalties from her previous titles, and foreign royalties – except for those from the United States – would go to her mother. Within several years, however, a tax inspector found that Heyer was withdrawing too much money from the company. The inspector considered the extra funds as undisclosed dividends, meaning that she owed an additional £3,000 in taxes. To pay the tax bill, Heyer wrote two articles, [...] "Books about the Brontës" [...] and [...] "How to be a Literary Writer", that were published in the magazine Punch. She once wrote to a friend, [...] "I'm getting so tired of writing books {{for the benefit of the}} Treasury and I can't tell you how utterly I resent the squandering <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>money</b> on such fatuous things as Education and Making Life Easy and Luxurious for So-Called Workers." ...|$|E
2500|$|On December 16, 2013, Newsted {{expanded}} upon previous statements {{regarding his}} departure from Metallica and cited that his project with Echobrain was being discouraged by James Hetfield because Metallica's management at Q Prime {{wanted to go}} ahead with promoting Echobrain but was forced to drop it by Hetfield's demands with the quote [...] "other arrangements can be made". Jason was sure that Echobrain would not affect Metallica as it was the pedigree that it already needed. Newsted continues, “And so they had told me, pretty convincingly, ‘This is a great record, we’ve been playing it around the office, that’s all I’ve been hearing, it’s fantastic, this kid has a great voice. Let’s do something with this.’ That’s what they told me, and then James Hetfield heard about it and was not happy. He was, I think, pretty much out to put the kibosh on the whole thing because it would somehow affect Metallica in his eyes, because now the managers were interested in something I was doing {{that had nothing to do}} with him. ”The bassist sums up the situation as follows: “I have no idea what [...] was thinking, other than just protecting what he valued, just like he does; that's his thing. He protects what he loves, squeezes it too hard, like he said himself. Squeeze it too hard, protecting it too much. That's where I was coming from. The people that I had counted on for 15 years to help me with my career, help Metallica, take care <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>money,</b> do all of those things, told me, 'Your new project is fantastic, we'd like to help you with it.' James heard about it, the manager calls me back a couple of days later – 'Sorry we're not going to be able to help you with that Echobrain thing.'” ...|$|E

60|$|At last a {{policeman}} came along, and arrested me for disturbing the peace by yelling at people on shore for help. The judge fined me, but I {{had the advantage}} <b>of</b> him. <b>My</b> <b>money</b> was with <b>my</b> pantaloons, and my pantaloons were with the Indians.|$|R
6000|$|... "It has {{everything}} to do, since I was there attending to my own business. The officer's quarterly bill should have been paid last Thursday, and, knowing he was on duty at the place, I went there in the hope <b>of</b> getting <b>my</b> <b>money.</b> Does that seem reasonable?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite right," [...] said Miss Todd; [...] "quite {{right if}} you like him. Now for me, I'm so fond <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own <b>money</b> and <b>my</b> own independence, that I've never had a fancy that way,--not since I was a girl." ...|$|R

60|$|I {{know not}} any {{advantage}} that can accrue {{by such a}} bill, except the preventing of perjury in jurymen, and false dealing in tenants; which is a remedy like that <b>of</b> giving <b>my</b> <b>money</b> to an highwayman, before he attempts to take it by force; and so I shall be sure to prevent the sin of robbery.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have made}} a good many daring moves since my brother gave me his power of attorney, and I have sunk more <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own <b>money</b> than <b>my</b> partners, who have backed me pluckily, care about. Still, I can't see how I'm going to meet your estimate, nohow." ...|$|R

60|$|Sir Robert laughed heartily at me, {{but gave}} over {{offering}} any more arguments, only {{told me he}} had pointed me out for some of the best merchants in London, but since I forbade him he would give me no disturbance of that kind.
