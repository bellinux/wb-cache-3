5|$|A {{central point}} of debate on GWA studies {{has been that}} most of the SNP {{variations}} found by GWA studies are associated with only a small increased risk of the disease, and have only a small predictive value. The median odds ratio is 1.33 per risk-SNP, with only a few showing <b>odds</b> <b>ratios</b> above 3.0. These magnitudes are considered small because they do not explain much of the heritable variation. This heritable variation is known from heritability studies based on monozygotic twins. For example, it is known that 80-90% of variance in height can be explained by hereditary differences, but GWA studies only account for a minority of this variance.|$|E
5|$|Since {{these first}} {{landmark}} GWA studies, {{there have been}} two general trends. One has been towards larger and larger sample sizes. At the end of 2011, the largest sample sizes were in the range of 200,000 individuals. The reason is the drive towards reliably detecting risk-SNPs that have smaller <b>odds</b> <b>ratios</b> and lower allele frequency. Another trend has been towards the use of more narrowly defined phenotypes, such as blood lipids, proinsulin or similar biomarkers. These are called intermediate phenotypes, and their analyses may be of value to functional research into biomarkers. A variation of GWAS uses participants that are first-degree relatives of people with a disease. This type of study has been named genome-wide association study by proxy (GWAX).|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{approach}} of GWA studies is the case-control setup, which compares two {{large groups of}} individuals, one healthy control group and one case group affected by a disease. All individuals in each group are genotyped {{for the majority of}} common known SNPs. The exact number of SNPs depends on the genotyping technology, but are typically one million or more. For each of these SNPs it is then investigated if the allele frequency is significantly altered between the case and the control group. In such setups, the fundamental unit for reporting effect sizes is the odds ratio. The odds ratio is the ratio of two odds, which in the context of GWA studies are the odds of disease for individuals having a specific allele and the odds of disease for individuals who do not have that same allele. When the allele frequency in the case group is much higher than in the control group, the odds ratio is higher than 1, and vice versa for lower allele frequency. Additionally, a P-value for the significance of the odds ratio is typically calculated using a simple chi-squared test. Finding <b>odds</b> <b>ratios</b> that are significantly different from 1 is the objective of the GWA study because this shows that a SNP is associated with disease.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>odds</b> <b>ratio</b> [...] {{for this}} {{distribution}} {{does not depend}} on the value of f. This shows that the <b>odds</b> <b>ratio</b> (and consequently the log <b>odds</b> <b>ratio)</b> is invariant to non-random sampling based on one of the variables being studied. Note however that the standard error of the log <b>odds</b> <b>ratio</b> does depend on the value of f.|$|R
25|$|The (latter mentioned) {{effect of}} {{overestimation}} can {{be compensated for}} by converting risks to odds, and relative risks to <b>odds</b> <b>ratios.</b> However, this does not compensate for (former mentioned) effect of any difference between pre-test probability of an individual and the prevalence in the reference group.|$|E
25|$|Dangerous and {{potentially}} fatal skin reactions, including Stevens–Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, caused by carbamazepine therapy are significantly {{more common in}} people with a particular human leukocyte antigen allele, HLA-B*1502. <b>Odds</b> <b>ratios</b> {{for the development of}} Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis in people who carry the allele can be in the double, triple or even quadruple digits, depending on the population studied. HLA-B*1502 occurs almost exclusively in people with ancestry across broad areas of Asia, but has a very low or absent frequency in European, Japanese, Korean and African populations. However, the HLA-A*31:01 allele {{has been shown to be}} a strong predictor of both mild and severe adverse reactions to carbamazepine among Japanese and Europeans.|$|E
500|$|After <b>odds</b> <b>ratios</b> and P-values {{have been}} {{calculated}} for all SNPs, a common {{approach is to}} create a Manhattan plot. In the context of GWA studies, this plot shows the negative logarithm of the P-value as a function of genomic location. Thus the SNPs with the most significant association stand out on the plot, usually as stacks of points because of haploblock structure. Importantly, the P-value threshold for significance is corrected for multiple testing issues. The exact threshold varies by study, but the conventional threshold is [...] to be significant in the face of hundreds of thousands to millions of tested SNPs. GWA studies typically perform the first analysis in a discovery cohort, followed by validation of the most significant SNPs in an independent validation cohort.|$|E
5000|$|One {{approach}} to inference uses large sample approximations to the sampling {{distribution of the}} log <b>odds</b> <b>ratio</b> (the natural logarithm of the <b>odds</b> <b>ratio).</b> If we use the joint probability notation defined above, the population log <b>odds</b> <b>ratio</b> is ...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>odds</b> <b>ratio</b> is a {{function}} of the cell probabilities, and conversely, the cell probabilities can be recovered given knowledge of the <b>odds</b> <b>ratio</b> and the marginal probabilities [...] and [...] If the <b>odds</b> <b>ratio</b> R differs from 1, then ...|$|R
50|$|In this case, the <b>odds</b> <b>ratio</b> equals one, and {{conversely}} the <b>odds</b> <b>ratio</b> {{can only}} equal one if the joint probabilities can be factored in this way. Thus the <b>odds</b> <b>ratio</b> equals one if {{and only if}} X and Y are independent.|$|R
2500|$|As {{the odds}} ratio {{approached}} 1, approaches 0; rendering case control studies all but useless for low <b>odds</b> <b>ratios.</b> For instance, for an odds ratio of 1.5 and cases = controls, the table shown above {{would look like}} this: ...|$|E
5000|$|To compare {{effect sizes}} of the {{interactions}} between the variables, <b>odds</b> <b>ratios</b> are used. <b>Odds</b> <b>ratios</b> are preferred over chi-square statistics for two main reasons: ...|$|E

50|$|For {{individuals}} homozygous in the 677T variant, {{there is}} a mildly elevated risk of thromboembolism (<b>odds</b> <b>ratio</b> 1.2), and stroke (<b>odds</b> <b>ratio</b> 1.26). There is also an elevated risk of neural tube defects among children of individuals with the C677T polymorphism (<b>odds</b> <b>ratio</b> 1.38).|$|R
50|$|In fact, the <b>odds</b> <b>ratio</b> {{has much}} wider use in statistics, since {{logistic}} regression, {{often associated with}} clinical trials, works with the log of the <b>odds</b> <b>ratio,</b> not relative risk. Because the log of the <b>odds</b> <b>ratio</b> is estimated as a linear function of the explanatory variables, the estimated <b>odds</b> <b>ratio</b> for 70-year-olds and 60-year-olds associated with type of treatment {{would be the same}} in a logistic regression models where the outcome is associated with drug and age, although the relative risk might be significantly different. In cases like this, statistical models of the <b>odds</b> <b>ratio</b> often reflect the underlying mechanisms more effectively.|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveSignificant technologic {{advances}} have improved outcomes in neonatal cardiac surgery {{over the past}} 3 decades. However, outcomes might be different in developing countries with resource limitations. We sought to identify the determinants of early outcome after neonatal cardiac surgery in a tertiary referral center in South India. MethodsHospital records of 330 consecutive neonates who underwent surgical intervention between January 1999 and April 2006 were reviewed, and perioperative variables were recorded. Main outcome measures were 30 -day mortality, postoperative bloodstream infection, and hospital stay of longer than 10 days. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed. ResultsOverall mortality was 8. 8 %. Mortality significantly decreased from 21. 4 % before 2002 to 4. 3 % after 2002 (3. 2 % for corrective operations, P <. 0001). The prevalence of postoperative bloodstream infection remained the same, whereas surgical site infection and hospital stay significantly increased after 2002. Predictors of outcomes on multivariate analysis were as follows: (1) mortality—operation before 2002 (<b>odds</b> <b>ratio,</b> 5. 5), age less than 7 days (<b>odds</b> <b>ratio,</b> 3. 8), preoperative antibiotic use (<b>odds</b> <b>ratio,</b> 5. 6), and postoperative exchange transfusion (<b>odds</b> <b>ratio,</b> 14. 9); (2) postoperative bloodstream infection (21. 2 %) —use of cardiopulmonary bypass (<b>odds</b> <b>ratio,</b> 2. 0), reintubation (<b>odds</b> <b>ratio,</b> 7. 7), and surgical site infection (<b>odds</b> <b>ratio,</b> 4. 1); and (3) hospital stay of longer than 10 days (61. 2 %) —use of cardiopulmonary bypass (<b>odds</b> <b>ratio,</b> 2. 8), delayed sternal closure (<b>odds</b> <b>ratio,</b> 3. 6), reintubation (<b>odds</b> <b>ratio,</b> 12. 1), surgical site infection (<b>odds</b> <b>ratio,</b> 13. 8), and postoperative antibiotic use (<b>odds</b> <b>ratio,</b> 4. 4). ConclusionsWith increasing experience, neonatal cardiac surgery can be performed with excellent outcomes in developing countries with resource limitations. Infectious complications contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality, and improvements in infection-control practices should be emphasized to improve outcomes further...|$|R

40|$|Post-poliomyelitis {{syndrome}} (PPS) is {{a clinical}} syndrome of new weakness, fatigue, and pain in {{individuals who have}} previously recovered from acute paralytic poliomyelitis. The primary objective {{of this study was}} to identify factors which predict subsequent PPS. Among patients with prior polio, cases were those with new weakness and fatigue, and controls were those without these complaints. A chart review of 353 patients evaluated at the Montreal Neurological Institute post-polio clinic identified 127 cases and 39 controls. In univariate analyses, significant risk factors for PPS were a greater current age (<b>odds</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1. 8 per decade, 95 % confidence interval 1. 3 to 2. 6), a longer time since acute polio (<b>odds</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1. 6 per decade, 95 % confidence interval 1. 1 to 2. 3), more weakness at acute polio (<b>odds</b> <b>ratio</b> 1. 5, 95 % confidence interval 1. 1 to 2. 0), a recent weight gain (<b>odds</b> <b>ratio</b> 3. 8, 95 % confidence interval 1. 6 to 9. 4), muscle pain with exercise (<b>odds</b> <b>ratio</b> 3. 8, 95 % confidence interval 1. 5 to 9. 5), muscle pain (<b>odds</b> <b>ratio</b> 2. 6, 95 % confidence interval 1. 3 to 5. 5), and joint pain (<b>odds</b> <b>ratio</b> 2. 3, 95 % confidence interval 1. 1 to 5. 3).

40|$|AbstractObjective: We {{sought to}} assess the optimal {{strategy}} for avoiding neurologic injury after aortic operations requiring hypothermic circulatory arrest. Methods: All 717 patients who survived ascending aorta–aortic arch operations through a median sternotomy since 1986 were examined for factors influencing stroke. Temporary neurologic dysfunction was assessed in all patients who survived the operation without stroke since 1993. Multivariate analyses were carried out to determine independent risk factors for neurologic injury. Results: Independent risk factors for stroke were as follows: age greater than 60 years (P <. 001; <b>odds</b> <b>ratio,</b> 4. 5); emergency operation (P =. 02; <b>odds</b> <b>ratio,</b> 2. 2); new preoperative neurologic symptoms (P =. 05; <b>odds</b> <b>ratio,</b> 2. 9); presence of clot or atheroma (P <. 001; <b>odds</b> <b>ratio,</b> 4. 4); mitral valve replacement or other concomitant procedures (P =. 055; <b>odds</b> <b>ratio,</b> = 3. 7); and total cerebral protection time, defined as the sum of hypothermic circulatory arrest and any retrograde or antegrade cerebral perfusion (P =. 001; <b>odds</b> <b>ratio,</b> 1. 02 /min). In 453 patients surviving operations without stroke after 1993, independent risk factors for temporary neurologic dysfunction included age (P <. 001; <b>odds</b> <b>ratio,</b> 1. 06 /y), dissection (P =. 001; <b>odds</b> <b>ratio,</b> 2. 2), need for coronary artery bypass grafting (P =. 006; <b>odds</b> <b>ratio,</b> 2. 1) or other procedures (P =. 023; <b>odds</b> <b>ratio,</b> 3. 4), and total cerebral protection time (P <. 001; <b>odds</b> <b>ratio,</b> 1. 02 /min).

40|$|BackgroundLow {{cardiac output}} {{syndrome}} {{is defined as}} the need for a postoperative intra-aortic balloon pump or inotropic support for longer than 30 minutes in the intensive care unit. Mitral valve surgery is increasingly being performed in high-risk patients who might require mechanical circulatory support for low cardiac output syndrome. Therefore the aim {{of this study was to}} identify the preoperative predictors of low cardiac output syndrome after mitral valve surgery. MethodsWe conducted a retrospective review of data prospectively entered into an institutional database. Between 1990 and February 2008, 3039 patients underwent isolated mitral valve surgery with or without coronary bypass surgery. The independent predictors of low cardiac output syndrome and operative mortality were determined by means of stepwise logistic regression analysis. ResultsThe overall prevalence of low cardiac output syndrome was 7 %. The independent predictors of low cardiac output syndrome were urgency of the operation (<b>odds</b> <b>ratio,</b> 2. 9), earlier year of operation (<b>odds</b> <b>ratio,</b> 2. 4), left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 40 % (<b>odds</b> <b>ratio,</b> 2. 1), New York Heart Association class IV (<b>odds</b> <b>ratio,</b> 2), body surface area of 1. 7 m 2 or less (<b>odds</b> <b>ratio,</b> 1. 6), ischemic mitral valve pathology (<b>odds</b> <b>ratio,</b> 1. 6), and cardiopulmonary bypass time (<b>odds</b> <b>ratio,</b> 1. 02). The operative mortality was higher in patients with low cardiac output syndrome (30 % vs 1. 3 %, P <. 001). Overall operative mortality was 3. 4 %. The independent predictors of mortality were urgency of the operation (<b>odds</b> <b>ratio,</b> 7. 1), renal failure (<b>odds</b> <b>ratio,</b> 4. 3), nonuse of polytetrafluoroethylene sutures (Gore-Tex; W.
