He likes using magic to surprise others, such as making flowers and small birds appear <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere.</b> His sacrifice for magic is that he ages quickly. For example, when Misaki was saved by him, she was surprised he had aged a few years in one day.|$|E

When he stops and starts singing, the camera comes into focus and the other band members come out from behind him and start lip-synching his vocals. A group of people (In which {{one of them is}} YouTube star, Wendy McColm) pull up in cars and they also lip-synch the song, in addition to performing other activities throughout the video. The video's effects allow people to seemingly appear <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere</b> throughout the video.|$|E

5|$|As the Enterprise arrives, {{the crew}} members explore the offerings of Farpoint Station and {{establish}} relations with their Bandi host, Groppler Zorn (Michael Bell). The crew becomes suspicious when items they desire seem to appear <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere</b> moments later, and are unable to identify the power source that feeds the station. Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis), an empath, senses a being with powerful yet despairing emotions nearby, and the crew discover a strange labyrinth beneath the station, but Zorn does not offer an explanation. As the Enterprise crew continues its explorations, a large unknown alien craft enters orbit and begins to fire upon an older Bandi settlement near Farpoint Station, and abducts Zorn. Before Picard orders the ship's phasers to be fired at the craft, Q appears {{to remind him of}} humanity's trial and prompts Picard to send an away team to the alien craft. The away team discovers the craft has passages similar to those under Farpoint and they are able to free Zorn. Their actions cause the alien craft to transform into a jellyfish-like space creature, and Picard is able to deduce the mystery of Farpoint Station. He confirms with the apologetic Zorn that the Bandi found a similar lifeform injured on their planet and, while attempting to care for it, they also exploited its ability to synthesize matter to create Farpoint Station. The creature now in orbit is trying to help free its mate by attacking those who hold it captive.|$|E
5|$|Ef: The Latter Tale begins {{once again}} with Yuko Amamiya and Yu Himura {{in the middle of}} a reunion in a church during Christmas time. Yuko tells Yu how she has {{influenced}} people in two separate stories (from Ef: The First Tale). After she is done with this, she asks him to tell her about the people he has influenced. Yu starts to tell his first story, that of Chihiro Shindo; the third chapter begins. Like Yuko, Yu also abruptly appears <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere</b> and disappears just as mysteriously. He often gives advice and warnings to Renji and others. Yu is close to Chihiro and takes care of her. After the conclusion of the third chapter, the story goes back to Yuko and Yu with Yu ending his recount of the third chapter, and goes on to talk about how he and Yuko were separated in the past. Yu starts his recount of the events from the fourth chapter. At the end of the fourth chapter, the story shifts one final time back to Yuko and Yu. Up to this point the two have been recounting individual tales to each other. The meaning of the overall title Ef: A Fairy Tale of the Two is revealed to be in connection with Yuko and Yu.|$|E

Each show predominantly features stereotypically feminine lesbian characters. Showtime’s soap opera The L Word follows a closelyknit web of lesbian friends and lovers living in West Hollywood. Bravo’s reality series Work Out stars openly lesbian gym owner and personal trainer Jackie Warner, and shows the daily lives of Warner, her entourage of personal trainers, and their clients. The N Network’s South <b>of</b> <b>Nowhere</b> is a teen drama about a family dealing with charged issues like teen pregnancy, interracial families, and the daughter’s coming out experiences...|$|R

25|$|The Mongols {{also used}} {{deception}} {{very well in}} their wars. For instance, when approaching a mobile army the units would be split into three or more army groups, each trying to outflank and surprise their opponents. This created many battlefield scenarios for the opponents where the Mongols would seem to appear <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere</b> and there were seemingly more of them than in actuality. Flanking and/or feigned retreat if the enemy could not be handled easily {{was one of the}} most practiced techniques. Other techniques used commonly by the Mongols were completely psychological and were used to entice/lure enemies into vulnerable positions by showing themselves from a hill or some other predetermined locations, then disappearing into the woods or behind hills while the Mongols' flank troops already strategically positioned would appear as if <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere</b> from the left, right and/or from their rear. During the initial states of battlefield contact, while camping in close proximity of their enemies at night, they would feign numerical superiority by ordering each soldier to light at least five fires, which would appear to the enemy scouts and spies that their force was almost five times larger than it actually was.|$|E
5000|$|After {{earning his}} GED from a Massachusetts junior college, Adams {{enrolled}} at UNLV {{to play for}} the Jerry Tarkanian-coached Runnin' Rebels basketball team. A [...] center, he was known as an athletic player with great leaping ability who rose to prominence <b>out</b> <b>of</b> seemingly <b>nowhere.</b> Other than taking one season off during school to deal with family issues back in New York, Adams starred at UNLV. During his career he scored 1,168 points and grabbed 623 rebounds (his rebound total was a school-record at the time). In one game against Utah State, Adams scored 37 points and grabbed 18 rebounds, and it was speculated that during Adams' prime he could out-rebound Dennis Rodman. The 1983-84 and 1984-85 seasons, his junior and senior seasons, respectively, Adams was named the back-to-back Pacific Coast Athletic Association Player of the Year. He averaged 12.7 points and 6.7 rebounds his junior year and 16.1 and 7.9 as a senior.|$|R
5000|$|Super Goof's secret {{identity}} is {{known only to}} his nephew Gilbert (and, in French-produced Super Goof stories, to Mickey Mouse as well). This is {{despite the fact that}} Super Goof does not wear a mask, his costume consisting solely of a red union suit and a cape (that appear <b>out</b> <b>of</b> seemingly <b>nowhere</b> whenever Goofy eats a goober and change back to his regular clothes when the powers wear off), a likely parody of Superman's poor yet effective means to conceal his identity. Comic relief in the stories would spring from the fact that Super Goof's powers would [...] "wear off" [...] at the least opportune moments, such as when he was flying or in need of super strength. Goofy always kept a few super goobers in his hat, but would occasionally forget to restock, leading to situations in which he would have to get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> trouble without the super powers. In a crossover story, Huey, Dewey and Louie found a super goober plant sprouted by a dropped goober, and [...] "borrowed" [...] Super Goof's powers; after doing a round of super deeds, the ducks' powers faded, and they had to be rescued by the Junior Woodchucks.|$|R

She tells this to Vansh but Sheel poisons his ears against Vaishnavi instead and Vansh throws her <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the house. <b>Nowhere</b> to go, Vaishnavi leaves for Jammu, her native. Out here in Jammu, she brings Saunakshi back home and lives happy with her father occasionally remembering Vansh and her in-laws.

25|$|In Allen's opinion, {{the problem}} with Funny Lady was that Barbra Streisand had not {{wanted to do a}} sequel to Funny Girl and was {{determined}} to give the director, Herbert Ross, a hard time. Ray Stark had her cross-collateralized on three films and she was, figuratively speaking, escorted to the set every day by a team of lawyers. The picture does, however, contain some of Allen's most satisfying work, some of which she doesn't remember writing and just seems to have come <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{mainstream}} academic {{theory is}} that writing first appeared during the Sumerian civilisation in southern Mesopotamia, around 3300–3200 BC. {{in the form of}} the Cuneiform script. This first writing system did not suddenly appear <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere,</b> but gradually developed from less stylised pictographic systems that used ideographic and mnemonic symbols that contained meaning, but did not have the linguistic flexibility of the natural language writing system that the Sumerians first conceived. These earlier symbolic systems have been labelled as proto-writing, examples of which have been discovered in a variety of places around the world, some dating back to the 7th millennium BC.|$|E

25|$|The Animus Project Update 1.0 {{included}} a new game mode {{and a new}} map. The game mode, Advanced Alliance, is {{a version of the}} Alliance mode, with target identification and engagement more difficult than in the original, thus providing a more challenging experience for players. With three teams of two players each, Advanced Alliance is a tougher test for players and rewards teams that work together. The new map, Mont Saint-Michel, is located on a rocky tidal island of Normandy in France. Its particular topography of narrow streets, high-perched bell-tower, and multi-leveled architecture is perfect for hunters and predators alike to surge from <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere</b> to execute their prey. To survive, recruits need to use free-running and narrow roads to their advantage.|$|E

25|$|Though the duo never stated so outright, their {{additional}} {{motivation in}} {{getting involved with}} KK Partizan again was perceived to be gaining the upper hand on the club's eventual privatisation process once the new Law on Sports gets passed in the Serbian parliament. Since the exact ownership structure of a publicly owned KK Partizan wasn't and still isn't really clear, potential investors decided to stay away, {{at least until the}} law appears. Divac and Danilović appeared pretty much <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere</b> in this regard but enjoyed plenty of fan and public support because most preferred to see their beloved club owned and operated by its former stars rather than a faceless corporation or a group of politicians, managers or businessmen close to the ruling coalition. However, after a few years the duo ran out of patience and pulled out of the venture in late 2004 because it became too much of a financial burden with no end-goal in sight. While he stopped performing any official functions at the club, Divac continues to be involved with it in a lesser capacity.|$|E

Nicole, thinking the man has left, attempts to open the lock. The driver appears <b>out</b> <b>of</b> seemingly <b>nowhere,</b> and bites Nicole's finger off.

The driver feeds a hose through the window and starts pouring gasoline into the room. Nicole tries to find an escape and is able to open a hatch in the ceiling. Realizing there is no way for her to get him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the building the officer tells Nicole to use the two remaining bullets in his gun to kill him because he would rather die that way than be burned alive.
