25|$|A well {{recorded}} as Bloak Well was first discovered in 1800, around 1826 (Paterson 1866) or 1810 or 1800, {{by the fact}} that pigeons from Lainshaw House and the neighbouring parishes were found to flock here to drink. Mr. Cunningham of Lainshaw built a handsome house over the well in 1833 and appointed a keeper {{to take care of it}} as the mineral water was <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>value</b> owing to healing properties attributed to it. The well was located in the middle of the kitchen.|$|E
25|$|Many stream ciphers {{are based}} on linear-feedback shift {{registers}} (LFSRs), which, while efficient in hardware, are less so in software. The design of RC4 avoids the use of LFSRs and is ideal for software implementation, as it requires only byte manipulations. It uses 256 bytes of memory for the state array, S through S, k bytes of memory for the key, key through key, and integer variables, i, j, and K. Performing a modular reduction <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>value</b> modulo 256 {{can be done with}} a bitwise AND with 255 (which is equivalent to taking the low-order byte of the value in question).|$|E
25|$|The bludger, Carangoides gymnostethus (also {{known as}} the bludger {{trevally}}, nakedbreast trevally and Bleeker’s jackfish), is a widespread species of large marine fish in the jack family, Carangidae. The bludger inhabits the tropical and subtropical regions of the Indo-west Pacific Ocean, distributed from South Africa {{in the west to}} Japan and New Caledonia in the east. It is a large fish, growing to a maximum recorded length of 90cm, and is very similar to the yellowspotted trevally, Carangoides fulvoguttatus, but can be separated by the complete absence of breast scales {{and a number of other}} anatomical features. The species inhabits moderately deep offshore coral and rocky reefs, where it preys on small crustaceans and fish. The reproductive biology of the species is poorly known, but it appears to move to more tropical waters to spawn. The bludger is of intermediate importance to fisheries throughout its range, taken by hook and line and various netting methods. It is <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>value</b> to anglers also, considered a good gamefish, but generally regarded as poor eating due to its soft oily flesh, which is used as bait by many anglers. The name ‘bludger’ is said to either refer to the blunt head of the species, or the destination of the fish when caught by professional fishermen who treat the fish as discard.|$|E

2500|$|A mineral {{spring is}} {{recorded}} as being near Stewarton, North Ayrshire, called the Bloak Well. Robinson gives the Scot's word 'blout' as meaning the 'eruption of fluid'.

2500|$|Bill was {{enthusiastic}} about his experience; {{he felt it}} helped him eliminate many barriers erected by the self, or ego, that {{stand in the way}} of one's direct experience of the cosmos and of God. He thought he might have found something that could make a big difference to the lives of many who still suffered. Bill is quoted as saying: [...] "It is a generally acknowledged fact in spiritual development that ego reduction makes the influx of God's grace possible. If, therefore, under LSD [...] we can have a temporary reduction, so that we can better see what we are and where we are going — well, that might be of some help. The goal might become clearer. So I consider LSD to be <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>value</b> to some people, and practically no damage to anyone. It will never take the place of any of the existing means by which we can reduce the ego, and keep it reduced." [...] Wilson felt that regular usage of LSD in a carefully controlled, structured setting would be beneficial for many recovering alcoholics. However, he felt this method only should be attempted by individuals with well-developed super-egos.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{studies of}} alcoholics who {{underwent}} LSD treatment reported a 50% success rate after a single high-dose session. However, {{the studies that}} reported high success rates had insufficient controls, lacked objective measures of genuine change, and failed to conduct rigorous follow-up interviews with subjects. The lack of conclusive evidence notwithstanding, individual case reports are often dramatic. Bill Wilson, the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous conducted medically supervised experiments in the 1950s {{on the effects of}} LSD on alcoholism. Bill is quoted as saying [...] "It is a generally acknowledged fact in spiritual development that ego reduction makes the influx of God's grace possible. If, therefore, under LSD we can have a temporary reduction, so that we can better see what we are and where we are going—well, that might be of some help. The goal might become clearer.

[...] Wilson felt that regular usage of LSD in a carefully controlled, structured setting would be beneficial for many recovering alcoholics. However, he felt this method only should be attempted by individuals with well-developed super-egos. In 1957 Wilson wrote a letter to Heard saying: [...] "I am certain that the LSD experiment has helped me very much. I find myself with a heightened colour perception and an appreciation of beauty almost destroyed by my years of depressions." [...] Most AA members were strongly opposed to his experimenting with a mind-altering substance.|$|E
