25|$|For instance, palladium(II) acetate {{is reduced}} by {{triphenylphosphine}} to bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (1) and triphenylphosphine is oxidized to triphenylphosphine oxide. Step A is an <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> in which palladium inserts itself in the aryl to bromide bond. Palladium then forms a π complex with the alkene (3) and in step B the alkene inserts itself in the palladium - carbon bond in a syn addition step. Then follows a torsional strain relieving rotation to the trans isomer (not shown) and step C is a beta-hydride elimination step {{with the formation of}} a new palladium - alkene π complex (5). This complex is destroyed in the next step. The palladium(0) compound is regenerated by reductive elimination of the palladium(II) compound by potassium carbonate in the final step, D. In the course of the reaction the carbonate is stoichiometrically consumed and palladium is truly a catalyst and used in catalytic amounts. A similar palladium cycle but with different scenes and actors is observed in the Wacker process.|$|E

40|$|Integration of voltammetry, surface-enhanced Raman {{spectroscopy}} (SEAS), {{and density}} functional theory (DFT) has allowed unraveling the mechanistic {{origin of the}} exceptional electrocatalytic properties of silver cathodes during the reduction of benzyl chloride. At inert electrodes the initial reduction proceeds through a concerted direct electron transfer yielding a benzyl radical as the first intermediate. Conversely, at silver electrodes it involves an uphill preadsorption of benzyl chloride onto the silver cathode. Reduction of this adduct affords a species tentatively described as a distorted benzyl radical anion stabilized by the silver surface. This transient species rapidly evolves to yield ultimately a benzyl radical bound onto the silver surface, the latter being reduced into a benzyl-silver anionic adduct which eventually dissociates into a free benzyl anion at more negative potentials. Within this framework, the exceptional electrocatalytic properties of silver cathodes stem {{from the fact that}} they drastically modify the mechanism of the 2 e-reduction pathway through a direct consequence of the electrophilicity of silver cathode surfaces toward organic halides. This mechanism contrasts drastically with any of those tentatively invoked previously, and bridges classical electroreduction mechanisms and <b>oxidative</b> <b>additions</b> similar to those occurring during organometallic homogeneous activation of organic halides by low-valent transition-metal complexes...|$|R

A variation on this theme is rollover cyclometalation where a bidentate donor, such as 2, 2 '-bipyridine, upon C-H activation leads to a species with a free donor atom that is able to influence the properties, hence the reactivity, of the complex. We explored the similarities/differences between classical and rollover cyclometalation to check the importance of the second nitrogen donor by comparing suitably substituted 2, 2 '-bipyridines and 2 -phenylpyridines; moreover the properties of the ligands were tuned to investigate the impact of stereoelectronic modification on the C-H activation process.
