In this position Brand followed the habit <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lifetime,</b> and it earned him a British knighthood.

Reitz stood candidate and won a landslide victory on the ticket of Afrikaner nationalism. He was inaugurated as state president in the Tweetoringkerk (Two-Towers Church) in Bloemfontein on 10 January 1889.|$|E
