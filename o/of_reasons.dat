5000|$|According to French {{historian}} Michel Vovelle, the Cult <b>of</b> <b>Reason</b> {{first appeared}} during the trial of Marie Antoinette, but took off after the execution of Antoinette. The Cult <b>of</b> <b>Reason</b> was founded by Jacques Hébert and his followers. The Cult <b>of</b> <b>Reason</b> was the first official state sponsored, civic, and atheistic religion of the French Republic from October 1793 until March 1794. The Cult <b>of</b> <b>Reason</b> became popular among intellectuals and sans culottes alike. From mid-1793 the Jacobin-dominated French Convention gave tacit approval to the Cult <b>of</b> <b>Reason.</b> On 6 October 1793, the National Convention replaced the Gregorian calendar for the French Republican Calendar for France. Together with Pierre Gaspard Chaumette, Joseph Fouché, in the Nièvre department, Fouché ransacked churches, sent their valuables to the treasury, and ordered the words [...] "Death is an eternal sleep" [...] to be inscribed over the gates to cemeteries. On 10 November 1793, the Festival <b>of</b> <b>Reason</b> {{was held in the}} Notre-Dame de Paris, a newly converted Temple <b>of</b> <b>Reason.</b> [...] Historian Gavin Flood says, [...] "During the French Revolution in 1793 the Gothic Cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris was rededicated to the Cult <b>of</b> <b>Reason,</b> an atheistic doctrine intended to replace Christianity."The Cult <b>of</b> <b>Reason</b> vanished quickly, after its chief exponents, Jacques Hébert and his followers were guillotined on 24 March 1794.|$|R

50|$|The moralities <b>of</b> <b>reason</b> {{and desire}} are both {{vulnerable}} to serious objections. The morality of desire is deficient {{because it is}} incapable of passing from description to evaluation of conduct, and thus is unable to lay down standards of justification. Furthermore, the life to which morality of desire points is inadequate; contentment is elusive without any criteria to judge and order the ends of conduct. The morality <b>of</b> <b>reason</b> is inadequate, first, due to the inadequacy <b>of</b> <b>reason</b> {{to serve as a}} foundation for any moral judgments and, second, because the moral life as conceived by the moralist <b>of</b> <b>reason</b> is inadequate.The respective inadequacies of moralities <b>of</b> desire and <b>reason</b> generate an antinomy. If morality of desire abandons us to our random and changing appetites, morality <b>of</b> <b>reason</b> suppresses our existence as subjective beings with individual ends. The root of this antinomy <b>of</b> <b>reason</b> and desire is the separation between understanding and evaluation in liberal doctrine.|$|R

5|$|A workhouse {{was built}} in Lurgan and opened in 1841 under the stipulations of the Poor Law which stated that each Poor Law Union would build a workhouse to give relief to the {{increasing}} numbers of destitute poor. In 1821 the population of Lurgan was 2,715, this increased to 4,677 by 1841. There were a couple <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> for this large growth in population. Firstly the opportunities provided by the booming linen industry led many to abandon their meagre living in rural areas and migrate to Lurgan {{in the hope of}} gaining employment. Secondly the ever-expanding town gave tradesmen the opportunity to secure work in the construction of new buildings such as Brownlow House.|$|E
