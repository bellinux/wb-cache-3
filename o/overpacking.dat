The structure of the I form has been investigated thoroughly, with significant effort devoted to identifying potentially stabilizing native contacts. Here, we test whether rigid side-chain packing interactions like those in holomyoglobin persist at a buried position, Met- 131, within the low-pH apoMb intermediate. We have measured the urea-induced unfolding transitions of <b>overpacking,</b> underpacking, and polar substitutions of Met- 131 {{to determine the effect}} on the stability of the native and intermediate states of apoMb. Whereas underpacking substitutions should destabilize the I form irrespective of the degree of native side-chain-packing interactions, we anticipate that <b>overpacking</b> replacements might show opposite effects in a tightly packed environment, compared with a region lacking native side-chain packing interactions. We observe that, whereas underpacking and polar substitutions destabilize the I form, <b>overpacking</b> substitutions are stabilizing, implying that I is structurally plastic.

This fuel is soon to be retrieved from buried storage and packaged into new containers (<b>overpacks)</b> for interim storage at the Hanford Interim Storage Area (ISA). One of the key activities associated with this effort is final closure of the <b>overpack</b> by welding. The OSU fuel is placed into an <b>overpack,</b> a head inserted into the <b>overpack</b> top, and welded closed. Weld quality, for typical welded fabrication, is established through post-weld testing and nondestructive examination (NDE); however, in this case, once the SNF is placed into the <b>overpack,</b> routine testing and NDE are not feasible.

40|$|AbstractDevelopment of {{a tightly}} packed {{hydrophobic}} core drives the folding of water-soluble globular proteins {{and is a}} key determinant of protein stability. Despite this, there remains much to be learnt about how and when the hydrophobic core becomes desolvated and tightly packed during protein folding. We have used the bacterial immunity protein Im 7 to examine the specificity of hydrophobic core packing during folding. This small, four-helix protein has previously been shown to fold via a compact three-helical intermediate state. Here, <b>overpacking</b> substitutions, in which residue side-chain size is increased, were {{used to examine the}} specificity and malleability of core packing in the folding intermediate and rate-limiting transition state. In parallel, polar groups were introduced into the Im 7 hydrophobic core via Val→Thr or Phe→Tyr substitutions and used to determine the solvation status of core residues at different stages of folding. Over 30 Im 7 variants were created allowing both series of substitutions to cover all regions of the protein structure. Φ-value analysis demonstrated that the major changes in Im 7 core solvation occur prior to the population of the folding intermediate, with key regions involved in docking of the short helix III remaining solvent-exposed until after the rate-limiting transition state has been traversed. In contrast, <b>overpacking</b> core residues revealed that some regions of the native Im 7 core are remarkably malleable to increases in side-chain volume. <b>Overpacking</b> residues in other regions of the Im 7 core result in substantial (> 2. 5  kJ mol− 1) destabilisation of the native structure or even prevents efficient folding to the native state. This study provides new insights into Im 7 folding; demonstrating that whilst desolvation occurs early during folding, adoption of a specifically packed core is achieved only at the very last step in the folding mechanism...|$|E

A concrete cask usually consists of a metallic canister which confines the spent nuclear fuel assemblies and a concrete <b>overpack.</b> When the <b>overpack</b> undergoes a missile impact, which might {{be caused by a}} tornado or an aircraft crash, it should sustain an acceptable level of structural integrity so that its radiation shielding capability and the retrievability of the canister are maintained.

The local damage of concrete is usually evaluated by empirical formulas, while the global damage is evaluated by finite element analysis. However, this decoupled approach may lead to a very conservative estimation of both damages. In this research, finite element analysis with material failure models and element erosion is applied to the evaluation of local and global damage of concrete <b>overpacks</b> under high speed missile impacts. Two types of concrete <b>overpacks</b> with different configurations are considered.

In contrast, each native form exists in a metastable state in inhibitory serpins (serine protease inhibitors) and some viral membrane fusion proteins.
