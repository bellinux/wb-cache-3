Multimedia enables teachers to speak to their pupils and students through pictures and sounds. Computer presentation accompanies the teacher in the teaching process that thus becomes more comprehensive, well-considered and effective.

There {{is no doubt that}} the competence and skill in creating a multimedia computer presentation is one of the essential attributions of a teacher at any level of the educational system. We would like to outline the way of our realization of presentation creation teaching at Pedagogical Faculty of Ostrava University in Ostrava, Czech Republic. Our experience indicates that presentation creation must result from a detailed plan which is worked-out in advance.

40|$|When a university’s {{syllabus}} is {{not clear}} students may feel they {{have every right to}} challenge a final grade and/or often dictate to the professor the terms by which they are to be graded! To avoid issues with final grades that students earn and/or prevent the instructor from losing focus of important content items that need to be taught, a clearly written, explicit syllabus needs to be in place and constructed so that there is a system wide template. This document will present important points to consider when developing a course syllabus and a companion course outline. Rationale A well written syllabus is a contract between the University and the student(s). It is to be considered the “law of the land ” during the course and even afterward in case a dispute does arise in regard to a student’s final grade. A contract is a “meeting of the minds”, in that the instructor explains what the syllabus means, contains, consists of and/or sets specific expectation for student assignments. In turn, the student must follow, to the letter, the contents of the syllabus in order for there to be a successful outcome leading to the student’s understanding of his or her grade earned. Theoretical Framework A repository for a template of a standard University syllabus and outline is mandatory. National University upholds the philosophy that, “The content of these courses are the intellectual identity of the larger Academic institution…it must be the best it can be … yet where are they, as faculty, to find elements that supplement content in a way that serves the course and its students? (Fawson, nd). Based on this theoretical premise, National University has created a system called NU-FAST in which syllabi, course outlines, sample capstone assignments, forms, power points, and student handbooks are located in an electronic file system. NU-FAST is used for either <b>onsite</b> or <b>online</b> <b>courses</b> and “as faculty have access to training and technology t...|$|R

Rapid growth of K- 12 e-learning demands a powerful Learning Management System (LMS) for <b>online</b> <b>course</b> delivery. When legacy <b>online</b> <b>courses</b> were moved from early generation LMSs to more advanced LMSs, <b>online</b> <b>course</b> migration processes {{were needed to}} be understood by stakeholders (e. g. LMS vendors, school administrators, instructional designers, instructors, and students). In this study, 175 self-paced <b>online</b> <b>courses</b> and 31 semester-based <b>online</b> <b>courses</b> were migrated from two previous LMSs into Canvas LMS. A wide range of data were collected and analyzed to identify instructional designers’ experience in this <b>online</b> <b>course</b> migration process. Key {{findings of this study}} identified <b>online</b> <b>course</b> migration processes in five categories: project planning and management, course migration exploration, course migration enactment, course migration evaluation, and project reflection. Further, the differences and similarities between self-paced and semester-based <b>online</b> <b>course</b> migrations were identified focusing on course migration procedures and the Canvas LMS feature. The findings of this study will be helpful for relevant stakeholders to understand on how instructional designers migrated <b>online</b> <b>courses</b> from different LMSs to Canvas, and what supports need to be provided for <b>online</b> <b>course</b> migration practice.

The number of students who fail an <b>online</b> <b>course</b> is, also, of concern. As <b>online</b> <b>courses</b> may continue to grow over the next few decades, studies on persistence in <b>online</b> <b>courses</b> may benefit students, administrators, instructional designers, educators, and researchers. Although previous research studies have addressed persistence in <b>online</b> <b>courses,</b> very few examine it from the perspectives of students who were unsuccessful in their courses. These students may have unique insights about the online experience that may have related to their lack of success. The purpose of this study was to understand the experiences of university students who have failed or dropped an <b>online</b> <b>course</b> through the lenses of transactional distance theory and Kember’s model of dropout in distance education. Transactional distance theory discusses the dialog, structure, and learner autonomy involved in an <b>online</b> <b>course,</b> while, Kember’s model presents categories that may relate to dropping an <b>online</b> <b>course.</b> Together, the theory and model may help in understanding the experiences of students who have dropped or failed an <b>online</b> <b>course.</b> In this study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 participants from a large Southeastern university in the United States. Based on the participants’ responses, the data was sorted and ranked according to the amount of transactional distance in their courses, as well as the categories of Kember’s model. Many of the participants who experienced low or high transactional distance have, also, expressed an issue with the goal commitment category of Kember’s model. Additionally, there were important differences in the student characteristics of those who dropped or failed an <b>online</b> <b>course.</b> Furthermore, suggestions for improving <b>online</b> <b>courses</b> were given by the participants. Some of these suggestions included more student-instructor interactions, the use of more technology tools in their <b>online</b> <b>course,</b> and for orientations to the online environment to be offered. ...|$|R
