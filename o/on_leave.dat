5|$|Donen's {{next film}} was Kiss Them for Me. He was {{personally}} asked by Cary Grant to direct and began developing it while still under contract at MGM. With a plot that strongly resembles On the Town, the film features Grant, Ray Walston and Larry Blyden as three navy officers <b>on</b> <b>leave</b> in San Francisco in 1944. Unlike On the Town, Kiss Them for Me {{is a dark}} comedy that contrasts the officers' selfless heroism with their self-absorbed hedonism while <b>on</b> <b>leave.</b> The film was released in 1957 to mostly poor reviews.|$|E
