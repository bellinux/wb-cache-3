The basic body type is a {{terrestrial}} quadruped, but some mammals are adapted for life at sea, in the air, in trees, underground or <b>on</b> <b>two</b> <b>legs.</b> The {{largest group of}} mammals, the placentals, have a placenta, which enables the feeding of the fetus during gestation.|$|E
5|$|Laws {{have been}} passed {{in many areas of}} the world to protect bears from habitat destruction. Public {{perception}} of bears is often positive, as people identify with bears due to their omnivorous diets, their ability to stand <b>on</b> <b>two</b> <b>legs,</b> and their symbolic importance. Support for bear protection is widespread, at least in more affluent societies. Where bears raid crops or attack livestock, they may come into conflict with humans. In poorer rural regions, attitudes may be more shaped by the dangers posed by bears and the economic costs they cause to farmers and ranchers.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the live albums Live <b>on</b> <b>Two</b> <b>Legs,</b> Live at Benaroya Hall, Live in NYC 12/31/92, Live at Easy Street, Live at the Gorge 05/06, Live at Lollapalooza 2007, Live on Ten Legs and myriad live versions of studio songs spread across singles as B-sides, the band has released an official bootlegs series of live recordings for each show of each tour since its 2000 European tour, {{with the exception of}} the 2004 Vote for Change tour and its 2007 European tour. The band has sold more than 3.5 millioncopies of shows since launching the bootleg series in 2000. For its 2000 and 2003 tours the bootlegs consisted of double-disc (and sometimes triple-disc) albums. The bootleg series switched over to MP3 format for the band's 2005 shows and expanded to include lossless FLAC format for its 2006 tour. Official bootlegs are available for the band's 2008 United States Tour and 2009 North American Tour in FLAC, MP3, and CD formats.|$|E

In October 2009, Pearl Jam headlined the Austin City Limits Music Festival. Later in October on Halloween night, {{the band played}} in what was the last {{performance}} at the Philadelphia Spectrum. An additional leg consisting of a tour of Oceania took place afterwards. In May 2010, the band embarked on a month-long tour starting with the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival. The tour headed to the East Coast and ended May 21, 2010 at Madison Square Garden in New York. A European tour took place in June and July 2010, where the band performed in Northern Ireland {{for the first time}} at the Odyssey Arena in Belfast. In late October 2010, Pearl Jam performed at the 24th Annual Bridge School Benefit Concert at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, California. A live album, titled Live on Ten Legs, was released on January 17, 2011. It is a compilation of live tracks from their 2003 to 2010 world tours, and is a follow-up to Live <b>on</b> <b>Two</b> <b>Legs,</b> which consisted of songs recorded during their 1998 North American tour.|$|E
5|$|When the Supercopa Sudamericana {{was created}} in 1988, a new {{continental}} Super Cup competition in South America became viable. CONMEBOL named the new competition Recopa Sudamericana after the defunct Recopa Sudamericana de Clubes played in 1970 and 1971. The Recopa Sudamericana, disputed between the winners of South America's two premier club competitions, is not related chronologically to the Recopa Sudamericana, created in 1968 which was contested between former South American winners of the Intercontinental Cup, Recopa Sudamericana de Clubes, disputed among Cup winners of South America. The first edition was played in 1989 and pitted Uruguayan club Nacional and Argentinian side Racing. Played <b>on</b> <b>two</b> <b>legs,</b> Nacional managed to win the trophy after winning 4–1 on points. Due to schedule dilemmas and political issues, the 1990 edition was played in Miami between Atlético Nacional and Boca Juniors with the latter winning 0–1. Olimpia of Paraguay would win the Recopa Sudamericana without the need to dispute a match as the Decano won both the Copa Libertadores and Supercopa Sudamericana. CONMEBOL declared Olimpia the automatic winners of the 1991 competition.|$|E

25|$|A {{larger number}} of modern species {{intermittently}} or briefly use a bipedal gait. Several lizard species move bipedally when running, usually to escape from threats. Many primate and bear species will adopt a bipedal gait {{in order to reach}} food or explore their environment. Several arboreal primate species, such as gibbons and indriids, exclusively walk <b>on</b> <b>two</b> <b>legs</b> during the brief periods they spend on the ground. Many animals rear up on their hind legs whilst fighting or copulating. Some animals commonly stand on their hind legs, in order to reach food, to keep watch, to threaten a competitor or predator, or to pose in courtship, but do not move bipedally.|$|E
25|$|As mounted, the {{vertebral}} column of E. annectens includes twelve neck, twelve back, nine sacral, {{and at least}} thirty tail vertebrae. The limb bones were longer and more lightly built than those of other hadrosaurids of comparable size. E. annectens had a distinctive pelvis, based on the proportions and form of the pubis bone. E. annectens, like other hadrosaurids, could move both <b>on</b> <b>two</b> <b>legs</b> and on four legs. It probably preferred to forage for food on four legs, but ran on two. Henry Fairfield Osborn used the skeletons in the American Museum of Natural History to portray both quadrupedal and bipedal stances for E. annectens.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-20th century, Ichiro Kato {{professor}} of Waseda University studied humanoid robots. He initiated the WABOT project in 1967, and in 1972 completed the WABOT-1, the world's first full-scale humanoid intelligent robot. WABOT-1 had two arms, walked <b>on</b> <b>two</b> <b>legs,</b> and sees with two camera eyes. It was thus the first android. Its limb control system {{allowed it to}} walk with the lower limbs, and to grip and transport objects with hands, using tactile sensors. Its vision system allowed it to measure distances and directions to objects using external receptors, artificial eyes and ears. And its conversation system allowed it to communicate with a person in Japanese, with an artificial mouth. Japan has since been leading the field of robotics.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the mysteries}} about Leptictidium is whether it moved by running or by jumping. Because {{there are very few}} {{completely}} bipedal mammals, it is difficult to find an appropriate living model to compare it with. If the kangaroo is used, it is probable that Leptictidium hopped along with its body tilted forward, using its tail as a counterweight. On the other hand, elephant shrews combine both types of locomotion; they usually move on four legs, but they can run <b>on</b> <b>two</b> <b>legs</b> to flee from a predator. Studies of the bone structure of Leptictidium have yielded contradicting information: its leg articulations appear too weak to have supported the shock of repeated jumps, but its long feet were obviously adapted for jumping rather than running.|$|E
25|$|Continuing their touring {{commitment}} into 1999, Garbage {{launched a}} European arena tour on January 14 at Dublin's Point Theatre. Local acts such as Laurent Garnier and The Rasmus supported continental dates; Moloko supported Irish and UK shows. Concerts in Paris and St. Petersburg were filmed to be broadcast by MTV Europe and MTV Russia respectively. A show in Tallinn was cancelled {{on the day}} when the band's equipment was held up by customs officials at the Estonian border. The European run ended in Madrid on February 11. Garbage then returned to North America to support Alanis Morissette <b>on</b> <b>two</b> <b>legs</b> of the Junkie Tour, starting on February 16 in Cincinnati, Ohio, routing along the Midwest, Four Corners states and onto the West Coast, ending on April 7 in Los Angeles.|$|E
25|$|Many locals say Orang Pendek's feet {{look like}} those of a child, {{evidenced}} by foot prints they have found while walking through the forest. However, another local animal, the sun bear, is a possible source of these sightings. Bears in general are known for having feet that look quite human-like, and the size of a sun bear's {{are similar to those of}} a child. In addition, gibbons populate the forests in this area and are known to occasionally descend to the ground and walk for a few seconds at a time <b>on</b> <b>two</b> <b>legs.</b> Witnesses could possibly be seeing orangutans; however: 1) this species has long been thought to have died out in all but the northern regions of Sumatra and 2) witnesses almost never describe the animal as having orange fur.|$|E

500|$|One {{hypothesized}} {{feeding behavior}} strategy considers {{them to be}} low-level browsers, eating low-growing fruit of various nonflowering plants, as well as foliage.

Many of these books are completely anthropomorphic, dressing farm animals in clothes and having them walk <b>on</b> <b>two</b> <b>legs,</b> live in houses, and perform human activities.

500|$|Large meat-eating dinosaurs had {{a complex}} system of air sacs {{similar to those}} found in modern birds, {{according}} to a 2005 investigation led by Patrick M. O'Connor. The lungs of theropod dinosaurs (carnivores that walked <b>on</b> <b>two</b> <b>legs</b> and had bird-like feet) likely pumped air into hollow sacs in their skeletons, {{as is the case in}} birds. [...] "What was once formally considered unique to birds was present in some form in the ancestors of birds", O'Connor said. In 2008, scientists described Aerosteon riocoloradensis, the skeleton of which supplies the strongest evidence to date of a dinosaur with a bird-like breathing system. CT-scanning of Aerosteons fossil bones revealed evidence for the existence of air sacs within the animal's body cavity.|$|E
