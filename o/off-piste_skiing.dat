50|$|In Europe and Canada <b>off-piste</b> <b>skiing</b> is {{generally}} permitted at ski resorts. In the United States <b>off-piste</b> <b>skiing</b> {{may or may}} not be; regulations vary by ski area. Many ski resorts prohibit it outright and some simply post warning signs that skiers are leaving the patrolled ski area boundaries.|$|E

50|$|Backcountry and <b>off-piste</b> <b>skiing</b> can be {{hazardous}} due to avalanche, exhaustion, weather, cliffs, rock fall, and tree wells. Avalanches result in about one fatality per {{month in the}} United States.|$|E
5|$|Heli-skiing gives {{ready access}} to many remote or <b>off-piste</b> <b>ski</b> routes in the Mont Blanc massif. Because heli-skiing is banned across France for {{environmental}} reasons, companies offering this service only operate on the Swiss and Italian sides of the range.|$|R
50|$|The Vallée Blanche ski run is a 20 km long, unmarked <b>off-piste</b> <b>ski</b> route {{which begins}} very steeply from the Aiguille du Midi station and, {{because of its}} {{complexity}} across crevassed glaciated terrain and need for route-finding, is best undertaken with a mountain guide.|$|R
50|$|The {{length and}} {{width of the}} ski define its total surface area, which {{provides}} some indication of the ski's float, or ability to remain {{on top of the}} snow instead of sinking into it. Cross-country skis must be narrow to reduce drag, and thus must be long to produce the required float. Alpine skis are generally not designed to reduce drag, and tend to be shorter and wider. Skis used in downhill race events are longer, with a subtle side cut, built for speed and wide turns. Slalom skis, as well as many recreational skis, are shorter with a greater side cut to facilitate tighter, easier turns. For <b>off-piste</b> <b>skis</b> the trend is towards wider skis that better float on top of powder snow. The ski width of all-mountain and <b>off-piste</b> <b>skis</b> has generally increased since the 1990's when 85 mm width was considered a wide powderski. From 2010 and onwards, many well known ski manufacturers sell all-round freeride skis for the general public starting in the 90mm range and going up to 120 mm or more.|$|R

50|$|The {{lower section}} of the slopes are through trees, which means they are not exposed to wind and sun and tend to have better snow cover, {{although}} the scope for <b>off-piste</b> <b>skiing</b> is limited. Above the trees, from 2100m upwards, there is an abundance of <b>off-piste</b> <b>skiing</b> to be found. Impressive backcountry skiing can be found past the slopes at the Lanslevillard end of the resort, with several wide gullies within a large forested area. From {{the top of the}} TSF4 de la Met lift to 2800m there are panoramic views of the Lac du Mont Cenis almost 800m below, as well as several pistes running down to the lake's shore.|$|E

5000|$|On 18 January, a {{division}} of 51 Legionnaires, assigned to the 2nd Foreign Engineer Regiment (2nd REG) took part in an <b>off-piste</b> <b>ski</b> mountain exercise, to receive their Skier Certificate (BSM). The (2nd REG) provides combat engineering services to the French Army's 27th Mountain Infantry Brigade, who were also present during the military exercise. The course took place 60 kilometres (35 miles) south of Albertville and near the Valfréjus ski resort, in the Massif des Cerces.|$|R
5000|$|One {{disadvantage}} to the parabolic {{shape is}} that it was much wider at the tip and tail, producing a design with considerable rotational inertia. To offset this effect, the skis had evolved to be much shorter, reducing the moment arm. In spite of the larger [...] "shovels" [...] at the tip and tail, the overall area of the ski was reduced, which led to them tending to sink in soft snow. This left powder <b>skiing</b> and <b>off-piste</b> <b>skis</b> among the few markets not being served by parabolic designs. Several skis aimed at the powder market had appeared over the years, including the Volant Chubb and other [...] "fat-boy skis" [...] from the early to mid 1990s.|$|R
50|$|Ski touring {{requires}} {{the ability to}} <b>ski</b> <b>off-piste,</b> good navigation skills, and good awareness of the risks of the mountain environment in winter. In particular it {{requires the}} knowledge to assess and test snow conditions to minimise the risk of avalanche.|$|R
50|$|As a rule, ski routes allow <b>off-piste</b> <b>skiing</b> in deep {{powder snow}} without {{significant}} risk from avalanches or natural obstacles. Ski routes may also include mogul routes. As {{well as being}} unprepared, ski routes generally follow a challenging course.|$|E
50|$|An old fort perched {{above the}} pass {{suggests}} the region's bloody past. This resort {{is well suited}} for beginners with many gentle slopes leading to a wide area by the bottom lifts. There are many intermediate runs and the chance for <b>off-piste</b> <b>skiing.</b>|$|E
50|$|There are a {{total of}} 52 km (32 mi) of ski runs with 14 ski lifts (six cable cars, seven chair lifts, three railways, and two drag lifts). There is also <b>off-piste</b> <b>skiing,</b> but guiding is often needed and should be used.|$|E
5000|$|La Meije is a {{mountain}} in the Massif des Écrins range, located at {{the border of the}} Hautes-Alpes and Isère départements. It overlooks the nearby village of La Grave, {{a mountain}}eering centre and ski resort, well known for its <b>off-piste</b> and extreme <b>skiing</b> possibilities, and also dominates the view west of the Col du Lautaret. It is the second highest mountain of the Écrins after Barre des Écrins ...|$|R
5000|$|Verbier {{is known}} for its off-piste and {{itinerary}} runs. Amongst these are popular mogul fields Tortin, Gentianes, Mont Fort and Plan du Fou as well as more advanced itineraries Vallon D'Arbi and Mont Gelé (which are often closed). Notable off-piste runs are the Backside of Mont Fort, Bec des Etagnes, Stairway to Heaven, Highway, Marlenaz, Croix de Coeur, Bacombe, Col des Mines, Creblets, Couloir de la Banane, Col de la Mouche, The Rocky Garden, The Hidden Valley (down to Auddes-sur-Riddes), Couloir des Dix, Col de la Banane, and the less accessible Bec des Rosses, annual host for the finals of the Freeride World Tour. <b>Off-pistes</b> <b>skiing</b> can be dangerous, and sometimes lethal, due to the risk of avalanches, hidden obstacles, crevices, extremely steep runs, and other hazards. In the 2012-13 season, a skier was killed by an avalanche on the Col de la Mouche and two others died at the Bec des Etagnes. [...] Verbier is one of only a few resorts to contain a mountain with no pistes coming down it (Mont Gelé). On rare occasions, it is also possible to ski 700 vertical metres from Verbier Village (1500 m) to Le Châble (800 m) in the valley below, though such a run now entails going through terrain with felled trees and other obstacles. The off-piste run from Col des Gentiannes (2,950 m) down to Le Chable is a better option, {{but it is important to}} check that snow conditions are good and that there is no avalanche risk. Also, some of the trails from Col des Gentiannes to Le Châble lead to dead-ends and dangerous rockfaces, so it is essential to be familiar with the terrain before attempting to ski down to Le Châble from Gentiannes.|$|R
50|$|In {{his youth}} {{he was an}} {{excellent}} skier, preferring to <b>ski</b> <b>off-piste</b> on powder snow. There are stories of visitors to his chambers being treated {{to the sight of}} him hopping up the stairs as part of his training for his next skiing trip. His other passions were Russia - he was a champion of Lyra, a Russian chamber choir, and supported the family of a scientist working on the Chernobyl cleanup - and singing. Although he claimed never to have had a music lesson he was a good singer with a clear bass voice.|$|R

5000|$|Its runs face mostly south, {{overlooking}} the Wisconsin River. They range from very gentle to fairly challenging. There {{is also a}} range of terrain park difficulty; one moderately sloped area has low rails and boxes, another has higher jumps, rails, and boxes on a steeper slope, and a third has large jumps. There are no [...] "tree runs" [...] or any <b>off-piste</b> <b>skiing.</b>|$|E
50|$|Originally, skis used in grass skiing {{were like}} rolling treads {{attached}} to the ski boots. Nowadays, {{there are two types}} of skis used in grass skiing. These are the wheeled models and the tracked ones. The wheeled model can be used in various terrains and for freestyle skiing and <b>off-piste</b> <b>skiing.</b> The tracked model on the other hand is specifically designed to be used in grassy slopes.|$|E
5000|$|Situated {{near the}} massive {{peaks of the}} Aiguilles Rouges and most notably the Aiguille du Midi, Chamonix {{is one of the}} oldest ski resorts in France. The north side of the summit of Mont Blanc, and {{therefore}} the summit itself are part of the village of Chamonix. To the south side, the situation is different depending on the country. Italy considers that the border passes through the top. France considers that the boundary runs along the rocky Tournette under the summit cap, placing it entirely in French territory. The south side was in France, assigned to the commune of Saint-Gervais-les-Bains sharing the summit with its neighbor Chamonix. It is this situation [...] "for France," [...] which is found on the French IGN maps. The Chamonix commune is popular with skiers and mountain enthusiasts, and via the cable car lift to the Aiguille du Midi it is possible to access the <b>off-piste</b> (backcountry) <b>ski</b> run of the Vallée Blanche. With an area of 245 km2, Chamonix is the fourth largest commune in area in mainland France.|$|R
40|$|The {{association}} between helmet use during alpine skiing and incidence {{and severity of}} head injuries was analyzed. All patients admitted to a level 1 trauma center for traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) sustained from skiing accidents during the seasons 2000 - 2001 and 2010 - 2011 were eligible. Primary outcome was the {{association between}} helmet use and severity of TBI measured by Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), computed tomography (CT) results, and necessity of neurosurgical intervention. Of 1362 patients injured during alpine skiing, 245 (18 %) sustained TBI and were included. TBI was fatal in 3 %. Head injury was in 76 % minor (Glasgow Coma Scale, 13 - 15), 6 % moderate, and 14 % severe. Number and percentage of TBI patients showed no significant trend over the investigated seasons. Forty-five percent of the 245 patients had pathological CT findings and 26 % of these required neurosurgical intervention. Helmet use increased from 0 % in 2000 - 2001 to 71 % in 2010 - 2011 (p< 0. 001). The main analysis, comparing TBI in patients {{with or without a}} helmet, showed an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 1. 44 (p= 0. 430) for suffering moderate-to-severe head injury in helmet users. Analyses comparing off-piste to on-slope skiers revealed a significantly increased OR among off-piste skiers of 7. 62 (p= 0. 004) for sustaining a TBI requiring surgical intervention. Despite increases in helmet use, we found no decrease in severe TBI among alpine skiers. Logistic regression analysis showed no significant difference in TBI with regard to helmet use, but increased risk for off-piste skiers. The limited protection of helmets and dangers of <b>skiing</b> <b>off-piste</b> should be targeted by prevention programs...|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} good spots for <b>off-piste</b> <b>skiing</b> and snowboarding, {{the best of}} which are: {{to the sides of}} 'Yeti', the long black run off Chamossiere and also by taking a short hike {{from the top of the}} Ranfoilly lift. the latter has been rated as one of the best off-piste powder bowls in Europe (although there is very often a medium chance of avalanches).|$|E
50|$|The annual {{snowfall}} of Mt Baldy {{is highly}} variable, {{as is the}} case across the southern California mountains. In some seasons there is insufficient natural snow to operate the ski area {{for more than a few}} days (if at all). In other seasons, (particularly certain El Niño years), several feet of snow can accumulate and provide for good daily operation of the ski area and widespread <b>off-piste</b> <b>skiing.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the winter, {{cross-country}} skiing {{is the only}} possible way to reach the mountain. Here you may choose a longer route, 25 km, starting at Hodalen, a local, rural and cottage community. It is recommended though to go skiing here {{in the latter part}} of the winter season, due to problems with large amounts of snow in the area, making cross-country more difficult in unprepared terrain. Its steep pyramid shape makes Elgpiggen a perfect destination for <b>off-piste</b> <b>skiing.</b>|$|E
50|$|Sainte-Foy-Tarentaise is {{a village}} in the Tarentaise Valley in Savoie, France. The old village lies {{on the main road}} between Bourg-Saint-Maurice and Val-d'Isère. About 4 km above the village (turning left at La Thuile) is the ski resort of Sainte Foy (referred as Sainte Foy Station). It is a small resort with four chairlifts, 15 slopes and {{accommodation}} for 2,500 people. Sainte Foy has groomed pistes which are often very quiet, but it is more famous for the <b>off-piste</b> <b>skiing</b> and snowboarding.|$|E
50|$|Yellow, orange square, red diamond: In recent years, many resorts {{reclassified}} {{some black}} slopes to yellow slopes. This signifies a skiroute or itineraire, an ungroomed and unpatrolled slope {{which is actually}} <b>off-piste</b> <b>skiing</b> in a marked area. Famous examples are the Stockhorn area in Zermatt and the Tortin slopes in Verbier. In Austria, skiroutes are usually marked with orange squares instead. It is also common to mark those pistes with a red diamond or a red diamond with black edges (the latter being more difficult).|$|E
50|$|Sugarbush Resort is a {{ski resort}} {{located in the}} Mad River valley in Warren, Vermont. It {{is one of the}} largest ski resorts in New England. The resort {{encompasses}} more than 4000 acres (16 km²) total, 578 trail acres (2.34 km²) skiable, 53 miles (85 km) of trails, and 16 ski lifts. Sugarbush has 111 ski trails, 18 additional marked wooded area, substantial <b>off-piste</b> <b>skiing</b> and riding, a summit elevation of 4083 ft, and a vertical drop of 2600 ft, second largest in Vermont after Killington, and the third largest in New England after Killington and Sugarloaf.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the term}} “freeriding” {{originated}} in snowboarding, some skiers have adopted it in recent years. For many years, the skiing equivalent of freeriding {{was known as}} freeskiing and referred specifically to <b>off-piste</b> <b>skiing.</b> However over the years, especially since the arrival of snowboarding, the term [...] "freeskiing" [...] has come to refer to freestyle skiing. This has left traditional “freeskiers” without a name for their style of skiing, and so some now use the snowboarding term instead. This became somewhat official in 2013, when the “Freeride World Tour” absorbed the “Freeskiing World Tour” into its schedule of competitive events.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{approximately}} 180 km of ski slopes (almost all equipped with snow-making), {{from the most}} simple to the more technical (19 blue runs, 41 red runs and 6 black runs, including, in Gressoney-Saint-Jean, {{the most difficult of}} the whole Aosta Valley), and 38 lifts that start at a minimum altitude of 1212 m above sea level (Alagna) and reach up to 3275 m s.l.m. at Indren Peak. The overall uplift capacity of the lift system is about 50,000 people per hour. The Valsesia part of the district is known for its many <b>off-piste</b> <b>skiing</b> and ski mountaineering.|$|E
50|$|The Pissaillas Glacier offers summer skiing, {{as well as}} {{the usual}} winter fare. Snow cannon are placed on certain slopes to {{accommodate}} heavy skiing. The ski slopes themselves are equipped with a high-volume gondola, able to transport standing skiers, the funicular Funival from La Daille via a tunnel to the top of Bellevarde, traditional chair lifts—some with windshields and many detachable, button/disc-pulls and tow-ropes. There are both groomed slopes and backcountry (<b>off-piste)</b> <b>skiing.</b> The slopes' difficulty levels are particularly high. However, as in Tignes there are wide, easily navigable pistes for those of the beginner-intermediate level as well. Its extensive off-piste facilities include guides for safety reasons; reviews are generally favourable.|$|E
5000|$|Any skiing {{outside the}} {{prepared}} or marked trails {{is referred to}} as backcountry or <b>off-piste</b> <b>skiing.</b> This form of skiing is probably the most mortally dangerous (depending on where and how you do it) because of the high speeds, large drops (sometimes with hidden rocks in the landing), and avalanches. This type of skiing has been banned in certain areas of the world because of chances of injury and/or death Many see this form of skiing to be the most freeing, because it creates a relationship of just the skier and mountain. Backcountry skiers consist of both newschool skiers who perform tricks off various terrain features, and oldschoolers as well ...|$|E
5000|$|Alagna Valsesia (Walser German: Im Land, Piedmontese: Alagna, Valsesiano: Lagna) is a comune {{and small}} village {{high in the}} Valsesia alpine valley in the {{province}} of Vercelli, Piedmont, Italy, a UNESCO World heritage site since 2013. It is a tourist place for mountaineering and winter sports, and it is internationally renowned for the freeride <b>off-piste</b> <b>skiing.</b> It was originally settled by Walser at the beginning of 12th century. It is located at an elevation of 1191 m just south of the Monte Rosa, elevation 4638 m (the second tallest peak in the Alps); It is very close to Milan (130 km) and to the international Milan-Malpensa Airport (106 km).|$|E
50|$|In the winter, {{skiing and}} snowboarding are Nelson's primary outdoor activities. Thirty minutes {{south of town}} is the Whitewater Ski Resort, which {{provides}} access, (via one triple chairlift, two double chairlifts and a handle tow), to 396 vertical metres of beginner to advanced terrain. The resort also provides access to hundreds of kilometres of <b>off-piste</b> <b>skiing</b> and back country touring. The Nelson area is home to over 20 cat-skiing, heli-skiing and ski-touring operators, and hundreds of kilometres of cross-country trails are available for the Nordic skier. In 2012 Nelson and Rossland, a small city south-west of Nelson, were jointly voted best ski locales in North America by readers of California-based Powder Magazine.|$|E
50|$|Las Leñas {{is one of}} {{the largest}} Andean ski resorts in Argentina, located in the western part of Mendoza Province, {{together}} with Cerro Catedral in San Carlos de Bariloche, Rio Negro province.It is well known for its powder snow, good climate and excellent opportunities for extreme and <b>off-piste</b> <b>skiing.</b> Construction of the ski center began January 1983, and by July 1983, it opened with a 300 bed hotel. The ski area has a good diversity of slopes ranging from very easy to extreme, including a good range of off-piste areas apt for extreme skiing. The skiable area base starts at an altitude of 2,240 m above mean sea level (7,350 feet) and goes up to 3430 m for a total drop of 1190 m. The skiable surface amounts to 2.3 km2, with 27 runs and a maximum non-stop skiable distance of 7 km (not including off run alternatives). The total ski area reachable by land is the largest in South America. It currently houses Piscis Hotel, the highest casino by elevation in the world.|$|E
