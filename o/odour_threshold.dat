Even though these compounds are widespread in nature no comprehensive information about their chemo-analytical as well as odour properties is available. Therefore, the objective of this study were (1) to provide systematic chemo-analytical data on these substances, such as mass spectral data and retention parameters in gas chromatographic analysis, and (2) to determine, on a direct comparative basis, the sensory properties of eight mono-halogenated phenols, four di-halogenated phenols and four halogenated cresols.

The winemaking process was followed during 4 weeks, being registered the amounts of grapes received, the fermentation temperatures, the time at which fermentation was stopped and evolution of must densities until the fortification time. The characterization of musts and wines was done in terms of density, total and volatile acidity, alcohol content, pH, total of polyphenol, organic acids composition, sugars concentration and the volatile profile. Also, it was developed and validated an analytical methodology to quantify the volatile fatty acids, namely using SPME-GC-MS.

However, the content of non-anthocyanin phenolics was significantly higher in the wines treated with antimicrobial extracts, especially for flavonols, being the dose-over-taste factor for these wines significantly higher. Finally, principal component analysis showed that wines were mainly differentiated on the basis of whether MLF was conducted or not, and its method of performance (inoculated/spontaneous).

30|$|Flavor {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} attributes that decides acceptability of food items that one consumes. The sensation of flavor perceived is usually because of a mixture of many compounds in the food. Nevertheless, some of them dominate the flavor of a particular food item and thus, are themselves capable of eliciting the flavor response in humans similar to that induced by food material. Furanones, which are found in some food products, represent one such dominating class of flavor compounds. In processed food, these compounds are formed as sugar degradation products by Maillard reaction induced by heat treatments (Schwab and Roscher 1997). Furanones are also important as naturally occurring flavor compounds. They are found in many fruits including strawberry, pineapple, raspberry, grapes, tomato, kiwi and mango and many contribute caramel-like flavor notes of these fruits (Schwab and Roscher 1997). In addition to having a sweet and pleasant odour, furanones, especially furaneol and mesifuran, are characterized by a low <b>odour</b> detection <b>threshold</b> (Pino and Mesa 2006). Our previous studies demonstrated that ripe mango fruits contain high amounts of furaneol (4 -hydroxy- 2, 5 -dimethyl- 3 (2 H)-furanone) and its methyl ether, mesifuran (2, 5 -dimethyl- 4 -methoxy- 3 (2 H)-furanone). The fruits of cultivar Alphonso contained higher amounts of these two compounds than those found in any other cultivar (Pandit et al. 2009 a), and ripening of Alphonso fruits was characterized by de novo appearance and increase in the level of these furanones (Pandit et al. 2009 b). Although furanones are not the most dominant compounds of the Alphonso fruits quantitatively, the low <b>odour</b> detection <b>threshold</b> of furanones makes their contribution to Alphonso mango flavor, about 20 -fold higher than that of any other volatile compound, in terms of odour units (Kulkarni et al. 2012).|$|R

In addition to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), other BFRs such as bromophenols, intermediates in FR formulation like bromoanilines, and their brominated and non-brominated by-products such as bromoanisoles, bromotoluenes, bromoalkanes and 1, 5, 9 -cyclododecatriene, respectively should be monitored and controlled {{because of their}} toxicity and their very low <b>odour</b> and taste <b>thresholds,</b> below sub-nanogram-per liter levels. In the present study several analytical methods for the simultaneous determination, i. e., combining one single sample treatment and one analysis step, of these compounds in water have been developed, optimized and evaluated. The methods involve a (pre-concentration) -extraction technique, such as liquid-liquid (LLE), solid-phase (SPE), headspace (HS) extraction or solid-phase microextraction (SPME), followed by gas chromatography (GC) -mass spectrometry (MS) analysis with either electron capture negative ionization (ECNI) or electron impact (EI) as ionization techniques. ECNI is more sensitive than EI for analytes {{with more than one}} bromine atom. HS and SPME were previously optimized by means of a multifactorial experimental design. Extraction temperature and the liquid/headspace volume ratio were the most significant factors in HS extraction. In SPME, the variables studied were the nature of the fiber, the mode of extraction and the extraction temperature. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) fibers appeared to be more suitable than carboxen-polydimethylsiloxane (CAR-PDMS) for the analysis of the target compounds with more than one bromine atom. The extraction of 2, 4 -dibromoaniline was only achieved in a direct immersion mode, in which the optimal extraction temperature was 60 °C. The methods LLE-GC-(ECNI) MS, LLE-GC-(EI) MS, SPE-GC-(ECNI) MS, SPE-GC-(EI) MS, HS-GC-(EI) MS and SPME-GC-(EI) MS were evaluated in terms of linearity, precision, detection limits and trueness. All methods, with the exception of HS-GC-(EI) MS, were linear in a range of at least two orders of magnitude, giving recoveries above 75 % and detection limits at the low ng/L level for most of the target analytes. SPE-GC-(ECNI) MS is the most sensitive and reliable method for the determination of most of the bromine compounds, whereas SPE-GC-(EI) MS is the most suitable to quantify the three isomers of 1, 5, 9 -cyclododecatriene.

In addition, we observed a far greater rate of past episodes of brief unconsciousness in the OH group. Conclusions. The presence of habituation deficits and past episodes of brief unconsciousness, and absence of olfactory affective impairment, have not been identified before as correlates of OHs, suggesting these factors may be worthy of further investigation. 19 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of three manure pit additives in commercial scale manure channels and simulated outdoor storage. The additives were American BioCatalysts (ABC), Pit Boss (PB) and Westbridge (WB). Results from two sets of indoor trials were combined to provide eight replicates of each additive. The protocol consisted of manure accumulation, pretreatment and treatment. Air and slurry samples were taken on Days 28 and 35 of the treatment phase. The outdoor phase that followed determined if residual effects resulting from indoor treatment existed. Manure was transferred from the manure channels to outdoor storage lagoons where it was stored in simulated lagoons. Samples were taken on Days 49 and 63. In terms of <b>odour</b> <b>threshold</b> reduction, the additives' effectiveness varied from producing no reduction to reductions of 66 %. The 66 % reduction produced by PB in the outdoor trial was the only significant <b>odour</b> <b>threshold</b> reduction in the experiment. During indoor storage, the additives produced minor <b>odour</b> <b>threshold</b> reductions. The additives were able to promote H 2 S reductions of 14 to 76 % and consistent yet minor NH 3 reductions in the indoor trials. None of the additives produced practical reductions in Total Solids or solubilization that could have improved manure-handling ease. Perhaps the strongest attribute of all of the additives was the ability to maintain elevated nutrients and micronutrient levels. Higher levels of TKN were maintained by all of the additives and the ability of the additives to maintain nitrogen in the available form, especially on Day 35 representing a potential of 9 to 25 % more available nitrogen during field application. Likewise, the additives resulted in 4 to 23 % more P while promoting elevated ortho-phosphate levels during the indoor trial. Improvements in nutrient value were also observed in potassium, copper and zinc results. Only with respect to waste strength reduction was the effectiveness of the additives relatively poor. In order to make more progress in the field of manure pit treatment, research must be directed towards understanding the modes of action of manure pit additives. With this information, optimization of their performance would lead to better results. Note:Page 81 is missing...|$|E
40|$|In {{different}} kinds of samples (odour sources) abt. 60 cabin air components with intense odour were identified. We determined <b>odour</b> <b>threshold</b> values for these components or refer to values we found in literature. From this list 15 substances had been chosen as 'critical odorous substances' in cabin air. When filtrating odour by gas filtration, we expect for these substances odour breakthrough due to short-time peaks in the cabin airSIGLEAvailable from TIB Hannover: F 99 B 1189 +a / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekBundesministerium fuer Wirtschaft, Bonn (Germany); Bundesministerium fuer Bildung und Forschung (BMBF), Bonn (Germany) DEGerman...|$|E
40|$|By {{means of}} steam {{distillation}} {{in combination with}} capillary gas chromatography and mass spectrometry many volatile compounds can be identified in unprinted paperboard. Depending on the ratio of their concentration and their specific <b>odour</b> <b>threshold</b> values, some of the volatile compounds contribute to odour intensity in paperboards. Examples are 2, 4 -decadienals, 2 -nonenal and 1 -octen- 3 -ol and the total range of aldehydes and short-chain fatty acids. The volatiles stem from auto-oxidation of unsaturated lipids, from resinous flavour, from mouldiness of wood or from fermentation processes within the water circuit. Paperboards with striking off odours reveal relatively high concentrations of volatile and odorous compounds...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a growing}} concern in the {{population}} in the Nordic countries regarding the health impact in connection with the releases of odour and bioaerosols as allergens and other compounds from the agricultural sector. Complaints from neighbours to livestock farm houses about odour are getting more and more common. All types of animal households may potentially lead to odour problems, thousands of different odour and bioaerosol compounds released from livestock farming have been identified. Other sources as bioaerosols from livestock has been identified as a potential source for childhood asthma and can cause health risk for farmers working in intensive livestock production units. Odour and gases related to agricultural activity are an international problem partly due to the intensification of concentrated animal production and partly due to the increasing urban population moving closer to farming and livestock production units. The aim of this report is to present a survey of the existing literature, models, available data regarding odour and allergens released from livestock farming and Nordic policy guidelines on <b>odour</b> annoyance <b>thresholds...</b>|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{experimental evidence}} that selection and addition of an appropriate type of Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC) and alternatively {{or in combination}} ozonation of the water can be very effective in removal of both geosmin and 2 -MIB from surface waters intended for supplying potable water. According to the experimental results, it was shown that the adsorptive capacity of the carbon is about five times greater {{in the case of}} geosmin when compared with 2 -MIB. Furthermore, addition of ozone at doses in the range 1 - 3 mg/L for a period of 5 - 10 min can reduce odour to levels below <b>threshold</b> <b>odour</b> value.

40|$|Odour {{control from}} pig {{production}} facilities {{is a significant}} concern due to increased public awareness {{and the development of}} more stringent legislation to control production. Although many technologies exist, biofiltration is still the most attractive due to its low maintenance and operating costs. One of the key odour components, n-butyric acid, was selected for a laboratory scale biofilter study. It was examined as a sole carbon substrate in order to investigate the effectiveness of biofiltration in reducing n-butyric acid concentration under different operating conditions using a moist enriched woodchip medium. Three superficial gas velocities; 38. 2, 76. 4, and 114. 6 m h− 1 were tested for n-butyric acid concentrations ranging from 0. 13 to 3. 1 g [n-butyric acid] m− 3 [air]. For superficial gas velocities 38. 2, 76. 4, and 114. 6 m h− 1, maximum elimination capacities (100 % removal) of 148, 113 and 34. 4 g m 3 h− 1, respectively, were achieved. Upon investigation of effective bed height, true elimination capacities (100 % removal) of 230, 233 and 103 g m− 3 h− 1, respectively, were achieved at these superficial gas velocities. Averaged pressure drops for superficial gas velocities 38. 2, 76. 4, and 114. 6 m h− 1 were 30, 78 and 120 Pa, respectively. It was concluded that biofiltration is a viable technology for the removal of n-butyric acid from waste exhaust air, but near 100 % removal efficiency is required due to the low <b>odour</b> detection <b>threshold</b> for this gaseous compound...|$|R
