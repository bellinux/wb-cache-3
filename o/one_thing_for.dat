5|$|Mr. Steinitz stands {{high as a}} {{theoretician}} and as a writer; he has {{a powerful}} pen, and when he chooses can use expressive English. He evidently strives {{to be fair to}} friends and foes alike, but appears sometimes to fail to see that after all he is much like many others in this respect. Possessed of a fine intellect, and extremely fond of the game, he is apt to lose sight of all other considerations, people and business alike.

5|$|Putnam has {{consistently}} {{adhered to the}} idea of semantic holism, in spite of the many changes in his other positions. The problems with this position have been described by Michael Dummett, Jerry Fodor, Ernest Lepore, and others. In the first place, they suggest that, if semantic holism is true, it is impossible to understand how a speaker of a language can learn the meaning of an expression, for any expression of the language. Given the limits of our cognitive abilities, we {{will never be able to}} master the whole of the English (or any other) language, even based on the (false) assumption that languages are static and immutable entities. Thus, if one must understand all of a natural language to understand a single word or expression, language learning is simply impossible. Semantic holism also fails to explain how two speakers can mean the same thing when using the same linguistic expression, and therefore how any communication at all is possible between them. Given a sentence P, since Fred and Mary have each mastered different parts of the English language and P is related in different ways to the sentences in each part, the result is that P means <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> Fred and something else for Mary. Moreover, if a sentence P derives its meaning from its relations with all of the sentences of a language, as soon as the vocabulary of an individual changes by the addition or elimination of a sentence, the totality of relations changes, and therefore also the meaning of P. As this is a common phenomenon, the result is that P has two different meanings in two different moments in the life of the same person. Consequently, if I accept the truth of a sentence and then reject it later on, the meaning of that which I rejected and that which I accepted are completely different and therefore I cannot change my opinions with regard to the same sentences.|$|E

They play upon these at their feasts, and carry them {{to the war in}} their boats instead of drums and other instruments.|$|E

500|$|When Lennon went to Hamburg {{again in}} April 1962, {{she found a}} bedsit in a terraced house at 93 Garmoyle Road, Liverpool. Shortly after having failed her art teacher's diploma exam, in August 1962, she found she was {{pregnant}} with Lennon's child. She later explained that she and Lennon had never used contraception, had never talked about it, and didn't think about it at the time. When she told Lennon he said, [...] "There's only <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> it Cyn, we'll have to get married".|$|E

500|$|Recalling his July 1962 {{reaction}} {{when he learned}} that Cynthia was pregnant, Lennon said, [...] "There's only <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> it Cyn. We'll have to get married." [...] The couple wed on 23 August at the Mount Pleasant Register Office in Liverpool. His marriage began just as Beatlemania took hold across the UK. He performed on the evening of his wedding day, and would continue to do so almost daily from then on. Epstein feared that fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle, and he asked the Lennons to keep their marriage secret. Julian was born on 8 April 1963; Lennon was on tour at the time and did not see his infant son until three days later.|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} Stieg Larsson's novel created Hollywood {{interest}} in adapting the book, as became apparent in 2009, when Lynton and Pascal pursued {{the idea of}} developing an [...] "American" [...] version unrelated to the Swedish film adaptation released that year. By December, two major developments occurred for the project: Steven Zaillian, who had recently completed the script for Moneyball (2011), became the screenwriter, while producer Scott Rudin finalized a partnership allocating full copyrights to Sony. Zaillian, who was unfamiliar with the novel, got a copy from Rudin. The screenwriter recalled, [...] "They sent {{it to me and}} said, 'We want to do this. [...] We will think of it as <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> now. It's possible that it can be two and three, but let's concentrate on this one.'" [...] After reading the book, the screenwriter did no research on the subject.|$|E

500|$|Producer Glen Morgan was {{disappointed}} with the resolution regarding the Crew Cut Man, saying [...] "My feeling is that to bring this guy back, his presence should have been better developed, and he's shot off screen.

The episode just seems like half of <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> a while, then half of something else.

500|$|Though {{the initial}} {{growth of the}} fandom {{may have come from}} 4chan {{participants}} enjoying the ironic nature of grown men enjoying a show for girls, the fandom continues to grow based on sincere appreciation of the work. Robert Thompson, a professor of media studies at Syracuse University, stated that [...] "It's <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> guys to like motorcycles and muscle cars and soccer. For a guy to like My Little Pony, it's so out there that it becomes almost avant garde. It has a hip quality to it." [...] According to Angela Watchcutter of Wired, the fandom is an example of internet neo-sincerity, where these older viewers watch the show [...] "un-ironically" [...] and [...] "without guilt" [...] breaking gender stereotypes, furthermore creating new material around it. Prof. Roberta Pearson of the University of Nottingham in film and television studies stated that [...] "This is a level of fan devotion I've not seen before," [...] while Prof. Charles Soukup of the University of Northern Colorado in communication studies suggested that this effort is an indication of the [...] "ultra-cult era" [...] that bronies exhibit, where [...] "media consumers discover extremely unexpected and obscure media texts to cultivate uniqueness and distinctiveness for their mediated identities".|$|E
500|$|Shortly after, the Parents Television Council (PTC) {{threatened}} to file indecency complaints with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) against any station that played the song between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. PTC President Tim Winter said [...] "there is no misinterpreting {{the lyrics to}} this song, and it's certainly not about a girl named Amy. It's <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> a song with these lyrics to be included on a CD so that fans who wish to hear it can do so, but it's an entirely different matter when this song is played over the publicly owned airwaves, especially {{at a time when}} children are likely to be in the listening audience." [...] RBR.com reported that [...] "interestingly, Circus was reviewed by Common Sense Media, another organization whose mission is to help parents manage their children's media consumption. It rated it appropriate for age 13 and up, but made no specific mention of 'If U Seek Amy'. Even more interestingly, reputed incoming FCC Chair Julius Genachowski is a founding board member of Common Sense."

2500|$|On November 9, 2015, Kristina Ruehli filed a {{defamation}} {{lawsuit against}} Cosby for denying her claims of rape. Ruehli's allegations against Cosby date back the furthest, with claims that Cosby assaulted her in 1965. She claims Cosby's vehement denials leveled against the numerous accusers in 2014 are grounds for defamation. Ruehli's complaint states, in part, [...] "It is <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> an accused sexual assailant {{to remain silent}} and allow the legal process, or public opinion, to run its course, but it is quite another for him to unleash his agents to deny that he attacked the plaintiff and other women, to invite others to republish his statements, and to brand them as unreliable liars."

2500|$|Sacchetti's version differs: [...] "When I {{proposed}} to Lucio my original treatment for Per Sempre, which {{was nothing more}} than a sequel to The Postman Always Rings Twice in which a dead man returns to life, he became really enthusiastic and had my story read by a producer friend of his who then commissioned me to write a finished script. At that time, Fulci assumed that he would direct it. Later, for various reasons, problems arose and the film was never made. Four years later, (Lamberto) Bava used my script to make Per Sempre and Fulci, who was not working much at the time, got angry with me and started hurling these accusations. It's <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> him to say that we were originally supposed to make the film together, but to claim that he originated the story and that I stole it from him is pure science fiction".|$|E
2500|$|To permit Lee's suit, Gray argued, {{would open}} the United States to a {{multitude}} of suits over title to land it held. The cases cited by the majority (such as United States v. Peters, Osborn v. Bank of United States, Meigs v. M'Clung, and Davis v. Gray) were improperly cited, Gray argued, as in each case [...] "either the money was in the personal possession of the defendants {{and not in the}} possession of the State, or the suit was to restrain the defendants by injunction from doing acts in violation of the Constitution of the United States." [...] It was <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> the Court to eject or dispossess officers or agents of the United States from land or funds; such actions, Gray concluded, continued to immunize the United States government from suits. Carr v. United States reaffirmed this principle, he concluded. To blur the distinction between officer and state or to assume or imply it without the state's consent, as the majority does, Gray said, would leave the sovereign immunity right in shambles.|$|E
