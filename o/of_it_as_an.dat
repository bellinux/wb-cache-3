5|$|Long epic poetry was not {{a popular}} genre in North Korea before Mt. Paektu, {{but it was in}} the Soviet Union where Cho had immigrated from. Poema and Mayakovsky's prosody and poetry were also among Cho's {{influences}} that can be seen in Mt. Paektu. These Russian stylistic influences gave Mt. Paektu its peculiar characteristics that prompted mixed reactions from the North Korean public. For instance, some in the literature circles were unfamiliar with the concept of a lyrical epic and thought <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> improbable amalgam of genres, criticizing the work for being indistinguishable from ordinary prose. According to North Korean studies scholar Alzo David-West, the relatively favorable reaction to Mt. Paektu compared to some other literature testifies to North Korean readership being capable at being both a receptive and a dismissive audience.|$|E

25|$|Gramsci {{stated that}} bourgeois {{cultural}} values {{were tied to}} folklore, popular culture and religion, and therefore much of his analysis of hegemonic culture is aimed at these. He was also impressed by the influence Roman Catholicism had and the care the Church had taken to prevent an excessive gap developing between {{the religion of the}} learned and that of the less educated. Gramsci saw Marxism as a marriage of the purely intellectual critique of religion found in Renaissance humanism and the elements of the Reformation that had appealed to the masses. For Gramsci, Marxism could supersede religion only if it met people's spiritual needs, and to do so people would have to think <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> expression of their own experience.|$|E

500|$|After his {{conversion}} in 1821, Presbyterian minister and revivalist Charles Grandison Finney experienced {{what he called}} [...] "baptism in the Holy Spirit" [...] accompanied by [...] "unutterable gushings" [...] of praise. Finney and other Reformed writers, known as Oberlin perfectionists, agreed {{that there was a}} life altering experience after conversion, but unlike their Wesleyan holiness counterparts, they conceived <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> ongoing process enabling believers to devote themselves wholly to Christ's service. Similarly, the English Higher Life movement taught that the second blessing was an [...] "enduement of power". According to this view, Spirit baptism gave Christians the ability to be witnesses for the gospel and to perform Christian service.

500|$|Reeves dislikes remakes, but was {{impressed}} by the script, which he deemed a reimagining. He enjoyed the original film as a child and became fonder <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> adult when he understood how relevant it was, but prefers this version because it lacked the contradictory message of Klaatu [...] "laying down the law [...] almost as though the alien had the bigger stick." [...] Reeves acknowledged his Klaatu is [...] "inverted" [...] from the original, starting [...] "sinister and tough" [...] but becoming [...] "more human," [...] whereas the original was [...] "more human than human" [...] before revealing his [...] "big stick" [...] in his ending speech. He compared the remake's Klaatu to the wrathful God who floods the world in the Old Testament, but is gentle and forgiving {{by the time of the}} New Testament. He spent many weeks revising the script, trying to make Klaatu's transition from alien in human form to one who appreciates their emotions and beliefs subtle and nuanced. Derrickson, the director, said that although Reeves would not use actions [...] "that are highly unusual or highly quirky", he nevertheless [...] "keeps you aware of the fact that this being you're walking through this movie with is not a human being." [...] At Reeves' insistence, the classic line [...] "Klaatu barada nikto" [...] was added to the script after initially being omitted. The line was recorded many times, and it was decided to combine two recordings: one where Reeves said it normally, and a reversed version where he said the line backwards, creating an [...] "alien" [...] effect.|$|E
