5|$|Common to all {{crimes against}} {{the person is}} the {{infringement}} {{of the right to}} bodily integrity. It extends to the touching of clothing, for example, and where no physical harm actually results. However, if all touchings were criminalised, this would interfere with the right to liberty. It is the very touching, and not the harm, that is the violation <b>of</b> <b>principle.</b> This is related to the right to privacy under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The central statute on this topic is Offences against the Person Act 1861, which brought together a multitude of difference offences, with much overlap and inconsistent terminology. These include both the actual infliction and the threat of violence. Although criticised, the Act has not been replaced.|$|E

40|$|This thesis, called "Environmental {{principles}} and their application in international, EU and czech law", discusses {{the nature and}} application <b>of</b> the <b>principles</b> in the law generally, namely in international law, law of the European union and czech law. The {{first part of this}} thesis deals with the legally-theoretical definitions, the nature and basic characteristics and attributes <b>of</b> <b>principles.</b> The next chapters describes concrete environmental {{principles and}} their functions and occurrence in the law. Author attempts to show (through analysis of concrete normative documents a texts) the usage and application <b>of</b> <b>principles</b> in legal praxis. The importance <b>of</b> the <b>principles</b> is also emphasized {{from the point of view}} of concrete judicial cases, in which principles have been explicitly mentioned. Author mainly focuses on the following principles (see 3 rd chapter, which represents the crucial part of the thesis) : <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> the highest value, <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> the common interest <b>of</b> mankind, <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> the right to favourable environment, <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> the sustainable environment, <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> the participation of the public and <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> information, <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> prevention, precautionary <b>principle,</b> <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> the responsibility and <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> integration and <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> protection complexity...|$|R

5|$|In 1851, the Liberals gained {{office on}} Prince Edward Island. They {{immediately}} went about putting in place measures to gradually dismantle the proprietor/tenant system, although their efforts generally had limited effect largely because Samuel Cunard, who owned one-sixth of the Island, refused to sell {{any of his}} land. In 1864, the tenants organised into the Tenant League, and vowed to resist the collection of rent by their proprietors. Efforts by law enforcement to quell this rebellion had little effect, so {{the government of the}} island requested the assistance of British troops to enforce the collection of rent. In 1865, British troops arrived in the colony and successfully enforced the collection of the unpaid rent, and the Tenant League crumbled. It appeared that the operation of the Tenant League was a matter <b>of</b> <b>principle</b> rather than practical necessity; the rent paid by tenants to the proprietors was to the amount of one shilling per acre, and the proprietors allowed rent to go unpaid for years at a time.|$|E

5|$|Regardless {{of whether}} Pope Pius IX had been {{personally}} {{involved in the}} decision to remove Mortara from his parents—whether he had been or not was debated extensively in the press—what is certain is that he was greatly surprised by the international furore that erupted over the matter, and promptly adopted the position that to return the baptised child to his non-Christian family would be totally incompatible with Church doctrine. As foreign governments and the various branches of the Rothschild family one by one condemned his actions, Pius IX stood firm on what he saw as a matter <b>of</b> <b>principle.</b> Those angered included Emperor Napoleon III of France, who found the situation particularly vexing as the pontifical government owed its very existence to the French garrison in Rome. Napoleon III had indifferently supported the Pope's temporal rule because it enjoyed widespread support among French Catholics; the scandal over Mortara weakened this considerably and, according to the historian Roger Aubert, provided the final straw that changed French policy. In February 1859 Napoleon III concluded a secret pact with the Kingdom of Sardinia pledging French military support for a campaign to drive the Austrians out and unify Italy—most of the pontifical domain would be absorbed along with the Two Sicilies and other minor states.|$|E
5|$|Stephen's brother, Henry of Blois, {{was alarmed}} by this, {{both as a}} matter <b>of</b> <b>principle,</b> since Stephen had {{previously}} agreed in 1135 to respect the freedoms of the church, and more pragmatically because he himself had recently built six castles and {{had no desire to}} be treated in the same way. As the papal legate, he summoned the King to appear before an ecclesiastical council to answer for the arrests and seizure of property. Henry asserted the Church's right to investigate and judge all charges against members of the clergy. Stephen sent Aubrey de Vere as his spokesman to the council, who argued that Roger of Salisbury had been arrested not as a bishop, but rather in his role as a baron who had been preparing to change his support to the Empress Matilda. The King was supported by Hugh, Archbishop of Rouen, who challenged the bishops to show how canon law entitled them to build or hold castles. Aubrey threatened that Stephen would complain to the pope that he was being harassed by the English church, and the council let the matter rest following an unsuccessful appeal to Rome. The incident successfully removed any military threat from the bishops, but it may have damaged Stephen's relationship with the senior clergy, and in particular with his brother Henry.|$|E

40|$|Principles play an {{important}} role in Information Management (IM); this can be seen from the different principle-based IM standards, such as ISO/IEC 38500 for IT Governance. Also, in the various definitions of Enterprise Architecture (EA), principles are regarded as a pivotal element. However, despite advances in the definition and usage <b>of</b> <b>principles,</b> the EA discipline still suffers from some fundamental limitations, such as the lack of guidelines for developing a generic set <b>of</b> <b>principles</b> and a theoretical basis for developing them. Assuming enterprises as viable systems, this research aims to suggest a set <b>of</b> design <b>principles</b> based on the concepts of cybernetics, especially those embedded in the Viable System Model (VSM). Stafford Beer formulated the VSM as a blueprint for designing organisations that are able to survive and thrive in a changing environment. The concepts of the VSM can be used for designing viable organisations, and hence also be used as methods for developing EA <b>principles.</b> The structure <b>of</b> this thesis is established on the Design Science Research methodology, which is generally based on the iterative âbuildâ and âevaluateâ processes. Following the steps of this methodology and after the initial phases of determining the problem and objective, a set <b>of</b> VSM-based design <b>principles</b> is developed to be used as methods, in the form of guidelines, in proposing comprehensive principles, or in checking the coherency of a set <b>of</b> <b>principles.</b> As for the evaluation step, the artefact is evaluated by mapping against an existing set <b>of</b> <b>principles,</b> generating a set <b>of</b> <b>principles</b> for an Australian government department, checking the comprehensiveness of the set <b>of</b> <b>principles</b> in another Australian agency, and finally proposing a set <b>of</b> <b>principles</b> for the IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) as a non-EA application. All of these works are validated by professionals in different ways. The contributions made by this research include: using cybernetic concepts to generate a set <b>of</b> <b>principles</b> and to check the coherency of existing sets <b>of</b> <b>principles,</b> improving EA by the new definition and application <b>of</b> <b>principles,</b> and proposing a set <b>of</b> <b>principles</b> for ITIL. These outcomes are published as some conference and journal papers...|$|R

Conclusions and directions of further researches. Research of theoretical and methodological aspects of marketing pricing forming enables to systematize existent pricing principles. The analysed principles are the basis of pricing policy. Within marketing activity in the sphere of pricing it is necessary to adhere principles mentioned above.
