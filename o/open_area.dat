5|$|The Yoyogi National Gymnasium is {{situated}} in an <b>open</b> <b>area</b> in Yoyogi Park on an adjacent axis to the Meiji Shrine. The gymnasium and swimming pool were designed by Tange for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, which were the first Olympics held in Asia. Tange began his designs in 1961 and the plans were approved by the Ministry of Education in January 1963. The buildings were placed to optimize space available for parking and to permit the smoothest transition of incoming and outgoing people.|$|E

5|$|After being marched {{two miles}} north-west {{of the city}} centre, the victims {{encountered}} a barbed wire barrier and numerous Ukrainian police and German troops. Thirty or forty people at a time were told to leave their possessions and were escorted through a narrow passageway lined with soldiers brandishing clubs. Anyone who tried to escape was beaten. Soon the victims reached an <b>open</b> <b>area,</b> where {{they were forced to}} strip, and then were herded down into the ravine. People were forced to lie down in rows on top of the bodies of other victims, and they were shot {{in the back of the}} head or the neck by members of the execution squads.|$|E
5|$|Architecturally, smaller churches {{will feature}} bright lighting, large windows, a simple {{platform}} with a pulpit in the center, and an altar ("a bench {{across the front}} of the church below the platform"). Larger churches will have direct access from the balcony to the main sanctuary near the platform so that respondents to altar calls can easily come forward, a large <b>open</b> <b>area</b> in front of the platform to accommodate altar call gatherings, and the platform itself is usually large to accommodate a large choir and musical instruments. Because the Assemblies of God practice baptism by immersion, many churches will include a baptistry {{at the rear of the}} platform.|$|E
5|$|In Kingsbury, US4 and NY149 {{head through}} an <b>open</b> <b>area</b> dotted with farms and ponds. The routes proceed southward to a {{junction}} known as Baldwin Corner, where US4 and NY149 split. While US4 {{heads to the}} southeast, NY149 continues due south, paralleling the Champlain Canal to an area known as Smith's Basin. Here, NY149 turns east and crosses both a railroad line and the canal—which NY149 had been following since joining US4 in downtown Fort Ann—to enter the town of Hartford. Here, the route winds its way eastward through a rural, mostly undeveloped area of Washington County as it intersects several county roads {{on its way to}} the hamlet of Hartford.|$|E

5|$|NY31E {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY31 {{in the village}} of Middleport in eastern Niagara County. The route heads north as Main Street, overlapping with NY271 (which also begins at NY31) through the mostly residential village. Just south of the Erie Canal, NY31E and NY271 enter Middleport's small business district, centered on the junction of Main and State Streets. Here, NY31E and NY271 split, with NY31E following State Street eastward through the eastern portion of the community. Along this stretch, the route serves Royalton–Hartland High School and Royalton-Hartland Middle School before exiting Middleport and entering a slightly more <b>open</b> <b>area</b> of the town of Royalton. NY31E runs past undeveloped land to the north and a smattering of homes to the south on its way into the Orleans County town of Shelby New York|Ridgeway]].|$|E
5|$|NY335 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with Feura Bush Road {{southeast of the}} hamlet of Delmar {{in the town of}} Bethlehem. Although Feura Bush Road is now NY910A, an unsigned reference route, it was once part of NY32. From Feura Bush Road, NY335 heads northward as a two-lane street named Elsmere Avenue, passing several housing tracts in an otherwise <b>open</b> <b>area</b> of the town. After a half-mile (0.8km), the route meets the Delmar Bypass, a four-lane divided highway carrying NY32 through Bethlehem. Past the bypass, NY335 traverses dense residential neighborhoods {{on its way to the}} hamlet of Elsmere, one of several communities located along NY443.|$|E
5|$|Now {{fully in}} the town of Lockport, NY31 and NY93 proceed {{northeast}} through an <b>open</b> <b>area</b> of the town as a four-lane divided highway. The two routes continue to {{the western edge of the}} city of Lockport, where they intersect with Upper Mountain Road and the Lockport Bypass. The overlap ends here as NY93 turns southeastward onto the two-lane bypass. Along the bypass, NY93 briefly enters the city limits as it runs past several industrial facilities and intersects with Hinman Road (CR903) just ahead of a bridge over the Erie Canal. Past the waterway, the bypass takes a more southerly course through an undeveloped part of the town of Lockport to a junction with Robinson Road (CR123) on the Lockport–Pendleton town line. The Lockport Bypass ends here, leaving NY93 to turn eastward onto Robinson Road.|$|E

5|$|The British {{arrival in}} Jerusalem heralded a {{rational}} philosophy of infrastructure planning and development. It respected cultural and historic heritage {{and attempted to}} preserve such elements within the blossoming construction of the modern city. The city walls were identified as such an element, so British workers acted to clear away the stalls on their perimeter and maintain an <b>open</b> <b>area</b> between {{the walls and the}} rest of the New City in the interest of an aesthetically pleasing visual basin. By the same token, planners demolished the Ottoman clock tower to preserve a historic skyline.|$|E
5|$|The {{field of}} the stadium {{combines}} a number of elements {{for use in the}} jumping and throwing events. The long jump and triple jump areas comprise a straight, narrow 40-metre running track with a sandpit at one or both ends. Jumps are measured from a take off board—typically a small strip of wood with a plasticine marker attached—which ensures athletes jump from behind the measurement line. The pole vault area is also a 40-metre running track and has an indentation in the ground (the box) where vaulters plant their poles to propel themselves over a crossbar before falling onto cushioned landing mats. The high jump is a stripped down version of this, with an <b>open</b> <b>area</b> of track or field that leads to a crossbar with a square area of landing mats behind it.|$|E
5|$|VT149 heads southeastward {{away from}} the built up village of Granville into a more rural region of the Rutland County town of Pawlet, {{paralleling}} the Mettawee River as it progresses onward. It heads past homes and through a dense forest as it intersects with Bull Frog Hollow Road just after the border. After Bull Frog Hollow Road, the route proceeds eastward through an area dominated by quarries. VT149 continues on, entering a more <b>open</b> <b>area</b> and passing only a few homes before ending at an intersection with VT30 in Blossom Corners, a small, largely unpopulated community within the town of Pawlet.|$|E

5|$|From {{an early}} age, Hobbs played cricket {{whenever}} he could. His first games were {{played in the}} streets near his house. He was educated at a primary school affiliated with his local Anglican church, St Matthew's, and moved in 1891 to York Street Boys' School, a fee-paying establishment; Hobbs later admitted to being a poor scholar but was successful at sports. He played cricket regularly for the St Matthew's choir team and the York Street school team, and during holidays helped his father at Jesus College. In his final year at York Street, to supplement the family budget, Hobbs took a job working before school hours in the domestic service of a private house. On leaving school in 1895, he worked as an errand boy until his father's connections at the university secured him a summer job as a college servant, chiefly assisting the cricket team. Aged 16, Hobbs became an apprentice gas fitter, and practised cricket on Parker's Piece, an <b>open</b> <b>area</b> of common land in Cambridge, in his spare time. He played for various local clubs but did not initially stand out as a cricketer: although better than most other Cambridge batsmen, no coaches or major teams approached him, and his batting gave little indication of the success which came later.|$|E
5|$|NY15A {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY15 {{in the town}} of Springwater hamlet of the same name, also officially known as Springwater Hamlet, located {{on the east side of}} a large valley in southeastern Livingston County. The route heads northward as North Main Street, proceeding along the eastern base of the valley as it passes through the northern half of the community. Outside of the hamlet, NY15A enters a rural, undeveloped area dominated by dense forests to the east and a low-lying, slightly more <b>open</b> <b>area</b> to the west. As the route approaches the Livingston–Ontario county line, the lowlands give way to marshes, which in turn lead to Hemlock Lake at the county line. While in Ontario County {{in the town of}} Canadice, NY15A follows a more inland route to the east, passing through an isolated forest situated between Hemlock and Canadice Lakes. After , the highway reenters Livingston County near the northern end of Hemlock Lake.|$|E
