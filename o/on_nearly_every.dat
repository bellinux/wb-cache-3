5|$|All artwork for {{the album}} was {{selected}} from a contest held by DeviantArt. The contestants were asked to design {{a new version of}} Vic Rattlehead, the band mascot which appears <b>on</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>every</b> Megadeth album cover. Mustaine chose from the top 11 finalists {{to be included in the}} CD booklet. The cover was unveiled in August 2006, of which the image depicts the United Nations headquarters in flames and being destroyed by flying oil barrels. Vic Rattlehead (the Megadeth mascot) and the 'Angel of Deth' are pictured in the foreground. Although the cover of the CD was not the winner of the contest, Mustaine chose it as his favorite picture, and wanted it for the cover. No photographs of the band were taken for the CD booklet, leaving the entire design as fan-made artwork.|$|E

5000|$|Saturday {{night is}} also a popular time slot for comedy shows on television. The most famous of these is Saturday Night Live, a skit show that has aired <b>on</b> NBC <b>nearly</b> <b>every</b> week since 1975.

25|$|As {{it turned}} out, KMSP's {{transition}} into an independent station {{turned out to}} be a blessing in disguise. It was far more successful than the station ever had been as an ABC affiliate. It became a regional superstation, available <b>on</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>every</b> cable system in Minnesota as well as large portions of North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa and Wisconsin. Over time, it became one of the most successful and profitable independent stations in the country.|$|E
25|$|Built {{in typical}} Tibetan {{architecture}} style with Chinese and Indian influences, the monastery reflects a deeply Buddhist approach.

Tibetan art, a form of sacred art, {{in the form of the}} exquisitely detailed statues to wooden carvings to the intricate designs of the Thangka paintings (a syncrestism of Chinese scroll-painting with Nepalese and Kashmiri painting) are seen in this monastery.|$|E
25|$|Legacy of Hopelessness showcased {{a bit of}} a {{departure}} for the band in that it had a lot more electronic influences. Keyboards are featured <b>on</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>every</b> track, and are sometimes the primary focus. Of course, grindcore is still quite present as well as Mel's distinctive vocals. The change in musical style can probably be attributed to this being initially intended to be a solo release by Topon, but was migrated over to the band when it was realized that another full-length release was not quite feasible.|$|E
5000|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common Chinese auspicious saying {{concerning}} longevity is that found <b>on</b> scrolls in <b>nearly</b> <b>every</b> Chinese calligraphy shop in the world: shòu shān fú hǎi (寿山福海), which can be translated as [...] "May your life be as steadfast as the mountains and your good fortune as limitless as the seas".|$|R
5000|$|Professor Hildebrand {{often said}} he most {{cherished}} {{his role as}} a teacher.

He came to his office <b>on</b> campus <b>nearly</b> <b>every</b> school day until declining health made it impossible.|$|R
50|$|Striking Ceylon as a super {{cyclonic}} storm, {{the storm}} wrought tremendous damage.

25|$|With {{the onset}} of the Great Depression in 1929, {{building}} in the area slowed, but in 1934, as the FHA made credit more available, construction again resumed, and another growth spurt in the neighborhood occurred in the late 1930s and early 1940s. By the 1950s, there was a house <b>on</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>every</b> lot in the neighborhood. In the later part of the century, as the population in Detroit declined, Rosedale Park has remained a desirable neighborhood due to its high grade housing stock, charming setting and active neighborhood association.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} Super Mario Bros. {{led to the}} {{development}} of many successors in the Super Mario series of video games, which in turn form the core of the greater Mario franchise. The gameplay concepts and elements established in Super Mario Bros. are prevalent in nearly every Super Mario game. The series consists of over 15 entries; at least one Super Mario game has been released <b>on</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>every</b> Nintendo console to date. The most recent release is Super Mario Odyssey, released in 2017 for the Nintendo Switch. The series is one of the best-selling, with over 310 million copies of games sold worldwide as of September 2015.|$|E
25|$|LMEMS {{partners}} {{with the various}} fire departments and fire protection districts {{in the metro area}} in a cooperative effort to further reduce the amount of time from when a person calls for assistance to the time assistance arrives. The American Heart Association recommends early defibrillation to be beneficial to an individual suffering cardiac arrest and as such most fire apparatus carry automated external defibrillators (AEDs) with trained EMTs to begin stabilizing the patient prior to EMS arrival. Each fire department or fire district is independent and as such have varying response guidelines. Some agencies respond to only the most serious calls while others will respond <b>on</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>every</b> call.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fourth and}} fifth volumes were only {{available}} for purchase through the now-defunct Adult Swim online store. The final six episodes of the television run have never had an official release <b>on</b> DVD. <b>Nearly</b> <b>every</b> episode was available to buy through a [...] "build your own DVD" [...] feature Adult Swim had on its website, thus the final season, early episodes that were left off of the first volume and unedited shows that had been altered on the official releases were now available to own.

5000|$|While {{remaining}} [...] "extraordinarily conservative", Scarborough {{became more}} critical of President George W. Bush {{and some of his}} policies before the show ended in 2007.

Her depictions of the terror after the fall of the city won her several major awards.|$|R
25|$|When Foster {{joined the}} Leland Giants, he demanded {{that he be}} {{put in charge of}} not only the on-field activities, but the bookings as well. Foster {{immediately}} turned the Giants into the team to beat. He indoctrinated them to take the extra base, to play hit and run <b>on</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>every</b> pitch, and to rattle the opposing pitcher by taking them deep into the count. He studied the mechanics of his pitchers and could spot the smallest flaw, turning his average pitchers into learned craftsmen. Foster also was able to turn around the business end of the team as well, by demanding and getting 40 percent of the gate instead of the 10 percent that Frank Leland was getting.|$|E
25|$|Although often grouped {{with the}} Edo Confucian scholar, Ogyū Sorai, as {{a proponent of}} the ancient {{learning}} movement, Jinsai's singlemost harsh critic {{was none other than}} Sorai. In a letter written to Jinsai, Sorai early on expressed admiration for the Kyoto philosopher and an interest in his philosophy, having read a pirated edition of Jinsai's Gomō jigi published long before Jinsai was ready for it to be released in its final form. Jinsai never responded to Sorai, apparently wounding his pride deeply. Whatever Sorai might have made of Jinsai's silence, it is clear that in Sorai's later writings, in the Bendō and Benmei (1728) in particular, Sorai takes issue with Jinsai <b>on</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>every</b> count, often criticizing him harshly as in effect no different in philosophical doctrine than the thinker he supposedly was criticizing, Zhu Xi.|$|E
25|$|Later, Keane had {{a change}} of heart. Keane along with Harry Redknapp and Gareth Southgate (who Keane was sent off for {{stamping}} on during an FA Cup semi-final in 1995) were pundits for ITV's coverage of the Champions League final between Manchester United and Barcelona. In the 2011–12 season, he became ITV chief football analyst, appearing <b>on</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>every</b> Live ITV match alongside presenter Adrian Chiles and Gareth Southgate. He appeared on ITV in the Champions League including Chelsea's victory in the final against Bayern Munich, nearly all FA Cup matches including the final between Chelsea and Liverpool at Wembley and England competitive internationals and friendlies. He was also involved in the ITV team for Euro 2012 alongside longtime rival Patrick Vieira and they appeared together as pundits in the Ireland–Spain match and Czech Republic–Russia match, also appearing with Roberto Martínez and Gordon Strachan.|$|E
5000|$|A {{particular}} {{soldier was}} {{thought to have been}} infatuated with Bauerdorf. He was described as [...] "swarthy". He had cut in <b>on</b> Bauerdorf during <b>nearly</b> <b>every</b> dance <b>on</b> the night of her death. Investigators checked U.S.O. centers and other canteens to try to find and question him. The soldier eventually contacted police and was completely exonerated, according to news accounts, although he was never identified.|$|R
5000|$|With great {{fluidity}} and freedom, Gilbert continually challenges {{our natural}} expectations. First, {{within the framework}} of the story, he makes bizarre things happen, and turns the world on its head. Thus the Learned Judge marries the Plaintiff, the soldiers metamorphose into aesthetes, and so <b>on,</b> and <b>nearly</b> <b>every</b> opera is resolved by a deft moving of the goalposts... His genius is to fuse opposites with an imperceptible sleight of hand, to blend the surreal with the real, and the caricature with the natural. In other words, to tell a perfectly outrageous story in a completely deadpan way.|$|R
50|$|In 1967, {{at the age}} of 30, {{he moved}} to Los Angeles and began playing {{regularly}} in Los Angeles and Santa Monica flamenco clubs like the Matador. In the late 1960s his idol, Greco, approached him after a performance and asked him to join the José Greco Dance company. They performed together during the early 1970s and Greco became a mentor to D'Auri. During the late 1970s D'Auri was performing at the Lares and El Cid and was said to be <b>on</b> stage <b>nearly</b> <b>every</b> night of the week. In 1976, he recorded with Caldera, a Latin band that combined jazz, funk, rock and Latin music on their self-titled debut album.|$|R
