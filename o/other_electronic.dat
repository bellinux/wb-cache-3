5|$|Spouge is a {{style of}} Barbadian popular music created by Jackie Opel in the 1960s. It is {{primarily}} a fusion of Jamaican ska with Trinidadian calypso, but is also influenced by {{a wide variety of}} musics from the British Isles and United States, include sea shanties, hymns and spirituals. Spouge instrumentation originally consisted of cowbell, bass guitar, trap set and various <b>other</b> <b>electronic</b> and percussion instruments, later augmented by saxophone, trombone and trumpets. Of these, the cowbell and the guitar are widely seen as the most integral part of the instrumentation, and are said to reflect the African origin of much of Barbadian music.|$|E
5|$|Sheffield {{has been}} home to several {{well-known}} bands and musicians, with a notably large number of synthpop and <b>other</b> <b>electronic</b> bands originating from the city. These include The Human League, Heaven 17, ABC and the more industrially inclined Cabaret Voltaire & Clock DVA. This electronic tradition has continued: techno label Warp Records was a central pillar of the Yorkshire Bleeps and Bass scene of the early 1990s, and {{has gone on to}} become one of the UK's oldest and best-loved dance music labels. More recently, other popular genres of electronic music such as bassline house have originated in the city. Sheffield was once home to a number of historically important nightclubs in the early dance music scene of the 1980s and 90s, Gatecrasher One was one of the most popular clubs in the North of England until its destruction by fire on 18 June 2007.|$|E

25|$|Tantalum capacitors, {{like most}} <b>other</b> <b>electronic</b> {{components}} and if enough space is available, have imprinted markings to indicate manufacturer, type, electrical and thermal characteristics, and date of manufacture. But most tantalum capacitors are chip types so the reduced space limits the imprinted signs to capacitance, tolerance, voltage and polarity.|$|E
25|$|Since {{individual}} carbon nanotubes {{are one of}} {{the most}} thermally conductive materials known, buckypaper lends itself to the development of heat sinks that would allow computers and <b>other</b> <b>electronic</b> equipment to disperse heat more efficiently than is currently possible. This, in turn, could lead to even greater advances in electronic miniaturization.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} of these properties enable copper to be specified for heat exchangers in industrial facilities, HVAC systems, vehicular coolers and radiators, and as heat sinks to cool computers, disk drives, televisions, computer monitors, and <b>other</b> <b>electronic</b> equipment. Copper is also incorporated into the bottoms of high-quality cookware because the metal conducts heat quickly and distributes it evenly.|$|E

30|$|According to Joshua Meyrowitz [33], ‘electronic media’ (radio, television, computers, etc.) {{promote a}} change in society by {{connecting}} previously separate social spaces and spheres with each <b>other.</b> Before <b>electronic</b> media, social spaces were tied to physical spaces. Physical barriers—walls, doors, windows etc.—controlled information flows and efficiently separated social spaces from each <b>other.</b> When <b>electronic</b> media made access to information less dependent on face-to-face communication, the connection between social spaces or roles and a specific physical space became slacker [45].|$|R

25|$|Tantalum {{capacitors}} are reliable on {{the same}} very high level as <b>other</b> <b>electronic</b> components with very low failure rates. However, they have a single unique failure mode called “field crystallization". Field crystallization is the major reason for degradation and catastrophic failures of solid tantalum capacitors. More than 90% of the today's rare failures in tantalum solid-state electrolytic capacitors are caused by shorts or increased leakage current due to this failure mode.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, house music, a direct descendent of disco, was forged in the {{underground}} clubs of Chicago, Detroit, and New York. The common element of most house music is a 4/4 beat generated by a drum machine or <b>other</b> <b>electronic</b> means (such as a sampler), together with a solid (usually also electronically-generated) bassline. Upon this foundation are added electronically generated sounds and samples of music such as jazz, blues, and synthpop.|$|E
