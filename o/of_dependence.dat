5|$|The {{new group}} of drugs was {{initially}} greeted with optimism by the medical profession, but gradually concerns arose; in particular, the risk <b>of</b> <b>dependence</b> became evident in the 1980s. Benzodiazepines have a unique history in that they {{were responsible for the}} largest-ever class-action lawsuit against drug manufacturers in the United Kingdom, involving 14,000 patients and 1,800 law firms that alleged the manufacturers knew of the dependence potential but intentionally withheld this information from doctors. At the same time, 117 general practitioners and 50 health authorities were sued by patients to recover damages for the harmful effects <b>of</b> <b>dependence</b> and withdrawal. This led some doctors to require a signed consent form from their patients and to recommend that all patients be adequately warned of the risks <b>of</b> <b>dependence</b> and withdrawal before starting treatment with benzodiazepines. The court case against the drug manufacturers never reached a verdict; legal aid had been withdrawn and there were allegations that the consultant psychiatrists, the expert witnesses, had a conflict of interest. This litigation led to changes in the British law, making class action lawsuits more difficult.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are also}} used to treat the acute panic caused by {{hallucinogen}} intoxication. Benzodiazepines {{are also used}} to calm the acutely agitated individual and can, if required, be given via an intramuscular injection. They can sometimes be effective in the short-term treatment of psychiatric emergencies such as acute psychosis as in schizophrenia or mania, bringing about rapid tranquillization and sedation until the effects of lithium or neuroleptics (antipsychotics) take effect. Lorazepam is most commonly used but clonazepam is sometimes prescribed for acute psychosis or mania; their long-term use is not recommended due to risks <b>of</b> <b>dependence.</b> Further research investigating the use of benzodiazepines alone and in combination with antipsychotic medications for treating acute psychosis is warranted.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines can {{be useful}} for {{short-term}} treatment of insomnia. Their use beyond 2 to 4 weeks is not recommended due to the risk <b>of</b> <b>dependence.</b> It is preferred that benzodiazepines be taken intermittently and at the lowest effective dose. They improve sleep-related problems by shortening the time spent in bed before falling asleep, prolonging the sleep time, and, in general, reducing wakefulness. However, they worsen sleep quality by increasing light sleep and decreasing deep sleep. Other drawbacks of hypnotics, including benzodiazepines, are possible tolerance to their effects, rebound insomnia, and reduced slow-wave sleep and a withdrawal period typified by rebound insomnia and a prolonged period of anxiety and agitation.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{electron}} correlation on the angle <b>dependence</b> <b>of</b> magnetoconductivity is studied in quasi-one-dimensional organic conductors. We investigated {{the effect on}} the basis <b>of</b> the momentum <b>dependence</b> <b>of</b> both quasi-particle's lifetime and velocity near the spin-density-wave (SDW). We found that the momentum <b>dependence</b> <b>of</b> quasi-particle's lifetime mainly governs the angle <b>dependence</b> <b>of</b> one-dimensional axis magnetoconductivity. On the other hand, the change in velocity originating from the electron correlation gives the dominant effects on the angle <b>dependence</b> <b>of</b> the interchain axis magnetoconductivity. The effect of electron correlation is clarified from the association <b>of</b> the momentum <b>dependences</b> <b>of</b> lifetime and velocity with the momentum <b>dependences</b> <b>of</b> commensurate orbitals on a Fermi surface in magnetic fields.

5|$|The {{best known}} {{cleaning}} symbioses are among marine fishes, where {{several species of}} small fish, notably of wrasse, are specialised in colour, pattern and behaviour as cleaners, providing a cleaning and ectoparasite removal service to larger, often predatory fish. Cleaner species, {{as shown in the}} table, vary widely in their degree <b>of</b> <b>dependence</b> on their clients. Some are essentially pure obligate symbionts like the cleaner wrasse; some are opportunistic or facultative symbionts, like the orange chromide or some cleaner shrimps; and some, like the oxpeckers, combine a little eating of parasites (beneficial to client) with taking of blood (harmful to client), their favoured food.|$|E
5|$|With that said, honeybees perform {{some level}} of {{pollination}} of nearly 75% of all plant species directly used for human food worldwide. Catastrophic loss of honeybees could have significant impact, therefore; {{it is estimated that}} seven out of the 60 major agricultural crops in North American economy would be lost, and this is only for one region of the world. Farms that have intensive systems (high density of crops) will be impacted the most compared to non-intensive systems (small local gardens that depend on wild bees) because <b>of</b> <b>dependence</b> on honeybees. These types of farms have a high demand for honeybee pollination services, which in the U.S. alone costs $1.25 billion annually. This cost is offset, however, as honeybees as pollinators generate 22.8 to 57 billion Euros globally.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines possess sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, and amnesic actions, {{which are}} useful {{in a variety of}} {{indications}} such as alcohol dependence, seizures, anxiety disorders, panic, agitation, and insomnia. Most are administered orally; however, they can also be given intravenously, intramuscularly, or rectally. In general, benzodiazepines are well-tolerated and are safe and effective drugs in the short term {{for a wide range of}} conditions. Tolerance can develop to their effects and there is also a risk <b>of</b> <b>dependence,</b> and upon discontinuation a withdrawal syndrome may occur. These factors, combined with other possible secondary effects after prolonged use such as psychomotor, cognitive, or memory impairments, limit their long-term applicability. The effects of long-term use or misuse include the tendency to cause or worsen cognitive deficits, depression, and anxiety. The College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia recommends discontinuing the usage of benzodiazepines in those on opioids and those who have used them long term.|$|E

5|$|The {{benefits}} of benzodiazepines are least {{and the risks}} are greatest in the elderly. The elderly are at an increased risk <b>of</b> <b>dependence</b> and are {{more sensitive to the}} adverse effects such as memory problems, daytime sedation, impaired motor coordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls, and an increased risk of hip fractures. The long-term effects of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine dependence in the elderly can resemble dementia, depression, or anxiety syndromes, and progressively worsens over time. Adverse effects on cognition can be mistaken for the effects of old age. The {{benefits of}} withdrawal include improved cognition, alertness, mobility, reduced risk incontinence, and a reduced risk of falls and fractures. The success of gradual-tapering benzodiazepines is as great in the elderly as in younger people. Benzodiazepines should be prescribed to the elderly only with caution and only for a short period at low doses. Short to intermediate-acting benzodiazepines are preferred in the elderly such as oxazepam and temazepam. The high potency benzodiazepines alprazolam and triazolam and long-acting benzodiazepines are not recommended in the elderly due to increased adverse effects. Nonbenzodiazepines such as zaleplon and zolpidem and low doses of sedating antidepressants are sometimes used as alternatives to benzodiazepines.|$|E
5|$|During the Italian campaign, and afterwards, {{during the}} {{struggle}} of the Papal Curia with Frederick, Manuel tried to seduce the Popes with hints of a possible union between the Eastern and Western churches. Although in 1155 Pope Hadrian had expressed his eagerness to prompt the reunion of the churches, hopes for a lasting Papal-Byzantine alliance came up against insuperable problems. Pope Adrian IV and his successors demanded recognition of their religious authority over all Christians everywhere and sought superiority over the Byzantine Emperor; they were not at all willing to fall into a state <b>of</b> <b>dependence</b> from one emperor to the other. Manuel, on the other hand, wanted an official recognition of his secular authority over both East and West. Such conditions would not be accepted by either side. Even if a pro-western Emperor such as Manuel agreed, the Greek citizens of the empire would have rejected outright any union of this sort, as they did almost three hundred years later when the Orthodox and Catholic churches were briefly united under the Pope. In spite of his friendliness towards the Roman Church and his cordial relations with all the Popes, Manuel was never honoured with the title of Augustus by the Popes. And although he twice sent embassies to Pope Alexander III (in 1167 and 1169) offering to reunite the Greek and Latin churches, the Pope refused, under pretext of the troubles that would follow union.* J. W. Birkenmeier, The Development of the Komnenian Army, 114 Ultimately, a deal proved elusive, and the two churches have remained divided.|$|E

Traditional {{measures of the}} nuclear stopping power are found sensitive to the magnitude but they are ambiguous for determining the isospin <b>dependence</b> <b>of</b> the in-medium NN cross sections.
