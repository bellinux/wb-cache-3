40|$|The methods most {{commonly}} used for determining <b>oxidative</b> <b>deterioration</b> of lipids in fish products are the peroxide value (POV), the carbonyl value, and the 2 -thiobarbituric acid value (TBAV). However, these tests are not always effective because {{they are based on}} the quantitative analyses of unstable oxidative products, which are also liable to react with components of fish products. In order to elucidate <b>oxidative</b> <b>deterioration</b> of lipids in fish meal and lyophilized fish muscle during storage, the authors advocate that it is more effective to measure the peak area ratio of C_ 22 : 6 to C_ 16 : 0 acids on gas chromatogram and to calculate decrease rate of C_ 22 : 6 acid as follows: Decrease rate of C_ 22 : 6 acid (%) = (1 － _tC_ 22 : 6 /tC_ 16 : 0 /_oC_ 22 : 6 /oC_ 16 : 0) × 100 Decrease rate of C_ 22 : 6 acid, POV and TBAV were measured for extracted lipids, fish meal and lyophilized fish muscle of jack mackerel (Trachurus japanicus) during the progress of <b>oxidative</b> <b>deterioration</b> of lipids. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. The changes in decrease rate of C_ 22 : 6 acid was more closely related with <b>oxidative</b> <b>deterioration</b> of lipids than those of POV and TBAV, because both POV and TBAV were liable to vary considerably with the composition of the samples and the conditions of oxidation (Figs. 1, 2). 2. In case of samples such as fish meal that lipids hydrolysis could be disregarded due to the inactivation of enzymes by the heating process, the decrease rate of C_ 22 : 6 acid of polar lipids was more available as an index for <b>oxidative</b> <b>deterioration</b> of lipids than those of non-polar and whole lipids (Fig. 7). 3. Oxidative products of lipids had no significant influence on GLC while determining the decrease rate of C_ 22 : 6 acid (Fig. 6). 脂質酸化指標としてガスクロマト法(GLC) によりC_ 22 : 6 酸減少率を測定することを提唱し,この測定法を用いてマアジ脂質,魚粉および凍結乾燥魚肉脂質の酸化過程をPOV,TBA価と比較,検討した. 1. 脂質酸化過程を正確に表現しえたのはC_ 22 : 6 酸減少率で,POVならびにTBA価は酸化の初期でのみ有効であつた. 2. 脂質加水分解酵素が関与しない試料では,極性脂質のC_ 22 : 6 酸減少率が,全脂質あるいは非極性脂質のC_ 22 : 6 酸減少率よりも鋭敏な酸化指標であつた. 3.

Several approaches were undertaken including an investigation on in vitro effects of various doses and durations of nicotine treatment on pre-implantation embryonic development. Results showed that nicotine treatment decreased the number of retrieved embryos, resulted embryo degeneration, delayed embryo cleavage, induced disproportionate size of blastomeres and degraded blastomeres (p< 0. 05). Moreover, the deleterious impact of nicotine on pre-implantation embryonic development was dose- and treatment duration-dependent with a corresponding increase in plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations (p< 0. 05). Based on this finding, the study was further elucidated in terms of examining the dose-related beneficial effects of y-TCT in nicotine-induced cessation of pre-implantation embryonic development in vitro. Results showed that y-TCT could prevent the duration- and dose-related deterioration of pre-implantation embryo quality when supplemented simultaneously with nicotine. Moreover, y-TCT of 60 mg/kg bw/day was found to be the optimal effective dose in lowering plasma levels of MDA during pre-implantation embryo development (p< 0. 05). Findings of in vitro study were applied in in vivo approach {{to evaluate the}} effect of simultaneous supplementation of y-TCT with nicotine on embryo development, blastocyst implantation, foetal growth, length of gestation, foetal outcome and survival rate of the neonates. Results showed that nicotine impaired post-implantation embryo growth and development (p< 0. 05). Pregnancy outcome and survival of the neonates were also reduced (p< 0. 05). The rise in oxidant levels reduced the enzymatic antioxidant defense system (p< 0. 05). < Pregnancy-related levels of progesterone (P₄) and oestrogen (E₂) were also significantly affected (p< 0. 05). Through combating nicotine-induced oxidative stress, y-TCT was able to sustain the physiological/normal sequence of blastocyst implantation, foetal growth, pregnancy outcome and survival of the neonates. Moreover, maintenance of pregnancy until term possibly resulted from sustaining the levels of plasma P₄ and E₂ as evident in normal pregnancy.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} irradiation on the oxidative quality changes during the storage, pork loin and turkey breast muscles were irradiated using an electron beam. Irradiation accelerated lipid oxidation, increased redness, and produced several sulfur (S) -volatiles that were responsible for the characteristic irradiation off-odor. This quality deterioration by irradiation was dependent on packaging conditions. Lipid oxidation was more problematic when meat was aerobically stored, whereas the production of S-volatiles was greater in vacuum-packaged irradiated raw meats. But when meat was freezer-stored, aerobic packaging was more susceptible to the production of both oxidation-dependent and S-volatiles. Irradiation made the color of meats redder and the redness was more distinct and stable under vacuum conditions. In irradiated meat, the production of carbon monoxide (CO), which can bind to myoglobin as a sixth ligand, was proportional to the irradiation dose. Oxidation-reduction potential was also decreased by irradiation indicating that more reducing conditions were supplied to heme pigments. Thus, it can be concluded that the increased a*-values in irradiated meat was caused by heme pigment-CO ligand formation. The absorption spectra of meat drip also showed that the peak wavelengths of irradiated meat were {{similar to those of the}} CO-myoglobin. Therefore, we suggest that CO-myoglobin be a major heme pigment responsible for the red or pink color in irradiated meats. These color changes and the mechanisms in irradiated raw meat were similar in irradiated precooked meat. A few strategies to reduce the <b>oxidative</b> quality <b>deterioration</b> of irradiated meats were studied. Addition of an antioxidant (sesamol, gallate, Trolox, or alpha-tocopherol) or their combination was effective in reducing the S-volatiles in vacuum-packaged irradiated meats or in controlling lipid oxidation in aerobically packaged irradiated ones. A modified packaging concept (double-packaging; combined use of vacuum and aerobic packaging) was also effective in eliminating S-volatiles and minimizing lipid oxidation during the storage. Especially, gallate + alpha-tocopherol along with double-packaging reduced effectively the red color of irradiated raw and cooked meats. These beneficial effects of double-packaging and antioxidant were more critical in irradiated cooked meat, and it was a very effective method to control the oxidative quality changes of irradiated meats...|$|R

In analysis of fatty acids the amount of PUFA, especially ω- 3 ones, was more predominant in mackerel than shark, nevertheless, fatty acid composition has changed in both species during frozen storage. The amount of saturated fatty acids in contrast with unsaturated fatty acids increased due to oxidation of PUFA. The decrease in PUFA compounds (40. 1 % and 23. 94 %) was as follows: ω- 3 (48 % and 42. 83 %), ω- 3 / ω- 6 ratio (41. 36 % and 50 %), PUFA/SFA ratio (56 % and 42. 23 %) and EPA+DHA/C 16 ratio (55. 55 % and 46. 66 %) in mackerel and shark, respectively. For both species, tiobarbituric acid (TBA), peroxide (PV), free fatty acids (FFA) and total volatile base nitrogen (TVB-N) values were significantly (P< 0. 05) increased with storage time. The results showed that, among these indices, changes in the PV and TBA in mackerel were significantly (P< 0. 05) larger than in shark; but changes of FFA and TVB-N in shark were significantly (P< 0. 05) higher than in mackerel.

An extensive study was conducted in a postmenopausal osteoporosis rat model using several LP doses and duration of treatments to determine if anti-oxidative mechanisms were involved in its bone protective effects. Ninety-six female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into six groups; baseline group (BL), sham-operated (Sham), ovariectomised control (OVXC), ovariectomised (OVX) and given 64. 5 μg/kg of Premarin (ERT), ovariectomised and given 20 mg/kg of LP (LP 20) and ovariectomised and given 100 mg/kg of LP (LP 100). The groups were further subdivided to receive their respective treatments via daily oral gavages for three, six or nine weeks of treatment periods. Following euthanization, the femora were dissected out for bone oxidative measurements which include superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Results: The SOD levels of the sham-operated and all the treatment groups were significantly higher than the OVX groups at all treatment periods. The GPx level of ERT and LP 100 groups at the 9 th week of treatment were significantly higher than the baseline and OVX groups.

40|$|The work {{presented}} here explores {{the effect of}} storage on chemical and other characteristics of dry, free of added chemicals and pest-free barley and canola grain. This was achieved by measuring the changes {{in a number of}} variables of grain stored at different temperatures under laboratory conditions and in commercial storage. The following measurements were carried out: Viability, moisture contents (mc), oil contents (oc), whole grain colour, spectrophotometry of grain extracts, hydroxy methyl furaldehyde (HMF), changes in storage atmospheres, organic sulphide levels, tocol concentrations (vitamin E), Iodine Value (IV), Thiocyanogen Value (TV), Peroxide Value (PV), p-Anisidine Value (p-AV) and Acid Value (AV). The mc of canola and barley were within the range considered safe for storage. Oil content of canola did not change significantly with storage. Viability of canola stored at 4 and 25 C did not change noticeably, but higher storage temperatures resulted in seed death. Barley maintained high viabilities at low temperatures, but was more susceptible to high temperatures than canola. Colour changes of whole barley grain in storage were pronounced and temperature dependent. Colorimetry of whole barley grain showed potential as a tool for monitoring quality changes in storage. Absorption spectra of grain extracts reflected chemical and physiological changes in storage. HMF, an indicator of Maillard browning, accumulated in short to medium term storage at 45 C and in long term storage at 25 and 35 C. Measurement of HMF was considered useful for monitoring quality changes of stored cereal grain. In a study of storage atmospheres, changes in the concentrations of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, oxygen, carbon disulphide and carbonyl sulphide were shown to be useful indicators of quality loss of grain in storage. Gas concentrations usually depended on storage temperature and time and reflected the storage history of the commodity. They indicated loss of carbohydrates and lipids by respiration, <b>oxidative</b> damage and <b>deterioration</b> of sulphur containing amino acids and other compounds. Oil quality indicators were consistent with oxidative damage to canola lipids in storage. IV, TV, and p-AV of canola oil did not correlate with quality of commercial samples. However, a relationship between increases in PV and high storage temperatures in canola was shown and AV increased in storage dependent on storage temperature and time. In barley and canola, the concentration of anti-oxidant tocol species (vitamin E) decreased at 35 and 45 C storage dependent on storage time. The overall tocol content as well as vitamin E activity decreased with storage decreasing the nutritional value of the commodities and indicating oxidative damage to lipids. It was concluded that the storage of dry, pest-free whole barley and canola grain at moderate temperatures (25 - 45 C) resulted in chemical and other changes. The consequence of these changes was a measurable reduction in the freshness of grain relevant to the nutritional, food technological and commercial quality of grain...|$|R

The contribution of compositional factors (e. g., type {{and amount of}} emulsifier, fat phase, etc.) is further elucidated. Among 10 % cottonseed o/w emulsions prepared by 1 % emulsifier (Tween, sodium caseinate, or whey protein), lipid autoxidation (at 40 degrees C) was much faster in the Tween emulsion than in the protein ones, with whey protein presenting a clear antioxidant effect. Increase in protein concentration (0. 5 - 2 % w/w) led to a decrease in droplet size but an increase in oxidative stability, in terms of conjugated diene hydroperoxides formation at 232 nm. The type of lipid phase significantly affected the rate of thermal oxidation at 60 degrees C. In the most oxidatively vulnerable sunflower-oil-based emulsions, an increase in fat content (10 - 40 %) resulted in a reduction of <b>oxidative</b> <b>deterioration.</b> By selecting a more concentrated emulsion (20 % o/w, 2 % emulsifier), in order to structurally approach real novel food products, any influence of {{the composition of the}} emulsifier (combination of Tween and sodium caseinate preparation) was subsequently tested.

In {{the first part}} of the study, relative antioxidant capacity and total phenol content of the extract were determined and found as 966. g ascorbic acid eq. /mg and 197. 42 mg GAEq/g sample, respectively. In the second part, microdilution assays were conducted by 96 well plate for OLE to find minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) against Gram (+) and Gram (-) bacteria. The most susceptible bacteria were Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua and Staphylococcus carnosus. In the third part OLE was applied to raw beef cubes with 1 %, 2 % and 3 % (v/w) concentrations to examine its antimicrobial and antioxidant effects. The results clearly indicated that usage of 2 % and 3 % OLE had the beneficial effect in controlling the microbial load, total viable and coliform counts, of beef cubes during 9 days of storage at 4 C. The 2 % OLE treatment applied to beef cubes also delayed the <b>oxidative</b> <b>deterioration</b> compared to the other samples. As the last part of the study, 300 ppm OLE was applied to sardine (Sardina pilchardus) fillets as a marinade component. Results indicated that OLE was effective in controlling microbial load of sardine fillets and also delayed the <b>oxidative</b> <b>deterioration</b> and total volatile base nitrogen formation in the fillets during marination process...|$|E

To retard the <b>oxidative</b> <b>deterioration,</b> synthetic and natural antioxidants may be added. Herb and spice extracts can be sources of natural biologically active substances with antioxidant activity. In this work, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to monitor the lipid oxidation in cookies with rosemary and thyme extracts subjected to the storage in elevated temperature. It was shown that thyme extract {{can be used as}} a natural antioxidant source for the preparation of bakery products, while the rosemary extract should be used with care in fat-rich products exposed to high temperatures...|$|E
40|$|The {{toxicity}} {{associated with}} nickel (II) and chromium (VI) is mainly due to generation of {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) with subsequent <b>oxidative</b> <b>deterioration</b> of biological macromolecules. Both nickel and chromium can generate free radicals (FR) directly from molecular oxygen in a two step process to produce superoxide anion and in continued process, produce highly toxic hydroxyl radical. The pro-oxidative effects are compounded by fact that they also inhibit antioxidant enzymes and deplete intracellular glutathione. Garlic (Allium sativum) has played an important dietary and medicinal role {{throughout the history of}} mankind. Garlic has the potential to enhance the endogenous antioxidant status in nickel as well as hexavalent chromium induced lipid peroxidation in normal and diabetic rats...|$|E
40|$|Most flame-retarded polymer {{products}} need to {{be highly}} durable throughout their service lifetime in many demanding applications areas such as construction, transportation, electric equipment, and textiles, where low flammability in combination with high resistance toward <b>oxidative</b> <b>deterioration</b> triggered {{by the action of}} light, heat, and/or mechanical stress is a mandatory quality. To achieve this, it is essential to better understand the overall interplay (both physical and chemical processes) between different components such as different flame retardant structures in their respective polymers and in the presence of coadditives such as processing stabilizers, antioxidants, light stabilizers, metal deactivators, filler deactivators, ultraviolet absorbers, and so on, in the flame-retarded polymer product. In this article, the key difficulties in improving weathering resistance of flame-retarded polymers are reviewed...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe <b>oxidative</b> <b>deterioration</b> of glycerol-bound {{polyunsaturated}} {{fatty acids}} (PUFAs) in culinary {{oils and fats}} during episodes of heating associated with normal usage (30 – 90 min at 180 °C) has been monitored by high field 1 H NMR spectroscopy. Thermal stressing of PUFA-rich culinary oils generated high levels of n-alkanals, trans- 2 -alkenals, alka- 2, 4 -dienals and 4 -hydroxy-trans- 2 -alkenals via decomposition of their conjugated hydroperoxydiene precursors, whereas only low concentrations of selected aldehydes were produced in oils with a low PUFA content, lard and dripping when subjected to the above heating episodes. Samples of repeatedly used, PUFA-rich culinary oils obtained from restaurants also contained high levels of each class of aldehyde. The dietary, physiological and toxicological ramifications of the results obtained are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{approved}} ff f J v (Major professor) Malonaldehyde, a three carbon dialdehyde, {{is one of}} the numer-ous {{carbonyl compounds}} associated with <b>oxidative</b> <b>deterioration</b> of food lipids. It is assumed to be formed as a product of lipid autoxi-dation occurring according to the generally accepted free radical mechanism. This compound is of great interest because of its poten-tial high reactivity and its wide occurrence in autoxidized lipids. Malonaldehyde may participate in eliciting some of the adverse bio-logical and chemical effects of in vitro and in vivo lipid autoxidation. In this investigation a micro 2 -thiobarbituric acid analysis for malonaldehyde in various biological materials was developed; the acute toxicity, subacute toxicity and associated physiological respon-ses were determined; and the reaction of malonaldehyde with glycine and protein was investigated...|$|E
40|$|Virgin {{olive oil}} {{has a high}} {{resistance}} to <b>oxidative</b> <b>deterioration</b> due to its tryacylglycerol composition low in polyunsaturated fatty acids and due {{to the presence of}} a group of phenolic antioxidants composed mainly of polyphenols and tocopherols. We isolated several phenolic compounds of extra virgin olive oil (phenyl-ethyl alcohols, lignans, and secoiridoids) by semipreparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and identified them using ultraviolet, atmospheric pressure chemical ionization, and electrospray ionization MS detection. The purity of these extracts was confirmed by analytical HPLC using two different gradients. Finally, the antioxidant capacity of the isolated compounds was evaluated by measuring the radical scavenging effect on 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl radical, by accelerated oxidation in a lipid model system (OSI, oxidative stability instrument), and by an electrochemical method.

40|$|Biophenols are potent natural {{antioxidants}} {{that protect}} food quality by preventing <b>oxidative</b> <b>deterioration</b> of lipids. During heat treatment this protective rule prevents oxidation caused by many factors, as high temperature reached, presence of oxygen and water contained in food matrix. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the frying performance of high oleic oil enriched in biophenols, comparing its thermal stability with those of high oleic oil (control sample) during thermo-oxidation and deep fat frying process. Positive effects when biophenols were added to oil were found: lower acidity levels, lower TPC values during the first 16 hours of heat treatment, absence of short chain fatty acids (C 8 : 0) until 24 h of thermo-oxidation treatment and detection of lower acrylamide content in French friesrespect to those fried in the control oil. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{evaluated}} the antioxidant and the scavenging ability of C 14, C 15 and C 16 bacillomycin D-like lipopeptides produced by B 38 strain. They all displayed strong reducing power activity, hydroxyl and superoxide anion radicals scavenging activities and inhibition of lipid peroxidation. In addition, {{they were found}} to protect plasmid DNA damage from hydroxyl radical oxidation. Data suggested that their antioxidant potency {{can be attributed to}} the hydrophobic and aromatic side-chain groups of their amino acids as well as to the aliphatic chain of their beta amino fatty acids. Note that the hydrocarbon chain length did not interfere with the antioxidant power. Overall, such bacillomycin D lipopeptides which exhibit antioxidant and radical scavenging activities may be useful for cosmetic, therapeutic or pharmaceutical purposes in order to delay or prevent <b>oxidative</b> <b>deterioration</b> of manufactured products...|$|E
40|$|The {{challenge}} {{in the development of}} infant formulas enriched with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) is to meet the consumers’ expectations with regard to high nutritional and sensory value. In particular, PUFAs may be prone to fatty acid oxidation that can generate potential rancid, metallic and/or fishy off-flavors. Although such off-flavors pose no health risk, they can nevertheless lead to rejection of products by consumers. Thus, monitoring autoxidation at its early stages is of great importance and finding a suitable analytical tool to perform these evaluations is therefore of high interest in quality monitoring. Two formulations of infant formulas were varied systematically in their mineral composition and their presence of antioxidants to produce 18 model formulas. All models were aged under controlled conditions and their <b>oxidative</b> <b>deterioration</b> was monitored. A quantitative study was performed on seven characteristic odor-active secondary oxidation products in the formulations via two-dimensional high resolution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/olfactometry (2 D-HRGC-MS/O). The sensitivity of the multi-dimensional GC-MS/O analysis was supported by two additional analytical tools for monitoring autoxidation, namely the analysis of lipid hydroperoxides and conjugated dienes. Furthermore, an aroma profile analysis (APA) was performed to reveal the presence and intensities of typical odor qualities generated in the course of fatty acid oxidation. The photometrical analyses of lipid hydroperoxides and conjugated dienes were found to be too insensitive for early indication of the development of sensory defects. By comparison, the 2 D-HRGC-MS/O was capable of monitoring peroxidation of PUFAs at low ppb-level in its early stages. Thereby, it was possible to screen oxidative variances on the basis of such volatile markers already within eight weeks after production of the products, which is an earlier indication of <b>oxidative</b> <b>deterioration</b> than achievable via conventional methods. In detail, oxidative variances between the formulations revealed that lipid oxidation was low when copper was administered in an encapsulated form and when antioxidants (vitamin E, ascorbyl palmitate) were present...|$|E

The <b>oxidative</b> <b>deterioration</b> of the products was determined by hydroperoxide measurements and by trained and consumer sensory evaluations. The hydroperoxide content of the supple- mented yogurts increased over the storage treatment and was unaffected by the stage of addition. The trained panel could distinguish a stronger fishy flavour in both of the supplemented yogurts after 22 days storage, but the consumer panel rated both control and supplemented samples similarly, as ‘ moderately liked ’...|$|E
