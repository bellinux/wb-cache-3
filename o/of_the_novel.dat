5|$|Le Guin was {{strongly}} opposed to and {{troubled by the}} Vietnam War, a reaction which played a large part in the tone <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel.</b> The tone <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> is often harsh and hard-hitting, playing off the anger in the United States at American military actions in Vietnam. The tension between violence and non-violence {{is a part of}} the dialectic theme in the novel, of a constant tension between opposites. Through most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel,</b> the Terran military is in control of the colony, despite Raj Lyubov's good intentions. Davidson is the most prominent example of the oppressiveness of the military government. There are intentional parallels drawn between the Terran colonizers and the US intervention in Vietnam; the anti-interventionist tone <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> was in sharp contrast to other science-fiction novels about war written around the same period. For example, the high use of drugs amongst US troops in Vietnam is represented by the use of hallucinogens amongst the Terran soldiers, which Le Guin portrays as the norm on the colony.|$|E
