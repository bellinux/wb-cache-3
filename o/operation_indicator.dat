International Maritime (IMO) has set a target of 20 % CO 2 reduction from shipping by 2020 and also presented a series of carbon emission reduction methods, which are known as Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) and Energy Efficiency <b>Operation</b> <b>Indicator</b> (EEOI). Reviews on carbon emission reduction from all industries indicate that, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is an excellent solution to global warming. In this paper, a comprehensive literature review of EEDI and EEOI and CCS is conducted and involves reviewing current policies, introducing common technologies, and considering their feasibilities for marine activities, mainly shipping. Current projects are also presented in this paper, thereby illustrating that carbon emission reduction {{has been the subject}} of attention from all over the world. Two case ship studies indicate the economic feasibility of carbon emission reduction and provide a guide for CCS system application and practical installation on ships...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To {{test the}} design of a patient care regimen for soft lenses that aims to provide the highest {{standards}} of disinfecting through use of domestic microwave cookers, while also providing storage equipment and solution that enable patients to follow a conventional cold disinfecting regimen when traveling. The cleaning efficacy of surfactant agents during microwave treatment was also considered. Methods. The microbiologic performance of the regimen and its disinfecting apparatus was tested according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) protocols for contact lens heat disinfectors. Subsequently, a prospective pilot clinical trial of the regimen involving 15 subjects was carried out to the protocols of the FDA and International Standards Organization 11, 980 : 1997. Results. Lenses inoculated with 107 colony-forming units (cfu) of Enterococcus faecalis were disinfected to 0 cfu by a 12 -s irradiation of a compact disinfecting case that held the lenses suspended in 12 ml saline.

30|$|The {{proposed}} algorithm {{with simple}} polynomial operation instead of complicated convolution calculation greatly improves the computation efficiency. In addition, the proposed method {{can deal with}} chronological wind power and demand, and the system operation can be simulated hour by hour, which makes the simulation results more detailed and ample. On this basis, it provides a more powerful simulation and analysis tool. When large-scale wind power penetrates into power grid, {{it is important to}} assess both the impact of wind power on grid operation and the consumption of wind power effectively. However, wind power and load are different from time to time, so it is necessary to simulate the system balance between supply and demand hour by hour. However, traditional methods like the method in [21] can only obtain the total output of units and statistical reliability indices in the whole simulation period rather than every hour. Compared with traditional method, the proposed method can calculate the power system <b>operation</b> <b>indicators</b> at any moment during the simulation period, as well as the probability and expectations of wind power curtailment. The assessment method for wind power accommodation and curtailment is used in the following case study.|$|R

Spatial regression techniques are revised, followed by a discussion on social vulnerability and customer satisfaction indicators. Operational data obtained from AES Eletropaulo’s geographical information systems were combined with secondary data in order to generate predictive regression models, having energy loss as the response variable. Results show that the incorporation of market and social oriented data about customers substantially contribute to explicate energy loss – the coefficient of determination in the regression models rose from 17. 76 % to 63. 29 % when the simpler model was compared to the more complex one.

We hypothesized that practices {{with a higher}} com-bined commercial insurance (CCI) mix would experience greater inefficiencies in insurance billing (IB) processes and higher IB administrative costs. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was administered to a national pool of private hematology-oncology practices. Prac-tices were identified through the ASCO online registry. Partici-pants self-reported insurance information. T and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to compare high (50 % or more) Medicare payer mix groups and high (50 % or more) CCI payer mix groups for practice <b>operation</b> <b>indicators.</b> These tests were also used to compare denial processing cost per Medicare patient and CCI patient. Results: Among the 33 practices that responded to the sur-vey, themean total IB administrative cost for highMedicare payer mix groups was $ 191, 646. 25 (standard deviation [SD], $ 173, 031. 63), significantly lower (P. 0454) than the mean for high CCI groups at $ 476, 280. 00 (SD, $ 475, 408. 57). The mean annual cost per IB support staff member was significantly higher (P. 0453) in the high CCI group at $ 49, 778. 67 (SD $ 14, 896. 32) compared with the mean cost in the high Medicare group, which was $ 39, 413. 08 (SD, $ 12, 068. 17).

40|$|AbstractForce and {{pressure}} sensors {{are commonly used}} in systems to measure balance and postural sway. When it comes to biomechanics in sports, trainers and therapists often rely on those measurement methods to set up rehabilitation and performance enhancement exercises. To prove sensor reliability and the comparability of various systems, a programmable human sway simulator (PHSS) apparatus was developed to enable standardized and reproducible human-like load simulations. The apparatus {{can be used to}} test computerized dynamic posturography (CDP) systems, instrumented balance and training systems or any static sensor of that kind. Results from CDP systems provide information for a more efficient and focused athlete coordination training. Due to the variety of CDP instruments on the market the question arises, whether these systems provide reliable results. With the developed prototype impartial comparison of these systems will be possible. For the test procedures it is required to create predefined sway patterns with varying loads to simulate human mass from kids to adults. These loads have to be applied over footprints representing the human forefoot and heel. The conceptual design of the PHSS was performed using reliable industry standard components for rapid production. The operating system simulates the motion of human mass via four separated DC-Motors in order to record indicators of the tested system such as center of pressure (COP), range of motion (ROM) and applied load frequency. Besides that, the PHSS includes a monitoring of motor positioning to retrieve <b>operation</b> <b>indicators</b> for self-check and calibration. With all that, the PHSS allows direct comparison of CDP systems that record ground reaction forces (GRF) or verify the long term precision of sensors as a quality assurance tool.
