5|$|Cells {{are known}} to {{eliminate}} three types <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> to their DNA by chemically reversing it. These mechanisms do not require a template, since the types <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> they counteract can occur in {{only one of the}} four bases. Such direct reversal mechanisms are specific to the type <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> incurred and do not involve breakage of the phosphodiester backbone. The formation of pyrimidine dimers upon irradiation with UV light results in an abnormal covalent bond between adjacent pyrimidine bases. The photoreactivation process directly reverses this damage by the action of the enzyme photolyase, whose activation is obligately dependent on energy absorbed from blue/UV light (300–500nm wavelength) to promote catalysis. Photolyase, an old enzyme present in bacteria, fungi, and most animals no longer functions in humans, who instead use nucleotide excision repair to repair damage from UV irradiation. Another type <b>of</b> <b>damage,</b> methylation of guanine bases, is directly reversed by the protein methyl guanine methyl transferase (MGMT), the bacterial equivalent of which is called ogt. This is an expensive process because each MGMT molecule can be used only once; that is, the reaction is stoichiometric rather than catalytic. A generalized response to methylating agents in bacteria is known as the adaptive response and confers a level of resistance to alkylating agents upon sustained exposure by upregulation of alkylation repair enzymes. The third type of DNA damage reversed by cells is certain methylation of the bases cytosine and adenine.|$|E

However, kitchen cabinet supplier is facing with major problem regarding to the increasing number of failure that occurred at the screw jointing during kitchen cabinet installation. Thus, the objective of the study is to observed the failure or damages during screw fixing on kitchen cabinet. It was observed that the screw head and driving features effect the number <b>of</b> <b>damages</b> and the failure mode type. Screw with pan-head type has the lowest number <b>of</b> <b>damages</b> compared with countersunk head screw. Selecting screw insertion technique is also important in order to reduce number <b>of</b> <b>damages.</b> Insertion technique with pilot-hole pre-drilling managed to reduce number <b>of</b> <b>damages</b> and type <b>of</b> failure modes occurred. With this paper, the kitchen cabinet manufacturer will be able to select the best screw with their preferable insertion technique {{in order to reduce the}} number <b>of</b> <b>damages</b> used for kitchen cabinet jointing...|$|R
