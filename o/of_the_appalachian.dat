5|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of European American {{settlers}} and explorers, the Allegheny Plateau region of West Virginia, lying {{to the west of the}} Allegheny and Cumberland mountain ranges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Appalachian</b> Mountains, was overlaid with old-growth forests consisting predominantly of deciduous mixed oaks and chestnut trees. The cove forests <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Appalachian</b> Mountains were undisturbed for approximately 300 million years, and the ample moisture and deep soils of cove topography allowed for the proliferation of temperate broadleaf and mixed forest species.|$|E
5|$|An {{extension}} {{known as}} the International Appalachian Trail continues northeast, crossing Maine and cutting through Canada to Newfoundland, with sections continuing in Greenland, through Europe, and into Morocco. Other separate extensions continue the southern end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Appalachian</b> range in Alabama and continue south into Florida, creating what is {{known as the}} Eastern Continental Trail.|$|E

25|$|The {{mountains}} to <b>the</b> south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Alleghenies—the <b>Appalachians</b> in westernmost Virginia, eastern Kentucky, and eastern Tennessee—are the Cumberlands.

50|$|Geologically, the Cobequid Mountains are {{considered}} part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Appalachians.</b> <b>The</b> range stretches from Cape Chignecto in Cumberland County {{in the west}} through to Pictou County in the east.|$|R
5|$|In {{the course}} of its journey, the trail follows the ridge line <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Appalachian</b> Mountains, {{crossing}} many of its highest peaks, and running, {{with only a few}} exceptions, almost continuously through wilderness.

5|$|The terrain amplified the {{importance}} of the site. Both lakes were long and narrow and oriented north–south, as were the many ridge lines <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Appalachian</b> Mountains extending as far south as Georgia, creating the near-impassable mountainous terrains to the east and west of the Great Appalachian Valley that the site commanded.|$|E
2500|$|The Piedmont {{hills in}} the central county {{are made up of}} ancient {{metamorphic}} rocks such as schist, <b>the</b> roots <b>of</b> several ancestral ranges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Appalachians.</b> [...] <b>The</b> western valley is floored with more recent shale and sandstone.

5|$|Overhill Cherokee was {{the term}} for the Cherokee people located in their {{historic}} settlements {{in what is now}} the U.S. state of Tennessee in the Southeastern United States, on the west side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Appalachian</b> Mountains.

5|$|The breed was {{originally}} developed for general {{use on the}} farms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Appalachian</b> foothills, where it was found pulling plows and buggies, working cattle and being ridden by both adults and children. Today, it is still used for working cattle, as well as endurance riding and pleasure riding. The breed's gait and disposition make it sought out by elderly and disabled riders. Each September, the Kentucky Horse Park hosts the International Rocky Mountain Horse Show.|$|E
5|$|The {{speed limit}} is , due to curves, {{wildlife}} and tourists. Bicycles, motor vehicles, and pedestrians share the road. There are also deer, black bears, turkey, and other wildlife, which may appear and cross the road without warning. These all require extra precautions.
