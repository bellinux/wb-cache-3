50|$|Most {{scientists}} and conservationists agree that no {{place on earth}} is completely untouched by humanity, either due to past occupation by indigenous people, or through global processes such as climate change. Activities on the margins <b>of</b> specific <b>wilderness</b> areas, such as fire suppression and the interruption of animal migration, also affect the interior <b>of</b> <b>wildernesses.</b>|$|R
5|$|As farmers {{worldwide}} {{respond to}} higher crop prices {{in order to}} maintain the global food supply-and-demand balance, pristine lands are cleared to replace the food crops that were diverted elsewhere to biofuels' production. Because natural lands, such as rainforests and grasslands, store carbon in their soil and biomass as plants grow each year, clearance <b>of</b> <b>wilderness</b> for new farms translates to a net increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Due to this change in the carbon stock of the soil and the biomass, indirect land use change has consequences in the GHG balance of a biofuel.|$|E
5|$|By 1907 President Theodore Roosevelt {{more than}} doubled the forest reserve acreage, and Congress responded by {{limiting}} the President’s ability to proclaim new reserves. The National Forest System underwent a major reorganization in 1908, and in 1911 Congress authorized new additions to the system {{under the authority of}} the Weeks Act. The management goals provided by the Organic Act were expanded upon by the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960 to include “outdoor recreation, range, timber, watershed, and wildlife and fish purposes” {{as well as for the}} establishment <b>of</b> <b>wilderness</b> areas.|$|E
5|$|In practice, {{the huge}} Valdez glacier that stood between the port and the Alaskan {{interior}} proved almost insurmountable and only 200 managed to climb it; by 1899, {{the cold and}} scurvy was causing many deaths amongst the rest. Other prospectors attempted an alternative route across the Malaspina Glacier just to the east, suffering even greater hardships. Those who did manage to cross it found themselves having to negotiate miles <b>of</b> <b>wilderness</b> before they could reach Dawson. Their expedition was forced {{to turn back the}} same way they had come with only four men surviving.|$|E

5|$|On a {{strategic}} scale, a natural choke point was present between the northern shore of Lake Peipus and the Gulf of Finland. The 45 kilometre wide {{strip of land}} was entirely bisected by the Narva River and had large areas <b>of</b> <b>wilderness.</b> The primary transportation routes, the Narva–Tallinn highway and railway, ran on an east-west axis near and parallel to the coastline. There were no other east-west transportation routes capable of sustaining troop movement {{on a large scale}} in the region.|$|E
5|$|William Beebe was {{a pioneer}} in the field now known as ecology. His theory that organisms must be {{understood}} {{in the context of the}} ecosystems they inhabit was completely new for its time, and has been highly influential. The method he invented of methodically analyzing all organisms within a small area <b>of</b> <b>wilderness</b> has become a standard method in this field. Beebe was also {{a pioneer in the}} field of oceanography, setting a precedent with his Bathysphere dives which many other researchers would follow.|$|E
5|$|Beebe {{undertook}} {{an expedition}} to Brazil in 1915, {{for the purpose of}} capturing more birds for the zoo. This expedition was an important turning point for Beebe in several ways. Beebe had far more field experience than either of the two others accompanying him on the expedition, G. Inness Hartler and Herbert Atkins, making this his introduction to the role of a mentor. During this expedition, Beebe was also amazed to discover the number and variety of organisms living under a single tree, and pioneered the method of studying a small area <b>of</b> <b>wilderness</b> for an extended amount of time. This expedition marked the beginning of a shift for Beebe from ornithology to the study of tropical ecosystems.|$|E

5|$|Environmental {{issues have}} been on the {{national}} agenda since 1970. Environmental controversies include debates on oil and nuclear energy, dealing with air and water pollution, the economic costs of protecting wildlife, logging and deforestation, and international responses to global warming. Many federal and state agencies are involved. The most prominent is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), created by presidential order in 1970. The idea <b>of</b> <b>wilderness</b> has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is intended to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats, which are monitored by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.|$|E
5|$|Forests cover 65% of the state, {{primarily}} with deciduous, broad leaf {{trees in the}} western part of the state and evergreens and conifers dominant the central and eastern part of Virginia. Lower altitudes are more likely to have small but dense stands of moisture-loving hemlocks and mosses in abundance, with hickory and oak in the Blue Ridge. However, since the early 1990s, Gypsy moth infestations have eroded the dominance of oak forests. In the lowland tidewater and piedmont, yellow pines tend to dominate, with bald cypress wetland forests in the Great Dismal and Nottoway swamps. Other common trees and plants include red bay, wax myrtle, dwarf palmetto, tulip poplar, mountain laurel, milkweed, daisies, and many species of ferns. The largest areas <b>of</b> <b>wilderness</b> are along the Atlantic coast and in the western mountains, where the largest populations of trillium wildflowers in North America are found. The Atlantic coast regions are host to flora commonly associated with the South Atlantic pine forests and lower Southeast Coastal Plain maritime flora, the latter found primarily in eastern and central Virginia.|$|E
