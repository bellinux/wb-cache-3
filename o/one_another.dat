5|$|Both leagues play a 143-game regular season, {{after which}} the top three teams in each league compete against <b>one</b> <b>another</b> in a {{two-stage}} playoff. In the First Stage, the teams that finish the regular season with the second- and third-best records play <b>one</b> <b>another</b> in a best-of-three series. The winners of these three-game series advance to the Final Stage to face each league's regular-season champion in a six-game series, which the regular-season champion starts with a one-game advantage. The winners of each league's Final Stage series compete against <b>one</b> <b>another</b> in that year's Japan Series.|$|E
5|$|A third {{component}} of motion that occurs relatively infrequently involves {{the interaction of}} multiple tropical cyclones. When two cyclones approach <b>one</b> <b>another,</b> their centers will begin orbiting cyclonically about a point between the two systems. Depending on their separation distance and strength, the two vortices may simply orbit around <b>one</b> <b>another</b> or else may spiral into the center point and merge. When the two vortices are of unequal size, the larger vortex will tend to dominate the interaction, and the smaller vortex will orbit around it. This phenomenon is called the Fujiwhara effect, after Sakuhei Fujiwhara.|$|E

5|$|Most gunfights {{are portrayed}} in films or books as having two men square off, waiting {{for one to}} make the first move. This was rarely the case. Often, a gunfight was spur-of-the-moment, with one drawing his pistol, and the other reacting. Often it would develop into a shootout where both men bolted for cover. In popular folklore, men who held {{noteworthy}} reputations as a gunfighter were eager to match up against another gunman with the same reputation. On the contrary, in cases where two men held a similar reputation, both would avoid confrontation with <b>one</b> <b>another</b> whenever possible. They rarely took undue risks, and usually weighed their options before confronting another well-known gunman. This respect for <b>one</b> <b>another</b> is why most famous gunfights were rarely two or more well-known gunmen matched up against <b>one</b> <b>another,</b> but rather one notable gunman against a lesser-known opponent or opponents.|$|E

5|$|The flesh in {{the gills}} is {{composed}} of cylindrical hyphae measuring between 4 and 8μm thick that run parallel to <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> The hyphae typically have fairly thin, smooth walls, but {{they can have a}} small amount of brown pigment, which stains orange-brown in potassium hydroxide. The pileipellis, the uppermost layer of hyphae in the cap, forms a cutis made up of cylindrical, slightly thicker-walled hyphae of between 5 and 10μm wide. They can be interwoven or primarily extending from the margin to the centre. The pigmentation is yellowish-brown and stains reddish-brown in potassium hydroxide. The hyphae below the pileipellis run parallel to <b>one</b> <b>another</b> and measure between 4 and 8μm in width. Their yellowish-brown pigment stains orange-brown in potassium hydroxide. The stipitipellis, the uppermost layer of hyphae on the stem, also forms a cutis. The cylindrical hyphae run parallel to <b>one</b> <b>another</b> and have thick cell walls. They have a dark red-brown pigment, which stains darker still in potassium hydroxide. Clamp connections are present.|$|E
