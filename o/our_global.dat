500|$|During the five-years {{from the}} end of 2004 through 2009, {{worldwide}} renewable energy capacity grew at rates of 10–60 percent annually for many technologies, while actual production grew 1.2% overall. In 2011, UN under-secretary general Achim Steiner said: [...] "The continuing growth in this core segment of the green economy is not happening by chance. The combination of government target-setting, policy support and stimulus funds is underpinning the renewable industry's rise and bringing the much needed transformation of <b>our</b> <b>global</b> energy system within reach." [...] He added: [...] "Renewable energies are expanding both in terms of investment, projects and geographical spread. In doing so, they are making an increasing contribution to combating climate change, countering energy poverty and energy insecurity".|$|E

Daybreaker lyrics were written by Carter and Tom Searle, who focused on political and [...] "bigger picture" [...] themes. Carter described [...] "Devil's Island" [...] as [...] "one of the hardest songs to write" [...] because of the prominence of its theme of rioting. Searle, who focused on its lyrics, said, [...] "With money firmly ingrained into <b>our</b> <b>global</b> society we really need to look to alternative solutions when problems like the riots occur because violence is never the solution". Carter said [...] "Black Blood", which was included on the re-release, is about the oil industry, society's strong dependence on oil and the way [...] "short term profit is the only thing these people think about, instead of the longevity of what we really could do and how we could stabilize what's really {{going on in the world}} right now".|$|E

500|$|World federalists often {{point out}} that a {{democratic}} union of peoples, rather than governments, {{is suggested by the}} opening words of the Preamble to the United Nations Charter, [...] "We the peoples ..." [...] This sentiment was expressed by Theo van Boven, who said, [...] "A more democratic United Nations as envisaged by the campaign for a UN Parliament will strengthen the legitimacy of We the peoples of the United Nations in whose name the UN Charter was proclaimed." [...] According to the Committee for a Democratic UN, [...] "The UNPA concept is the a first step towards a democratic world parliament". World federalists typically view an empowered democratic assembly as a means of preventing war by providing everyone a peaceful means of pursuing their political objectives. Walter Cronkite, for instance, said, [...] "Within the next few years, we must change the basic structure of <b>our</b> <b>global</b> community from the present anarchic system of war and ever more destructive weaponry to a new system governed by a democratic U.N. federation." ...|$|E

Furthermore, Paterson recorded an unreleased, alternate version of the music video, shot with an 8 mm camera. Writer David Noh, described it as, [...] "grainy, overexposed, and sexy as shit". According to Paterson, [...] "Michael loved it, but Sony hated it and refused to release it". The New York Times described the United States promotional effort for the Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix campaign as [...] "subdued", creating [...] "hardly a sound" [...] and [...] "perplexing to {{many people in the}} industry". Jackson's label Epic Records, refuted allegations they were not promoting the album sufficiently, saying, [...] "We are completely behind the album... Michael is certainly one of our superstars and is treated as such... We just went into this one with <b>our</b> <b>global</b> hats on". The New York Times acknowledged that promotion was stronger internationally, where Jackson had more commercial force and popularity.|$|E

[...] Thirty Seconds to Mars then signed a new contract with EMI. Leto said that the band had [...] "resolved our differences with EMI" [...] and the decision had been made because of [...] "the willingness and enthusiasm by EMI to address our major concerns and issues, [...] the opportunity to return to work with a team so committed and passionate about Thirty Seconds to Mars."

MSN product manager Lisa Gurry stated that the project [...] "didn't really map to <b>our</b> <b>global</b> branding objectives". Microsoft again apologized for the miscommunication stating [...] "the confusion over the legitimacy of this effort was caused by people moving too quickly and who misspoke before gathering all of the relevant information". Prior to the cancellation, an iLoo prototype was in the [...] "early stages of construction". MSN allows regional units to design their own marketing campaigns, and the UK division had developed a reputation for innovative campaigns, in this case involving British toilet humour.
