5|$|The {{electronic}} music of Kid A and Amnesiac {{was inspired by}} Yorke's admiration for {{electronic music}} exemplified by Warp Records artists such as Aphex Twin; in 2013, Yorke named Aphex Twin as his biggest influence. The album also samples early computer music. The jazz of Charles Mingus, Alice Coltrane and Miles Davis, and 1970s krautrock bands such as Can and Neu!, were other major influences during this period. Jonny Greenwood's interest in 20th century classical music also had a role, as the influence of composers Krzysztof Penderecki and Olivier Messiaen was apparent; since the recording of Kid A, Greenwood has played the <b>ondes</b> Martenot, an early electronic instrument popularised by Messiaen.|$|E
25|$|Unusual for the time, an LP {{recording}} of Elmer Bernstein's score was released alongside the soundtrack in 1981, and it featured the composer's {{first use of}} the <b>ondes</b> Martenot, an instrument which became a trademark of Bernstein's later career. On March 13, 2008, Film Score Monthly released an official, expanded CD release of Bernstein's score, which he conducted. The score was performed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra with the London Voices and Jeanne Loriod on the <b>ondes</b> Martenot.|$|E
25|$|Developments of {{the vacuum}} tube led to {{electronic}} instruments that were smaller, amplified, and more practical for performance. In particular, the theremin, <b>ondes</b> Martenot and trautonium were commercially {{produced by the}} early 1930s.|$|E

25|$|Léon Theremin was a Russian inventor, {{most famous}} for his {{invention}} of the theremin around 1919–1920, {{one of the first}} electronic musical instruments. The <b>Ondes</b> Martenot is another early example of an electronic musical instrument.|$|E
25|$|In 1928, Varèse {{returned}} to Paris to alter {{one of the}} parts in Amériques to include the recently constructed <b>ondes</b> Martenot. Around 1930, he composed his most famous non-electronic piece entitled Ionisation, the first to feature solely percussion instruments. Although it was composed with pre-existing instruments, Ionisation was an exploration of new sounds and methods to create them.|$|E
25|$|Other {{controllers}} include theremin, lightbeam controllers, touch buttons (touche d’intensité) on the <b>ondes</b> Martenot, {{and various}} types of foot pedals. Envelope following systems, the most sophisticated being the vocoder, are controlled by the power or amplitude of input audio signal. A musician uses the talk box to manipulate sound using the vocal tract, though it is rarely categorized as a synthesizer.|$|E

25|$|Poincaré {{made clear}} the {{importance}} of {{paying attention to the}} invariance of laws of physics under different transformations, and was the first to present the Lorentz transformations in their modern symmetrical form. Poincaré discovered the remaining relativistic velocity transformations and recorded them in a letter to Dutch physicist Hendrik Lorentz (1853–1928) in 1905. Thus he obtained perfect invariance of all of Maxwell's equations, an important step in the formulation of the theory of special relativity. In 1905, Poincaré first proposed gravitational waves (<b>ondes</b> gravifiques) emanating from a body and propagating {{at the speed of light}} as being required by the Lorentz transformations.|$|E
25|$|Radiohead {{began work}} on Kid A in Paris in January 1999 with OK Computer {{producer}} Nigel Godrich and no deadline. Yorke, who had the greatest control in the band, was still facing writer's block. His new songs were incomplete, and some consisted of little more than sounds or drum machine rhythms; few had clear verses or choruses. Instead of working as a traditional rock band, Radiohead experimented with electronic instruments including modular synthesisers and the <b>ondes</b> Martenot, an early theremin-like electronic instrument. Godrich and the band used software such as Pro Tools and Cubase to edit and manipulate their recordings.|$|E
25|$|There is a Circe {{episode in}} John Harbison's Ulysses (Act 1, scene 2, 1983) {{in which the}} song of the enchantress is {{represented}} by <b>ondes</b> Martenot and tuned percussion. After the sailors of Ullyses are transformed into animals by her spell, a battle of wills follows between Circe and the hero. Though the men are changed back, Ulysses is charmed by her in his turn. In 1993, a full scale treatment of the story followed in 's 2-act Circe und Odysseus. Also psychological in intent, it represents Circe's seduction of the restless hero as ultimately unsuccessful. The part played by the geometrical set in its Berlin production was particularly notable.|$|E

25|$|Kid A is {{the fourth}} studio album by the English rock band Radiohead, {{released}} on 2 October 2000 by Parlophone. On {{the verge of a}} breakdown after promoting Radiohead's 1997 album OK Computer, songwriter Thom Yorke envisioned a radical change in direction. Radiohead replaced their rock sound with synthesisers, drum machines, the <b>ondes</b> Martenot, string orchestras and brass instruments. They incorporated influences from genres such as electronic music, krautrock, jazz, and 20th-century classical music. They recorded Kid A with OK Computer producer Nigel Godrich in Paris, Copenhagen, Gloucestershire and their hometown Oxford, England. The sessions produced over 20 tracks, and Radiohead split the work in two albums: Kid A and Amnesiac. The latter was released the following year.|$|E
25|$|Boulez earned {{money by}} giving {{mathematics}} lessons to his landlord's son. He also played the <b>ondes</b> Martenot (an early electronic instrument), improvising accompaniments to radio dramas and occasionally deputising {{in the pit}} orchestra of the Folies Bergère. In early 1946 the actor and director Jean-Louis Barrault needed someone to play the instrument for a production of Hamlet for the new company he and his wife, Madeleine Renaud, had formed. Honegger suggested Boulez. He was soon appointed Music Director of the Compagnie Renaud-Barrault, a post he held for nine years. He arranged and conducted incidental music, mostly by composers {{with whom he had}} little affinity (such as Milhaud and Tchaikovsky), but it gave him the chance to work with professional musicians, whilst leaving him time to compose during the day. It also broadened his horizons: in 1947 the company toured to Belgium and Switzerland ("absolutely pays de cocagne , my first discovery of the big world"); in 1948 they took their production of Hamlet to the second Edinburgh International Festival; in 1951 they gave a season of plays at St James's Theatre in London at the invitation of Laurence Olivier; and between 1950 and 1957 there were three tours to South America and two to North America. The music he wrote for the company was lost during the student occupation of the Théâtre de l'Odéon in 1968.|$|E
