5|$|The emperor penguin's dark plumage fades {{to brown}} from November until February (the Antarctic summer), before the yearly moult in January and February. Moulting is rapid in this species {{compared}} with other birds, taking only around 34days. Emperor penguin feathers emerge from the skin after they have grown {{to a third of}} their total length, and before old feathers are lost, to help reduce heat loss. New feathers then push <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> ones before finishing their growth.|$|E
5|$|Elephants {{usually have}} 26 teeth: the incisors, {{known as the}} tusks, 12 {{deciduous}} premolars, and 12 molars. Unlike most mammals, which grow baby teeth and then replace them with a single permanent set of adult teeth, elephants are polyphyodonts that have cycles of tooth rotation throughout their lives. The chewing teeth are replaced six times in a typical elephant's lifetime. Teeth are not replaced by new ones emerging from the jaws vertically as in most mammals. Instead, new teeth grow in {{at the back of}} the mouth and move forward to push <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> ones. The first chewing tooth on each side of the jaw falls out when the elephant is two to three years old. The second set of chewing teeth falls out when the elephant is four to six years old. The third set is lost at 9–15 years of age, and set four lasts until 18–28 years of age. The fifth set of teeth lasts until the elephant is in its early 40s. The sixth (and usually final) set must last the elephant the rest of its life. Elephant teeth have loop-shaped dental ridges, which are thicker and more diamond-shaped in African elephants.|$|E

25|$|Despite the pleas of many pagans for tolerance, Honorius and Arcadius {{continued}} {{the work of}} their father by enacting even more anti-paganism laws to stop any revival of paganism. The {{fact that they had}} to keep repeating their threats by the enactment of numerous laws against the practice of paganism indicates that their efforts did not succeed in stamping <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> religion, which continued to be practiced discreetly.|$|E
25|$|The {{numerous}} {{laws against}} pagans {{seems to have}} had only limited immediate effect in stamping <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> religion. Many people simply conformed outwardly and pretended to become Christian while secretly continuing to practice their beliefs. The numerous laws against apostasy, that had been continuously promulgated since the time of Gratian and Theodosius, is evidence that the emperors were having a hard time even keeping Christians from going astray.|$|E

25|$|As Africanized bees migrate into regions, hives {{with an old}} {{or absent}} queen can become hybridized by cross-breeding. The {{aggressive}} Africanized drones outcompete European drones for a newly developed queen of such hive, ultimately resulting in hybridization of the existing colony. Requeening, a term for swapping <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> queen with a new, already fertilized one, can reduce hybridization in apiaries. As a prophylactic measure, the majority of beekeepers in North America tend to requeen their hives annually, maintaining strong colonies and avoiding hybridization.|$|E
25|$|European modellers {{have the}} option to convert the {{couplings}} on their rolling stock to the Fleischmann Profi-Coupler system for more reliable operation should they wish to do so, but most N scale rolling stock continues to be manufactured with Rapido couplers - a design which is fairly robust and easy to mold. Modern N scale stock uses a standard NEM socket for couplers which allows different coupling designs to be used by simply pulling <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> coupler and fitting a new one of a different design. In the United Kingdom, vendors are increasingly shipping both NEM sockets for couplers and buckeye (knuckle) couplers.|$|E
25|$|During {{the years}} since B bankruptcy, highway {{congestion}} has increased significantly, resulting in growing demand for passenger and freight options. During this time frame, the MBTA has been slowly investing in some infrastructure changes in its rail operations. In 1995 a new North Station was opened. In 2001 it opened the Anderson Regional Transportation Center on the Boston & Lowell to centralize ridership and provide a superstation with convenient access to Interstates 93 and 95 (Route 128). In southern Maine, frustration with bus service drove the state to explore restarting passenger service, resulting in contracting with Amtrak to operate the Downeaster, which runs from North Station to Haverhill and up to Portland. Due to scheduling conflicts with the MBTA, the Downeaster runs up the Lowell Line to Wilmington and then <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> B Wildcat Branch to the Haverhill/Reading Line. This route allows the Downeaster to pass a commuter train on the Haverhill/Reading Line without schedule conflicts. The route is also historically significant {{because it is the}} same route that the original B used to Portland.|$|E

25|$|Rijkaard had {{a disappointing}} start at Barcelona that saw some {{sections}} of the club's fans call for his resignation, and he drew flak from the media when the team lost to Real Madrid in December 2003. Rijkaard's resilience won through and from 2004 onwards, he achieved a massive turnaround, as the team went from strength to strength. Barcelona finished runners-up in La Liga in 2003–04, having been close to the relegation zone {{at one point in}} the earlier stages of the season. Rijkaard then took Barcelona to the next level as he phased <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> guard and rebuilt a new-look side around Ronaldinho, with new players like Deco, Samuel Eto'o, Rafael Márquez and Ludovic Giuly, along with the latest promotion of some young players from the previous era trained in the club's youth teams, including Víctor Valdés and Andrés Iniesta. He eventually succeeded in turning around the fortunes of the club, with the strong support of Laporta, and within the next couple of years finally managed to win La Liga both in 2004–05 and in 2005–06.|$|E
500|$|O'Donnell {{has used}} an Apple Macintosh {{computer}} for composition. In an interview O'Donnell wished that his software would easily upgrade to newer revisions; [...] "for {{the last twenty}} years of technology, every time a 'new' version of something comes <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> version gets trashed and I find myself unable to do something that I used to depend on," [...] he said. O'Donnell was involved in the implementation of his music as well as the composition, and was Bungie's Audio lead. He composed at Bungie from a sound-proofed room in the corner of Bungie's office, dubbed the [...] "Ivory Tower".|$|E
500|$|Harrison {{took the}} lyrics to [...] "Ding Dong" [...] from {{engravings}} he found at his nineteenth-century home, Friar Park, in Oxfordshire – a legacy of its eccentric founder, Frank Crisp. The song's [...] "Ring <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>old,</b> ring in the new" [...] refrain has invited interpretation as Harrison distancing himself from his past {{as a member of}} the Beatles, and as the singer farewelling his first marriage, to Pattie Boyd. As on much of the Dark Horse album, Harrison's vocals on the recording were hampered by a throat condition, due partly to his having overextended himself on business projects such as his recently launched record label, Dark Horse Records. Recorded at his Friar Park studio, the track includes musical contributions from Tom Scott, Ringo Starr, Alvin Lee, Ron Wood and Jim Keltner.|$|E

500|$|Authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter {{describe}} [...] "Ding Dong" [...] as the [...] "quickest song" [...] that Harrison ever wrote, {{in terms}} of time spent on the composition. The words for the song's middle eight – [...] "Yesterday, today was tomorrow / And tomorrow, today will be yesterday" [...] – came from another pair of inscriptions from Crisp's time at Friar Park. Harrison found these lines in what he called [...] "the garden building", carved in stone around two matching windows. The only other lyrics in [...] "Ding Dong, Ding Dong" [...] are the song title, repeated four times to serve as its chorus. Sung in imitation of a clock chiming, the chorus lyrics, combined with the message of those of the verse, lend the composition an obvious New Year's theme. Harrison later described the song as [...] "very optimistic", and suggested: [...] "Instead of getting stuck in a rut, everybody should try ringing <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> and ringing in the new… [...] sing about it, but they never apply it to their lives." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the most}} part, the long passage across the Weddell Sea {{proceeded}} uneventfully. There was a growing level of unrest among the crew, perhaps provoked by disappointment with the apparent aimlessness of the voyage; Worsley {{in particular was}} critical of Wild's leadership. Wild, in his own account, dealt with this discontent {{by the threat of}} [...] "the most drastic treatment". On 12 March they reached 64°11'S, 46°4'W, which was the area where Ross had recorded an [...] "Appearance of Land" [...] in 1842, {{but there was no sign}} of it, and a depth sounding of over 2,300fathoms (13,800ft, 4,200m.) indicated no likelihood of land nearby. Between 15–21 March Quest was frozen into the ice, and the shortage of coal became a major concern. Wild hoped that the diminished fuel supply could be supplemented by blubber from the seals at Elephant Island. On 25 March the island was sighted. Wild wanted if possible to revisit Cape Wild, the site of the old Endurance expedition camp, but bad weather prevented this. They viewed the site through binoculars, picking <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> landmarks, before landing on the western coast to hunt for elephant seals. They were able to obtain sufficient blubber to mix with the coal so that, aided by a favourable wind, they reached South Georgia on 6 April.|$|E
500|$|George Harrison {{purchased}} the 33-acre Friar Park estate, in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, in January 1970, and soon afterwards composed [...] "Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let It Roll)" [...] {{as a tribute}} to the property's original owner, an eccentric Victorian lawyer and horticulturalist named Frank Crisp. Harrison included the song on his All Things Must Pass triple album, released in November 1970, by which time he had begun incorporating into his new compositions some of the homilies and aphorisms that Crisp had inscribed around the property, 70 or more years before. A four-line verse beginning [...] "Scan not a friend with a microscopic glass" [...] particularly resonated with Harrison, who eventually used it in his 1975 song [...] "The Answer's at the End". It similarly took Harrison several years to turn two inspirational lines of verse from carvings in the house's drawing room into song lyrics. These lines provided the repeated verse in [...] "Ding Dong, Ding Dong": [...] "Ring <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>old,</b> ring in the new" [...] – which he took from the carving {{to the left of the}} fireplace – and [...] "Ring out the false, ring in the true" [...] – from the one to the right. In his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine, Harrison credits English poet Lord Tennyson as the original source for these lines.|$|E

500|$|The {{work was}} {{completed}} {{at a cost}} of £12,081 and the prisoners were transferred in January 1817. Bellerophon generally held around 435 prisoners during her time in this role, although in 1823 changes in legislation resulted in the adult prisoners being transferred out of Bellerophon and the ship instead being used to house boy prisoners, with 320 arriving in early 1824. In 1824 the decision was taken to rename , an 80-gun ship launched in 1818, HMS Bellerophon. To free the name, the former HMS Bellerophon was renamed Captivity on 5 October 1824. [...] She continued as a prison ship for boys until early 1826, when it was decided that the arrangement of the internal spaces made her unsuitable for workshops. The boys were transferred to another hulk, the former , and it was decided to move Captivity to Plymouth. The ship was taken into Sheerness Dockyard in April 1826, and was fitted out for the journey to Plymouth. She arrived there in June and spent the last eight years of her working existence as a convict hulk in Plymouth. By 1834 the rate of penal transportation had been drastically increased to clear <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> hulks. When the last convicts had left Captivity, she was handed back to the Navy Department, who put her up for sale.|$|E
