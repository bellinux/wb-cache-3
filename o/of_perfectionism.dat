In this capacity, he purposefully embarrassed PNL Foreign Minister Ion I. C. Brătianu by not sending in all Legation employees to receive him during an official visit. During his return trips to Romania, Filitti was focusing on researching his own family archives, and, in 1910, published the volume Așezământul cultural al mitropolitului Dositei Filitti, de la înființare până azi ("Metropolitan Dositei Filitti's Cultural Foundation, from Its Establishment to the Present Day"). In researching this work, Filitti sought input from the genealogical school in Greece and Macedonia, and from Romanian diplomats working in Istanbul. In a show <b>of</b> <b>perfectionism,</b> Filitti constantly revised the work as new data surfaced, and, in 1936, declared the 1910 edition to be entirely unusable.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Monroe {{gained a}} {{reputation}} for being difficult on film sets; the difficulties worsened as her career progressed. She was often late or did not show up at all, did not remember her lines, and would demand several re-takes before she was satisfied with her performance. Monroe's dependence on her acting coaches—first Natasha Lytess and later Paula Strasberg—also irritated directors. Monroe's problems have been attributed to a combination <b>of</b> <b>perfectionism,</b> low self-esteem, and stage fright; she disliked the lack of control she had on her work on film sets, and never experienced similar problems during photo shoots, in which she had more say over her performance and could be more spontaneous instead of following a script. To alleviate her anxiety and chronic insomnia, she began to use barbiturates, amphetamines and alcohol, which also exacerbated her problems, although she did not become severely addicted until 1956. According to Sarah Churchwell, some of Monroe's behavior especially later in her career was also in response to the condescension and sexism of her male co-stars and directors. Similarly, Lois Banner has stated that she was bullied by many of her directors.|$|E

This article presents the first systematic investigation <b>of</b> multidimensional <b>perfectionism</b> {{in the domain of}} sexuality exploring the unique relationships that different forms <b>of</b> sexual <b>perfectionism</b> show with positive and negative aspects of sexuality. A sample of 272 university students (52 male, 220 female) completed measures of four forms of sexual perfectionism: self-oriented, partner-oriented, partner-prescribed, and socially prescribed. In addition, they completed measures of sexual esteem, sexual self-efficacy, sexual optimism, sex life satisfaction (capturing positive aspects of sexuality) and sexual problem self-blame, sexual anxiety, sexual depression, and negative sexual perfectionism cognitions during sex (capturing negative aspects). Results showed unique patterns of relationships for the four forms <b>of</b> sexual <b>perfectionism,</b> suggesting that partner-prescribed and socially prescribed sexual perfectionism are maladaptive forms <b>of</b> sexual <b>perfectionism</b> associated with negative aspects of sexuality whereas self-oriented and partner-oriented sexual perfectionism emerged as ambivalent forms associated with positive and negative aspects...|$|R
40|$|The {{construct}} <b>of</b> clinical <b>perfectionism,</b> {{conceptualized as}} a one-dimensional construct (Shafran, Cooper, & Fairburn, 2003), has drawn considerable debate {{because of the}} associated critique <b>of</b> multidimensional <b>perfectionism’s</b> relevance for clinical theory and research. Hence Dickie, Surgenor, Wilson, and McDowall’s (2012) finding that the Clinical Perfectionism Questionnaire (CPQ), designed to measure clinical perfectionism, was two-factorial and thus multidimensional makes {{an important contribution to}} the debate. The present study aimed to replicate Dickie et al. ’s finding examining the CPQ’s factorial structure in 316 university students. In addition, the study examined the CPQ’s convergent correlations with dispositional perfectionism, perfectionism cognitions, and perfectionistic self-presentation. CPQ total scores showed large-sized positive correlations with dispositional perfectionism and perfectionism cognitions demonstrating convergent validity. However, the study confirmed that the CPQ was two-factorial with Factor 1 mainly capturing perfectionistic strivings and Factor 2 mainly capturing perfectionistic concerns, thus questioning the CPQ’s construct validity. Together with Dickie et al. ’s findings, the present study’s findings suggest that [...] if the CPQ is a valid measure <b>of</b> clinical <b>perfectionism</b> as conceptualized by Shafran et al.

500|$|Writers {{have pointed}} to the hand tremor that made writing {{difficult}} and to the alcoholism that afflicted him at numerous stages of his life. Others have argued that Sibelius's exalted status as a national hero effectively silenced him; he became afraid that any further major work would {{not live up to}} the expectations of the adoring nation. Andrew Barnett, another of the composer's many biographers, points to Sibelius's intense self-criticism; he would withhold or suppress anything that failed to meet his self-imposed standards: [...] "It was this attitude that brought about the destruction of the Eighth Symphony, but the very same trait forced him to keep on revising the Fifth until it was perfect." [...] The historian Mark McKenna agrees that Sibelius became stifled by a combination <b>of</b> <b>perfectionism</b> and increasing self-doubt. The myth, sustained for more than 15 years, that Sibelius was still working on the symphony was, according to McKenna, a deliberate fiction: [...] "To admit that he had stopped completely would be to admit the unthinkable—that he was no longer a composer".|$|E

All relationships were investigated cross-sectionally and over a 12 -week time interval. Participants completed measures <b>of</b> multidimensional sexual <b>perfectionism</b> (self-oriented, partner-oriented, partner-prescribed and socially prescribed), sexual anxiety, sexual problem self-blame, sexual esteem, and male or female sexual function at Time 1 (n = 464) and Time 2 (n = 213). Consistent with Stoeber et al. ’s (2013) findings, results revealed unique patterns of relationships for the four forms <b>of</b> sexual <b>perfectionism</b> and sexual anxiety, sexual problem self-blame, and sexual esteem. Furthermore, unique patterns of relationships were observed between the four forms <b>of</b> sexual <b>perfectionism</b> and aspects <b>of</b> female sexual function.

Importantly, partner-prescribed sexual perfectionism emerged as the most maladaptive form, predicting longitudinal increases in sexual anxiety and longitudinal decreases in sexual esteem in women. Furthermore, it predicted longitudinal decreases in male and female sexual function suggesting partner-prescribed sexual perfectionism is an important personality characteristic that contributes to lower levels of sexual function, warranting further research.

500|$|The {{band was}} not {{satisfied}} with the acoustics of the American studios they considered, and decided to record in Ulrich's native Denmark. Ulrich took drum lessons, and Hammett worked with Joe Satriani to learn how to record more efficiently. Ulrich was in talks with Rush's bassist and vocalist Geddy Lee to produce the album, but the collaboration never materialized because of uncoordinated schedules. Metallica recorded the album with producer Flemming Rasmussen at Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark, from September 1 to December 27, 1985. The writing of all the songs except [...] "Orion" [...] and [...] "The Thing That Should Not Be" [...] was completed before the band's arrival in Copenhagen. Rasmussen stated that the band brought well-prepared demos of the songs, and only slight changes were made to the compositions in the studio. The recording took longer than the previous album because Metallica had developed a sense <b>of</b> <b>perfectionism</b> and had higher ambitions for this one. Metallica eschewed the slick production and synthesizers of contemporary hard rock and heavy metal albums by Bon Jovi, Iron Maiden, and Judas Priest. Despite a reputation for drinking, the band stayed dry on recording days. Hammett recalled that the group was [...] "just making another album" [...] at the time and [...] "had no idea that the record would have such a range of influence that it went on to have". He also said that the group was [...] "definitely peaking" [...] at the time and that the album had [...] "the sound of a band really gelling, really learning how to work well together".|$|E

His primary opponents were his friend and former classmate Desmond Ford, for sixteen years head of the Department of Religion at Avondale College, Hans LaRondelle of the Seventh-day Adventist Theological Seminary at Andrews University, and Edward Heppenstall,. In the 1960s he advocated a form <b>of</b> <b>perfectionism</b> which he described as the [...] "Sanctuary Awakening" [...] or [...] "Awakening" [...] message. The [...] "sanctuary" [...] element referred to the distinctive Seventh-day Adventist theological understanding of events believed to have begun in the year 1844 in a heavenly sanctuary, of which the earthly sanctuary in the Old Testament was understood to be a figure and [...] "type". In contrast to legalistic perfectionism, Brinsmead believed that as Jesus finished his mediatorial work in the heavenly sanctuary prior to the second advent, a special outpouring of the Holy Spirit would perfect and seal believers and grant them the ability to live sinlessly {{without the need for}} a mediator. [...] In so doing, he moved the point of spiritual transformation of living believers at the end of earth's history from a moment at the Second Coming (along with the physical transformation described in 1 Corinthians 15), as believed by many Christians, to a unique event before it. [...] He claimed he was led to this position by the pre-advent judgment in Seventh-day Adventist eschatology.

40|$|Background and Objective: The goal of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the mediating role <b>of</b> self-concept in <b>perfectionism</b> and mental health. Materials and Methods: The sample group in this study included 400 high school students (200 boys and 200 girls) from Shiraz with the mean age of 16. 37 ± 0. 93 for the girls and 16. 12 ± 0. 63 for the boys. Data were gathered through the application of three scales: Mandaglio and Pyerist Self-concept Scale (P. M. S. P. S); Depression and Anxiety and Stress Scale of Lovibond and Lovibond (DASS- 21); and Negative and Positive <b>Perfectionism</b> Scale <b>of</b> Terri-Short et. al. The validity and reliability of these scales were reviewed during this study.    Results: The result of the Path analysis test showed the mediating role <b>of</b> self-concept in <b>perfectionism</b> and mental health. This analysis illustrated that negative and positive perfectionism, both in a direct and indirect way, had a significant role in mental health. The rate of the direct effect <b>of</b> positive <b>perfectionism</b> on mental health was 0. 17 (p value < 0. 001) and the rate of the indirect variable through self-concept was 0. 06 (p value < 0. 001).

First, to assess perfectionism {{dimensions}} in obsessive-compulsive disorder and eating disorders in comparison with psychiatric control (depression/anxiety) and non-clinical control groups. Second, to examine if perfectionism is specifically related to these different clinical conditions. METHOD: Thirty-nine outpatients with obsessive-compulsive disorder, 24 outpatients with eating disorders, 65 outpatients with a diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety, and 70 non-clinical participants completed the Portuguese version <b>of</b> the Multidimensional <b>Perfectionism</b> Scale. RESULTS: Compared to non-clinical subjects, individuals of all clinical samples had significantly higher scores on Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale total score, Self-Oriented and Socially-Prescribed Perfectionism.

40|$|Background: Psychological perfectionism, from a {{clinical}} perspective, {{started to be}} a topic of interest for cognitive behavioural clinicians {{at the beginning of}} the 1950 s. Whilst many studies have identified perfectionism as a pivotal motivator in different conditions of neurosis, the exact nature of its interactions remains unclear. In the research community there is still a debate as to whether there is such a thing as good perfectionism, and there remains no consensual theory <b>of</b> psychopathological <b>perfectionism.</b> Aims: The aim of the study was to investigate why the nature of the phenomena remains a contentious issue, and to develop a robust theory <b>of</b> psychopathological <b>perfectionism,</b> within a cognitive behavioural framework, which will find general acceptance. From the literature review this appears to be the first qualitative study to develop such a theory. Method: Substantive grounded theory was developed within a framework of methodical hermeneutics which, it is argued, is capable of generating formative theory. 20 volunteers who came forward in response to advertisements became participants in semi-structured interviews using a post classic qualitative methodology, from which emerging data became the basis of categories leading to the development of the theory, and functions of the phenomena. Results and Conclusions: The study sets out reasons why there remains an impasse amongst researchers and clinicians about the condition <b>of</b> psychopathological <b>perfectionism.</b> A parsimonious theory <b>of</b> pathological <b>perfectionism</b> has been developed, the constructs of which are just necessary and sufficient to describe the condition. The developed theory makes a contribution to theories proposed prior to 1990 and to contemporary research. However as with all theories it is necessarily provisional, so that its usefulness is in need of further research and development. Psychopathological perfectionism has only two constructs, namely a demand to achieve perfectionism in at least one idiosyncratic sphere, which is in response to a core schema of conditional worth. A number of symptoms or functions <b>of</b> psychopathological <b>perfectionism</b> have also been identified, and there are suggestions as to how the condition develops and is maintained to the detriment of the sufferer. The study synthesizes over fifty years of theory and research into the phenomena. The developed theory and its symptoms or functions have important implications for clinical interventions, training, and for further psychological and psychosocial research. These implications are discussed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
