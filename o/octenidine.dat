40|$|Purpose: Bacterial vaginosis is a {{recalcitrant}} polymicrobial biofilm {{infection that}} often resists standard antibiotic treatment. We therefore considered repeated treatment with <b>octenidine,</b> a local antiseptic that {{has previously been}} shown to be highly effective in several biofilm-associated infections. Methods: Twenty-four patients with recurrent BV were treated with a 7 -day course of <b>octenidine</b> (<b>octenidine</b> dihydrochloride spray application with the commercial product Octenisept). In case of treatment failure or relapse within 6 months, patients were re-treated with a 28 -day course of <b>octenidine.</b> In case of recurrence within 6 months after the second treatment course, patients were treated again with a 28 -day course followed by weekly applications for 2 months. Treatment effect was evaluated by assessment of the presence of the biofilm on voided vaginal epithelial cells through fluorescence in situ hybridisation. Results: The initial cure rate following a 7 -day course of <b>octenidine</b> was as high as 87. 5 %. The 6 -month relapse rate was, however, as high as 66. 6 %.

Materials and Methods: Seventy human mandibularfirst premolars were used and 140 longitudinal dentin slices were obtained from them. Each sample was irrigated with of 3 % sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), simulating the irrigation used during the chemomechanical preparation and then washed with 10 ml of distilled water (DW). The samples were then divided into seven groups of 20 samples each. Group 1 :NaOCl + DW, Group 2 : QMix + DW, Group 3 : 0. 1 % <b>octenidine</b> hydrochloride + DW, Group 4 :Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) + DW + NaOCl + DW, Group 5 : EDTA + DW + QMix + DW, Group 6 : EDTA + DW + 0. 1 % <b>Octenidine</b> Hydrochloride + DW, and Group 7 (control) : DW. The contact angle between AH Plus and the samples was measured using Rame Hart Goniometer followed by statistical analysis of data. Results: Values of contact angle was least when samples were treated with QMix followed by treatment with 0. 1 % <b>Octenidine</b> Hydrochloride followed by 3 % NaOCl.

40|$|Abstract Background A {{water based}} {{combination}} of 0. 1 % <b>octenidine</b> dihydrochloride and 2 % 2 - phenoxyethanol is registered in many European countries as an antiseptic solution (octenisept ®) for topical treatment with high antimicrobial activity for human use, but <b>octenidine</b> based products {{have not been}} registered for veterinary use yet. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate whether <b>octenidine</b> dihydrochloride or 2 -phenoxyethanol, the two main components of this disinfectant, permeate through animal skin in vitro. Therefore, permeation studies were conducted using Franz-type diffusion cells. 2 ml of the test compound were applied onto 1. 77 cm 2 split skin of cats, dogs, cows and horses. To simulate wounded skin, cattle skin was treated with adhesive tapes 100 times, as well. Up to an incubation time of 28 hours samples of the acceptor chamber were taken and were analysed by UV-HPLC. Using the method of the external standard, the apparent permeability coefficient, the flux J max, and the recovery were calculated. Furthermore, the residues of both components in the skin samples were determined after completion of the diffusion experiment. Results After 28 hours no <b>octenidine</b> dihydrochloride was found in the receptor chamber of intact skin samples, while 2. 7 % of the topical applied <b>octenidine</b> dihydrochloride permeated through barrier disrupted cattle skin. 2 - phenoxyethanol permeated through all skin samples with the highest permeability in equine, followed by bovine, canine to feline skin. Furthermore, both components were found in the stratum corneum and the dermis of all split skin samples with different amounts in the examined species. Conclusion For 2 -phenoxyethanol the systemic impact of the high absorption rate and a potential toxicological risk have to be investigated in further studies. Due to its low absorption rates through the skin, <b>octenidine</b> dihydrochloride is suitable for superficial skin treatment in the examined species. </p...|$|E

An analysis on how wound cleansers can be used to debride the wound surface without damaging healthy cells is also detailed. This is followed by a series of 18 case studies showing the use of Octenilin Wound Gel and Octenilin Wound Irrigation Solution on non-healing and/or infected or critically colonised non-healing wounds of different wound types including: diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers and pressure ulcers, among others...|$|E
40|$|MRSA-infected or -colonized {{staff can}} be a vector for {{transmission}} between patients. Therefore, reliable detection and rapid decolonisation of carriers is important. Literature {{on the effectiveness of}} MRSA decolonization regimes is very heterogeneous. Existing studies differ distinct in design, endpoints and patient populations studied and are therefore hard to compare. This paper summarizes routine data from decolonization treatment of MRSA-positive staff and relatives from March 2007 –March 2009 at the University Hospital of Greifswald. From a total of 107 persons rated, 98. 1 % were successfully decolonized. In 73 cases (68 %) decolonization was achieved in the first cycle. This shows the high effectiveness of regimes based on <b>octenidine</b> containing antiseptic preparations as part of a structured decolonization concepts...|$|E
40|$|After {{debridement}} {{and before}} dressing a wound with maggots of calliphorid fies, one frequently performed step is {{the application of}} antiseptics to the prepared wound bed. However, the concomitant application of antiseptic agents during maggot therapy is regarded controversial as antiseptics may interfere with maggots’ viability. In this experimental in vitro study, the viability of fy maggots was investigated after exposure to various antiseptics frequently used in wound care. Here, we show that Lucilia sericata fy maggots can survive up to an hour’s exposure to wound antiseptics such as <b>octenidine,</b> povidone-iodine or polihexanide. Concomitant short-term application of wound antiseptics together with maggots on wound beds is tolerated by larvae and does not impair their viability...|$|E
40|$|Background The use of {{vascular}} access devices (VADs) may put {{patients at}} risk for bloodstream infections. Despite infection control prevention methods used in our neonatal unit, mean catheter-related blood stream infection (CRBSI) rates are quite high. One contributing factor for these high infection rates may be the skin antiseptic preparation procedure undertaken prior to intravenous line insertion. Objectives We aimed to reduce CRBRBSI rates by changing to <b>octenidine</b> hydrochloride antiseptic solutions for skin preparation in the neonatal unit at Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital. Methods Antiseptics for skin preparation were changed from povidone-iodine or alcohol to <b>octenidine</b> hydrochloride from September to November 2010. Bloodstream infection rates and hand hygiene compliance were recorded and compared {{before and during the}} study. Results The mean CRBRBSI rate in the neonatal unit before changing the skin antiseptic solution (January – August 2010) was 11. 68 ‰ (‰ means per 1000 patient-days). During the study, CRBSI rates decreased significantly to 1. 1 ‰ in the first month, increased to 8. 7 ‰ in the second month, and decreased to 2. 4 ‰ in the third month. Hand hygiene compliance for 1 moment (before aseptic task) fluctuated, reaching 93. 8 % and 100 % before and during the study, respectively. Compliance for the remaining 4 moments of hand hygiene as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), ranged from 33. 0 – 87. 3 % before the study and 8. 0 – 100. 0 % during the study. The most striking decrease in these 4 moments of hand hygiene compliance in the second month was accompanied by a marked increase in CRB SI rate. Conclusions Reduced CRB SI rates cannot be attained by solely changing antiseptic solutions for skin preparation. Maintaining other prevention strategies, such as adhering to the 5 moments of hand hygiene recommended by WHO is also very important...|$|E
40|$|Iodophore are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used antiseptics and scrubbing agents and were of important support to implement the renaissance of antisepsis. In the beginning of the 1980 s there were no alternative antiseptic agents in place. However, at that time experts already requested a risk-benefit analysis of PVP-iodine due to possible harmful side effects. In these days there are other antiseptics established demonstrating a better therapeutic index due to a favourable balance between microbicidal efficacy and side effects. Moreover, these antiseptics (i. e. <b>octenidine</b> and polihexanide) will not be absorbed unlike iodophores. Iodophores are able to induce thyroid disorders since there is a considerable ability to absorb iodine through skin, mucous membranes and wounds. This article summarizes the current knowledge of indications and contraindications as well as provides a risk-benefit analysis of using iodophores as antiseptics...|$|E
