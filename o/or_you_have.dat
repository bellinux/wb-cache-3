In {{an interview with}} New York Magazine, Victor Fresco, the show's creator, was asked why he thought the show didn't catch on. He responded, [...] "I think not enough people knew about it. It wasn’t like {{we had a lot}} of people watch it and they didn’t come back to it. If anything, I think we were building slowly, but to me the way TV works is you spend a lot of money advertising and promoting, <b>or</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to let a show stay some place for a long period of time and an audience slowly comes to it.

500|$|Robert L. Surtees, who {{had already}} filmed several of the most {{successful}} epics of the 1950s, was hired as cinematographer for the film. Early on in the film's production, Zimbalist and other MGM executives made the decision to film the picture in a widescreen format. Wyler strongly disliked the widescreen format, commenting that [...] "Nothing is out of the picture, and you can't fill it. You either have a lot of empty space, <b>or</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> two people talking and a flock of others surrounding them who {{have nothing to do with}} the scene. Your eye just wanders out of curiosity." [...] The cameras were also quite large, heavy, and difficult and time-consuming to move. To overcome these difficulties, Surtees and Wyler collaborated on using the widescreen lenses, film stocks, and projection technologies to create highly detailed images for the film. Wyler was best known for composition in depth, a visual technique in which people, props, and architecture are not merely composed horizontally but in depth of field as well. He also had a strong preference for long takes, during which his actors could move within this highly detailed space.|$|E
