500|$|After the campaign, {{it emerged}} that Agnew {{had failed to}} report three alleged {{attempts}} to bribe him, made {{on behalf of the}} slot-machine industry, involving sums of $20,000, $75,000 and $200,000, if he would promise not to veto legislation keeping the machines legal in Southern Maryland. He justified his silence on the grounds that no actual offer had been made: [...] "Nobody sat down in front <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> a suitcase of money." [...] Agnew was also criticized over his part-ownership of land close to the site of a planned, but never-built second bridge over Chesapeake Bay. Opponents claimed a conflict of interest, since some of Agnew's partners in the venture were simultaneously involved in business deals with the county. Agnew denied any conflict or impropriety, saying that the property involved was outside Baltimore County and his jurisdiction. Nevertheless, he sold his interest.|$|E
500|$|The Diane Martel-directed {{music video}} for [...] "Love Sex Magic" [...] premiered on March 22, 2009. In an {{interview}} with MTV News, Ciara said: [...] "It's all about showing another side <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> this video. I'm basically giving you a show you'd see in Vegas—and it's my love, sex and magic show. He's the voyeur and I play with him a little bit. I got my inspiration from the Crazy Horse show and just from the shows , period. It's giving you the elements of love and sex and magic." [...] In a later interview about the video, Ciara stated {{that she had to}} lick Timberlake's ear, and at one point, he was licking her neck and they were [...] "freestyling." [...] Martel wanted them to do something [...] "edgy," [...] so they found a [...] "cool way to do it." [...] Ciara noted the different pauses in cuts in between the tapings, commenting [...] "so it's licking on the neck, again, then his biting on my neck, again. It was really funny." [...] The singer would later elaborate on the Crazy Horse show reference in {{an interview with}} Blues & Soul, explaining that she had so much respect for the show that it became her reference. On working with Timberlake, she said, [...] "Justin {{is one of the most}} easy-going, down-to-earth, hard-working and passionate artists you could ever work with. And, with both me and him, our goal was just to make the best video we could possibly make together, and to give the fans something a little fun and a little unexpected." ...|$|E
2500|$|Blaming {{herself for}} the album's {{commercial}} results, Norwood dismissed the album as [...] "too pop." [...] With her team wanting to produce a crossover album, Norwood had felt pressured {{to come up with}} different songs. Commenting on this decision, she later elaborated: [...] "I was listening to the voice of my team more so than {{what was going on inside}} <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> <b>With</b> Human, I felt like I wanted to do more R music and that’s not what we decided to do on that album." [...] The debut season of her 2010 VH1 reality series [...] further revealed that the album's underperformance resulted in another argument between her and executive producer Rodney Jerkins, whose commitment to the project Norwood felt not as [...] "creative and forthcoming" [...] as on previous albums and that he purposefully did not put his best work in the album. Jerkins had distanced himself from the project following its official release, declaring his dissatisfaction with the involvement of other producers on the album.|$|E

Commenting on his Twitter, Rose stated [...] "I'd like to thank the Rock N' Roll Hall of Fame and our fans. This is your victory". Commenting on the induction during his That Metal Show interview he said [...] "I don't know what it means in terms <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> the old band and the old lineup,"..."If we were to be invited, I don't know what they would ask of me. It's up in the air." [...] Slash also commented, saying, [...] "Thanks for all the R mentions, It's quite an honor to be inducted. Cheers!

2500|$|Anselmo {{started his}} own record label called Housecore Records {{sometime}} in 2001. The name derived from Anselmo's home being described {{as more of a}} [...] "hang out" [...] where many local friends and musicians would stay and record music together. Housecore also features in tattoo form on Anselmo's arm (Anselmo's told fans via live webcam that it was his first and favourite tattoo). Anselmo's primary objective is to release much older unreleased material and material from his many side projects. After gaining permission from Pantera's label, Elektra, he merged Housecore with his longtime friend and Necrophagia band mate Killjoy's label, Baphomet Records. The newly named [...] "Baphomet/Housecore Records" [...] secured distribution deals with Relapse Records in August 2001. Anselmo stated [...] "What you're going to get here with Baphomet/Housecore, it's going to be different. It's going to be a fresh approach. It's {{going to be a lot}} of home made shit, not all major label-produced monstrosities. I just got permission from Elektra to independently put out all the bands that I've ever fucking done. Each band that I'm involved in outside of Pantera is a way for me to express and develop different outlets that are very much a part <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> <b>With</b> Pantera it's only one side of me. I love to write and create music, and the side bands are very different from Pantera. They also show the flexibility in me as a musician; Pantera's very important in my life, but there's many other things that keep this boy here content". After only three releases, Anselmo and Killjoy severed business ties, thus returning Anselmo's label to its original name, Housecore Records. Housecore is now actively releasing material by Anselmo and by bands he is producing and supporting.|$|E
