25|$|Dense {{wavelength}} division multiplexing (DWDM) refers originally to optical signals multiplexed {{within the}} 1550nm band so as to leverage the capabilities (and cost) of erbium doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs), which are effective for wavelengths between approximately 1525–1565nm (C band), or 1570–1610nm (L band). EDFAs were originally developed to replace SONET/SDH optical-electrical-optical (OEO) re-generators, which they have made practically obsolete. EDFAs can amplify any optical signal in their operating range, regardless of the modulated bit rate. In terms of multi-wavelength signals, {{so long as the}} EDFA has enough pump energy available to it, it can amplify as many optical signals as can be multiplexed into its amplification band (though signal densities are limited by choice of modulation format). EDFAs therefore allow a single-channel <b>optical</b> <b>link</b> to be upgraded in bit rate by replacing only equipment at the ends of the link, while retaining the existing EDFA or series of EDFAs through a long haul route. Furthermore, single-wavelength links using EDFAs can similarly be upgraded to WDM links at reasonable cost. The EDFA's cost is thus leveraged across as many channels as can be multiplexed into the 1550nm band.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the power}} {{consumption}} of a transparent circuit-switched wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) optical network is evaluated, considering client flow protection requirements {{and the daily}} traffic variability. Moreover, a simple heuristic algorithm {{is applied to the}} considered network scenario to reduce the power consumption of <b>optical</b> <b>links.</b> When traffic load decreases, the algorithm tries to switch off <b>optical</b> <b>links</b> according to several heuristic criteria that take into account the power consumption parameter of links, some topological consideration and the congestion of each fiber. By performing such an optimization, applying the best link-ordering criterion, it is possible to save an amount of power from 28 % up to 86 % of the power consumed by <b>optical</b> <b>links</b> {{on the basis of the}} traffic load. This leads to an average energy saving of 35 % with respect to the energy consumed by the whole optical network. Moreover, we evaluate the impact of network design parameters on the proposed algorithm and the network power consumption. Results show that, for a 18 -node network supporting an average traffic of 75 Gbits/s between each node pair, a number of wavelengths equal to 80 can drastically reduce the power consumption of <b>optical</b> <b>links...</b>|$|R
40|$|As {{microprocessors}} {{become increasingly}} interconnected, {{the power consumed}} by the interconnection network {{can no longer be}} ignored. Moreover, with demand for <b>link</b> bandwidth increasing, <b>optical</b> <b>links</b> are replacing electrical links in inter-chassis and inter-board environments. As a result, the power dissipation of <b>optical</b> <b>links</b> is becoming as critical as their speed. In this paper, we first explore options for building high speed opto-electronic links and discuss the power characteristics of different link components. Then, we propose circuit and network mechanisms that can realize power-aware <b>optical</b> <b>links</b> – links whose power consumption can be tuned dynamically in response to changes in network traffic. Finally, we incorporate power-control policies along with the power characterization of link circuitry into a detailed network simulator to evaluate the performance cost and power savings of building power-aware opto-electronic networked systems. Simulation results show that more than 75 % savings in power consumption can be achieved with the proposed power-aware opto-electronic network. ...|$|R
