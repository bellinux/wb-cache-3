It is the selective attention, perception, and higher order cognitive processing that limits these inputs and it is precisely these processes that make up our conscious awareness. Thus, in order to formulate some explanations for Plato's Problem, our conscious awareness limits our experience; nevertheless, it seems as though some stimuli that are sensed by our sensory registers, although seemingly rejected by conscious awareness, are actually retained and abstracted into <b>our</b> <b>memories</b> for further processing. All of our fully functioning perceptual faculties enhance, supplement, and optimize our experiences.|$|E

500|$|Since its release, Memento {{has been}} a widely noted topic of film discussion, both for its unique {{narrative}} structure and themes. Those searching for explanations of the film's plot have either resorted to online forums, message boards or scholarly material, or have ignored the film's official website and forums {{in order to maintain}} their own personal hypotheses. In an article for The Dissolve analyzing Nolan's work, Mike D'Angelo cites Memento as [...] "a masterful study in deliberate self-delusion," [...] alluding to Leonard's own actions {{towards the end of the}} film and his role as an unreliable narrator. On the same topic of self-deception, James Mooney of filmandphilosophy.com notes that the film suggests how [...] "our memories deceive us, or rather, sometimes we deceive ourselves by ‘choosing’ to forget or by manipulating <b>our</b> <b>memories</b> of past events." [...] This is much in line with a psychological analysis of the film, specifically the act of confabulation. Leonard's use of confabulation poses the dilemma, as explained by SUNY Downstate Medical Center Professor John Kubie for BrainFacts.org: [...] "In Memento we are faced with the question of how much of Leonard's memory of the past is real and how much constructed from beliefs and wishes." ...|$|E

[...] Similarly, the author of the original book, Naoki Hyakuta, disagreed with this line of criticism, stating in a tweet that [...] "In my book Eternal Zero, I opposed suicide attacks with determination", [...] "I have never ever viewed wars in a positive light", and the theme of the book was [...] "not to allow <b>our</b> <b>memories</b> of war to fade away". The author also added in a tweet, [...] "I feel sorry for Eternal Zero. [...] On one side of the political spectrum, Japanese right-wing nationalists claimed the book was plagiarized and were indignant about its criticism of high-ranking Japanese government officials, while on the opposite [...] side, left-wingers criticized it as a glorification of war, Hayao Miyazaki rebukes it for fabrication [...] It is drawing fire literally from all directions." ...|$|E
2500|$|Surface traffic between Central and Admiralty, Causeway Bay, {{as well as}} in Mong Kok, {{was seriously}} {{affected}} by the blockades, with traffic jams stretching for miles on Hong Kong Island and across Victoria Harbour. Major tailbacks were reported on Queensway, Gloucester Road and Connaught Road, which are feeder roads to the blockaded route in Admiralty. With in excess of 100 bus or tram routes suspended or re-routed, queues for underground trains in the Admiralty district spilled onto the street at times. The MTR, the city's underground transport operator, was a beneficiary, enjoying a 20 per cent increase in passenger trips recorded on two of its lines. Others have opted to walk instead of driving. Taxi drivers reported a fall in income as they had to advise passengers to use the MTR when faced with jams, diversions or blockaded roads. Hong Kong Taxi Owners' Association claimed its members' incomes had declined by 30 percent since the protests started. Levels of PM2.5 particulate matter at the three sites declined to within the recommended safety levels of the World Health Organization. An editorial in the South China Morning Post noted that, on 29 September, the air quality in all three of the occupied areas had markedly improved. The health risk posed by airborne pollutants was [...] "low" [...] – it was usually [...] "high" [...] – and there was a steep fall in the concentration of NO2. It said: [...] "without a policy shift, after the demonstrations have ended, we will have to rely on <b>our</b> <b>memories</b> of the protest days for what clean vehicles on our roads mean for air quality".|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe CompCert C {{compiler}} {{guarantees that}} the target program behaves {{as the source}} program. Yet, source programs without a defined semantics do not benefit from this guarantee and could therefore be miscompiled. To reduce {{the possibility of a}} miscompilation, we propose a novel memory model for CompCert which gives a defined semantics to challenging features such as bitwise pointer arithmetics and access to uninitialised data. We evaluate <b>our</b> <b>memory</b> model both theoretically and experimentally. In our experiments, we identify pervasive low-level C idioms that require the additional expressiveness provided by <b>our</b> <b>memory</b> model. We also show that <b>our</b> <b>memory</b> model provably subsumes the existing CompCert memory model thus cross-validating both semantics. <b>Our</b> <b>memory</b> model relies on the core concepts of symbolic value and normalisa-tion. A symbolic value models a delayed computation and the normalisation turns, when possible, a symbolic value into a genuine value. We show how to tame the expressive power of the normalisation so that the memory model fits the proof framework of CompCert. We also adapt the proofs of correctness of the compiler passes performed by CompCert's front-end, thus demonstrating that our model is well-suited for proving compiler transformations...|$|R

40|$|Learning is an {{important}} part of the immune system by which the immune system maintains a memory of the infections it has encountered to protect against future attacks. In this paper we incorporate the mechanism of maintaining a memory in the recently proposed GC-AIS algorithm. GC-AIS has shown good performance on the static set cover problem (SCP) in recent work [13] and we are interested in investigating the merits of GC-AIS in a dynamic setting. We compare the affect of GC-AIS with and without a memory approach on the dynamic SCP instances, which are created with varying degrees of modifications to instances from [2]. Three types of modifications are proposed in the paper by adding, removing or editing the subsets from the original problem instances. It is shown that for the case of adding subsets to the original instance using <b>our</b> <b>memory</b> approach is always beneficial while for the case of removing subsets using <b>our</b> <b>memory</b> approach almost always results in worse performance than when not utilising memory. Finally in the cases with editing subsets it is shown that for lower levels of modification using <b>our</b> <b>memory</b> approach gives better results while when the level of modification is higher <b>our</b> <b>memory</b> based approach is worse than using no memory. authorsversio...|$|R

40|$|<b>Our</b> <b>memory</b> of past choices {{influences}} {{our future}} choices, yet {{is subject to}} error and manipulation. Choice blindness {{studies have shown that}} people often fail to notice when an option they did not choose is presented in place of one they chose. This raises the question of just how we remember the choices we make. Do we remember all options similarly, or does the process of choosing bias <b>our</b> <b>memory</b> in ways that make us susceptible to the deception in choice blindness tasks? I begin by contrasting choice blindness with change blindness to develop an account of cognitive processes in choice blindness, followed by an overview of contemporary research on choice and memory. Experiment 1 then tests the effect choosing a face has on <b>our</b> <b>memory</b> of that face, compared with <b>our</b> <b>memory</b> of the alternative, unchosen face. Results show that chosen faces are better recognised than unchosen, regardless of whether the chosen faces are actually preferred. Experiment 2 tests <b>our</b> <b>memory</b> for decisions made, and shows participants remember that they chose a face better than they remember that they did not choose a face. A third experiment tests these effects in a replication and variation of the original choice blindness task. In the variant, after deception participants are deceptively asked to justify why they did not choose a face which they actually just chose. Results suggest that the counter-intuitive choice blindness phenomenon is not being driven by a failure of the deceptively presented face to cue sufficient memories to detect the deception. Qualitative findings suggest that increasing the importance of the choice may facilitate experimental research with choice blindness tasks. An integration across my studies highlights some problems for contemporary self-reference and self-choice based theories of choice and memory...|$|R
