40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} has been to provide a better {{understanding}} of pricing within industrial markets. Previous researchers have established that when deciding pricing strategy and ultimately the final price for a product, the marketing managers must take many factors, both internal and external, into consideration. This thesis will mainly investigate the internal factors that affect a manufacturer within industrial markets. To be able to get {{a better understanding of}} pricing within industrial markets, a case study was performed at <b>Ovako</b> <b>Steel</b> <b>AB,</b> a manufacturer of special engineering steel. The company operates within many markets both domestically and internationally. In many of the domestic markets, the company are market leader, both with regard to market share and price level and was therefore suitable for this study. In contradiction to previous research a finding from this study was that the investigated company actually were able to maintain a high price strategy over a longer period of time. The use of the analysis of the company’ customers and products as a tool for developing price differentiations were found to be very useful. Although the result of the analysis was not what the marketing staff had hoped for, it is a good starting point to develop a system for price differentiation. Additional finding for this study was that companies that is faced with high manufacturing costs and therefore use a high price strategy and act as price leaders in one or several markets, have to consider the use of augmented products to be able to create and maintain a high price.

40|$|During this project, several {{different}} steel grades {{that were made}} by <b>Ovako</b> <b>steel</b> company were chosen, then they were treated differently (Annealed, through hardened, carburized, nitridized, induction hardened, and DLC coated), finally by the means of an in house Vibrophore machine, and a costume made cyclic impactor a test setup were introduced. Samples were tested in two different force conditions of 1900 N and 2400 N, and in four different impact cycles as per 1000, 10000, 100000, 500000, then surfaces of these specimens were analyzed both macroscopically and microscopically and achieved results were documented. Finally a comparison among {{the size of the}} biggest appeared surface ring cracks, number of appeared surface ring cracks that were above 40 µm, indentation radius and penetration depth of the impacted surface areas after applying cyclic impact force were made, and results were shown. As the final result of the introduced impact fatigue test it is concluded that samples designated as I and H (<b>Ovako</b> <b>steel</b> grade 804 Q_DLC coated, 528 Q_DLC respectively) had the same and best impact fatigue resistance among the tested samples, following by DLC coated samples designated as G (803 J), these samples were followed from the best to worst as per samples E (528 Q_induction hardened), samples B (256 G_carburized), samples J (804 Q_through hardened), samples D (277 Q_nitrided), samples C (225 A_nitrided), and worst achieved results were from samples designated as A (804 Q_annealed).
