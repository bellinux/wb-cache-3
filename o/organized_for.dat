40|$|PURPOSE – The {{purpose of}} the paper is to study the role of art based {{practices}} in driving and shaping the <b>organizing</b> <b>for</b> creativity (organizational creativity). The paper examines how the art based practices driven from improvisational theater could help in conceptualizing and shaping an <b>organizing</b> <b>for</b> creativity (organizational creativity). APPROACH – The paper draws from literature studies to conceptualize organizational creativity as an <b>organizing</b> <b>for</b> creativity. The study forms a framework to understand <b>organizing</b> <b>for</b> creativity and explore how the art based practices of improvisational theater (collective improvisation) could enhance it. ORIGINALITY – This methodology puts in evidence conceptualization of organizational creativity from a novel point of view i. e. {{from the point of}} view of organizing. In contrast to ownership and outcome oriented views of creativity, the study aims to understand organizational creativity more as an interaction and interrelated activities of various actors within a system. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS – The outcomes of the application provide a framework for management to understand organizational creativity as creative organizing and to utilize the art based practices, specifically from improvisational theater, to foster it. Hence, <b>organizing</b> <b>for</b> creativity means the utilization of various novel and temporary forms of <b>organizing</b> (<b>for</b> example, such as inter-organizational crowdsourcing) for the achievement of organizational goals...|$|R

5|$|A large {{tropical}} wave, {{which eventually}} became Erika, moved {{off the coast}} of Africa on August 31. Shortly after leaving the coast, it displayed a large low-level circulation, though as it tracked westward, the circulation failed to contract significantly. It slowly organized, and by September 3 the convection within the circulation had sufficiently <b>organized</b> <b>for</b> the system to be classified as Tropical Depression Six, while located about 1150miles (1850km) east of the southernmost Lesser Antilles. The depression moved west-northwestward at approximately 20mph (32km/h) under the influence of a well-established subtropical ridge, and late on September 3 the system intensified into a tropical storm. At that time, the National Hurricane Center in Miami gave the storm the name of Erika.|$|E

5|$|Believing {{that the}} 4th Division {{was still at}} Camp Greene, Middleton wired there {{to find out that}} the unit was already on its way overseas. He caught a train for New York, and when he arrived on 28 April 1918, he found his {{division}} at Camp Mills on Long Island, living in tents and awaiting transport. Middleton was given command of the First Battalion, 47th Infantry Regiment, and departed New York with his regiment aboard the Princess Matokia on 11 May in a convoy of fourteen ships. Three days out of France, a fleet of destroyers met the convoy and escorted it to the port city of Brest where they arrived on 23 May. There the division unloaded and <b>organized</b> <b>for</b> several days, subsequently loading onto a troop train to arrive at Calais on 30 May.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Andres {{originated}} out of {{a tropical}} wave that entered the eastern Pacific basin on June16 after crossing Central America. Over the following few days, showers and thunderstorms began to organize around the wave. At this time, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) remarked upon the possibility for tropical cyclone formation. By June20, the wave spawned an {{area of low pressure}} roughly 175mi (280km) south-southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. Around 1200UTC the following day, the system had become sufficiently <b>organized</b> <b>for</b> the NHC to designate the low as Tropical Depression Two-E. The depression briefly track westward before turning towards the northwest, a track which it would maintain for the remained of its existence, due to a mid-tropospheric ridge located northeast of the system.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Ida {{originated}} from a weak tropical wave that reached the western Caribbean on November1, 2009. By November2, the system spawned {{an area of}} low pressure north of Panama which moved very little over the following days. The low became increasingly organized within a favorable environment that allowed deep convection to develop. By November4, the low had become sufficiently <b>organized</b> <b>for</b> the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to classify it as Tropical Depression Eleven. At this time, the tropical depression was situated just southwest of San Andrés Island. Convective banding features became increasingly defined throughout the day, and six hours after becoming a tropical depression, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Ida.|$|E

50|$|<b>Organizing</b> <b>for</b> America, then <b>Organizing</b> <b>for</b> Action, (OFA) is a {{community}} organizing project of the Democratic National Committee. Initially founded after the presidential inauguration of Barack Obama, the group sought to mobilize supporters in favor of Obama's legislative priorities, particularly health care reform. Eventually, the organization {{played a role in}} the midterm elections of 2010. Later, it became the grassroots arm of Obama for America. After Obama's second inauguration, it was reorganized as <b>Organizing</b> <b>for</b> Action and returned to its previous mission of organizing around the President's agenda. It has since turned into a hub of the Democratic protest movement.|$|R

5|$|In early July, {{widespread}} {{showers and}} thunderstorms developed across the Western Pacific underneath a tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT). On July9, a single cumulonimbus cloud west of Wake Island became {{associated with the}} TUTT and quickly organized. By July11, the system featured a small central dense overcast and soon became sufficiently <b>organized</b> <b>for</b> the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to declare it as Tropical Depression 11W. Upon classification, the system was located roughly 320km (200mi) east of the Northern Mariana Islands. The development of the depression was unprecedented in two ways: first, a single cloud developed into a tropical cyclone; and second, it became tropical while situated underneath a cold-core low.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, U.S. ground forces were {{introduced}} into combat roles in large numbers, {{and the first}} US Marines came ashore at Da Nang in Thi's I Corps. The flamboyant Thi <b>organized</b> <b>for</b> the American troops to be greeted by military bands, welcoming banners and teenage girls who garlanded them with flowers. This caused embarrassment to US military officials who felt the introduction of combat troops and resultant American casualties would not be received well by the public when contrasted with Thi's celebratory fanfare. Soon after the Americans were in position, Thi tipped off Marine Lieutenant General Lewis W. Walt about a major movement of Việt Cộng insurgents near Chu Lai in Quảng Trị Province near the border with North Vietnam. This resulted in Operation Starlite, generally regarded as the first offensive action undertaken by the Americans in the Vietnam War. Occurring between 18–24 August, it resulted in the 1st Việt Cộng Regiment being pushed to the coast.|$|E

5|$|Nora Belahcen Fitzgerald first {{conceived}} {{of the idea}} of creating an organization to help Morocco's underprivileged women through career training in 2006 after meeting a single mother begging on the street who lived on 2030 dirhams per day (about €2.70, $3.40 in 2006). Belahcen Fitzgerald was inspired by the Association Solidarité Féminine, which helps single mothers overcome poverty and social stigma by providing them with shelter, counselling, and vocational training. She decided to begin helping women by teaching them to make baked goods in her family's language center. This proved to be successful, and the participants were able to make more money using their new skills than by begging. In 2008, Belahcen Fitzgerald began hiring underprivileged Moroccan women to cook for events she <b>organized</b> <b>for</b> her friends.|$|E
5|$|Sinatra {{continued}} {{to perform at}} Caesars Palace in the late 1970s, and was performing there in January 1977 when his mother Dolly {{died in a plane}} crash on the way to see him. He cancelled two weeks of shows and spent time recovering from the shock in Barbados. In March, he performed in front of Princess Margaret at the Royal Albert Hall in London, raising money for the NSPCC. On March 14, he recorded with Nelson Riddle for the last time, recording the songs Linda, Sweet Loraine, and Barbara. The two men had a major falling out, and later patched up their differences in January 1985 at a dinner <b>organized</b> <b>for</b> Ronald Reagan, when Sinatra asked Riddle to make another album with him. Riddle was ill at the time, and died that October, before they had a chance to record.|$|E
5|$|Still {{interested}} in military affairs, Buckner joined the Illinois State Militia of Cook County as a major.

Following the Mountain Meadows massacre, a regiment of Illinois volunteers <b>organized</b> <b>for</b> potential service in a campaign against the Mormons. Buckner was offered command of the unit and a promotion {{to the rank of}} colonel. He accepted the position, but predicted that the unit would not see action. His prediction proved correct, as negotiations between the federal government and Mormon leaders eased tensions between the two.|$|E

5|$|The Global Climate Coalition (GCC) {{was formed}} in 1989 as a project {{under the auspices of}} the National Association of Manufacturers. The GCC was formed to {{represent}} the interests of the major producers and users of fossil fuels, to oppose regulation to mitigate global warming, and to challenge the science behind global warming. Context for the founding of the GCC from 1988 included the establishment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and NASA climatologist James Hansen's congressional testimony that climate change was occurring. The government affairs' offices of five or six corporations recognized that they had been inadequately <b>organized</b> <b>for</b> the Montreal Protocol, the international treaty that phased out ozone depleting chlorofluorocarbons, and the Clean Air Act in the United States, and recognized that fossil fuels would be targeted for regulation.|$|E
5|$|The Waldorf–Astoria gained {{significant}} renown for its fundraising {{dinners and}} balls, regularly attracting notables {{of the day}} such as Andrew Carnegie who became a fixture. Banquets were often held in the ballroom for esteemed figures and international royalty. On February 11, 1899, Oscar of the Waldorf hosted a lavish dinner reception which the New York Herald Tribune cited as the city's costliest dinner at the time. Some $250 was spent per guest, with bluepoint oysters, green turtle soup, lobster, ruddy duck and blue raspberries. Two months later, 120 sailors of the cruiser Raleigh were given a banquet, during which the gallery was decorated with silk banners and flags. One article that year claimed that {{at any one time}} the hotel had $7 million worth of valuables locked in the safe, testament to the wealth of its guests.

5|$|The {{city was}} well <b>organized</b> <b>for</b> defense, {{and in the}} Battle for Brest Middleton's units went about {{capturing}} it methodically. The defense {{of the city was}} under German Generalleutnant Hermann Ramcke with whom Middleton carried on a dialog during the siege. Ramcke sent Middleton a map showing where several hundred American prisoners were being held in the city, but also slyly placed on the map a number of red crosses where the Allies knew some good bombing targets were located, such as ammunition depots. Middleton wrote back to Ramcke telling him to remove some of the bogus red crosses, or some terms of the Geneva Convention might have to be ignored. Middleton also reminded Ramcke of the Allies' superior artillery and air power.|$|E
