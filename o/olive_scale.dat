40|$|<b>Olive</b> <b>scale</b> (Parlatoria oleae (Colvée)) is {{a common}} pest in Mediterranean olive {{orchards}} which primarily causes damage on olive fruits. The quality of virgin olive oil is strongly related to the health status of the olive fruits from which is extracted. In this paper the effects of <b>olive</b> <b>scale</b> (Parlatoria oleae (Colvée)) attack on the oil yield, chemical and sensorial quality, {{as well as on}} the fatty acid profile of virgin olive oil were studied. Olive fruits (Olea europea L.) from Bova cultivar (Istria, Croatia) were collected and divided into different groups according to the presence or absence of infestation by the <b>olive</b> <b>scale.</b> <b>Olive</b> <b>scale</b> attack did not induce ripening process nor stimulate oil synthesis in the infested fruits. Healthy and infested fruit groups were processed separately to produce corresponding olive oils. As regards the oil acidity, the oil samples obtained from infested fruits had similar values as samples obtained from healthy fruits. However, <b>olive</b> <b>scale</b> attack led to slight oxidative deterioration of oil, but had no effect on sensory characteristics of obtained olive oils. Fatty acid profile was slightly affected by <b>olive</b> <b>scale</b> attack: an increase of linoleic (about 13 %) and palmitoleic acid (about 8 %), but a decrease of oleic (about 3 %) and stearic acid (about 4 %) in oils obtained from infested fruits was detected. Oleic to linoleic ratio was lower in oils obtained from infested fruits indicating its lower oxidative stability...|$|E
30|$|Olive {{is one of}} the {{important}} economical crops in Egypt. Olive trees are attacked by insect pests that affect quality and quantity of the yield. On olive trees, populations of the fruit fly, Bacteracera (Dacus) oleae Gamel are suppressed by the braconid parasitoid, Opius concolor Szepl. (Ajjan 1962), and those of the <b>olive</b> <b>scale</b> insect Parasaissetia oleae by the pteromalid parasitoid Sautellistea cyanea Mols. (Hosny et al. 1966). The two stem borers, Phlocotribus scarabaeides Bern. and Zeuzera pyrina L. are parasitized by two pteromalids, Cheiropochus quadrum and Rhaphitelus maculatus, and two unidentified species belonging to the genera Euplemus and Eurytoma (Ismail et al. 1988). The shot-hole borer Scolytus amaygdali (Coleoptera: Scolytidae) of olive trees is parasitized during its larval stage by seven hymenopterous parasitoids, i.e., Cerocephala cornigera, Cheiropachus quadrum, Rhaphites maculatus (Pteromalidae), Cephalonoma sp. (Bethylidae), Eupelmus sp. (Eupelmidae), Eurytoma sp. (Eurytomidae), and Leptomastix trunctellus (Encyrtidae) (Ismail et al. 1988). In most recent studies, El-Khawas et al. (2000) presented a detail record concerning parasitoids on common olive pests in Egypt, in Alexandria, Fayoum, and North Sinai Governorates. Opius concolor Szeph. (Braconidae), Prigalio agraules Walker (Eulophidae), Eupelmus sp. and Macroneara sp. (Eurytomidae), Eurytoma martelli Masi and Eurytoma sp. (Eurytomidae), and Cryptoprymna latipes Ronaldi (Pteromalidae) were reported on larvae of Bacterocera (Dacus) oleae, and Prays oleae Bern that feed on leaves, flower buds, and fruits was subject to attack by Apanteles sp. and Bracon sp. (Braconidae), while the Jasmine moth, Palipta unionalis Hb., that feeds on buds was parasitized by Apanteles syleptae F. (Braconidae) and Brachymeria aegyptiaca Masi (Chalcididae). The armored scale insect Leucaspis riccae Targ was attacked by Aphytis sp., while the California red scale A. aurantii by Marietta sp. (Aphelinidae) and Habrolepis sp. (Encyrtidae). A recent survey on parasitoids of B. oleae carried out by El-Heneidy et al. (2001 b) in Alexandria and El-Fayoum Governorates included eight hymenopterous parasitoids namely Cyroptyx latipes R., Cyroptyx sp., Eupelmus sp., Eurytoma sp., Eurytoma martelli, Macroneura sp., Prigalio agraules W., and Opius concolor S. The first seven species were recorded {{for the first time in}} Egypt. The eighth parasitoid species was recorded in the fresh fruits, while only six were recorded from the fallen fruits. All species were recorded during the period from July to November. Mean percentages of parasitism reached 38.9 and 10.8 % by the two species; O. concolor and P. agraules, respectively.|$|E

40|$|All olives’ {{treatment}} processes (olives, olive oil, olive wooden residue) produce {{liquid and}} solid wastes, which are considered toxic. The treatment of these wastes by using conventional technologies (aerobic/anaerobic biological treatment, incineration, gasification ect) {{proved to be}} neither technically nor cost effective. This fact treats the olive oil production by complete cease due to the serious environmental problems caused. The proposed technology includes the detoxification of wastewater by Fenton oxidation reactions and following their utilization by biological treatment methods. The latter is achieved by the implementation of anaerobic digestion process on the oxidized wastewater and the consequent methane production and by co-composting the oxidized or/and anaerobic digested wastewater with solid wastes (olive mill wooden residue, leaves, branches ect.), leading {{to the production of}} a high quality soil conditioner. The biogas produced could be utilized for in situ thermal and electrical energy production. The two biological processes used (anaerobic digestion and composting) are ideal combined, since the anaerobic digested wastewaters are totally used in composting process, while the excess thermal energy produced by biogas utilization can accelerate the aerobic biological processes resulting in a high quality biological fertilizer. The proposed technology is effective and simple to be implemented. Wastewaters derive either from two or three phase olive mill could be treated. This technology can be implemented either in one <b>olive</b> mill <b>scale</b> or in central wastewater treatment plants. The proposed technology can not only effectively face the serious environmental problems caused by olive mill wastewater disposal, but it poses new perspectives in olive trees cultivation and olive oil and its by-products market...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{fertility}} variation at <b>olive</b> orchard <b>scale</b> was {{studied in}} a rainfed olive orchard {{located on a}} topographical sequence in the centre of Tunisia (34. 37 N 10. 16 E). Soil parameters such as pH, organic matter, gypsum, lime, N, P and K contents and soil electrical conductivity were determined in samples obtained at 1 m depth and used to characterize soil fertility. Leaf samples from olive trees (cv Chemlali) 80 yrs old and at squared spacing distance (24 x 24 m apart) were collected in mid-July 2005 to verify plant nutritional status. A regular 200 m x 200 m sampling grid was established and the intersection points were georeferenced. Each soil fertility component was analyzed statistically and geostatistically. Interpolations were realized according to thresholds and standard deviation of every parameter. Estimates were used to draw variation maps of each soil fertility component (Kriging method). High geodistribution variation was detected. The results showed that an important area is menaced by K deficiency. Indeed, in this area soil K 2 O content revealed {{to be under the}} threshold of 80 ppm. Another area, located in the higher part of the topographical sequence resulted to be affected by a high concentration of sulfates, carbonates and sodium. The study of the relationship between soil and plant concentrations for several nutrients did not allow to single out any correlation. Nevertheless, the carbohydrates allocation in the tree was influenced by soil fertility status. The hypothesis that to overlap stress caused by soil limiting conditions the tree concentrate assimilates in the active parts to increase osmotic pressure is discussed. Under these conditions, olive tree may develop a protection system leading to low reserve carbohydrates and yield...|$|R

The fruits fermented with the potential probiotic strains were packaged under different packaging systems (vaccum and brine) and storage conditions (4 ºC and 22 ºC) and microbiological, physicochemical and organoleptic parameters were studied. After 90 days of storage the results showed that the lactic acid bacteria were present in satisfactory amounts required by FAO/WHO for probiotic food (106 cfu/g) at 22 ºC at both vaccum and brine pouches.

40|$|After oil {{extraction}} from olives, {{large amounts of}} by-products are generated every year. If subjected to advanced biotechnologies of composting they can be re-used in agriculture as eco-compatible amenders, fertilizers and/or natural pesticide. In this regard, olive oil by-products composted in a pilot <b>scale</b> <b>olive</b> plant were characterized and assayed for suppressive activity against fungal plant pathogens. Some cured composts consistently reduced the growth in vitro of Verticillium dahliae and other important fungal pathogens. The efficacy of composts decreased or disappeared when the composts were autoclaved before using. The inhibitory activity seems due to the beneficial residual microbial population selected during the composting process. In experiments performed on young olive plants grown on soil artificially contaminated by V. dahliae microsclerotia (MC), the incorporation of 15 % (w/w) of a selected cured compost or the antagonistic fungus Trichoderma viridae as well as 15 % (w/w) of cured compost and T. viridae applied together significantly reduced the density of V. dahliae MC in the soil. The results of this investigation indicate that composted olive by-products are very promising to control fungal pathogens of olive and other crops in organic and integrated agriculture systems. Monitoring of V. dahliae MC in the soil by a semi-selective media was compared to a molecular method based on Real-Time Scorpion PCR. The latter technique, which enables V. dahliae detection by a specific increase of fluorescence during amplification, drastically reduced the time required {{for the assessment of}} V. dahliae MC in the soil, as compared to the microbiological cultural techniques...|$|R

40|$|The Mediterranean Basin is {{increasingly}} challenged by invasive species, with the bacterial pathogen Xylella fastidiosa recently detected in olive in southern Italy being simply another one. Xylella {{is a major}} threat for organic and sustainable olive culture in the Mediterranean Basin where olive plays a vital ecological and socioeconomic role. Xylella {{is limited to the}} xylem system of plants from where it is transmitted by xylem-sap feeding insects. The olive/Xylella system is extremely complex and difficult to assess and manage because virtually all insects that feed on xylem sap are potential vectors of Xylella, and because the bacteria can be hosted by a very broad range of plants that can carry the bacteria without showing symptoms of disease. An additional layer of complexity is climate change that will affect differently each component of the olive/Xylella system. Such complexity requires development of a holistic analysis based on the ecological requirements for growth, survival and reproduction of olive, Xylella, its vectors and their natural enemies so as to determine the potential geographic distribution, abundance, and impact of this disease. The present paper illustrates how a holistic analysis could be developed for the olive/Xylella system using physiologically based demographic models (PBDMs) to assess and manage the disease on a regional basis. PBDMs build on the idea that all organisms in all trophic levels are consumers with resource acquisition processes having similar shapes described by the same mathematical functions, and with analogous allocation priorities. These analogies enable PBDMs to capture relevant ecosystem complexity at all trophic levels using a modest number of measurable parameters. In a previous analysis, PBDMs were developed for the glassy-winged sharpshooter (GWSS; Homalodisca vitripennis) that vectors X. fastidiosa causing Pierce's disease in grape in California, and for two egg parasitoids introduced for GWSS control. The model predicted that the potential range of X. fastidiosa is considerably less than that of GWSS, and that with biological control of GWSS the potential range of the pathogen was reduced still further to the desert regions of southern California. PBDM analysis was able to separate and quantify the biotic and abiotic factors that affect the distribution and abundance of X. fastidiosa in grape at the geographic scale of California, and is expected to achieve comparable results for X. fastidiosa in <b>olive</b> at the <b>scale</b> of the Mediterranean Basin...|$|R
40|$|In PhD thesis, it was {{proved that}} the {{toxicity}} of olive mill wastewater during the aerobic biological degradation {{could be attributed to}} the presence of phenolic compounds (TPC) in the wastewater. It was also {{proved that the}} Fenton oxidation process (Fe 2 + + H 2 O 2) was capable of breaking down TPC in chemical compounds that were more biodegradable. The oxidation of TPC followed pseudo-first order kinetics and it was influenced by the initial concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and ferrous sulphate (FeSO 4. 7 H 2 O) and by the reaction temperature under constant pH. The TPC oxidation reaction was very rapid and was completed in 30 minutes. The influence of the initial concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and ferrous sulphate (FeSO 4. 7 H 2 O) and of the reaction temperature and pH on the infinite concentrations of TPC and TOC and on the maximum organic carbon degradation rate (kmax) was studied in laboratory scale by a 24 factorial experiment. It was proved that TPC reduction was strongly influenced by the hydrogen peroxide concentration and pH while TOC reduction was influenced not only by the parameters mentioned above but by the ferrous sulphate initial concentration as well. The maximum organic carbon degradation rate (kmax) was just influenced by H 2 O 2 and pH. According to the standard optimization processes of a factorial experiment, it was concluded that under the optimum oxidation conditions, the maximum TPC reduction was 92 % (H 2 O 2 : 3, 037 g/l, Fe 2 +: 0, 44 g/l, pH: 0, 86, T: 21, 3 οC), the maximum TOC reduction TOC 54 % (H 2 O 2 : 1. 58 g/l, Fe 2 +: 0, 947 g/l, pH: 3, 22, T: 26, 4 οC), while the maximum organic carbon degradation rate after Fenton oxidation was 9 d- 1 (H 2 O 2 : 3, 2 g/l, Fe 2 +: 0, 06 g/l, pH: 6, 75, T: 15, 7 οC). A semi-industrial <b>scale</b> <b>olive</b> mill wastewater treatment plant was constructed. It included a Fenton oxidation unit followed by a co-composting plant that treated oxidized wastewater with olive stone wooden residues (OSWR). The influence of the initial Fenton’s reagent concentrations (H 2 O 2 and FeSO 4. 7 H 2 O) and of the pH on the oxidized wastewater consumption and {{on the quality of the}} final product in terms of Germination Index (GI) and humic compound content was studied. From the 36 experiments conducted in semi-industrial scale, it was deduced that the optimum oxidation conditions in ambient temperature were: [Η 2 Ο 2, 60 %] = 1 kg/m 3 wastewater, [FeSO 4. 7 H 2 O] = 4 kg/m 3 wastewater, pH = 3, 5. Under these conditions, the wastewater consumption was 3084 kg wastewater/tn OSWR (in contrast to initial consumption 1084 kg/tn), the maximum organic carbon degradation rate was 0, 0487 d- 1, the germination index was equal to 210 % (in contrast to 37 %) and the humic compound content was 40, 43 % (in contrast to 13, 34 %). Last, a techno-economical study was conducted based on the results mentioned above and on comparison data of utilization of the mature compost. This study took into account variables such as the capacity of the olive mill. This way, the sustainability of the proposed technology was confirmed. ...|$|R

The understanding with Verena was, of course, complete; she had promised to stay with her friend as long as her friend should require it. She had said at first that she couldn't give up her mother, but she had been made to feel that there was no question of giving up. She should be as free as air, to go and come; she could spend hours and days with her mother, whenever Mrs. Tarrant required her attention; all that Olive asked of her was that, for the time, she should regard Charles Street as her home. There was no struggle about this, {{for the simple reason that}} by the time the question came to the front Verena was completely under the charm. The idea of Olive's charm will perhaps make the reader smile; but I use the word not in its derived, but in its literal sense. The fine web of authority, of dependence, that her strenuous companion had woven about her, was now as dense as a suit of golden mail; and Verena was thoroughly interested in their great undertaking; she saw it in the light of an active, enthusiastic faith. The benefit that her father desired for her was now assured; she expanded, developed, on the most liberal <b>scale.</b> <b>Olive</b> saw the difference, and you may imagine how she rejoiced in it; she had never known a greater pleasure. Verena's former attitude had been girlish submission, grateful, curious sympathy. She had given herself, in her young, amused surprise, because Olive's stronger will and the incisive proceedings with which she pointed her purpose drew her on. Besides, she was held by hospitality, the vision of new social horizons, the sense of novelty, and the love of change. But now the girl was disinterestedly attached to the precious things they were to do together; she cared about them for themselves, believed in them ardently, had them constantly in mind. Her share in the union of the two young women was no longer passive, purely appreciative; it was passionate, too, and it put forth a beautiful energy. If Olive desired to get Verena into training, she could flatter herself that the process had already begun, and that her colleague enjoyed it almost as much as she. Therefore she could say to herself, without the imputation of heartlessness, that when she left her mother it was for a noble, a sacred use. In point of fact, she left her very little, and she spent hours in jingling, aching, jostled journeys between Charles Street and the stale suburban cottage. Mrs. Tarrant sighed and grimaced, wrapped herself more than ever in her mantle, said she didn't know as she was fit to struggle alone, and that, half the time, if Verena was away, she wouldn't have the nerve to answer the door-bell; she was incapable, of course, of neglecting such an opportunity to posture as one who paid with her heart's blood for leading the van of human progress. But Verena had an inner sense (she judged her mother now, a little, for the first time) that she would be sorry to be taken at her word, and that she felt safe enough in trusting to her daughter's generosity. She could not divest herself of the faith--even now that Mrs. Luna was gone, leaving no trace, and the grey walls of a sedentary winter were apparently closing about the two young women--she could not renounce the theory that a residence in Charles Street must at least produce some contact with the brilliant classes. She was vexed at her daughter's resignation to not going to parties and to Miss Chancellor's not giving them; but it was nothing new for her to have to practise patience, and she could feel, at least, that it was just as handy for Mr. Burrage to call on the child in town, where he spent half his time, sleeping constantly at Parker's.|$|R
