5|$|Since {{the very}} early days of alpine {{mountaineering}} a number of high-altitude mountain refuges have been positioned strategically across the massif to give climbers easier access to the high summits by permitting an <b>overnight</b> <b>stay.</b> The majority are owned by national mountaineering clubs, and many are wardened during the summer months, although the smaller bivouac huts are unmanned and have very basic facilities.|$|E
5|$|Private flying can be {{for both}} {{recreational}} purposes and personal transport, using aircraft that are owned individually, collectively {{as part of a}} syndicate, or rented from a flying club. A survey of pilots conducted between 2001 and 2002 indicated that the most common purposes of recreational flights were local flights near the base aerodrome, visits to other aerodromes, and day trips away. Half of all flights landed at the same aerodrome they departed from, and only 9 per cent involved an <b>overnight</b> <b>stay</b> away from home.|$|E
5|$|Although Panther Central, the Towers Lobby which connects {{all three}} towers, and the dining {{services}} {{located on the}} ground floor are accessible to everyone, only residents are allowed in the individual towers and must present their student ID card to a 24-hour security guard to gain entrance. Visitors to any of the Towers must be signed in by a resident of the Tower, and must present either their student ID card if they are a student or a valid form of photographic identification if they are not. Guests signed in by residents must be signed out and leave the Tower by 2:00 AM. If not, an <b>overnight</b> <b>stay</b> request must be completed, of which a student can only file a certain number each academic semester. No resident is permitted to sign in more than three people at one time.|$|E

The bathing resorts on the Baltic Sea had somewhat more visitors (720,115) than those on the North Sea (604,548), but on average the North Sea guests stayed longer, so that the total of <b>overnight</b> <b>stays</b> was greater (5,122,549) than on the Baltic Sea.

5|$|In 1832, the Metropolitan Police Service {{built a new}} station {{house on}} the site of No.33–34. This did not include the Bow Street Runners, who {{retained}} their own identity until the organisation disbanded in 1839. A new magistrates' court was designed by John Taylor at a cost of £38,400 (now £) and constructed between 1879–81. Oscar Wilde {{was arrested and charged with}} gross indecency at the court in 1895; following an <b>overnight</b> <b>stay</b> on remand, he ordered tea, toast and eggs from the nearby Tavistock Hotel, who delivered them to his cell. In 1961, Bertrand Russell, then aged 89, was brought to the court after demonstrating as part of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. He later spent a week at Brixton Prison. The courts closed in July 2006 as its Grade II listing meant it was not economical to update it to modern standards. The building is planned to be converted into a boutique hotel.|$|E
5|$|The use of fast horse-drawn coaches, {{known as}} 'Flying Coaches', began in 1669. Travelling between London and Oxford by coach had {{involved}} an <b>overnight</b> <b>stay</b> at Beaconsfield, but Oxford University organised {{a project to}} allow completion of the journey between sunrise and sunset. The project succeeded, and was quickly copied by Cambridge University; {{by the end of}} Charles II's reign, in 1685, Flying Coaches ran three times a week from London to all major towns, in good conditions covering a distance of around fifty miles in a day. The Thoroughbred horse was developed from about this time, with native mares being crossbred to Arab, Turk and Barb horses to produce excellent racehorses; the General Stud Book, giving clear and detailed pedigrees, was first published in the 1790s, and the lineage of today's Thoroughbred horses can be traced with great accuracy to 1791. Horses running in races sponsored by the monarchy then carried weights of around , more than the usual weight of 8–10stone (51–64kg), indicating that horse racing, hunting and chasing partly originated in a need for military training.|$|E

25|$|Desperate to find {{a source}} of income from his vast land acquisitions, Lüderitz planned another {{expedition}} to the Orange River in 1886. This time he took part himself, and set off in July with three others.

The boat in which Lüderitz travelled was never found; their last reported <b>overnight</b> <b>stay</b> was on 21/22 October.|$|E

25|$|Saint-Exupéry {{may have}} drawn {{inspiration}} for the prince's character and appearance from his own self as a youth, as during his early years friends and family called him le Roi-Soleil (the Sun King) because of his golden curly hair. The author had also met a precocious eight-year-old with curly blond hair while he was residing with a family in Quebec City in 1942, Thomas De Koninck, the son of philosopher Charles De Koninck. Another possible {{inspiration for the}} little prince has been suggested as Land Morrow Lindbergh, the young, golden-haired son of fellow aviator Charles Lindbergh Jr. and his wife, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, whom he met during an <b>overnight</b> <b>stay</b> at their Long Island home in 1939.|$|E
25|$|A daily {{through train}} between Hamar and Trondheim was {{introduced}} {{with the opening}} of the line in 1877. It connected with a morning train and steamship departure from Oslo, and required an <b>overnight</b> <b>stay</b> in Koppang. The train stopped the following day at Røros for dinner, with arrival in Trondheim that evening. Parliament approved the first stage of the Dovre Line in 1875, opening between Eidsvoll and Hamar on 8 November 1880. This allowed a significant cut in travel time and from 1881 direct services were introduced, with travel times from Oslo to Trondheim at 24 hours and 15 minutes. At first this ran only during the summer, but from 1885 it ran all year. The cheaper trains with an overnight in Koppang continued to be run.|$|E

25|$|For over a century, New Haven {{citizens}} {{had fought}} in the colonial militia alongside regular British forces, as in the French and Indian War. As the American Revolution approached, General David Wooster and other influential residents hoped that the conflict with the government in Britain could be resolved short of rebellion. On 23 April 1775, which is still celebrated in New Haven as Powder House Day, the Second Company, Governor's Foot Guard, of New Haven entered the struggle against the governing British parliament. Under Captain Benedict Arnold, they broke into the powder house to arm themselves and began a three-day march to Cambridge, Massachusetts. Other New Haven militia members were on hand to escort George Washington from his <b>overnight</b> <b>stay</b> in New Haven {{on his way to}} Cambridge. Contemporary reports, from both sides, remark on the New Haven volunteers' professional military bearing, including uniforms.|$|E
25|$|Downriver {{transport}} {{could be}} quite fast for the day. A traveler bound from Walla Walla would take the stage to Wallula, board the Colonel Wright or another steamer, then head downriver to Celilo. After a bumpy ride over the portage, the traveler would arrive at The Dalles where an <b>overnight</b> <b>stay</b> would be necessary {{at one of the}} hotels. The next morning the traveler would board a steamboat on the middle river, perhaps the Oneonta, for a morning run down to the Upper Cascades. There again the traveler disembarked, usually on the favored north side, and rode on the portage railway to the landing at the Lower Cascades. There, a steamer, possibly the Wilson G. Hunt, then ran downriver to Portland, which the traveler reached some thirty hours after leaving Walla Walla, a feat which was considered remarkable at that time. The genius of the Oregon Steam Navigation Company was to control all the boats on all the steps of the staircase, and the portages too, thus achieving a monopoly on transport in the days before there were roads or railways capable of mounting any competition. The Wright was simply superb at making money, earning as much as $2,500 a trip in passenger fares alone.|$|E
