5000|$|The {{original}} version of Washer Toss created in Texas during the oil boom of 1901, {{there are no}} boards. The washers are 1-inch I.D., 2 1/2 inch O.D. x 1/8 inch thick. The PVC cups are either 3-inch, 3-inch or 4-inch (3 is the preferred size) I.D., 21 feet apart. The washer [...] "pits" [...] (where the cups are buried) should be approximately 48 inches square and consist of a sandy or loamy soil. The game is played to 21 points. The closest washer to the cup is awarded 1 point. A touching leaner is awarded 2 points. A [...] "see though leaner [...] " [...] - any washer protruding the hole {{over the edge of}} the inside of the cup - is awarded 3 points. A [...] "ringer" [...] gets you 5 points.

Each license [...] "contained a provision {{to the effect}} that the licensee agrees, while the agreement is in force, that it will not manufacture any other form of non-tangling spring washers except those covered by the patent in suit."

They are installed just like any <b>other</b> <b>washer,</b> after which the sides of the tab are bent up to make contact with the sides of the head of the fastener. One side of the tab is longer than the other with a small hole at the top, through which safety wire is threaded. Once the Safety Wire is properly installed, the sides of the tab transfer the force of the safety wire to the fastener, as though the fastener itself had been drilled and had the safety wire run though it.|$|R

Group 30 focused on the filtration part of the project and worked closely with Group 12 on integrating the filters {{with the rest of the}} system.

Horseshoes involves players throwing horseshoes at stakes in the ground, {{with the goal of}} the horseshoe becoming wrapped around the stake (known as a [...] "ringer") or the nearest to the stake compared to the <b>others.</b> <b>Washer</b> pitching (also referred to as washers, washer toss, huachas, washoes and Texas horseshoes) involves players in teams tossing washers toward a hole or box. Many variations of the game exist, and it has been described as similar to horseshoes. Lawn darts involves throwing large darts at targets that are placed on the ground. Lawn darts have been subjected to product recalls at times, due to children dying from head wounds from the darts or otherwise becoming injured by them. In the United States in 1988, the Consumer Product Safety Commission banned the sale of lawn darts. They were also banned in Canada in 1989. Ladder Toss [...] involves throwing stringed balls at racks with three rungs, with points earned when the stringed balls are wrapped around a rung. Ladder Golf is a patented and trademarked ladder ball lawn game. Cornhole, also called bean bag, is a simple lawn game involving throwing bags of corn or beanbags at a partially raised board that has a hole atop it. Points are earned for bags going through the hole or remaining on the board.

The game evolved into KanJam, which also involves slamming the disc into a can, along with points earned for the thrown disc hitting the can.|$|R
