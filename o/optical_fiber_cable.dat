5|$|Northrop Grumman and Raytheon {{decided in}} 2002 to locate its ground station for National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System, the {{successor}} of EOS, to Helsinki, Finland, instead of Svalbard. The reason was lack of <b>optical</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>cable</b> {{connection to the}} archipelago. NSC took initiative to build such a cable in July 2002 and gained interest from NASA, NOAA and Telenor. The cable was financed by the satellite operators paying the same fee for the transmission of data {{as they would have}} to pay for a satellite connection until the cable was paid for. A 40 million United States dollar contract was signed with Tyco International for two cables between Harstad on the mainland and Longyearbyen. Construction started in June 2003 and was completed in January 2004.|$|E
25|$|Three key {{characteristics}} of fiber optic waveguides {{can be affected}} by environmental conditions: strength, attenuation and resistance to losses caused by microbending. External <b>optical</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>cable</b> jackets and buffer tubes protect glass optical fiber from environmental conditions that can affect the fiber’s performance and long-term durability. On the inside, coatings ensure {{the reliability of the}} signal being carried and help minimize attenuation due to microbending.|$|E
25|$|The fiber {{is used in}} woven {{rope and}} in cable, where the fibers are kept {{parallel}} within a polyethylene sleeve. The cables {{have been used in}} suspension bridges such as the bridge at Aberfeldy in Scotland. They have also been used to stabilize cracking concrete cooling towers by circumferential application followed by tensioning to close the cracks. Kevlar is widely used as a protective outer sheath for <b>optical</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>cable,</b> as its strength protects the cable from damage and kinking. When used in this application it is commonly known by the trademarked name Parafil.|$|E

25|$|Data {{communications}} {{are provided}} by several companies. Telstra was the first company to provide dial-up Internet access via the Ballarat exchange, however the first network for broadband Internet access available in the city was a hybrid <b>optical</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>cable</b> and coaxial cable built by Neighbourhood Cable in 2001. Since then, Telstra and Optus have entered the Ballarat market, providing Asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) services for residential Internet access from four main exchanges—Ballarat, Wendouree (Howitt Street), Sebastopol (Skipton Street) and Alfredton (Cuthberts Road). These companies also provide mobile data access Evolved HSPA and since late 2011 3GPP Long Term Evolution (4G). Ballarat's rollout of the National Broadband Network (NBN) is seen as vital for the city's growing IT industry. During Ballarat's first stage NBN rollout in 2012, 17,800 homes will be directly connected to the network via optical fibre cable.|$|E
25|$|Extrinsic {{fiber optic}} sensors use an <b>optical</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>cable,</b> {{normally}} a multi-mode one, to transmit modulated light from either a non-fiber optical sensor—or an electronic sensor connected to an optical transmitter. A major benefit of extrinsic sensors is {{their ability to}} reach otherwise inaccessible places. An example is the measurement of temperature inside aircraft jet engines by using a fiber to transmit radiation into a radiation pyrometer outside the engine. Extrinsic sensors {{can be used in}} the same way to measure the internal temperature of electrical transformers, where the extreme electromagnetic fields present make other measurement techniques impossible. Extrinsic sensors measure vibration, rotation, displacement, velocity, acceleration, torque, and twisting. A solid state version of the gyroscope, using the interference of light, has been developed. The fiber optic gyroscope (FOG) has no moving parts, and exploits the Sagnac effect to detect mechanical rotation.|$|E
2500|$|The Svalbard Undersea Cable System is a twin {{submarine}} communications cable which connects Svalbard to {{the mainland}} of Norway. The two <b>optical</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>cable</b> consist of two segments, from Harstad to Breivika in Andøy, and from Breivika to Hotellneset near Longyearbyen in Svalbard. The segments from Harstad to Breivika are [...] long, respectively, and the segments from Breivika to Hotellneset [...] Each consists of eight fiber pairs and there are installed twenty optical communications repeaters on each segment. Each segment has a speed of 10gigabits per second (Gb/s), with a future potential capacity of 2,500Gbit/s. The system is now the sole telecommunications link to the archipelago.|$|E
