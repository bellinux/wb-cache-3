5|$|To promote The Unraveling, Rise Against toured {{extensively}} throughout North America and Europe. While on tour, Wleklinski {{left the}} band due to personal differences with McIlrath. Rumor spread that Wleklinski was fired because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>long</b> hair, although McIlrath derided these claims. Phillip Hill stood in as lead guitarist, and Kevin White was eventually {{hired as a}} replacement. A few months later, White left the band, and Todd Mohney was recruited as the new lead guitarist.|$|E
5|$|By 1963, {{following}} some 15 {{years of}} unrelenting {{pressure from the}} police and the ABC, Stoumen decided he was no longer able financially to sustain the fight. The cost <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>long</b> legal battle was more than $38,000. Sarria tried to enlist the owners of the city's other gay bars to help Stoumen pay his legal bills, but none offered any assistance. The ABC lifted the bar's liquor license in 1963, the night before its annual Halloween party. After a final defiant Halloween celebration at which only non-alcoholic beverages were served and an attempt to survive on food and soft drink sales, the Black Cat closed down for good in February 1964.|$|E
5|$|The {{designs for}} Fort Tigné were {{eventually}} made in 1792, possibly {{due to the}} threat of a French invasion. It was commissioned by Grand Master Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc, and was designed by the newly appointed engineer of the Order, Antoine Étienne de Tousard. Construction began in 1793 under the supervision of capomastro Antonio Cachia, and was completed in July 1795. The fort was named after the knight François René Jacob de Tigné, the nephew of the military engineer René Jacob de Tigné, in recognition <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>long</b> years of service with the Order. Tigné also paid 1000 scudi for the construction of the new fort, while de Rohan paid about 6000 scudi. Another 500 scudi were donated by the Bali de Tillet, {{while the rest of the}} funds were paid by the Fondazione Manoel.|$|E

5|$|The {{sketches}} {{he made in}} the Alhambra {{formed a}} major source for his work from that time on. He also studied {{the architecture of the}} Mezquita, the Moorish mosque of Cordoba. This {{turned out to be the}} last <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>long</b> study journeys; after 1937, his artworks were created in his studio rather than in the field. His art correspondingly changed sharply from being mainly observational, with a strong emphasis on the realistic details of things seen in nature and architecture, to being the product of his geometric analysis and his visual imagination. All the same, even his early work already shows his interest in the nature of space, the unusual, perspective, and multiple points of view.|$|E
5|$|Though Wyatt {{received}} {{bullet holes}} in both sides <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>long</b> coat and another in his boot heel, he never received even a scratch from any bullet. After emptying his shotgun, Wyatt fired his pistol, mortally wounding Johnny Barnes {{in the chest and}} wounding Milt Hicks in the arm. Vermillion tried to retrieve his rifle wedged in the scabbard under his fallen horse, exposing himself to the Cowboys' gunfire. Doc Holliday helped him get to cover. Wyatt had trouble remounting his horse because his cartridge belt had slipped down his legs. He was finally able to get on his horse, and {{with the rest of the}} posse retreated.|$|E
5|$|Josquin likely {{learned his}} craft {{in his home}} region in the North, in France, and then in Italy {{when he went to}} Milan and Rome. His early sacred works emulate the contrapuntal {{complexity}} and ornamented, melismatic lines of Ockeghem and his contemporaries, {{but at the same time}} he was learning his contrapuntal technique he was acquiring an Italianate idiom for his secular music: after all, he was surrounded by Italian popular music in Milan. By the end <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>long</b> creative career, which spanned approximately 50 productive years, he had developed a simplified style in which each voice of a polyphonic composition exhibited free and smooth motion, and close attention was paid to clear setting of text as well as clear alignment of text with musical motifs. While other composers were influential on the development of Josquin's style, especially in the late 15th century, he himself became the most influential composer in Europe, especially after the development of music printing, which was concurrent with the years of his maturity and peak output. This event made his influence even more decisive than it might otherwise have been.|$|E
50|$|Edward Elgar's Violin Concerto in B minor, Op. 61, is one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>longest</b> orchestral compositions, and {{the last}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> works to gain {{immediate}} popular success.|$|R
50|$|The poem {{comprises}} eight stanzas of ten lines, {{making it}} one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>longest</b> poems. The rhyming scheme is a,b,a,b,c,d,e,c,d,e,f - (a rhyme scheme used in various of Keats' odes).|$|R
50|$|Upon {{conclusion}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>longest</b> novel, Datang Shuanglong Zhuan, Huang has {{commented that}} he would like to follow in the footstep of Louis Cha and to revise and improve his released novels.|$|R
5|$|Just a {{year later}} he again moved, {{becoming}} full captain on the 15,000-ton liner SS Minnedosa – an older ship that transported immigrants to Canada. Stuart was {{one of a number of}} Royal Naval Reserve officers employed by Canadian Pacific, part of a deliberate recruitment policy by the company. In 1929, he was given his biggest command yet as he took over the newly completed 20,000-ton ocean liner SS Duchess of York. He commanded her for five years along her route from Liverpool to Saint John, New Brunswick stopping at Belfast and Greenock. He also briefly commanded her on the New York City to Bermuda route. It was during this period, in 1929, that he was awarded the Decoration for Officers of the Royal Naval Reserve (RD) in honour <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>long</b> service and in 1935 he was made a full Naval Reserve Captain. He maintained his connection with the RNR throughout his life, becoming Honorary President of the RNR Officer's Club and a part-time naval aide-de-camp to King George VI in 1941 – a position he held part-time throughout World War II. A special warrant was written in 1927 that allowed him to fly the Blue Ensign from any ship, mercantile or military, which he commanded.|$|E
5|$|Mohamed was the {{youngest}} person to represent Somalia at the London Games {{at the age of}} 18. He had not participated in any previous Olympic Games. In an interview with The Guardian before the Games, Mohamed said he wanted people to see a Somali athlete competing at the Olympics and wanted to influlence the international community's view of his country away from being a nation afflicted by war and without any development. He wanted to win a medal because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>long</b> training routine. Mohamed was drawn in the men's 1500 metres second heat on 3 August, finishing 13th out of 14 athletes, with a time of three minutes and 46.16 seconds. He finished ahead of Yemen's Nabil Al-Garbi (three minutes and 55.46 seconds) but behind Jamale Aarrass of France (three minutes and 45.13 seconds) in a heat led by Saudi Arabia's Mohammed Shaween (three minutes and 39.42 seconds). Overall Mohamed placed 38th out of 43 participants, and did not progress into the semi-finals after finishing 6.21 seconds slower than the slowest athlete in his heat who made the later stages.|$|E
5|$|On June 19, 1964, Kennedy was a {{passenger}} {{in a private}} Aero Commander 680 airplane that was flying in bad weather from Washington to Massachusetts. The plane crashed into an apple orchard in the western Massachusetts town of Southampton on the final approach to the Barnes Municipal Airport in Westfield. The pilot and Edward Moss (one of Kennedy's aides) were killed. Kennedy was pulled from the wreckage by fellow Senator Birch Bayh and spent months in a hospital recovering from a severe back injury, a punctured lung, broken ribs and internal bleeding. He suffered chronic back pain {{for the rest of}} his life as a result of the accident. Kennedy took advantage <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>long</b> convalescence to meet with academics and study issues more closely, and the hospital experience triggered his lifelong interest in the provision of health care services. His wife Joan did the campaigning for him in the regular 1964 U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts, and he defeated his Republican opponent by a three-to-one margin.|$|E

50|$|One <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>longest</b> lasting {{legacies}} was his {{bringing a}} group of Spanish performers, known as the Spanish Students, to the United States. These performers inspired imitators and {{gave rise to the}} widespread playing of the mandolin in the United States, where it was previously unknown.|$|R
50|$|Even though Octavian {{wanted to}} {{immediately}} pursue Antony and Cleopatra, many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> veterans wanted to retire {{and return to}} private life. Octavian allowed many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>longest</b> serving veterans (as many as 10 legions by some accounts) to retire. Many of those legionaries could trace their service to Julius Caesar some 20 years earlier.|$|R

25|$|Early in life, Ford's {{politics}} were conventionally progressive; his favorite presidents were Democrats Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy and Republican Abraham Lincoln. But despite these leanings, many {{thought he was}} a Republican because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>long</b> association with actors John Wayne, James Stewart, Maureen O'Hara and Ward Bond.|$|E
