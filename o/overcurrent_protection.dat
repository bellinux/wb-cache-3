25|$|While powered (energized), photomultipliers must be {{shielded}} from ambient light {{to prevent their}} destruction through overexcitation. In some applications this protection is accomplished mechanically by electrical interlocks or shutters that protect the tube when the photomultiplier compartment is opened. Another option is to add <b>overcurrent</b> <b>protection</b> in the external circuit, {{so that when the}} measured anode current exceeds a safe limit, the high voltage is reduced.|$|E
25|$|Some {{companies}} manufacture resettable miniature thermal circuit breakers, which screw into a fuse socket. Some installations {{use these}} Edison-base circuit breakers. However, any such breaker sold today does have one flaw. It may {{be installed in}} a circuit-breaker box with a door. If so, if the door is closed, the door may hold down the breaker's reset button. While in this state, the breaker is effectively useless: it does not provide any <b>overcurrent</b> <b>protection.</b>|$|E
25|$|A residual-current {{circuit breaker}} cannot remove all risk of {{electric}} shock or fire. In particular, an RCD alone will not detect overload conditions, phase-to-neutral short circuits or phase-to-phase short circuits (see three-phase electric power). Over-current protection (fuses or circuit breakers) must be provided. Circuit breakers that combine the functions of an RCD with <b>overcurrent</b> <b>protection</b> respond to both types of fault. These are known as RCBOs and are available in 2-, 3- and 4-pole configurations. RCBOs will typically have separate circuits for detecting current imbalance and for overload current but use a common interrupting mechanism.|$|E
50|$|For each phase, {{power is}} fed along a busbar. In {{split-phase}} panels, separate busbars are fed {{directly from the}} incomer, which allows RCDs {{to be used to}} protect groups of circuits.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{approach}} to the distributed generation system protection coordination based on directional <b>overcurrent</b> <b>protections</b> with inverse-time characteristics. The key question of protection coordination is the determination of correct values of all inverse-time characteristics coefficients. The coefficients must be correctly chosen considering the sufficiently short tripping times and the sufficiently long selectivity times. In the paper {{a new approach}} to protection coordination is designed, in which not only some, but all the required types of short-circuit contributions are taken into account. In radial systems, if the pickup currents are correctly chosen, protection coordination for maximum contributions is enough to ensure selectivity times for all the required short-circuit types. In distributed generation systems, due to different contributions flowing through the primary and selective protections, coordination for maximum contributions is not enough, but all the short-circuit types must be taken into account, and the protection coordination becomes a complex problem. A possible solution to the problem, based on an appropriately designed optimization, has been proposed in the paper. By repeating a simple optimization considering only one short-circuit type, the protection coordination considering all the required short-circuit types has been achieved. To show the importance of considering all the types of short-circuit contributions, setting optimizations with one (the highest) and all the types of short-circuit contributions have been performed. Finally, selectivity time values are explored throughout the entire protected section, and both the settings are compared...|$|R

25|$|Renewable fuses (rewirable or cartridge) allow user replacement, {{but this}} can be {{hazardous}} as {{it is easy to}} put a higher-rated or double fuse element (link or wire) into the holder (overfusing), or simply fitting it with copper wire or even a totally different type of conducting object (coins, hairpins, paper clips, nails, etc.) to the existing carrier. One form of fuse box abuse was to put a penny in the socket, which defeated <b>overcurrent</b> <b>protection</b> and resulted in a dangerous condition. Such tampering will not be visible without full inspection of the fuse. Fuse wire was never used in North America for this reason, although renewable fuses continue to be made for distribution boards.|$|E
25|$|A third wire, {{called the}} bond (or earth) wire, is often {{connected}} between non-current-carrying metal enclosures and earth ground. This conductor provides protection from electric shock due to accidental contact of circuit conductors with the metal chassis of portable appliances and tools. Bonding all non-current-carrying metal parts into one complete system ensures {{there is always}} a low electrical impedance path to ground sufficient to carry any fault current {{for as long as it}} takes for the system to clear the fault. This low impedance path allows the maximum amount of fault current, causing the <b>overcurrent</b> <b>protection</b> device (breakers, fuses) to trip or burn out as quickly as possible, bringing the electrical system to a safe state. All bond wires are bonded to ground at the main service panel, as is the neutral/identified conductor if present.|$|E
25|$|An RCD {{does not}} provide {{protection}} against unexpected or dangerously high current (called spikes or surges) when current is in the usual wires in the circuit, therefore it cannot replace a fuse or protect against overheating or fire risk due to overcurrent (overload) or short circuits if the fault {{does not lead to}} current leakage. Therefore, RCDs are often used or integrated as a single product along with some kind of circuit breaker, such as a fuse or miniature circuit breaker (MCB), which adds protection in the event of excessive current in the circuit (the resulting RCD with <b>overcurrent</b> <b>protection</b> called an RCBO). RCDs also cannot detect the situation where a human accidentally touches both conductors at the same time, since the current through an expected device, an unexpected route, or a human, are indistinguishable if the current returns through the expected conductor.|$|E

Solar panels with mono crystalline silicon solar cells are mounted on both scientific and avionic gondola. A power conditioning board with Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) is designed and currently tested. This board is called MC 2 : Communicant Conditioning Module. It allows controlling a Li Ion battery charge through PWM regulators. Moreover, outlets ON/OFF commutations associated to <b>overcurrent’s</b> <b>protections</b> are implemented in this board. The battery active thermal control {{is made by}} MC 2 autonomously. The main design drivers are mass, costs and efficiency. A CAN Bus between MC 2 and On Board Computer allows to have a commandability and observability of MC 2 through OBC.

This overall architecture allows both chains to be designed without SPF free constrains. This paper describes the overall requirements and the design of MC 2. The main innovation described in this paper is the way to implement MPPT: the MPPT algorithm is performed at the output of the power converter. This MPPT extracts maximum power of both solar panel characteristics and power converter. The main advantage is that this MPPT uses only one existing sensor (output current of boost converter) instead of using current and voltage sensor of each solar panel...|$|R

The introduction of SFCs has significant implications on the protection systems of the 50 kV traction network. The traditional distance protection calculation method does not work in this configuration because of the effect that the SFC in combination with the remote grid has on the apparent impedance, and was substantially reviewed. The standard <b>overcurrent</b> (OC) <b>protection</b> scheme is not suitable due to the minimum fault level being below the maximum load level and was revised to incorporate directionality and under-voltage inhibit.

40|$|Abstract—Determination of {{the minimum}} break point set (MBPS) in {{interconnected}} networks is the key step during calcula-tion and setting of <b>overcurrent</b> relays <b>protection</b> values. Recently, two separate approaches based on expert system and MBPS have been developed respectively. The first one considers the effects of fault level, network configuration, pilot protection and other protection systems. The second one defines protection relay de-pendency dimension (PRDD) for finding MBPS. By comparison of PRDD in a multi-loop network, the MBPS can be determined, {{and the process of}} comparison will not stop until the MBPS of the network is discovered. This paper introduces a new method which takes into account expert rules as well as MBPS simultaneously in the frame of the new objective function of genetic algorithm. It can also generate a new MBPS after each coordination process. The method is applied to the 8 -buses and the IEEE 30 -buses networks. The obtained results have revealed that the new method is accurate and capable of reducing miscoordinations.

The basic idea of adaptive relay protection is to protect the power system as much as possible to improve the performance of the protection. Adaptive relay protection has the advantages of improving the response of the system, enhancing the reliability and improving the economic benefits. It has a wide application prospect in the field of distance protection, transformer protection, generator protection, autoreclosure and so on. Research has discovered that, to achieve the protection of the system adaptive to the operation mode and fault status, more detailed system operation and fault information are required through communication network.|$|R
