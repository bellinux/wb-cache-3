This proved to be the case; Canada received no compensation for the raids and no significant trade advantages in the settlement, which required Canada to open her waters to American fishermen.

5|$|When Russia {{invaded the}} Turkish Balkans in 1853, fears of Russian {{dominance}} in the Mediterranean and Middle East led Britain and France to invade the Crimean Peninsula to destroy Russian naval capabilities. The ensuing Crimean War (1854–56), which involved new techniques of modern warfare, was the only global war fought between Britain and another imperial power during the Pax Britannica and was a resounding defeat for Russia. The situation remained unresolved in Central Asia for two more decades, with Britain annexing Baluchistan in 1876 and Russia annexing Kirghizia, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan. For a while it appeared that another war would be inevitable, but the two countries reached an agreement on their respective spheres of influence in the region in 1878 and on all <b>outstanding</b> <b>matters</b> in 1907 with {{the signing of the}} Anglo-Russian Entente.

This is followed by an extensive exploration of the parameter space of the E₆-inspired supersymmetric standard model (E₆SSM).

40|$|We {{study the}} {{generation}} of structures in Saturn's B-ring under the common action of self-gravitation, inelastic collisions, and rotation. Folowing a hydrodynamical approach the ring corresponds to a viscous fluid. Then {{the state of the}} rings is governed by the surface density dependence of the dynamic viscosity, d(vo) /do, with v being the kinematic viscosity and o the surface density. Several authors have calculated v and e: &# 61 d ln(vo) /d ln o. In all of their models e takes a positive quantity. Then two different instabilities may arise. For all e below a small positive number the ring is securlarlyunstable. The wavelengths of the fastest growing modes are of the order of one Jeans length, i. e. 80 - 120 m in our case. For a sufficient large positive e another unstable branch appears: The ring is overstable. Here individual particle oscillate and the hydrodynamic picture is a standing wave with rapidly growing amplitudes. Again, the wavelength of the fastest growing mode is in the range of about 80 m. Since the ring deviates considerably from a classical gas, it is rather difficult to determine the quamtity e. Although this problem has already been an <b>outstanding</b> <b>matter</b> of investigation for a long time, a generally accepted solution is stillmissing. For that reason we restrict our stability analysis to the parameterized representation of v with v x o_ and &# 61 e - 1 &# 61 const and discuss both the secular instability, which sets already in for small positive e if self-gravitation is included, and the overstable modes that are produced by sufficiently large e> 0, even without self-gravitation. In this paper we derive the quasi-linear perturbation equations and solve toe corresponding initial-boundary value problem. The ring's gravitational potential is also treated in a self-consistent way. The aim of the paper is to show that the disk is probably unstable or overstable and small-scale perturbations exhibit a remarkable intensification within a few orbital periods...|$|R

The interactions of sovereign debt management (SDM) with monetary conditions and financial stability was heightened in these historically unusual circumstances.

The report concludes that in such circumstances, or where financial systems are still developing, there is benefit in debt managers taking a broad view of cost and risk. Central banks can likewise benefit from keeping abreast of SDM activities. Recent experience confirms that medium-term strategic outcomes for the maturity structure and risk characteristics of <b>outstanding</b> debt do <b>matter,</b> for financial stability in particular.
