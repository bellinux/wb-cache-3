To {{the right of the}} driveway is the Oppenheimer part of the beach. The southwestern part is Gibney. While they are nearly the same beach, the Oppenheimer house is open to the public, but the Gibney house sections are private. In the Virgin Islands, public domain property is from the sea to the first line of vegetation. Behind the first line of vegetation, the Gibney Beach property belongs to the Gibney family. Gibney has appeared on commercials and in magazines. It has also been used by Hollywood as settings for the motion pictures “The Four Seasons” and “Columbus”.|$|E
25|$|Traditional Japanese {{table setting}} {{is to place}} a bowl of rice <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>left</b> and to place a bowl of miso soup on your right side at the table. Behind these, each okazu is served on its own {{individual}} plate. Based on the standard three okazu formula, behind the rice and soup are three flat plates to hold the three okazu; one to far back left, one at far back right, {{and one in the}} center. Pickled vegetables are often served on the side but are not counted as part of the three okazu. Chopsticks are generally placed at the very front of the tray near the diner with pointed ends facing left and supported by a chopstick rest, or hashioki.|$|E

500|$|Concerned for his health, Irving's {{brothers}} financed {{an extended}} tour of Europe from 1804 to 1806. Irving bypassed {{most of the}} sites and locations considered essential {{for the development of}} an upwardly mobile young man, to the dismay of his brother William. William wrote that, though he was pleased his brother's health was improving, he did not like the choice to [...] "gallop through Italy... leaving Florence <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>left</b> and Venice on your right". Instead, Irving honed the social and conversational skills that would later make him one of the world's most in-demand guests. [...] "I endeavor to take things as they come with cheerfulness", Irving wrote, [...] "and when I cannot get a dinner to suit my taste, I endeavor to get a taste to suit my dinner". While visiting Rome in 1805, Irving struck up a friendship with the American painter Washington Allston and nearly allowed himself to be persuaded into following Allston into a career as a painter. [...] "My lot in life, however", Irving said later, [...] "was differently cast".|$|E

2500|$|Section 10: [...] Cross Stairfoot Lane {{and join}} a {{bridleway}} opposite the car park, continue along the obvious path as it rises uphill avoiding any deviations {{to reach a}} waymarker post indicating bridleway directions. At this point the old gateway is long since missing (and the stile to the right inevitably unused). Go through the gap and enter the grassy field to follow the field edge on your right to reach a wide, tree/bush lined track (with Headingley Golf Course <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>left)</b> to reach King Lane at Golf Farm. Cross the road and turn left following King Lane. Do not walk the main road (it can be very busy), instead take the obvious path that uses the road verge.|$|E

[...] Cross over turning right, {{and take the}} first left, Mill Pond Lane, then take the footpath immediately to the left. [...] After a bridge over Meanwood Beck, turn right for approx 50 metres then turn left, following the path round the millpond, which served the former Meanwood Tannery, now converted to residential flats. [...] The path goes sharp right through some allotments, then reaches housing and just before reaching the road at Hollin Drive turn right to cross Meanwood Beck at a waymarker post.You pass the disused cricket ground of Highbury CC on your right and turn left on a small bridge over the Beck to enter the picnic area of Meanwood Park.|$|E
2500|$|From here, hikers {{can take}} one of two routes: either turn right (west), walk several hundred yards, [...] and look {{carefully}} {{for a pair of}} cairns in the woods <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>left</b> marking {{the north end of the}} Twilight Park Trail (not yet official, but well-marked) OR turn left and proceed around the mountain, past one of the easily spotted plane wrecks. As the path curves to the right, you will eventually encounter a [...] cairn in the middle of the path marking the south end of the Twilight Park Trail. [...] A combination of smaller cairns, surveyor's tape flags and old blue paint blazes have been used by various stealth maintainers over the years to keep this wet and sometimes hard-to-spot route marked. While not seriously steep, it is almost constantly ascending, responsible for the last 450 vertical feet up the mountain in less than a mile. [...] The southerly approach is probably best, since the steepest portions of the ascent are to the south and are best handled going up rather than down.|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} {{main building}} {{was constructed in}} 1934. This brick veneer building consisted of five classrooms, an auditorium, and two offices (one of which served as the library). Otto Holloway served as the principal. An elementary wing {{was added to the}} original building in 1937 which contained eight classrooms over a spacious basement area. This building was nearly identical to the Red Bay High School constructed in 1927. The building was a brick [...] "U," [...] {{one of the most popular}} school designs in Alabama at the time.

"Hohenfriedberg, at {{the other}} corner of our battle-stage, {{on the road to}} Landshut, is a Village of no great compass; but sticks pleasantly together, does not straggle in the usual way; climbs steep against its Gallows-Hill (now called 'SIEGESBERG, Victory Hill,' with some tower or steeple-monument on it, built by subscription); and would look better, if trimmed a little and habitually well swept.

5000|$|In 1927, a {{new school}} site was selected, and {{a new school}} built for $45,000. Since this construction, the {{location}} of the school has not changed.

The building housing the home economics and agriculture departments was located on the left of the main school building. At a later date, classrooms were added to the left wing of the main building. Due to the slope of the site, a ground-level lunchroom was included in this addition. With steps leading from the hallway, the first cafeteria available to Red Bay students became operational.|$|R
