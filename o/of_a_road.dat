5|$|In {{a letter}} dated 12 June 1842 in the Colonial Secretary's Records, Marshall Clifton, Chief Commissioner of the Western Australian Land Company, {{wrote of the}} need for an {{improved}} Perth–Fremantle–Bunbury road. On a special trip he took in the previous October to look for a new route, two surveyors gave their approval to the proposed coastal route, with a ferry across the estuary. Governor John Hutt approved of the idea <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>road,</b> but thought a ferry would be impractical, at least during winter, and that the lack of public funds made it impossible. Clifton continued to write letters to the Colonial Secretary advocating the construction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>road.</b>|$|E

5|$|Talbot {{received}} {{a grant of}} $250 in September 1804 for the construction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>road</b> between Brantford and Delhi. John Bostwick would survey the route that year; however, funding shortages would halt construction in 1806.|$|E
5|$|The roadway on {{its current}} {{alignment}} has existed {{since at least}} 1926, however there are records <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>road</b> between Paterson and Prosser since 1906. The highway was designated Secondary State Highway 8E (SSH8E) in 1937, but the route number was changed to SR221 during the 1964 state highway renumbering.|$|E
5|$|There is {{historical}} evidence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>road</b> linking Haymarket with Wardour Street in 1585, roughly {{in the present}} location of Coventry Street. This pre-dated Leicester Square, and ran as far as St. Martin's Field, stopping short of St. Martin's Lane.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, the {{granular}} pavement {{section of}} Highway 2 south of Watrous was tested {{with a cold}} in-place recycling or “CIR” method to rehabilitate highways. This CIR process is a cost-effective method which recycles the top surface <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>road.</b> This pulverized material is mixed with asphalt emulsion and spread and compacted back onto the highway surface. This surface is then recovered with a new seal dependent on traffic volume.|$|E
5|$|In {{classical}} antiquity, {{the western}} Istria route {{was first used}} by Via Flavia in the classical antiquity, but the roads in the area declined in the Middle Ages and subsequent division of the Istrian Peninsula by the Republic of Venice and the Habsburg Empire was not conductive to development <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>road</b> system. In the 19th century, the First French Empire started road construction, including the TriestePula route now largely followed by D21. The present-day D21 route {{was a part of}} M2 Adriatic Highway route after the Second World War. It was made a separate state road and assigned its present route number in 1997.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries trails were formed, often by the {{movement}} of game herds, that could be traveled on horseback. However, vehicular access to the summit was practically impossible until the construction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>road</b> in 1964, {{and it continues to}} be restricted. Today, multiple trails to the summit exist, in various states of use.|$|E
5|$|Metcalfe {{opposed the}} spoils {{system and the}} {{doctrine}} of nullification. He favored protective tariffs and federal aid for internal improvements. He oversaw the establishment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>road</b> connecting Shelbyville to Louisville. When President Andrew Jackson vetoed federal aid for a turnpike connecting Maysville and Lexington, Metcalfe continued constructing it with state funds. (The road is now a portion of U.S. Route 68.) Metcalfe's term also saw the commissioning of the state's first railroad {{and the beginning of}} plans for a canal at the Falls of the Ohio. At the governor's recommendation, the state legislature approved additional aid for education, and the creation of district schools.|$|E
5|$|Perseverance Road, {{and some}} housing, defines {{the western edge}} of much of the park. William Haines was the {{district}} clerk for Tea Tree Gully from 1867 to 1902 and Member of Parliament for Gumeracha from 1878 to 1884. Since 1862, he had lobbied for construction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>road</b> to link Tea Tree Gully to Anstey Hill Road. The 1½ mile road was eventually approved and subsequently opened in 1880. Known as Haines' Folly before its completion, it was officially called Haines' Perseverance Road at the opening ceremony.|$|E

There have been occasions where this designation {{has been used to}} indicate motorway bypasses <b>of</b> <b>an</b> existing <b>road,</b> but the original retains the <b>A</b> <b>road</b> designation, for example A3(M), A329(M), A38(M), A48(M) and A627(M).|$|R
5|$|The Amina Bokhary {{controversy}} {{occurred in}} Hong Kong in 2010 involving the assault conviction {{of a wealthy}} woman from a well-connected political family. Amina Mariam Bokhary, 32, received a non-custodial sentence and a one-year driving ban following an incident in the aftermath <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>road</b> traffic accident when she struck several police officers. As she had committed similar offences in 2001 and 2008, her resulting probation was seen by some commentators as too lenient.|$|E
5|$|The Highway70 {{designation}} {{was first}} used along the Heenan Highway, connecting the Rainy River region to Kenora to provide the first Canadian road link to an area previously accessible only from the United States. In 1922, Kenora MPP Peter Heenan and Dr. McTaggart approached the government to lobby for construction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>road</b> between Nestor Falls and Kenora. Nestor Falls was the northernmost point accessible by road from the Rainy River area. Heenan would become the Minister of Lands and Forests in Mitch Hepburn's cabinet.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{evidence of}} human activity {{in what is now}} Salford is provided by the Neolithic flint arrow-heads and workings discovered on Kersal Moor and the River Irwell, suggesting that the area was inhabited 7–10,000 years ago. The raw material for such tools was scarce and unsuitable for working, and as a result they are not of the quality found elsewhere. Other finds include a neolithic axe-hammer found near Mode Wheel, during the excavation of the Manchester Ship Canal in 1890, and a Bronze Age cremation urn during the construction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>road</b> on the Broughton Hall estate in 1873.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} NY318 {{date back to}} the 19th century when the highway was part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>road</b> {{connecting}} the village of Phelps to a bridge over the Seneca River near Cayuga Lake. It was mostly designated as Route6-a, an unsigned legislative route, by the New York State Legislature in 1911. The section of Route6-a from West Junius to Halsey Corners was designated as New York State Route291 (west of Magee) and part of NY89 (east of Magee) as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. NY291 was removed in the 1940s.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} NY418 {{date back to}} the 19th century when Thurman Station and Warrensburg were first {{connected}} by way <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>road.</b> This highway was reconstructed by the state of New York during the early 1910s and added to the state highway system in 1915. It was designated as NY418 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. The highway has remained mainly unchanged since, save for the replacement of its bridges over the Schroon and the Hudson Rivers in the 1930s and 1940s, respectively.|$|E
