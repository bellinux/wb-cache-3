25|$|The use of full cutoff {{fixtures}} help {{to reduce}} sky glow by preventing light from escaping above the horizontal. Full cutoff typically reduces {{the visibility of}} the lamp and reflector within a luminaire, so the effects of glare are also reduced. Campaigners also commonly argue that full cutoff fixtures are more efficient than other fixtures, since light that would otherwise have escaped into the atmosphere may instead be directed towards the ground. However, full cutoff fixtures may also trap more light in the fixture than other <b>types</b> of <b>luminaires,</b> corresponding to lower luminaire efficiency, suggesting a re-design of some luminaires may be necessary.|$|R

Nowadays, a large number of people spend practically all their productive time in the presence of the artificial lighting system. This places considerable demands on the quality of this artificial lighting system. One of the indicators of the quality of the lighting system is the evaluation of glare. The UGR evaluation methodology is currently used to evaluate glare. However, the UGR rating has its limitations. These limitations include ambiguous assessments of luminaires with non-uniform luminous surface (so - called non - uniform luminaires). This diploma thesis deals with the issue of discomfort glare of non-uniform luminaires. The aim is to make a literature review of this issue.

40|$|AbstractIn {{building}} retrofit projects, numerous {{sources of}} uncertainty about building performance {{need to be}} addressed. Deterministic simulations are usually used to estimate the potential performance difference from a baseline building. This approach needs building model calibration. Varying uncertain building parameters could lead to orders of magnitude simulation times. For example, in a lighting retrofit project, uncertainty (e. g., lamp input wattage, and varying weather conditions may negatively affect model calibration and lighting energy savings, which increases the chance of default on performance contract. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} paper is to develop a method that can conduct risk analysis based on building model (e. g., building information modelling). A stochastic occupancy model is used to simulate the occupancy pattern. Two lighting control strategies (occupancy and daylight controls) and two <b>luminaire</b> <b>types</b> (LED and fluorescent) are considered. Historical weather data is analyzed using statistical analysis, and the extreme weather conditions are generated to evaluate the impact of weather conditions on the lighting and HVAC energy usage. Then, EnergyPlus is used to simulate the energy usage based on different lamp types, control strategies, occupancy patterns, and weather conditions. A surrogate model is developed by using a small sample size of simulation data to construct an approximation surface to enable fast computing time. This method can evaluate impact of uncertainty of risk factors (e. g., occupancy level, <b>luminaire</b> <b>type,</b> weather) on lighting and HVAC energy usage and lighting electricity demand. This method can also prioritize risk factors based on sensitivity analysis on building performance and help users to choose different lamp types to minimize risks...|$|R
40|$|Solid angle {{sampling}} is {{an important}} variance-reduced technique when solving global illumination problems by Monte Carlo methods. In this paper, we present an efficient solid angle sampling technique where a paraboloidal luminaire is taken as a case study. The efficiency of our technique {{is due to the}} fact that we employ a tight bounding volume to approximate the solid angle. Our technique includes three processes. The construction process builds a bounding volume. It is a convex, frustum-like polyhedron with a compromise between the tightness and the vertex numbers. The projection process approximates the solid angle as a convex spherical polygon on a unit hemisphere. Finally, the triangulation process triangulates the convex spherical polygon into spherical triangles for stratified sampling. We analyzed our technique in Monte Carlo direct lighting and Monte Carlo path tracing rendering algorithms. The results show that our technique provides up to 90 % sampling efficiency. The significance of the proposed technique is that solid angle sampling, from being not possible for the paraboloidal luminaire, is now feasible. In addition, this technique is efficient for sampling, and it is also applicable to other <b>types</b> of <b>luminaires,</b> such as cylindrical and conic luminaires...|$|R

This study assessed the illumination and the probable effects on visual fatigue and mental states in Velaiat hospital’s personnel of Damghan. Materials and Methods A case study design performed in indoor hospital working areas. Layout and <b>type</b> of <b>luminaires</b> were examined and interior illuminations were measured as proposed by IESNA (Illuminating Engineering Society of North America). A questionnaire was used to collect data and descriptive and analytical statistical analyses were conducted. Results Interior lighting measurements showed unacceptable levels of local illumination in 82. 3 percent of sections during day light hours and all sections during night hours. General levels of illumination were unacceptable for 83. 3 percent of section in day light and all sections in night hours. Uniformity ratios were unacceptable during day and night hours for 91 percent and 83 percent of sections, respectively. There is a significant relation between age and perceived favorable light, visual fatigue and mental states (P < 0. 05). We found significant relationships between the lighting type and illumination with visual fatigue and mental states (P < 0. 05). Conclusion Insufficient illumination and excessive artificial light may lead to visual fatigue and mental strain. Lighting design should account for acceptable quantity and similarity to daylight. * Corresponding Author: Research Center for Social Determinants of health, Semnan University of Medical Sciences.

40|$|The ASHRAE {{cooling load}} {{procedures}} employ a simple lighting heat gain model {{to account for}} the energy dissipated by lights. The simple lighting heat gain model requires knowledge of the conditioned space/ceiling plenum split in order to estimate how much of the lighting energy is transmitted to the conditioned space as heat gain. The model also requires the radiative/con-vective split in order to estimate how much of the lighting heat gain in the conditioned space is transferred as radiation and as convection. Experimental measurements of the lighting heat gain parameters were conducted for a range of contemporary luminaires in a full-scale test facility under realistic operating conditions. This paper presents experimental results along with their estimated uncertainties. The paper also discusses effects of various test parameters on the measured data. It is found that the lighting heat gain parameters are typically more sen-sitive to the <b>luminaire</b> <b>type</b> and the room airflow rate than to other parameters. Using different luminaires can result in an increase of 0. 20 for the space fraction, which is higher than the typ-ical uncertainty in the space fraction.

40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy is {{evaluating}} the Baker-Barry Tunnel {{as a potential}} GATEWAY Demonstrations project for deployment of solid-state lighting (SSL) technology. The National Park Service views this project as a possible proving ground and template for implementation of light-emitting diode (LED) luminaires in other tunnels, thereby expanding the estimated 40 % energy savings from 132 MWh/yr to a much larger figure nationally. Most of the energy savings in this application is attributable to the instant-restrike capability of LED products and to their high tolerance for frequent on/off switching, used here to separately control {{either end of the}} tunnel during daytime hours. Some LED luminaires rival or outperform their high-intensity discharge (HID) counterparts in terms of efficacy, but options are limited, and smaller lumen packages preclude true one-for-one equivalence. However, LED products continue to improve in efficacy and affordability at a rate unmatched by other light source technologies; the estimated simple payback period of eight years (excluding installation costs and maintenance savings) can be expected to improve with time. The proposed revisions to the existing high-pressure sodium (HPS) lighting system would require slightly increased controls complexity and significantly increased <b>luminaire</b> <b>types</b> and quantities. In exchange, substantial annual savings (from reduced maintenance and energy use) would be complemented by improved quantity and quality of illumination.

A computer program has been developed to determine criteria for calculation of the road light-ing based on visibility level to ensure driver comfort and safety. Five different arrangements, left hand single-sided, opposite, staggered, twin-bracket central and combined twin-bracket central and opposite are examined for 30 different road lighting luminaires. To examine {{the effect of}} the luminance uniformity on visibility level, average luminances of 1. 0; 1. 5; 2. 0; 2. 5 and 3. 0 cd/m 2 were obtained by changing the mounting height and luminaire spacing.

Research has found mixed results {{when it comes to}} selecting the correct lamp, but most researchers agree illumination levels benefit APs quality of life. Achieving higher illumination levels can be achieved by adding more luminaires to the ambient lighting layout, placing additional task lighting in specific locations, or using light therapy. Exposing APs to higher illumination levels can have positive behavioral benefits and help shift the circadian rhythm. Common problems such as aggression, sleepiness, and agitation can be reduced if proper lighting layouts or light therapy is used on a consistent basis.

40|$|Two mock-up office rooms, {{one with}} a spectrally {{tuneable}} LED lighting system {{and the other with}} a fluorescent lamp (FL) lighting system were built for user acceptance studies for office lighting. One room was illuminated with six LED luminaires and the other with six FL luminaires. Each LED luminaire has 480 LEDs (20 different LED types and 24 of each <b>type).</b> Each FL <b>luminaire</b> has eight fluorescent lamps, four with a correlated colour temperature of 4000 K and four of 6500 K. User acceptance studies in the office environments were conducted with 40 observers, each observer having 16 sessions (six LED spectral power distributions (SPDs) þ two FL SPDs and two illuminances (500 lux and 300 lux)). The observers performed office-related tasks while being totally immersed in one of these lighting conditions. The objective {{of this study was to}} verify previous results obtained in small-scale booth experiments and to further study peoples’ preferences for LED office lighting. The small-scale experiments showed that LEDs with a higher value of reference-based colour metrics (such as colour quality scale (CQS) colour preference scale) and with a higher value of area-based or volume-based metrics (such as CQS gamut area scale or gamut area index) were preferred by the observers. The office room study of the present work validated the findings of the earlier experiments but now in an office lighting environment. Furthermore, the observers preferred 4000 K to 6500 K at a light level of 500 lux and the light level of 500 lux over 300 lux.

40|$|This work {{starts with}} a short {{introduction}} in which the energy consumption, proportion {{of different types of}} light sources, and procedures that have been introduced concerning energy saving in outdoor lighting are overviewed. It is followed by a historical review and research related to aspects of the topic referred to in this work: the luminance method used for photometric dimensioning of road lighting, road surface classification practises, and mesopic photometry. The work continues with a study of road surface reflection characteristics. Road surface reflection measurements were made to study {{the current state of the}} pavement materials used on Finnish roads. Pavement samples were extracted from roads and the reflection tables of the pavement samples were measured. The pavement materials used in Finland are somewhat dark and diffuse and the standard reflection tables give an adequate fit for the degree of specularity but not for the degree of lightness. The spectral reflection properties of various types and differently coloured pavement samples were studied. The results indicate that light sources that have a higher spectral light output in the longer wavelength region, such as high pressure sodium lamps, are more energy-efficient in terms of light reflected from the pavements compared to the ones with a high output in the short wavelength region. In addition, pavement materials made out of recycled materials and local limestone were studied. Light pavement materials reflect more light than darker pavement materials, and energy could be saved by increasing the spacing of the poles for the luminaires or reducing the power consumption of the luminaires. The work continues with a study of mesopic dimensioning in road lighting. The luminous efficacy of various <b>types</b> of <b>luminaires</b> and the use of mesopic dimensioning in road lighting design were studied. The study is followed by a case study where high pressure sodium lamp street lighting was changed to LED street lighting. The energy consumption of the installation was calculated and mesopic dimensioning was used. The results show that energy savings are possible when mesopic dimensioning is used by reducing the power consumption of the luminaire or by increasing the spacing of the poles for the luminaires. The work continues by studying the differences in using the standard r-tables and the measured r-tables of the pavement used in the road lightning design on Finnish roads. It was found that the R 2 table should be used for road lighting design if the reflection property of the pavement is not known. The work is followed by a study of the use of light pavement materials and mesopic dimensioning. In this case the benefits of mesopic dimensioning are negligible when light pavement materials are used...|$|R
40|$|A new roadway {{lighting}} {{demonstration project}} was initiated in late 2010, which was planned {{in conjunction with}} other upgrades to NE Cully Boulevard, a residential collector road in the northeast area of Portland, OR. With the NE Cully Boulevard project, the Portland Bureau of Transportation hoped to demonstrate different light source technologies and different luminaires side-by-side. This report documents the initial performance of six different newly installed luminaires, including three LED products, one induction product, one ceramic metal halide product, and one high-pressure sodium (HPS) product that represented the baseline solution. It includes reported, calculated, and measured performance; evaluates the economic feasibility of each of the alternative luminaires; and documents user feedback collected from a group of local Illuminating Engineering Society (IES) members that toured the site. This report does not contain any long-term performance evaluations or laboratory measurements of luminaire performance. Although not all of the installed products performed equally, the alternative luminaires generally offered higher efficacy, more appropriate luminous intensity distributions, and favorable color quality when compared to the baseline HPS luminaire. However, some products did not provide sufficient illumination to all areas—vehicular drive lanes, bicycle lanes, and sidewalks—or would likely fail to meet design criteria {{over the life of the}} installation due to expected depreciation in lumen output. While the overall performance of the alternative luminaires was generally better than the baseline HPS luminaire, cost remains a significant barrier to widespread adoption. Based on the cost of the small quantity of luminaires purchased for this demonstration, the shortest calculated payback period for one of the alternative <b>luminaire</b> <b>types</b> was 17. 3 years. The luminaire prices were notably higher than typical prices for currently available luminaires purchased in larger quantities.

40|$|The {{commercial}} value of Cordyline is determined both by its red leaf colour and by the overall plant length. During winter, the growth rate slows down, {{and at the same}} time less red coloured leaves are formed. A greenhouse trial was organized to assess the possibility of improving the crop's market value by making use of artificial light. The experimental stand contained Cordyline cv. Prins Albert and received high pressure sodium light supplements from November 1990 to February 1991. Total day length (natural + artificial) was set at 15. 5 h. Light intensities and the corresponding temperature increases were measured at crop level. Between 15 and 85 -mu-mol/(m 2. s), 8 light intensity classes were distinguished; the control plot received only natural light. During the growing period, the plant heights were measured at regular intervals, showing no particular discrepancies among the various classes. The effect of applying light supplements was most evident between the 3 rd and 6 th week after planting. Both plant length and leaf colouring were evaluated when the plants were transferred to pots. Differences between classes could primarily be attributed to differences in intensity of the light supplement received; the effect of the temperature increases (< 1. 5 K) on either parameter was negligible. Plant height and the percentage of red coloured leaves were shown to be exponentially related to light intensity class. Potted Cordyline is valorized according to overall plant height. Calculated financial gain as compared to control was also exponentially related to light intensity class. The costs of providing a light supplement, i. e. luminaire and lamp cost and consumption of electricity, increase almost linearly with increasing light intensity. When electricity consumption is charged according to the special advantageous high tension rates as provided by the public supplier, and taking into account a total day length of 16 h, lighting costs exceed the financial gains from 45 -mu-mol/(m 2. s) (+/- 3200 lx for high pressure sodium lamps) onwards. The optimum light supplement intensity, this is the intensity with which to achieve maximum financial benefit, was situated at 20 -mu-mol/(m 2. s) (+/- 1430 lx). However, since the minimum intensity at which sufficient uniformity can be guaranteed with the current <b>luminaire</b> <b>types,</b> is about 25 -mu-mol/(m 2. s) (+/- 1800 lx), the latter value is put forward as the optimum.
