5|$|August 29, 1775– The Mid-Atlantic States {{are first}} {{impacted}} by the Independence Hurricane, which crosses the eastern portion {{of the state in}} early September. The hurricane destroys all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corn</b> crop in the northeastern portion of the state, and kills 163people in the state. In the aftermath of the hurricane, the Second Continental Congress provide farmers in the northeastern portion of the state with 40shillings to purchase corn and other supplies.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the Philippines, damage {{amounted}} to roughly 1.21billion PHP (US$31million), of which 664million PHP (US$17million) {{was attributed to}} agriculture. Approximately eightpercent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corn</b> and rice harvest was destroyed. A total of 2,605homes were destroyed while another 18,181were damaged. Across seven provinces, 364,733people were affected by the typhoon, 65,585of whom were significantly impacted. A total of 34people lost their lives {{as a result of}} Cimaron. Additionally, 65people sustained injuries.|$|E

30|$|Johnson’s {{method has}} at least three drawbacks: (i) it is mainly an {{exploratory}} research, which needs to be reinterpreted; (ii) <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Corning</b> Phillips as a reference generates discrepancies due to the highly heterogeneous nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> manuscript, produced by <b>the</b> overlap <b>of</b> chronologically different texts, and (iii) {{the one and only}} transcription <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Corning</b> manuscript is considered obsolete.|$|R

5|$|Across Honduras, {{agriculture}} sustained serious damage, with initial {{estimates of}} 70% of crops destroyed. Flooding affected about 29% of the country's arable land, much of covered {{for an extended}} period of time. This washed away large areas of topsoil, which would take a long period of time to recover. About 85% of the banana crop was lost, along with the loss of 60% of melons, 60% of sugar cane, and 58% of corn. About one-third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corn</b> crop had already been harvested. About 50,000bovine were killed, as were 60% of the fowl population. Crop and agricultural damage totaled about $1billion, which would take the country years to recover. Poor road conditions following the storm prevented crops from being dried, which caused further damage.|$|E
5|$|Garrow {{also became}} {{involved}} in the repeal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Corn</b> Laws, voting for the measure, and sponsored legislation to control surgical practice in the United Kingdom; the bill did not, however, pass into law. In the early 19th century animal cruelty was widespread; Garrow {{was one of those who}} found it appalling, and sponsored a bill in 1816 to increase the penalties for riding horses until their severe injury or death. While defeated, his actions were vindicated by a bill of 1820 introduced by Thomas Erskine, which was given the Royal Assent and came into law. Garrow eventually resigned as Attorney General and as a member of parliament in 1817, when he was appointed one of the Barons of the Exchequer.|$|E
5|$|Helicoverpa zea earns its {{nickname}} {{the corn}} earworm for its widely known destruction of cornfields. The corn earworm feeds on {{every part of}} corn, including the kernels. Severe feeding {{at the tip of}} kernels allows entry for diseases and mold growth. Larvae begin feeding on the kernels once they have reached third instar. Larvae penetrate 9 to 15cm into the ear, with deeper penetration occurring as the kernels harden. Larvae do not eat the hard kernels, but take bites out of many kernels, lowering the quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corn</b> for processing.|$|E

He also knew of the Pilgrims' theft <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corn</b> stores in their landings at Provincetown. Squanto had been abducted in 1614 by English explorer Thomas Hunt and had spent five years in Europe, first as a slave for a group of Spanish monks, then in England. He had returned to New England in 1619, acting as a guide to explorer Capt. Robert Gorges. Massasoit and his men had massacred the crew of the ship and had taken in Squanto.|$|E
5|$|Northern England, as {{the first}} area {{in the world to}} industrialise, was the birthplace of much modern {{political}} thought. Reports into the lives of the Northern working class, from Friedrich Engels' The Condition of the Working Class in England to George Orwell's The Road to Wigan Pier, shaped Marxism and, more generally, socialism. Meanwhile, enterprise and trade at the North's ports influenced the birth of Manchester Liberalism, a laissez-faire free trade philosophy. Expounded by C. P. Scott and the Manchester Guardian, the movement's greatest success was the repeal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Corn</b> Laws, protests against which had led to the 1819 Peterloo Massacre in Manchester.|$|E
5|$|On August12, Betsy struck southeastern Puerto Rico {{and quickly}} crossed the island. Damage was {{heaviest}} where it moved ashore {{and in the}} territory's central portion, and throughout Puerto Rico there were 15,023houses that were destroyed by Betsy. Multiple locations reported heavy crop damage, including Camuy which reported a complete loss <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corn</b> crop. Hurricane Betsy was the first hurricane to be observed from the San Juan radar, and also resulted in the first hurricane warning on the island to be released on television. The hurricane left $40million in damage and 16deaths, which prompted a federally declared disaster area. Locally the hurricane {{was known as the}} Santa Clara Hurricane. After exiting Puerto Rico, Betsy brushed the Bahamas before turning northeastward, becoming extratropical on August18. The remnants dissipated two days later to the south of Newfoundland.|$|E

40|$|Different corn hybrids and soybean cultivars {{were tested}} for their {{allelopathic}} effects on <b>the</b> subsequent <b>corn</b> yield. Three planting dates were imposed on a mid-season hybrid or cultivar {{so that the}} developmental stage effect of corn or soybean could be evaluated. <b>The</b> residues <b>of</b> <b>corn</b> and soybean were either removed or incorporated into the soil. On <b>the</b> average, <b>corn</b> and soybean did not significantly affect <b>the</b> subsequent <b>corn</b> yield. <b>The</b> difference between yields of corn in a continuous corn and corn following soybean was mainly due to the inhibitory allelopathic effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous <b>corn.</b> Maturity type and hybrid of corn, associated with plant size, were the prime factors affecting <b>the</b> subsequent <b>corn</b> yield. Late corn hybrid and mid-season corn hybrid planted on May 15 strongly depressed grain yield <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subsequent <b>corn.</b> For <b>the</b> mid-season <b>corn</b> hybrid, <b>the</b> more progress <b>the</b> developmental stage <b>of</b> <b>corn</b> toward maturity, <b>the</b> stronger the inhibitory effect. Soybean cultivars did not affect <b>the</b> subsequent <b>corn</b> yield. Nevertheless, {{there was a slight}} increase in grain yield <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subsequent <b>corn</b> caused by soybean;When the data were compared to 100 % for oat control plots, the results indicate that <b>the</b> late <b>corn</b> hybrid obviously reduced <b>the</b> subsequent <b>corn</b> yield and all soybean cultivars increased grain yield <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subsequent <b>corn.</b> Either <b>the</b> <b>corn</b> residue removed or incorporated affected <b>the</b> subsequent <b>corn</b> yield similar to oat. For soybean, either the residue was removed or incorporated, grain yield <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subsequent <b>corn</b> was increased, as compared to oat control plots;Using the Lemna bioassay to detect the allelochemicals in <b>the</b> extracts <b>of</b> soil from <b>the</b> previous <b>corn</b> and soybean plots was unsuccessful. The results from the two years studied were sometimes contradictory. In general the highest extract concentration from both corn and soybean was inhibitory to Lemna growth;A study was conducted to determine if intercropping soybean into <b>corn</b> increased <b>the</b> grain yield <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subsequent <b>corn</b> by means of stimulatory allelochemicals. Three soybean cultivars with three corn to soybean ratios were used. Intercropping did not affect <b>the</b> grain yield <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subsequent <b>corn.</b> Evidence from <b>the</b> study suggests that certain management practices may be recognized and employed to increase yield <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second year <b>corn...</b>|$|R
5|$|Peel {{successfully}} {{steered the}} repeal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Corn</b> Laws through Parliament, and was then defeated by {{an alliance of}} all his enemies {{on the issue of}} Irish law and order; he resigned in June 1846. The Tories remained split and the Queen sent for Lord John Russell, the Whig leader. In the 1847 general election, Disraeli stood, successfully, for the Buckinghamshire constituency. The new House of Commons had more Conservative than Whig members, but the depth of the Tory schism enabled Russell to continue to govern. The Conservatives were led by Bentinck in the Commons and Stanley in the Lords.|$|E
5|$|Predators <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corn</b> crake on its European {{breeding}} grounds include feral and domestic cats, introduced American mink, feral ferrets, otters and red foxes, and birds including the common buzzard and hooded crow. In Lithuania, the introduced raccoon dog {{has also been}} recorded taking corn crakes. When chicks are exposed by rapid mowing, they may be taken by large birds including the white stork, harriers and other birds of prey, gulls and corvids. At undisturbed sites, nests and broods are rarely attacked, which {{is reflected in the}} high breeding success.|$|E
5|$|The President of the Board of Trade, William Gladstone, {{resigned}} from the cabinet over the Maynooth Grant. The Corn Laws imposed a tariff on imported wheat, protecting British farmers from foreign competition, but making the cost of bread artificially high. Peel hoped that the repeal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Corn</b> Laws and the resultant influx of cheaper wheat into Britain would relieve {{the condition of the}} poor, and in particular the suffering caused by successive failure of potato crops in Ireland—the Great Famine.|$|E
30|$|The third meaning, {{which was}} preceded by a growing {{awareness}} that <b>the</b> contents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Corning</b> manuscript were heterogeneous, was initiated by Halleux and Meyvaert’s work [20]. Halleux and Meyvaert identified Mappæ Clavicula as only one part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Corning</b> manuscript; that is, solely the alchemical nucleus translated from Greek into Latin, which has also been copied in a few other codices (Sélestat, Bibliothèque Humaniste 17 and Glasgow, University Library, Hunterian 110). The critical edition by Baroni et al. [29] took for granted the new meaning ascribed to the title Mappæ Clavicula: the authors increased <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> witnesses of this tradition, without giving its inventory 5 (for an updated review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> studies on Mappæ Clavicula, see [30]).|$|R

5|$|The coffeehouse {{became a}} popular place to debate ideas, with growing {{literacy}} {{and the development}} of the printing press making news widely available; and Fleet Street became the centre of the British press. Following the invasion of Amsterdam by Napoleonic armies, many financiers relocated to London, especially a large Jewish community, and the first London international issue was arranged in 1817. Around the same time, the Royal Navy became the world leading war fleet, acting as a serious deterrent to potential economic adversaries of the United Kingdom. The repeal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Corn</b> Laws in 1846 was specifically aimed at weakening Dutch economic power. London then overtook Amsterdam as the leading international financial centre.|$|E
5|$|The {{end of the}} Napoleonic Wars in 1815 had {{resulted}} in periods of famine and chronic unemployment, exacerbated {{by the introduction of}} the first <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Corn</b> Laws. By the beginning of 1819, the pressure generated by poor economic conditions, coupled with the relative lack of suffrage in Northern England, had enhanced the appeal of political radicalism. In response, the Manchester Patriotic Union, a group agitating for parliamentary reform, organised a demonstration to be addressed by the well-known radical orator Henry Hunt.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the powers exercised by the lieutenant governor are statutory and have been assigned by the Indiana General Assembly. The first additional powers granted to the lieutenant governor were added in 1932 when the office holder was made {{the head of the}} state's agricultural commission. The office's powers have since expanded to include the chairmanship of the Office of Community and Rural Affairs, the Indiana Housing and Community Development Authority, Office of Energy and Defense Development, and the Office of Tourism Development. As head of the various office and committees, the lieutenant governor controls many patronage positions and is permitted to fill them by appointment. Important positions filled by the lieutenant governor include the members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Corn</b> Marketing Council, the Main Street Council, Steel Advisory Commission, and the Indiana Film Commission.|$|E

5|$|The rails are a bird family {{comprising}} nearly 150 species. Although {{origins of}} the group are lost in antiquity, {{the largest number of}} species and least specialised forms are found in the Old World, suggesting this family originated there. The taxonomy of the small crakes is complicated, but the closest relative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corn</b> crake is the African crake, C. egregia, which has sometimes been given its own genus, Crecopsis, but is now more usually placed in Crex. Both species are short-billed brown birds with a preference for grassland rather than wetland habitats typical of rails. Porzana crakes, particularly the ash-throated crake (Porzana albicollis) are near relatives of the Crex genus.|$|E
5|$|The {{taxonomy}} {{of the small}} crakes is complicated, but the closest relative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corn</b> crake is the African crake, C. egregia. This was first described as Ortygometra egregria by Wilhelm Peters in 1854 from a specimen obtained in Mozambique, and has variously been placed in the genus Porzana or its own genus, Crecopsis, but is now more usually placed in Crex. The Porzana crakes are the closest relatives of the Crex genus, particularly the ash-throated crake, Porzana albicollis, which has occasionally also been allocated to Crex.|$|E
5|$|Various causes {{contributed to}} this decline. The {{abolition}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Corn</b> Laws in 1846 allowed the free importation of grain into these islands. Unable to compete with foreigners, the Irish farmer turned his land to pasture and grew only sufficient grain for his own use. The Banagher corn trade rapidly declined, and would have completely vanished were it not that barley growing was kept alive by Waller's malthouse. The clearances in East Galway {{in the years immediately}} succeeding the Great Irish Famine adversely affected the trade of the town while the smaller industries were unable to compete against the highly organised industries of Britain.|$|E
30|$|The second meaning {{was inaugurated}} by <b>the</b> {{research}} <b>of</b> Rozelle Parker Johnson on <b>the</b> tradition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Corning</b> manuscript, {{which was published}} in 1935 – 1937. According to Johnson, the title ‘Mappæ Clavicula’ denoted all <b>the</b> texts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Corning</b> manuscript, including <b>the</b> contents <b>of</b> Lucca 490, and referred to about 80 witnesses [22 – 24]. Johnson’s concept of a unique collection including the Lucca 490 manuscript is shared by Bernhard Bischoff, an illustrious medieval historian and palaeographer. According to Bischoff, the five best-known medieval recipe books (Lucca 490, Sélestat 17, Corning, Madrid 19, and the Klosterneuburg fragment) have a common source that he refers to as Mappæ Clavicula, because they include similar contents ([25], pp. 277 – 80). This notion was still predominant in the early 2000 s: Tosatti [26], pp. 27 – 36, Kroustallis [27], pp. 69 – 70, Clarke [28], pp. 23 – 26, Pomaro [14], p. 171.|$|R
50|$|Astronomers {{using the}} Hale Telescope have {{discovered}} distant objects at <b>the</b> edges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> known universe called quasars and {{have given us}} the first direct evidence of stars in distant galaxies.

A one-tenth-scale engineering model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> telescope at <b>Corning</b> Community College in Corning, New York, home <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Corning</b> Glass Works (now Corning Incorporated) was used to discover at least one minor planet, (34419) Corning.|$|R
30|$|Between the two World Wars, {{research}} into medieval ‘art’/craft recipe books occurred {{not only through}} the discovery and publication of medieval manuscripts, but also through in-depth analysis that took place along two main lines. On one hand, Daniel Varney Thompson Jr. addressed <b>the</b> study <b>of</b> medieval craftsmanship in his seminal 1935 paper [40], by examining 158 manuscripts between the tenth and fifteenth centuries held in 18 libraries. <b>The</b> product <b>of</b> his work is a source-book of medieval ‘arts’/crafts, which includes 202 subjects and sub-subjects ordered alphabetically from absinthium to yellow lead. On the other hand, and most relevant for the present paper, in the 1930 s Johnson explored <b>the</b> witnesses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Corning</b> manuscript scattered over 25 European libraries. He used all <b>the</b> text units <b>of</b> its 1847 first transcription as a   reference [10], and compared them with the alleged witnesses. In so doing, he discovered 81 witnesses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Corning,</b> some <b>of</b> which contain large sections, and others just short excerpts [22 – 24].|$|R
