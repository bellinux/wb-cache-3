Lough Foyle on the <b>other</b> <b>side,</b> <b>is</b> one of Ireland's larger inlets, situated between County Donegal and County Londonderry. Further round the coast is Belfast Lough, between County Antrim and County Down. Also in County Down is Strangford Lough, actually an inlet partially separating the Ards peninsula from the mainland. Further down the coast, Carlingford Lough is situated between Down and County Louth.|$|E
5|$|On the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>is</b> her uncle, King Leopold I of the Belgians, {{who wishes}} to use his {{influence}} through family ties to secure an alliance between Britain and his kingdom. He decides to have his nephew Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha seduce Victoria and he is coached in her likes and dislikes. The Duchess invites the Coburg brothers, Albert and Prince Ernest of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, to visit the household. Victoria and Albert develop an early fondness for each other, despite Victoria knowing that Albert was sent by their uncle to win her favours. They begin writing to one another after Albert returns home.|$|E
5|$|The top tower {{along the}} front wall of the forward compound, tower 6, has a square base which was {{reinforced}} with a six-sided foundation. Working west, the square base of tower 7 was reinforced with a circular foundation. Tower 8, on the upper side of the front portcullis, has an irregular, but generally square, base. It is also the shortest of the first nine towers. Guarding the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>is</b> tower 9, which has a square base reinforced by an eight-sided foundation.|$|E

25|$|Another way of {{thinking}} about it is that the problem is not about the chance that the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>is</b> black, it's about the chance that you drew the all black card. If you drew a black face, then it's twice as likely that that face belongs to the black card than the mixed card.|$|E

25|$|Billon coins - There {{are around}} one hundred {{preserved}} coins of that type. On {{one side is}} the image of the Emperor and Saint Demetrius upright and holding a scepter with a star.

25|$|The cipher on {{one side}} of Antipodes repeats the text from Kryptos. Much of the cipher on Antipodes <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>is</b> {{duplicated}} on Cyrillic Projector. The Russian portion of the cipher found on Cyrillic Projector and Antipodes was solved in 2003 by Frank Corr and Mike Bales independently from each other with translation from Russian plaintext provided by Elonka Dunin.|$|E
25|$|Active {{listening}} â€“ Listening is {{more than}} just hearing what the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>is</b> saying. Active listening involves paying close attention to what is being said verbally and nonverbally. It involves periodically seeking further clarification from the person. By asking the person exactly what they mean, they may realize you are not simply walking through a routine, but rather take them seriously.|$|E

25|$|During chewing, the {{mandible}} {{moves in}} a specific manner as delineated by the two temporomandibular joints. The side of the mandible that moves laterally {{is referred to as}} either the working or rotating side, while the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>is</b> referred to as either the balancing or orbiting side. The latter terms, although a bit outdated, are actually more precise, as they define the sides by the movements of the respective condyles.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, {{the crystal}} {{structure}} of PEDF was successfully generated. The PEDF structure includes 3 beta sheets and 10 alpha helices. This discovery demonstrated that PEDF has an asymmetrical charge distribution {{across the whole}} protein. One side of the protein is heavily basic and the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>is</b> heavily acidic, leading to a polar 3-D structure. They proposed that the basic side of the protein contains a heparin binding site.|$|E
25|$|To {{the west}} of Mellbreak is the marshy valley of Mosedale, its beck flowing north to Loweswater village. On the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>is</b> the {{parallel}} ridge of Hen Comb. The northern end of Mellbreak rises direct from the valley behind the village, precipitous like a sand castle on a flat beach. From this vantage point its steep gabled profile is an arresting sight. The successive rock tiers of White, Dropping and Raven Crags complete the picture.|$|E

25|$|In both cases, work {{is moved}} to compile-time. The {{difference}} between C macros on one side, and Lisp-like macros and C++ template metaprogramming on the <b>other</b> <b>side,</b> <b>is</b> {{that the latter}} tools allow performing arbitrary computations at compile-time/parse-time, while expansion of C macros does not perform any computation, and relies on the optimizer ability to perform it. Additionally, C macros do not directly support recursion or iteration, so are not Turing complete.|$|E
25|$|If an {{infinite}} graph G has a normal spanning tree, so does every connected graph minor of G. It follows from this that the graphs that have normal spanning trees have a characterization by forbidden minors. One {{of the two}} classes of forbidden minors consists of bipartite graphs in which {{one side of the}} bipartition is countable, the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>is</b> uncountable, and every vertex has infinite degree. The other class of forbidden minors consists of certain graphs derived from Aronszajn trees.|$|E
25|$|President of Ireland, Sean T. O'Kelly {{unveiled}} a memorial at Rath Cross Roads, Ashbourne,on Easter Sunday, 26 April 1959 which commemorates the Battle of Ashbourne. The story was covered {{on the front}} page of the Irish Times the next day. The memorial designed by Con O'Reilly and Peter Grant commemorates the Battle and John Crenigan and Thomas Rafferty who were killed. The monument has two images on one side the figure is in the form of Christ on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>is</b> a rebel. This monument is known locally as The Rath Cross.|$|E

25|$|The Maybach {{system is}} {{essentially}} a simplified version of the double differential, or more accurately in mechanical terms, a double controlled differential. It replaces the double differential's forward and reverse steering shaft and clutch system with a single shaft that spins in one direction, and brakes on the idlers. Like the controlled differential, the brakes are normally applied to keep the idlers fixed. The steering inputs release {{one or the other}} brake to cause the idler to spin and that track to slow. Unlike the full double differential, the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>is</b> not sped up so the system is not fully regenerative, and since both idler sets spin in the same direction, it does not offer neutral steering.|$|E
25|$|The word Estambol has widened {{in meaning}} to include {{exclusively}} the entire European side of Istanbul. The Asian side {{is usually not}} considered as Estambol, however the expression la civdad de Estambol would encompass {{the boundaries of the}} present-day city. There are few expression denoting the Asian side. Anatol, from Anatolia and Asya, meaning Asia are common words to denote the Asian side of Istanbul. Moreover, el otro lado (literally the <b>other</b> <b>side)</b> <b>is</b> a quite simplistic and descriptory expression for the Asian side of Istanbul, especially for those living in the European side. Those living in the Asian side however do not use this expression to denote the European side, but simply call it Estambol. The inhabitants are called EstambulÃ­ or EstambullÃ­.|$|E
25|$|Prior to each commencement, the ASU Alumni Association hosts a ring {{ceremony}} {{where the}} university president presents class rings to recipients. Appearing at each ceremony is ASU's mascot, Dominic. After receiving their rings, recipients touch their rings to Dominic's horns for strength, or rub them through his wool for luck. Though Angelo State rings have existed {{since the beginning}} of the university, a new official ASU ring was introduced by the ASU Alumni Society in 2003. The top of the Angelo State class ring presents the ASU seal. One side of the ring shows the State of Texas with a star marking San Angelo; below that is an oak branch. On the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>is</b> an image of the mascot, Dominic.|$|E
