25|$|HBO {{pioneered the}} free preview concept – {{which has since}} become a {{standard}} in the pay television industry – in 1973, {{as part of a}} plan to increase subscribership of the channel. Cable providers were originally granted permission to carry HBO on a local origination channel in order for those who are not subscribers the ability to view the channel for a limited number of days; with the advent of digital cable and satellite, providers now unencrypt the designated slots of each HBO channel during preview periods. Until the mid-1990s, on-air promotions featured between programs were replaced (and later, merely interspersed) with interstitials featuring on-air hosts asking viewers to subscribe to the service. Although participation was voluntary, preview events are carried by most major and some smaller pay television providers (the number <b>of</b> <b>providers</b> and the providers that choose to offer the event varies depending on the given free preview period, and may not be carried on all systems owned by a multiple system operator unless at the provider's discretion); HBO currently offers between three and five preview events each year to participating providers (which are normally scheduled to coincide with the premiere of a new or returning original series, and in the past, a high-profile special or feature film).|$|E

[...] "Non-scientific health care practitioners, including naturopaths, use unscientific methods and deception on a public who, lacking in-depth health care knowledge, must rely upon the assurance <b>of</b> <b>providers.</b> Quackery not only harms people, it undermines the ability to conduct scientific research and should be opposed by scientists", says William T.

Other types of DTC tests require customers to mail in DNA samples for testing; {{it is difficult for}} the FDA to exercise jurisdiction over these types of tests, because the actual testing is completed in the laboratories <b>of</b> <b>providers.</b> As of 2007, the FDA had not yet officially substantiated with scientific evidence the claimed accuracy of the majority of direct-to-consumer genetic tests.|$|E

("traditional" [...] in quotes {{because it is}} not the same as Original Medicare; {{everyone}} in Medicare must begin by joining Original Medicare; the term [...] "traditional" [...] typically refers to FFS and almost always means the beneficiary has a private group or individually purchased supplement to Original Medicare). Most research suggests that enrollees in Medicare HMOs tend to receive more preventative services than beneficiaries in traditional Medicare; however, beneficiaries, especially those in poorer health, tend to rate the quality and access to care in traditional Medicare more favorably than in Medicare Advantage. It is difficult to generalize the results of studies across all plans participating in the program because performance on quality and access metrics varies widely across the types of Medicare Advantage plans and among the dozens <b>of</b> <b>providers</b> of Medicare Advantage plans.|$|E

2500|$|Original [...] "fee-for-service" [...] Medicare Parts A and B have a {{standard}} benefit package that covers medically necessary care {{as described in}} the sections above that members can receive from nearly any hospital or doctor in the country (if that doctor or hospital accepts Medicare). Original Medicare beneficiaries who choose to enroll in a Part C Medicare Advantage health plan instead give up none of their rights as an Original Medicare beneficiary, receive the same standard benefits—as a minimum—as provided in Original Medicare, and get an annual out of pocket (OOP) upper spending limit not included in Original Medicare. However they must typically use only a select network <b>of</b> <b>providers</b> except in emergencies, typically restricted to the area surrounding their legal residence (which can vary from tens to over 100 miles depending on county). Most Part C plans are traditional health maintenance organizations (HMOs) that require the patient to have a primary care physician, though a few are preferred provider organizations (which typically means the provider restrictions are not as confining as with an HMO).|$|E
2500|$|Just as {{the more}} loosely managed PPOs have edged out HMOs, HMOs {{themselves}} have also evolved towards less tightly managed models. The first HMOs in the U.S., such as Kaiser Permanente in Oakland, California, and the Health Insurance Plan (HIP) in New York, were [...] "staff-model" [...] HMOs, which owned their own health care facilities and employed the doctors {{and other health care}} professionals who staffed them. The name health maintenance organization stems from the idea that the HMO would make it its job to maintain the enrollee's health, rather than merely to treat illnesses. In accordance with this mission, managed care organizations typically cover preventive health care. Within the tightly integrated staff-model HMO, the HMO can develop and disseminate guidelines on cost-effective care, while the enrollee's primary care doctor can act as patient advocate and care coordinator, helping the patient negotiate the complex health care system. Despite a substantial body of research demonstrating that many staff-model HMOs deliver high-quality and cost-effective care, they have steadily lost market share. They have been replaced by more loosely managed networks <b>of</b> <b>providers</b> with whom health plans have negotiated discounted fees. It is common today for a physician or hospital to have contracts with a dozen or more health plans, each with different referral networks, contracts with different diagnostic facilities, and different practice guidelines.|$|E
