5|$|Six {{nonmetals}} occur naturally as monatomic noble gases: helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), and {{the radioactive}} radon (Rn). They comprise {{a group of}} chemical elements with very similar properties. In their standard states they are all colorless, <b>odourless,</b> nonflammable gases with characteristically very low chemical reactivity.|$|E
5|$|In adults, the {{diagnosis}} {{is supported by the}} absence of classical or structural diseases of the gastrointestinal system. Supportive criteria include a regurgitant that does not taste sour or acidic, is generally <b>odourless,</b> is effortless, or at most preceded by a belching sensation, that there is no retching preceding the regurgitation, and that the act is not associated with nausea or heartburn.|$|E
5|$|By 2007, Songpol Somsri, a Thai {{government}} scientist, had crossbred {{more than}} ninety varieties of durian to create Chantaburi No.1, a cultivar without the characteristic odour. Another hybrid, Chantaburi No. 3, develops the odour {{about three days}} after the fruit is picked, which enables an <b>odourless</b> transport yet satisfies consumers who prefer the pungent odour. On 22 May 2012, two other cultivars from Thailand that also lack the usual odour, Long Laplae and Lin Laplae, were presented to the public by Yothin Samutkhiri, governor of Uttaradit Province from where these cultivars were developed locally, while he announced the dates for the yearly durian fair of Laplae District, and the name giver to both cultivars.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the great}} {{reactivity}} of atomic nitrogen, elemental nitrogen usually occurs as molecular N2, dinitrogen. This molecule is a colourless, <b>odourless,</b> and tasteless diamagnetic gas at standard conditions: it melts at −210°C and boils at −196°C. Dinitrogen is mostly unreactive at room temperature, {{but it will}} nevertheless react with lithium metal and some transition metal complexes. This is due to its bonding, which is unique among the diatomic elements at standard conditions in that it has an N≡N triple bond. Triple bonds have short bond lengths (in this case, 109.76pm) and high dissociation energies (in this case, 945.41kJ/mol), and are thus very strong, explaining dinitrogen's chemical inertness.|$|E
5|$|Thorium is <b>odourless</b> and tasteless. The {{chemical}} {{toxicity of}} thorium is low because thorium and its most common compounds (mostly the dioxide) are poorly soluble in water, precipitating out {{before entering the}} body as the hydroxide. Some thorium compounds are chemically moderately toxic, especially {{in the presence of}} strong complex-forming ions such as citrate that carry the thorium into the body in soluble form. If thorium is ingested, 0.4% of it and 90% of its dangerous daughters are leached into the body. Out of the thorium that does remain in the body, three quarters of it accumulates in the skeleton. Absorption through the skin is possible, but is not a likely means of exposure. Thorium's low solubility in water also means that excretion of thorium by the kidneys and faeces is rather slow.|$|E
25|$|All alkanes are {{colourless}} and <b>odourless.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ammonia may be {{conveniently}} deodorized by reacting it {{with either}} sodium bicarbonate or acetic acid. Both of these reactions form an <b>odourless</b> ammonium salt.|$|E
25|$|Starch or amylum is a {{polysaccharide}} {{produced by}} all green plants as an energy store. Pure starch is a white, tasteless and <b>odourless</b> powder. It {{consists of two}} types of molecules: the linear and helical amylose and the branched amylopectin. Depending on the plant, starch generally contains 20 to 25% amylose and 75 to 80% amylopectin by weight.|$|E
25|$|Berthelot {{was able}} to prepare this gas by passing vapours of organic {{compounds}} (methanol, ethanol, etc.) through a red-hot tube and collecting the effluent. He also found acetylene was formed by sparking electricity through mixed cyanogen and hydrogen gases. Berthelot later obtained acetylene directly by passing hydrogen between the poles of a carbon arc. Commercially available acetylene gas could smell foul due to the common impurities hydrogen sulfide and phosphine. However, as purity increases it becomes <b>odourless.</b>|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} acutely toxic indoor air {{contaminants}} is carbon monoxide (CO), a colourless, <b>odourless</b> gas that is a byproduct of incomplete combustion of fossil fuels. Common sources of carbon monoxide are tobacco smoke, space heaters using fossil fuels, defective central heating furnaces and automobile exhaust. By depriving the brain of oxygen, high levels of carbon monoxide can lead to nausea, unconsciousness and death. According to the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), the time-weighted average (TWA) limit for carbon monoxide (630-08-0) is 25 ppm.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} source of phosphoric acid is an 85% aqueous solution; such {{solutions}} are colourless, <b>odourless,</b> and non-volatile. The 85% solution is a syrupy liquid, but still pourable. Although phosphoric acid {{does not meet}} the strict definition of a strong acid, the 85% solution is acidic enough to be corrosive. Because of the high percentage of phosphoric acid in this reagent, {{at least some of the}} orthophosphoric acid is condensed into polyphosphoric acids; for the sake of labeling and simplicity, the 85% represents H3PO4 as if it were all in the ortho form. Dilute aqueous solutions of phosphoric acid exist in the ortho form.|$|E
25|$|It is {{difficult}} to detect most gases {{that are likely to}} be present in diving cylinders because they are colourless, <b>odourless</b> and tasteless. Electronic sensors exist for some gases, such as oxygen analysers, helium analyser, carbon monoxide detectors and carbon dioxide detectors. Oxygen analysers are commonly found underwater in rebreathers. Oxygen and helium analysers are often used on the surface during gas blending to determine the percentage of oxygen or helium in a breathing gas mix. Chemical and other types of gas detection methods are not often used in recreational diving, but are used for periodical quality testing of compressed breathing air from diving air compressors.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{attempts}} at quality control and standardisation, an extensive history of saffron adulteration, {{particularly among the}} cheapest grades, continues into modern times. Adulteration was first documented in Europe's Middle Ages, when those found selling adulterated saffron were executed under the Safranschou code. Typical methods include mixing in extraneous substances like beetroot, pomegranate fibres, red-dyed silk fibres, or the saffron crocus's tasteless and <b>odourless</b> yellow stamens. Other methods included dousing saffron fibres with viscid substances like honey or vegetable oil to increase their weight. Powdered saffron is more prone to adulteration, with turmeric, paprika, and other powders used as diluting fillers. Adulteration can also consist of selling mislabelled mixes of different saffron grades. Thus, in India, high-grade Kashmiri saffron is often sold and mixed with cheaper Iranian imports; these mixes are then marketed as pure Kashmiri saffron, a development that has cost Kashmiri growers much of their income. Safflower is a common substitute sometimes sold as saffron. The spice is reportedly counterfeited with horse hair, corn silk, or shredded paper. Tartrazine or sunset yellow {{have been used to}} colour counterfeit powdered saffron.|$|E

500|$|Prevention {{remains a}} vital public health issue, {{requiring}} public {{education on the}} safe operation of appliances, heaters, fireplaces, and internal-combustion engines, as well as increased emphasis on the installation of carbon monoxide detectors. [...] Carbon monoxide is tasteless and <b>odourless,</b> and therefore can not be detected by visual cues or smell.|$|E
500|$|Five {{nitrogen}} fluorides are known. Nitrogen trifluoride (NF3, first {{prepared in}} 1928) is a colourless and <b>odourless</b> gas that is thermodynamically stable, and most readily {{produced by the}} electrolysis of molten ammonium fluoride dissolved in anhydrous hydrogen fluoride. Like carbon tetrafluoride, {{it is not at}} all reactive and is stable in water or dilute aqueous acids or alkalis. Only when heated does it act as a fluorinating agent, and it reacts with copper, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth on contact at high temperatures to give tetrafluorohydrazine (N2F4). The cations [...] and [...] are also known (the latter from reacting tetrafluorohydrazine with strong fluoride-acceptors such as arsenic pentafluoride), as is ONF3, which has aroused interest due to the short N–O distance implying partial double bonding and the highly polar and long N–F bond. Tetrafluorohydrazine, unlike hydrazine itself, can dissociate at room temperature and above to give the radical NF2•. Fluorine azide (FN3) is very explosive and thermally unstable. Dinitrogen difluoride (N2F2) exists as thermally interconvertible cis and trans isomers, and was first found as a product of the thermal decomposition of FN3.|$|E
500|$|In medicine, silver is {{incorporated}} into wound dressings {{and used as}} an antibiotic coating in medical devices. Wound dressings containing silver sulfadiazine or silver nanomaterials are used to treat external infections. Silver is also used in some medical applications, such as urinary catheters (where tentative evidence indicates it reduces catheter-related urinary tract infections) and in endotracheal breathing tubes (where evidence suggests it reduces ventilator-associated pneumonia). The silver ion is bioactive and in sufficient concentration readily kills bacteria in vitro. They interfere with enzymes in the bacteria that transport nutrients, form structures, synthesise cell walls, and bond with the bacteria's genetic material. Microbes cannot develop resistance to silver as they can to antibiotics, and hence silver and silver nanoparticles are used as an antimicrobial {{in a variety of}} industrial, healthcare, and domestic application: for example, infusing clothing with nanosilver particles thus allows them to stay <b>odourless</b> for longer. Silver compounds are taken up by the body like mercury compounds, but lack the toxicity of the latter. Silver and its alloys are used in cranial surgery to replace bone, and silver–tin–mercury amalgams are used in dentistry. [...] Silver diammine fluoride, the fluoride salt of a coordination complex with the formula F, is a topical medicament (drug) used to treat and prevent dental caries (cavities) and relieve dentinal hypersensitivity.|$|E
2500|$|Each camp-site has between {{eight and}} fifteen camping pads, a toilet, {{untreated}} rainwater tanks, camp benches and, except for Blanket Bay, a shelter. [...] The Clivus Multrum toilets are a self-contained, waterless, <b>odourless</b> continuous composting system. [...] They were sized above their capacity {{taking into account}} climatic factors. [...] Waste material and wood shavings compost in the tanks and the vent pipe to reduce odours. Recycled red gum posts were sought from demolished wharfs at Docklands, which are used as feature posts for the toilets and shelter.|$|E
2500|$|Composting toilets use {{bacteria}} to decompose human feces into useful, <b>odourless,</b> sanitary compost. The process is sanitary because soil bacteria eat the human pathogens {{as well as}} most of the mass of the waste. [...] Nevertheless, most health authorities forbid direct use of [...] "humanure" [...] for growing food. The risk is microbial and viral contamination. [...] In a dry composting toilet, the waste is evaporated or digested to gas (mostly carbon dioxide) and vented, so a toilet produces only a few pounds of compost every six months. [...] To control the odor, modern toilets use a small fan to keep the toilet under negative pressure, and exhaust the gasses to a vent pipe.|$|E
2500|$|Contact with Libya was {{restored}} {{in the aftermath}} of the 1981 Irish Hunger Strike, which was said to have impressed Gadaffi. In the 1980s, the IRA secured larger quantities of weapons and explosives from Gaddafi's Libya – enough to supply at least two infantry battalions. Four successful shipments of arms were made between 1985 and 1986, providing large quantities of modern weaponry, including heavy weaponry such as heavy machine guns, over 1,000 rifles, several hundred handguns, rocket-propelled grenades, flamethrowers, surface-to-air missiles, and Semtex – an <b>odourless</b> explosive, invisible to X-rays, and many times more powerful than fertiliser. According to British journalist Toby Harnden, from late 1986 to 2011, [...] "virtually every bomb constructed by the Provisional IRA" [...] and splinter groups such as the Real IRA, [...] "has contained Semtex from a Libyan shipment unloaded at an Irish pier in 1986." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Alexander Chaplin & Co. distilling {{apparatus}} {{was designed}} initially {{for use on}} board steam vessels where it could be supplied with steam from either the main boiler or a donkey boiler with cooling water circulation from a pump driven from the main engine or an auxiliary. The subsequent addition of a steam powered circulating pump integral with the apparatus meant it could then {{also be used as}} a standalone apparatus on any vessel equipped with an existing donkey (auxiliary) boiler, such as a sailing ship equipped with steam winches. The apparatus consisted of a coiled condensing pipe approximately [...] in length placed inside a cylindrical casing filled with constantly changed cooling water. The casing was cast iron and the coils were made of copper. The coils were supplied with steam either from the exhaust of the engine, or from a feed directly from the boiler. A circulating pump, either driven from the main engine on a steam ship, or integrated with the apparatus on a sailing ship, supplied a constant stream of cooling water flowing through the condenser. A covered brass cup with small adjustable holes around the circumference was fitted at {{the upper end of the}} steam coil. In operation, a steam jet drew air in from the circumferential openings in the cup and filled the coils with a mixture of air and steam, both cooling the steam and reducing its pressure. As it passed down the coil, the air/steam mixture was further cooled by the surrounding water, and condensed as water droplets on the walls of the coil. The aerated water would collect as a clear, bright and <b>odourless</b> liquid at a temperature of about [...] at the bottom of the coil, to be drawn off for use. The machine could supply approximately [...] of water per hour. [...] "The samples of water subjected to analysis were collected at different times directly from the Patent Apparatus on board ship... and the results of my experiments with the water distilled in Alexander Chaplin & Co.'s are conclusive in showing that is of excellent quality in every particular." ...|$|E

60|$|The Sou-Westerly spell--a {{matter of}} three days--had given way before radiant stillness; and merely {{to be alive}} was to feel emotion. At a little stream running beside the moor under the wild stone man, the riders stopped their horses, just to listen, and, inhale the day. The far sweet chorus of life was tuned to a most {{delicate}} rhythm; {{not one of those}} small mingled pipings of streams and the lazy air, of beasts, men; birds, and bees, jarred out too harshly through the garment of sound enwrapping the earth. It was noon--the still moment--but this hymn to the sun, after his too long absence, never for a moment ceased to be murmured. And the earth wore an under-robe of scent, delicious, very finely woven of the young fern sap, heather buds; larch-trees not yet <b>odourless,</b> gorse just going brown, drifted woodsmoke, and the breath of hawthorn. Above Earth's twin vestments of sound and scent, the blue enwrapping scarf of air, that wistful wide champaign, was spanned only by the wings of Freedom.|$|E
