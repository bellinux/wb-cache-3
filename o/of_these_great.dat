5|$|In 1880, Wallace {{published}} the book Island Life as {{a sequel to}} The Geographical Distribution of Animals. It surveyed the distribution of both animal and plant species on islands. Wallace classified islands into three different types. Oceanic islands, such as the Galapagos and Hawaiian Islands (then known as the Sandwich Islands) formed in mid-ocean and never part of any large continent. Such islands were characterised by a complete lack of terrestrial mammals and amphibians, and their inhabitants (with the exceptions of migratory birds and species introduced by human activity) were typically the result of accidental colonisation and subsequent evolution. He divided continental islands into two separate classes depending on whether they had recently {{been part of a}} continent (like Britain) or much less recently (like Madagascar) and discussed how that difference affected the flora and fauna. He talked about how isolation affected evolution and how that could result in the preservation of classes of animals, such as the lemurs of Madagascar that were remnants of once widespread continental faunas. He extensively discussed how changes of climate, particularly periods of increased glaciation, may have affected the distribution of flora and fauna on some islands, and the first portion of the book discusses possible causes <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>great</b> ice ages. Island Life was considered a very important work {{at the time of its}} publication. It was discussed extensively in scientific circles both in published reviews and in private correspondence.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} {{estimated}} {{to have had a}} maximum population in the millions. The great auk was hunted on a significant scale for food, eggs, and its down feathers from at least the eighth century. Prior to that, hunting by local natives may be documented from Late Stone Age Scandinavia and eastern North America, as well as from early fifth century Labrador, where the bird seems to have occurred only as stragglers. Early explorers, including Jacques Cartier, and numerous ships attempting to find gold on Baffin Island were not provisioned with food for the journey home, and therefore, used this vulnerable species as both a convenient food source and bait for fishing. Reportedly, some of the later vessels anchored next to a colony and ran out planks to the land. The sailors then herded hundreds <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>great</b> auks onto the ships, where they were slaughtered. Some authors have questioned the reports of this hunting method and whether it was successful. Great auk eggs were also a valued food source, as the eggs were {{three times the size of}} a murre's and had a large yolk. These sailors also introduced rats onto the islands, that preyed upon nests.|$|E

25|$|Another {{consideration}} was education. Before {{the late}} 1950s and {{the advent of}} the stately home business, very few working-class people had seen the upstairs <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>great</b> houses; those that had were there only to clean and serve, with an obligation to keep their eyes down, rather than uplift them and be educated. Thus ignorance of the nation's heritage was a large contributory factor to the indifference that met the destruction.|$|E
25|$|Some {{difficulties}} arose {{with the}} introduction of the first calendar reform, particularly the pushing forward of important Zoroastrian festivals such as Hamaspat-maedaya and Nowruz on the calendar year by year. This confusion apparently caused much distress among ordinary people, and while the Sassanids tried to enforce the observance <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>great</b> celebrations on the new official dates, much of the populace continued to observe them on the older, traditional dates, and so parallel celebrations for Nowruz and other Zoroastrian celebrations would often occur within days of each other, in defiance of the new official calendar dates, causing much confusion and friction between the laity and the ruling class. A compromise on this by the Sassanids was later introduced, by linking the parallel celebrations as a 6-day celebration/feast. This was done for all except Nowruz.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} reasons which had brought about this {{situation}} – most significantly in the early 20th century there was no firmly upheld legislation to protect what is now {{considered to be the}} nation's heritage. Additionally, public opinion did not have the sentiment and interest in national heritage that is evident in Britain today. When the loss of Britain's architectural heritage reached its height at the rate of one house every five days in 1955, few were particularly interested or bothered. In the immediate aftermath of World War II, to the British public still suffering from the deprivations of food rationing and restriction on building work the destruction <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>great</b> redundant houses was of little interest. From 1914 onwards there had been a huge exodus away from a life in domestic service; having experienced the less restricted and better paid life away from the great estates, few were anxious to return – this in itself was a further reason that life in the English country house was becoming near impossible to all but the very rich.|$|E

The worst cardinals, providing, of course, the material for the worst Popes, {{have been for the}} most part cardinal nephews, the temptation to the creation of such having been rendered too great to be resisted by the exorbitant greatness of the power, dignity, and wealth attributed {{to the members of the}} Sacred College.

500|$|Along with Raimi and Campbell, {{film critics}} were largely dismissive of the film. A writer for Time Out gave a {{negative}} review, writing [...] "despite its ambition and a Coen Brothers script credit, Raimi's second film {{was a disappointment}} after his astonishing debut The Evil Dead." [...] The writer did however compliment some of the set pieces featured in the film, ultimately commenting that only people interested in the early work by Raimi would be interested. Film Junk writer Sean Harley commented that the main appeal {{of the film is}} that it was directed and written by notable artists, insisting [...] "based on their impressive filmographies and the cult followings that both have amassed, a collaboration of this magnitude would be a cinematic event like no other." [...] However, he commented that the film was a disappointment, noting that fans of the films by Raimi could likely enjoy it. He summarized that the film was [...] "not a particularly brilliant movie, and it's easily one of the weakest projects that any <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>great</b> filmmakers have been involved in", giving it a weak recommendation.|$|E

2500|$|The Chen Yuan {{were among}} the {{northern}} aristocratic clans that retreated south as north China was overrun by the Xiongnu. According to the great 10th century genealogist Liu Fang: [...] "Across the Yangzi River, the elite clans were known as 'émigré clans'; the Wang (王), Xie (謝), Yuan, and Xiao (萧) [...] were the greatest among them." [...] When Sima Rui established an Eastern Jin regime at Jiankang in 317, he did so {{with the support of}} powerful members <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>great</b> families. The Chen Yuan brought with them dependants and armed retainers, and they were eventually able to carve out large estates for themselves in the peripheral frontier districts. One branch of the clan settled in Yichun, in east-central China. Eventually it grew to such size that the prefecture was renamed Yuanzhou (袁州) in the early 7th century.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{probable}} that the great vaults of the Assyrian palaces were constructed in the same way, but with unburnt bricks dried only in the sun: one of the drains discovered by Sir Austen Henry Layard at Nimrud was built as a pitched-brick vault. From the fact that each Assyrian monarch on his accession to the throne commenced his reign by the erection of a palace, it {{is probable}} that, owing to the ephemeral construction <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>great</b> vaults, half a century was the term of their existence. This may also account {{for the fact that}} no domed structures exist of the type shown in one of the bas-reliefs from Nimrud; the tradition of their [...] erection, however, would seem to have been handed down to their successors in Mesopotamia, viz. to the Sassanians, who in their palaces in Sarvestan and Firouzabad built domes of similar form to those shown in the Nimrud sculptures, the chief difference being that, constructed in rubble stone and cemented with mortar, they still exist, though probably abandoned on the Islamic invasion in the 7th century.|$|E

[...] The resultant achievement, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, in New York City, testifies not only to Wright's architectural genius, {{but also to the}} adventurous spirit that characterized its founders. [...] The critic Paul Goldberger later wrote that, before Wright's modernist building, [...] "there were only two common models for museum design: Beaux-arts Palace ... and the International Style Pavilion." [...] Goldberger thought the building a catalyst for change, making it [...] "socially and culturally acceptable for an architect to design a highly expressive, intensely personal museum. In this sense almost every museum of our time is a child of the Guggenheim." ...|$|E
