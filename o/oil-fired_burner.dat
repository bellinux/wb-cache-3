40|$|The dioxin {{contamination}} incident {{demonstrated that}} the food chain is only as secure as its weakest link and highlighted the consequences for the entire chain if something untoward happens with animal feed. To date it has cost the Irish taxpayer in excess of € 100 million from the financial assistance facility {{made available to the}} industry and not to mention the cost to industry of providing contingency supplies to their customers, the costs of lost busi ness, and the consequent damage to reputations. This review seeks to establish what factors contributed to this dioxin contamination incident and what policies, and practices, might be put in place to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. All of the evidence available suggests that the incident occurred as a result of contaminated fuel being used in an <b>oil-fired</b> <b>burner</b> (direct flame drying system) that generated the heat to dry the feed at Millstream Recycling Ltd., and a failure by th e Feed Business Operator (Millstream Recycling Ltd.,) to identify the potential hazards associated with the direct flame drier, and the risk of contaminating feed if inappropriate fuel was used, and to put the necessary control measures in place...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Oil-fired</b> <b>burners</b> are {{fitted with}} a safety {{mechanism}} for determining if the fuel has ignited and a flame present. The terms [...] "primary control", [...] "safety control", [...] "cad cell control", [...] "master control", and [...] "fire-eye control" [...] are variously used to describe a light dependent electrical resistor (LDR) which detects the flame whose value changes {{by the amount of}} light it is exposed to. The resistance decreases as the LDR is exposed to more light. The material is usually cadmium sulfide, hence the name [...] "cad cell" [...] for this component. In darkness the resistance is around 1 MΩ, while when exposed to light from a properly ignited flame the resistance is significantly lower, around 75-300 Ω.|$|R
5000|$|When a {{pressurized}} container {{such as the}} waterside of a steam boiler ruptures, it is always followed by some degree of steam explosion. A common operating temperature and pressure for a marine boiler is around 950 P.S.I. (6.55 MPa) and 850 °F (454 °C) at the outlet of the superheater. A steam boiler has an interface of steam and water in the steam drum, {{which is where the}} water is finally evaporating due to the heat input, usually <b>oil-fired</b> <b>burners.</b> When a water tube fails due to any of a variety of reasons, it causes the water in the boiler to expand out of the opening into the furnace area that is only a few P.S.I. above atmospheric pressure. This will likely extinguish all fires and expands over the large surface area {{on the sides of the}} boiler. To decrease the likelihood of a devastating explosion, boilers have gone from the [...] "fire-tube" [...] designs, where the heat was added by passing hot gases through tubes in a body of water, to [...] "water-tube" [...] boilers that have the water inside of the tubes and the furnace area is around the tubes. Old [...] "fire-tube" [...] boilers often failed due to poor build quality or lack of maintenance (such as corrosion of the fire tubes, or fatigue of the boiler shell due to constant expansion and contraction). A failure of fire tubes forces large volumes of high pressure, high temperature steam back down the fire tubes in a fraction of a second and often blows the burners off the front of the boiler, whereas a failure of the pressure vessel surrounding the water would lead to a full and entire evacuation of the boiler's contents in a large steam explosion. On a marine boiler, this would certainly destroy the ship's propulsion plant and possibly the corresponding end of the ship.|$|R
40|$|Once-through boilers {{are very}} {{sensitive}} to the combustion process in the steam generator combustion chamber. Fuel to feed water flow ratio should be maintained in a very narrow range in order to ensure proper functioning. This is especially true when the combustion system is complex consisting of a great number of burners. In this paper influence of a 16 <b>burner</b> <b>oil-fired</b> combustion system of a real steam generator on the temperature, velocity and heat flux distributions inside the combustion chamber was investigated. Simulations of the combustion chamber performance for normal operation and for the anomalous operation without a burner were carried out and related to the actual situations. It was shown that poor functioning of a single burner can cause distortion of the main parameter distributions which may result in the damage of the steam generator vital parts...|$|R
