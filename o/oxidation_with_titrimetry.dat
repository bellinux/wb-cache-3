Diatomite, a natural mineral, was used as catalyst in this study. The effect of O 3 dosage, salinity, initial cyanide concentration and initial pH condition were investigated.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the structural features responsible for the cytotoxicity of the naturally occurring lignan nordihydroguaiaretic acid, the synthesis of four structural analogues of NDGA is proposed {{for the purpose of}} studying their oxidative metabolism. One analogue in particular (1), a mono-catechol analogue, is successfully synthesized employing a double Stobbe condensation approach. Following synthesis of this compound a series of oxidation experiments is performed consisting of: incubation in rat liver microsomes with and without the trapping agent glutathione (GSH), <b>oxidation</b> <b>with</b> mushroom tyrosinase, <b>oxidation</b> <b>with</b> silver oxide, and <b>oxidation</b> <b>with</b> horseradish peroxidase. Results are analyzed via HPLC and UPLC-MS. It is found that 1 does not autoxidize at pH 7. 4 as NDGA does. Two products are produced during incubation of 1 in rat liver microsomes with UPLC-ESI(-) -MS results giving m/z of 879. 2 and 574. 18. This is consistent with 1 plus 2 GSH and 1 plus 1 GSH respectively; confirming 1 will oxidize to an electrophilic moiety. <b>Oxidation</b> <b>with</b> mushroom tyrosinase is found to produce high levels of product two with m/z 574. 2. <b>Oxidation</b> <b>with</b> horseradish peroxidase is found to produce high levels of the m/z 879. 2 product.

40|$|Factors {{controlling}} the anaerobic <b>oxidation</b> of ammonium <b>with</b> nitrate and nitrite were explored in a marine sediment from the Skagerrak in the Baltic-North Sea transition. In anoxic incubations {{with the addition}} of nitrite, approximately 65 % of the nitrogen gas formation was due to anaerobic ammonium <b>oxidation</b> <b>with</b> nitrite, with the remainder being produced by denitrification. Anaerobic ammonium <b>oxidation</b> <b>with</b> nitrite exhibited a biological temperature response, with a rate optimum at 15 °C and a maximum temperature of 37 °C. The biological nature of the process and a 1 : 1 stoichiometry for the reaction between nitrite and ammonium indicated that the transformations might be attributed to the anammox process. Attempts to find other anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing processes in this sediment failed. The apparent Km of nitrite consumption was less than 3 μM, and the relative importance of ammonium <b>oxidation</b> <b>with</b> nitrite and denitrification for the production of nitrogen gas was independent of nitrite concentration. Thus, the quantitative importance of ammonium <b>oxidation</b> <b>with</b> nitrite in the jar incubations at elevated nitrite concentrations probably represents the in situ situation. With the addition of nitrate, the production of nitrite from nitrate was four times faster than its consumption and therefore did not limit the rate of ammonium oxidation. Accordingly, the rate of this process was the same whether nitrate or nitrite was added as electron acceptor. The addition of organic matter did not stimulate denitrification, possibly because it was outcompeted by manganese reduction or because transport limitation was removed due to homogenization of the sediment...|$|R
