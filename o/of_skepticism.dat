5|$|The {{mistrust of}} Standard Oil was {{partially}} {{the result of}} a suspicion toward carpetbaggers, which ironically was also the source <b>of</b> <b>skepticism</b> regarding labor unions. Union organizers were frequently seen as attempting to support a Northern agenda of promoting opportunities for African Americans {{at the expense of the}} white population. Because of the situation this created, labor reform was slow to develop. Despite the anti-union sentiments, groups like the International Oil Workers Union attracted membership and held some influence in the industry and state government.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{structure}} of the army was {{the division of the}} companion cavalry (hetairoi) with the foot companions (pezhetairoi), augmented by various allied troops, foreign levied soldiers, and mercenaries. The foot companions existed perhaps since the reign of Alexander I of Macedon, while Macedonian troops are accounted for in the history of Herodotus as subjects of the Persian Empire fighting the Greeks at the Battle of Plataea in 479 BC. Macedonian cavalry, wearing muscled cuirasses, became renowned in Greece during and after their involvement in the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC), at times siding with either Athens or Sparta and supplemented by local Greek infantry instead of relying on Macedonian infantry. Macedonian infantry in this period consisted of poorly trained shepherds and farmers, while the cavalry was composed of noblemen eager to win glory. An early 4th-century BC stone-carved relief from Pella shows a Macedonian infantryman wearing a pilos helmet and wielding a short sword showing a pronounced Spartan influence on the Macedonian army before Philip II. Nicholas Viktor Sekunda states that at the beginning of Philip II's reign in 359 BC, the Macedonian army consisted of 10,000 infantry and 600 cavalry, the latter figure similar to that recorded for the 5th century BC. However, Malcolm Errington cautions that any figures for Macedonian troop sizes provided by ancient authors should be treated with a degree <b>of</b> <b>skepticism,</b> since there are very few means by which modern historians are capable of confirming their veracity (and could have been possibly lower or even higher than the amount stated).|$|E

40|$|Professional {{skepticism}} is {{a critical}} component of audit practice and current auditing standards direct auditors to remain skeptical throughout the duration of each audit engagement. Despite the importance and prevalence of an emphasis on professional skepticism throughout auditing standards, evidence indicates that auditors often fail to exercise an appropriate degree <b>of</b> professional <b>skepticism.</b> Prior accounting research suggests that auditors’ professionally skeptical behavior is affected by individual personality traits as well as situational (state) influences, whereby both factors contribute to auditor professional skepticism. Yet, prior research has primarily focused on trait skepticism; and little research to date has investigated the concept <b>of</b> state <b>skepticism.</b> The purpose if this research study is to experimentally investigate the impact of time pressure and trait skepticism on state skepticism, and to test a potential debiasing procedure on the impact of time pressure on state skepticism. In addition, this study examines the influence <b>of</b> both <b>skepticism</b> types on skeptical behavior. This research offers several contributions to accounting literature and practice. First, I contribute to the existing debate regarding the influences <b>of</b> professional <b>skepticism</b> by providing evidence that professional skepticism may be categorized as a temporary state, induced by situational aspects, in addition to being classified as an enduring trait. Second, I identify certain situational conditions which create differences in the level <b>of</b> state professional <b>skepticism</b> exhibited within an auditing context. Lastly, my findings may also be important to audit firms as they consider tools within their training arsenal equipped to promote an appropriate level <b>of</b> professional <b>skepticism</b> among employees. If auditor skepticism can be influenced by the frames they are provided, then audit firms may create an environment that promotes consistency in auditors’ application <b>of</b> professional <b>skepticism,</b> simply by engaging in goal framing...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of my dissertation is {{to research and}} to introduce hellenistic <b>skepticism</b> <b>of</b> postclassical Greece and methodical <b>skepticism</b> <b>of</b> modern times thinker Rene Descartes.

I have in view Descartes' skepticism too, which create a methodological technique of cognition in new way. Rene Descartes, contrary to hellenistic skeptics, doesn't accept the "epoche", which means a certain bliss, but he moves on in his research, when he believes in a possibility of truthful cognition. Purpose of my thesis is to critically take account of historical and philosophical context, from which both <b>of</b> <b>skepticisms</b> have been created, to put a question, what kind of meaning they had in history of philosophy and also to think about fundamental question of connection between hellenistic and Descartes doubt.

Organic chemistry has since developed into an independent area of research dedicated to the study of carbon-containing compounds, since that element in common was detected in a variety of nature-derived substances. An important factor in the characterization of organic materials was on the basis of their physical properties (such as melting point, boiling point, solubility, crystallinity, or color).|$|E

25|$|Postmodernism {{describes}} a broad movement that {{developed in the}} mid- to late 20th century across philosophy, the arts, architecture and criticism which marked a departure from modernism.

Instead, it asserts to varying degrees that claims to knowledge and truth are products of social, historical or political discourses or interpretations, and are therefore contextual or socially constructed. Accordingly, postmodern thought is broadly characterized by tendencies to epistemological and moral relativism, pluralism, irreverence and self-referentiality.|$|E
