500|$|Matthew Fort {{reviewed}} the restaurant for The Guardian in 2005, {{he said that}} [...] "there {{is no doubt that}} the Fat Duck is a great restaurant and Heston Blumenthal the most original and remarkable chef this country has ever produced". A. A. Gill for The Times recommended that people should [...] "eat here at least once to find out what is really going <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> mouth". Also in 2005, German food critic Wolfram Siebeck visited the restaurant complained of the delays in service and of several of the dishes, described the mustard ice cream in a red cabbage gazpacho soup as a [...] "fart of nothingness", while chef Nico Ladenis said of the restaurant, [...] "Someone who makes egg and bacon ice cream is hailed a genius. If you vomit and make ice cream out of it, are you a star?" [...] Tony Naylor of The Guardian enjoyed his trip to the restaurant in 2008, and afterwards criticised those who thought that spending £323.13 on a meal for two at lunchtime was too much.|$|E
500|$|Inspiration {{to work on}} Her Story {{stemmed from}} Barlow's {{disappointment}} of other detectives games: he felt that L.A. Noire (2011) never allowed him to feel like [...] "the awesome detective who was having to read things and follow up threads of investigation", and he called the Ace Attorney series (2001–present) [...] "rigidity". When Barlow began development on Her Story, he added more typical game aspects, but the game mechanics became more minimalist as development progressed. The initial plan for the game was for players to work towards a definitive resolution, ultimately solving the crime. However, when Barlow tested the concept on pre-existing interview transcripts of convicted murderer Christopher Porco, he began to discover themes surfacing within the interviews, particularly relating {{to the concept of}} money, which was ultimately a large factor in Porco's trial. He took this concept of recurring themes and threads, and decided to [...] "move beyond the clearly scripted stuff" [...] when developing Her Story. Barlow felt that the story's appeal was the ambiguity of the investigation, comparing Her Story to the podcast Serial (2014–present), which he listened to late in development. He found that the attraction of Serial was the lack of a definitive solution, noting that [...] "people lean towards certain interpretations ... what makes it interesting {{is the extent to which}} it lives <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> imagination".|$|E

2500|$|On January 17, 2009, Allen {{wrestled}} APCW Heavyweight Champion [...] "Bionic" [...] Dan Bidondi in {{an event}} for Action Packed Championship Wrestling at the American Legion Hall in Seekonk, Massachusetts. This was Bidondi's first title defense since winning the title from [...] "Nature Boy" [...] Gary Gold {{who had also}} been suspended from the promotion with his manager Johnny Fabulous. On March 11, he made a second appearance <b>on</b> <b>In</b> <b>Your</b> Head to promote an upcoming New World Wrestling event at Sandwich High School. The event featured former Extreme Championship Wrestling veterans Justin Credible and Spike Dudley. The show was later broadcast live <b>on</b> <b>In</b> <b>Your</b> Head on March 14.|$|E
2500|$|In {{further support}} of In Your Honor, the band decided to {{organize}} a short acoustic tour for the summer of 2006. The tour included members who had also performed with them in late 2005, such as former member Pat Smear, who rejoined the band, Petra Haden on violin and backing vocals, Drew Hester on percussion, and Rami Jaffee of The Wallflowers on keyboard and piano. While much of the setlist focused <b>on</b> <b>In</b> <b>Your</b> Honors acoustic half, the band also used {{the opportunity to play}} lesser-known songs such as [...] "Ain't It The Life", [...] "Floaty", and [...] "See You". The band also performed [...] "Marigold", a Pocketwatch-era song that was best known as a Nirvana B-side.|$|E
2500|$|Although Norwood {{received}} a sole writing credit on album cut [...] "Finally" [...] only, she noted Afrodisiac the most honest effort {{of her career}} yet based on its deeply autobiographical content, commenting: [...] "Everything I do {{has something to do}} with what I've gone through in my life [...] I definitely wanted to incorporate that in my art. It makes it more real when you add what's been going <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> life in your music. I've grown and I've gone through some things in my life, and I celebrate that, I honor that." [...] Soundwise, her collaboration with Timbaland, recent motherhood, life experiences, and growing affinity toward alternative music such as Coldplay, caused Norwood to shift toward a more matured outlook and raw nature with the album, a venture into the organic sounds of soul blues, ambient music, and the nostalgic street-wise sound of 1990’s hip-hop.|$|E

2500|$|In 1952, a {{prescription}} drug ring was discovered in New York where thousands of patients were manipulated to purchase unapproved, high-priced pharmaceuticals. These medications were placed in pharmacies by unethical pharmacists and doctors who partnered to exploit unassuming customers for financial gain. Patients would pay up to 80% more for these unapproved, and presumably poor quality medications. These drug firms were bankrolled by thousands of doctors and pharmacists who purchased shares in the companies. A stern and effective warning was sent out by Barasch, on behalf of Allied Trades Council, to its over 11,000 members, {{many of whom were}} employed in hundreds of drug stores in New York's five boroughs, that [...] "any member of our union found aiding and abetting and joining this criminal hoax on unsuspecting customers will be brought up on charges immediately [...] [...] [...] Wherever and whenever you find evidence that would indicate that this racket is being carried <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> store or plant, call the union immediately [...] [...] [...] Give us all the details and we will turn them over to the proper authorities." ...|$|E
