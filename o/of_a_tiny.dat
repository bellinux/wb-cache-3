5|$|P90 USG:The P90 USG (United States Government) {{model is}} similar to the {{standard}} P90, except the reflex sight housing is aluminium, and the sight has a revised reticle. The black reticle consists <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> dot inside of a small ring, which is joined by three posts that glow red in low light conditions due to tritium-illumination. The USG reflex sight can be removed and replaced with a special MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail mount for attaching a different sight.|$|E
5|$|PS90 USG: The PS90 USG is now discontinued. In {{the same}} fashion as the P90 USG, this model has an {{aluminium}} reflex sight housing with a revised reticle. The black reticle consists <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> dot inside of a small ring, which is joined by three posts that glow red in low light conditions due to tritium-illumination. The USG reflex sight can be removed and replaced with a special MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail mount for attaching a different sight, and like other models of the PS90, the USG was available with either an olive drab or black frame. As of 2011, the PS90 USG model is no longer listed by FNH USA, but the USG reflex sight is still offered as a standalone accessory.|$|E
5|$|The {{residents}} of urban areasin particular Antananarivohave been {{hardest hit by}} economic downturns and economic policy shifts. The national economic crisis in the mid-1970s and early 1980s, and the World Bank's imposition of a structural adjustment program lowered living standards for the average resident of the city. The end of state subsidies, rapid inflation, higher taxes, widespread impoverishment {{and the decline of}} the middle class were especially evident in Antananarivo, as was the growing wealth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> political and economic elite in the city. In 2007, two thirds of Antananarivo residents had access to electricity, while ten percent of households owned a scooter, car or other motor vehicle. Running water was installed in fewer than 25 percent of homes, small restaurants and businesses in 2007, necessitating the collection of water from household wells or neighborhood pumps and the use of outdoor pit toilets detached from the main building. In 2007, 60 percent of households were using shared public latrines. Most homes use charcoal for daily cooking; stocks of charcoal and rice are kept in the kitchen. The average city household spends just under half of its budget on food. Owing to its increasingly high cost, consumption of meat by city residents has sharply declined since the 1970s; the urban poor eat meat on holidays only once or twice a year.|$|E

25|$|One {{factor in}} the project's final failure was {{that even though the}} Cedar Grove dam site was outside the park, the project {{required}} two additional dams to be built upstream if it were to be economically feasible. However, those sites were now inside the park boundary as designated in 1940. On August 6, 1965 Cedar Grove and Tehipite Valley were finally added to the park, making them permanently off-limits to new dams as well. These annexations (with the exception <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> section in 1984, south of Grant Grove) brought Kings Canyon National Park to its present size.|$|E
25|$|After Gaines's Mill, McClellan {{left his}} army {{with no clear}} {{instructions}} on routes of withdrawal and without naming a second-in-command. The bulk of the V Corps (less McCall), under Brig. Gen. Fitz John Porter, moved to occupy Malvern Hill, while the remaining four corps of the Army of the Potomac were essentially operating independently in their fighting withdrawal. Most elements of the army {{had been able to}} cross White Oak Swamp Creek by noon on June 30. About one third of the army had reached the James River, but the remainder was still marching between White Oak Swamp and Glendale. (Glendale was the name <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> community at the intersection of the Charles City Road and the Quaker Road, or Willis Church Road, which led over Malvern Hill to the James River.) After inspecting the line of march that morning, McClellan rode south and boarded the ironclad USS Galena on the James.|$|E

25|$|Together {{with the}} {{teaching}} of the unity of humanity these approaches attracted many of the lower castes. In short order most <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> village of some 200 people converted to the Baha'i Faith en masse. The following year hundreds of people adopted the religion thanks to an open air conference where speeches could be heard. In two more years almost as many people converted as had been Bahá'ís through regions of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat. In 1961 there were a total of 78 Local Spiritual Assemblies and less than 1,000 believers and in 1963 there were some 65,000 and by 1970 these figures had risen to 3,350 Assemblies and 312,602 believers. However, in contrast to the Neo-Buddhist movement no effort was made to denounce Hinduism and progress along Bahá'í ideals advanced - Assemblies formed in response to growing numbers of Baha'is, the House of Worship for India was built, and schools were established - all goals of the 1920, first All-India Baha'i Convention (see above).|$|E
25|$|In 1965 Simpson, {{along with}} his {{students}} and co-workers, built the first cosmic ray (energy particle) detectors to visit Mars. In 1973 {{it was the first}} to visit Jupiter, in 1974 Mercury, and in 1979 Saturn. Jupiter's mission detected the relativistic (3-30 MeV) electron population for the first time which the planet was emitting. This first recognized the electrons contained within the Jovian magnetosphere and then the escaping electrons at distances of at least 1 AU. Simpson's detection in 1974 is what first established that the magnetic fields being observed at Mercury were not being carried from the Sun by the impacting solar wind, but in fact belonged to the planet itself. Simpson had been helping to develop the mission from concept since 1959. Also, in 1980, his detection <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> gap in the distribution of energetic particles trapped in the magnetic field of Saturn indicated to them the presence of a previously undetected small moon there orbiting at that position in space and absorbing particles which would otherwise be found there were there no disruption. Subsequently, scientists became able to identify Saturn's moon optically. In 1976 and 1982 Simpson also detected bursts of energetic particles associated with the passage of shock waves in the solar wind, and provided evidence that the transition serves as an efficient accelerator of particles, and provided a basis for further studies.|$|E
25|$|The {{foundations}} of the British Indian Empire were laid by Sir Francis Day in the sandy delta <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> river, some {{three and a half}} miles north of Saint Thomas, with the beginnings of Fort St. George. The British invited the Portuguese of pure and mixed descent to settle in the new township; and as the Portuguese were Catholics, they were ministered to by the clergy from Saint Thomas. In 1642, the Congregation of Propaganda sent out two French Capuchins to establish a mission in Burma. But when they, landing at Surat and travelling overland, reached Fort St. George, the British persuaded them not to go further, judging it prudent to have clergymen differing in nationality from, and independent of, the Portuguese ordinary at Saint Thomas to minister to the Catholics in their settlement. Accordingly, R. P. Ephraim', one of the two, wrote to the Sacred Congregation de propaganda fide that there was a prospect of reaping a larger harvest at Fort St. George and the fast rising native town of Madras that was beside it, than in Burma; and in the name of Urban VIII an Apostolic prefecture was established within three and a half miles of the cathedral of Saint Thomas. Ever after there were continual bickerings between the local ordinaries and the French Capuchins, the former insisting on the Capuchins acknowledging their jurisdiction, a claim which the latter, relying on their papal Brief, refused to recognize.|$|E
