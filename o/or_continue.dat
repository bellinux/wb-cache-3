5|$|Finished in Java, Beebe and {{his crew}} sailed north from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur to begin {{exploring}} Malaya. After Malaya, the next portion of their expedition took them to Burma, where they arrived in Rangoon and traveled by rail to Myitkyina. In Burma Beebe succumbed temporarily to a bout of depression, and it was several days before {{he was able to}} resume working <b>or</b> <b>continue</b> the expedition.

5|$|The names at {{that point}} {{remained}} unofficial, but in 2016 the IAU organised a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardise proper names for stars. In its first bulletin of July 2016, the WGSN explicitly recognised the names of exoplanets and their host stars that were produced by the competition. Epsilon Eridani is now listed as Ran in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.

5|$|After metamorphosis, {{young adults}} may {{disperse}} into terrestrial habitats <b>or</b> <b>continue</b> {{to live in}} water. Almost all frog species are carnivorous as adults, preying on invertebrates, including arthropods, worms, snails, and slugs. A few of the larger ones may eat other frogs, small mammals, and fish. Some frogs use their sticky tongues to catch fast-moving prey, while others push food into their mouths with their hands. A few species also eat plant matter; the tree frog Xenohyla truncata is partly herbivorous, its diet including {{a large proportion of}} fruit, Leptodactylus mystaceus has been found to eat plants, and folivory occurs in Euphlyctis hexadactylus, with plants constituting 79.5% of its diet by volume. Adult frogs are themselves attacked by many predators. The northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens) is eaten by herons, hawks, fish, large salamanders, snakes, raccoons, skunks, mink, bullfrogs, and other animals.|$|E

5|$|As {{the combat}} raged {{at the head}} of the line, the {{remainder}} of both squadrons strained to join the battle. The British eastern division under Louis reached the battling Alexandre and Spencer at 10:35, the two ships locked together to the south of the main engagement. As they passed, Canopus, Donegal and Atlas all raked the French ship, bringing down all of her masts and leaving her in a crippled state. Canopus then steered directly towards the battle around Impérial, as Donegal and Atlas turned northwest to intercept Brave and Jupiter respectively. At 11:00, Spencer followed Canopus while Alexandres crew were preoccupied with extinguishing a fire that had broken out on board. Alexandre was so badly damaged that she was unable to either escape <b>or</b> <b>continue</b> the action; she formally surrendered ten minutes later.|$|E
5|$|As {{the family}} eats breakfast the next morning, Lois reveals her {{intention}} {{to become a}} surrogate mother for Naomi and Dale, causing Peter to become upset {{at the thought of}} her being pregnant for nine months. Despite this, Lois decides to go to Dr. Hartman to have the in vitro fertilization performed, enduring more of Dr. Hartman's shtick involving celebrity crossbreeds and having a tribe of bush men implant the egg with blowguns. A pregnancy test comes back positive the next day, and a furious Peter attempts to cause Lois to have a miscarriage before ultimately confronting her about the pregnancy. While she continues asserting her intention to provide a child to Naomi and Dale, Quahog 5 News suddenly reveals that Naomi and Dale died in a car crash on Interstate 95. Devastated by the announcement, Lois questions whether she should have an abortion <b>or</b> <b>continue</b> with the pregnancy and put the baby up for adoption.|$|E
5|$|Deal Castle was {{increasingly}} resembling a private house, rather than purely a fortification, and {{this led to}} arguments in 1829 {{as to whether it}} should be subject to local taxation as a private dwelling, <b>or</b> <b>continue</b> to be exempt as a military site. The captaincy had long since become an honorary position, given out as a reward by the Crown. In 1898, the War Office agreed that the Office of Works should be consulted over any external alterations to the historic castle, and that the Office of Works would be responsible for paying for any resulting work. The War Office finally concluded in 1904 that the castle no longer had any value either as a defence or as a barracks, and transferred it entirely to the Office of Works. When the captain was not in residence it was opened to visitors.|$|E

5|$|In April 2011, Paul filed {{to run for}} {{re-election}} to his Senate seat in 2016. Had he become the Republican presidential (or vice-presidential) nominee, state law would prohibit him from simultaneously running {{for re-election}}. In March 2014, the Republican-controlled Kentucky Senate passed {{a bill that would}} allow Paul to run for both offices, but the Democratic-controlled Kentucky House of Representatives declined to take it up. Paul spent his own campaign money in the 2014 legislative elections, helping Republican candidates for the State House in the hopes of flipping the chamber, thus allowing the legislature to pass the bill (Democratic Governor Steve Beshear's veto can be overridden with a simple majority). However, the Democrats retained their 54–46 majority in the State House. Paul has since given his support to the idea that the Kentucky Republican Party could decide to hold a caucus rather than a primary, potentially giving Paul more time to decide whether he should run for U.S. Senator <b>or</b> <b>continue</b> a potential bid for President.|$|E
5|$|In April, DiBiase made an {{ultimatum}} to Maryse {{for her to}} choose to continue on the NXT <b>or</b> <b>continue</b> with him. The following week, Maryse chose to continue appearing on NXT, disbanding their alliance in the process. As part of the 2011 supplemental draft on April 26, DiBiase {{was moved to the}} SmackDown brand. In his first match on SmackDown, DiBiase lost to his former tag team partner Cody Rhodes. The following week, DiBiase was accompanied to the ring by Rhodes. On the June 3 episode of SmackDown, DiBiase lost to former rival, Daniel Bryan via submission. After the match, Rhodes and DiBiase attacked Bryan, but were stopped by Sin Cara. On the July 8 episode of SmackDown, DiBiase teamed with Rhodes in a winning effort against the team of Bryan and Ezekiel Jackson. After DiBiase lost a match against Randy Orton on the August 26 episode of SmackDown, Rhodes attacked him, ending their association.|$|E
5|$|Monolith Soft {{was founded}} by Tetsuya Takahashi, a {{developer}} who had previously worked at Nihon Falcom and later at Square, in which the latter was merged into Enix in 2003 to form Square Enix. While at Square, {{he and his wife}} Kaori Tanaka (also known as Soraya Saga) would {{contribute to the development of}} multiple titles including entries in the Final Fantasy series. Following their work on Final Fantasy VI, Takahashi and Tanaka created a proposal for Final Fantasy VII; while deemed to dark for the Final Fantasy series, they were allowed to develop it as their own project titled Xenogears. Takahashi's ambition and drive prompted Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, then Executive Vice President at Square, to appoint him as director. Takahashi also wrote the script with Tanaka. Following the release of Xenogears, Takahashi became dissatisfied with Square's business approach at the time, which prioritized their major intellectual properties including Final Fantasy. This left Takahashi with no funding or creative room to develop further independent projects <b>or</b> <b>continue</b> his planned Xenogears series.|$|E

5|$|On {{the south}} side of Holland, the two {{highways}} split apart; US31 separates from I-196 at a partial interchange near the West Michigan Regional Airport (formerly the Tulip City Airport). At this interchange, northbound traffic may follow a left exit to continue on the BL I-196/US31 freeway <b>or</b> <b>continue</b> along I-196 which turns more eastward; the LMCT departs I-196 at this point as well. Signage along I-196 changes after this interchange. Up to this point, it had been signed north–south, but from the US31 split onward, the directions are now signed east–west. The freeway passes to {{the south side}} of the airport, and it crosses a rail line owned by CSX Transportation and used by Amtrak's Pere Marquette train before curving northeasterly through the interchange with M-40. The freeway crosses into Ottawa County south of the Macatawa River before meeting the other two interchanges for Holland, the second of which is the northern end of the business loop in Zeeland.|$|E
5|$|Several {{minutes after}} initial radar contact the two forces sighted each other, {{at about the}} same time, but both Abe and Callaghan hesitated {{ordering}} their ships into action.

He decided to continue onward. Callaghan apparently intended to attempt to cross the T of the Japanese, as Scott had done at Cape Esperance, but—confused by the incomplete information he was receiving, plus the fact that the Japanese formation consisted of several scattered groups—he gave several confusing orders on ship movements, and delayed too long in acting.|$|E
5|$|Wizards & Warriors III is a {{platforming}} {{video game}} which features open-ended gameplay elements similar to games such as Metroid and Faxanadu.
