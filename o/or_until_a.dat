5000|$|A {{selector}} ( [...] and subclasses) {{provides a}} mechanism for waiting on channels and recognizing when one or more become available for data transfer. When a number of channels are registered with the selector, it enables blocking of the program flow until at least one channel is ready for use, <b>or</b> <b>until</b> <b>an</b> interruption condition occurs.|$|R
25|$|Outdoor or field polo {{consists}} of four to eight 7-minute chukkas, between or during which players change mounts. At {{the end of each}} 7 minute chukka, play continues for an additional 30 seconds <b>or</b> <b>until</b> <b>a</b> stoppage in play, whichever comes first. There is a four-minute interval between chukkas and a ten-minute halftime. Play is continuous and is only stopped for penalties, broken tack (equipment) or injury to horse or player. The object is to score goals by hitting the ball between the goal posts, no matter how high in the air. If the ball goes wide of the goal, the defending team is allowed a free 'knock-in' from the place where the ball crossed the goal line, thus getting ball back into play.|$|E

MOD {{alternates}} between getting the sparse coding using a method such as matching pursuit and updating the dictionary by computing the analytical {{solution of the}} problem given by [...] where [...] is a Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse. After this update [...] is renormalized to fit the constraints and the new sparse coding is obtained again. The process is repeated until convergence (<b>or</b> <b>until</b> <b>a</b> sufficiently small residue).|$|E
2500|$|At each step, the SA {{heuristic}} considers some {{neighbouring state}} s' {{of the current}} state s, and probabilistically decides between moving the system to state s' or staying in state s.

2500|$|Marine Corps marksmanship {{qualification}} badges {{are suspended}} beneath a bar reading {{the type of}} weapon and qualification received. [...] The badge is also different in appearance, depending on which weapon qualification has been obtained. [...] For a marksmanship qualification badge to be obtained, a service member must obtain a passing score and will receive a qualification level depending on the score obtained. [...] Once a qualification has been obtained, and the marksmanship badge issued, the badge may be worn {{for the remainder of}} a military career, <b>or</b> <b>until</b> <b>a</b> different level of qualification (higher or lower) is achieved.|$|E

2500|$|The vast {{majority}} of births occur between October and December with half of them occurring in October. The parenting of the topi has characteristics of both the [...] "hider" [...] system (found in the blesbok) and the [...] "follower" [...] system (found in the blue wildebeest). Calves can follow their mothers immediately after birth and [...] "may not 'lie out'". On the other hand, females separate themselves from the herd to calve and calves commonly seek hiding places during the night. A young topi stays with its mother for a year <b>or</b> <b>until</b> <b>a</b> new calf is born. Both yearling males and females {{can be found in}} bachelor herds.|$|E
2500|$|Note †: The {{unbounded}} μ operator {{will continue}} this attempt-to-match process ad infinitum <b>or</b> <b>until</b> <b>a</b> match occurs. Thus the [...] "y" [...] register must be unbounded -- {{it must be}} able to [...] "hold" [...] a number of arbitrary size. Unlike a [...] "real" [...] computer model, abstract machine models allow this. In the case of a bounded μ operator, a lower-bounded μ operator would start with the contents of y set to a number other than zero. An upper-bounded μ operator would require an additional register [...] "ub" [...] to contain the number that represents the upper bound plus an additional comparison operation; an algorithm could provide for both lower- and upper bounds.|$|E

An exclamation now clearly broke from his lips, and for a minute or two the young man actually appeared to be out of his senses. [...] "The pinnace," [...] "the Neshamony," [...] however, were words that escaped him, and, had there been a witness, might have given an insight into this extraordinary conduct. Mark had, in fact, ascertained that the sail beneath the peak was no other than the little craft that had been swept away, as already described, with Betts in it. Fourteen months had elapsed since that occurrence, and here it was again, seemingly endeavouring to return to the place where it had been launched! Mark adopted perhaps the best expedient in his power to attract attention to himself, and to let his presence be known. He fired both barrels of his fowling-piece, and repeated the discharges several times, <b>or</b> <b>until</b> <b>a</b> flag was shown on board the sloop, which was now just beneath the cliff, a certain sign that he had succeeded. A musket was also fired from the vessel.|$|E
60|$|Twenty years ago, {{there was}} no lovelier piece of lowland scenery in South England, nor any more pathetic in the world, by its {{expression}} of sweet human character and life, than that immediately bordering on {{the sources of the}} Wandle, and including the lower moors of Addington, and the villages of Beddington and Carshalton, with all their pools and streams. No clearer or diviner waters ever sang with constant lips of the hand which 'giveth rain from heaven;' no pastures ever lightened in spring time with more passionate blossoming; no sweeter homes ever hallowed the heart of the passer-by with their pride of peaceful gladness--fain-hidden--yet full-confessed. The place remains, <b>or,</b> <b>until</b> <b>a</b> few months ago, remained, nearly unchanged in its larger features; but, with deliberate mind I say, that I have never seen anything so ghastly in its inner tragic meaning,--not in Pisan Maremma--not by Campagna tomb,--not by the sand-isles of the Torcellan shore,--as the slow stealing of aspects of reckless, indolent, animal neglect, over the delicate sweetness of that English scene: nor is any blasphemy or impiety--any frantic saying or godless thought--more appalling to me, using the best power of judgment I have to discern its sense and scope, than the insolent defilings of those springs by the human herds that drink of them. Just where the welling of stainless water, trembling and pure, like a body of light, enters the pool of Carshalton, cutting itself a radiant channel down to the gravel, through warp of feathery weeds, all waving, which it traverses with its deep threads of clearness, like the chalcedony in moss-agate, starred here and there with white grenouillette; just in the very rush and murmur of the first spreading currents, the human wretches of the place cast their street and house foulness; heaps of dust and slime, and broken shreds of old metal, and rags of putrid clothes; they having neither energy to cart it away, nor decency enough to dig it into the ground, thus shed into the stream, to diffuse what venom of it will float and melt, far away, in all places where God meant those waters to bring joy and health. And, in a little pool, behind some houses farther in the village, where another spring rises, the shattered stones of the well, and of the little fretted channel which was long ago built and traced for it by gentler hands, lie scattered, each from each, under a ragged bank of mortar, and scoria; and brick-layers' refuse, on one side, which the clean water nevertheless chastises to purity; but it cannot conquer the dead earth beyond; and there, circled and coiled under festering scum, the stagnant edge of the pool effaces itself into a slope of black slime, the accumulation of indolent years. Half-a-dozen men, with one day's work, could cleanse those pools, and trim the flowers about their banks, and make every breath of summer air above them rich with cool balm; and every glittering wave medicinal, as if it ran, troubled of angels, from the porch of Bethesda. But that day's work is never given, nor will be; nor will any joy be possible to heart of man, for evermore, about those wells of English waters.|$|E
