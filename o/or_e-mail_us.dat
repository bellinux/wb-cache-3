40|$|Greetings Dear {{readers of}} TOJDE,I {{am pleased to}} inform you that Volume 6, Number: 4 are {{appearing}} on your screen now as which is addressed [URL] Very much {{thanks to all of you}} once more that we met 19 th time, since January 2000. As we announced in Volume: 6 Number: 3 - 4 issue, April 2006 issue of TOJDE would published on special issue is to indicate foresight, innovation, and strategy for the future direction of e-learning, more than web-oriented teaching and multipoint videoconferencing, for collaborative, distributed, experiential learning and creation of new knowledge, with youngsters around the world, which hence promote mutual understanding for global peace. Emphasis will be on knowledgeable and inspiring papers (but not limited) on the use of GRID networking technology with distributed computer simulation for experiential (hands-on) learning through broadband Internet, across national, continental and oceanic boundaries. Subjects are in any fields of e-learning and e-healthcare/telemedicine, in research, case studies, project descriptions, implementation, and reports from the field or book review. I would like to announce for all you, that Volume: 7 Number: 2 will publish as the 4 th Special Theme Issue of TOJDE in April 2006. This issue will be prepare by Guest Editor Takeshi UTSUMI, Ph. D., P. E. (Founder and V. P. for Technology and Coordination of Global University System (GUS), USA) and Guest Co-Editor Associate Professor Piet KOMMERS (from University of Twente, The Netherlands). In this issue we published 13 articles, three reviews, some news and announcements for our readers. The first article is coming from USA. Author is one of our recent authors; his name is Dr. Scott L. WALKER. This time he wrote on “Modifying Formative Evaluation Techniques For Distance Education Class Evaluation” subject. He indicates in his article that “Post-secondary classes are usually followed by mandatory summative evaluations, yet changes in teaching and course structure cannot be made with summative evaluations. Formative evaluations in online education can result in candid responses from students if a third-party facilitator is involved in the process” Second article is from Mustafa Koc. He is Turkish but he is studying in USA as doctorate candidate. His subject is dealing with “Individual Learner Differences in Web-based Learning Environments: From Cognitive, Affective and Social-cultural Perspectives”. He points out in his article that “…. individual differences in web-based learning, also known as online instruction, online training or distance education were examined and implications for designing distance education” for discussing in the field. It is really good article for contemporary discussion for me and for our readers. And than third article is about “Media in Distance Learning: The Nigerian National Teachers Institute Distance Education Programme” which is written by Mudasiru Olalere YUSUF (Ph. D) and Ayotunde Atanda FALADE from Department of Curriculum Studies and Educational Technology, Faculty of Education University of Ilorin, of Nigeria. They mentioned in their article that “…investigated the use of media by distance learners enrolled in the NTI distance education programme. Two hundred and fifty five distance learners drawn from Oyo State, Nigeria, completed a questionnaire to determine the use of media, and factors militating against their effective use by distance learners”. The results are very interesting. The fourth article is dealt with “Analyzing E-mail communication of prospective learners”, by Dr. Vibha and Anurag, from India. In this article; Vibha and Anurag mentioned their thoughts that computer has replaced all means of communication significantly. E-mail is the most popular means of communication through computers. It has vanished the boundaries between the cities, countries and continents. So, their study tries to analyze the e-mail responses of the people who either by surfing IGNOU’s website or from other sources came to know about the various programs of studies offered by the School of Education. The fifth article came from Turkey this time, Marmara University. He indicates in his article that “A Conceptual Framework for the Electronic Performance Support Systems within IBM Lotus Notes 6 (LN 6) Example”. Dr. Servet points out in his article that the concept of Electronic Performance Support Systems (EPSS) is containing multimedia or computer based instruction components that improves human performance by providing process simplification, performance information and decision support system. A conceptual framework of EPSS is constructed under five interrelated and interdependent domains for educational implications. The domains of the framework are online collaboration, cost-effectiveness, motivation, service management, and performance empowering. IBM Lotus Notes 6 (LN 6) is used as an example application tool to illustrate the power of this framework. The framework describes a set of relevant events based upon deductive analyses for improving our understanding of the EPSS and its implications on education and training. The article is also pointed out that there are some similarities between the EPSS’ and the LN 6 ’s specific features within this conceptual framework. It can provide some guidelines and benefits to researchers, educators, and designers as well. Now lets talks about the sixth article which is written by Assoc. Prof Aytekin Isman and Fahme DABAJ, from Faculty of Education EMU-NCTR. Their subject was about “Diffusion of Distance Education in North Cyprus” In this papers Rogers’ diffusion theory (1995) was used to analyze the acceptance and implementation of distance education in institutions of higher learning in north Cyprus. The four main elements of the diffusion paradigm [...] the innovation, communication channels, time, and a social system [...] were used to analyze the North Cyprus distance education project. The results of this research indicate that the Rogers’ four elements were useful in analyzing the innovation of distance education in North Cyprus. Dr. Yuliang LIU was one of older authors of TOJDE. The article which is entitled “Impact of Online Instruction on Teachers’ Learning and Attitudes toward Technology Integration”, Dr. Yuliang LIU, implies that quasi-experimental study was designed to explore the potential impact of online instruction in a graduate course affects K- 12 teachers’ attitudes towards technology integration in schools and learning performance in the United States. This study used a nonequivalent control group design. Nineteen participants in both the experimental group (online section) and control group (traditional section) were pretested and posttested with the Stages of Concerns (SoC) Questionnaire in the fall semester of 2003. Due to the unbalanced participants in the experimental and control groups, the nonparametric statistic procedure was used to examine the differences between two groups. The Mann-Whitney U test indicated a significant difference only existed in stage 2 -personal stage in both raw score and percentile score between the online and traditional sections. That is, online instruction significantly promoted online learner’s concern only in stage 2 -personal stage. No significant differences were found in other six stages of SoC questionnaire between the two groups. In addition, no significant differences were found in students’ final course grades between two groups. Implications for K- 12 teacher education were proposed. The eight article is from Anadolu University which is written by Dr. Cemil Ulukan, on the subject that “Transformation of University Organizations: Leadership and Managerial Implications”. He is telling on technology and globalizations are forcing higher education institutions to transform themselves. In this paper, he aims to contribute to a better understanding the leadership and managerial implications of recent developments for higher education. Reviewing unique characteristics and the fundamental changes shaping higher education, the paper examines the need for organizational transformation and the major managerial implications. When we click the nineth paper you will see the article which is written by Prof. Dele BRAIMOH, National University of Lesotho, SOUTH AFRICA and Dr. Rebecca LEKOKO, University of Botswana, South Africa. My dear authors indicate in their paper aim is to stimulate dialogue on the significance, scope of coverage and the processes of formulating a policy framework for maintaining academic excellence as opposed to mediocrity. We are, however, mindful of the fact that practices are diverse in the region, but regardless of this diversity, a regional policy framework is possible to regulate the planning, development and implementation of quality distance education Programmes across all levels of education, with particular focus on higher institutions of learning. The tenth article was sent to TOJDE by Dr. I. Ahmed M. J. SADIIG is from Malaysia, International Islamic University Gombak. Dr. I. Ahmed M. J. SADIIG emphasizes in his article that the traditional learning paradigm involving face-to-face interaction with students is shifting to highly data-intensive electronic learning with the advances in Information and Communication Technology. An important component of the e-learning process is the delivery of the learning contents to their intended audience over a network. A distributed learning system is dependent on the network for the efficient delivery of its contents to the user. Next article is again from Malaysia, which written by group of Hanafi ATAN, Zuraidah A. RAHMAN, Omar MAJID, Noraida A. GHANI and Rozhan M IDRUS. In their article, they discuss on “The Support System in Distance Education: Factors Affecting Achievements Among Women Learners”. It is very important subject for TOJDE’s publishing philosophy. They indicate in their paper that “reports on the study undertaken to elucidate the dimensions of the support system provided by the School of Distance Education (SDE), Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) to its women learners that would have significant impact on their achievements. The factorial analysis conducted revealed that the role of the faculty is the main contributing factor affecting these achievements, followed by the provision of the intensive course, the electronic portal, video conferencing and to a much lesser extent, the existence of the regional centers. The implications of this study are discussed with the view of improving the support system provided by the institution and the need to put into action the necessary strategies to further improve the achievement of the women learners”. The twelfth article is given a place from Akdeniz University, Antalya, Turkey. Authors are discuses in their article for “students’ perceptions and attitudes towards distance education based on their gender, school types attended, age and access to educational technology such as computer and internet. This paper also describes the specific program used by the faculty of Law at Akdeniz University, Turkey”. And, the last article which is thirteenth one about is “Communication Barriers: A Study of Eastern Mediterranean University Students’ and Teachers’ of Online Program and Courses" from Nor then Cyprus and Turkey. The authors are Dr. Isman and Res. Ass. Fahriye. They points out for the subject that “Therefore; multiple qualitative and quantitative research approaches under mixed approach are used to be aware of communication barriers in online context and make participants to revamp the system by eliminating the weaknesses of the existing system and adapting to new trends that teachers and students have experienced”. Two book reviews were on “Case Studies in Knowledge Management”, edited by Murray Jennex Hersley, published by Idea Group, in April 2005 and reviewed by Dr. Adnan BOYACI, Anadolu University, Eskişehir-TURKEY” and other one is “Advances in Electronic Marketing”, edited by Irvine Clarke III and Theresa Flaherty, 2005, published again by Idea Group in 2005 and reviewed by Dr. Ayhan YILMAZ, Anadolu University, Eskişehir-TURKEY. Conferece review covers an evaluation of “The Fifth International Educational Technology Symposium”, which was held in Sakarya University, between the dates 21 – 23 September 2005 and reviewed by Mubin KIYICI, Sakarya University, TURKEY, for TOJDE readers.

40|$|Greetings Dear {{readers of}} TOJDE, TOJDE is {{appeared}} {{on your screen}} now as Volume 9, Number: 3. This is the third issue of the year 2008. In this issue is published 1 Note for Editor, 15 articles, already 2 book reviews and this time 27 authors from 11 different countries are placed. These published articles are from Australia, Germany, Greece, India, Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Romania, SriLanka, Turkey and USA. Notes for Editor is arrived to TOJDE from Nigeria and written by E. C. IBARA. In his paper examines the processes leading to administration of face-to-face examination in distance education with focus on the National Open University of Nigeria. It highlighted some procedures such as test development, test administration and post test administration/award procedures. Quality management initiatives provide a feasible path for incorporating distance training, whether via the Internet, audio conferencing, video conferencing, or postal delivering methods. The first article of this issue is coming from USA, from Rachel D. ECHARD and Zane L. BERGE, on “Quality Management Builds Solid Etraining”. Their paper will explore the manifestations of quality management processes on sustaining distance training in a business environment. The Second article is “Conducting A Trial of Web Conferencing Software: Why, How, And Perceptions From The Coalface”, written by Shirley REUSHLE and Birgit LOCH from The University of Southern Queensland, Australia. This paper reports on the trial of web conferencing software conducted at a regional Australian university with a significant distance population. The paper shares preliminary findings, the views of participants and recommendations for future activity. To design and conduct the trial, an action research method was chosen because it is participative and grounded in experience, reflecting the context and objectives of the trial. The third article is from India. The third one is on “Distance Education In The Age Of Globalization: An Overwhelming Desire Towards Blended Learning”, written by Satya Sundar SETHY, Indira Gandhi National Open University. The aim {{of this paper is}} to discuss the nature and status of distance education in the age of globalization, i. e. how best it fits for the present educational scenario. In this connection, it is discussing how Blended Learning (hence after, BL) is one among the other learning strategies mostly helpful for the learners. The fourth article arrived from Anadolu University, Turkey on “The Validity And Reliability Studies of The Computer Anxiety Scale on Educational Administrators (CAS-EA) ” an written by Esmehan Agaoglu and her team. This study aims at investigating the validity and reliability studies of the “Computer Anxiety Scale”. And the “Computer Anxiety Scale of Educational Administrators” (CAS-EA) was developed as a result. The fifth article from Greece, on “The Organisation of A Distance Postgraduate Dance Programme And The Participation of Students Specialising in Dance”, written by Dimitris GOULIMARIS, Maria KOUTSOUBA and Yiannis GIOSOS. The aim of their study is to research the factors which constitute the behaviour of students participating in distance postgraduate programmes of studies in dance and to detect any difference in their behaviour that stems from characteristics such as gender and previous dance experience. The sample of the study consisted of 71 male and female students who had chosen to specialise in Greek traditional dance in three Departments of Physical Education of Greece, where the specific specialisation is offered. From the results of the study, it is observed that there is a moderately positive tendency to participate in a postgraduate programme of studies in dance. The sixth article which is entitled as “Reasons For Student Discontinuation in Engineering Degree Courses Offered At A Distance”, sent and written by S. Anbahan ARIADURAI and Rajalingam MANOHANTHAN from The Open University of Sri Lanka, SRI LANKA. Their paper investigates the reasons for low completion rates in the faculty and suggests ways and means to overcome this problem. The study concludes that increasing student numbers will not necessarily increase percentage of students completing the programme though the number of students completing is increased. It is found that students offering courses for the first time in the system of distance education in their academic career perform poorer because they are not conversant with distance education techniques. It is recommended that the Faculty must offer an orientation programme on distance education to all the students enrolling for the first time, before they commence their regular programmes. The seventh article is came from Turkey on “An Online Social Constructivist Tool: A Secondary School Experience In The Developing World”, written by Ayse KOK. She mentioned in her paper that with the rapid advances in technology, several online learning tools come onto the stage. Being an online learning delivery tool to support a full range of teaching and learning activities conducted by educational institutions Moodle facilitates online content creation and collaboration by entailing various social and communication tools that support teacher-student, student-student, and teacher-teacher interactions. This paper presents the "Moodling"(Moodle, 2005) experience within a secondary school in a developing country, namely Turkey. Based on a focus discussion group with the foreign language teachers, the author depicts the critical points that need to be taken into consideration so that an effective collaborative online platform for both teachers and students to learn together can exist The 8 th article is arrived to us from again Pakistan. The article which is entitled “Suitability of AIOU Television And Its Impact on Students’ Achievements”, which is written by Syed Abdul SIRAJ, Department of Mass Communication of Allama Iqbal Open University, Islamabad, PAKISTAN. This paper presents and concluded No strong relationship was found between Learning from TV and academic achievement in the AIOU situation. Use of television in the AIOU Situation will be more effective if transmission day, time and duration are adjusted according to the students’ demand and when students’ assignments are based on both textbook and TV programs. Next and the ninth article article is written by Selahattin GONEN and Bulent BASARAN from Diyarbakir University, Turkey. Their paper is entitled as “The New Method Of Problem Solving in Physics Education By Using Scorm-Compliant Content Package”. Their study two basic purposes are presented. First, taking effective feedbacks in the electronic learning environment about the learning level of students at the problem solving which are told in physics lessons and laboratories. Second, providing a possibility for students to repeat the subjects and solved problems by watching and listening, which are told in lessons and laboratories, whenever or wherever they want. For this purpose, in the first step, the problems solved in classroom and laboratories about physics and subject expressions are transferred to digital environment and e-learning materials are developed. In the second step, these materials are converted to standard SCORM (Sharable Content Object Reference Model) package and integrated to Course Management System (CMS). The tenth article is also from Germany and written by Wolfram LAASER, FernUniversität in Hagen. Paper is titled as “Economics of Distance Education Reconsidered”. The economic viability of e-learning projects will be questioned with more scrutiny than in earlier periods. Therefore it seems to be a good opportunity to see what can be learned from past experience in costing distance learning projects and what aspects are added by current attempts to measure economic efficiency. After reviewing early research about costing distance learning some more recent approaches will be discussed, such as eLearning ROI-calculators and the concept of total cost of ownership. Furthermore some microeconomic effects referring to localization of distance learning courses are outlined. Finally several unsolved issues in costing distance education are summarized. The eleventh article arrived from Nigeria, which is titled as “Designing E-Education Supports in E-Health Based Systems”, written by Ikhu-Omoregbe, NICHOLAS. This paper presents the experience gained in designing mobile health care applications is used to proffer e-Education functionalities in the design of healthcare systems to enhance their acceptance in the medical domain. The application discussed, uses the Unified Modelling Language, mobile, and Java-based technologies for its development. The application provides a real-time access to medical information at the points of health-care delivery within health care centres. Continuing education centers mainly organize activities for the society in the fields that have gained importance on the improvement of individuals with a view of career building, improving professional knowledge and skills, achieving new skills and supplying individual development needs. Such centers have been established within universities through the principle of making continuing education accessible to everyone as a starting point for a lifelong learning process. These centers which aim at providing continuing education, implement more flexible programs compared to those executed at higher education institutions. Next article is which numbered as 12, from Turkey. Article is entitled as “Structure and Functions of the Continuing Education Centers at Turkish Universities”, written by Mehmet Metin ARSLAN, from Kirikkale University. In this study, the structure and functions of Continuing Education Centers at Turkish Universities are investigated.

Anbahan ARIADURAI and Rajalingam MANOHANTHAN. The article is entitled as Reasons for Student Discontinuation in Engineering Degree Courses Offered At A Distance. The study concludes that increasing student numbers will not necessarily increase percentage of students completing the programme though the number of students completing is increased. It is found that students offering courses for the first time in the system of distance education in their academic career perform poorer because they are not conversant with distance education techniques. It is recommended that the Faculty must offer an orientation programme on distance education to all the students enrolling for the first time, before they commence their regular programmes. Next and the tenth article is written by Bong Chin WEI, Wawasan Open University, Malaysia. The paper is entitled as “A Multi-Channel Approach For Monitoring Off-Shore Outsourcing Projects for Distance Learning Material Development”. She introduces the outsourcing process in WOU followed by some of the issues faced by the university while working with the offshore writers and the adaptation of course materials. Subsequently, details of the monitoring mechanism used in the outsourcing process will be explained. Lastly, this paper also presents WOU’s future direction in this perspective. The eleventh article arrived from Maharashtra Open University, INDIA, which is titled as “Assessing Effectiveness of Interactive Electronics Lab Simulation: Learner’s Perspective”, written by Chetana H. KAMLASKAR, Maharashtra Open University, INDIA. He focused on electronic lab simulation. Simulation enables learning by doing and provides opportunity to explore the modeled domain. Interactive simulation allows to present information in more dynamic, compelling and interactive way with engaging environment. This paper discusses the application of interactive simulation supporting the actual laboratory session of basic Electronics lab activities. The article is which numbered as 12, from TURKEY. Article is entitled as “The Effectiveness Of Online And Off Line Word Of Mouth Messages On Traditional Course Choice At Tertiary Level, written by N. Serdar SEVER, from Eskisehir Anadolu University Faculty of Communication Science, Eskisehir. This study aims to explain how bachelor of communications students who are enrolled to various courses at Anadolu University value word-of-mouth messages in making a course decision. Use of WOM as a marketing tool in tertiary teaching is not a common practicThe findings of this study indicate that instructors’ previous experiences are not as important as their in-class performances. The thirteenth article is again from Anadolu University, the communication Faculty on “Online Communication Courses: The Developments in The Area of Communication Education” which is written by Murat ATAIZI, Anadolu University, Eskisehir, TURKEY. He says in his article that E-learning as a form of distance education has become one of the essential movements in all levels of education. Almost all of the higher education institutions in Turkey as well as the rest of the world have been trying to offer e-learning opportunities for their students and the staff. Anadolu University in Turkey has a web portal, which is called Anadolu University Internet Supported Education System, which serves to support academicians’ classes via the online system. The aim of this research is to find out the academicians’ teaching method when they use the online support system. Two books are reviewed in this issue. The first one is about “Trends and Issues in Instructional Design and Technology” is a reader friendly reference source on instructional design and technology (IDT) helping both professionals in the field and novice practitioners trying to get used to the trends and concepts of the field. The book is prepared by eminent scholars, Robert A. Reiser, Florida State University and John V. Dempsey University of South Alabama.

40|$|Greetings Dear {{readers of}} TOJDE, I {{am pleased to}} inform you that in the 7 th year of TOJDE is {{appeared}} on your screen now as Volume 7, Number: 4. Very much {{thanks to all of you}} and TOJDE editorial members once more that we managed to publish TOJDE 25 th time, since January 2000. In this issue we published one notes for Editor, 13 articles, two reviews, news and announcements for our readers. 20 authors from seven different countries are placed in this issue. These published articles are from Bangladesh, Germany, Greece, India, Nigeria, South Korea and Turkey. In the “Notes for Editor” section, Dr KURT’s excutive summary is placed via title “Comparative Analysis f Virtual Education Applications”. Dr. Mehmet KURT from Ankara University, Department of Educational Sciences Program of Curriculum and Instruction TURKEY. This summary is his doctorate thesis which is completed on March 2006 at Ankara University. He emphasizes that while in the teaching process they use both synchronous and asynchronous presentation technologies; in order to support course content they use e-mail, web, cd, and course book technologies to provide basic learning environment function; they prefer different environments to cover face to face education needs; they take self learning and collaboration as basis and they take projects and term paper evaluations serious; they mostly prefer multiple choice tests and they usually make virtual courses exams through the internet. Regarding the characteristics of their institutions’ applications, the study group have agreed on mostly to connection and being dependent on connection opportunities. A significant difference between their institutions’ characteristics and the model for developing computer labs, when they had started to provide virtual lessons and presentation technologies used has been found. The first article of this issue is coming from Hellenic Open University, GREECE which is written by Paraskevi VASSALA. In his article titled as “The Field Study As an Educational Technique In Open And Distance Learning”. His paper examined that no research has been carried out for the possibility of implementation of this technique in Distance Learning nor have any results of such implementation been studied. This paper comprising of three parts contains a general presentation of the field study as a teaching technique in the first part while in the second part the successive stages of development of this technique in Distance Learning are analyzed. Finally, in the third part the students’ views of Hellenic Open University on this technique are presented. This Paper has been presented at EDEN 2006 Annual Conference: E-Competences for Life, Employment and Innovation "E" is more! E-learning Enabling Education in Evolving Europe. Second article is from India and dealt with “Role and Effectiveness of Electronic Media in Higher Education-With Special Reference to Tamilnadu”, which is written as a joint article by S. ARULCHELVAN and D. VISWANATHAN from Anna University, INDIA. It is research study which was conducted on the patterns of radio listening among different categories of students such as urban and rural, male and female, distance and regular modes, English and other mediums of various branches of study. Examining notions on the possession, purpose, place, frequency, timing and duration of usage of radio programs in higher education in general and specific educational channel in particular, the study has assessed the outcomes indicated by user-satisfaction on radio. Findings of the study revealed that there is inadequate knowledge among students about the existence of educational radio. Opinions on program quality suggested a number of improvements to be made in order to enhance the reach of the media. The suggestions include the need to make the programs more interactive, localized and curriculum-based. In the third article Home-Made learning content management system mentioned by Yavuz AKPINAR and Huseyin SIMSEK, Boğazici University, Faculty of Education, Istanbul, TURKEY. Their paper entitled as “XLearning Object Organization Behaviors in a Home-Made Learning Content Management System”. This study designed, implemented and evaluated a learning content managementThe 4 th articles arrived from Bangladesh Open University on “Developing Course Materials for Open and Distance Learning: BOU Perspective”, which is written by Mohammad Habibur RAHMAN, Bangladesh Open University, BANGLADESH. His paper discusses how to design and develop distance learning course materials and how Bangladesh Open University (BOU) adopted a team approach in developing its formal programs. The fifth article came from Indira Ghandi National Open University, written by Anil K. DIMRI and Anil Kumar MISRA from INDIA, on “Training Programmes for Distance Education Professionals: An Analytical Assessment”. This paper seeks to analyze the impact of training programmes on distance education professionals of Indira Gandhi National Open University, (IGNOU). The objective of the paper is to identify the training needs of Distance Education Professionals to manage distance education affairs of IGNOU, to evaluate the effectiveness of existing training programmes, to develop a feasible training and professional development model for distance education Professionals (DEPs) and to suggest initiatives in existing training for the skill development of DEPs for effective career growth and development. And than based on the analysis a workable training model has also been suggested where emphasis on the Common Training Approach (CTA) has been given besides, work specific training. For the over all professional development of DEPs a suitable training strategy has been worked out which ensures training at different strata that includes primary, secondary & tertiary level considering the experience & job requirements of the professionals. The sixth article which is entitled “A Study of Pre-School Children's School Readiness Related to Scientific Thinking Skills”. It is written by Ozgul Polat UNUTKAN, from Marmara University, Istanbul, TURKEY”. Her paper is examined that to compare school readiness of children who had pre-school experiences and children without such experiences on the basis of scientific thinking skills. This comparison is held in terms of variables of age, gender, and socio economic status. The seventh article is came from too far KOREA which is written by Dr. Paum BREEN. He is from Language Center, Kongneung-Do, Nowon Gu, Seoul, REPUBLIC of KOREA. His paper is entitled as “Coming out of the Darkness of the Past”. In this paper authors are try to gives one example of an innovative teacher training project where a western university, in Rome, Italy, is selflessly showing their African counterparts, in rural Rwanda, how to become fully autonomous in training their future generations. The 8 th article is arrived to us again from Turkey. The article which is entitled "IDENTIFICATION OF GAS COMPONENTS IN LIGHTER BY GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY: An Experiment for The Undergraduate Instrumental Analysis Laboratory Which Can Be Used With Distance Learning Applications”. Written by Soner YAVUZ and Inci MORGIL from Hacettepe University, Faculty of Education, Department of Chemistry Education, Ankara. In their paper indicated that the applications of instrumental analysis lessons, advanced instruments with the needed experiments are needed. During the lessons it is a fact that the more experiments are performed, the more learning will be. For this reason, experiments that do not last long and should be performed with more simple instruments and that increase students’ attention with current events should be developed. It is thought that there is only propane gas in lighters used in daily life. However, in fact, in certain ratios, there are also other gases having similar structure besides propane gas. For these reasons, the identification of gas components in lighter has been thought. To enlighten this situation a simple experiment design has been planned. Next and the ninth article were sent to TOJDE by Terhemba Nom AMBE-UVA. Title of paper is “Interactivity in distance education: The National Open University of Nigeria (NOUN) experience”. Terhemba Nom AMBE-UVA is from School of Arts and Social Sciences National Open University of Nigeria (NOUN). The paper represents a study of students’ experience of interactivity in distance education programmes at the National Open University of Nigeria (NOUN). Through surveys and focus groups with students, facilitators, and administrative support staff, we found out that interactivity is a key determinant of student success rate. Majority of the students are workers in the urban areas who combine “work and learn” which is the motto of NOUN. The survey showed that majority of the students depended on their facilitators as key resource persons and on their peers or study groups both for required and voluntary interactivity to reinforce their learning. This was able to reduce loneliness, boredom and loss of community experienced in distance education. Because NOUN has not completed its Repository, Production, Distribution, and Administration Headquarters (REPRODAhq) and equipped the study centers with up-to-date technological facilities, this frustrated accessibility that is dialectically linked to interactivity. Next three paper from Turkey. The tenth article is written by Bahar BARAN and Kursat CAGILTAY from Department of Computer Education and Instructional Technology, Faculty of Education Middle East Technical University, Ankara, TURKEY It is titled as “Teachers' Experiences in Online Professional Development Environment ”. Their qualitative study aims to explore teachers’ opinions on traditional professional development (PD) courses and their experiences from an online course. 10 teachers from a private school participated in an online professional development (PD) course. After completing the course, they evaluated their PD experience. A focus group discussion and individual interviews were performed to collect data. The teachers determined the problems in traditional PD courses and online PD courses. They generally emphasized the lack of practice in both traditional and online PD courses. Further, abundance of theoretical concepts and context independent examples are determined as other problems. They proposed that PD programs should be developed together by both academician and expert teacher. The eleventh article is written by A. Seda YUCEL from Hacettepe University, Ankara, TURKEY. Her paper topic is on “E-LEARNING APPROACH IN TEACHER TRAINING”. Her paper is indicated that a competitive environment is created in education, which leads to sustainable development. With e-learning environments, students could continue the teacher-learner relationship from different places at different times. E-learning terminates the limitation of time and place while providing learning environments with lower expenses. In learning process, the relationship between teacher, learner and peers has great importance. Individual learning is also important, however, the efficiency of learning together could not be avoided. Achievement depends on support and individuals need assistance in learning topics. Therefore, teachers of e-learning programs need to have a serious in-service training; because, many e-learning programs require mutual interaction via technological tools. The word “electronic” as a prefix for e-learning, does not only mean that learning occurs with technological tools but also requires the awareness in developing technologies. So, teachers of e-learning programs need to be trained in information technologies and Internet in order to gather with their students in virtual classrooms. Additionally, they have to have the ability to administer all applications successfully and to follow the developments in pioneer countries in e-learning and distance learning. Next article is which numbered 12, from Turkey. Article is entitled as “COMPUTER SIMULATIONS IN SCIENCE EDUCATION: Implications for Distance Education”, and written by Dr. Sami SAHIN, Gazi University, Ankara. This paper is akind of review of the literature about the use of computer simulations in science education. This review examines the types and good examples of computer simulations. Author says that literature review indicated that although computer simulations cannot replace science classroom and laboratory activities completely, they offer various advantages both for classroom and distance education. Hiis paper consists of four parts. The first part describes computer simulations; the second part reviews the benefits in science education; the third part looks for the relation with science process skills; and the last part makes connections with the distance education. The literature suggests that the success of computer simulations use in science education depends on how they incorporated into curriculum and how teacher use it. The most appropriate use of computer simulations seems that use them for a supplementary tools for classroom instruction and laboratory. Multimedia supported, highly interactive, collaborative computer simulations appealing growing interest because of their potentials to supplement constructivist learning. They offer inquiry environments and cognitive tools to scaffold learning and apply problem-solving skills. Computer simulations are good tools to improve students’ hypothesis construction, graphic interpretation and prediction skills. The literature review also implied that computer simulations have potential for distance education laboratories. Yet this area is elusive and needs to be researched further. The thirteenth and the las article is from GERMANY which written by Dr. Wolfram LAASER, FernUniversität in Hagen/ZFE. His article is entitled as “Virtual Universities for African and Arab Countries”. In his paper, he discusses five of these projects differing in scope, structure and funding namely the Virtual African University, the Avicenna Project, the Virtual Arab University, the Syrian Open University and the proposal for a Virtual University for the Small States. From the analysis of the respective projects some tentative conclusions will be derived. One of two reviews is conference review which is held by my university titled as 2 nd International Open and Distance Learning (IODL) Symposium conducted 13 - 15 September of 2006, in Eskisehir, Turkey. The paper presentations focusing on the Impact of Contemporary and Emerging Media on Open & Distance Learning shared information about virtual learning. In this context, integration of innovative technologies into classrooms, different levels of interaction in interactive environments, characteristics of online higher education institutions regarding educational technology, and ethical issues in online education were discussed. Throughout the symposium, five workshops, six keynote speeches and 66 papers, which were prepared by more than 150 academicians and practitioners from 23 different countries, reflected remarkable and various views and approaches about open and flexible learning. Besides, all these academic endeavors, 13 educational films were displayed during the symposium. The sessions that addressed the most popular theme: The Evaluation and Research in Open and Distance Learning effectively covered the key issues relating to modern e-learning environments, a variety of agents affecting distance education, measurement and evaluation of effectiveness and efficiency of e-learning systems from a range of perspectives. Majority of our presenters highlighted the importance of the preparation of teachers for technology enriched environments and how vital it is to accomplish an efficient and productive open and distance education. The reviewed book is entitled as “Advanced Methods in Distance Education: Applications and Practices for Educators, Administrators and Learners”. It is designed to be theory to practice, with readers gaining the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities to be successful in teaching or training using technology-mediated instruction. Major sections include: Foundations of Teaching and Learning at a Distance, Adult Learning, Instructional Design, Technology Knowledge and Skills, Administrative Issues, and Future Directions. In the other sections are again in the same format as usual as TOJDE’s presenting style. News and some announcements are placed in this issue too.
