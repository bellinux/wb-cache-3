5|$|The gun gallery was {{situated}} in the Recreation Yard and mounted on one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> hall's exterior walls. There was a metal detector outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> hall for security purposes. The dining hall had tear-gas canisters attached to the rafters of the ceiling which could be activated by remote control, should prisoners riot or attempt to escape. The first warden, James A. Johnston, always entered the dining hall alone and unarmed, due to heavy guarding around him. Several riots did break out in the dining hall during Alcatraz's history. Those prisoners who {{were not involved in}} the fighting hid under the dining hall tables to escape possible gunfire.|$|E
5|$|After being {{purchased}} by the Guellers in 2004, the restaurant was redecorated and modernised, the décor having become shabby under previous owners. The new decorations included recessed lighting and fabric-covered walls. There is a fireplace in the centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> room, with an 18th-century settle (a type of bench) beside it. Elements from the Reid and Long era remain, with the bar and ceilings still being recognisable from their time at the restaurant.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, {{the company had}} sold all its hotel operations. The merged company {{retained}} the obligation to operate dining services on the trains, which throughout the 1980s necessitated considerable subsidies from NSB. In 1988, NSB decided to organize the operation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> services through tendered contracts; the first contract (from 1990 through 1995) was won by TogService, a Narvesen subsidiary. The owners had an agreement that neither could sell without {{the approval of the}} other. In 1995 NSB sold its shares with Fritt Ord's approval, and the company was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange.|$|E

The dispute mainly concerned the privatization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> room. At the end of the discussions, most privatization initiatives were rejected, and only a few minor changes that had no practical effect on the collective lifestyle were accepted.|$|E
5|$|The Recreation Yard was {{the yard}} used by inmates {{of the prison}} between 1934 and 1963.

5|$|The {{interior}} of the restaurant has been designed by the Russell Sage Studio, who also worked on other Ramsay establishments, The Savoy Grill and the York and Albany. The claret red theme of previous incarnations of the restaurant has been maintained, and was coupled in the design with leather and polished metalwork. The layout includes a chef's table for six people which overlooks the kitchen. The wine list includes more than 2,000 bottles of wine, and includes 34 different vintages of the French wine Pétrus. They are located in a circular glass room located in the middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> room.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates <b>the</b> intricate intersections <b>of</b> code switching, trickster {{discourse and}} rhetorical sovereignty in <b>the</b> scholarship <b>of</b> <b>Diné</b> author Laura Tohe, as Tohe operationalizes survivance and alliance in complex ways, ways that “actuate a presence” in <b>the</b> face <b>of</b> ongoing attempts to render American Indian peoples absent from American rhetorical, literary, and geographic landscapes. Existing research in American Indian literatures and rhetorics often {{focus on the}} need for reclaiming rhetorical sovereignty. Yet, little work has been done to emphasize connections between <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> code switching, translation, and trickster discourse in order to give visibility to past and contemporary Diné peoples and to decolonize <b>the</b> <b>Diné</b> history. This dissertation uses decolonizing methodologies to demonstrate that Tohe’s writing is an action to regain the sovereignty and visibility that has been torn from the tongues and bodies of American Indian peoples, specifically <b>the</b> <b>Diné,</b> after years <b>of</b> colonization, oppression, and resistance. Chapter one provides the necessary historical context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Diné</b> and <b>the</b> Navajo Long Walk, and chapter two presents an explanation for the various theoretical and critical frameworks for this dissertation. Chapter three provides an explanation about the lens through which the visibility and voice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Diné</b> is exacted through Tohe’s use of rhetorics of survivance and alliance, as well as her attempt to decolonize <b>the</b> <b>Diné</b> history. Chapter four further explores Tohe’s decolonization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Diné</b> history and <b>the</b> reclamation <b>of</b> her rhetorical sovereignty through her use of trickster and trickster discourse, as she attempts to decolonize representations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Diné</b> and provide her own representation {{of what it means to}} be <b>Diné.</b> <b>The</b> dissertation ends with a reevaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> discussions surrounding <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> American Indian texts in an introductory American literature course. Chapter five guides educators in how using a text, such as Tohe’s, is beneficial to not only <b>the</b> promotion <b>of</b> American Indian texts in the classroom, but <b>the</b> necessity <b>of</b> disrupting, adding to, and maintaining our students’ acknowledgment, awareness, and understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> significance <b>of</b> rhetorical sovereignty and <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> those voices of American Indian authors in claiming that sovereignty and resisting colonial attempts to silence them...|$|R

5|$|The only intact public rooms {{remaining}} {{in either the}} stern or bow sections are the First-Class Reception Room and Dining Saloon, both on D-Deck. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dining</b> Saloon has collapsed because of its proximity to the break-up point midships, but the very forward part is accessible and the rectangular leaded glass windows, table bases, and ceiling lamps are noticeably preserved. The Reception Room with its leaded glass windows and mahogany paneling remains remarkably intact, although the ceiling is sagging {{and there is a}} deep layer of silt obstructing the floor. The Turkish Baths on F-Deck were found to be in excellent condition during their rediscovery in 2005, preserving the blue-green tiles, carved teak woodwork, bronze lamps, and inlaid furniture. The Grand Staircase was very likely destroyed during the sinking, but the surrounding First-Class foyers and elevator entrances preserve many of the ormolu and crystal lamps, oak timbers, and oak-framed stanchions.|$|E
5|$|Until World War II, dining at Vassar was {{an elegant}} affair with table linens and serving maids, {{but after the}} war was over, these {{features}} were never brought back to student life. In 1973, the All Campus Dining Center, also called the ACDC or the Deece, opened within the building, serving as a replacement to individual dining rooms {{in each of the}} college's dormitories. The old system had proved too costly and overcrowded, necessitating the ACDC's creation. The $3.5 million renovation was conducted by Walker O. Cain and Associates, with over $1 million of the funds coming from friends and family of Babbott Ladd. An $11 million renovation in 2003 was designed by Finegold Alexander + Associates Inc. Another project, to renovate the kitchen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dining</b> Center and adjust the locations of the building's bathrooms, is underway as of 2016. The changes, undertaken by LTL Architects, total $8–9 million.|$|E

25|$|The {{biggest threat}} {{to the lives of}} the tsar and his family, however, came not from terrorists, but from a {{derailment}} of the imperial train in the fall of 1888.

25|$|The base {{celebrated its}} 40th anniversary in 1980 and enjoyed its most popular years in 1980-81, but usage {{declined}} rapidly and the base closed in 1983. Numerous interrelated factors contributed to its demise, including Scout leaders and executives lobbying for closure {{in favor of}} other bases, declining usage, increased residential development in the area used for its canoe trips, and a heavy snowfall during the 1982-83 winter that collapsed the roof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> hall, which was never rebuilt.|$|E

25|$|Duke University has {{undertaken}} {{a number of}} initiatives designed to improve campus sustainability. The school receives over 30% of its energy needs from wind and hydroelectric power sources, {{making it one of}} the top five purchasers of renewable energy amongst organizations in the field of higher education. The school makes an effort to buy food from local growers, and adjusts the menus of its eateries seasonally. All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> establishments on campus use fair trade coffee, recycled napkins, and are required to recycle and compost.|$|E
25|$|The {{projects}} {{will allow the}} university to receive 15 percent of their purchased energy from these renewable energy resources. Also in 2010, the university's dining hall, Ellicott Dining Hall, installed solar panels which would provide up to 30 percent of the energy for water heating in the dining hall. To do this the university installed 20 panels with 3 solar storage tanks, pumps, temperature sensors, and controls. The system will increasingly provide more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> hall's water needs due to the storage tanks.|$|E
