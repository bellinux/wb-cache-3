50|$|According to the National <b>Crime</b> Records Bureau <b>of</b> India, {{reported}} incidents <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> <b>against</b> women increased 6.4% during 2012, and a <b>crime</b> <b>against</b> a {{woman is}} committed every three minutes. In 2012, there were 244,270 reported incidents <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> <b>against</b> women, while in 2011, there were 228,650 reported incidents. Of the women living in India, 7.5% live in West Bengal where 12.7% of the total reported <b>crime</b> <b>against</b> women occurs.

40|$|Women {{are most}} {{vulnerable}} to crime despite occupying central position in shaping a society as the first teacher of children. In India too, having equal rights and constitutional safeguards, the incidences <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> <b>against</b> them are large and grave. In this context <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> <b>against</b> women, especially rape has been increasing over time. This paper explores the spatial and temporal aspects <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> <b>against</b> women in India with special reference to rape. It also examines the <b>crime</b> <b>against</b> women with its spatial, socio-economic and demographic associates using related data obtained from the National Crime Records Bureau India, Indian Census and other government sources of the Government of India. The simple statistical, choropleth mapping and other cartographic representation methods {{have been used to}} see the crime rates, spatio-temporal patterns <b>of</b> <b>crime,</b> and association <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> with its correlates. The major findings are visible spatial variations across the country and are also in the rising trends in terms of incidence and rates over the reference period. The study also indicates that the geographical associations are somewhat observed. However, selected indicators of socio-economic factors seem to have no significant bearing on <b>crime</b> <b>against</b> women at this level...|$|R

The first war crimes trial of 24 prominent {{figures such as}} Göring, Albert Speer, Joachim von Ribbentrop, Alfred Rosenberg, Hans Frank, and Kaltenbrunner took place beginning in November 1945. They were accused of four counts: conspiracy, waging a war of aggression, war crimes, and crimes against humanity in violation of international law. Twelve received the death penalty, including Kaltenbrunner, who was convicted <b>of</b> <b>crimes</b> <b>against</b> humanity and executed on 16 October 1946.

Members of all of its branches committed war crimes and crimes against humanity during World War II (1939–45). The SS was also involved in commercial enterprises and exploited concentration camp inmates as slave labor. After Nazi Germany's defeat, the SS and the NSDAP were judged by the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg to be criminal organizations. Ernst Kaltenbrunner, the highest-ranking surviving SS main department chief, was found guilty <b>of</b> <b>crimes</b> <b>against</b> humanity at the Nuremberg trials and hanged in 1946.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the role}} of the militants in leading the Uprising, the colonial {{authorities}} immediately accused the MDRM of instigating the movement. This view was echoed by PADESM leaders and shared by the majority of French settlers. The French authorities responded by targeting not only MDRM leaders and members, but also their supporters, drawing the wider population into the conflict. Attacks against the colonial authority in the east were immediately followed by similar actions in the south of the island before rapidly spreading throughout the country. The movement enjoyed particularly strong support in the south, where the revolt attracted as many as one million peasants to fight for the nationalist cause. The French responded with heavy military action and psychological warfare, including incidences <b>of</b> <b>crimes</b> <b>against</b> humanity. Between July and September 1948, most of the key leaders of the Uprising were captured or killed, and the last of the fighters disbanded and fled into the forests in December 1948.|$|E
5|$|Rajoelina faced {{significant}} {{challenges in}} {{his tenure as}} mayor. Upon taking office, he was confronted with redressing the city's treasury, which had accumulated 8.2 billion Malagasy Ariary (approximately 4.6 million U.S. dollars) in debts under previous mayors, including Ravalomanana himself. Beginning 4 January 2008, Ravalomanana ordered water cutoffs at public pumps and brownouts of Antananarivo's street lights run by the state utilities company Jirama, due to 3.3 million ariary of unpaid debts to Jirama by the City of Antananarivo. Rajoelina responded by condemning the move as political and proceeded to undertake an audit that identified and addressed long-standing procedural irregularities and issues of corruption within the city's administration. Following a series <b>of</b> <b>crimes</b> <b>against</b> members of Rajoelina's inner circle in 2008 that comprised the burgling of his cabinet director's car, the kidnapping and ransoming {{of one of his}} special advisers, and the death of an assistant under mysterious circumstances, rumors spread that the Rajoelina administration was being deliberately intimidated by supporters of the president.|$|E

Importantly, confiscation does not always require that a person has been actually convicted <b>of</b> a <b>crime.</b> Recently, there has been significant interest in the provisions of the Act that allow for the confiscation of profits made by a person for selling, publishing or otherwise telling his or her story. Interest in the cases of Mark ?Chopper? Reid, Schapelle Corby and David Hicks has raised questions about the applicability of the existing proceeds <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> laws (including state and territory laws) to people who have profited, or may profit in the future, from their criminal notoriety through book, magazine, film or television deals.

5|$|Soviet rule of Estonia was re-established by force, and sovietisation followed, {{which was}} mostly {{carried out in}} 1944–1950. The forced {{collectivisation}} of agriculture began in 1947, and was completed after the mass deportation of Estonians in March 1949. All private farms were confiscated, and farmers were made to join the collective farms. Besides the armed resistance of the Forest Brothers, a number of underground nationalist schoolchildren groups were active. Most of their members were sentenced to long terms of imprisonment. The punitive actions decreased rapidly after Stalin's death in 1953; from 1956–58, {{a large part of}} the deportees and political prisoners were allowed to return to Estonia. Political arrests and numerous other kind <b>of</b> <b>crimes</b> <b>against</b> humanity were committed all through the occupation period until the late 1980s. After all, the attempt to integrate Estonian society into the Soviet system failed. Although the armed resistance was defeated, the population remained anti-Soviet. This helped the Estonians to organise a new resistance movement in the late 1980s, regain their independence in 1991, and then rapidly develop a modern society.|$|E
5|$|The trial adjourned on 14 August, and {{the verdict}} was read on 12 December.

He was deemed responsible for the dreadful conditions on board the deportation trains and for obtaining Jews to fill those trains. He was found guilty <b>of</b> <b>crimes</b> <b>against</b> humanity, war crimes, and crimes against Poles, Slovenes and Gypsies. He was also found guilty of membership in three organisations that had been deemed criminal at the Nuremberg trials: the Gestapo, the SD, and the SS. When considering the sentence, the judges concluded that Eichmann had not merely been following orders, but believed in the Nazi cause wholeheartedly and had been a key perpetrator of the genocide. On 15 December 1961, Eichmann was sentenced to death by hanging.|$|E

On 10 May 1941 he undertook a solo flight to Scotland, where he hoped to arrange peace talks with the Duke of Hamilton, whom he believed to be prominent in opposition to the British government. Hess was immediately arrested on his arrival and was held in British custody {{until the end of the}} war, when he was returned to Germany to stand trial in the Nuremberg Trials of major war criminals in 1946. During much of the trial, he claimed to be suffering from amnesia, but later admitted this was a ruse. Hess was convicted <b>of</b> <b>crimes</b> <b>against</b> peace and conspiracy with other German leaders to commit crimes and was transferred to Spandau Prison in 1947, where he served a life sentence. Repeated attempts by family members and prominent politicians to win him early release were blocked by the Soviet Union. Still in custody in Spandau, he died by suicide in 1987 at the age of 93. After his death the prison was demolished to prevent it from becoming a neo-Nazi shrine.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, the ICTY {{secretly}} indicted Arkan for {{war crimes}} carried out in Sanski Most in 1995, but not for those in Bijeljina.

In 1999, Milošević was indicted for carrying out a genocidal campaign that included Bijeljina and other locations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, among other charges, but he died mid-trial in March 2006. In February 2000, Plavšić and Momčilo Krajišnik, the speaker of the National Assembly of Republika Srpska, were indicted for the same genocidal campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina, among other charges. On 2 October 2002, Plavšić pleaded guilty to persecuting the non-Serb populations in 37 municipalities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including Bijeljina. This plea was entered under an agreement that involved the prosecution moving to dismiss the remaining charges. She was subsequently sentenced to 11 years imprisonment. On 27 September 2006, Krajišnik was found guilty on a five counts <b>of</b> <b>crimes</b> <b>against</b> humanity, including the same count as Plavšić regarding the persecution of non-Serb populations in municipalities including Bijeljina, but he was found not guilty of genocide. In 2009, he was handed a twenty-year prison sentence. After serving two-thirds of her sentence, Plavšić was released in October 2009. Krajišnik was released in August 2013, having served two-thirds of his sentence (including time spent in custody).|$|E
