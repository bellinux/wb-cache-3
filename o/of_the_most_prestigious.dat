5|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>prestigious</b> {{clubs in}} Australia was the Melbourne Cricket Club (MCC), which {{was formed in}} 1838, only {{three years after the}} {{founding}} of Melbourne.

Swedish rivals Gunder Hägg and Arne Andersson broke each other's 1500m and mile world records {{on a number of}} occasions in the 1940s. The prominence of the distances were maintained by Roger Bannister, who (in 1954) was the first to run the long-elusive four-minute mile, and Jim Ryun's exploits served to popularise interval training. Races between British rivals Sebastian Coe, Steve Ovett and Steve Cram characterised middle-distance running in the 1980s. From the 1990s onwards, North Africans such as Noureddine Morceli of Algeria and Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco came to dominate the 1500 and mile events.|$|E
5|$|The next season, Bradman made an {{abortive}} bid to {{join the}} Victoria state side. The Melbourne Cricket Club advertised the position of club secretary and he was {{led to believe that}} if he applied, he would get the job. The position, which had been held by Hugh Trumble until his death in August 1938, was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>prestigious</b> jobs in Australian cricket. The annual salary of £1,000 would make Bradman financially secure while allowing him to retain a connection with the game. On 18 January 1939, the club's committee, on the casting vote of the chairman, chose former Test batsman Vernon Ransford over Bradman.|$|E

The courage demonstrated by the Chinese soldiers at Triangle Hill was repeatedly glorified in various forms of media, including several major motion pictures. Qin Jiwei was also celebrated as the hero of Shangganling and eventually rose to become the Minister of Defense and the Vice Chairman of the National People's Congress. The 15th Corps became one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>prestigious</b> units within the PLA, and the PLAAF selected the 15th Corps to become China's first airborne corps in 1961. It remains the most elite corps-size unit in China today.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, {{at the end}} of his five-year {{contract}} with the newspaper, Ponsford successfully applied for a position on the staff of the Melbourne Cricket Club. He was appointed to an unspecified office job working for the club secretary Hugh Trumble, which required him to transfer his cricket and baseball allegiances from St Kilda to Melbourne. The Herald unsuccessfully tried to retain his services, and Keith Murdoch—the Editor-in-Chief of the Herald, and later, the father of Rupert Murdoch—visited the Ponsford home to lobby against the move. Ponsford's new role included managing the staffing arrangements and crowd control at the Melbourne Cricket Ground for Australian rules football and cricket matches. In 1956, following the retirement of Vernon Ransford, Ponsford unsuccessfully applied for the position of club secretary, effectively its chief executive officer and one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>prestigious</b> positions in Australian cricket. However, in the event recently retired Test cricketer Ian Johnson was appointed to the position. Ponsford remained with the club until his retirement in June 1969.|$|E
5|$|In ecclesiastical architecture, a {{style with}} {{more in common}} to that in England was adopted. Important figures {{included}} Frederick Thomas Pilkington (1832–98), who developed a new style of church building which accorded with the fashionable High Gothic, but which adapted it for the worship needs of the Free Church of Scotland, as at Barclay Viewforth Church, Edinburgh (1862–64). Robert Rowand Anderson (1834–1921), who trained {{in the office of}} George Gilbert Scott in London before returning to Edinburgh, worked mainly on small churches in the 'First Pointed' (or Early English) style that is characteristic of Scott's former assistants. By 1880 his practice was designing some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>prestigious</b> public and private buildings in Scotland, such as the Scottish National Portrait Gallery; the Dome of Old College, Medical Faculty and McEwan Hall, Edinburgh University; the Central Hotel at Glasgow Central station, the Catholic Apostolic Church in Edinburgh and Mount Stuart House on the Isle of Bute.|$|E
