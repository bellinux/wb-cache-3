5|$|Operations {{management}}: At the <b>operational</b> <b>level</b> {{design management}} {{deals with the}} management of design projects. Processes and tools from operations management {{can be applied to}} design management in the execution of design projects.|$|E
5|$|Operational design {{management}} involves {{the management of}} individual design projects and design teams. Its goal is to achieve the objectives set by strategic {{design management}}. Success of good design management can be measured by {{evaluating the quality of}} operational design management outcomes. It includes the selection and management of design suppliers and encompasses the documentation, supervision, and evaluation of design processes and results. It deals with personal leadership, emotional intelligence, and the cooperation with and management of internal communications. Regular management functions, tools, and concepts can often be applied to the management of design on the <b>operational</b> <b>level.</b> It is implemented to achieve specific design objectives and manage the judgment of design proposals. It can help to build brand equity through the consistent creation and implementation of high-quality design solutions that best fit the brand identity and desired consumer experience, in the most efficient way. Depending on the type of company and industry, the following job titles are associated with this role: operational design manager, senior designer, team leader, visual communication manager, corporate design coordinator, and others.|$|E
5|$|Tactical design {{management}} addresses the organisation of design resources and design processes. Its {{goal is to}} create a structure for design in the company, bridging the gap between objectives set through strategic {{design management}} and the implementation of design on the <b>operational</b> <b>level.</b> It defines how design is organised within the company. This includes the use of a central body to coordinate different design projects and activities. It deals with defining activities, developing design skills and competencies, managing processes, systems and procedures, assigning of roles and responsibilities, developing innovative products and service concepts, and finding new market opportunities. Outcomes of tactical design management are related {{to the creation of a}} structure for design within the company, to build internal resources and competencies for the implementation of design. Depending on the type of company and industry, the following job titles are associated with this function: tactical design manager, design director, design & innovation manager, brand design manager, new product development (NPD) manager, visual identity manager, and others.|$|E

5|$|The law {{governing}} aviation in the UK {{is defined}} by the Civil Aviation Act 1982, which is updated periodically with amendments, the latest being the Civil Aviation Act 2006. The government department responsible for legislating changes in national policy and long term strategy relating to aviation is the Department for Transport (DfT). At the <b>operational</b> <b>level</b> the independently run Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) regulates economic, safety, and consumer protection aspects, as well as airspace policy, although these responsibilities are being increasingly ceded to the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). International aspects of air transport are regulated by agreements made within the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) as established by the Chicago Convention, whilst most new legislation is now made at the European level through the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC). As a consequence, other than in airport development, there are few aspects of the air transport industry in which the government can act in isolation.|$|E
25|$|In the Plan sub-process {{the goals}} {{formulated}} in the SLA are {{specified in the}} form of <b>operational</b> <b>level</b> agreements (OLA). These OLA’s can be defined as security plans for a specific internal organization entity of the service provider.|$|E

40|$|The {{dynamic and}} non-hierarchical {{nature of the}} {{military}} domain presents a challenge for traditional supply chain optimization. Flow networks and simulation techniques have been applied to the military distribution problem, but are unable to provide time-definite delivery to customers. Recently, optimization approaches have been independently applied towards strategic and <b>operational</b> <b>levels</b> of planning. However, decomposing military distribution into separate problems forces optimization techniques to utilize imprecise data. The size of the military distribution problem has prevented optimization techniques from providing end-to-end planning capabilities. This paper presents a Tabu Search algorithm for simultaneously solving strategic and <b>operational</b> <b>levels</b> of planning. The algorithm uses partial-order planning to separate the optimization process from the constraint verification process. The problem is reduced to a tractable computation by representing scenarios as two-tier systems and only permitting transshipments between different tiers. The results verify that the presented algorithm discovers higher quality solutions than simulation for simultaneously solving strategic and <b>operational</b> <b>levels</b> of planning...|$|R

25|$|In the 21st {{century the}} {{tendency}} to overcome Taylorism is very great. The trend is moving away from assembly line work, since people are increasingly being replaced by machines in production plants and sub-processes are automated, so that human labor is not necessary in these cases. The desire for automated workflow in companies is intended to reduce costs and support the company at the <b>operational</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E

25|$|The <b>operational</b> <b>level</b> {{agreements}} {{for information}} security {{are set up}} and implemented based on the ITIL process. This requires cooperation with other ITIL processes. For example, if security management wishes to change the IT infrastructure {{in order to enhance}} security, these changes will be done through the change management process. Security management delivers the input (Request for change) for this change. The Change Manager is responsible for the change management process.|$|E
25|$|The second way is for humans, individually, {{to pollute}} less. That {{requires}} {{social and political}} will, together with a shift in awareness so more people respect the environment and are less disposed to abuse it. At an <b>operational</b> <b>level,</b> regulations, and international government participation is needed. It is often very difficult to regulate marine pollution because pollution spreads over international barriers, thus making regulations hard to create as well as enforce.|$|E
25|$|Snowflake {{incurred}} {{the same}} overhead costs as Scandinavian; {{the lack of}} a clear separation between the airlines at an <b>operational</b> <b>level</b> meant that Snowflake never succeeded in lowering unit costs below that of Scandinavian Airlines. Finally, operating only four aircraft was too small a fleet to achieve the necessary economy of scale. With the ticket prices based on cost savings which never materialized, the airline failed to operate with a profit.|$|E
40|$|Animal disease {{epidemics}} {{such as the}} {{foot-and-mouth disease}} (FMD) pose recurrent threat to countries with intensive livestock production. Efficient FMD control is crucial in limiting the damage of FMD epidemics and securing food production. Decision making in FMD control involves a hierarchy of decisions made at strategic, tactical, and <b>operational</b> <b>levels.</b> These decisions are interdependent {{and have to be}} made under uncertainty about future development of the epidemic. Addressing this decision problem, this paper presents a new decision-support framework based on multi-level hierarchic Markov processes (MLHMP). The MLHMP model simultaneously optimizes decisions at strategic, tactical, and <b>operational</b> <b>levels,</b> using Bayesian forecasting methods to model uncertainty and learning about the epidemic. As illustrated by the example, the framework is especially useful in contingency planning for future FMD epidemic...|$|R
40|$|Today, most mining {{companies}} declare {{their commitment to}} the values of sustainability in their Vision, declarations and policies, but not many achieve an efficient integration of those values down into the <b>operational</b> <b>levels</b> of the organization. Corporate commitment is an essential condition for integrating sustainability, but is not sufficient. Another key condition is a business culture where sustainability is a high professional and business value and sustainability objectives are implemented through commitment rather than compliance. Furthermore, the integration process requires of an organizational structure specific roles and integration mechanisms and adequate management systems. In this paper, I would like to focus on the very complex management task for the integration of sustainability down to the <b>operational</b> <b>levels</b> of {{mining companies}}, the organizational structures and the management roles and systems required for integratio...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the interdependence between the <b>operational</b> planning <b>level</b> of development {{and the effectiveness of}} the production process. The <b>operational</b> planning <b>level</b> of development has been measured by the scale of six intensity levels (1 – 6) to evaluate each of the eight targeted tasks (planning raw and materials, work planning, planning tools and equipment, capacity planning, termination of production, scheduling by work centres, drafting and launching of work documentation and various records terms and performance), while the effectiveness of the production process has been measured by the following indicators: productivity, stock turnover rate, capacity utilisation rate, delivery time and fallout ratio. The results have shown that enterprises with higher <b>operational</b> planning <b>level</b> of development present better effectiveness of the production process in comparison to enterprises with less <b>operational</b> planning <b>level</b> of development...|$|R
25|$|The inputs are {{requirements}} from clients. The {{requirements are}} translated into security services and security metrics. Both {{the client and}} the plan sub-process affect the SLA. The SLA is an input for both the client and the process. The provider develops security plans for the organization. These plans contain policies and <b>operational</b> <b>level</b> agreements. The security plans (Plan) are then implemented (Do) and the implementation is then evaluated (Check). After the evaluation, the plans and the plan implementation are maintained (Act).|$|E
25|$|A {{multitude}} of different practical situations of good SSG exist according to development actors. For example, in a security sector lead by good governance, {{the use of}} force is defined by a legal framework. This subsequently requires, among others, that publicly transparent laws are in place; oversight and separation of powers mechanisms are established and working; and the state's legitimate use of force is regulated through strategies and policies. An <b>operational</b> <b>level</b> example would be improved interaction between the public and the security sector, including freedom of information and complaint institutes.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, criticisms {{have been}} made {{on the way the}} {{operation}} was led. According to Michael Kometer and Stephen Wright, the outcome of the Libyan intervention was reached by default rather than by design. It appears that there was an important lack of consistent political guidance caused particularly by the vagueness of the UN mandate and the ambiguous consensus among the NATO-led coalition. This lack of clear political guidance was translated into an incoherent military planning on the <b>operational</b> <b>level.</b> Such a gap may impact the future NATO's operations that will probably face trust issues.|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the process and outcome of defence reform under the Labour government, with a particular focus on the structuring of military input to defence planning. It argues that UK defence reform has been characterised by dynamism at the tactical and <b>operational</b> <b>levels</b> but that organisational politics between the services has impacted upon decisions surrounding defence capability procurement and force posture. The core executive {{has been able to}} structure military input to defence planning effectively at the tactical and <b>operational</b> <b>levels.</b> However, the core executive's capacity to provide clear guidance on the balance to be struck between capabilities and force postures relevant to contemporary and future conflict scenarios has been impeded by the British electoral cycle. Neo-classical realism provides, therefore, compelling analytical leverage in conceptualising British defence reform...|$|R

25|$|The {{maintenance}} sub-process {{starts with}} {{the maintenance of the}} service level agreements and the maintenance of the <b>operational</b> <b>level</b> agreements. After these activities take place (in no particular order) and there is a request for a change the request for change activity will take place and after the request for change activity is concluded the reporting activity starts. If there is no request for a change then the reporting activity will start directly after the first two activities. The concepts in the meta-data model are created/ adjusted during the maintenance phase. For a list of the concepts and their definition take a look at table 2.5.2.|$|E
25|$|The Luftwaffe's {{general picture}} of the VVS was entirely correct in many aspects in the {{military}} field; this was later confirmed {{in the early stages}} of Barbarossa and in post-war British and American studies, and also in the Eastern Bloc. Soviet sources confirm that the VVS was in a state of reorganisation before the attack, and were retraining on modern machines which made it unready for a major conflict. The deductions about Soviet tactical-operational limitations were to a large degree, accurate. In aircraft types, equipment and training, ground organisation, supply system at the <b>operational</b> <b>level,</b> the dispersal of effort and the operational commands immobility, gave the impression of an air force with limited striking power.|$|E
25|$|Marine Aviators {{deployed}} to the Middle East for Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, then to Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom. 2006 saw Marine Aviation {{at its highest}} <b>operational</b> <b>level</b> since the Vietnam War, flying more than 120,000 combat hours in to support operations in and near Afghanistan and Iraq. Despite their aging aircraft and high operating tempo, Marine Aviation maintained a 74.5-percent mission-capable rate, higher than the 62 percent of the USAF's F-22 Raptor. As of 2010, the aircraft fleet is undergoing another transformation. As of 2015, 19 percent of the fleet is inoperable, most of them CH-53s. The leader of Marine Aviation views this as too high, but expects to restore 30-40 aircraft per year.|$|E
