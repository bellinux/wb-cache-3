The crypt length in the jejunum was greater on rats fed the raw modified potato, although there was no statistical difference observed in the rats fed the cooked potato. As these effects were not observed in rats fed the control potatoes spiked with GNA, Pusztai concluded that the differences were a result of the transformation procedure, rather than the presence of GNA. Pusztai's collaborator Stanley Ewen said that the cauliflower mosaic virus used as a promoter could likely be the cause of the observed changes.|$|E

40|$|Unlike bovine {{cationic}} trypsin, rat anionic trypsin retains {{activity at}} high pH. This alkaline stability has {{been attributed to}} stabilization of the salt bridge between the N-terminal Ile 16 and Asp 194 by the surface negative charge (Soman K, Yang A-S, Honig B, Fletterick R., 1989, Biochemistry 28 : 9918 - 9926). The formation of this salt bridge controls the conformation of the activation domain in trypsin. In this work we probe the structure <b>of</b> <b>rat</b> trypsinogen {{to determine the effects of}} the surface negative charge on the activation domain in the absence of the Ile 16 -Asp 194 salt bridge. We determined the crystal structures <b>of</b> the <b>rat</b> trypsin-BPTI complex and the rat trypsinogen-BPTI complex at 1. 8 and 2. 2 A, respectively. The BPTI complex <b>of</b> <b>rat</b> trypsinogen resembles that <b>of</b> <b>rat</b> trypsin. Surprisingly, the side chain of Ile 16 is found in a similar position in both the rat trypsin and trypsinogen complexes, although it is not the N-terminal residue and cannot form the salt bridge in trypsinogen. The resulting position of the activation peptide alters the conformation of the adjacent autolysis loop (residues 142 - 153). While bovine trypsinogen and trypsin have similar CD spectra, the CD spectrum <b>of</b> <b>rat</b> trypsinogen has only 60 % of the intensity <b>of</b> <b>rat</b> trypsin. This lower intensity most likely results from increased flexibility around two conserved tryptophans, which are adjacent to the activation domain. The NMR spectrum <b>of</b> <b>rat</b> trypsinogen contains high field methyl signals as observed in bovine trypsinogen. It is concluded that the activation domain <b>of</b> <b>rat</b> trypsinogen is more flexible than that of bovine trypsinogen, but does not extend further into the protein core...|$|R

5|$|A line <b>of</b> <b>rats</b> with {{hereditary}} kidney cancer {{were developed}} by Japanese researchers. They have a mutation in the FLCN homolog that produces a truncated protein, though they do not develop the cutaneous or pulmonary symptoms seen in humans. Heterozygotes have renal abnormalities seen very early in life that develop into clear cell and hybrid tumors, significantly shortening the animals' lifespan; they also are prone to endometrial and salivary gland clear cell hyperplasia as well as rhabdomyolysis. Homozygotes do not survive to birth. When a wild-type FLCN gene was added, the phenotype was rescued.|$|E
5|$|Although this species' {{population}} {{now appears}} to be declining, the decrease is not rapid or large enough to trigger conservation vulnerability criteria. Given its high numbers, this petrel is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern. The perceived decline may be due increased predation from gulls, skuas and introduced mammals. Eradication <b>of</b> <b>rats</b> protects seabird colonies and may enable recolonisation of islands cleared of rodents. Predation of cave-nesting petrels in the Balearics by yellow-legged gulls is restricted to relatively few individual gulls specialising in this prey item; this means that the problems can be controlled by selective culling and the provision of plastic nest boxes.|$|E

5|$|In 1986, Richard Morris {{provided}} {{some of the}} first evidence that LTP was indeed required for the formation of memories in vivo. He tested the spatial memory <b>of</b> <b>rats</b> by pharmacologically modifying their hippocampus, a brain structure whose role in spatial learning is well established. Rats were trained on the Morris water maze, a spatial memory task in which rats swim in a pool of murky water until they locate the platform hidden beneath its surface. During this exercise, normal rats are expected to associate the location of the hidden platform with salient cues placed at specific positions around the circumference of the maze. After training, one group <b>of</b> <b>rats</b> had their hippocampi bathed in the NMDA receptor blocker APV, while the other group served as the control. Both groups were then subjected to the water maze spatial memory task. Rats in the control group were able to locate the platform and escape from the pool, while the performance of APV-treated rats was significantly impaired. Moreover, when slices of the hippocampus were taken from both groups, LTP was easily induced in controls, but could not be induced in the brains of APV-treated rats. This provided early evidence that the NMDA receptor — and by extension, LTP — was required for at least some types of learning and memory.|$|E

40|$|Urban rat infestations have multifactorial {{causes and}} {{may result in}} severe public health and {{environmental}} problems, as well as heavy economic losses. The identification of putative environmental determinants <b>of</b> urban <b>rat</b> infestations and the mapping of areas prone to experiencing such infestations (hot spots) are crucial for effectively addressing intervention efforts. We investigated the associations between a selection of environmental factors and the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>rat</b> infestations {{in the city of}} Madrid, Spain.

Although a better fit to the data was obtained in the model for the smaller scale and possibly more environmentally homogenous study area of Latina, modelling the spatial distribution <b>of</b> <b>rat</b> sightings was useful for identifying factors associated with an increased risk <b>of</b> urban <b>rat</b> infestations, as well as for identifying hot spots <b>of</b> <b>rat</b> activity, providing local authorities with a practical tool for effectively targeting intervention efforts to high-risk situations based on the local environmental contexts...|$|R
