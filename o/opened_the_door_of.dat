25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1991 First gulf war, Northern Iraq was declared by the coalition forces a safe haven and was placed under their protection. The Assyrian people returned to their destroyed communities and began overhauling them. But the long and hard process of reconstruction was difficult due to economic hardship and a lack of resources caused by endless years of wars and the economic embargo imposed on Iraq. International humanitarian organizations ultimately <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> mercy for help and reconstruction.|$|E
500|$|A {{few weeks}} later, John's wife Cynthia <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> Kenwood (their home in Weybridge) {{to see a}} man who [...] "looked like a tramp" [...] but, alarmingly, with John's face. Cynthia invited Alf in, and gave him tea and cheese on toast until John came home, which he was {{expected}} to do in an hour or so. While waiting, Cynthia offered to cut Alf's [...] "long, stringy locks" [...] of hair, which he allowed her to do. After waiting for a couple of hours, Alf left. John was annoyed when he came home, and told Cynthia (for the first time) about Alf's visit to the NEMS office a few weeks earlier. Later he relented slightly and contacted Alf over the next few months, telling Cynthia [...] "Alright, Cyn. He's a bit 'wacky', like me." [...] After Christmas, in 1965, John was embarrassed to hear that Alf had made a record: [...] "That's My Life (My Love and My Home)", released on 31 December 1965. John asked Epstein to do anything he could to stop it being released or becoming a hit. The record never made it into the charts. In 1966 [...] "Freddie Lennon" [...] (the name under which Alf recorded) tried again, and issued three singles with the group Loving Kind. These records did not sell well, either. Though the public at large quickly forgot these attempts to cash in on his son's success with the Beatles, the records do command fairly high prices among collectors of rare records, with [...] "That's My Life" [...] being worth over £50.|$|E

2500|$|Fifteen-year-old Whitley and 16-year-old Skaggs were {{discovered}} in Ft. Gay, West Virginia by Ralph Stanley who was 45 minutes late for a show due to a flat tire. Stanley <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> the club and heard what he thought were the Stanley Brothers playing on a jukebox. However it was Whitley and Skaggs, who [...] "sounded just like me and Carter in the early days". The two soon joined Ralph's band. Whitley became lead singer for Stanley in 1974. [...] Whitley also played with J.D. Crowe & the New South in the mid-1970s. During this period, he established himself {{as one of the}} most versatile and talented lead singers in bluegrass. His singing was heavily influenced by Carter Stanley and Lefty Frizzell. He moved to Nashville in 1983 to pursue a country music career and soon signed a record deal with RCA Records.|$|E
2500|$|Discussing Pete's demise, Gillian Taylforth {{who played}} his ex-wife Kathy Beale, {{has stated that}} {{although}} she and actor Peter Dean had problems [...] "now and then", she found it really hard when he left, and that Pete's death was [...] "an {{end of an era}} for EastEnders." [...] The tankard that Pete was often seen drinking from in pub scenes was allegedly so popular that Peter Dean reported it was stolen twice by fans and he had to replace it on both occasions. Dean has suggested that during his time in the soap, the most letters he received were about a storyline that saw him cross-dressing as part of a practical joke: [...] "The episode I got the most letters about was when Pete was going to a Topsy Turvy party, where men dress as women and women as men. But he didn't get the message that the party was cancelled. He <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> the Queen Vic in this dress, singing a song, and then it was the duff, duff, duff ... People felt so sorry for Pete about that." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1821 he {{finished}} a painting commissioned by a childhood friend, Monsieur de Pastoret, The Entry into Paris of the Dauphin, the Future Charles V; de Pastoret also ordered {{a portrait of}} himself and a religious work (Virgin with the Blue Veil). In August 1820, {{with the help of}} de Pastoret, he received a commission for a major religious painting for the Cathedral of Montauban. The theme was the re-establishment of the bond between the church and the state. Ingres's painting, The Vow of Louis XIII (1824), inspired by Raphael, was purely in the Renaissance style, and depicted King Louis XIII vowing to dedicate his reign to the Virgin Mary. This was perfectly in tune with the doctrine of the new government of the Restoration. He spent four years bringing the large canvas to completion, and he took it to the Paris Salon in October 1824, where it [...] became the key that finally <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> the Paris art establishment and to his career as an official painter.|$|E

2500|$|State Councilor Dai Bingguo {{said that}} China and the US {{launched}} the [...] "ping pong diplomacy" [...] 40 {{years ago and}} Dr. Henry Kissinger paid a secret visit to China. The aspiration of friendship between the Chinese and the US people and the determination and courage of politicians {{of the two countries}} converged into an irresistible historical trend and <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> China-US relations which had been closed for more than 20 years. Since then, there has been no force in the world capable of closing that door again. China-US relations stand at an equally critical historic moment at present. President Hu and President Obama, when meeting in Washington in January this year, agreed to establish and develop the cooperative partnership based on mutual respect and mutual benefit, pointing out the direction for the future development of bilateral ties. History is proving and will continue to prove that this critical decision with historical significance complies with the trend of history and will benefit the Chinese and the US people and the entire mankind.|$|E
