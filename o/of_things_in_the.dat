The Roman philosopher and atomist Lucretius (c. 99 – 55 BC) explicated these ideas in his poem De rerum natura (On the Nature <b>of</b> <b>Things).</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Epicurean system, {{it was assumed that}} many living forms had been spontaneously generated from Gaia in the past, but that only the most functional forms had survived to have offspring. The Epicureans did not anticipate the full theory of evolution as we now know it, but seem to have postulated separate abiogenetic events for each species.|$|E

25|$|Thought is {{a mental}} act that allows humans {{to make sense}} <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world, and to {{represent}} and interpret them {{in ways that are}} significant, or which accord with their needs, attachments, goals, commitments, plans, ends, desires, etc. Thinking involves the symbolic or semiotic mediation of ideas or data, as when we form concepts, engage in problem solving, reasoning, and making decisions. Words that refer to similar concepts and processes include deliberation, cognition, ideation, discourse and imagination.|$|E

25|$|The load a {{skyscraper}} experiences {{is largely}} from {{the force of the}} building material itself. In most building designs, the weight of the structure is much larger than the weight of the material that it will support beyond its own weight. In technical terms, the dead load, the load of the structure, is larger than the live load, the weight <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> structure (people, furniture, vehicles, etc.). As such, the amount of structural material required within the lower levels of a skyscraper will be much larger than the material required within higher levels. This is not always visually apparent. The Empire State Building's setbacks are actually a result of the building code at the time (1916 Zoning Resolution), and were not structurally required. On the other hand, John Hancock Center's shape is uniquely the result of how it supports loads. Vertical supports can come in several types, among which the most common for skyscrapers can be categorized as steel frames, concrete cores, tube within tube design, and shear walls.|$|E

Um, {{there were a couple}} <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I {{thought it was going to}} do well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E
25|$|While {{the term}} magical realism first {{appeared}} in 1955, the term Magischer Realismus, translated as magic realism, was first used by German art critic Franz Roh in 1925 {{to refer to a}} painterly style also known as Neue Sachlichkeit (the New Objectivity), an alternative to expressionism championed by fellow German museum director Gustav Hartlaub. Roh identified magic realism's accurate detail, smooth photographic clarity, and portrayal of the 'magical' nature of the rational world. It reflects the uncanniness of people and our modern technological environment. Roh believed that magic realism was related to, but distinct from, surrealism, due to magic realism's focus on the material object and the actual existence <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world, as opposed to surrealism's more cerebral, psychological and subconscious reality. Magic realism was later used to describe the uncanny realism by American painters such as Ivan Albright, Paul Cadmus, George Tooker and Viennese-born Henry Koerner, along other artists during the 1940s and 1950s. However, in contrast with its use in literature, magic realist art does not often include overtly fantastic or magical content, but rather looks at the mundane through a hyper-realistic and often mysterious lens.|$|E

25|$|The Zulu trouble, and disaffection brewing in the Transvaal, reacted {{upon each}} other most disastrously. The delay in giving {{the country a}} {{constitution}} afforded a pretext for agitation to the resentful Boers, a rapidly increasing minority, while the defeat at Isandlwana had badly tarnished {{the reputation of the}} British Empire in the region. Owing to the Xhosa and Zulu wars, Sir Bartle had been unable to give his undivided attention to the state <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Transvaal until April 1879, when he was at last able to visit a camp of about 4,000 disaffected Boers near Pretoria. Though conditions were grim, Frere managed to win the Boers' respect by promising to present their complaints to the British government, and to urge the fulfilment of the promises that had been made to them. The Boers did eventually disperse, on the very day upon which Frere received the telegram announcing the government's censure. On his return to Cape Town, he found that his achievement had been eclipsed—first by 1 June 1879 death of Napoleon Eugene, Prince Imperial in Zululand, and then by the news that the government of the Transvaal and Natal, together with the high commissionership {{in the eastern part of}} South Africa, had been transferred from him to Sir Garnet Wolseley. Meanwhile, growing Boer resentment at Frere's policies erupted in December 1880 into the disastrous First Boer War. The First Boer War, with the humiliating British defeats at Bronkhorstspruit, Laing's Nek, Schuinshoogte and Majuba Hill led to the independence of the Boer Republics and the final end of Carnarvon's confederation scheme.|$|E

500|$|Furst {{and the art}} {{department}} deliberately mixed clashing architectural {{styles to}} [...] "make Gotham City the ugliest and bleakest metropolis imaginable". Furst continued, [...] "e imagined what New York City might have become without a planning commission. A city run by crime, with a riot of architectural styles. An essay in ugliness. As if hell erupted through the pavement and kept on going". The 1985 film Brazil by Terry Gilliam was also a notable influence upon the film's production design, as both Burton and Furst studied it as a reference. Derek Meddings served as the visual effects supervisor, while Keith Short helped construct the newly created 1989 Batmobile, adding two Browning machine guns. On designing the Batmobile, Furst explained, [...] "We looked at jet aircraft components, we looked at war machines, we looked at all sorts <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> end, we went into pure expressionism, taking the Salt Flat Racers of the 30s and the Sting Ray macho machines of the 50s". The car was built upon a Chevrolet Impala when previous development with a Jaguar and Ford Mustang failed.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, the McNair and {{the band}} parted ways, with neither party giving a {{definitive}} rationale.

Nobody wants to hurt anyone, or to cut them out, but it was just like four adults getting a divorce, and their child is the band." [...] She has alternately explained that the split was due to the [...] "alternative lifestyles" [...] of McNair {{and the rest of the}} group and that McNair's musicianship was not as competent as the other members. The remaining trio recruited session drummer Josh Freese and engineers Sandy Solomon and Bernie Zwass to record a cover of Tom Waits' [...] "Christmas Card from a Hooker in Minneapolis" [...] at Plus Four Recordings Studios, in Sherman Oaks, California in June 1995 for the compilation album [...] Freese joined the group in November–December of that year in Los Angeles, California to record Rubbing Doesn't Help. Mould was unavailable, so the band relocated to Los Angeles and worked with producer Geza X at his home studio in attempt to make a more [...] "eclectic" [...] album that would represent the diversity of their songwriting. After hearing some demos, the band decided to hire him to produce the actual album and moved to Los Angeles for recording. The album produced the singles [...] "Open the Door" [...] and [...] "This Family" [...] (the former also had a music video), as well as the EP Fire All Your Guns at Once.

500|$|Recruiting animators for Toy Story was brisk; {{the magnet}} for talent {{was not the}} pay, {{generally}} mediocre, but rather the allure of {{taking part in the}} first computer-animated feature. Lasseter said that on the challenges of the computer animation in the film [...] "We had to make things look more organic. Every leaf and blade of grass had to be created. We had to give the world a sense of history. So the doors are banged up, the floors have scuffs." [...] The film began with animated storyboards to guide the animators in developing the characters. 27 animators worked on the film, using 400 computer models to animate the characters. Each character was either created out of clay or was first modeled off of a computer-drawn diagram before reaching the computer animated design. Once the animators had a model, articulation and motion controls were coded; this would allow each character to move in a variety of ways, such as talking, walking, or jumping. Out of all the characters, Woody was the most complex, as he required 723 motion controls, including 212 for his face and 58 for his mouth. The first piece of animation, a 30-second test, was delivered to Disney in June 1992, when the company requested a sample of what the film would look like. Lasseter wanted to impress Disney with a number <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> test that could not be done in traditional, hand-drawn animation, such as Woody's yellow plaid shirt with red stripes, the reflections in Buzz's helmet and the decals on his space suit, or Venetian blind shadows falling across Andy's room.|$|E

2500|$|Clarke's ethical {{theory of}} [...] "fitness" [...] is {{formulated}} on {{the analogy of}} mathematics.

The theory was criticized by Théodore Simon Jouffroy, Amédée Jacques, Sir James Mackintosh, Thomas Brown, Francis Hutcheson, and others, but substantially defended by John Balguy against Hutcheson's sentimentalist case against moral rationalism. A similar form of moral rationalism is developed by the Cambridge Platonist Ralph Cudworth.|$|E
