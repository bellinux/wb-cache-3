50|$|<b>Oxolinic</b> <b>acid</b> is a {{quinolone}} antibiotic {{developed in}} Japan in the 1970s. Dosages 12-20 mg/kg orally administered {{for five to}} ten days.

40|$|A {{target protein}} for nalidixic and <b>oxolinic</b> <b>acids</b> in Escherichia coli, the nalA gene product (Pnal), was {{purified}} to homogeneity as judged by gel electrophoresis, using an {{in vitro complementation}} assay. It is a dimer of identical 110, 000 -dalton subunits. A polypeptide of this molecular weight is uniquely induced by a λ nalA transducing phage, thereby showing that the purified Pnal {{is a product of}} the nalA gene. Nalidixic and <b>oxolinic</b> <b>acids</b> inhibit DNA gyrase activity and induce formation of a relaxation complex analogue. Treatment of the complex with sodium dodecyl sulfate causes a doublestrand break in the DNA substrate and the resulting linear molecule seems covalently bound to protein. Complex formation, unlike the introduction of supertwists, does not require ATP or relaxed circular DNA and is insensitive to novobiocin. DNA gyrase from a strain with a nalA mutation conferring drug resistance (nalAr) is 1 / 100 as sensitive to <b>oxolinic</b> and nalidixic <b>acids</b> with respect to inhibition of supertwisting and induction of the pre-linearization complex. Addition of Pnal restores drug sensitivity and stimulates DNA gyrase activity. DNA gyrase preparations and Pnal catalyze a third reaction sensitive to nalidixic and <b>oxolinic</b> <b>acids,</b> the ATP-independent relaxation of supertwister DNA. Relaxation by gyrase from nalAr cells is drug resistant. The nicking-closing activity is distinct from E. coli ω protein in several properties, including the ability to relax positively supertwisted DNA. We postulate that the nalA gene product occurs in two molecular forms, as Pnal and as a gyrase component. Both forms catalyze nicking-closing, and inhibition of this activity by nalidixic and <b>oxolinic</b> <b>acids</b> may account for the inhibition of DNA synthesis by these drugs...|$|R

50|$|Symptoms of {{bacterial}} panicle blight include seedling blighting and sheath rot {{in addition to}} panicle blighting, which accounts {{for most of the}} damage from this disease. Affected panicles have blighted florets, which initially show white or light gray on the basal third with a dark-brown margin and eventually become straw-colored. The florets then turn dark with growth of fungi or bacteria on the surface. Extensive occurrence of upright panicles because of the failure of grain-filling and seed development is a typical phenomenon observed in a severely infested field. Prolonged high temperature during the growing season is an important environmental condition that promotes the development {{of bacterial}} panicle blight. Severe epidemics of this disease, which caused up to 40 percent yield losses in some fields, occurred during the 1995, 1996, 1998, 2000 and, most recently, 2010 growing seasons, when record-high night temperatures were experienced. Suspected global warming could make bacterial panicle blight a greater threat to rice production in the future. Indeed, occurrence of bacterial panicle blight is increasing not only in the southern United States but in other rice growing countries of Central and South America and Asia.The disease cycle of bacterial panicle blight is not fully understood in spite of the economic importance of the disease.The bacterial pathogens are considered to be seed-borne, but they also survive in the soil. After germination of the seed, the bacteria appear to survive on the leaves and sheath and spread upward as the plant grows. Their infection to rice panicles occurs at flowering, if the bacterial population reaches to a threshold level and environmental condition is favorable. They may also be disseminated from severely diseased panicles to neighboring healthy plants, according to the observed spatial distribution patterns of the disease in infested rice fields. However, it is not clear if long-distance dissemination can occur via insect transmission.Unfortunately, there are few effective control measures for this disease so far.Less nitrogen fertilization reduces disease severity but has not been successful. High temperatures at the vulnerable period can be avoided by early planting, but this cultural practice would become useless if hot weather comes early in the growing season. No pesticides are currently recommended or allowed for controlling this disease in the United States. Copper compounds are weakly effective but sometimes toxic to the plant. <b>Oxolinic</b> <b>acid</b> is useful for seed treatment, and its foliar spray is effective on infected plants, but this chemical is not commercially available in the United States.The research goal on bacterial panicle blight is to develop effective disease control methods based on better understanding of the bacterial virulence mechanism and the rice defense system.To achieve this goal, LSU AgCenter scientists are conducting several different areas of research. First, scientists are making efforts to develop new rice varieties and lines resistant to bacterial panicle blight through conventional breeding and line development processes. More than 15,000 lines are evaluated annually to select promising lines showing high levels of disease resistance to bacterial panicle blight and other good agronomic traits. The partial-resistant rice varieties and lines, such as Jupiter and LM-1, were developed from this program. Second, scientists are conducting genetic and molecular biological studies on the rice disease resistance to bacterial panicle blight. Genetic mapping to identify the rice genes associated with the disease resistance is under way. In addition, the induction of a rice defense system by pretreatment of various chemical materials, which leads to enhanced disease resistance, is being studied. Finally, scientists are studying molecular genetics and genomics of the major pathogen, B. glumae, to understand the mechanism underlying its bacterial pathogenesis in rice.Genetic elements governing the production of virulence factors are being identified and characterized.|$|E

This difference was more pronounced with nali-dixic acid and was most marked when tested in liquid medium. The results of a controlled clinical trial in 54 patients demonstrated that treatment with 2 g/day <b>oxolinic</b> <b>acid</b> was associated with less emergence of resistance during therapy than was the case with 4 g/day nalidixic acid. Although the relative role of these agents in the treatment of chronic bacteriuria remains uncertain, it ap-pears that <b>oxolinic</b> <b>acid,</b> because of its decreased tendency to evoke highly resistant mutants, has distinct potential advantages over nalidixic acid.

40|$|Miloxacin, a {{synthetic}} antibacterial agent structurally related to <b>oxolinic</b> <b>acid,</b> has {{a broad spectrum}} of activity in vitro against gram-negative bacteria and considerable activity in vivo against infections with these bacteria. These observations led to studies on the absorption and excretion of miloxacin in mice, rats, and dogs after administration of a single oral dose. Studies on <b>oxolinic</b> <b>acid</b> have been included for comparison. Peak serum levels of miloxacin, attained 1 h after administration of 20, 50, and 100 mg/kg to rats and dogs, were approximately 20, 40, and 60 micrograms/ml, respectively. Peak levels in mice receiving the same dose were 15, 60, and 80 micrograms/ml at 0. 5 h. Peak serum levels of <b>oxolinic</b> <b>acid</b> were attained 0. 5 to 1 h later than the above times at comparable doses and were one-half to one-fourth those of miloxacin. Urinary recovery of miloxacin at the above doses ranged from 3. 2 to 6. 5 % during the 24 -h posttreatment period. Recoveries of <b>oxolinic</b> <b>acid</b> were one-half to one-fifth those of miloxacin. At a 50 -mg/kg dose, rats excreted 4. 6 % of the miloxacin in bile in the 20 -h posttreatment period...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to determine the efficacy of orally administered <b>oxolinic</b> <b>acid</b> and Vetoquinol, an <b>oxolinic</b> <b>acid</b> ester, {{in the treatment of}} experimental induced furunculosis in Atlantic salmon Salmo salar held in seawater. Two strains of the causative bacterium Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida, 1 sensitive (VI- 88 / 09 / 03175) and 1 resistant (3475 / 90) to <b>oxolinic</b> <b>acid,</b> were used. In 2 trials, cohabitational challenges were performed by introducing 8 fish challenged in advance by an intraperitoneal injection of 2. 2 x 10 (4) colony forming units of strain 3475 / 90 (Trial 1) or strain VI- 88 / 09 / 03175 (Trial 2) to 10 aquaria each containing 40 healthy fish. The treatment groups in both trials consisted of 4 groups receiving either <b>oxolinic</b> <b>acid</b> (2 groups) or Vetoquinol (2 groups) and 1 control group. An unchallenged, unmedicated group was used to determine the natural mortality in the population. The recommended therapeutic dose of 25 mg <b>oxolinic</b> <b>acid</b> kg(- 1) fish at Days 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 following initiation of treatment was used. Oral medication initiated at Day 10 (Trial 1) or Day 11 (Trial 2) following challenge significantly (p < 0. 05) lowered the specific mortality in all drug-treated groups compared to the untreated control groups. Mortality in Vetoquinol-treated groups was significantly (p < 0. 05) lower than in oxolinic acid-treated groups in Trial 1 whereas no significant (p < 0. 05) difference in survival rate was found between the medicated groups in Trial 2...|$|E

40|$|Treatment of {{bacterial}} cells with inhibitors of gyrase at high concentration leads to relaxation of DNA supercoils, presumably through {{interference with the}} supercoiling activity of gyrase. Under certain conditions, however, the inhibitors can also increase supercoiling. In the case of coumermycin A 1, this increase occurs at low drug concentrations. <b>Oxolinic</b> <b>acid</b> increases supercoiling in a partially resistant mutant. We found that increases in chromosomal DNA supercoiling, which were blocked by treatment with chloramphenicol, were accompanied by an increased expression rate of gyrA. This result is consistent with gyrase being responsible for the increase in supercoiling. In wild-type cells, increases in gyrA expression were transient, suggesting that when supercoiling reaches sufficiently high levels, gyrase expression declines. <b>Oxolinic</b> <b>acid</b> {{studies carried out with}} a delta topA strain showed that drug treatment also increased plasmid supercoiling. The levels of supercoiling and topoisomer heterogeneity were much higher when the plasmid contained one of several promoters fused to galK. Since <b>oxolinic</b> <b>acid</b> causes an increase in gyrA expression, it appears that gyrase levels may be important in transcription-mediated changes in supercoiling even when topoisomerase I is absent...|$|E
40|$|A {{microbiological}} assay {{was developed}} to quantify the concentrations of the quinolone antibiotics sarafloxacin and <b>oxolinic</b> <b>acid</b> in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) plasma. The assay was a modification of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) method for antibiotic concentrations in feeds using disk diffusion and a lawn of Vibrio anguillarum ATCC 19264 as the test organism. With these modifications, sensitivities of 0. 04 microgram/mL for sarafloxacin and 0. 125 micrograms/mL for <b>oxolinic</b> <b>acid</b> were obtained.

40|$|A {{comparison}} between a microbiological assay and HPLC {{for the detection}} of enrofloxacin, <b>oxolinic</b> <b>acid</b> and flumequine residues in salmon muscle was studied. The limit of detection of the microbiological assay for enrofloxacin, <b>oxolinic</b> <b>acid</b> and flumequine was 10, 40 and 300 ppb, respectively and HPLC was 5 ppb for all the drugs studied. These sensitivities were lower than those described previously. The main difference for the microbiological assay and HPLC could relate to the indicator organism concentration and the aliquot injected, respectively. The results suggest that the microbiological assay could be used as screening with a confirmatory method by HPLC within a residue monitoring program for these drugs...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 30 {{isolates}} of Francisella noatunensis subsp. noatunensis isolated from Atlantic cod Gadus morhua L. were tested for susceptibility, {{in the form}} of minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values, against the following antibacterial agents: flumequine, <b>oxolinic</b> <b>acid,</b> ciprofloxacin, florfenicol, oxytetracycline, erythromycin, streptomycin sulphate, trimetoprim/ sulphadiazine and rifampin.
