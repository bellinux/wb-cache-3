5|$|Historical {{accuracy}} {{was important}} to many British designers, resulting in the use <b>of</b> <b>genuine</b> military equipment as models for memorials, and long discussions with committees over the details to be incorporated into designs.

5|$|In the Second World War, Great Britain granted conscientious-objection status {{not just}} to {{complete}} pacifists, but to those who objected to fighting in that particular war; this was done partly out <b>of</b> <b>genuine</b> respect, but also to avoid the disgraceful and futile persecutions of conscientious objectors {{that occurred during the}} First World War.|$|E
5|$|Frank Spedding, {{celebrated for}} his {{development}} of the ion-exchange technology that revolutionized the rare-earth industry in the mid-1950s, once related {{the story of how}} he was lecturing on the rare earths in the 1930s, when an elderly gentleman approached him with an offer of a gift of several pounds of europium oxide. This was an unheard-of quantity at the time, and Spedding did not take the man seriously. However, a package duly arrived in the mail, containing several pounds <b>of</b> <b>genuine</b> europium oxide. The elderly gentleman {{had turned out to be}} Herbert Newby McCoy, who had developed a famous method of europium purification involving redox chemistry.|$|E

5|$|Myers {{worked at}} Mohawk Valley Bank for six years. During {{this time he}} {{developed}} an interest in counterfeit money. He collected counterfeit bills and assembled a scrapbook of these for study. He then had another book <b>of</b> <b>genuine</b> bills; he then compared the two to learn the counterfeiters' techniques. He became an expert in detecting counterfeit bills. This became a valued interest to the bankers and Myers was given all the bank notes to pass through him for approval of genuineness. This ultimately became {{a basis for the}} present day method of detecting counterfeit bills.|$|E
5|$|Recordings of the French {{version for}} tenor are still {{relatively}} rare {{due to a}} lack <b>of</b> <b>genuine</b> haute-contres: there is one from the mid-1950s starring Léopold Simoneau opposite his wife Pierrette Alarie, and Nicolai Gedda also recorded the role in 1955. (Simoneau's version has been available on CD, although not at present, but Gedda's recording had its premiere CD release in 2009.) In 2002 haute-contre Jean-Paul Fouchécourt added his version, while Marc Minkowski brought out a period instrument performance with Richard Croft in the title role in 2004. In April 2010, a concert performance recorded in Madrid two years earlier by tenore di grazia Juan Diego Flórez, was finally released. There is also a DVD of the 1993 Australian Opera production, directed by Stefanos Lazaridis, with Australian haute-contre David Hobson as Orphée.|$|E
5|$|The film faced similar {{censorship}} {{problems for}} its theatrical release in the United Kingdom, {{where it was}} released as Zumbalah. In 1976, nearly 10 minutes were cut before it was passed with an X-rating by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC). Various scenes of animal cruelty, a race between cheetahs and ostriches, the lion attack, and the mercenaries' hunt of Amazonian natives were all cut from the British release. The scenes of animal cruelty were targeted by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) to be cut from the film, specifically the hunt and disembowelment of a puma. Also in 1976, the Valtion elokuvatarkastamo, the Finnish film classification board, banned the film in Finland in its entirety {{for the inclusion of}} scenes <b>of</b> <b>genuine</b> human death.|$|E

5|$|The treaty {{recognised}} Scotland as {{an independent}} kingdom. It stipulated that Robert was to pay 40,000 marks to the English, and that Edward {{should be allowed to}} choose a wife from his own family for Robert's heir. Implied in the text, however, was an alliance between Robert and Harclay to use force against Edward, if necessary, to implement the terms of the treaty. It seems unlikely that Harclay expected royal clemency for his actions. More likely he contemplated a defection to the side of Robert the Bruce; rumour had it he even planned marrying one of Bruce's daughters. It is nevertheless likely that his action grew out <b>of</b> <b>genuine</b> concern with the northern situation, and was a desperate attempt to make the best out of a difficult situation.|$|E
5|$|Castelli {{set up his}} {{government}} in Chuquisaca, where he presided over the change of regime for the entire region. He planned the reorganization of the Mines of Potosi, and a reform at the University of Charcas. He proclaimed the end of native slavery and servitude in Upper Peru, and the natives were granted political rights equal {{to those of the}} criollos. Castelli forbade the establishment of new convents and parishes to avoid the common practice that, under the guise of spreading Christian doctrine, the natives were forced into servitude by religious orders. He authorized free trade and redistributed land expropriated from the former workers of the mills. The decree was published in Spanish, Guarani, Quechua, and Aymara; he established several bilingual schools as well. Several Indian chiefs participated in {{the first anniversary of the}} May Revolution, celebrated in Tiahuanaco, where Castelli paid tribute to the ancient Incas and encouraged the people to rise against the Spanish. Despite their welcome, however, Castelli was aware that most of the aristocracy supported the auxiliary army out of fear instead <b>of</b> <b>genuine</b> support.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1976, while Vietnam and Kampuchea {{publicly}} {{appeared to}} be improving their relationships, the private suspicions of both countries' leadership grew. From the Vietnamese perspective, they were the patron <b>of</b> <b>genuine</b> Marxist–Leninist revolutions in South East Asia, so it was vital for them to exercise control over the Kampucheans and the Laotians. Indeed, {{that was the reason}} North Vietnam supported the Khmer Rouge during their fight against the Lon Nol regime, {{in the hope that the}} Kampuchean communists would adopt a pro-Vietnamese line upon their victory in the same way the Pathet Lao had done. However, their hopes were dashed as early as 1973, because North Vietnamese military formations operating in Khmer Rouge-occupied territories were occasionally subjected to armed attacks by their own allies. The Vietnamese position inside Kampuchea was further weakened after the end of the war, as there were no pro-Vietnamese elements left within the Kampuchean Communist Party.|$|E

5|$|The {{information}} that Ganteaume gleaned from his captive was largely false. A large expeditionary force and fleet under Lord Keith {{was in the}} Mediterranean but would not arrive in Egypt {{for more than two}} weeks, British landings eventually going ahead on 8 March. At the time Ganteaume questioned Peard, the force was anchored at Karamania on the southern coast of Anatolia, struggling with reluctant Ottoman allies and bad weather. In addition, there was little active pursuit of his squadron during February: when Concorde reached Plymouth on 3 February, urgent messages were sent to Earl St Vincent at the Admiralty who ordered the despatch of a fast squadron of six ships of the line, two frigates and a brig in search of Ganteaume's ships. However, attached to command this force was Rear-Admiral Sir Robert Calder, who traveled in a slow second rate ship of the line that significantly delayed the passage of his squadron. In any case, a miscalculation of Ganteaume's intentions at the Admiralty resulted in orders for Calder's squadron to sail to the West Indies, and they played no further part in the campaign. Warren, whose squadron was based off Cádiz, had learned of Ganteaume's passage on 8 February and sailed to Gibraltar in pursuit before continuing to Menorca on 13 February, arriving on 20 February without seeing any sign of the French and subsequently sailing for Sicily in March after hearing news of the impending Treaty of Florence between France and the Kingdom of Naples. Despite the lack <b>of</b> <b>genuine</b> pursuit, Ganteaume was unnerved by the information gleaned from Peard, and ordered the squadron to sail for Toulon, arriving on 19 February without any further contact with the Royal Navy.|$|E
