She fourth at the Australian Open, Venus retired {{in the second game}} of her third round match against Andrea Petkovic after sustaining a hip muscle injury in her second round. This was Williams's first retirement during a match in a Grand Slam tournament since 1994 and thus ended her record of most Grand Slam matches without ever retiring, with 250 consecutive matches. This was also her first retirement from a match since LA Women's Tennis Championships in Los Angeles in 2004, ending her 294 consecutive matches without retiring. The injury forced Williams to pull out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fed</b> Cup quarterfinal against Belgium, the Dubai Tennis Championships, and the Mexican Open, where she was the two-time defending champion in both tournaments. She subsequently withdrew from the Miami Open causing her ranking to drop to number fifteen. She also missed the clay court season which caused her ranking to drop to number twenty-nine. Her absence from the French Open marked the first Grand Slam tournament since the 2003 US Open where neither of the Williams sisters were competing.|$|E

500|$|The Federal Reserve began operations... as a {{peculiar}} hybrid, a partly public, partly private institution, {{intended to be}} independent of political influence with principal officers of the government on its supervisory board, endowed with central banking functions, but not a central bank. [...] Each of the twelve semiautonomous reserve banks set its own discount rates, subject to {{the approval of the}} Federal Reserve Board in Washington, made its own policy decisions, and set its own standards for what was eligible for discounting.Reflecting this intellectual heritage, Meltzer emphasizes (in common with Friedman and Schwartz in their Monetary History of the United States) the influence on the founders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fed</b> of: (i) the assumption, which was to prove unfounded, that the gold standard would continue to prevail, and (ii) the then widely held (and now discredited) real bills doctrine, which advocated restricting central bank credit to the discounting of commercial paper.

[...] These were among the questions eventually addressed in the Banking Act of 1935, which made major changes to the 1913 framework, mainly in the direction of centralizing authority in the Board {{at the expense of the}} regional Federal Reserve Banks. [...] The 1935 Act also weakened the legislative mandate for the Fed to follow the dictates of the real bills doctrine (Meltzer, Chapter 6).|$|E

This paper discusses <b>the</b> roots <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fed's</b> current credibility: a systematic approach to controlling inflation, transparency of its policy decisions, and timely communication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decisions and the considerations upon which they are based. The paper also discusses areas in which there is room for further improvement. It argues that the most important future step would be to adopt specific inflation targets.
