[...] "Fortunately, the sequence was carefully choreographed beforehand. We worked out all the moves by rehearsing in a little studio.

Then radio stations carried announcements inviting people to take part in 'a John Hughes movie'. The word got around fast and 10,000 people showed up!

500|$|The New York Times {{film critic}} Bosley Crowther noted {{the film was}} a subtle satire on Beatlemania and the Beatles themselves. The Beatles are portrayed as likeable young lads who are {{constantly}} amazed at the attention they receive and who want {{nothing more than a}} little peace and quiet; however, {{they have to deal with}} screaming crowds, journalists who ask nonsensical questions, and authority figures who constantly look down upon them. In fact their biggest problem is McCartney's elderly, but [...] "clean" [...] grandfather, played by Wilfrid Brambell. The New Yorker critic Brendan Gill wrote: [...] "Though I don't pretend to understand what makes these four rather odd-looking boys so fascinating to so many scores of millions <b>of</b> <b>people,</b> <b>I</b> admit that I feel a certain mindless joy stealing over me as they caper about uttering sounds." ...|$|E

500|$|For {{the match}} against Crystal Palace on 14 February 2005, Wenger named an Arsenal squad {{that did not}} feature a single British player – a first in the club’s history. The team did not get off {{to the best of}} starts with Lehmann miskicking a back pass and Vieira losing {{possession}} routinely, but grew as the game went on and scored three goals in seven minutes. On his 200th league appearance, Henry scored in either half, with the result 5–1 to Arsenal. The result was somewhat overshadowed by the foreign makeup of the team; former player Paul Merson called it a [...] "joke" [...] and PFA chairman Gordon Taylor noted it was a [...] "worrying pattern for English football".

Prior to the performing the song, Beyoncé met with United Nations leader Ban Ki-moon. Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations Jan Eliasson, announced Beyoncé's performance giving a short introduction about the singer: [...] "Tonight [...] brings more than her stunning talents; she brings inspiration to help another person, to help another human being". He further recalled a [...] "dark day {{in the history of}} the U.N." [...] when 22 humanitarian workers lost their lives in a terrorist attack in Iraq on August 19, 2003 adding that the event and the World Humanitarian Day both honor those lost lives and encourage others to join the effort. He further interviewed guests whose relatives lost their lives in the accident. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Valerie Amos also appeared encouraging everyone to log on to the website WHD-IWasHere.org by August 19 and commit to doing one good act to help someone in need further saying, [...] "I told Beyoncé: It's great that we have her, because she can reach millions <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> <b>I</b> could spend the rest of my life doing what I do, and I wouldn't reach a 10th of that number.

500|$|Speculation resumed, however, when Dean Morgan {{returned}} to the show {{for a second time}} in its fifth season. Cast member James Pickens, Jr. announced that both Heigl and T.R. Knight were set to depart from the show, but he later retracted his comment. During the course of the fifth season, Izzie was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma (Stage IV) which spread to her liver, skin and brain. Following the show's one-hundredth episode wrap party, Heigl revealed she did not know if Izzie would survive, as no one on the production team would disclose her character's fate to her. It was confirmed in June 2009 that Heigl would return as Izzie for the show's sixth season. Heigl's appearances in the season were sporadic, seeing Izzie depart and return twice. Although she was scheduled to appear in the final five episodes of the season, Heigl requested that she be released from her contract 18months early, and made her final appearance on January 21, 2010. Heigl explained that she wanted {{to spend more time with}} her family, and did not think it would be respectful to Grey's Anatomy viewers to have Izzie return and depart yet again. Michael Ausiello spoke further on Katherine Heigl's perspective on Izzie's departure. He said, [...] " [...] thinks her Jan. 21 farewell - while not originally intended to be her last episode - oddly works as a bookend to Izzie's story.

500|$|The {{episode was}} criticized for its {{portrayal}} of people who identify as transgender, particularly regarding the way Ida was treated by other characters. Food that Ida prepared for the dinner party at the Griffin house was thrown out and Brian's learning of her sex-reassignment surgery after {{he had sex with}} her caused him to [...] "violently" [...] vomit for 30 unbroken seconds. Speaking with LGBT media website AfterElton.com in January 2010, series creator Seth MacFarlane mentioned the episode in response to concerns over how his animated series have portrayed LGBT characters. [...] "It always distresses me when I hear that the gay community is upset with us, because that's one group <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>I</b> hope would know we're on their side. I can safely say that the transsexual community will be very, very happy with the 'Quagmire' episode that we have coming up in a couple of months. It's probably the most sympathetic portrayal of a transexual [...] character that has ever been on television, dare I say." [...] In a subsequent review, AfterElton.com writer Brent Hartinger graded the episode negatively. While noting that the episode deserves credit for making important points about transgender people, he found its inclusion of the vomiting scene and Lois and Peter's transphobic remarks about Ida to be [...] "shockingly insensitive". Hartinger continued, [...] "Frankly, it's literally impossible for me to reconcile last night's episode with MacFarlane's words, unless I {{come to the conclusion that}} the man is pretty much a complete idiot." [...] The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, an LGBT media watchdog organization, released a statement about the episode, noting that [...] "GLAAD shares the serious concerns being voiced from members of the community and GLAAD’s Entertainment Media Team is addressing these with Fox. Next steps will be decided at that point." [...] In a September 2010 interview in Details, MacFarlane expressed surprise at the negative reaction, stating [...] "I don't meet a lot of stupid homosexuals." [...] He repeated that he still felt Ida was a [...] "very sympathetic portrayal of a transsexual character". He also defended Brian's vomiting after discovering he had sex with someone who had undergone sex reassignment surgery noting Brian's character is heterosexual and [...] "If I found out that I had slept with a transsexual, I might throw up in the same way that a gay guy looks at a vagina and goes, 'Oh, my God, that's disgusting.'" [...] Eames (Digital Spy) believed the episode was [...] "surprisingly kind" [...] to the transgender community for [...] "Family Guy standards".|$|E

2500|$|American Gothic is a {{painting}} by Grant Wood {{in the collection of}} the Art Institute of Chicago.

[...] He painted it in 1930, depicting a farmer standing beside a woman who has been interpreted to be his daughter or his wife. The figures were modeled by Wood's sister Nan Wood Graham and their dentist Dr. Byron McKeeby. The woman is dressed in a colonial print apron evoking 19th-century Americana, and the man is holding a pitchfork. The plants on the porch of the house are mother-in-law's tongue and beefsteak begonia, which are the same as the plants in Wood's 1929 portrait of his mother Woman with Plants.|$|E
