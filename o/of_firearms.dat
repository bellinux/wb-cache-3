5|$|The Chamber of Deputies (1) expresses disapproval {{with the}} European Commission {{proposal}} {{to limit the}} possibility of acquisition and possession <b>of</b> <b>firearms</b> that are held legally in line with national laws of EU Member States, (2) refuses European Commission's infringement into a well established system of control, evidence, acquisition and possession <b>of</b> <b>firearms</b> and ammunition laid down by the Czech law, (3) expresses support for establishment of any and all functional measures to combat illegal trade, acquisition, possession and other illegal manipulation with firearms, ammunition and explosives, (4) refuses European Commission's persecution of Member States and their citizens through unjustified tightening of legal firearms possession {{as a reaction to}} terror attacks in Paris and (5) recommends the Prime Minister to conduct any and all legal and diplomatic steps to prevent enactment of a directive that would disrupt the Czech legal order in the area of trade, control, acquisition and possession <b>of</b> <b>firearms</b> and thus inappropriately infringe into the rights of the citizens of the Czech Republic.|$|E

5|$|Under {{common law}} tradition, civilians could possess {{firearms}} except artillery and insidious weapons (e.g. firearms that had appearance of other objects, etc.). First gun control laws were enacted during early 18th century {{and dealt with}} illegal use <b>of</b> <b>firearms</b> for poaching. At the time, hunting was an exclusive noble privilige with little to no legal option for participation of common folk. Despite tough sentences of 12 years of hard labor or death introduced by a 1727 enactment, poaching with use <b>of</b> <b>firearms</b> remained widespread {{to the point that}} a 1732 Royal Gamekeeping Rules noted that gamekeepers were in constant danger of being shot by poachers.|$|E
5000|$|The maximum {{permitted}} {{capacity of}} a magazine {{is determined by the}} kind <b>of</b> <b>firearm</b> it is designed or manufactured for and not the kind <b>of</b> <b>firearm</b> that might actually use it. As a consequence, the maximum permitted capacity remains the same regardless <b>of</b> which <b>firearm</b> it might be used in. Example: The Marlin Camp Carbine chambered for [...]45 ACP uses magazines designed and manufactured for the M1911 pistol, therefore the seven- and eight-round capacities are permitted. A similar example is the 10-round capacity magazine for the Rock River Arms LAR-15 pistol, regardless of the kind <b>of</b> <b>firearm</b> it is actually used in.|$|R

5|$|Articles 41 and 68 of the {{constitution}} empower the sovereign to withhold royal assent from bills adopted by the Legislative Assembly. In 2010, the kingdom moved towards greater democracy, with King George Tupou V saying {{that he would be}} guided by his prime minister in the exercising of his powers. Nonetheless, this does not preclude an independent royal decision to exercise a right of veto. In November 2011, the assembly adopted an Arms and Ammunitions (Amendment) Bill, which reduced the possible criminal sentences for the illicit possession <b>of</b> <b>firearms.</b> The bill was adopted by ten votes to eight. Two members of the assembly had recently been charged with the illicit possession <b>of</b> <b>firearms.</b> The Prime Minister, Lord Tuʻivakanō, voted in favour of the amendment. Members of the opposition denounced the bill and asked the King to veto it, which he did in December.|$|E
5|$|Because of titanium's {{superior}} {{strength and}} light weight {{relative to other}} metals (steel, stainless steel, and aluminium), and because of recent advances in metalworking techniques, its use has become more widespread in the manufacture <b>of</b> <b>firearms.</b> Primary uses include pistol frames and revolver cylinders.

5|$|Risk to {{defensive}} capabilities: Security {{forces are}} not changing armaments annually, and thus small arms manufacturers need civilians as key customers. Crippling of civilian firearms market would likely lead to end <b>of</b> <b>firearms</b> manufacturing in the Czech Republic. At the same time, familiarity with semi-automatic versions of army rifles by civilians {{is a clear}} defensive advantage in case these {{people need to be}} drafted to defend the country.|$|E
5|$|A story-driven game {{set in the}} 1960s, No One Lives Forever {{has been}} {{critically}} acclaimed for, among other things, its stylistic representation of the era {{in the spirit of}} many spy films and television series of that decade, as well as for its humor.

5|$|As {{animals at}} {{the summit of the}} food chain, bears do not have many predators.

5|$|Sometimes {{referred}} to as the Brady bill loophole, the Brady law loophole, the gun law loophole, or the private sale loophole, the term refers to a perceived gap in laws that address what types of sales and transfers <b>of</b> <b>firearms</b> require records and or background checks, such as the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. Private-parties are not legally required by federal law to: ask for identification, complete any forms, or keep any sales records, as long as the sale does not cross state lines and does not fall under purview of the National Firearms Act. In addition to federal legislation, firearm laws vary by state.|$|E

5|$|As Strike Back is a {{military}} drama, the production crew used a vast catalogue <b>of</b> <b>firearms,</b> including side arms, assault and sniper rifles, as well as rocket-propelled grenades, hand grenades and other explosives.

Later, they were taught how to carry them professionally, including how to disassemble and re-assemble them, as well as how to fire and reload. Though the majority were actually rubber, duplicates were sometimes used for some of the background characters. Three ex-SAS soldiers gave the cast weapons and tactical training, and were also on hand to oversee how cast members carried the weapons during filming sessions.|$|E
