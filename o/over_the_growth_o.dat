40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} the anti-cancer {{properties of the}} methanol extract of Piper crocatum Ruiz & Pav. leaves and {{its mode of action}} in human breast cancer (T 47 D) cells. Methods: The anti-cancer property and mechanism of action of the extract were evaluated by its effect on cell viability, nuclear morphology, cell cycle progression and the expression of phosphorylated p 44 /p 42 as a marker for cell proliferation. Results: The results showed that there was a reduction of cell viability by the extract in a concentration-dependent manner and no alteration of nuclear morphology was observed. There were negligible changes in Sub-G 1 phase formation after extract treatment. Expression of phosphorylated p 44 / 42 was decreased by the extract only. Inclusion of the extract in the incubation medium decreased insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of p 44 /p 42 indicating that the anti-proliferative effect of the extract was via p 44 /p 42 pathway.

Turbu-lence originates in the "inner wake " formed by the coalescence of the free shear layers (or annulus) shed from the body surface when the boundary layer separates from the surface. As this turbulence spreads outward, it swallows enthalpy or momentum defect originally coitained in the outer inviscid wake. If the turbulence is "locally similar", i. e., if it behaves at each station like a slice of a low speed "self-similar " wake, then the turbulent diffusivity grows from a low initial value near the body to a value corresponding to the total drag of the body at about 300 body diameters downstream.

40|$|SUMMARY: A medium {{containing}} propamidine {{is described}} which has high selective activity for the species Bacillus anthracis. The spore {{form of the}} organism is essential as inoculum for the medium. The isolation of Bacillus anthracis from material heavily contaminated by other organisms of the same genus can be difficult, particularly when small numbers of B. anthracis are present, or when quantitative examination is required. Pearce & Powell (1951) did much to simplify this problem by devising a medium containing lysozyme and haemin, but considerable numbers of other sporing organisms found in soil were not suppressed. The antibacterial activity of diamidines has been studied by many workers (e. g. Bernheim, 1943; Elson, 1945; Wein, Harrison & Freeman, 1948). Lacey (1954) used 4 : 4 -diamidino-phenylamine as a selective agent for Haemophilus pertussis.
