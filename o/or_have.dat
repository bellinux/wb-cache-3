5|$|A {{large number}} of species of {{families}} Saturniidae, Limacodidae and Megalopygidae have stinging caterpillars which have poisonous setae, also called urticating hairs, {{and in the case}} of Lonomia – a Brazilian saturniid genus – can kill a human due to its potent anticoagulant poison. Caterpillars of many taxa that have sequestered toxic chemicals from host plants <b>or</b> <b>have</b> sharp urticating hair or spines, display aposematic colouration and markings.|$|E
5|$|A single large {{opening on}} either side of the back of the skull links Dimetrodon with mammals and distinguishes it from most of the {{earliest}} sauropsids, which either lack openings <b>or</b> <b>have</b> two openings.

5|$|After a {{few more}} adventures, Candide and Cacambo wander into El Dorado, a {{geographically}} isolated utopia where the streets are covered with precious stones, there exist no priests, {{and all of the}} king's jokes are funny. Candide and Cacambo stay a month in El Dorado, but Candide is still in pain without Cunégonde, and expresses to the king his wish to leave. The king points out that this is a foolish idea, but generously helps them do so. The pair continue their journey, now accompanied by one hundred red pack sheep carrying provisions and incredible sums of money, which they slowly lose <b>or</b> <b>have</b> stolen over the next few adventures.|$|E

5|$|All {{but two of}} the Hydrobatidae {{are mostly}} dark in colour with varying amounts of white on the rump. Two species have {{different}} plumage entirely, the Hornby's storm petrel which has white undersides and facial markings, and the fork-tailed storm petrel which has pale grey plumage. This is a notoriously difficult group to identify at sea. Onley and Scofield (2007) state that much published information is incorrect, and that photographs in the major seabird books and websites are frequently incorrectly ascribed as to species. They also consider that several national bird lists include species which have been incorrectly identified <b>or</b> <b>have</b> been accepted on inadequate evidence.|$|E

5|$|Although Clarke wrote little, {{due in part}} to {{her ideas}} about the role of a female composer, her work was {{recognised}} for its compositional skill. Most of her works have yet to be published (<b>or</b> <b>have</b> only recently been published), and were largely forgotten after she stopped composing. Scholarship and interest in her compositions revived in 1976. The Rebecca Clarke Society was established in 2000 to promote the study and performance of her music.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the many}} other {{statistics}} that are kept are those collectively known as situational statistics. For example, statistics can indicate which specific pitchers a certain batter performs best against.

5|$|Artists in {{the eighteenth}} century (e.g., Henry Fuseli, William Rimmer) {{depicted}} the witches variously, as have many directors since. Some have exaggerated or sensationalised the hags, <b>or</b> <b>have</b> adapted them to different cultures, as in Orson Welles's rendition of the weird sisters as voodoo priestesses. Some film adaptations have cast the witches as such modern analogues as hippies on drugs, or goth schoolgirls. Their influence reaches the literary realm as well in such works as the Discworld and Harry Potter series.|$|E

5|$|As of 2010, Canadians make up 0.5% of the world's total population, having {{relied upon}} {{immigration}} for {{population growth and}} social development. Approximately 41% of current Canadians are first- or second-generation immigrants, and 20% of Canadian residents in the 2000s were not born in the country. Statistics Canada projects that, by 2031, nearly one-half of Canadians above the age of 15 will be foreign-born <b>or</b> <b>have</b> one foreign-born parent.
