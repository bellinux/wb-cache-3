5000|$|Orf is a {{zoonotic}} disease, meaning {{humans can}} contract this disorder through {{direct contact with}} infected sheep and goats or with fomites carrying the <b>orf</b> <b>virus.</b> It causes a purulent-appearing papule locally and generally no systemic symptoms.

It is an uncommon condition and may be difficult to diagnose.|$|E
40|$|Adenoviruses bearing lesions in the E 1 B 55 -kDa protein (E 1 B 55 -kDa) gene are {{restricted}} by the cell cycle such that mutant virus growth is most impaired in cells infected during G 1 and least restricted in cells infected during S phase (F. D. Goodrum and D. A. Ornelles, J. Virol. 71 : 548 – 561, 1997). A similar defect is reported here for E 4 <b>orf</b> 6 -mutant <b>viruses.</b> An E 4 <b>orf</b> 3 -mutant <b>virus</b> was not restricted for growth by the cell cycle. However, orf 3 {{was required for}} enhanced growth of an E 4 <b>orf</b> 6 -mutant <b>virus</b> in cells infected during S phase. The cell cycle restriction {{may be linked to}} virus-mediated mRNA transport because both E 1 B 55 -kDa- and E 4 <b>orf</b> 6 -mutant <b>viruses</b> are defective at regulating mRNA transport at late times of infection. Accordingly, the cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratio of late viral mRNA was reduced in G 1 cells infected with the mutant viruses compared to that in G 1 cells infected with the wild-type virus. By contrast, this ratio was equivalent among cells infected during S phase with the wild-type or mutant viruses. Furthermore, cells infected during S phase with the E 1 B 55 -kDa- or E 4 <b>orf</b> 6 -mutant <b>viruses</b> synthesized more late viral protein than did cells infected during G 1. However, the total amount of cytoplasmic late viral mRNA was greater in cells infected during G 1 than in cells infected during S phase with either the wild-type or mutant viruses, indicating that enhanced transport of viral mRNA in cells infected during S phase cannot account for the difference in yields in cells infected during S phase and in cells infected during G 1. Thus, additional factors affect the cell cycle restriction. These results indicate that the E 4 orf 6 and orf 3 proteins, in addition to the E 1 B 55 -kDa protein, may cooperate to promote cell cycle-independent adenovirus growth...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Reporter {{genes are}} often used as a {{selectable}} marker for generation of recombinant viruses in order to investigate the mechanism of pathogenesis and to obtain candidate vaccine viruses. Routine selection of the recombinant parapoxvirus is time-consuming and labor intensive. Therefore, developing a novel method for selection is critical. Results In this study, we developed a rapid method to generate recombinant <b>Orf</b> <b>viruses</b> (ORFV) based on the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter gene as a selectable marker. The coding sequence of EGFP gene was amplified from pEGFP-N 1 vector and subcloned into the pZIPPY-neo/gus plasmid {{under the control of}} the early-late vaccinia virus (VACV) VV 7. 5 promoter and flanked by two multiple cloning sites (MCS) to generate a novel transfer vector pSPV-EGFP. Using the pSPV-EGFP, two recombination cassettes pSPV- 113 LF-EGFP- 113 RF and pSPV- 116 LF-EGFP- 116 RF were constructed by cloning the flanking regions of the ORFV 113 and ORFV 116 and inserted into two MCS flanking the EGFP gene. Using this novel system, two single gene deletion mutants OV-IA 82 Δ 113 and OV-IA 82 Δ 116 were successfully generated. Conclusions This approach shortens the time needed to generate recombinant ORFVs (rORFVs). Thus, the pSPV-EGFP vector provides a direct, fast, and convenient way to manipulate the recombinant viruses, indicating that it is highly suited for its designed purpose. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: Viruses {{have evolved}} to evade the host’s {{complement}} system.

Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we made use of MHV- 68 to study the role of ORF 4 during infection of fibroblasts. While attachment and penetration of virions lacking the RCA protein were not affected, we observed a delayed delivery of the viral genome to the nucleus of infected cells. Analysis of the phosphorylation status of a variety of kinases revealed a significant reduction in phosphorylation of the protein kinase Akt in cells infected with <b>ORF</b> 4 mutant <b>virus,</b> when compared to cells infected with wt virus.

40|$|Abstract Background Two {{outbreaks}} {{of the disease}} contagious ecthyma were reported in 1999 and 2000 in Norwegian semi-domesticated reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus). Contagious ecthyma is an epidermal disease of sheep and goats worldwide, which {{is caused by the}} zoonotic parapoxvirus <b>orf</b> <b>virus.</b> Characterisation of clinical samples from the two outbreaks in semi-domesticated reindeer in Norway by electron microscopy and PCR (B 2 L) revealed typical parapoxvirus particles and partial gene sequences corresponding to parapoxvirus, respectively. If contagious ecthyma in reindeer is caused by <b>orf</b> <b>virus,</b> the virus may be transferred from sheep and goats, via people, equipment and common use of pastures and corrals, to reindeer. Another possibility is that contagious ecthyma in reindeer is caused by a hitherto unclassified member of the parapoxvirus genus that circulates among reindeer herds and remains endemic in Norway. Results Genomic comparisons of one standard orf strain (orf NZ 2) and the reindeer isolates, employing restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis, demonstrated high similarity between the reindeer viruses and known <b>orf</b> <b>virus</b> strains. Partial DNA sequences of two different viral genes were determined for the different isolates and compared with corresponding parapoxvirus genebank sequences. The comparison/alignment and construction of phylogenetic trees also point to an affiliation of the reindeer viruses to the species <b>orf</b> <b>virus.</b> Conclusion The results of this work imply that the parapoxvirus causing contagious ecthyma in Norwegian semi-domesticated reindeer belongs to the species <b>orf</b> <b>virus</b> and that the <b>orf</b> <b>virus</b> crosses the host species barrier from sheep and goat to semi-domesticated reindeer. </p...|$|E

Other coronaviruses, such as Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and Avian coronavirus, are important livestock pathogens. Ribosome profiling is a technique which exploits the capacity of the translating ribosome to protect around 30 nucleotides of mRNA from ribonuclease digestion. Ribosome-protected mRNA fragments are purified, subjected to deep sequencing and mapped back to the transcriptome to give a global "snap-shot" of translation. Parallel RNA sequencing allows normalization by transcript abundance. Here we apply ribosome profiling to cells infected with Murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus, strain A 59 (MHV-A 59), a model coronavirus in the same genus as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.

Animals inoculated with the <b>ORF</b> 63 mutant <b>virus</b> had lower mean copy numbers of latent VZV genomes in the dorsal root ganglia 5 to 6 weeks after infection than animals inoculated with parental or rescued virus, and the frequency of latently infected animals was significantly lower in animals infected with the <b>ORF</b> 63 mutant <b>virus</b> than in animals inoculated with parental or rescued virus. In contrast, the frequency of animals latently infected with viral mutants in other genes that are equally or more impaired for replication in vitro, compared with the ORF 63 mutant, is similar to that of animals latently infected with parental VZV.

The first was an outbreak of genital form of the disease in a flock imported from France, whilst the second was an outbreak of the disease in the udder skin of ewes and around the mouth of lambs in an indigenous flock. Results: Phylogenetic analysis was performed on a part (498 bp) of the B 2 L gene of 35 Parapoxvirus isolates, including the two <b>Orf</b> <b>virus</b> isolates recovered {{from each of the}} two outbreaks in the present study. This analysis revealed that the maximum nucleotide and amino-acid variation amongst <b>Orf</b> <b>virus</b> strains worldwide (n = 33) was 8. 1 % and 9. 6 %, respectively.

Thus, relatively little is known about its role {{in the context of an}} adenovirus infection. Although considerable earlier work had indicated that the E 4 orf 4 protein is not essential for replication, a recent study using dl 359, an Ad 5 mutant believed to produce a nonfunctional E 4 orf 4 protein, suggested that E 4 orf 4 is essential for virus growth in primary small-airway epithelial cells (C.

Hence, to examine further the role of E 4 <b>orf</b> 4 during <b>virus</b> infection, we generated for the first time a set of E 4 <b>orf</b> 4 <b>virus</b> mutants in a common Ad 5 genetic background. Such mutant viruses included those that express E 4 orf 4 proteins containing various individual point mutations, those defective entirely in E 4 orf 4 expression, and a mutant expressing wild-type E 4 orf 4 fused to the green fluorescent protein. E 4 orf 4 protein was found to localize primarily in nuclear structures shown to be viral replication centers, in nucleoli, and in perinuclear bodies. Importantly, E 4 orf 4 was shown not to be essential for virus growth in either human tumor or primary cells, at least in tissue culture. Unlike E 4 <b>orf</b> 4 -null <b>virus,</b> mutant dl 359 appeared to exhibit a gain-of-function phenotype that impairs virus growth. The dl 359 E 4 orf 4 protein, which contains a large in-frame internal deletion, clustered in aggregates enriched in Hsp 70 and proteasome components. In addition, the late viral mRNAs produced by dl 359 accumulated abnormally in a nuclear punctate pattern. Altogether, our results indicate that E 4 orf 4 protein is not essential for virus growth in culture and that expression of the dl 359 E 4 orf 4 product interferes with viral replication, presumably through interactions with structures in the nucleus...|$|R

Blood samples were collected before and on days 4, 10, 21 and 28 after vaccination. Group 1 pigs were vaccinated with a subunit E 2 vaccine (gp E 2 32 µg/dose), and Group 2 received a subunit vaccine combined with an attenuated <b>ORF</b> <b>virus</b> strain D 1701 106. 45 TCID 50 /dose. Control pigs received a placebo. The total WBC count and percentage of particular cell types were within the normal range in vaccinated and control pigs. Although the mechanism of attenuated <b>ORF</b> <b>virus</b> activity is not clear, changes were observed in CD 4 a+, CD 5 a+, CD 8 a+, CD 45 RA+ and CD 45 RC+ cells in pigs that received {{the combination of a}} subunit vaccine and <b>ORF</b> <b>virus.</b> However, the percentage of wCD 21 + and SWC 3 a+ did not differ significantly from that recorded in pigs given only the subunit vaccine. At days 4 and 10 the number of pigs positive to E 2 antibodies was higher in the group that received the subunit vaccine and <b>ORF</b> <b>virus</b> than in pigs vaccinated with the subunit vaccine only. A higher percentage of memory cells (CD 45 RC+) as well as Th and Tc lymphocytes in pigs that received the <b>ORF</b> <b>virus</b> and the subunit vaccine could be ascribed to a nonspecific influence of the <b>ORF</b> <b>virus</b> on the development (through cognate interactions between T and B cells) and the duration (presumed according to the finding of the clonal expression of memory cells) of humoral immunity (assessed by a higher number of seropositive pigs in this group). This seems likely since the proportion of these cells was found to be lower in the pigs that received E 2 vaccine only. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{epidemiology}} of <b>orf</b> <b>virus</b> {{infection in}} Saudi Arabia (SA) {{has been researched}} since 1990. The results obtained during this period indicate that the disease is widespread, has great economic impact and that no vaccine has been used against it. The present study compares the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of three locally developed live <b>orf</b> <b>virus</b> vaccines. Two of them differ in their passage history in Vero cell culture and the third {{was used as a}} virulent virus in glycerine buffer. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no similar comparative study has been conducted in the Middle East utilising three types of vaccines prepared from the same virus strain. Selection of the candidate seed <b>orf</b> <b>virus</b> and performance of the quality control tests were as laid out by the OIE for veterinary vaccine production. The vaccine seed virus was a field <b>orf</b> <b>virus</b> isolated from a previous orf outbreak in Saudi Arabia. A simple novel formula was developed to calculate the rate of reduction in the healing time (RHT %) in the challenged sheep. This allowed direct comparison of the efficacy of the three types of vaccines employed in the present study. The efficacy of each vaccine was tested on a cohort of local Noemi sheep...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Although orf is endemic {{around the}} world, {{there are few}} {{descriptions}} of <b>Orf</b> <b>virus</b> strains and comparisons of these strains. We report the sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the partial B 2 L gene of <b>Orf</b> <b>virus</b> from two outbreaks of the disease in Greece. The first was an outbreak of genital form of the disease in a flock imported from France, whilst the second was an outbreak of the disease in the udder skin of ewes and around the mouth of lambs in an indigenous flock. Results Phylogenetic analysis was performed on a part (498 bp) of the B 2 L gene of 35 Parapoxvirus isolates, including the two <b>Orf</b> <b>virus</b> isolates recovered {{from each of the}} two outbreaks in the present study. This analysis revealed that the maximum nucleotide and amino-acid variation amongst <b>Orf</b> <b>virus</b> strains worldwide (n = 33) was 8. 1 % and 9. 6 %, respectively. The homology of the nucleotide and amino-acid sequences between the two Greek isolates was 99. 0 % and 98. 8 %, respectively. The two Greek isolates clustered only with <b>Orf</b> <b>virus</b> strains. Conclusions We suggest that there can be differences between strains based on their geographical origin. However, differences in the origin of strains or in the clinical presentation of the disease may not be associated with their pathogenicity. More work is required to determine if differing clinical presentations are linked to viral strain differences or if other factors, e. g., flock immunity, method of exposure or genetic susceptibility, are more important to determine the clinical presentation of the infection. </p...|$|E
40|$|MHV- 68 is a gammaherpesvirus that {{is related}} to Epstein-Barr virus, Kaposi’s sarcoma {{associated}} herpesvirus, and Herpesvirus saimiri. The aim of this thesis was to characterize {{the role of the}} putative plasmid maintenance protein encoded by ORF 73 of MHV- 68 in viral latency and pathogenesis. In order to investigate the role of this gene, MHV- 68 mutant <b>viruses</b> deficient for <b>ORF</b> 73 were constructed and the recombinant viruses were analysed in vitro and in vivo. It was determined that ORF 73 was not required for lytic replication of MHV- 68 in vitro or in vivo. In contrast, a severe deficit in viral latency in vivo was observed in the ORF 73 -deficientviruses suggesting that the virus was unable to persist in the host in the absence of ORF 73. Furthermore it was shown that this gene product is necessary for the maintenance of latent viral episomes in an in vitro assay utilizing a mouse myeloma B-cell line, NSO, indicating that ORF 73 is a critical determinant in gammaherpesvirus latency. In this project I also attempted to rescue the phenotype of the <b>ORF</b> 73 -deficient <b>virus</b> by insertion of an ORF 73 -EGFP expression cassette at an ectopic genomic locus. While expression of ORF 73 at this site enabled maintenance of viral episomes in NSO cells in vitro, the in vivo latency deficit was not restored. Further in vitro characterization of the ORF 73 -deficient and ORF 73 -EGFP rescuant <b>viruses</b> suggests that <b>ORF</b> 73 has a role in the regulation of lytic replication. A final aspect of this project involved the potential use of an <b>ORF</b> 73 -deficient <b>virus</b> as a live-attenuated gammaherpesvirus vaccine. Analysis of vaccinated animals challenged with wild type MHV- 68 showed that exposure to the <b>ORF</b> 73 -deficient <b>virus</b> afforded significant protection against wild type infection and reduced viral latency to a level below the limit of detection. These results indicate that a live-attenuated gammaherpesvirus that cannot persist is an effective vaccine. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Lytic {{replication}} of the tumor-associated human gammaherpesviruses Epstein-Barr virus and Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus {{has important implications}} in pathogenesis and tumorigenesis. Herpesvirus lytic genes have been temporally classified as exhibiting immediate-early (IE), early, and late expression kinetics. Though the regulation of IE and early gene expression has been studied extensively, very little is known regarding the regulation of late gene expression. Late genes, which primarily encode virion structural proteins, require viral DNA replication for their expression. We have identified a murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV- 68) early lytic gene, ORF 18, essential for viral replication. ORF 18 is conserved in both beta- and gammaherpesviruses. By generating an MHV- 68 <b>ORF</b> 18 -null <b>virus,</b> we characterized {{the stage of the}} virus lytic cascade that requires the function of ORF 18. Gene expression profiling and quantitation of viral DNA synthesis of the <b>ORF</b> 18 -null <b>virus</b> revealed that the expression of early genes and viral DNA replication were not affected; however, the transcription of late genes was abolished. Hence, we have identified a gamma-herpesvirus-encoded factor essential for the expression of late genes independently of viral DNA synthesis.

Agar-gel immunodiffusion tests using sera from sheep with naturally-acquired infections and from sheep experimentally inoculated with <b>orf</b> or capripox <b>viruses</b> showed cross reactions. Virus-specific antibody responses to structural proteins of the viruses were analysed by Western-blot analysis. This analysis readily differentiated the infections as either capripox or contagious pustular dermatitis. The antibody responses to the 32 kDa and 26 kDa proteins of capripoxvirus provided a firm basis for differentiation...|$|R
