40|$|As a {{consequence}} of adaptation to the cave environment, the blind Mexican cavefish, Astyanax mexicanus, has evolved several cranial aberrations including changes to bone sizes, shapes and presence of numerous lateral asymmetries. Prior studies of cranial asymmetry in cavefish focused strictly on adult specimens. Thus, {{the extent to which}} these asymmetries emerge in adulthood, or earlier in the life history of cavefish, was unknown. We performed a geometric morphometric analysis of shape variation in the chondrocranium and <b>osteocranium</b> across life history in two distinct cavefish populations and surface-dwelling fish. The cartilaginous skull in juveniles was bilaterally symmetric and chondrocranial shape was conserved in all three populations. In contrast, bony skull shapes segregated into significantly distinct groups in adults. Cavefish demonstrated significant asymmetry for the bones surrounding the collapsed eye orbit, and the opercle bone posterior to the eye orbit. Interestingly, we discovered that cavefish also exhibit directional "bends" in skull shape, almost always biased to the left. In sum, this work reveals that asymmetric craniofacial aberrations emerge later in the cavefish life history. These abnormalities may mirror asymmetries in the lateral line sensory system, reflect a 'handedness' in cavefish swimming behavior, or evolve through neutral processes...|$|E
40|$|In {{the fully}} formed chondrocranium of the basal plate shows a steep incline towards the foramen magnum and orbitoparietal arches are united posteriorly with the basal plate, showing a {{prominent}} ridge. A tectum posterius connects the arches dorsally. The otic capsules are surmounted by the parietal cartilages {{and these are}} not connected with the planum supraseptale by the orbitoparietal commissures. The otic capsule is connected mesially with the basal plate by the basivestibular and sphenocochlear commissures. A prominent dorsum sellae is seen; {{in front of this}} in early stages (6. 5 mm), a hypophysial fenestra is noticed. The hypophysial fenestra is obliterated later. A processus alaris, a processus petrygoideus and a broad ala temporalis are noticed; the latter is imperforate. The pilae metopticae and prooticae are broad and the orbital cartilage is connected with the nasal capsule by the sphenethmoid commissure. Sulci are noticed on the olfactory capsule and the epiphanial foramen is fissure-like. The lamina transversalis is incomplete and there is no complete zona annularis. The lamina transversalis posterior is broad and encloses Jacobson's organ. The posterior paraseptal cartilages are unconnected with the median septum nasi and also with the anterior paraseptal cartilage. At the region where the sulcus anterior separates the anterior and middle portions of the nasal capsule there is an independent piece of cartilage lateral to the cranial wall. There are 5 sets of turbinals. In the <b>osteocranium,</b> the successional appearance and fusion of the various membrane and cartilage bones are described. The study discloses that the chondrocranium of Loris resembles that of Nycticebus and differs from that of Tarsius. ...|$|E
