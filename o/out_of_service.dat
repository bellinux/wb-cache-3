5|$|By 2000, {{deliveries}} were delayed, and in June all trams {{were taken}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> {{for three weeks}} to modify the gearboxes.

The problem was large enough that some trams got a new radial run-out the day after they were fixed. From 6 January 2001, SL95 could be used on the Grünerløkka–Torshov Line, and from 6 February, on the Ekeberg Line. However, the latter still had too short platforms.|$|E

40|$|This diploma {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the issues of organising and carrying <b>out</b> <b>of</b> winter <b>services,</b> such as they fall under the competence of Cestno podjetje Ljubljana, d. d., Sector East. In the opening chapters, the legal framework is presented for the organisation and the carrying <b>out</b> <b>of</b> winter <b>services.</b> A brief summary is provided of the laws, regulations and rules, which constitute the legal basis for the carrying <b>out</b> <b>of</b> winter <b>services.</b> Furthermore, an overview of the road maintenance system is provided, including the carrying <b>out</b> <b>of</b> winter <b>services.</b> This system is divided into several levels <b>of</b> <b>service</b> providers, which are obligated by law to ensure road maintenance is carried out in accordance with set plans. For the carrying <b>out</b> <b>of</b> winter <b>services,</b> relevant background documents, means of transport and other resources, including production and management staff, are instrumental. Also important is the order of activities that need to be carried <b>out</b> as part <b>of</b> winter <b>services</b> and which are divided into preliminary, winter conditions and post-winter activities. The final chapter includes a special cost analysis <b>of</b> winter <b>services</b> activities <b>of</b> Cestno podjetje Ljubljana, d. d., Sector East, whereby the difference in the cost <b>of</b> carrying <b>out</b> <b>of</b> winter <b>services</b> per square kilometre of road for individual road maintenance units is presented...|$|R

5|$|From 3 June 1984, the {{day train}} {{was moved to}} run via Drammen. Until 1989, the Roa–Hønefoss Line had four daily round trips with a local train from Hønefoss via Roa to Oslo, {{normally}} a Class 65 or Class 67 unit. From 1989, this {{was reduced to a}} single round trip, with a morning train from Hønefoss to Oslo and a return in the afternoon. Eventually this was taken over by a Class 69 unit and by the late 1990s taken <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>service.</b> The Roa–Hønefoss Line remains a pure freight track for long-haul freight trains on the Bergen Line. After the opening of the Oslo Tunnel and Oslo Central Station in 1989, passenger trains run via Drammen; however, the Roa–Hønefoss Line is used as a reserve line for passenger trains when the Drammen Line or Randsfjord Line is <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>service.</b>|$|E

5|$|Operation {{proved to}} give several major difficulties, and by March 2001, Oslo Sporveier was {{threatening}} to terminate the purchase agreement unless the manufacturer—who by then had merged to become AnsaldoBreda—fixed the problems. These included the noise being 15dB too loud, and trams being <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> during the January–February cold spell, when batteries and rectifiers would not operate. It was agreed that AnsaldoBreda would have to replace all 256 motors to satisfy the criteria in the contract. By 1 June, AnsaldoBreda had delivered one tram that met all the contract's criteria. Tram 155 was by then still undelivered, and was being used for testing by the manufacturer. At the same time, 149 was being used for tests in Oslo. The trams were taken <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>service,</b> and gradually put back as they were upgraded. In February 2002, tram 155 was equipped with new motors, and a new agreement was made where all motors would be replaced by December 2003, if Oslo Sporveier was satisfied with six months of trials with 155.|$|E
