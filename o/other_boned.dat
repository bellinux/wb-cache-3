5000|$|A Chinese chef's knife — {{sometimes}} referred to as a Caidao, which literally mean [...] "vegetable knife", [...] "Chinese cleaver" [...] or [...] "chopper"— is the rectangular-bladed, all-purpose knife traditionally used in China, Vietnam, Cambodia, and many other Asian countries to prepare a variety of meats, fish, and vegetables. The popularity of this style of knife has spread with the associated cuisines. They resemble Western cleavers in appearance, but most Chinese chef's knives are relatively thin-bladed and designed for slicing, chopping, and mincing vegetables, fish, and boneless meats. Heavier Gudao or bone knives are produced and are used much like Western-type meat cleavers to prepare large sides of beef, pork, and <b>other</b> <b>boned</b> meats. However, Chinese-style knives of this weight are not common in the West.|$|E

They will be the major topic of this review. Other lesions, not strictly odontogenic but also mainly confined to the jaw bones, are giant cell lesions, fibro-osseous lesions, and the melanotic neuro-ectodermal tumour of infancy.
