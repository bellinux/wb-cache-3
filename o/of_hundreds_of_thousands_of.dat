5|$|The Gold Rush {{propelled}} California from a sleepy, little-known backwater to {{a center}} of the global imagination and the destination <b>of</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> people. The new immigrants often showed remarkable inventiveness and civic-mindedness. For example, {{in the midst of}} the Gold Rush, towns and cities were chartered, a state constitutional convention was convened, a state constitution written, elections held, and representatives sent to Washington, D.C. to negotiate the admission of California as a state.|$|E

5|$|The small pro-democracy Monday demonstrations soon swelled into crowds <b>of</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> {{people in}} cities across East Germany. The East German {{leadership}} considered using force but ultimately backed down, lacking support from the Soviet Union for a violent Tiananmen Square-style military intervention. Reformist members of the East German Politbüro sought to rescue the situation by forcing {{the resignation of the}} hardline Party chairman Erich Honecker, replacing him in October 1989 with the marginally less hardline Egon Krenz.|$|E
5|$|By July 1940 the {{situation}} had improved somewhat with uniforms, a modicum of training and the arrival <b>of</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> rifles and millions of rounds of ammunition from the USA. New weapons were developed that could be produced cheaply without consuming materials that were needed to produce armaments for the regular units. An early example was the No. 76 Special Incendiary Grenade (a glass bottle filled with highly flammable material of which more than six million were made), and the No. 73 Grenade (an anti-tank grenade resembling a Thermos flask).|$|E
5|$|Current {{sea level}} rise, {{increased}} cyclonic activity, increased ambient temperatures, and increasingly fickle precipitation patterns are {{effects of global}} warming that have affected or are projected to impact India. Thousands {{of people have been}} displaced by ongoing sea level rises that have submerged low-lying islands in the Sundarbans. Temperature rises on the Tibetan Plateau are causing Himalayan glaciers to retreat, threatening the flow rate of the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Yamuna, and other major rivers; the livelihoods <b>of</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> farmers depend on these rivers. A 2007 World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) report states that the Indus River may run dry for the same reason.|$|E

5|$|Evidence of {{large-scale}} Mesolithic nut processing, radiocarbon dated to circa 7000BC, {{has been found}} in a midden pit at Staosnaig on Colonsay. The dig discovered the remains <b>of</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> burned hazelnut shells and gives an insight into communal activity and forward planning in the period. The nuts were harvested in a single year and pollen analysis suggests that the hazel trees were all cut down at the same time. The scale of the activity, unparalleled elsewhere in Scotland, and the lack of large game on the island, suggests the possibility that Colonsay contained a community with a largely vegetarian diet for the time they spent on the island.|$|E
5|$|Officials {{declared}} mandatory evacuations for 24counties in North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland, {{though in}} general not many left. According {{to a survey}} conducted by the United States Department of Commerce, evacuation rates were estimated as follows; 45% in the Outer Banks, 23% in the area around the Pamlico Sound, 23% in Virginia, and about 15% in Maryland. The threat of Isabel resulted in the evacuation <b>of</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> residents, primarily in North Carolina and Virginia, and included more than 12,000residents staying in emergency shelters.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{situation}} in the North Sea in late 1918 remained much as it had been for the previous four years—with the Grand Fleet maintaining its endless watch over the High Seas Fleet—the war on the Western Front was rapidly drawing to a close. Operation Michael, the last German offensive, had been stopped in late summer, and with the aid <b>of</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> American doughboys, the Allies had begun to overwhelm the German Army.

5|$|The Hajj is {{associated}} with the life of Islamic prophet Muhammad from the 7th century, but the ritual of pilgrimage to Mecca is considered by Muslims to stretch back thousands of years to the time of Abraham. During Hajj, pilgrims join processions <b>of</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> people, who simultaneously converge on Mecca for the week of the Hajj, and perform a series of rituals: each person walks counter-clockwise seven times around the Kaaba (the cube-shaped building and the direction of prayer for the Muslims), runs {{back and forth between the}} hills of Safa and Marwah, drinks from the Zamzam Well, goes to the plains of Mount Arafat to stand in vigil, spends a night in the plain of Muzdalifa, and performs symbolic stoning of the devil by throwing stones at three pillars. The pilgrims then shave their heads, perform a ritual of animal sacrifice, and celebrate the three-day global festival of Eid al-Adha.|$|E
5|$|The dynasty {{was founded}} by the Lǐ family (李), who seized power during the decline and {{collapse}} of the Sui Empire. The dynasty was briefly interrupted when Empress Wu Zetian seized the throne, proclaiming the Second Zhou dynasty (690–705) and becoming the only Chinese empress regnant. In two censuses of the 7th and 8th centuries, the Tang records estimated the population by number of registered households at about 50 million people. Yet, even when the central government was breaking down and unable to compile an accurate census {{of the population in}} the 9th century, it is estimated that the population had grown by then to about 80 million people. With its large population base, the dynasty was able to raise professional and conscripted armies <b>of</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> troops to contend with nomadic powers in dominating Inner Asia and the lucrative trade routes along the Silk Road. Various kingdoms and states paid tribute to the Tang court, while the Tang also conquered or subdued several regions which it indirectly controlled through a protectorate system. Besides political hegemony, the Tang also exerted a powerful cultural influence over neighboring states such as those in Vietnam, Korea and Japan.|$|E
5|$|Rainilaiarivony's first royal wife, Queen Rasoherina, died on 1 April 1868, and was {{succeeded by}} her cousin RanavalonaII (crowned on 3 September 1868) who, like Rasoherina, was a widow of RadamaII. RanavalonaII was a pupil of Protestant missionaries and had {{converted}} to Christianity. Rainilaiarivony recognized the growing power of Christianity {{on the island}} and identified the need to bring it under his influence in order to avert destabilizing cultural and political power struggles. The Prime Minister encouraged the new queen to Christianize the court through a public baptism ceremony at Andohalo on 21 February 1869, the day of their marriage. In this ceremony the supernatural royal talismans were ordered to be destroyed and replaced by the Bible. The Christianization of the court and the establishment of the independent royal Protestant chapel on the palace grounds prompted the wide-scale conversion <b>of</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> Malagasy. These conversions were commonly motivated by a desire to express political allegiance to the Crown, and as such were largely nominal, with the majority of converts practicing a syncretic blend of Christian and traditional religions. Rainilaiarivony's biographers conclude that the Prime Minister's own conversion was also largely a political gesture and most likely did not denote a genuine spiritual shift until late in his life, if ever. Some local officials attempted to force conversions to Protestantism by mandating church attendance and persecuting Catholics, but Rainilaiarivony quickly responded to quell these overzealous practices. The Prime Minister's criminalization of polygamy and alcohol consumption, as well as the declaration of Sunday as a day of rest, were likewise inspired by the growing British and Protestant influences in the country. The Christianization of the court came at a steep personal price: with the outlawing of polygamy, Rainilaiarivony was forced to repudiate his first wife. The Prime Minister was deeply saddened by this necessity and by the consequent souring of his relationships with Rasoanalina and their children after the divorce.|$|E
