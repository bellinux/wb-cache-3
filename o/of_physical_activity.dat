5|$|Historically, {{individuals}} with MS were advised against participation {{in physical activity}} due to worsening symptoms.

Research has supported the rehabilitative role <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> in improving muscle power, mobility, mood, bowel health, general conditioning and quality of life. Depending on the person, activities may include resistance training, walking, swimming, yoga, tai chi, and others. Determining an appropriate and safe exercise program is challenging and must be carefully individualized to each person being sure to account for all contraindications and precautions.|$|E

The theoretical part concerns itself with importance <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> in human life, particularly in a child's life, and point out to the risks and problems connected to a sedentary lifestyle. The practical part focuses on <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> <b>of</b> middle school students in chosen parts of the Usti Region.

Part of this passage is also mapping of current possibilities <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> and sports grounds in this region. Finally, there are several recommended changes presented in the paper that would lead to increase in interest of middle school students in <b>physical</b> <b>activities,</b> namely lowering prices <b>of</b> extracurricular <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> and increase in amount <b>of</b> school <b>physical</b> <b>activities.</b> KEYWORDS: movement, leisure time activities, health, motivatio...|$|R

5|$|Obesity is most {{commonly}} {{caused by a}} combination of excessive food intake, lack <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>activity,</b> and genetic susceptibility. A few cases are caused primarily by genes, endocrine disorders, medications, or mental disorder. The view that obese people eat little yet gain weight due to a slow metabolism is not generally supported. On average, obese people have a greater energy expenditure than their normal counterparts due to the energy required to maintain an increased body mass.|$|E

While individual dogs have their own personalities and abilities, as a breed the Australian Cattle Dog is suited to any activity that calls for athleticism, intelligence, and endurance.|$|E
5|$|Late in life, Henry became obese, with a waist {{measurement}} of , {{and had to}} be moved about with the help of mechanical inventions. He was covered with painful, pus-filled boils and possibly suffered from gout. His obesity and other medical problems can be traced from the jousting accident in 1536, in which he suffered a leg wound. The accident re-opened and aggravated a previous injury he had sustained years earlier, to the extent that his doctors found it difficult to treat. The wound festered for the remainder of his life and became ulcerated, thus preventing him from maintaining the level <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> he had previously enjoyed. The jousting accident is also believed to have caused Henry's mood swings, which may have had a dramatic effect on his personality and temperament.|$|E
40|$|Promotion <b>of</b> regular <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> during {{childhood}} within schools, home and community settings is important as childhood forms {{the foundation for}} <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> habits that can track into adulthood.

40|$|Regular {{implementation}} <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> has {{a positive}} effect on our health, on both social and emotional area of operation as well as learning since it supports the learning and thinking processes. In the master’s thesis we focused on the implementation <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> in teaching in adapted basic education programme of a lower educational standard, attended by children with mild mental disabilities. These children face difficulties in the field of motoric development therefore it is of great importance to promote and implement <b>physical</b> <b>activities.</b> In doing so the teacher can help developing the student’s cognitive, emotional and social fields along with the motoric skills. In some cases the implementation <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> in the teaching process depends on the teacher’s beliefs on the importance of being physically active. Therefore we examined the teachers’ beliefs on the importance <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> both in everyday life and teaching children in adapted basic education programme of a lower educational standard, to what measure and in what way do they implement <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> when teaching children with mild mental disabilities; and what effects they have noticed with their pupils. 97 teachers who teach in the adapted basic education programme of a lower educational standard took part in our research. The research data was acquired through a questionnaire. The results have shown that most teachers have positive beliefs on <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> and their implementation in the teaching process. The majority of teachers often and in diverse ways include <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> while teaching. They also implement <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> at different school subjects, {{in all parts of the}} lessons and at almost all stages of the learning process. There are however some differences in the frequency <b>of</b> implementing <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> between teachers who teach in the first, second or the third educational cycle. Furthermore the frequency <b>of</b> implementing <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> is different with teachers who teach in homogenous or multi-grade classes. The teachers have indicated positive effects <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> on the students’ motoric, emotional, cognitive and social areas of operation. Most teachers do not have any problems with the implementation <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> in their teaching process although some report problems with the children’s behaviour (some students become more difficult to calm down or too lively and thus unpredictable situations arise more quickly), some face time or space constraints or problems connected to teaching in multi-grade classes. The results have shown that teachers who teach in adapted basic education programme of a lower educational standard have positive beliefs on <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> and their use in teaching. They often implement <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> in their teaching process and they have indicated positive effects <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> on their students...|$|R
25|$|Recent {{empirical}} evidence indicates the significant impact <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> on brain function; for example, greater amounts <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> {{are associated with}} enhanced cognitive function in older adults. The effects <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> can be distributed throughout the whole brain, such as higher gray matter density and white matter integrity after exercise training, and/or on specific brain areas, such as greater activation in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Neuroplasticity is also the underlying mechanism of skill acquisition. For example, after long-term training, pianists showed greater gray matter density in sensorimotor cortex and white matter integrity in the internal capsule compared to non-musicians.|$|E
