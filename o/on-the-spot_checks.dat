40|$|One of {{the primary}} tasks of the GeoCAP team of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) Agriculture Unit is to provide {{technical}} and methodological support on the control of Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) subsidies to EU Member State National Administrations involved in the annual Control with Remote Sensing (CwRS) campaigns. This assistance covers {{a broad range of}} issues related not only to the workflow of <b>on-the-spot</b> <b>checks,</b> but also to other relevant topics such as: evaluation of the currency of the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS); quality control of aerial or satellite orthoimagery; area measurements using GPS and many others. The provision and dissemination of technical information through the Web is considered a powerful means to provide immediate assistance to users. However, in order to be effective, the information should be presented in well-structured, ¿subject-oriented¿, manner through a simple and user-friendly interface. There is already a substantial knowledge archive collected in the JRC and organized in different technical guidelines, recommendations, specifications and working documents, for which access needed to be optimized. To address this need, the GeoCAP team implemented a process of review, reorganization and consolidation of the technical and regulatory reference documentation available, in order to provide this knowledge base to users though Wiki-technologies. Such collaborative software tools are already broadly used in Knowledge Management; the use in government services, however, is still quite under developed. In the beginning of 2008, the first version of the system, called WikiCAP, was made available online to the users for review and feedback. JRC. G. 3 -Agricultur...|$|E
