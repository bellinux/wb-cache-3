5|$|More than 99percent of Benet {{graduates}} go to college; roughly 1percent {{serve in}} the military. Benet students were implicated in the University of Illinois clout scandal, in which some applicants were given preferential admission to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) despite having sub-par qualifications. The Chicago Tribune, investigating the scandal, reported {{that a majority of}} students who were admitted to UIUC through political favors came from elite, affluent high schools such as Benet, where families were politically connected with elected officials and university trustees. An email between admissions officers revealed that a female Benet student was admitted to the university's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, {{despite the fact that she}} had ranked lower than 27 of her classmates who were put <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>waiting</b> list or denied admission. Between 2005 and 2009, thirteen applicants from Benet were alleged to have had political connections; eight of them were admitted to UIUC.|$|E
5|$|Three days later, Admiral Coligny {{was walking}} back to his rooms from the Louvre when a shot rang out from a house and wounded him in the hand and arm. A smoking arquebus was {{discovered}} in a window, but the culprit had made his escape {{from the rear of}} the building <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>waiting</b> horse. Coligny was carried to his lodgings at the Hôtel de Béthisy, where the surgeon Ambroise Paré removed a bullet from his elbow and amputated a damaged finger with a pair of scissors. Catherine, who was said to have received the news without emotion, made a tearful visit to Coligny and promised to punish his attacker. Many historians have blamed Catherine for the attack on Coligny. Others point to the Guise family or a Spanish-papal plot to end Coligny's influence on the king.• Frieda, 292. The Duke of Anjou was later reported as saying that he and Catherine had planned the assassination with Anne d'Este, who longed to avenge her husband, Francis, Duke of Guise.• For an overview of historians' various interpretations, see Holt, 83–4. Whatever the truth, the bloodbath that followed was soon beyond the control of Catherine or any other leader.|$|E

25|$|One {{issue with}} trials is what {{to use as}} a placebo {{treatment}} group or non-treatment control group. Often this is patients <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>waiting</b> list, or people receiving some kind of regular non-specific contact or support. One issue {{is the best way to}} match the use of inert tablets or sham treatments in placebo-controlled studies in pharmaceutical trials. Several interpretations and differing assumptions and language remain. Another issue is the attempt to standardize and manualize therapies and link them to specific symptoms of diagnostic categories, making them more amenable to research. Some report that this may reduce efficacy or gloss over individual needs. Finagy and Roth's opinion is that the benefits of the evidence-based approach outweighs the difficulties.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1980s and early 1990s {{the work of}} Emily Kngwarreye, from the Utopia {{community}} north east of Alice Springs, became very popular. Although she {{had been involved in}} craftwork for most of her life, it was only when she was in her 80s that she was recognised as a painter. Her works include Earth's Creation. Her styles, which changed every year, have been seen as a mixture of traditional Aboriginal and contemporary Australian. Her rise in popularity has prefigured that of many Indigenous artists from central, northern and western Australia, such as Kngwarreye's niece Kathleen Petyarre, Minnie Pwerle, Dorothy Napangardi, Lena Pwerle, Angelina Ngale (Pwerle) and dozens of others, all of whose works have become highly sought-after. The popularity of these often elderly artists, and the resulting pressure placed upon them and their health, has become such an issue that some art centres have stopped selling these artists' paintings online, instead placing prospective clients <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>waiting</b> list for work.|$|E

After working there for a year, she decided to enroll in early 1947 at the Ontario College of Art to study sculpting and graduated in 1951. With no prospects for work as a sculptor, between 1951 and 1953, Gage took several part-time jobs, working {{as an assistant to}} the veterinarian, Dr. Edith Williams and as a teaching assistant. Through her association with Williams and her partner, physician Frieda Fraser, Gage met two other Toronto artists, Frances Loring and Florence Wyle. Loring and Wyle felt that Gage had talent and convinced Frieda Fraser to sponsor her in furthering her education at the Art Students League of New York. After studying for two years in New York City, Gage attended L'Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris for eighteen months on scholarship.|$|E

She had studied child behavior and painfully concluded that “children robbed of childhood were likely to become dull, sullen men and women working mindless jobs, or criminals for whom the adventure of crime became the only way {{to break out of the}} bleakness of their lives” [...] Also, one volunteer, Jenny Dow, started a kindergarten class for children left at the settlement while their mothers worked in the sweatshops. Within three weeks, Dow had 24 registered kindergartners and 70 <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>waiting</b> list. At the municipal level, their pursuit of legal reforms led to the first juvenile court in the United States, and their work influenced urban planning and the transition to a branch library system. [...] At the state level Hull House influenced legislation on child labor laws, occupational safety and health provisions, compulsory education, immigrant rights, and pension laws. These experiences translated to success at the federal level, working with the settlement house network to champion national child labor laws, women’s suffrage, a children’s bureau, unemployment compensation, workers' compensation, and other elements of the Progressive agenda during the first two decades of the twentieth century.|$|E
