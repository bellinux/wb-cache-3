5|$|A-clamp or yoke {{connectors}} - {{the connection}} on the regulator surrounds the valve pillar and presses the output O-ring of the pillar valve against the input {{seat of the}} regulator. The connection is officially described as connection CGA850 yoke. The yoke is screwed down snug by hand (<b>overtightening</b> can make the yoke impossible to remove later without tools) and the seal is created by clamping the O-ring between the surfaces of the regulator and valve. When the valve is opened, cylinder pressure expands the O-ring against the outer surface of the O-ring groove in the valve. Insufficient clamping force may allow the pressure to extrude the O-ring between the valve and regulator faces, resulting in a leak. This type of connection is simple, cheap and very widely used worldwide. It has a maximum pressure rating of 232 bar and the weakest part of the seal, the O-ring, is not well protected from overpressurisation.|$|E
25|$|A third cause {{might be}} {{cracks in the}} engine block from <b>overtightening</b> the head bolts. Some engines {{developed}} cracks in the block that would leak coolant and/or oil, sometimes accompanied by broken head bolts directly above the crack.

25|$|Three inch (7.5cm) {{diameter}} bolts connect {{portions of}} the bridge deck mounting bosses to several concrete columns. There are 288 such bolts of various lengths. The bolts were tested in place by <b>overtightening</b> their retaining nuts. In the two weeks subsequent to this tightening, 30 of the first 96 bolts loaded failed. These bolts vary in length from 9 to 17 feet and failure was initially attributed to hydrogen embrittlement, with hydrogen introduced during either manufacturing or electroplating. Some of the bolts can be replaced while others cannot be removed and load transfer will require more complex remediation methods. Repairs were initially not expected to delay the opening, but later it was believed it would delay the opening until December. The fix could cost up to five million dollars. A temporary fix was announced on August 15, 2013, with the opening revised back to its original date. The solution selected was to add a tendon-secured saddle at each deck boss location. It was suggested internally that issues with tensioning the main cable {{may have led to}} the bolt failures.|$|E

50|$|For side-mount chinrests, {{the clamp}} {{is placed on}} the bass side of the instrument; center-mount rests are placed so that the chinrest {{straddles}} the tailpiece. The latter may be considered a safer installation, as the clamps get support from the bottom block, and there is less chance that <b>overtightening</b> will cause damage.|$|E
50|$|Tapered {{threaded}} fittings {{are sometimes}} used on plastic piping. Due to the wedging {{effect of the}} tapered thread, extreme care must be used to avoid <b>overtightening</b> the joint.

There were also problems with the shells cracking under the pressure of <b>overtightened</b> lugs and exposure to freezing temperatures. The original Vistalite line was phased out due to declining sales, the rising cost of oil-based plastics.|$|R

The threads may gall if <b>overtightened</b> or have been corroding in salty air, so a liberal coating of lanolin or a heavy grease {{is not out of}} place on any and all threads. A shackle key or metal marlinspike are useful tools for loosening a tight nut.|$|R

50|$|A {{torque wrench}} {{is a tool}} used to apply {{precisely}} a specific torque to a fastener such as a nut or bolt. It is usually {{in the form of}} a socket wrench with special internal mechanisms. It was invented by Conrad Bahr in 1918 while working for the New York City Water Department. It was designed to prevent <b>overtightening</b> bolts on water main and steam pipe repairs underground.|$|E
50|$|Beverage openers {{are useful}} for opening every day {{beverage}} containers {{for those who have}} limited hand strength as it eliminates the need for strong twisting or pulling motions. Plastic bottles may become stuck due to a high volume of carbonation released during shipping or <b>overtightening.</b> Some do not have fingernails with which to properly use a stay tab and glass bottles almost always require some sort of bottle opener.|$|E
2500|$|A {{test was}} {{performed}} on {{all three of the}} Emergency Feedwater (EFW) pumps serving Unit 3 while the reactor was operating at power. Two of the pumps failed to start as a result of <b>overtightened</b> packing. The third pump failed to start because of a malfunction in the turbine regulating valve pneumatic controller. (ref NRC LER 250/74-LTR) [...] In an ongoing study (ref [...] ) of precursors {{that could lead to a}} nuclear accident if additional failures were to have occurred, the NRC concluded (as of 24-Oct-2005) that this event at Turkey Point Unit 3 was the fifth highest ranked occurrence.|$|R
50|$|A {{micrometer}} {{reading is}} not accurate if the thimble is over- or under-torqued. A useful feature of many micrometers is {{the inclusion of}} a torque-limiting device on the thimble—either a spring-loaded ratchet or a friction sleeve. Without this device, workers may <b>overtighten</b> the micrometer on the work, causing the mechanical advantage of the screw to tighten the screw threads or squeeze the material, giving an inaccurate measurement. However, with a thimble that will ratchet or friction slip at a certain torque, the micrometer will not continue to advance once sufficient resistance is encountered. This results in greater accuracy and repeatability of measurements—most especially for low-skilled or semi-skilled workers, who may not have developed the light, consistent touch of a skilled user.|$|R
50|$|Crank noseband or Swedish Cavesson: {{used most}} often on {{dressage}} horses at levels where a double bridle is worn, this noseband {{is similar to}} the plain cavesson except it has a leveraged buckle design that may be adjusted very tight, so as to keep the horse's mouth closed. Double bridles cannot use flash or drop cavessons, so the crank is usually seen on upper level dressage horses who will not keep the mouth shut. It is also used occasionally on show hunters and hunt seat equitation horses. If adjusted so the horse can't open its jaw at all when the crank is tight, the horse also cannot relax its jaw. Additionally, it can push the cheeks against the horse's teeth when <b>overtightened,</b> which is painful.|$|R
50|$|A {{rubber-like}} backing may {{be placed}} on each hold {{in an effort to}} prevent the holds from spinning. This technique has had mixed success, as eventually the rubber backing begins to peel away from the wall, providing a similar unintended handhold as the chipped resin might. The softer mixture is more durable than a brittle resin, but with uneven climbing walls and <b>overtightening</b> these holds develop slow cracks that eventually render the hold useless.|$|E
50|$|A torque {{screwdriver}} is {{a screwdriver}} with components that ensure tightening to a specified torque, ensuring tightening which is sufficient, but not excessive. An insufficiently tightened screw connection may loosen in operation, and excessive tightening can damage parts; for example, if the nuts holding {{the wheel of}} a car in place are too loose, or damaged by <b>overtightening,</b> a wheel may come off at speed. Torque screwdrivers are used in mechanical production, manufacturing, and maintenance; their use is part of quality assurance.|$|E
50|$|The Philips {{screwdriver}} {{design is}} often criticized for its tendency to cam out at lower torque levels than other, newer pozidriv design. There {{has long been}} a popular belief that this was actually a deliberate feature of the design, for the purpose of assembling aluminum aircraft without <b>overtightening</b> the fasteners. Evidence is lacking for this specific narrative, and the feature is not mentioned in the original patents. However, a subsequent refinement to the original design described in US Patent #2,474,994 describes this feature.|$|E
500|$|On 2 March 2006, a beam in {{the roof}} of the debating chamber swung loose from its hinges during a debate, {{resulting}} in the evacuation of the debating chamber and the suspension of parliamentary business. Parliament moved to other premises while the whole roof structure was inspected and remedial works were carried out. The structural engineers, Arup, stated that the problem with the collapsed beam was entirely due to the failure of one bolt and the absence of another. There was no design fault. The engineers concluded, in a report to MSPs, that the damage is likely to have been done during construction work on the chamber roof, in the latter phases of the project. [...] The report also indicated that whilst one of the bolts was missing, the other was broken and had damaged threads commensurate with being <b>overtightened</b> or jammed, which twisted the head off, or came close to doing so.|$|R
40|$|The lipid cubic phase or in meso method {{can be used}} to set up {{crystallization}} {{trials of}} soluble and membrane proteins. The cubic phase is noted for being a sticky and viscous mesophase. Dispensing the protein-laden mesophase by hand into wells on crystallization plates has been facilitated by the use of an inexpensive repeat dispenser. However, the assembled dispensing device is prone to damage. Specifically, the delicate plunger used to dispense the viscous mesophase by positive displacement can be bent and scarred when the locking nut that fixes the plunger to the ratchet-driven dispensing mechanism is inadvertently <b>overtightened.</b> A defective plunger can render the device useless as a dispensing tool. More importantly, it can lead to catastrophic loss of valuable protein and lipid due to leakage when the dispensing syringe is being recharged with fresh mesophase. This note describes two types of bushings designed to protect the plunger from mechanical damage, which provide facile and reliable dispenser performance. One is a split bushing in brass and is a highly durable solution. The other is a small sleeve made from readily available plastic tubing. While it lacks durability, the plastic sleeve is simple yet highly effective, and can be replaced as the need arise...|$|R
50|$|SMPs {{are smart}} {{materials}} with potential applications as, e.g., intravenous cannula, self-adjusting orthodontic wires and selectively pliable tools for small scale surgical procedures where currently metal-based shape-memory alloys such as Nitinol are widely used. Another application of SMP {{in the medical}} field could be its use in implants: for example minimally invasive, through small incisions or natural orifices, implantation of a device in its small temporary shape. Shape-memory technologies have shown great promise for cardiovascular stents, since they allow a small stent to be inserted along a vein or artery and then expanded to prop it open. After activating the shape memory by temperature increase or mechanical stress, it would assume its permanent shape. Certain classes of shape-memory polymers possess an additional property: biodegradability. This offers the option to develop temporary implants. In the case of biodegradable polymers, after the implant has fulfilled its intended use, e.g. healing/tissue regeneration has occurred, the material degrades into substances which can be eliminated by the body. Thus full functionality would be restored without the necessity for a second surgery to remove the implant. Examples of this development are vascular stents and surgical sutures. When used in surgical sutures, the shape-memory property of SMPs enables wound closure with self-adjusting optimal tension, which avoids tissue damage due to <b>overtightened</b> sutures and does support healing and regeneration.|$|R
50|$|By design, Torx head screws resist cam-out {{better than}} Phillips head or slot head screws. Whereas Phillips heads were {{allegedly}} designed {{to cause the}} driver to cam out, to prevent <b>overtightening,</b> Torx heads were designed to prevent cam-out. The development of better torque-limiting automatic screwdrivers for use in factories allowed this change. Rather than rely on the tool to slip out of the screw head when a desired torque level is reached (which risks damage to the driver tip, screw head, and/or workpiece), torque-limiting driver designs achieve a desired torque consistently.|$|E
50|$|Seatposts {{should be}} {{periodically}} {{removed from the}} frame, cleaned, greased and refitted to prevent the seatpost seizing in the frame. This is particularly important with bikes which do not have mudguards (fenders) that are regularly ridden in wet conditions. Care should be taken not to overtighten the bolt or quick-release lever which clamps the post in the frame, especially where this acts on two brazed lugs rather than a separate clamp-on collar. <b>Overtightening</b> can bend or break the frame lugs or strip the threads in a separate collar. Metal seatposts should be very well greased, with the slot in the bicycle's seat tube also filled with a smear of grease. This helps to prevent water from running down the seat tube.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{critical}} to avoid over-tightening the nut or else {{the integrity of the}} compression fitting will be compromised by the excessive force. If the nut is overtightened the ferrule will deform improperly causing the joint to fail. Indeed, <b>overtightening</b> is {{the most common cause of}} leaks in compression fittings. A good rule of thumb is to tighten the nut first by hand until it is too difficult to continue and then tighten the nut one half-turn more with the aid of a wrench; the actual amount varies with the size of the fitting, as a larger one requires less tightening. The fitting is then tested: if slight weeping is observed, the fitting is gradually tightened until the weeping stops.|$|E
40|$|In photo, an {{engineer}} {{is using a}} new Ultrasonic Bolt Stress Monitor developed by NASA's Langley Research Center {{to determine whether a}} bolt is properly tightened. A highly accurate device, the monitor is an important tool in construction of such structures as pressure vessels, bridges and power plants, wherein precise measurement of the stress on a tightened bolt is critical. <b>Overtightened</b> or undertightened bolts can fail and cause serious industrial accidents or costly equipment break-downs. There are a number of methods for measuring bolt stress. Most widely used and least costly is the torque wrench, which is inherently inaccurate; it {{does not take into account}} the friction between nut and bolt, which has an influence on stress. At the other end of the spectrum, there are accurate stress-measuring systems, but they are expensive and not portable. The battery-powered Langley monitor fills a need; it is inexpensive, lightweight, portable and extremely accurate because it is not subject to friction error. Sound waves are transmitted to the bolt and a return signal is received. As the bolt is tightened, it undergoes changes in resonance due to stress, in the manner that a violin string changes tone when it is tightened. The monitor measures the changes in resonance and provides a reading of real stress on the bolt. The device, patented by NASA, has aroused wide interest and a number of firms have applied for licenses to produce it for the commercial market...|$|R
5000|$|As {{the output}} of an impact wrench, when hammering, is a very short impact force, the actual {{effective}} torque is difficult to measure, with several different ratings in use. As the tool delivers a fixed amount of energy with each blow, rather than a fixed torque, the actual output torque changes with {{the duration of the}} output pulse. If the output is springy or capable of absorbing energy, the impulse will simply be absorbed, and virtually no torque will ever be applied, and somewhat counter-intuitively, if the object is very springy, the wrench may actually turn backwards as the energy is delivered back to the anvil, while it is not connected to the hammer and able to spin freely. [...] A wrench that is capable of freeing a rusted nut on a very large bolt may be incapable of turning a small screw mounted on a spring. [...] "Maximum torque" [...] is the number most often given by manufacturers, which is the instantaneous peak torque delivered if the anvil is locked into a perfectly solid object. [...] "Working torque" [...] is a more realistic number for continually driving a very stiff fastener. [...] "Nut-busting torque" [...] is often quoted, with the usual definition being that the wrench can loosen a nut tightened with the specified amount of torque in some specified time period. Accurately controlling the output torque of an impact wrench is very difficult, and even an experienced operator will have a hard time making sure a fastener is not undertightened or <b>overtightened</b> using an impact wrench. Special socket extensions are available, which take advantage of the inability of an impact wrench to work against a spring, to precisely limit the output torque. Designed with spring steel, they act as large torsion springs, flexing at their torque rating, and preventing any further torque from being applied to the fastener. Some impact wrenches designed for product assembly have a built-in torque control system, such as a built-in torsion spring and a mechanism that shuts the tool down when the given torque is exceeded. When very precise torque is required, an impact wrench is only used to snug down the fastener, with a torque wrench used for the final tightening. Due to the lack of standards when measuring the maximum torque, some manufacturers are believed to inflate their ratings, or to use measurements with little bearing on how the tool will perform in actual use. Many air impact wrenches incorporate a flow regulator into their design, either as a separate control or part of the reversing valve, allowing torque to be roughly limited in one or both directions, while electric tools may use a variable speed trigger for the same effect.|$|R
30|$|For {{the needs}} of the present study, all {{patients}} with an acute (<[*] 10  days) ATR that was operatively treated in our institute with a percutaneous suture using the Dresden instrument over a 7 -year period (10 / 2003 – 10 / 2010) were included and retrospectively evaluated. All the patients gave their informed consent prior to inclusion in the study; the local ethics committee approved the study (EA 2 / 095 / 11). An electronic ICD- 9 search was conducted and the identified patients were contacted by telephone or by mail to invite them for a follow-up examination. Overall, 153 patients were identified and contacted. In total, 118 patients (follow-up rate: 77.1 %) agreed {{to take part in the}} study. The median patient age of the included patients was 42  years (range 24 – 73  years). The majority of the patients were men (n[*]=[*] 102; 84.3 % male). The mean follow-up was 33.45  months (range 12 – 82  months; SD 21.67). In most cases (89.2 %), the ATR happened due to sports-related injuries. The Achilles tendon rupture was located on the left in 53.7 % and on the right side in 46.3 %. Indications for percutaneous suture were type 2 a and 3 a ruptures (according to the Amlang classification) that were no older than 10  days, with sonographically incomplete adaptation of the ruptured ends of the tendon in 20 ° plantar flexion [16]. Percutaneous suture was not performed for older or open ruptures, or in re-rupture cases. The detailed surgical technique employed has been described elsewhere [17]. Briefly, a 2 -cm skin incision was made about 5  cm proximal to the rupture site. The Dresden instrument was inserted subfascially while ensuring that the underlying paratenon remained intact. Both instruments were advanced until they were as close to the tendon insertion as possible, with one lying medial and one lateral to the distal tendon stump. Two straight needles armed with resorbable PDS II No. 1 (Ethicon®, Johnson & Johnson) were pierced through the skin–instrument–tendon–instrument–skin. The instruments were then pulled back so that the sutures were diverted through the proximal incision, and the pull-out strength of the sutures was tested thoroughly. The repair was completed with a Krackow locking stitch in the proximal tendon stump, while the ATR was secured in an <b>overtightened</b> manner. Postoperatively, the foot was placed in a walker in the 30 ° equinus position for a period of 6  weeks with partial weight-bearing. After the sixth week, the heel height was reduced 10 ° per week and weight-bearing was increased as tolerated. From the ninth postoperative week, the patients were allowed to walk in a normal shoe. A standardized physiotherapeutic regimen was handed out to each patient and consisted of functional muscle training, proprioceptive training, and stretching exercises, while scar tissue massage was started from the third postoperative week. The following data were included in the analysis: subjective pain intensity and subjective functional limitation were measured on a 10 -point visual analogue scale (VAS); the Hannover score [18]; the Achilles tendon total rupture score (ATRS) [19]; the AOFAS ankle-hindfoot score; and the Tegner activity score for assessing the pre-injury and postoperative levels of sporting activity. Peri- and postoperative complications were evaluated. Moreover, the maximum calf circumference (MCC) at a level of 15  cm distally to the medial knee joint line and the ankle range of motion (ROM) of both the injured and the contralateral sides were documented, and the Matles test was carried out in order to examine tendon lengthening. A single trained person performed all measurements with an intraobserver variability of less than 5 %. Finally, we also examined the effect of the time point of surgery after trauma.|$|R
