5|$|A thick-line version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>map,</b> {{released}} {{as part of}} Metro's Rush Plus plan, showed the Silver Line spurring off the Orange Line between the Ballston and East Falls Church stations in a northwesterly direction, with five unlabeled stops (the Phase I stations). The final map released for the Silver Line's Phase I opening features the stations shared by the three lines as normal stations, with the dots signifying stations located on the colored line {{in the center and}} small white stubs extending from the center dots into the adjoining colored lines.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, predating Booth's attempt, WMATA {{released}} a professionally designed graphic that displayed the Silver Line on an unofficial map that resembled the current version, but with thin lines. The interplay between Metro's unofficial proposal {{and those of}} other designers received attention in a number of press outlets. A poster displaying a map of similar design has been hanging in DC Councilman Jack Evans' office for a number of years, but received scant attention until 2008. Wyman, one of the original designers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>map,</b> was confirmed as the layout specialist who would be redesigning the map by the Washington Post on June 4, 2011.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the single-player missions, The World Is Not Enough features a multiplayer mode where up to four players can compete {{against each other in}} different game types, ranging from the traditional deathmatch to objective-based games such as capture the flag or king of the hill. Other game types include Last Agent Standing, where players begin the game with a finite number of lives and must survive until the opposing players exhaust their lives, and Uplink, in which players must find and touch uplink units scattered in key locations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>map</b> to score points. Multiplayer games can be played on 14 different maps and can also include bots. Bots' appearance and amount of health can be changed to match player preference.|$|E

5|$|The {{conditions}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>MAP,</b> however, {{stipulated that}} no Annual National Programme could be launched until 63 military facilities are transferred from Bosnia's political divisions {{to the central}} government, {{which is one of}} the conditions for the OHR closure. The leadership of the Republika Srpska has opposed this transfer as a loss of autonomy. Bosnia's chances of joining NATO may depend on Serbia's attitude towards the alliance, since the leadership of Republika Srpska might be reluctant to go against Serbian interests. In October 2017, the National Assembly of the Republika Srpska passed a nonbinding resolution opposing NATO membership for Bosnia and Herzegovina.|$|E
5|$|A new county-designated highway {{appeared}} on maps {{for the first}} time in 1983, H-16; it was marked as running between US2 and M-28 only. This designation was removed in the 1985 edition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>map.</b> The H-16 label reappeared in 1992; this time it was shown continuing south toward the Wisconsin state line and north to M-38, along the routing of FFH-16. The roadway is part of the Forest Highway System that is funded and administered by the US Forest Service and the Federal Highway Administration; the system was created by the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921. The highway has never been included in the CDH system as Iron, Houghton and Ontonagon counties do not participate in the system, and the Upper Peninsula east of US41 is the G zone, not the H zone.|$|E
5|$|Battles {{take place}} on grid-based {{self-contained}} maps and are governed by a turn-based system where units on both sides are given their chance to move and act. Once a unit has moved, depending on their position relative to allied units and enemies, they may perform actions such as attacking or supporting allied characters through statistic-enhancing abilities, or they can wait until the next turn. When attacking, the game transitions from the top-down view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>map</b> to a side-view battlefield, where a cinematic battle plays between the player and enemy units. Each unit has access to different weapons and items, but these will break {{after a number of}} uses and must be repaired in between missions. The effectiveness of melee weapons is dictated with the series' recurring Weapons Triangle mechanic: axes are strong against lances, lances strong against swords, and swords strong against axes. Villages found during map battles will be attacked; if defended by the player, non-player characters within the village will give hints about future objectives. A map is cleared when the boss is defeated. If characters fall in battle, they are subjected to permanent death, removing them {{from the rest of the}} game. If Roy dies, the game ends and the map must be restarted.|$|E

5|$|Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter is a side-scrolling {{platform}} video game: {{the majority}} of the game features the player-controlled Commander Keen viewed from the side while moving on a two-dimensional plane. The player can move left and right and can jump, and can use a pogo stick to bounce continuously and jump higher than they can normally with the correct timing. The levels are composed of platforms on which Keen can stand, viewed from slightly above. Some platforms allow Keen to jump up through them from below, while others feature fireman's poles that Keen can climb up or down. Keen can also grab onto the edge of platforms and pull himself up. There are giant switches which must be jumped up into or dropped onto to flip which have effects on the gameworld, such as retracting and extending gates or initiate moving platforms. Once entered, the only way to exit a level is to reach the end, though the player can save their game at any point. Between levels, the player travels on a two-dimensional map, viewed from above; from the map the player can enter levels by approaching the entrance or save their progress in the game. Some levels are optional to enter and may be bypassed, while portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>map</b> are gated off until specific levels are completed.|$|E
5|$|Cortex sends his loyal Lab Assistants to {{find the}} pieces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>map</b> {{scattered}} throughout the big City {{and bring them to}} him. Now that the contestants know about the map, the Viscount decides to reveal his true intentions: the Super Big Power Crystal can grant a single wish who whoever obtains it, and the Viscount is willing to give a large sum of money to those who help him find it. Finding the Power Crystal is impossible without the Final Key, so the Viscount boards his plane to travel to the North Atlantic Ocean in search for the Final Key. But the plane is full, and only a select number of the contestants are able to board. Propelled to the skies by an explosive volcano, the contestants are able to board the Viscount's plane.|$|E
5|$|Defense of the Ancients is {{maintained}} via official forums. Users can post ideas for new heroes or items, {{some of which}} are added to the map. Players have contributed icons and hero descriptions and created the artwork displayed while the map loads, and suggestions for changes to existing heroes or items are taken seriously; IceFrog once changed a new hero less than two weeks after the new version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>map</b> was released. Versions of the scenario where enemy heroes are controlled by artificial intelligences have also been released. Mescon continued to maintain dota-allstars.com, which by the end of IceFrog's affiliation in May 2009 had over 1,500,000 registered users and had received over one million unique visitors every month. Due to their separation, IceFrog announced that he would be further developing a new official site, playdota.com, while continuing game development; Mescon closed dota-allstars on July 22, 2010, citing dropping statistics and his new passion for League of Legends as the reason for its end.|$|E

50|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>maps</b> are <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scale 1:1,000,000 or 1:500,000. However, <b>the</b> environs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three greater centers (Athens, Rome, Byzantium-Constantinople) are {{presented}} in 1:150,000. Some remote regions, where Greeks and Romans mostly explored and traded rather than settled (i.e. Baltic, Arabia, East Africa, India, Sri Lanka), are <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scale 1:5,000,000. Due to <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> base <b>maps</b> used for <b>the</b> background and time-cost restrictions, elevation lines (contours) were left in feet except for <b>the</b> 1:150,000 <b>maps</b> where they are in meters. <b>The</b> projection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>maps</b> is Lambert Conformal Conic.

5|$|In August 1979, Atari {{produced}} an arcade game {{version of the}} concept called Lunar Lander. This version featured monochrome vector graphics and allowed the player to rotate the ship right or left and fire thrusters controlled with a proportional throttle control system using a joystick with a spring. Like Moonlander, both a graphical display of a repeating mountainous surface {{as well as a}} text readout of the ship's speed, altitude, and remaining fuel are displayed. Once a game begins, it only ends when a player runs out of fuel, rather than due to a time limit; players can insert quarters to add fuel to their current game. Bonus points are awarded for landing on difficult parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>map.</b> The game features four levels of difficulty in controlling the ship. Lunar Lander was Atari's first vector graphics game and the first multiple-perspective video game; when the lander got close to the surface, the view changed to a close-up view of the lander. The vector engine was inspired by Space Wars (1978) and created by Rick Moncrief and Howard Delman, who developed Lunar Lander alongside Rich Moore. The idea for the game came from Delman, who had seen a graphical version of the game, likely Moonlander, a few years prior. At least one other arcade game based on the Lunar Lander concept was developed around the same time, Lunar Rescue by Taito.|$|E
5|$|Like {{previous}} {{games in}} the Mana series, Heroes of Mana features a top-down perspective, in which the player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures and enemies. Unlike prior {{games in the}} series, which are typically action role-playing games, Heroes is a real-time strategy game (RTS), in which the player controls up to 25 units in battles on fixed maps. Units are controlled via the Nintendo DS touch screen, selected by tapping on them and sent to destinations or to attack by tapping on their target. The game world is divided into an isometric grid, with one unit allowed per space. The Nintendo DS's second screen shows {{a map of the}} current mission, including which parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>map</b> can currently be seen by the player's units and which parts are covered by fog of war. Individual units and enemies are shown on the map in the visible areas.|$|E
5|$|The classic {{types are}} the deathmatch (and its team-based variant) in which players score points by killing other players' characters; and capture the flag, in which teams attempt to {{penetrate}} the opposing base, capture a flag {{and return it to}} their own base whilst preventing the other team from doing the same. Other game modes may involve attempting to capture enemy bases or areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>map,</b> attempting to take hold of an object {{for as long as possible}} while evading other players, or deathmatch variations involving limited lives or in which players fight over a particularly potent power-up. These match types may also be customizable, allowing the players to vary weapons, health and power-ups found on the map, as well as victory criteria. Games may allow players to choose between various classes, each with its own strengths, weaknesses, equipment and roles within a team.|$|E
40|$|According to seminal work <b>of</b> Kontsevich, <b>the</b> {{unstable}} homology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mapping</b> class group <b>of</b> {{a surface}} can be computed via <b>the</b> homology <b>of</b> a certain lie algebra.

Moreover, we classify certain generalized Bernoulli shifts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mapping</b> class group up to orbit equivalence.

50|$|This action, {{together}} with combinatorial and geometric properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> curve complex, {{can be used}} to prove various properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mapping</b> class group. In particular, it explains some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hyperbolic properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mapping</b> class group: while as mentioned in the previous section <b>the</b> <b>mapping</b> class group is not an hyperbolic group it has some properties reminiscent of those.|$|R
5|$|The free-for-all {{and team}} {{versions}} of Shootout mode both follow a traditional deathmatch scenario where players or teams must accumulate the most kills. Many capture the flag variants are also available. Hold Your Own {{is a traditional}} mode where each team has to defend their bag of gold from the enemy team whilst capturing the other. Grab The Bag has both teams attacking one bag placed in a section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>map.</b> Gold Rush is a free-for-all variant, trying to grab and keep as many bags as possible. The multiplayer portion Red Dead Redemption also features open world gameplay. All players in the server can form or join a group of other players, known as a posse, of up to eight players and take part in activities such as hunting or attacking computer-controlled gang hideouts or another player's posse. In some game modes, players are unable to kill other players.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} an open world environment with a day-night cycle and dynamic weather system {{which can be}} seamlessly explored. The map is composed of forest, jungle, desert, and snowy mountain regions. Mountainous terrain is traversed with the employment of parkour, which is aided {{by the use of}} zip-lines installed throughout the world. Corruption Zones constitute areas that heighten difficulty and are populated by corrupted machines that behave with more aggression. To uncover more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>map,</b> one must scale large giraffe-like machines known as Tallnecks. Twenty-five robotic creature designs are present in the game. Save points and fast travel can be accessed by interacting with campfires, once discovered. The quest structure unfolds to accommodate the exploration of tribes, while the main story covers the entire world. Side quests involve Aloy completing tasks, like gathering materials, coming to the aid of individuals in danger of being killed, solving mysteries, assuming control of bandit camps, eliminating criminals and more difficult machines, accomplishing various challenges at any of the five Hunting Grounds, and obtaining an ancient armour that makes Aloy almost impervious to damage. A dialogue wheel is used to communicate with non-playable characters. Collectibles include vantages that offer visual information of the Old World; metal flowers, which when acquired contain poetry; and old relics, such as ancient mugs and tribal artefacts.|$|E
5|$|The {{game is a}} turn-based {{strategy}} and revolves around the British 6th Airborne Division's attempts to secure Bénouville Bridge (later renamed Pegasus Bridge, in honour of the battle) over the Caen Canal during the Normandy landings on 5 June 1944. The player is able to command either the British or German side in the game. Regardless of the side chosen, British units will not appear on the map {{at the beginning of}} the game as the British 6th Airborne Division have not yet made their parachute drops. German forces are distributed around the four far corners <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>map,</b> with a few units positioned near Bénouville Bridge. If playing as the British, the objective is to defeat all German forces and secure all bridges in the area, with the capture or destruction of the Merville Battery being the ultimate goal. If playing as the Germans, the only objective is to hold off all British attacks for 18 hours, which is the equivalent to 36 in-game turns.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> actual form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mapping</b> {{will depend}} on the chosen implementation. Some {{implementations}} may limit <b>the</b> granularity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mapping</b> which may limit <b>the</b> capabilities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> device.
