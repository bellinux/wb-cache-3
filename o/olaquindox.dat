In addition, the effects of QdNOs on the integrity of bacterial cell walls and membranes as well as the morphological alterations and DNA oxidative damage in C. perfringens and B. hyodysenteriae were analyzed. It was demonstrated that under anaerobic conditions, QdNOs were metabolized into the reduced products which did not show any antibacterial activity. A significant dose-related increase of intracellular ROS level and intracellular hydroxyl radicals were evident in bacteria exposed to QdNOs. The result of biochemical assay showed that the cell walls and membranes of the bacteria treated with QdNOs were damaged. After exposure to 1 / 2 MIC to 4 MIC of CYA and OLA, C. perfringens and B. hyodysenteriae became elongated and filamentous. Morphological observation with scanning and transmission electron microscopes revealed rupture, loss of cytoplasmic material and cell lysis in QdNO-treated bacteria, indicating serious damage of cells. There was an increase of 8 -OHdG in the two strains treated by QdNOs, but it was lower in Gram-positive than in Gram-negative bacteria. Agarose gel electrophoresis showed the degradation of chromosomal DNA in both of the two anaerobes treated by QdNOs.

A quantitative and confirmatory method for determining the presence of CBX and OLA in poultry and swine feed by high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) was developed, optimized, and validated. The analytes extraction was performed with a mixture of water and acetonitrile (1 : 1 v/v) and cleanup with hexane and C 18 (dispersive phase). The method was evaluated by the following parameters: specificity, linearity, matrix effect, decision limits (CCα), detection capability (CCβ), accuracy, precision, limits of detection (LoD), limits of quantification (LoQ) and measurement uncertainty. The validated method presented a broad linear study range and no significant matrix effect. The limit of detection (LoD) was defined at 9 μgkg− 1 for CBX and 80 μgkg− 1 for OLA, and the limit of quantification (LoQ) was defined at 12 μgkg− 1 and 110 μgkg− 1 for CBX and OLA, respectively. The accuracy of the method was adequate for CBX and OLA. The recovery values found in the repeatability conditions were 99. 41 % for CBX and 104. 62 % for OLA. Under intralaboratory reproducibility conditions, the values were 98. 63 % for CBX and 95. 07 % for OLA.

However, the impact of antibiotics on gut microbiota in the gastrointestinal tract is not completely understood, although antibiotic-induced alterations in the distal gut have been reported. Here, employing a piglet model, the microbial composition was analyzed by high-throughput 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and PICRUSt predictions of metagenome function. The present study showed clear spatial variation of microbial communities in the stomach and intestine, {{and found that the}} administration of antibiotics (a mixture of <b>olaquindox,</b> oxytetracycline calcium, kitasamycin) in early life caused markedly differential alterations in the compartmentalized microbiota, with major alterations in their spatial variation in the lumen of the stomach and small intestine. In piglets fed an antibiotic-free diet, most of the variation in microbial communities was concentrated in gut segments and niches (lumen/mucosa). The microbial diversity was higher in the lumen of stomach and duodenum than that in ileum. The early-life antibiotic intervention decreased the abundance of some Lactobacillus species and increased the abundance of potentially pathogenic Streptococcus suis in the lumen of the stomach and small intestine. Interestingly, the intervention increased the abundance of Treponema only in the colonic lumen and that of Faecalibacterium only in the ileal mucosa. Furthermore, the antibiotic intervention exerted location-specific effects on the functional potential involved in the phosphotransferase system (decreased sucrose phosphotransferase in the stomach) and antibiotic-resistance genes (increased in the colon). These results point to an early-life antibiotic-induced dramatic and location-specific shift in the gut microbiota, with profound impact in the foregut and less impact in the hindgut. Collectively, these findings provide new insights into the membership of the microbiota along the gastrointestinal tract of piglets and highlight the importance of considering the foregut microbiota in health management of piglets at early life. </p...|$|E
40|$|Most feeds for broilers, {{pigs and}} veal calves, but 1 / 3 of feeds for beef cattle, are {{supplemented}} with an antimicrobial growth promoter. A European regulation list allows antimicrobial growth promoter, concentrations, animal species, and withdrawal periods (often null). Presently, avilamycin, flavomycin, lasalocid, monensin, and salinomycin are allowed. Avoparcin, bacitracin, carbadox, <b>olaquindox,</b> spiramycin, tylosin, and virginiamycin use was suspended by EU in 1997 and 98. Permitted doses are around 20 ppm (= 20 g/t feed). Animals given antimicrobial growth promoter supplemented feeds grow {{faster and more}} uniformly than controls (average daily gain improved by 3 to 9 %). They have a lower feed intake per weight gain (the feed conversion ratio is reduced by 3 to 12 %), and release less nitrogen in the environment. The mechanism of growth promotion by antimicrobial growth promoters is still speculative. However, the growth promotion is likely due to a modification of the gut flora, since antimicrobial growth promoters do not promote the growth of germfree animals. Moreover, a modified antimicrobial growth promoter molecule promotes growth {{only as long as}} it retains antimicrobial potency. Most studies show no or little changes in the composition of gut flora during antimicrobial growth promoter supplementation. By contrast, antimicrobial growth promoters strongly suppress the bacterial catabolism of urea and amino-acids, both in vitro and in vivo. Antimicrobial growth promoters also decrease the fermentation of carbohydrates and the decomposition of bile salts. These changes increase the availability of nutrients and energy to the animal host (sparing effect), and decrease the concentration of toxic molecules like ammonia or amines in the gut, leading to a reduced turnover in the gut epithelium. In cattle, the rumen flora fermentations are oriented toward propionic acid production, instead of acetic acid, favouring the meat deposit, and less methane is produced. Because antimicrobial growth promoters show maximum efficacy in farms with poor hygiene, some authors argue that another beneficial effect of antimicrobial growth promoters lies in an improved control of pathologies (e. g., necrotic enteritis in poultry, swine dysentery in pigs) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{customized}} DNA microarray {{was designed}} to detect Escherichia coli virulence genes in addition to Gram-negative genes conferring resistance to antimicrobials belonging to the aminoglycoside, 3 ̆b 2 -lactam, tetracycline, sulfonamide, phenicol, and quinolone families {{as well as to}} rifampin, erythromycin, trimethoprim, <b>olaquindox,</b> quaternary ammonium compound resistant determinant genes, and mobile genetic elements such as class 1, 2, 3 integrons and transposon Tn 21. This microarray was applied in the genotyping of two collection strains coming from colibacillosis outbreaks in rabbit and cattle facilities located in Italy and Iran, respectively. For each collection, the positive gene distribution and frequency per encoded enzyme or protein involved in antimicrobial resistance was first determined. Thereafter, strains positive for integrons were matched with the presence of transposon Tn 21 (tnpM gene) in order to highlight the genetic potential of resistance (multi-resistance) transferability in the examined strains. Fourteen of 26 strains in our rabbit E. coli collection were positive for a class 1 integron, six of which were associated with the tnpM gene and multidrug resistance-related genes to the aminoglycoside, tetracycline, and sulfonamide-trimethoprim antimicrobial families, prevalently. Class 1 and/or class 2 and 3 integrons were also detected in 23 out of 51 strains in our cattle E. coli collection, 13 of which were also positive for tnpM gene. The presence of multiple drug resistance involving the aminoglycoside, tetracycline, and sulfonamide antimicrobial families are positively associated with this tnpM gene group. Moreover, strains having positive genes for integrons and transposons were also carriers, to a lesser extent, of class A and/or class C 3 ̆b 2 -lactamase (11 strains) and quinolone (9 strains) resistant genes. The DNA microarray used in this chapter {{has proven to be a}} powerful tool in determining the genetic profile of antimicrobial resistance in E. coli field strains. The DNA microarray technology may be an appropriate technology for inclusion in antimicrobial resistance monitoring programs because of its adaptability to and ease of data collection for any particular monitoring program. Furthermore, this technology could be used to assess the effectiveness of antimicrobial use-reduction plans or in comparative studies between traditional and antibiotic-free animal production systems.

40|$|Foi investigado o efeito da substituição de antibióticos por prebiótico, probiótico e simbiótico em dietas para frangos de corte de 1 a 45 dias de idade. Foram utilizados 750 pintos de 1 dia de idade, distribuídos em cinco tratamentos, sendo: T 1 -sem aditivos, T 2 -antibiótico (<b>Olaquindox</b> â e Nitrovin â), T 3 -prebiótico (0, 2 % de parede celular de S. cerevisiae), T 4 -probiótico (300 ppm de B. subtilis) e T 5 -simbiótico (T 3 + T 4). O desempenho dos frangos de 1 - 45 dias de idade foi influenciado pelos diferentes tratamentos, sendo o melhor ganho de peso observado em aves que receberam o simbiótico, seguido daquelas com antibiótico, prebiótico e probiótico. O pior ganho de peso foi observado nas aves que não receberam qualquer tipo de aditivo na dieta. A conversão alimentar, no período de 1 a 45 dias de idade, também foi influenciada pelo tipo de aditivo. As aves que não receberam suplementação apresentaram pior conversão alimentar quando comparadas com as aves dos demais tratamentos. Os resultados deste experimento permitem concluir que a substituição de antibióticos por simbióticos na ração de frangos é uma alternativa viável, pois não compromete o desempenho das aves, contudo a ausência de aditivos na dieta piora o desempenho das mesmas. This {{study was}} carried out with the {{objective}} to test the substitution of antibiotics by prebiotics, probiotics or symbiotics in broiler chickens diet up to 45 days of age. Day-old chicks (n= 750) were divided in five treatments, as follow: T 1 -no additives, T 2 -antibiotics (Olaquindoxâ e Nitrovinâ), T 3 -prebiotic (0. 2 % de S. cerevisiae cell wall), T 4 -probiotics (300 ppm B. subtilis) and T 5 -symbiotic (T 3 + T 4). The performance of broilers up to 45 days of age was influenced by treatments, with better weight gain observed in the birds fed with symbiotics, followed by antibiotcs, prebiotics and probiotics. The worse body weight gain was obtained by the broilers whose diet was not supplemented by any additive. During this period, feed conversion was also affected depending on the additive used, since the birds not supplemented showed the worse results {{when compared to the}} birds of the other treatments. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} the substitution of antibiotics by symbiotics in broiler chicken diets is an alternative to poultry industry, since no negative effect was found on performance. However, the total absence of additives in the diets worsened the broiler chicken performance...|$|E
40|$|The porcine proliferative enteropathies (PPE) are a {{group of}} {{diseases}} ranging from intestinal adenomatosis (PIA), a chronic condition causing reduced growth rates in post weaning pigs, to the often fatal proliferative haemorrhagic enteropathy (PHE), resulting in intestinal haemorrhage. PHE predominantly occurs in older and heavier pigs than the chronic disease PIA. This thesis examined whether the age when susceptible pigs are infected affects the clinical response to L. intracellularis infection. The characteristic pathologic lesion of PPE is the abnormal proliferation of crypt epithelial cells in the ileum and colon. Closely associated with this proliferation is the presence of an obligately intracellular bacterium, Lawsonia intracellularis. Characterisation of L. intracellularis was performed in in-vitro co-cultures of L. intracellularis extracted from PHE-affected mucosa. The efficacy of antimicrobials to inhibit the growth of L. intracellularis in-vitro was evaluated and compared with isolates cultured in the United Kingdom. The results were analysed with respect to medication strategies currently used to control PPE in piggeries. PPE occurs in virtually all piggery management systems, including newly developed systems that are aimed at improving the herd health, such as segregated early weaning and multiple site production. PPE is currently controlled in Australia with the routine addition of antimicrobials in pig feed, in particular <b>olaquindox.</b> Recommendations to reduce the use of feed-based antibiotics in Australia require the development of alternate strategies to control diseases such as PPE. Sequential outbreaks of PHE reported in minimal disease herds suggested that pigs could develop immunity to disease. An experimental model of L. intracellularis infection was developed in this thesis to demonstrate that immunity to re-infection with L. intracellularis could be developed. Infection was monitored by detection of faecal shedding of L. intracellularis and serum IgG antibodies against L. intracellularis. Two in-feed antimicrobial strategies were analysed in this thesis for their ability to induce the development of immunity to L. intracellularis, while avoiding clinical signs of disease. The first strategy evaluated the use of low levels of in-feed antimicrobials to allow subclinical infection and the development of immunity. The second strategy evaluated the use of high levels of in-feed antimicrobials to terminate infection two weeks after exposure to L. intracellularis. Gaining a greater understanding of how L. intracellularis infection is spread both within and between piggeries will enable the development of management strategies to control the spread of infection. This thesis examined the possibility that other species in contact with pigs and piggeries such as rats, mice and birds may transmit infection to pigs. The transmission of infection between pigs via the faecal/oral route was also examined, as was the survival and infectivity of L. intracellularis over time. Ultimately this thesis aimed to understand the pattern of L. intracellularis infection and the survival and transmission of L. intracellularis in order to develop effective control measures for PPE, especially in minimal disease herds...|$|E
40|$|O experimento foi conduzido no Laboratório de Avicultura (LAVIC) do Departamento de Zootecnia da Universidade Federal de Santa Maria - RS, no período de novembro de 2003 a janeiro de 2004, com o objetivo de avaliar o uso de prebióticos, ácidos orgânicos (acidificantes), enzimas e alho (fitoterápico) como {{promotor}}es de crescimento alternativos, em substituição aos convencionais (antibióticos), usualmente utilizados nas dietas para frangos de corte. Foram usados 480 pintos de corte, machos, com um dia de vida, da linhagem Cobb 500, os quais foram submetidos a seis tratamentos experimentais: T 1 = Dieta Base (DB) sem adição de promotor de crescimento; T 2 = DB com 0, 1 % de alho em pó; T 3 = DB com 0, 2 % de alho em pó; T 4 = DB com Bacitracina de Zinco (10 g/ton) e <b>Olaquindox</b> (70 g/ton); T 5 = DB com prebiótico (mananoligossacarídeos (MOS)) e acidificante orgânico (ácido fórmico (50 %) + ácido propiônico (50 %)) e T 6 = DB com prebiótico (mananoligossacarídeos (MOS)) e complexo enzimático (proteases, amilases e celulases). Os níveis utilizados de prebióticos, acidificantes e enzimas foram obtidos através das recomendações técnicas dos produtos comerciais usados. Foram usados 24 boxes experimentais de 1, 5 X 1, 5 m, contendo 20 aves cada, com quatro repetições por tratamento, distribuídos num delineamento experimental inteiramente casualizado. As aves foram alojadas em cama de maravalha reutilizada, num galpão de alvenaria, alimentadas com ração isonutritiva, à base de milho e farelo de soja, fornecida à vontade e dividida em três fases: inicial (1 - 21 dias), contendo 22 % PB e 3050 Kcal de EM/Kg, crescimento (22 - 35 dias) com 20 % PB e 3100 Kcal EM/Kg e final (36 - 43 dias) com 18, 5 % de PB e 3150 Kcal EM/Kg. Os tratamentos não apresentaram diferença estatística nos parâmetros de: ganho de peso (GP) e fator de produção (FP). Para o consumo de ração (CR), não se observaram diferenças significativas nas fases de 1 - 21 e 22 - 35 dias, mas na fase de 36 - 43 dias verificou-se efeito significativo (P 0, 05). A conversão alimentar das aves submetidas aos demais tratamentos (T 2, T 3 e T 5) não diferiram entre si (P> 0, 05). Os resultados referentes à altura de vilos intestinais e rendimento de carcaça não apresentaram efeitos significativos (P> 0, 05) entre os diferentes promotores de crescimento avaliados. Com base nos resultados obtidos, levando em consideração as condições em que o experimento foi conduzido, conclui-se que os promotores de crescimento alternativos testados são uma opção aos antibióticos. Os promotores de crescimento alternativos testados não afetaram negativamente as características de carcaça e morfometria intestinal dos frangos de corte. The {{experiment was}} conducted at the Laboratory of Poultry (LAVIC) of the Department of Animal Science at Federal University of Santa Maria - RS, from November of 2003 to January of 2004 aiming {{to evaluate the use}} of prebiotics, organic acids (acidifiers), enzymes and garlic (phytotherapeutic) as alternative growth promoters, instead of the conventionals (antibiotics) commonly used in broilers feed. The amount of 480 males, day old, Cobb chicks were used, which were submitted to six experimental treatments: T 1 = Basic Diet (BD) without any growth promoters; T 2 = BD with 0. 1 % of garlic in powder; T 3 = BD with 0. 2 % of garlic in powder; T 4 = BD with antibiotics (Zinc Bacitracina (10 g/ton) and <b>Olaquindox</b> (70 g/ton);T 5 = BD with prebiotic (mananoligossacarídeos(MOS)) and acidifier (fórmic acids (50 %) + propionic acids (50 %) and T 6 = BD whit prebiotic (mananoligossacarídeos(MOS)) and enzymes. The amount of prebiotic, acidifier and enzymes used were rated by the technical advise of the commercial products used. Twenty four experimental boxes of the 1. 5 X 1. 5 m, with 20 fowls each were used, with four replicates by treatment in a completely randomized design. The fowls were sheltered on reutilized bed wood shavings, in a mansory shed raised with animal feed based on corn and soy bean meal, ad libitum, isonutritives and divided in three phases: initial (1 - 21 days) bearing 22 % Crude Protein (CP) and 3050 Kcal ME/Kg, growth (22 - 35 days) with 20 % CP and 3100 Kcal ME/Kg, final (36 - 43 days) with 18. 5 % of CP and 3150 Kcal ME/Kg. The treatments did not show any statistic difference for the parameters: weigh gain (WG) and production factor (PF). There wasnt a significant effect on the feed intake (FI), in the phases of 1 - 21 and 22 - 35 days of live, but in the phase of 36 - 43 days there was a significant effect (P 0. 05) in the phases of 1 - 21 and 36 - 43 days of live the fowls. The phase of 22 - 35 days to come different significant (P 0. 05). In the period of 1 - 43 days, the fowls submitted to treatment with antibiotics (T 4) showed better feed conversion (FC) and it was statistically relevant (P 0. 05). The feed conversion (FC) of the fowls submitted to the other treatments (T 2, T 3 and T 5) did not differ statiscally (P> 0. 05). The results according to the intestinal morphology and carcass yield did not show significant effects (P> 0. 05) between the different growth promoters tested. Based on the results obtained, taking in to account the conditions of what the experiment was conducted, it was concluded that the alternative growth promoters tested did not affect negatively the characteristics of the intestinal morphology of the broilers validating them as substitutes to the conventional promoters...|$|E
40|$|The {{reduction}} in feed intake and growth rate that occurs following weaning is of major economic consequence to the pig industry. Currently, {{a range of}} antimicrobial products {{can be used to}} minimise the impact of weaning on piglet health and subsequent performance. However, the use of these products in pig diets is subject to increasing restriction worldwide because of perceived risks to public health and to the environment. Thus, alternative methods are required to mitigate the growth check that almost invariably occurs after weaning in most production systems. Piglets produced outdoors are claimed to experience less of a growth check at weaning {{and to be able to}} thrive in relatively unsophisticated weaner accommodation. However, these claims have not been substantiated under Western Australian conditions, nor a scientific basis for these claims established. Consequently, a series of experiments was designed to test the general hypothesis for this thesis – ‘the gut structure and function, and lifetime performance of the weaned pig are affected by its pre- and post-weaning rearing environments’. Experiment 1 was conducted in two parts to quantify differences in the growth performance, health and gut structure of weaner pigs produced indoors or outdoors and reared in conventional or deep-litter pens. The weaner diet in the first part of the experiment contained 100 ppm of <b>olaquindox</b> and 3, 000 ppm of zinc oxide (Exp 1 a). This experiment was repeated without using dietary antimicrobial products (Exp 1 b). Experiment 2 was conducted in conventional buildings to examine the effect of exposing piglets in lactation to similar substrates to those available to outdoor piglets used in Exp 1 a and Exp 1 b in the absence of other differences in the outdoor production milieu. Pre-weaning environments in Exp 1 a (indoor production (IP) and outdoor production (OP)) appeared to have little effect on gut structure and overall growth rate but significantly affected carcass composition, whereas post-weaning environments (conventional (C) or deep-litter (DL)) affected both overall growth rate and carcass composition. Although feed disappearance was similar, OP pigs grew faster than IP pigs in the first 47 d after weaning in Exp 1 a but not in Exp 1 b. Lifetime growth rate (GR), P 2 backfat, feed disappearance and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were not significantly affected by the production environment in Exp 1 a whereas OP pigs grew slower with higher P 2 backfat and FCR in Exp 1 b. Interestingly, OP pigs had heavier carcass weights and higher dressing percentages than IP pigs in both parts of the experiment. The effects of post-weaning environment were more consistent as DL pigs grew faster, were fatter, and had higher carcass weights and dressing percentages than C pigs. Villus height and crypt depth of IP and OP pigs were not different at 21 (weaning) or 28 d, but villus height decreased and crypt depth increased in the week after weaning. Pigs reared in C pens had greater faecal concentrations of volatile fatty acids than pigs in DL, indicating that the latter ingested sufficient straw to alter fermentation characteristics. In Experiment 2, there were no differences in gut structure or pre-weaning and lifetime GR of pigs offered no creep feed (NC), a commercial creep feed (CF) or an ‘outdoor’ mix (OM) comprising of 1 part straw, 5 parts sow feed and 25 parts of soil taken from paddocks in which OP pigs used in Exp 1 a and Exp 1 b were farrowed. However, NC pigs grew slower in the week after weaning than the other two treatments. Backfat and feed disappearance were similar for all treatments but pigs on the OM treatment had higher carcass weights and dressing percentages than pigs on the NC and CF treatments. Villus height and crypt depth were not different between treatments and, although the piglets were weaned at 28 d, villus height decreased and crypt depth increased in the week after weaning to an extent similar to that experienced by piglets weaned at 21 d in Experiment 1. Although all piglets received intramuscular injections of 200 mg iron (Fe) dextran when 1 to 2 days old, piglets offered the OM during lactation had higher serum iron and blood haemoglobin (Hb) levels than those offered NC or CF. Furthermore, half the piglets offered NC or CF had Hb levels indicative of chronic Fe deficiency anaemia. The average parity of sows used in this experiment was 6. 3 litters, suggesting that piglets may have been born with low Fe stores, possibly because of low Fe stores in their dams due to sub-optimal mineral nutrition over successive parities. In summary, the findings from these experiments partly supported the general hypothesis for this thesis. Under the conditions of these experiments, access to outdoor substrates in lactation had little effect on gut structure and lifetime growth rate but increased both carcass weight and dressing percentage, whereas rearing in DL pens increased feed intake, FCR, growth rate, P 2 backfat, carcass weight and dressing percentage...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to set a {{benchmark}} for a monitoring and surveillance programme on the volumes of the eighteen classes of antimicrobials available and consumed by animals {{for the benefit of}} animal health in South Africa. In setting up such a programme, risk assessment and possible management and communication strategies of the potential health risks emanating from antimicrobial resistance in bacteria from animals and man were considered and the survey was compared with other overseas surveillance programmes established in Sweden, Denmark, the United Kingdom and Australia. The aim {{of the study was to}} contribute to the establishment of future surveillance programmes that will provide direction for the prudent and rational use of antimicrobials, involving all the relevant stake-holders, in order to preserve the future efficacy of those antimicrobials that are currently available. Such programmes will harmonize with international initiatives and contribute to the provision of databases for policy recommendations in South Africa. There are several benefits to the implementation of such surveys and addressing topical and relevant issues of antimicrobial use in the domain of animal health and its possible impact on human health. Furthermore, policy decisions to address concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance may be reached in a more informed and judicious manner, with the aim that the efficacy of available antimicrobials may be preserved for use in future generations of humans and animals. The authorized antimicrobials available in South Africa were firstly reviewed and compared with the volumes of antimicrobials supplied by the veterinary pharmaceutical companies. The majority of antimicrobials were registered under the Stock Remedies Act 36 of 1947. It was found that the class of antimicrobial representing the most registered products was the tetracyclines, followed by the penicillins, the sulphonamides, macrolides, lincosamides and pleuromutilins. This correlated well with the volumes of antimicrobials supplied, as these classes of antimicrobials also represented the top four groups of antimicrobials consumed. Eight of the pool of twenty-five veterinary pharmaceutical companies approached provided more detailed information on the volumes of antimicrobials consumed for the years under review, namely 2002 to 2004. The potency of antimicrobials was also requested, in order to establish trends of increasing or decreasing potency of the active ingredients, versus the volumes of antimicrobials supplied. It was established within the scope of this study, that the majority of consumed antimicrobials was from the classes of macrolides, lincosamides, and pleuromutilins, followed by the tetracycline class, the sulphonamide group and fourthly the penicillins. The potency of the active ingredients supplied by the companies did not change and therefore had no impact on the interpretation of antimicrobials consumed. These results give cause for concern in terms of the possibility of cross-resistance between antimicrobials used in the domain of animal health, and those used in the human medical field. There is also another concern, namely the exposure of humans to veterinary drug residues in food, causing modifications in the bacterial ecology of the human gut, thereby leading to a possible perturbation in the protective human gut barrier with overgrowth and invasion of pathogenic bacteria. Although much has been written about the possibility of anaphylactic reactions occurring in sensitized human individuals from â-lactams and macrolides administered in food animals, this issue has been reviewed extensively and it has been concluded that allergies from antimicrobial residues in the diet are extremely rare. The macrolide tylosin was the most extensively sold antimicrobial of all. Tylosin is one of four antimicrobials that was banned by the EU in 1999 because of its structural relatedness to therapeutic antimicrobials used for the treatment of disease in human medicine. The other three classes mentioned above, the penicillins, tetracyclines and sulphonamides are also relevant because of well-documented evidence of the ability to select for resistance or because of their structural relatedness to human therapeutic antimicrobials and their use in humans. The value of sales of antimicrobials were provided by SAAHA (South Africa Animal Health Association) and also scrutinized within the context of this study in order to obtain meaningful data on the national consumption of antimicrobials. However, as discussed in Chapter 5, the data were not of any value within the context of this study because the sales data were provided in monitory terms only. Volumes of sales of feed were also obtained and companies that mix feed approached to ascertain the percentages of antimicrobial medicated feeds consumed. It was ascertained in this survey that 68, 5 % of the grand total of antimicrobials surveyed during 2002 to 2004, were administered as in-feed medications. Tylosin was the most extensively used in-feed antimicrobial, followed by oxytetracycline, zinc bacitracin and <b>olaquindox.</b> This result emphasizes the importance of establishing a monitoring programme for the volumes of antimicrobials used, as many growth promoters used in-feed are administered at sub-therapeutic levels over long periods of time that tend to select for antimicrobial resistance. Whereas 17, 5 % of the total volume of antimicrobials utilized were parenteral antimicrobials, antimicrobials for water medication constituted 12 % of the total. “Other” dosage forms such as the topical, aural, ophthalmic, and aerosol antimicrobials and intra-uterine pessaries and tablets constituted 1, 5 % of the total. Intramammary antimicrobials represented 0, 04 % of the total. In Chapters 1, 5 & 6 the surveillance systems for veterinary antimicrobials used by other countries are discussed and compared. It was concluded that a combination of the surveillance systems applied by Australia and the United Kingdom is the best model (with modifications) to apply to the animal health situation in South Africa. Such a surveillance system of the volumes of veterinary antimicrobials consumed should ideally be implemented in conjunction with a veterinary antimicrobial resistance surveillance and monitoring programme to generate meaningful data that will contribute to the rational use of antimicrobials in order to preserve the efficacy of the existing antimicrobials in South Africa. Possible trends of antimicrobial usage in animals may be uncovered over time from implementing a programme for the volumes of antimicrobials used and thereby lead to proactive application of rational policies for the veterinary use of antimicrobials. This information can also be compared with international data, in order to harmonize as much as possible with global monitoring programmes of veterinary antimicrobial usage.
