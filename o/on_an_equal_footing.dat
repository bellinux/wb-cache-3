5|$|Soon, blue whales {{were being}} hunted off Iceland (1883), the Faroe Islands (1894), Newfoundland (1898), and Spitsbergen (1903). In 1904–05 the first blue whales were taken off South Georgia. By 1925, {{with the advent}} of the stern slipway in factory ships and the use of steam-driven whale catchers, the catch of blue whales, and baleen whales as a whole, in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic began to {{increase}} dramatically. In the 1930–31 season, these ships caught 29,400 blue whales in the Antarctic alone. By the end of World War II, populations had been significantly depleted, and, in 1946, the first quotas restricting international trade in whales were introduced, but they were ineffective because of the lack of differentiation between species. Rare species could be hunted <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>equal</b> <b>footing</b> with those found in relative abundance.|$|E

5|$|From the 13th century onwards, the Court of Common Pleas could issue its own writs, {{and was not}} {{dependent}} on the Court of Chancery, where such documents usually originated. These were sealed with the Great Seal of the King until at least 1338, along with the seal of the justices; the Chancery writs had their own independent seal. Documents were, from 1350, considered acceptable if only marked with the seal of the justices. In 1344, the king created a separate seal for the Common Pleas, allowing them to process cases without involving the Chancery or the king. The court stood <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>equal</b> <b>footing</b> with the Exchequer of Pleas, Court of Chancery and King's Bench in relation to transferring cases between them. Any errors {{on the part of}} the Common Pleas would be corrected by the King's Bench through a separate action brought there. Thanks to the Bill of Middlesex and other legal fictions, the King's Bench gained much of the Common Pleas's jurisdiction, although the Common Pleas remained the sole place where real property claims could be brought.|$|E
5|$|On 19 December 1914, Abbas Helmi II was deposed by the United Kingdom {{while he}} was on a visit to Vienna due to his anti-British stance. The British severed Egypt's nominal ties to the Ottoman Empire, thus ending the country's status as a khedivate. Prime Minister Hussein Rushdi Pasha served as acting head of state until Abbas Helmi II's half-uncle Hussein Kamel was chosen as the country's new monarch. For a brief while, the British had {{considered}} putting an end to the Muhammad Ali Dynasty and installing Aga Khan III as ruler. Hussein Kamel took the title of Sultan of Egypt (preceded by the untranslatable style of Sa Hautesse), thereby putting him <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>equal</b> <b>footing</b> with the Ottoman Sultan. However, the end of nominal Ottoman suzerainty over Egypt did not result in genuine independence; the Sultanate of Egypt was a British protectorate where real power lay in the hand of the High Commissioner.|$|E
5|$|While pre-dreadnoughts {{were adopted}} worldwide, {{there were no}} clashes between pre-dreadnought battleships {{until the very end}} of their period of dominance. The First Sino-Japanese War in 1894–95 {{influenced}} pre-dreadnought development, but this had been a clash between Chinese battleships and a Japanese fleet consisting of mostly cruisers. The Spanish–American War of 1898 was also a mismatch, with the American pre-dreadnought fleet engaging Spanish cruisers.

These battles upended prevailing theories of how naval battles would be fought, as the fleets began firing at one another at much greater distances than before; naval architects realized that plunging fire (explosive shells falling on their targets largely from above, instead of from a trajectory close to horizontal) was a much greater threat than had been thought.|$|E

5|$|States are {{the primary}} subdivisions of the United States, and possess a number of powers and rights under the United States Constitution, such as {{regulating}} intrastate commerce, running elections, creating local governments, and ratifying constitutional amendments. Each state has its own constitution, grounded in republican principles, and government, consisting of three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. All states and their residents are represented in the federal Congress, a bicameral legislature consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Each state is represented by two Senators, while Representatives are distributed among the states {{in proportion to the}} most recent constitutionally mandated decennial census. Additionally, each state is entitled to select a number of electors to vote in the Electoral College, the body that elects the President of the United States, equal to the total of Representatives and Senators in Congress from that state. Article IV, Section 3, Clause 1 of the Constitution grants to Congress the authority to admit new states into the Union. Since the establishment of the United States in 1776, the number of states has expanded from the original 13 to the current total of 50, and each new state is admitted <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>equal</b> <b>footing</b> with the existing states.|$|E
5|$|The Exchequer stood <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>equal</b> <b>footing</b> {{with the}} other Westminster courts (the Court of Common Pleas, Court of King's Bench and Court of Chancery), with cases {{transferred}} easily from one to another, although there were problems {{in the case of}} the Court of King's Bench. The traditional method for moving a case was the writ of supersedeas, but the King's Bench represented the monarch, who could not have writs placed against him. Instead, a clerk would bring the Red Book of the Exchequer to the King's Bench and assert that the case's claimant was an officer of the Exchequer, necessitating his trial there rather than in the King's Bench. The Exchequer maintained a clear rule {{with the other}} equity court, the Court of Chancery; a case heard in one could not be re-heard in the other. Apart from that, cases of equity could be heard by either court. The Exchequer had superior status over inferior courts of equity, able to take cases from them and countermand their decisions. The jurisdiction of ecclesiastical courts also overlapped with that of the Exchequer, particularly in relation to the collection of tithes, and there are many records of disputes between the two.|$|E
