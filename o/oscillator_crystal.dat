5000|$|The {{clock rate}} of a CPU is {{normally}} {{determined by the}} frequency of an <b>oscillator</b> <b>crystal.</b> Typically a crystal oscillator produces a fixed sine wave—the frequency reference signal. Electronic circuitry translates that into a square wave at the same frequency for digital electronics applications (or, in using a CPU multiplier, some fixed multiple of the crystal reference frequency). The clock distribution network inside the CPU carries that clock signal to all the parts that need it. An A/D Converter has a [...] "clock" [...] pin driven by a similar system to set the sampling rate. With any particular CPU, replacing the crystal with another crystal that oscillates half the frequency ("underclocking") will generally make the CPU run at half the performance and reduce waste heat produced by the CPU. Conversely, some people try to increase performance of a CPU by replacing the <b>oscillator</b> <b>crystal</b> with a higher frequency crystal ("overclocking"). However, the amount of overclocking {{is limited by the}} time for the CPU to settle after each pulse, and by the extra heat created.|$|E

5000|$|In a <b>crystal</b> <b>oscillator</b> circuit {{the filter}} is a {{piezoelectric}} crystal (commonly a quartz crystal). [...] The crystal mechanically vibrates as a resonator, and its frequency of vibration determines the oscillation frequency. Crystals have very high Q-factor and also better temperature stability than tuned circuits, so <b>crystal</b> <b>oscillators</b> have much better frequency stability than LC or RC <b>oscillators.</b> <b>Crystal</b> <b>oscillators</b> {{are the most}} common type of linear oscillator, used to stabilize the frequency of most radio transmitters, and to generate the clock signal in computers and quartz clocks. <b>Crystal</b> <b>oscillators</b> often use the same circuits as LC <b>oscillators,</b> with the <b>crystal</b> replacing the tuned circuit; the Pierce oscillator circuit is also commonly used. Quartz crystals are generally limited to frequencies of 30 MHz or below. [...] Other types of resonator, dielectric resonators and surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices, are used to control higher frequency oscillators, up into the microwave range. For example, SAW oscillators are used to generate the radio signal in cell phones.|$|R
50|$|Some other {{piezoelectric}} materials than quartz can be employed. These include single crystals of lithium tantalate, lithium niobate, lithium borate, berlinite, gallium arsenide, lithium tetraborate, aluminium phosphate, bismuth germanium oxide, polycrystalline zirconium titanate ceramics, high-alumina ceramics, silicon-zinc oxide composite, or dipotassium tartrate. Some materials may be {{more suitable}} for specific applications. An <b>oscillator</b> <b>crystal</b> can be also manufactured by depositing the resonator material on the silicon chip surface. Crystals of gallium phosphate, langasite, langanite and langanate are about 10 times more pullable than the corresponding quartz crystals, and are used in some VCXO oscillators.|$|E
50|$|An <b>oscillator</b> <b>crystal</b> has two {{electrically}} conductive plates, with a slice or tuning fork of quartz crystal sandwiched between them. During startup, the controlling circuit places the crystal into an unstable equilibrium, {{and due to}} the positive feedback in the system, any tiny fraction of noise is amplified, ramping up the oscillation. The crystal resonator {{can also be seen}} as a highly frequency-selective filter in this system: it only passes a very narrow subband of frequencies around the resonant one, attenuating everything else. Eventually, only the resonant frequency is active. As the oscillator amplifies the signals coming out of the crystal, the signals in the crystal's frequency band becomes stronger, eventually dominating the output of the oscillator. The narrow resonance band of the quartz crystal filters out all the unwanted frequencies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Due {{to their}} high Q and temperature-stable properties, quartz crystal {{oscillators}} are important clock sources in consumer, commercial, industrial, and military products for many years. The demand for quartz crystals and crystal oscillators {{has been increasing}} steadily between 4 and 10 % annually since the “dotcom ” market collapse in 2000 ~ 2001. The total market for 2008 is expected to exceed $ 4. 1 B. The quartz crystal and crystal oscillator industry has made major progresses in miniaturization, performance enhancement, and cost reduction {{in the past ten}} years. The unique fabrication and encapsulation requirements though render quartz crystals and crystal oscillators difficult or close to impossible to be integrated onto the silicon-based IC platforms. The recent strong marketing push of the all silicon MEMS resonators and oscillators seemed to re-ignite the interest in displacing the quartz crystal technology and to open up again the prospect in clock source integration. Based on a 2006 review paper,[1] the author expands on the subject by reviewing the development of the all silicon MEMS oscillators and crystal oscillators {{in the past few years}} and commenting on what challenges they face in the highly competitive frequency control products industry. Since information on the technical development of the all silicon MEMS oscillators and crystal oscillators is abundantly and readily available, this paper addresses more on the market and business aspects. This paper also touches on the recent development of piezoelectric-activated silicon MEMS resonators and oscillators and all silicon oscillators (with no moving parts).

40|$|Ho:YLF is an {{attractive}} laser material for 2 µm high energy sources since it has a much longer upper laser level lifetime (~ 14 ms) and higher emission cross section than Ho:YAG. In addition, the very weak thermal lens on the -polarisation helps to deliver diffraction limited beams even under intense end-pumping. However, Ho:YLF has a somewhat stronger quasi-three-level nature, which implies {{that in order to}} reach transparency at the 2065 nm line, 22 % of the Ho ions need to be pumped into the upper laser level (at room temperature), but it already reaches transparency at the 1940 nm pump wavelength with only 56 % of the Ho ions in the upper laser level. In addition, the pump absorption cross section at 1940 nm is relatively low and strongly polarised. Therefore, the laser design requires a trade-off between efficient pump absorption and low laser threshold. Efficient fibre-laser-pumped Ho:YLF oscillators have previously been demonstrated [1], but to scale the output energy further, an oscillator-amplifier system can be employed. The traditional approach when pumping an oscillator-amplifier system with one fibre laser pump source is to split the unpolarised pump beam into two polarised beams in order to pump the oscillator and amplifier crystals separately [2]. In our novel approach, we used the full unpolarised pump beam from our 82 W Tm-fibre laser to pump a relatively short <b>oscillator</b> <b>crystal</b> (30 mm long, 0. 5 % doped), which absorbs roughly half the pump power under lasing conditions, mainly on its -polarisation.

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} traits of quartz <b>crystal</b> <b>oscillators</b> is that they can exhibit very low phase noise.In many oscillators, any spectral energy at the resonant frequency is amplified by the oscillator, resulting in a collection of tones at different phases.In a <b>crystal</b> <b>oscillator,</b> the <b>crystal</b> mostly vibrates in one axis, therefore only one phase is dominant.This property of low phase noise makes them particularly useful in telecommunications where stable signals are needed, and in scientific equipment where very precise time references are needed.|$|R
