5|$|The {{computational}} {{efficiency of}} Euclid's algorithm {{has been studied}} thoroughly. This efficiency can be described by the number <b>of</b> <b>division</b> steps the algorithm requires, multiplied by the computational expense of each step. The first known analysis of Euclid's algorithm is due to A. A. L. Reynaud in 1811, who showed that the number <b>of</b> <b>division</b> steps on input (u, v) is bounded by v; later he improved this to v/2 +2. Later, in 1841, P. J. E. Finck showed that the number <b>of</b> <b>division</b> steps is at most 2log2v+1, and hence Euclid's algorithm runs in time polynomial {{in the size of}} the input. Émile Léger, in 1837, studied the worst case, which is when the inputs are consecutive Fibonacci numbers. Finck's analysis was refined by Gabriel Lamé in 1844, who showed that the number of steps required for completion is never more than five times the number h of base-10 digits of the smaller numberb.|$|E
