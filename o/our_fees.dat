40|$|We are {{not paid}} to do what’s best. Most {{physicians}} work in a fee-for-service model, where we get paid for individual tasks. This is true of lawyers, dentists, and many other professionals. The difference for physicians is that <b>our</b> <b>fees</b> in Canada are set provincially, and there is lit-tle if any leeway for individual considerations. As a profes-sion, physicians are apparently in the top 2 % of Canadians in terms of earnings. We may work more hours and take on more responsibility than the average Canadian, but we are still well paid {{at the end of}} the year. The reality, however, is that we do not get paid for the quality of our work; instead, we are paid per volume of tasks, and this has a significant influence on practice. Patients with a chronic disease who have a family doctor use fewer emergency room services and have fewer hospitaliza...|$|E
40|$|As Hawn (2) says, "insurance {{is about}} risk and peace of mind. " She {{reports that the}} American Humane Society {{supports}} pet insurance because companion animals are able to be treated for disease or accidents that are life-threatening where, otherwise, {{they would have been}} euthanized. For veterinarians, she suggests that pet insurance allows them to practice veterinary medicine "as if it were free. " It is inevitable that pet insurance will grow as a recourse for veterinary fees. This may be a savior to some families whose budget is stretched to the limit at a critical moment in the health care of their cherished pet. We in the veterinary profession have an advantage over other professions. We have seen the good, the bad, and the ugly of insurance, as it applies to human health and dental care. If we work hand-in-hand with our own industries, collectively {{we may be able to}} develop a system that wins for everyone, with fees that allow practice to thrive and growth strategies that accommodate new treatment and diagnostic modalities, as well as consistent and exemplary customer service. The path ahead is always fraught with bumps and potholes. We can be a passive passenger and become a victim of the times or an active driver to steer the profession to a clearer route. Pet insurance is but one of the solutions for the profession; the others are a careful assessment of <b>our</b> <b>fees</b> [...] charging what we are worth, not what we think the client will pay; business management; customer service; leadership of our health care team; lifelong learning; and more efficient delivery systems.

30|$|The FEE {{properties}} of the MWCNTs grown on both pyramidally textured (with various AR values) and flat silicon (used as a reference sample having AR value of zero) substrates were systematically characterized in <b>our</b> <b>FEE</b> measurement setup, which {{is equipped with a}} high-precision translation stage that positions the MWCNT emitters at 100 ± 0.4 μm from the upper copper collecting electrode. The FEE measurement chamber was pumped down to 5.10 − 6 -Torr base pressure before proceeding with the measurements. An increasing voltage was then applied from 0 up to 400 V, and all the samples were cycled several times until a stable FEE regime is reached to allow meaningful comparison between the samples. This cycling of the MWCNT cathodes enables soft and progressive cleaning of the MWCNTs (Collazo et al. [21]).|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{whether and how}} audit quality proxied by the magnitude of absolute discretionary accruals is associated with abnormal audit fees, that is, the difference between actual audit fee and the expected, normal level of audit fee.

For observations with negative abnormal audit fees, there is no significant association between audit quality and abnormal audit fee. In contrast, abnormal audit fees are negatively associated with audit quality for observations with positive abnormal audit <b>fees.</b> <b>Our</b> findings suggest that auditors’ incentives to deter biased financial reporting differ systematically, depending on whether their clients pay more than or less than the normal level of audit <b>fee.</b> <b>Our</b> results are robust to a variety of sensitivity checks...|$|R

40|$|Newborn {{screening}} (NBS) {{programs are}} population-basedpublic health programs and are uniquely financedcompared {{with many other}} public health programs. Since they began more than 45 years ago, the financing issues have become more complex for NBS programs. Today, almost all programs have {{a portion of their}} costs paid by fees. The fee amounts vary from program to program, with little standardization in the way they are formulated, collected, or used. We previously surveyed 37 of the 51 dried blood spot screening programs throughout the United States, and confirmed an increasing dependence on NBS fees. In this study, we have collected responses from all 51 programs (100 %), including updated responses from the original 37, and updated <b>our</b> <b>fee</b> listings. Comments from those surveyed indicated that the lack of a national standardized procedural coding system for NBS contributes to billing complexities. We suggest one coding possibility for discussion and debate for such a system. Differences in Medicaid interpretations may also contribute to financing inequities across NBS programs and there may be benefit from certain clarifications at the national level. Completed survey responses accounted for few changes in the conclusions of our original survey. We confirmed that 90 percent of all NBS programs have a fee paid by parents or a third party payer. Sixty-one percent reported receiving some funds from the Maternal and Child Health Services Title V block grant, 33 percent reported some funding from state general revenue/general public health appropriations; and 24 percent reported obtaining direct reimbursement from Medicaid (without passing through a third party).

40|$|Auditors play an {{important}} role in the reliability of financial statements. Many investors and other financial information users rely on their opinion. During the financial crisis, auditors were critised since they did not warn the markets about financially distressed companies. In our thesis, we examine whether auditors change their behaviour during a financial crisis. Using our collected data for joint stock companies in the Czech Republic, we focus on frequency of modified and going concern opinions, amount of audit and non-audit fees charged by auditors, and audit reporting lag. <b>Our</b> audit <b>fees</b> model showed that there were significantly lower audit fees after the crisis than during the crisis years. The results also suggest that both Big 4 and non-Big 4 auditors increased their frequency of issuing modified opinions (most of which were going concern opinions) during the crisis period. In our logit going concern models for the individual years we observed change of the auditors' behaviour during the crisis years 2008 - 2010.

40|$|The {{innovations}} {{of information}} technologies {{and the new}} possibilities of multimedia exploitation {{in the realm of}} architectural design and education are supporting the development of image communication methods on the basis of interactivity. The creative process of searching and decision-making in the urban design studio of our Faculty is supported by spatial modelling methods. The draft is sketched in modelling material on a working model. From the didactic point of view, relevant are mainly those phases, in which is possible, in the imaginative way, to support the searching and decision making process with the aim to test, compare and continuously evaluate the fulfillment of the hypothetic intentions of the solution responsibilities. The model becomes an interactive medium of cooperation between teacher and the working group of students. From the view of design crystallization, the dominant phases, in the creative process, are examining, verification, and simulation. The alternatives of material-compositional content and the spatial performance charts of modeled physical structure are verifying and the visual experience of the anticipated urban environment is simulated by the author, but also through the future clientis eyes. The alternation of the compositionis spatial configurations is generally appreciated by the static visual verification in the endoscopic horizon like the architectural spatial studies. The effective method of the progress generates a creative atmosphere for the generative thinking and design. The laboratory simulation of spatial experiences and their evaluation is performed following the perception psychology relations. The simulation of digestion of the new spatial reality intervenes the customeris identification and guides to subjective approaches towards the quality and complexity of the formed environment. The simulation is performed in motion {{in order to be able}} to anticipate the dynamic continuity of subjective spatial imagination. The induced atmosphere will direct the evaluational attitudes of authors on comparison and selection of the successful alternatives. In <b>our</b> <b>fee,</b> we will present the demonstrations of selected static and dynamic notations of image sequences prepared in our laboratory. The presentations have been created in order to analyze, verify and offer imaginative support to creative findings in result of fulfilling the studio design tasks in the educational process. The main one is the design of urban spatial structures. The laboratory methodology is in the first place oriented on the analogue-digital procedures of “endoscope” model simulation. At the same time it also explores and looks for new unconventional forms of visual communication or archiving as imagination support to specialist and laymen participants in creative, valorization and approval processes...|$|R
