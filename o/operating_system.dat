5|$|DOS (Disk <b>Operating</b> <b>System)</b> was the <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> {{that brought}} the company its real success. IBM first {{approached}} Microsoft about its upcoming IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC) in July 1980. On August 12, 1981, after negotiations with Digital Research failed, IBM awarded a contract to Microsoft to provide {{a version of the}} CP/M <b>operating</b> <b>system,</b> which was set {{to be used in the}} IBM PC. For this deal, Microsoft purchased a CP/M clone called 86-DOS from Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products for less than US$100,000, which IBM renamed to IBM PC DOS. Microsoft did not have an <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> when they closed the deal with IBM and IBM had not done their homework. Due to potential copyright infringement problems with CP/M, IBM marketed both CP/M and PC DOS for US$240 and US$40, respectively, with PC DOS eventually becoming the standard because of its lower price. 35 of the company's 100 employees worked on the IBM project for more than a year. When the IBM PC debuted, Microsoft was the only company that offered <b>operating</b> <b>system,</b> programming language, and application software for the new computer.|$|E

5|$|In 1980, Microsoft {{formed a}} {{partnership}} with IBM to bundle Microsoft's <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> with IBM computers, paying Microsoft a royalty for every sale. In 1985, IBM requested that Microsoft write a new <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> for their computers called OS/2. Microsoft wrote the <b>operating</b> <b>system,</b> but also continued to sell their own alternative, which proved to be in direct competition with OS/2. Microsoft Windows eventually overshadowed OS/2 in terms of sales. When Microsoft launched several versions of Microsoft Windows in the 1990s, they had captured over 90% market share of the world's personal computers.|$|E

5|$|Some {{mainframe}} {{games that}} did not appear in 101 BASIC Computer Games have still had a lasting impact. One such game was Space Travel, developed by Ken Thompson in 1969, which simulates travel in the Solar System. The player flies their ship around a two-dimensional scale model {{of the solar system}} with no objectives other than to attempt to land on various planets and moons. The player can move and turn the ship, and adjust the overall speed by adjusting the scale of the simulation. The ship is affected by the single strongest gravitational pull of the astronomical bodies. The game was developed at Bell Labs, and was ported during 1969 from the Multics <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> to the GECOS <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> on the GE 635 computer, and then to the PDP-7 minicomputer.
