5|$|Miller's Language and Communication {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{significant}} texts in the study <b>of</b> <b>language</b> behavior. The book was a scientific study <b>of</b> <b>language,</b> emphasizing quantitative data, and was based on the mathematical model of Claude Shannon's information theory. It used a probabilistic model imposed on a learning-by-association scheme borrowed from behaviorism, with Miller not yet attached to a pure cognitive perspective. The first part of the book reviewed information theory, the physiology and acoustics of phonetics, speech recognition and comprehension, and statistical techniques to analyze language. The focus was more on speech generation than recognition. The second part had the psychology: idiosyncratic differences across people in language use; developmental linguistics; the structure of word associations in people; use of symbolism in language; and social aspects <b>of</b> <b>language</b> use.|$|E
5|$|Some {{proponents of}} Saussure's view <b>of</b> <b>language</b> have {{advocated}} a formal approach which studies language structure by identifying its basic elements {{and then by}} presenting a formal account of the rules according to which the elements combine in order to form words and sentences. The main proponent of such a theory is Noam Chomsky, the originator of the generative theory of grammar, who has defined language as the construction of sentences that can be generated using transformational grammars. Chomsky considers these rules to be an innate feature {{of the human mind}} and to constitute the rudiments of what language is. By way of contrast, such transformational grammars are also commonly used to provide formal definitions <b>of</b> <b>language</b> are commonly used in formal logic, in formal theories of grammar, and in applied computational linguistics. In the philosophy <b>of</b> <b>language,</b> the view of linguistic meaning as residing in the logical relations between propositions and reality was developed by philosophers such as Alfred Tarski, Bertrand Russell, and other formal logicians.|$|E
5|$|The {{academic}} study <b>of</b> <b>language</b> {{is conducted}} within many different disciplinary areas and from different theoretical angles, {{all of which}} inform modern approaches to linguistics. For example, descriptive linguistics examines the grammar of single languages, theoretical linguistics develops theories {{on how best to}} conceptualize and define the nature <b>of</b> <b>language</b> based on data from the various extant human languages, sociolinguistics studies how languages are used for social purposes informing in turn the study of the social functions <b>of</b> <b>language</b> and grammatical description, neurolinguistics studies how language is processed in the human brain and allows the experimental testing of theories, computational linguistics builds on theoretical and descriptive linguistics to construct computational models <b>of</b> <b>language</b> often aimed at processing natural language or at testing linguistic hypotheses, and historical linguistics relies on grammatical and lexical descriptions of languages to trace their individual histories and reconstruct trees <b>of</b> <b>language</b> families by using the comparative method.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} classes <b>of</b> <b>languages</b> <b>of</b> overlapping tiles, i. e., subsets of the McAlister monoid: {{the class}} REG <b>of</b> <b>languages</b> definable by Kleene’s regular expressions, the class MSO <b>of</b> <b>languages</b> definable by formulas of monadic second-order logic, {{and the class}} REC <b>of</b> <b>languages</b> definable by morphisms into finite monoids. By extending the semantics of finite-state two-way au- tomata (possibly with pebbles) from <b>languages</b> <b>of</b> words to <b>languages</b> <b>of</b> tiles, we obtain a complete characterization of the classes REG and MSO.

5|$|The {{scientific}} study <b>of</b> <b>language</b> is called linguistics. Questions concerning the philosophy <b>of</b> <b>language,</b> {{such as whether}} words can represent experience, have been debated since Gorgias and Plato in ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy is really the study <b>of</b> <b>language.</b> Major figures in linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky.|$|E
5|$|The study <b>of</b> <b>language,</b> linguistics, {{has been}} {{developing}} into a science since the first grammatical descriptions of particular languages in India more than 2000 years ago, after {{the development of the}} Brahmi script.

5|$|This view <b>of</b> <b>language</b> is {{associated}} with the study <b>of</b> <b>language</b> in pragmatic, cognitive, and interactive frameworks, as well as in sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology. Functionalist theories tend to study grammar as dynamic phenomena, as structures that are always in the process of changing as they are employed by their speakers. This view places importance on the study of linguistic typology, or the classification of languages according to structural features, as it can be shown that processes of grammaticalization tend to follow trajectories that are partly dependent on typology. In the philosophy <b>of</b> <b>language,</b> the view of pragmatics as being central to language and meaning is often associated with Wittgenstein's later works and with ordinary language philosophers such as J. L. Austin, Paul Grice, John Searle, and W. O. Quine.|$|E

5|$|When {{speaking}} <b>of</b> <b>language</b> as {{a general}} concept, definitions can be used which stress {{different aspects of the}} phenomenon. These definitions also entail different approaches and understandings <b>of</b> <b>language,</b> and they also inform different and often incompatible schools of linguistic theory. Debates about the nature and origin <b>of</b> <b>language</b> go back to the ancient world. Greek philosophers such as Gorgias and Plato debated the relation between words, concepts and reality. Gorgias argued that language could represent neither the objective experience nor human experience, and that communication and truth were therefore impossible. Plato maintained that communication is possible because language represents ideas and concepts that exist independently of, and prior to, language.|$|E

5|$|During the Enlightenment and its {{debates about}} human origins, it became fashionable to {{speculate}} about the origin <b>of</b> <b>language.</b> Thinkers such as Rousseau and Herder argued that language had originated in the instinctive expression of emotions, {{and that it was}} originally closer to music and poetry than to the logical expression of rational thought. Rationalist philosophers such as Kant and Descartes held the opposite view. Around the turn of the 20th century, thinkers began to wonder about the role <b>of</b> <b>language</b> in shaping our experiences of the world– asking whether language simply reflects the objective structure of the world, or whether it creates concepts that it in turn imposes on our experience of the objective world. This led {{to the question of whether}} philosophical problems are really firstly linguistic problems. The resurgence of the view that language plays a significant role in the creation and circulation of concepts, and that the study of philosophy is essentially the study <b>of</b> <b>language,</b> is associated with what has been called the linguistic turn and philosophers such as Wittgenstein in 20th-century philosophy.
