40|$|A {{reversible}} CO 2 prototype RAC split {{unit system}} has been designed, built and installed in two calorimetric test chambers. The unit {{is based on the}} Lorentzen Cycle with a receiver and a suction line <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> Both the indoor and the <b>outdoor</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> have tube-in-fin design. The hermetic compressor has two compression stages and is inverter driven. In heat pump mode the CO 2 prototype unit can either operate as a conventional one-stage circuit or as a two-stage system. In air-condition mode, there is an option for cooling of the compressor first stage discharge gas. Experimental tests are under preparation. Realistic simulations have been carried out with the advanced in-house simulation program CSIM using input data for all components of the prototype. CSIM is a steady state circuit simulator (primarily) for trans-critical CO 2 cycles, which uses well calibrated models for all components. A state of the art inverter driven R 410 A split unit has been tested experimentally as a baseline unit. Obtained results have been compared to simulation results for the CO 2 prototype. Results indicate that the prototype CO 2 unit will perform almost equal as the R 410 A baseline unit in AC mode at 27. 8 °C and 35 °C ambient temperature. In heat pump mode, the prototype CO 2 unit is predicted to perform around 30 to 40 % better at – 5 °C and 5 °C ambient temperature. ...|$|R
40|$|In modern {{heat pump}} systems, the <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> use {{enhanced}} <b>heat</b> transfer surfaces for both air and refrigerant sides. In air conditioning applications, conventional 9. 5 mm (3 / 8 inch) tube diameter fin-and-tube coils are slowly {{being replaced by}} microchannel <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers.</b> However, during <b>heating</b> mode the energy performance of heat pump systems with microchannel outdoor coils are generally {{lower than those of}} fin-and-tube direct-expansion evaporators due to a higher frequency of defrost cycles. A different approach might be to utilize fin-and-tube technology, which has proven records of excellent water drainage characteristics and good performance in frosting operating conditions, and enhance the air side heat transfer rates by introducing a larger number of small diameter copper tubes. In this paper, six fin-and-tube coils with copper tube diameter ranging from 5 mm (1 / 5 inch) to 7 mm (8 / 29 inch) were experimentally investigated in frosting operating conditions. The laboratory experiments were conducted in an air flow wind tunnel at Oklahoma State University. Experimental data on heat transfer rate and air-side pressure drop across the coils were measured and the fin density and the tube diameter were varied in a parametric fashion during the experimental campaign. The performance of the fin-and-tube coils were also compared to those of a conventional 9. 5 mm copper tube diameter fin-and-tube <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> and of a microchannel <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> that had similar air-side frontal area and at similar operating conditions of outdoor direct-expansion evaporators in heat pump systems for residential applications. The trends of the data during frosting operation suggested that reducing the tube diameter was beneficial for frosting performance at low fin density while was harmful at high fin density. The data showed that increasing the fin density increased the capacity but significantly reduced the time for heating service for the evaporator. Small copper tube diameter resulted in about 11 % higher initial capacity at dry start conditions and about 4 % higher average integrated capacity when considering the entire frost period. The data discussed in this paper serve as basis for future research on direct-expansion evaporators for air-source heat pump applications, in which the frosting of the <b>outdoor</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> {{is still one of the}} major concerns...|$|R
50|$|When {{the liquid}} {{refrigerant}} {{at a low}} temperature and low pressure passes through the <b>outdoor</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> coils, ambient heat causes the liquid to boil (change to gas or vapor): heat energy from the outside air has been absorbed and stored in the refrigerant as latent heat.

50|$|Air source {{heat pumps}} {{can last for}} over 20 years with low {{maintenance}} requirements. There are numerous heat pumps from the 1970s and 1980s in the United States that are still in service in 2012, even in places where winters are extremely cold. Few moving parts reduce maintenance requirements. However, the <b>outdoor</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> and fan must be kept free from leaves and debris.

50|$|Air-source {{heat pumps}} are more popular in milder winter climates where the {{temperature}} is frequently {{in the range of}} 40-55 °F (4-13 °C), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the <b>outdoor</b> unit's <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. A heat pump system will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.|$|R

A set of empirical correlations were developed to predict the frost thickness on fin leading edge and the reduction of air face velocity due to air pressure drop across the frosted coil during frosting operation. The correlations aid to calculate the instantaneous air-side Reynolds numbers during frosting operation of the fin samples.

Corrosion of air conditioner <b>outdoor</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> (condensers) poses a significant problem for consumers living in coastal regions. This research sought to experimentally determine effects of galvanic corrosion on air conditioner condenser coils when subjected to high salt environments such as those found along the Gulf coast of the southern United States. The particular coil configuration investigated was comprised of copper tubing and aluminum fins, which form a galvanic couple in the presence of an electrolyte (salt water). Corrosion at the tube/fin junction results in a decrease of contact area through which heat is transferred. As a result, degradation of air conditioner performance occurs. An experimental plan was developed to operate two air conditioners for a period of approximately one year at a testing site in Galveston, Texas. Psychrometric evaluation of these units was conducted prior to exposure, at the midpoint of exposure, and at the conclusion of exposure. In addition, samples of copper and aluminum coils and coupons were subjected to the same coastal environment and investigated for corrosion attack. An accelerated corrosion test was also conducted {{to determine the effects of}} increased temperature, relative humidity, and salt concentrations on these samples. Air conditioner performance was measured during steady state cooling tests at outdoor conditions of 75 ?F (23. 9 ?C), 82 ?F (27. 8 ?C), 95 ?F (35. 0 ?C), and 105 ?F (40. 6 ?C) with an indoor temperature of 80 ?F (26. 7 ?C) dry-bulb and 67 ?F (19. 4 ?C) wet-bulb. Results of this testing showed that both units demonstrated average decreases in both cooling capacity and system EER. Sensible and latent capacity degradation for both package units showed decreases of approximately 4. 6 % and 20. 9 % respectively. System EER dropped over the course of the field investigation by 11. 5 % for one of the units and 8. 3 % for the other. An average corrosion rate for sample coupons subjected to the Galveston environment was calculated to be 0. 13 MPY. Microscopic evaluation of aluminum from these galvanic couples after approximately one year of exposure showed an average pit depth approximately 19 % of the aluminum thickness at the material interface. In comparison, aluminum fin collars at the material interface had an average pit about 22 % of the thickness. Accelerated corrosion testing revealed some pitting, but not to the extent exhibited by field samples. A detailed description of the experimental setup, procedure, and results are provided...|$|R

The effects of <b>outdoor</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> hydrophobic treatment on the performance of an air source heat pump were investigated. The base case tests used a bare aluminum <b>outdoor</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> in the experimental setup. The base case test results were compared to tests that utilized coated aluminum outdoor heat exchangers. The overall performance of each test was analyzed. These tests were carried out for cooling and heating mode conditions. The adhesion strength of water droplets to a bare aluminum surface, a silicone resin coated aluminum surface, and an acrylic resin coated aluminum surface were catalogued and compared. The angle at which the water droplet released from the surface was used as the measure of adhesion strength. The adhesion strength was measured through a range of temperatures. At 1. 1 C the adhesion strengths of the droplets were found to be 590 for bare aluminum, 34 ' for acrylic coated aluminum, and 24 ' for silicone coated aluminum. Hence, water droplets would release from the surface quicker for silicone resin surface than for the other two surfaces. The coatings were not found to have any detrimental effects on the cooling performance parameters of the heat pump. For the cooling mode testing condition, the coatings were within 2. 4 % of the base coil for the system EER, power consumption, and the system capacity. For frost/defrost testing conditions, it was generally found that the coated outdoor heat exchangers produced longer frost/defrost cycle times than the base coil. In general, the defrost times were found to be less for the coated coils than the base coil. During the heating mode, the coating did not significantly effect the integrated capacity, integrated total system power consumption, or the integrated cyclic coefficient of performance of the heat pump. Overall, {{the results of this study}} showed that hydrophobically coating the <b>outdoor</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> of a split system heat pump could be used to increase the heating performance by decreasing the frequency of defrost cycles.

Therefore, by inclined way to alleviate or solve this problem, the road or green slope to the building foundation and the surrounding has been paved, neither destroy the building or bridge structure, and can save a lot of buried pipe construction land. The buried heat exchanger can be composed of HDPE tube of multiple sets of double U or single U, heat exchange wells according to different direction and angle are arranged radial. Radial heat exchange wells covers an small area, saves the land resources, high heat exchange efficiency, is a new type of ground source heat pump system of <b>outdoor</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger...</b>|$|E
30|$|The second {{parameter}} is performance. How effective is a {{heat pump}} {{at a given}} outside temperature? Manufacturers often state a heating season performance factor (HSPF), which is the heat provided over the entire heating season in BTUs divided by the electricity consumed in kWh. This factor can be translated into a coefficient of performance (COP), which is usually used to measure instantaneous performance, and {{has the advantage of}} using the same units in the numerator and denominator (in this case kWh). Over the entire heating season, the COP can average in the range of 2 – 3 or more [17, 33, 37]. Performance can be adversely affected by many factors. When temperatures are high, single speed heat pumps must cycle on and off to deliver only the heating required by the home. Cycling can reduce performance, but is mitigated by new variable speed heat pump technology that allows the heat pump to match output to indoor needs. As temperatures fall, it becomes more difficult to draw heat from the outside air, and while this will reduce the need to cycle on and off, it increases the risk of frost, ice and snow building up on the <b>outdoor</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> To combat this inevitability, defrost cycles are periodically activated by reversing the refrigerant flow and dumping heat outside to melt any ice or snow that has built up [30]. As temperatures fall further, the heat pump will struggle to provide adequate heating and require backup heating from a conventional heating system. In Ontario, even modern variable speed heat pumps {{may not be able to}} provide for all of a home’s heating needs throughout the heating season. Despite all of these problems, modern heat pumps can operate at very low outdoor temperatures and many can maintain their full heating capacities at temperatures of - 15 ^∘C [19, 30, 37]. Because the COP varies over both the range of operating temperatures and amongst different models of heat pumps, an aggregated estimate of performance is necessary to predict energy requirements over the geographic and temporal ranges studied.|$|E

This research sought to determine whether staged fins on outdoor evaporators could slow the growth of frost on the fins and improve heat pump frosting/defrosting performance. The staging method involved having larger fin spacing, or a smaller fin density, on the front row with respect to the subsequent rows on the heat exchanger. Prior research emphasized the potential benefit of fin geometry and fin spacing on the overall heat transfer of the <b>outdoor</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> An experimental plan was developed to examine fin staging on the outdoor evaporator of a residential, 3 ton (10. 6 kW), air-source heat pump with a standard two-row coil design and one with a non-standard three-row coil design. For the two-row coil, in addition to the base case, there were two cases of fin staging that were examined. The three-row coil base case coil was tested against one case of fin staging. System performance was measured during steady state cooling operation at outdoor conditions of 95 ?F (35. 0 ?C) and 82 ?F (27. 8 ?C) with indoor temperature of 80 ?F (26. 7 ?C) dry-bulb and 67 ?F (19. 4 ?C) wet-bulb. Steady state heating performance was measured at 47 ?F (8. 3 ?C) dry-bulb and 43 ?F (6. 1 ?C) wet-bulb outdoor temperatures with an indoor dry-bulb temperature of 70 ?F (21. 1 ?C). Frosting/defrosting performance was then tested at the standard outdoor condition of 35 ?F (1. 7 ?C) and 82 % RH with an indoor dry-bulb of 70 ?F (21. 1 ?C) [Test 1]. Additional tests were done to examine the impact of outdoor conditions at: (Test 2) 35 ?F (1. 7 ?C) with 90 % RH, (Test 3) 35 ?F (1. 7 ?C) with 95 % RH, and (Test 4) 28 ?F (- 2. 2 ?C) with 90 % RH. For the two-row heat exchangers, three airflow rates were examined: 2800 cfm (79. 3 m?/min), 2100 cfm (59. 5 m?/min), and 1400 cfm (39. 6 m?/min). For the three-row heat exchangers, two airflow rates were examined: 2800 cfm (79. 3 m?/min) and 2250 cfm (63. 7 m?/min). A detailed comparison of the physical processes that occurred during the frosting/defrosting cycles for the stated heat pumps is provided...|$|E
