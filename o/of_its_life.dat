5|$|Females become {{sexually mature}} {{at the age}} of six to seven years, while males become sexually mature at about 10 years old. The {{gestation}} period is around 15–16 months. The calf, which typically weighs , is weaned after about 15 months and stays with its mother for the first two to three years <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>life.</b> In the wild, the birth interval for this species is estimated to be four to five years; its natural offspring-rearing behavior is unstudied.|$|E
5|$|For {{at least}} a portion <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>life,</b> a star shines due to {{thermonuclear}} fusion of hydrogen into helium in its core, releasing energy that traverses the star's interior and then radiates into outer space. Almost all naturally occurring elements heavier than helium are created by stellar nucleosynthesis during the star's lifetime, and for some stars by supernova nucleosynthesis when it explodes. Near the end <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>life,</b> a star can also contain degenerate matter. Astronomers can determine the mass, age, metallicity (chemical composition), and many other properties of a star by observing its motion through space, its luminosity, and spectrum respectively. The total mass of a star is the main factor that determines its evolution and eventual fate. Other characteristics of a star, including diameter and temperature, change over its life, while the star's environment affects its rotation and movement. A plot of the temperature of many stars against their luminosities produces a plot known as a Hertzsprung–Russell diagram (H–R diagram). Plotting a particular star on that diagram allows the age and evolutionary state of that star to be determined.|$|E
5|$|Physeterids and Kogiids {{consist of}} sperm whales. Sperm whales consist {{the largest and}} {{smallest}} odontocetes, and spend {{a large portion of}} their life hunting squid. P. macrocephalus spends most <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>life</b> in search of squid in the depths; these animals do not require any degree of light at all, in fact, blind sperm whales have been caught in perfect health. The behaviour of Kogiids remains largely unknown, but, due to their small lungs, they are thought to hunt in the photic zone.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Debby was {{the fifth}} {{tropical}} storm of the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season. Debby formed just {{off the coast of}} Africa on August 21 from a tropical wave. After passing near the Cape Verde islands, Debby moved generally northwestward for much <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>life,</b> reaching a peak intensity of 50mph (85km/h). Strong wind shear weakened the storm, and Debby dissipated on August 27 over the northern Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Around 5.4billion {{years from}} now, {{the core of}} the Sun will become hot enough to trigger {{hydrogen}} fusion in its surrounding shell. This will cause the outer layers of the star to expand greatly, and the star will enter a phase <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>life</b> in which it is called a red giant. Within 7.5billion years, the Sun will have expanded to a radius of 1.2AU—256 times its current size. At the tip of the red giant branch, {{as a result of the}} vastly increased surface area, the Sun's surface will be much cooler (about 2600K) than now and its luminosity much higher—up to 2,700current solar luminosities. For part of its red giant life, the Sun will have a strong stellar wind that will carry away around 33% of its mass. During these times, it is possible that Saturn's moon Titan could achieve surface temperatures necessary to support life.|$|E

5|$|Catering for {{visitors}} at Belle Vue {{was on an}} industrial scale, ranging from the late 19th century hot water rooms, which accommodated up to 3,000 diners each, providing crockery and hot water for those who brought their own picnics, to more upmarket themed restaurants.

Although he made some improvements to the zoo, Forte's interests lay in developing the gardens' dining and exhibition facilities. The Kings Hall was then the largest exhibition space outside London, but competition from the G-Mex exhibition and conference centre in central Manchester led directly to its closure in 1987.|$|E
5|$|During the day, {{the solitary}} tasselled {{wobbegong}} can generally be found lying inside caves or under ledges with its tail curled. Individual sharks tend to remain within a local area and have favored resting spots. While resting, it opportunistically ambushes nearby fishes and invertebrates, and also lures in prey by waving its tail {{to mimic the}} appearance of a small fish. At night, it emerges and actively forages for food. This species is aplacental viviparous, though little is known <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>life</b> history. The tasselled wobbegong has been reported to bite and kill humans unprovoked; attacks may result from people accidentally disturbing the shark or being misperceived as prey. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Near Threatened, as outside of Australia it is threatened by fisheries and habitat degradation.|$|E

5|$|Fungi have a {{worldwide}} distribution, and grow {{in a wide}} range of habitats, including extreme environments such as deserts or areas with high salt concentrations or ionizing radiation, as well as in deep sea sediments. Some can survive the intense UV and cosmic radiation encountered during space travel. Most grow in terrestrial environments, though several species live partly or solely in aquatic habitats, such as the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, a parasite that has been responsible for {{a worldwide}} decline in amphibian populations. This organism spends part <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>life</b> cycle as a motile zoospore, enabling it to propel itself through water and enter its amphibian host. Other examples of aquatic fungi include those living in hydrothermal areas of the ocean.|$|E
5|$|Given {{that the}} Parliament does not form the {{government}} in the traditional sense of a Parliamentary system, its politics have developed along more consensual lines rather than majority rule of competing parties and coalitions. Indeed, for much <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>life</b> it has been dominated by a grand coalition of the European People's Party and the Party of European Socialists. The two major parties tend to co-operate to find a compromise between their two groups leading to proposals endorsed by huge majorities. However, this does not always produce agreement, and each may instead try to build other alliances, the EPP normally with other centre-right or right wing Groups and the PES with centre-left or left wing Groups. Sometimes, the Liberal Group is then in the pivotal position. There are also occasions where very sharp party political divisions have emerged, for example over the resignation of the Santer Commission.|$|E
