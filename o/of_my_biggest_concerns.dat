500|$|Following the Finnish {{school shootings}} of 2007 and 2008, media reports again {{attempted}} {{to draw a}} connection between the shooters and KMFDM, and noted that both listed the band among their favorites. In an interview with Norwegian broadcaster NRK shortly after the 2008 incident, Konietzko responded to these claims by saying the recent shootings were a by-product of the copycat mentality and the Finnish shooters' desire to emulate the lifestyles and actions of the Columbine shooters. [...] "One <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>concerns</b> immediately following this incident [...] was that there would be copycats repeating such things in the future, as there often are when people commit heinous crimes and acts of violence. I was, unfortunately, right." ...|$|E
5000|$|Turner Industries is {{a privately}} owned {{industrial}} plant with facilities in several {{cities and states}} including Paris, Texas. In February 2009, Concerned Citizens for Racial Equality received complaints and photos regarding a noose, racist graffiti, Confederate flags, and salary and advancement discrimination against black workers in the Turner Industries Paris plant. Activism led to a federal investigation by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The findings led to a federal lawsuit which was settled out of court, as well as changes in Turner Industries employment practices. Cherry stated, [...] "One <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>concerns</b> regarding the racist graffiti, noose, and other things found at the plant is the mentality of those who put it there. Those same people serve on juries, and some go on to have supervisory positions or other positions of authority." [...] The Turner Industries investigation {{was one of the}} largest civil rights investigations ever undertaken in the State of Texas.|$|E

In one instance, someone wanted me to take a player on a higher salary than we would normally pay, so he offered me a certain amount of cash as a gift to get me to do it. I said no and it didn't take any time whatsoever to reach that decision. Since 1999 when I became chairman here, my managers have been offered bungs. We've missed out on a lot of footballers because of it and that is one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>concerns.</b> It is very disturbing and in the Premiership where there are huge, huge deals taking place, it is a major problem." [...] The Football Association asked Oyston, and others who made similar claims, to name the agents concerned, saying that they had a duty to provide evidence.|$|E
