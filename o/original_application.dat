25|$|An application, {{signed by}} H. P. Davis, was {{submitted}} to the Eighth District Radio Inspector, S. W.

Neither KDKA's <b>original</b> <b>application,</b> nor the resulting license, mentioned broadcasting, only that the station was to be used for radiotelegraphic communication with stations located at the Westinghouse facilities in Cleveland, Newark and Springfield, plus station WCG in Brooklyn, New York, which was operated by the recently acquired International Radio Telegraph.|$|E
25|$|Southern's {{failure was}} met with anger and disbelief by its board of directors. Although the IBA gave its {{standard}} reason for these decisions, that the competitor offered a better mix of programmes and greater investment, it was believed the station's non-local ownership may have swayed the balance against it. Another factor {{may have been the}} company's very conservative (and possibly dull) nature and that, with a new decade just dawned, the south of England would be a radically different area; it was felt that Southern Television's application was, understandably, more of the same tried and tested formula, which in time would not have reflected the possibilities for the area. Yet another possible factor was the incumbent's complacency: its <b>original</b> <b>application</b> was a mere 16-pages long. Tactfully the IBA invited Southern Television to re-submit, this time asking the company to go into more depth with its plans.|$|E
25|$|The {{wording of}} the writ of habeas corpus implies that the {{prisoner}} is brought to the court for {{the legality of the}} imprisonment to be examined. However, rather than issuing the writ immediately and waiting for the return of the writ by the custodian, modern practice in England is for the <b>original</b> <b>application</b> to be followed by a hearing with both parties present to decide the legality of the detention, without any writ being issued. If the detention is held to be unlawful, the prisoner can usually then be released or bailed by order of the court without having to be produced before it. It is also possible for individuals held by the state to petition for judicial review, and individuals held by non-state entities to apply for an injunction. With the development of modern public law, applications for habeas corpus have been to some extent discouraged, in favour of applications for judicial review.|$|E

25|$|In 1931, David Sarnoff of RCA {{offered to}} buy Farnsworth's patents for US$100,000, with the {{stipulation}} that he become an employee of RCA, but Farnsworth refused. In June of that year, Farnsworth joined the Philco company and moved to Philadelphia {{along with his wife}} and two children. RCA would later file an interference suit against Farnsworth, claiming Zworykin's 1923 patent had priority over Farnsworth's design, despite the fact it could present no evidence that Zworykin had actually produced a functioning transmitter tube before 1931. Farnsworth had lost two interference claims to Zworykin in 1928, but this time he prevailed and the U.S. Patent Office rendered a decision in 1934 awarding priority of the invention of the image dissector to Farnsworth. RCA lost a subsequent appeal, but litigation over a variety of issues continued for several years with Sarnoff finally agreeing to pay Farnsworth royalties. Zworykin received a patent in 1928 for a color transmission version of his 1923 patent application; he also divided his <b>original</b> <b>application</b> in 1931, receiving a patent in 1935, while a second one was eventually issued in 1938 by the Court of Appeals on a non-Farnsworth-related interference case, and over the objection of the Patent Office.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Vladimir Zworykin {{was also}} experimenting with the {{cathode ray tube}} to create and show images. While working for Westinghouse Electric in 1923, he began to develop an {{electronic}} camera tube. But in a 1925 demonstration, the image was dim, had low contrast and poor definition, and was stationary. Zworykin's imaging tube never got beyond the laboratory stage. But RCA, which acquired the Westinghouse patent, asserted that the patent for Farnsworth's 1927 image dissector was written so broadly that it would exclude any other electronic imaging device. Thus RCA, {{on the basis of}} Zworykin's 1923 patent application, filed a patent interference suit against Farnsworth. The U.S. Patent Office examiner disagreed in a 1935 decision, finding priority of invention for Farnsworth against Zworykin. Farnsworth claimed that Zworykin's 1923 system would be unable to produce an electrical image of the type to challenge his patent. Zworykin received a patent in 1928 for a color transmission version of his 1923 patent application, he also divided his <b>original</b> <b>application</b> in 1931. Zworykin was unable or unwilling to introduce evidence of a working model of his tube that was based on his 1923 patent application. In September 1939, after losing an appeal in the courts and determined to go forward with the commercial manufacturing of television equipment, RCA agreed to pay Farnsworth US$1 million over a ten-year period, in addition to license payments, to use Farnsworth's patents.|$|E
40|$|Performance {{simulation}} tools must be validated {{during the}} design process as functional models and early hardware are developed, so that designers {{can be sure of}} the performance of their designs as they implement changes. The current state-ofthe-art is to use simple hand-coded bandwidth and latency testcases to assess early performance and to calibrate performance models. Applications and benchmark suites such as SPEC CPU are difficult to set up or take too long to execute on functional models. Short trace snippets from applications can be executed on performance and functional simulators, but not without difficulty on hardware, and {{there is no guarantee that}} hand-coded tests and short snippets cover the performance of the <b>original</b> <b>applications.</b> We present a new automatic testcase synthesis methodology to address these concerns. By basing testcase synthesis on the workload characteristics of an application, we create source code that largely represents the performance of the application, but which executes in a fraction of the runtime. We synthesize representative versions of the SPEC 2000 benchmarks, compile and execute them, and obtain an average IPC within 2. 4 % of the average IPC of the original benchmarks with similar average workload characteristics. In addition, the changes in IPC due to design changes are found to be proportional to the changes in IPC for the <b>original</b> <b>applications.</b> The synthetic testcases execute more than three orders of magnitude faster than the <b>original</b> <b>applications,</b> typically in less than 300 K instructions, making performance model validation feasible...|$|R

500|$|Song of Innocence {{was one of}} many concept albums {{recorded}} as rock music was developing in various directions during the late 1960s, following {{in the wake of the}} Beatles' 1967 album Sgt.

According to music journalist Zaid Mudhaffer, the term [...] "jazz fusion" [...] was coined in a review of the record when it was released. Axelrod followed the album up in 1969 with the similarly Blake-inspired Songs of Experience, which adapted Gunther Schuller's third stream concept to baroque orchestrations and rock, pop, and R rhythms and melodies. Both albums established Axelrod as an unpredictable, challenging conceptual artist. His instrumental interpretations of Blake were the first in jazz, followed in 1971 by Rafał Augustyn's Niewinność and Adrian Mitchell's musical Tyger: A Celebration of William Blake with composer Mike Westbrook; Westbrook later composed more Blake-inspired works, including The Westbrook Blake: [...] "Bright as Fire" [...] (1980).|$|E
