5|$|Although Brumund's {{publication}} included {{drawings of}} Borobudur, the Batavia Society still {{felt that it}} was incomplete. In April 1873, van Kinsbergen set off to the monument. Cleaning, digging and other technical difficulties delayed his start in taking pictures until August that year. The wet monsoon season further hampered his work, resulting in a series of only 43 photographs taken between August to December. The Society was disappointed with the number <b>of</b> <b>photographs,</b> although satisfied with the printing and artistic quality.|$|E

40|$|Twenty-four {{patients}} with connective tissue diseases and 5 control subjects were studied by “wide-field” photography.

Six <b>of</b> 8 <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> 5 {{patients with}} systemic lupus erythematosus were correctly identified, as were 7 <b>of</b> 7 <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> 5 control subjects.

5|$|Forward Intelligence Teams (FITs) are two or {{more police}} {{officers}} who are deployed by UK police forces to gather intelligence {{on the ground and}} in some circumstances, to disrupt activists and deter anti-social behaviour. They use cameras, camcorders and audio recorders to conduct overt surveillance of the public. An unsuccessful legal challenge has been made against their use of overt surveillance, but in 2009 the Court of Appeal ruled that they must justify retention <b>of</b> <b>photographs</b> on a case-by-case basis.

Attempts by Japanese air units and anti-aircraft gun batteries to destroy the F-13 failed, as the available fighter aircraft and guns could not reach the high altitude it operated at.|$|E
