40|$|This article {{provides}} a {{critical analysis of}} research in accounting <b>of</b> <b>fixed</b> assets; the basic issues <b>of</b> <b>fixed</b> assets accounting {{that have been developed}} by the Ukrainian scientists during 1999 - 2016 have been determined. It is established that the problems of non-current assets taxation and their classification are the most noteworthy. In the dissertations the issues <b>of</b> <b>fixed</b> assets classification are of exclusively particular branch nature, so its improvement is important. The purpose of the article is developing science-based classification <b>of</b> <b>fixed</b> assets for accounting purposes since their composition is quite diverse. The classification <b>of</b> <b>fixed</b> assets for accounting purposes have been summarized and developed in Figure 1 according to the results of the research. The accomplished analysis of existing approaches to classification <b>of</b> <b>fixed</b> assets has made it possible to specify its basic types and justify the classification criteria <b>of</b> <b>fixed</b> assets for the main objects <b>of</b> <b>fixed</b> assets.

40|$|The Bachelor thesis "The Analysis <b>of</b> <b>Fixed</b> Assets" {{focuses on}} the {{problems}} <b>of</b> <b>fixed</b> assets {{within the scope of}} the Czech legal enactments.

KÁMEN Zbraslav, spol. s r. o., a stone mining and concrete production company, was chosen for this purpose. The legal enactmets, the company itself, its general characteristics and classification <b>of</b> <b>fixed</b> assets are introduced {{at the beginning of the}} work. Additionally the thesis describes all activities that the company has to solve in connection with its fixed assets. It includes the acquisition, financing and evaluation of long term property, furthermore the ranging of individual kinds <b>of</b> <b>fixed</b> assets into the company's business property, fixed register assets connected with the problematic software, bookeeping, depreciation of property and finally the possible ways <b>of</b> liquidation <b>of</b> <b>fixed</b> assets...|$|R

5|$|The Haunting was {{released}} on 18 September 1963. Audiences were frightened by it. Film critic Dora Jane Hamblin related how four of her female friends, expecting a ho-hum film, took out make-up during the film's first few minutes with the intention <b>of</b> <b>fixing</b> their faces. The film proved so frightening, she said, that the women were jumping out of their seats and losing their items. In Houston, Texas, a local cinema promoted the film as so chilling that it held a contest to see which of four patrons could sit {{all the way through}} a midnight screening; the prize was $100. Despite these stunts, The Haunting was only an average success at the box office.|$|E
5|$|The Prince of Lobkowitz, who in 1854 {{became the}} head of Mezőhegyes, {{stressed}} the importance <b>of</b> <b>fixing</b> the type– that is, making {{the characteristics of a}} breed of animal genetically homogenous– of the horses. This goal was achieved by linebreeding, though the one season that Nonius Senior served his own daughters was notably unsuccessful: of the 33 foals, 11 died while only 2 were broodmare-quality and 1 was stallion-quality. However, with more experimentation, the Nonius breed emerged as a uniformly heavy but elegant military driving and carting horse. In 1865, Arabian and Thoroughbred stallions were bred to Nonius Senior's female descendants in the hopes of correcting a lack of balance and elegance among the Nonius horses. Nonius Senior stood at stud for 22 years. By the end of his breeding life, he had served mares of Arabian, Lipizzan, Thoroughbred, Spanish and Norman blood. Fifteen of Nonius's sons in turn stood at stud, and 122 of his daughters were used as broodmares.|$|E
40|$|The present {{situation}} in the GDR in the field <b>of</b> withdrawal <b>of</b> <b>fixed</b> assets from exploitation is characterized with a small degrее of withdrawal of capital goods and considerable break-up of such operations into numerous small-range operations.

In order to meet the requirements imposed by comprehensive planning of the reproduction process it should be accepted that the basis of making decisions concerning withdrawal <b>of</b> <b>fixed</b> assets should be provided not by standardized life span <b>of</b> <b>fixed</b> assets and amortization periods based on it, but conclusions concerning utility value <b>of</b> <b>fixed</b> assets.

At that time, Mieszko was in the process <b>of</b> <b>fixing</b> an uneasy relationship with the Bohemian state of Boleslaus I. The difficulties were caused mainly by Czech cooperation with the Veleti. Already in 964, the two parties arrived at an agreement on that and other issues. In 965, Mieszko married Boleslaus' daughter Doubravka. Mieszko's chosen Christian princess, a woman possibly in her twenties, was a devout Christian and Mieszko's own conversion had {{to be a part of}} the deal. This act in fact followed in 966 and initiated the Christianization of Greater Poland, a region that up to that point had not been exposed to Christian influence, unlike Lesser Poland and Silesia. In 968, an independent missionary bishopric, reporting directly to the pope, was established, with Jordan installed as the first bishop.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after Canadian Confederation in 1867, {{the need}} for {{distinctive}} Canadian flags emerged. The first Canadian flag was that then used as {{the flag of the}} Governor General of Canada, a Union Flag with a shield in the centre bearing the quartered arms of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick surrounded by a wreath of maple leaves. In 1870 the Red Ensign, with the addition of the Canadian composite shield in the fly, began to be used unofficially on land and sea and was known as the Canadian Red Ensign. As new provinces joined the Confederation, their arms were added to the shield. In 1892, the British admiralty approved the use of the Red Ensign for Canadian use at sea. The composite shield was replaced with the coat of arms of Canada upon its grant in 1921 and, in 1924, an Order in Council approved its use for Canadian government buildings abroad. In 1925, Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King established a committee to design a flag to be used at home, but it was dissolved before the final report could be delivered. Despite the failure of the committee to solve the issue, public sentiment in the 1920s was in favour <b>of</b> <b>fixing</b> the flag problem for Canada. New designs were proposed in 1927, 1931, and 1939.|$|E

Multivariate analysis confirmed that a greater risk <b>of</b> accumulation <b>of</b> <b>fixed</b> disability was conferred by a higher Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score starting IFN beta (P = 0. 02), and by failure of IFN beta to completely suppress relapses (P = 0. 004). In conclusion, IFN beta therapy reduced the accumulation <b>of</b> <b>fixed</b> disability in a cohort of RRMS patients, followed for a median of five years.

5|$|The {{substance}} Rhoca-Gil {{was used}} to fix the leakages, but the substance failed to work properly. Not only did it fail to polymerize and stop the leaks, it also contaminated the surroundings with acrylamide. The entire process <b>of</b> <b>fixing</b> the leak and cleaning up the toxicity delayed {{the process of building}} the tunnel by one year; and it was first opened on 22 August 1999. Further complications arose due to conflicts between NSB Gardermobanen and the construction company. Retrospective surveys showed a lack of control and reporting procedures during incidents that should have been addressed in 1995, and were never taken seriously. About sixty houses received damage due to the construction of the tunnel. An evaluation performed by the Ministry of Transport and Communications showed that NOK500 million was used on fixing the leaks; however, the report claimed this was, to a large extent, a waste of money due to inefficient engineering procedures. The same report criticized the planning and organization of the entire construction of the railway.|$|E
