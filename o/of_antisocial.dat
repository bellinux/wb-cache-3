5|$|In a 1989 {{review of}} the {{research}} on juvenile delinquency and violence, Lisabeth DiLalla and Gottesman found delinquency could be transitory or continuous, and genes contributed more to the continuous type. In 1991 the same authors published a critique of the then-prevalent idea <b>of</b> <b>antisocial</b> behavior being transmitted through generations by child abuse alone in antisocial families. They stated that a review by Cathy Spatz Widom and the studies she cited had missed an element: children maltreated in families might have been targets because their genes might have influenced them into committing antisocial acts and attracting such treatment from parents.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} DSM-IV Conduct disorder (CD) symptom {{criteria in}} a community sample of adolescent males and females to evaluate {{the extent to which}} DSM-IV criteria characterize the range of severity <b>of</b> adolescent <b>antisocial</b> behavior within and across sex. Method—Interviews were conducted with 3208 adolescents between the ages of 11 – 18 years using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC). Item Response Theory (IRT) analyses were performed to obtain severity and discrimination parameters for each of the lifetime DSM-IV CD symptom criteria. Additionally, IRT-based Differential Item Functioning (DIF) analyses were conducted to examine {{the extent to which the}} symptom criteria function similarly across sex. Results—The DSM-IV CD symptom criteria are useful and meaningful indicators <b>of</b> severe adolescent <b>antisocial</b> behavior. A single item (“Stealing without Confrontation) was a poor indicator <b>of</b> severe <b>antisocial</b> behavior. The CD symptom criteria function very similarly across sex; however, three items had significantly different severity parameters. Conclusions—The DSM-IV CD criteria are informative as categorical and continuous measures <b>of</b> severe adolescent <b>antisocial</b> behavior; however, some CD criteria display sex-bias...|$|R

Cleckley, an American psychiatrist, {{influenced}} the initial diagnostic criteria for antisocial personality reaction/disturbance in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), as did American psychologist George E.

The DSM and International Classification of Diseases (ICD) subsequently introduced the diagnoses <b>of</b> <b>antisocial</b> personality disorder (ASPD) and dissocial personality disorder respectively, stating that these diagnoses have {{been referred to}} (or include what is referred to) as psychopathy or sociopathy. The creation of ASPD and DPD was driven {{by the fact that}} many of the classic traits of psychopathy were impossible to measure objectively. Canadian psychologist Robert D. Hare later repopularized the construct of psychopathy in criminology with his Psychopathy Checklist.|$|E
25|$|Some {{research}} even {{suggests that}} increases in immigration may partly explain {{the reduction in}} the U.S. crime rate. A 2005 study showed that immigration to large U.S. metropolitan areas does not increase, and in some cases decreases, crime rates there. A 2009 study found that recent immigration was not associated with homicide in Austin, Texas. The low crime rates of immigrants to the United States despite having lower levels of education, lower levels of income and residing in urban areas (factors that should lead to higher crime rates) may be due to lower rates <b>of</b> <b>antisocial</b> behavior among immigrants. A 2015 study found that Mexican immigration to the United States was associated with an increase in aggravated assaults and a decrease in property crimes. A 2016 study finds no link between immigrant populations and violent crime, although there is a small but significant association between undocumented immigrants and drug-related crime.|$|E

2500|$|Conduct {{disorder}} is diagnosed {{based on a}} prolonged pattern <b>of</b> <b>antisocial</b> behavior in childhood and/or adolescence, and {{may be seen as}} a precursor to ASPD. Some researchers have speculated that there are two subtypes of conduct disorder which mark dual developmental pathways to adult psychopathy. The DSM allows differentiating between childhood onset before age 10 and adolescent onset at age 10 and later. Childhood onset is argued to be more due to a personality disorder caused by neurological deficits interacting with an adverse environment. For many, but not all, childhood onset is associated with what is in Terrie Moffitt's developmental theory of crime referred to as [...] "life-course- persistent" [...] antisocial behavior as well as poorer health and economic status. Adolescent onset is argued to more typically be associated with short-term antisocial behavior.|$|E

Differences in ERP component P 400 over posterior temporal areas were found during 6 -month-olds' observation of helping and hindering agents (Experiment 1), but not during observation of identically moving agents that did not help or hinder (Experiment 2). The results demonstrate that the P 400 component indexes activation of infants' memories of previously perceived interactions between social agents.

2500|$|Research {{indicates}} that the more corporal punishment children receive, {{the more likely they}} are as adults to act violently towards family members, including intimate partners. Children who are spanked more as children are more likely as adults to approve of hitting a partner, and also experience more marital conflict and feelings of anger in general. A number of studies have found physical punishment to be associated with [...] "higher levels of aggression against parents, siblings, peers and spouses", even when controlling for other factors. While these associations do not prove causation, a number of longitudinal studies suggest that the experience of physical punishment has a direct causal effect on later aggressive behaviors. According to research, corporal punishment of children predicts weaker internalisation of values such as empathy, altruism, and resistance to temptation. According to researcher Joan Durrant at the University of Manitoba, it should therefore not be surprising that corporal punishment [...] "consistently predicts increased levels <b>of</b> <b>antisocial</b> behavior [...] as well as dating violence".|$|E
2500|$|Gaining an Experimental Arts Grant {{from the}} {{publicly}} funded Yorkshire Arts Association, COUM {{described themselves as}} performance artists, being inspired by the Dadaists and emphasising the amateur quality of their work. They entered the National Rock/Folk Contest at Hull's New Grange Club with a set titled This Machine Kills Music, and organised events for Hull City Council's celebrations to mark the UK's entry into the European Economic Community in 1973. P-Orridge had also worked on solo projects, generating controversy in the local press over a conceptual artwork the artist entered at a local exhibition. Taking an increasing interest in infantilism, P-Orridge founded the fictitious L'ecole de l'art infantile and co-organised the [...] "Baby's Coumpetition" [...] at Oxford University's 1973 May Festival, also producing material as the fictitious Ministry <b>of</b> <b>Antisocial</b> Insecurity, a parody of the Ministry of Social Security. Meanwhile, P-Orridge created the character of Alien Brain, and in July 1972 performed the World Premiere of The Alien Brain at Hull Arts Centre. COUM also began publishing books; in 1972, they brought out {{the first volume of}} The Million and One Names of COUM, part of a proposed project to release 1001 slogans (such as [...] "A thousand and one ways to COUM" [...] and [...] "COUM are Fab and Kinky"), while in 1973 P-Orridge published Copyright Breeches, which explored an ongoing personal fascination with the copyright symbol and its implications for art and society.|$|E

40|$|The present {{research}} {{is the first of}} its kind in Australia to simultaneously examine individual, family and neighbourhood predictors <b>of</b> adolescent <b>antisocial</b> behaviour. The study draws on two key data sources- Australian Bureau of Statistics census data and the Mater University Study of Pregnancy (MUSP). The MUSP is a prospective longitudinal study of mothers and their children in Brisbane, Australia; the current project draws on data from birth through to adolescence (age 14 years). The study found that less than one percent <b>of</b> variation in <b>antisocial</b> behaviour was attributable to the statistical local area (SLA). Subsequent models of both SLA-level variables (neighbourhood disadvantage, immigration concentration and residential mobility) and individual and familial variables, showed that the strongest predictors <b>of</b> adolescent <b>antisocial</b> behaviour are those which measure disruptions in parenting processes, poor school performance and early childhood aggression. The findings suggest that programs that aim to enhance parenting practices, including improving communication, supervision and monitoring of children, are important in reducing adolescent antisocial behaviour.

40|$|Introduction Aggressive antisocial {{behavior}} {{is a major}} challenge to society, and studies on the determinants of its persistence {{are essential to the}} development of strategies to prevent violence. Aims & Methods The overall aim of the thesis was to establish covariates <b>of</b> persistent aggressive <b>antisocial</b> behavior in a population-based cohort and in clinically evaluated, prospectively followed, offender groups. Specific aims were: (1) to quantify the persistence <b>of</b> aggressive <b>antisocial</b> behavior, (2) to identify risk factors for such persistence, (3) to describe the distribution of psychopathic traits (according to the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised; PCL-R) in relation to clinical factors, and (4) to determine thinking styles related to aggressive {{antisocial behavior}}. Results One percent of the Swedish general population was responsible for 63 % of all violent crimes between 1973 and 2004. Risk factors for persistence <b>of</b> aggressive <b>antisocial</b> behavior included its early onset, conduct disorder, antisocial personality disorder, and substance-related disorders. In the PCL-R, the Antisocial facet outperformed all other facets and the total score as a predictor of persistence. The Interpersonal facet showed unique clinical attributes. A distorted thinking style characterized by antisocial features was related to aggressive antisocial behavior. Conclusions Aggressive antisocial behaviors and clinical factors including externalizing mental health problems aggregate within individuals. The best predictor <b>of</b> future aggressive <b>antisocial</b> behavior is a history of similar behaviors, especially with an early onset. Scientific and clinical efforts aimed to prevent violence have therefore to focus both on early-onset and persistent aggressive antisocial behavior, and their associated clinical and cognitive characteristics...|$|R
