5|$|Failing to {{find another}} job at a news agency, he met {{producer}} Allan Burns at a party. Burns got him a job <b>on</b> <b>My</b> <b>Mother</b> the Car where he was hired to rewrite a script after pitching some story ideas. Brooks {{then went on to}} write episodes of That Girl, The Andy Griffith Show and My Three Sons before Sheldon Leonard hired him as a story editor on My Friend Tony. In 1969 he created for ABC the series Room 222, which lasted until 1974. Room 222 was the second series in American history to feature a black lead character, in this case high school teacher Pete Dixon played by Lloyd Haynes. The network felt the show was sensitive and so attempted to change the pilot story so that Dixon helped a white student rather than a black one, but Brooks prevented it. On the show Brooks worked with Gene Reynolds who taught him the importance of extensive and diligent research, which he conducted at Los Angeles High School for Room 222, and he used the technique on his subsequent works. Brooks left Room 222 as head writer after one year to work on other pilots and brought Burns in to produce the show.|$|E
25|$|While {{continuing}} his writing and consulting on foreign affairs, Masuzoe relocated from Tokyo to Kitakyushu in the 1990s {{to take care}} of his aging mother, who began to show signs of deteriorating mental health. In 1998, he published a book entitled When I Put a Diaper <b>on</b> <b>My</b> <b>Mother,</b> which details his experience caring for his mother and the obstacles imposed by the Japanese welfare system. The book sold 100,000 copies, more than any of his previous political works, and propelled Masuzoe into the national spotlight as an authority on the aging society in Japan.|$|E
500|$|Jolie was {{involved}} in a well-publicized Hollywood scandal when she was accused of having caused the 2005 divorce of actors Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. She {{had fallen in love with}} Pitt during filming of Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), but dismissed allegations of an affair, saying, [...] "To be intimate with a married man, when my own father cheated <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> is not something I could forgive. I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that. I wouldn't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife." [...] Jolie and Pitt did not publicly comment on the nature of their relationship until January 2006, when she confirmed that she was pregnant with his child.|$|E

They said it would be like taking coals to Newcastle, helping a boy born on a Wednesday; and my uncle, when he died, left every penny of his money to my brother Sam, as a slight compensation to him for having been born on a Friday. All I ever got was advice upon the duties and responsibilities of wealth, when it arrived, and entreaties that I would not neglect those with claims upon me when I came to be a rich man." ...|$|E

But, as I said before, I think <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> and am convinced as much as of the existence of my own soul, that no touch of shame could arise from aught in which she was implicated. Meantime, I am wealthy, and I am alone, and why does my friend scruple to share my wealth? ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'You {{ask what}} is the matter with it,' my sister replied; 'there is not [...] enough on it for us to eat, and what there is is cabbage and carrots, [...] which we detest.' Her first answer had already angered my father, but [...] now he gave vent to his fury. But instead of {{punishing}} my sister he [...] poured it all <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> my brother, and myself. To begin with he [...] threw his plate at my brother's head, {{who would have been}} struck had [...] he not got out of the way; a second one he threw at me, which I also [...] happily escaped; then torrents of abuse followed these first signs of [...] hostility. He reproached the Queen with having brought up her [...] children so badly. 'You will curse your mother,' he said to my [...] brother, 'for having made you such a good-for-nothing creature.' [...] As my brother and I passed near him to leave the room, he hit out at [...] us with his crutch. Happily we escaped the blow; for it would [...] certainly have struck us down, and we at last escaped without harm.|$|E
60|$|Solivet had hinted as much, and the {{protection}} of my child was a powerful engine; but--shall I confess it?--it galled and chafed me terribly to feel myself taken once more into leading-strings. I, who had for three years governed my house as a happy honoured wife, and for three more had been a chatelaine, complimented by the old uncle, and after his death, the sole ruler of my son's domain; I was not at all inclined to return into tutelage, and I could not look <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> after these six years, as quite the same conclusive authority as I thought her when I left her. The spirit of self-assertion and self-justification was strong within me, and though I hope I did not reply with ingratitude or disrespect, I would make no absolute promise till I had heard what my brother Walwyn said of my position in its secular aspect, and the Abbe Bonchamps in its religious point of view. So I bade my mother good-night, and went to see how Cecile fared in her new quarters, which, to her grief, were in a wing separated from mine by a long corridor.|$|E
6000|$|Infinitely queer and quaint, almost incongruously droll, {{the sense}} somehow begotten in ourselves, as very young persons, {{of our being}} {{surrounded}} by a slightly remote, yet dimly rich, outer and quite kindred circle of the tipsy. I remember how, once, as a very small boy, after meeting in the hall a most amiable and irreproachable gentleman, all but closely consanguineous, {{who had come to}} call <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> I anticipated his further entrance by slipping in to report to that parent that I thought he must be tipsy. And I was to recall perfectly afterwards the impression I so made on her--in which the general proposition that the gentlemen of a certain group or connection might on occasion be best described by the term I had used sought to destroy the particular presumption that our visitor wouldn't, by his ordinary measure, show himself for one of those. He didn't, to all appearance, for I was afterwards disappointed at the lapse of lurid evidence: that memory remained with me, as well as a considerable subsequent wonder at my having leaped to so baseless a view. The truth was indeed that we had too, in the most innocent way in the world, our sense of [...] "dissipation" [...] as an abounding element in family histories; a sense fed quite directly by our fondness for making our father--I can at any rate testify for the urgency of my own appeal to him--tell us stories of the world of his youth. He regaled us with no scandals, yet it somehow rarely failed to come out that each contemporary on his younger scene, each hero of each thrilling adventure, had, in spite of brilliant promise and romantic charm, ended badly, as badly as possible. This became our gaping generalisation--it gaped even under the moral that the anecdote was always, and so familiarly, humanly and vividly, designed to convey: everyone in the little old Albany of the Dutch houses and the steep streets and the recurrent family names--Townsends, Clintons, Van Rensselaers, Pruyns: I pick them up again at hazard, and all uninvidiously, out of reverberations long since still--everyone without exception had at last taken a turn as far as possible from edifying. And what they had most in common, the hovering presences, the fitful apparitions that, speaking for myself, so engaged my imagination, was just the fine old Albany drama--in the light of which a ring of mystery as to their lives (mainly carried on at the New York Hotel aforesaid) surrounded them, and their charm, inveterate, as I believed, shone out as through vaguely-apprehended storm-clouds. Their charm was in various marks of which I shall have more to say--for as I breathe all this hushed air again even the more broken things give out touching human values and faint sweet scents of character, flushes of old beauty and good-will.|$|E
60|$|I am {{the second}} {{son of an}} English gentleman of large fortune.
