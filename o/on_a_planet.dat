5|$|Science fiction films often depict humans {{successfully}} repelling alien invasions, {{but scientists}} more often take {{the view that}} an extraterrestrial civilization with sufficient power to reach the Earth {{would be able to}} destroy human civilization with minimal effort. Operations that are enormous on a human scale, such as destroying all major population centers <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>planet,</b> bombarding a planet with deadly neutron radiation, or even traveling to another planetary system in order to lay waste to it, may be important tools for a hostile and totalitarian civilization.|$|E
5|$|Space Cavern is a 1982 shooter {{video game}} for the Atari 2600 {{developed}} and released by Games by Apollo. Players control a spaceship commander who has landed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>planet</b> and must defend the ship against its hostile creatures. Games by Apollo founder Pat Roper {{was impressed by the}} game Demon Attack and tasked Apollo member Dan Oliver with making a game very similar to it. The game was later rereleased as Space Canyon.|$|E
5|$|This formula was {{powerful}} enough to stand {{as the basis for}} all subsequent descriptions of motion within the solar system until the 20th century. During that time, sophisticated methods of perturbation analysis were invented to calculate the deviations of orbits due to the influence of multiple bodies <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>planet,</b> moon, comet, or asteroid. The formalism was exact enough to allow mathematicians to predict the existence of the planet Neptune before it was observed.|$|E

25|$|Besides {{direct effect}} of {{asteroid}} impacts <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>planet's</b> surface topography, global climate and life, {{recent studies have}} shown that several consecutive impacts might have <b>an</b> effect <b>on</b> the dynamo mechanism at <b>a</b> <b>planet's</b> core responsible for maintaining the magnetic field of the planet, and might eventually shut down the planet's magnetic field.|$|R
5|$|A {{few months}} later Luis is elected Chair of the ship's ruling council, and helps bring about a {{settlement}} wherein the people on board can choose {{whether or not to}} stay on the ship, and also choose whether the ship stays in orbit around Hsin Ti Chiu. Hsing has a child by Hiroshi, but Hiroshi dies soon afterward, of heart failure. The ship's educational curriculum is revised, and all schools are required to allow teachers who are not angels to teach material relevant to living on the new planet. The new planet proves to be habitable by humans, and around a quarter of the ship's population moves to it, settling down despite the difficulty of learning to live <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>planet</b> again. The ship leaves, not intending to return.|$|E
5|$|After {{the pilot}} docks with {{a space station}} or lands <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>planet,</b> the screen and its {{interface}} change to a rendition of the area he is visiting. The player moves the pilot to different locations and interacts with certain objects, such as reading a bulletin board and talking to other characters, by clicking on their graphical representations. Freelancers economy consists of buying and selling spacecraft, their armaments and components, and commodities. Certain goods are considered contraband in some systems, {{and they have to}} be smuggled past police patrols to their buyers. Computer-controlled characters (non-player characters or NPCs) in certain locations on the planets or stations offer quests and jobs.|$|E

They finally reach the Shadow Broker's office, discovering him to be a Yahg, a little-known alien species. The Broker engages Shepard and Liara in combat, but is eventually killed. Liara now assumes the position of the Shadow Broker, and promises Shepard that she will turn the organization around. She also mentions that she will be able to provide Shepard with more information thanks to the Broker's extensive networks.|$|E

5|$|In 2029, {{aboard the}} United States Air Force space station Oberon, Leo Davidson {{works closely with}} {{primates}} who are trained for space missions. His favorite simian co-worker is a chimpanzee named Pericles. With a deadly electromagnetic storm approaching the station, a small space pod piloted by Pericles is used to probe the storm. Pericles's pod heads into the storm and disappears. Against his commanding officer's orders, Leo takes a second pod and goes in pursuit of Pericles. Entering the storm, Leo loses contact with the Oberon and crashes <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>planet</b> called Ashlar in the year 5021. He discovers {{that the world is}} ruled by humanoid apes who speak English, use domesticated horses for transportation, and treat human beings as slaves.|$|E
5|$|Planet of the Apes is a 2001 American {{science fiction}} film {{directed}} by Tim Burton and starring Mark Wahlberg, Tim Roth, Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Clarke Duncan, Paul Giamatti, and Estella Warren.

It tells the story of astronaut Leo Davidson crash-landing <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>planet</b> inhabited by intelligent apes. The apes treat humans as slaves, but {{with the help of an}} ape named Ari, Leo starts a rebellion.|$|E
5|$|The second {{version was}} a lyric video, which {{features}} Hamasaki in a recording studio. It also features candid photos of Hamasaki in Los Angeles, Japan, and doing other endeavours outside of music. The Riff Studio version features Hamasaki as her character design AyuPan and a character titled the Bloody Bunny. Both {{of them are}} in a space ship, and travel throughout different worlds and atmospheres, until landing <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>planet</b> with blue aliens. The aliens appear to be sad, whist AyuPan and the Bloody Bunny stand there. AyuPan then plays the song from her space ship, and makes the aliens feel happy; they all begin dancing to the track. It ends with the world turning pink instead of blue, and has heart shapes around it. This version premiered one week before the album's release in July 2, and was included on the DVD and Blu-Ray versions of Colours.|$|E

5|$|Wind is {{the flow}} of gases on a large scale. On {{the surface of the}} Earth, wind {{consists}} of the bulk movement of air. In outer space, solar wind is the movement of gases or charged particles from the Sun through space, while planetary wind is the outgassing of light chemical elements from a planet's atmosphere into space. Winds are commonly classified by their spatial scale, their speed, the types of forces that cause them, the regions in which they occur, and their effect. The strongest observed winds <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>planet</b> in the Solar System occur on Neptune and Saturn. Winds have various aspects, an important one being its velocity (wind speed); another the density of the gas involved; another its energy content or wind energy.|$|E
5|$|Halo 4 {{takes place}} in a futuristic science fiction setting in the year 2557, four years after the events of Halo 3. Backstory details that {{hundreds}} of thousands of years before the modern era, humans were one of several interstellar civilizations. Following a war with the parasitic Flood, the humans came into conflict with the Forerunners, a powerful race that upheld a policy of benevolent shepherding of other races known as the Mantle of Responsibility. Humanity had begun an aggressive campaign of destroying any Flood infestations <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>planet,</b> which was misinterpreted as a desire for conquest. After centuries of war the Forerunners defeated the humans, ancestors of the contemporary human race, and stripped them of their technology and empire. The Forerunners soon fought the Flood themselves; after exhausting every other strategic option available to them, the Forerunners activated weapons of mass destruction known as the Halo Array. The Array's firing killed all sentient life in the galaxy to deprive the Flood of their food. Life that the Forerunners cataloged was then reseeded throughout the galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Kor (John Colicos), a revered Klingon warrior, is in Quark's Bar {{telling stories}} of past battles {{to his friend}} Lieutenant Commander Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell). She notices Lieutenant Commander Worf (Michael Dorn) nearby and invites him to meet Kor, who greets Worf happily, saying that anyone who is so {{strongly}} disliked by the Klingon government {{is a friend of}} his. He explains to Jadzia and Worf that he is on the station as part of his plan to find the legendary Sword of Kahless. The sword is the original bat'leth, used by Kahless to defeat the tyrant Molor. Kor received a shroud from a Vulcan science team, which he believes once held the Sword. He gives it to Jadzia to test the shroud's authenticity. As he returns to his quarters, Kor is attacked by a Lethean who reads his thoughts in order to find out about the Sword and then removes his memories of the attack. Jadzia finds him the following morning, and thinks that he has passed out from too much alcohol. She has verified the authenticity of the shroud. Captain Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) lends the trio a Runabout to travel into the Gamma Quadrant to search for the sword <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>planet</b> where the Vulcan team found the shroud.|$|E

5|$|The Doctor, Ian, and Barbara {{are still}} missing the Doctor's granddaughter Susan when the TARDIS lands <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>planet</b> the Doctor {{eventually}} recognises as Dido, a world he has visited before. The trio soon encounter two survivors of a space crash, Vicki and Bennett, who are awaiting a rescue ship that is due to arrive in three days time. Vicki and Bennett live in fear of Koquillion, a bipedal inhabitant of Dido, who is stalking the area. Koquillion encounters the time travellers and attacks, pushing Barbara over a cliff and temporarily trapping Ian and the Doctor. Vicki finds Barbara injured and rescues her from Koquillion, and they share reminiscences. Vicki's father was amongst those who died when {{the survivors of the}} crash, save Bennett and Vicki, were lured to their deaths by the natives of Dido. She is evidently very lonely, having befriended an indigenous Sand Beast for company. However, when Ian and the Doctor reach the ship, tempers are fraught because Barbara mistook the Sand Beast for a threat and killed it.|$|E
5|$|The initial premise {{placed the}} story on a space station to avoid the {{ecological}} damage that the creatures would have <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>planet.</b> However, Gerrold's agent was concerned that requiring a miniature of the station to be built {{as well as the}} additional sets would cause it to be too expensive for a single episode. Because of his agent's comments, Gerrold modified the pitch to place the action on a colony planet instead. This pitch included the plot points such as the creatures getting into a poisoned grain storage, but omitted the Klingons; and Cyrano Jones was called Cyrano Smith. The five pitches were submitted by Gerrold's agent in February 1967, and received a response in June. At the time the show had already purchased too many scripts for the second season but story editor D. C. Fontana suggested that they should purchase the story and assign it to a staff writer as it was better than some of the other stories they already had.|$|E
5|$|The player's primary mode of {{transportation}} is a starship which serves as Shepard's base of operations. Aboard the ship, the player can interact with the squad members, buy new equipment, and travel to numerous planetary systems. Although the game features {{a large number of}} planets for the player to examine, only a few of them can actually be landed on and explored. Some of them can also be surveyed to search for valuable resources and quest-relevant items. Upon landing <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>planet,</b> the player can traverse on-foot or by using an all-terrain infantry fighting vehicle called the M35 Mako. Most of the game's main quests are geared toward on-foot combat, but some segments may feature combat requiring the use of the M35 Mako. In contrast, secondary quests usually require the player to explore free-roam uncharted worlds with the vehicle. Equipment items, which include armor, weapon, and ammunition upgrades, can be found around the environment or purchased from merchants in settlements.|$|E
