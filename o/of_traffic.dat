5|$|Plans for {{a second}} Narrows Bridge were mooted during the 1970s, but did not eventuate.

This quantity <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> far outstripped the expected capacity of the bridge when it opened in 1959. The solution to the traffic problem most favoured by road planners in 1998 was to widen the existing bridge by building a smaller second traffic bridge just west from it and joining their decks to form a contiguous roadway. This would increase the number <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> lanes from seven to 10. The widening was expected to cost $50 million.|$|E
