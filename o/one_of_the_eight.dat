5|$|The phylogenetic {{relationships}} of the serval {{have remained in}} dispute; in 1997, palaeontologists M.C. McKenna and S.K.

Studies in the 2000s and the 2010s show that the serval, along with the caracal and the African golden cat, forms <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eight</b> lineages of Felidae.
