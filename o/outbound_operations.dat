Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is the {{agency responsible for}} securing {{the borders of the}} United States from those people and things that would do the United States harm. The Office of Field Operations (OFO) is the office responsible for securing the Ports of Entry (POEs). CBP/OFO has dedicated personnel, technology, infrastructure and resources assigned to the inbound inspections for processing those travelers and inbound processing has been a national priority of CBP since its inception in 2003. Although CBP/OFO has the authority to conduct outbound inspections, there is little infrastructure, intelligence sharing or technology at the POEs for conducting <b>outbound</b> <b>operations.</b> Some POEs are conducting <b>outbound</b> <b>operations</b> with officers that have been taken from the inbound staffing models. However, at the time of writing this thesis, CBP does not have a national policy mandating POEs conduct <b>outbound</b> <b>operations.</b> On the Southwest Border (SWB), the Mexican Drug Trafficking Organizations (DTOs) are continuing to smuggle bulk cash and weapons into Mexico and border violence continues to increase.

40|$|AbstractBackground;Despite of the {{significant}} role of packaging within logistics and supply chain management, packaging is infrequently studied as focal point in supply chain. Most of the previous logistics research studies tend to explain the integration between packaging and logistics through logistical packaging. In very rare cases, the studies mentioned about customer value. Therefore the major disadvantage of these studies is that, they didn’t consider logistical packaging and customer value delivery as related matters. As a result customers incur significant cost in repairing damages incurred during inbound and <b>outbound</b> logistics <b>operations</b> because of poor packaging. Purpose;To explore how packaging solution manufacturers accounts for packaging requirements and delivers customer value through logistical packaging {{in order to enhance}} the efficiency in the customer’s inbound and <b>outbound</b> logistics <b>operations.</b> Method;Through a qualitative research method combined with abductive research approach, a case study at Stora Enso packaging was conducted. Logistical packaging concept and customer value equation model has been introduced in this thesis. Then, data were collected and analyzed in the context of how does Stora Enso derives packaging requirements from customers so that it deliver customer values which ultimately enhance customers’ inbound and <b>outbound</b> logistic <b>operations.</b> Conclusion;The results after the analysis showed that, the packaging solution really affects performance of different activities in a logistics chain. Moreover, it showed how Stora Enso takes into consideration logistics requirements from customers and deliver value to these customers through logistical packaging. By delivering customer values such as light, strong and durable, flexible and cost efficient, having many fields of use, and completely renewable, a Stora Enso packaging solution enhance customer’s inbound and <b>outbound</b> logistics <b>operations</b> by ensuring efficient transportation, maximum product protection, smooth handling, optimal warehouse space usage and less waste to the environment during disposal. In this way, Stora Enso delivers value to its customers by manufacturing a packaging solution that is tailored to their logistics chain requirements...|$|R

40|$|The {{competitive}} {{landscape of the}} U. S. automotive market has transformed from the traditional 2 ̆ 2 Big Three 2 ̆ 2 players to too many viable players. In 2008 - 2009, the harsh market conditions, excess production capacity, capital asset redundancies, and many inefficient strategies submerged as the roadblocks for the US automakers to stay competitive and profitable in the North American market. In this new competitive era, cross-company collaboration in product development, standardizing and communizing supply base, sharing flexible manufacturing platforms, using common inbound and out bound logistics service providers and warehousing etc. can play vital roles for the US automakers to reduce overall cost and return to profitability. Through the horizontal collaboration in the <b>outbound</b> logistics <b>operations,</b> these companies can create close-knit business partnership and act faster than the foreign rivals in delivering finished vehicles at the optimum cost. The optimization of <b>outbound</b> logistics <b>operations</b> through consolidation and collaboration among OEMs has tremendous potential {{to contribute to the}} profitability by lowering the cost of transportation, in-house inventory, transportation time, and facility costs. The collaboration in the intra- and inter-OEM <b>outbound</b> logistics <b>operations</b> is a critical area that the US automakers need to pay attention and prioritize in their cost reduction initiatives. This research presents an integrated collaboration framework for the <b>outbound</b> logistics <b>operations</b> of the US automakers. In our framework, we propose three potential levels for the US automakers to form outbound logistics collaboration: operational, tactical, and strategic. Our research proposition is to improve the performance of outbound logistics systems of automotive OEMs by means of horizontal collaboration between plants and competing OEMs. The proposed research thus relates to the literature on logistics system design and management and horizontal collaboration in supply chain management. The collaboration framework is demonstrated through a real world case study in US automotive industry. The contribution of this research is the introduction of a framework for intra- and inter-OEM collaboration and the development of novel logistics network design and flow models integrated with inventory models, lost sales, and expedited shipment. Besides the contribution to the academic literature, the proposed collaborative distribution system is a new concept in the automotive industry. Hence, this novel research work will also benefit to the practitioners.

Allocation of warehouse resources should be efficient and effective to achieve optimum productivity and reduce operational costs. Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a technology capable of providing real-time information about supply chain operations. It {{has been used by}} warehousing and logistic enterprises to achieve reduced shrinkage, improved material handling and tracking as well as increased accuracy of data collection. However, both academics and practitioners express concerns about challenges to RFID adoption in the supply chain. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the problems encountered in RFID implementation at warehouses, discussing the theoretical and practical adoption barriers and causes of not achieving full potential of the technology. Lack of foreseeable return on investment (ROI) and high costs are the most commonly reported obstacles. Variety of standards and radio wave frequencies are identified as source of concern for decision makers. Inaccurate performance of the RFID within the warehouse environment is examined. Description of integration challenges between warehouse management system and RFID technology is given. The paper discusses the existing solutions to technological, investment and performance RFID adoption barriers. Factors to consider when implementing the RFID technology are given to help alleviate implementation problems. By illustrating the challenges of RFID in the warehouse environment and discussing possible solutions the paper aims to help both academics and practitioners to focus on key areas constituting an obstacle to the technology growth.

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This testimony discusses federal efforts to stem currency smuggling across our nation's borders. Mexican drug-trafficking organizations, terrorist organizations, and other groups with malevolent intent finance their operations by moving funds into {{or out of the}} United States. For example, a common technique used for taking proceeds from drug sales in the United States to Mexico is a method known as bulk cash smuggling. The National Drug Intelligence Center (NDIC) has stated that proceeds from drug trafficking generated in this country are smuggled across the southwest border and it estimates that the proceeds total from $ 18 billion to $ 39 billion a year. NDIC also estimates that Canadian drug-trafficking organizations smuggle significant amounts of cash across the northern border from proceeds of drugs sold in the United States. In addition to bulk cash smuggling, 21 st century methods and technologies of laundering money have emerged. In 2009, NDIC stated that new financial products and technologies present unique opportunities for money launderers as well as unprecedented challenges to the intelligence, law enforcement, and regulatory communities. NDIC and others cited the use of prepaid cards or gift cards that are loaded with currency or value [...] also called stored value [...] as presenting a compact and easily transportable method to move money {{into and out of the}} United States. U. S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) [...] a major component in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) [...] is the lead federal agency in charge of securing our nation's borders. In March 2009, the Secretary of Homeland Security called on CBP to help stem the flow of bulk cash and weapons moving south by inspecting travelers leaving the United States for Mexico [...] an effort called <b>outbound</b> <b>operations.</b> In addition, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) [...] a bureau in the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) [...] seeks to deter and detect criminal activity and safeguard the financial system from the risk that terrorists and other criminals may fund their operations through financial institutions in the United States. Among other things, FinCEN is responsible for administering laws aimed at preventing criminals from abusing U. S. financial systems. This testimony is based on our October 2010 report on cross-border currency smuggling and updated information on bulk cash seizures and the status of one our recommendations. Like the report, it will cover the following three issues: (1) the actions CBP has taken to stem the flow of bulk cash leaving the country through land ports of entry and the challenges that remain, (2) the regulatory gaps that exist for cross-border reporting and other anti-money laundering requirements involving the use of stored value, and (3) the extent to which FinCEN has taken action to address these regulatory gaps. ...|$|E

40|$|As many manufacturers, retailers, distributors, and {{logistics}} firms adopt RFID, {{the technology is}} becoming pervasive in the supply chain. Although its advocates include retail giants such as Wal-Mart, not all companies are enthusiastic about its benefits.

To establish the real benefits of RFID, we conducted a field study with GENCO, a third-party logistics company that deployed RFID in the <b>outbound</b> logistics <b>operations</b> at one of its return centers. Our analysis found that the RFID implementation {{had a significant impact on}} the GENCO outbound process. The number of customer claims fell substantially following the RFID deployment.

40|$|Efficiency of <b>outbound</b> {{warehouse}} <b>operations</b> {{depends on}} the management of demand forecasts and associated labor planning. A case study in consumer electronics shows that warehouse management systematically over-forecasts actual orders, by 3 % on average and by 6 - 12 % in busy periods (at {{the end of each}} month and also in the months September, October, and November). A time series model that corrects order forecasts for the biases in preceding weeks reduces the bias to less than 2 %, both on average and also in busy periods. The arrangements with the labor provider imply potential benefits of intentional over- forecasting and the associated ample labor supply for the warehouse. As compared to under-forecasted days, labor productivity on over-forecasted days is higher by 12 % for loading activities and by 4 % for picking and total outbound activities. Similar productivity gains are found if unbiased forecasts are compared with the optimal bias obtained from non- linear models estimated from daily data on bias and labor efficiency. The positive effects of intentional over-forecasting on productivity are confirmed in a structural equations model. By following similar methodologies as described in this paper, warehouse managers can determine the amount of intentional forecast bias that works best for their situation. The information required for this kind of evidence-based labor management consists of historical data on order sizes, forecasts, and labor productivity, and the outcomes depend on the available hiring strategies and cost structures...|$|R
40|$|Emerging {{concerns}} about competitiveness induce {{a growing number}} of firms to outsource their <b>outbound</b> transportation <b>operations</b> to third-party logistics providers. The resulting {{increase in the number of}} actors often leads to sub-optimal supply chain actions due to the antagonistic nature of the economic objectives of the partners. With the aim of determining possible deviations from the optimal system performance in such supply chains, this study analyzes the contractual relation between a retailer and a third-party logistics provider (carrier) using game theoretical approaches. The partners of the studied supply chain play a Stackelberg game in which the retailer is the leader and the carrier is the follower. The retailer faces an uncertain demand and needs to supply his store from his warehouse. he has the option of not meeting all the demand but must satisfy at least a minimum proportion of the fi nall demand. On the other hand, the carrier has to determine the number of trucks needed to satisfy this demand before uncertainty is resolved. Once demand is realized, if the reserved transportation capacity is insufficient, the carrier also has the possibility to requisition trucks at a higher price. We modelise the problem and propose a contract having two parameters : the quantity of transported items and the number of truck used. In our settings, the retailer is the one that submits the contract and the carrier decides if he accepts it or not. We compare this situation with a centralized model where a single decision maker takes all the decisions. Peer reviewe...|$|R

First, the research work focuses on developing an efficient, scalable truck distribution system to help reduce transportation cost, while maintaining the service level and capacity constraints. In doing so, the paper examines the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), a NP-hard combinatorial optimization {{in the context of}} biopharmaceutical customer demand fulfillment process. The thesis presents a model developed to perform distribution center decisions, with Amgen North America market as case study. The second question addressed in this paper is a study on the number of distribution centers and possible locations. In a market with a certain geographic distribution of customers, and a desired number of distribution centers to operate, the analysis compares the different potential locations from standpoint of transportation cost, inventory level and site loading. The model is well suited for a company expanding into a new market to make decision on location of distribution centers to cater to a certain spread of customers in that region. The paper presents analyses for a real case study to provide contextual example, as well as more broad recommendations in the field.

(Logistics Management) Abstract: The South African {{pharmaceutical}} {{cold chain}} industry has a fundamental challenge in balancing the quality requirements, {{driven by the}} Medicines Control Council (MCC), within a constrained revenue model that caps the possible income from distribution activities through single exit pricing (SEP) regulations. This research seeks to understand the key challenges in the pharmaceutical cold chain industry. Through {{the use of a}} survey and cost analysis, both a qualitative and quantitative view of the research on the <b>outbound</b> distribution <b>operations</b> for fine distribution, distribution to pharmacies and hospitals, of cold chain pharmaceuticals were obtained. The research takes a structured approach to identifying relationships between various elements of the pharmaceutical cold chain, as well as ascertaining the key factors and risk ratings of these elements. This information was analysed to identify the key challenges in the pharmaceutical cold chain industry. Using the Lambert and Stock total cost model, a framework was developed to guide both the survey and cost analysis research. As both components were structured in this manner, these components could be cross-referenced for consistency. The findings of the research identified that there was a significant relationship between the outbound distribution and the quality elements of the supply chain. The most important key factors were determined to be transportation volume, product write-offs, cold room validation, duration of the cold chain packaging system, type of temperature monitoring equipment, and cold room and freezer storage. The key risks were identified as being in the transport, validation/qualification and cold chain packaging elements. The research concluded that quality elements related to the warehousing function are well controlled, while the highest risk is within the transportation element. The research successfully identified six key challenges all related to the transportation element of the pharmaceutical cold chain industry.

The adoption of green logistics management (GLM) presents an opportunity for Chinese manufacturing exporters to competently respond to the escalating expectation {{of the international community}} for resources conservation and to achieve environmental performance profitably. This study makes several important contributions to the literature on managing logistics with environmental considerations. First, the authors identify the components of GLM: (i) procedure-based practices, (ii) evaluation-based practices, (iii) partner-based practices, and (iv) general environmental management practices. Second, they relate GLM to environmental and operational performance in a developing country context. Third, they identify the institutional and operational antecedents that prompt the adoption of GLM by export-oriented manufacturing enterprises in China. Fourth, they examine the moderating effect of environmental regulatory pressure on the GLM-performance linkage. The results are based on a survey of manufacturing exporters in China. The commonly held view that economic motivation is related to the adoption of GLM is not supported. However, GLM positively affects both environmental and operational performance, and regulatory pressure enhances the GLM-performance relationship.

It was generally known that serious problems were encountered in current longan production and sale, especially the increased production cost. To understand the overall situation clearly, longan’s supply chain was evaluated using the Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model and value chain analysis. In-depth interviews were conducted with 73 supply chain members, covering farmers, middlemen, process operators, transporters and exporters, located in Chiang Mai, Lamphun and Bangkok. Performance of the longan supply chain members were evaluated based on four categories, namely, inbound logistics, <b>operations,</b> <b>outbound</b> logistics and supporting activities. It was found that the exporters had the highest score in every aspect of performance criteria whereas the farmers had the lowest score, especially in the outbound logistics part. The findings also showed that the major problem of this supply chain was due to oversupply of longan. It was therefore recommended that the members in the supply chain should have to manage and control the quantity of longan, so that demand and supply are balanced as well as to add value to the longan products by increasing information share between members.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{transferability}} {{and application of}} business-driven strategic thinking {{to that of a}} public sector context, namely national mapping organisations. These organisations exist throughout the world because the economies of the world require geospatial information to support economic and social growth. As such their strategic positioning within government is of prime importance. In South Africa, however, there is a paucity of knowledge in this regard and consequently triggered the research which forms the basis of this paper. A macro-environmental analysis suggests significant growth opportunities for the South African geospatial industry, fuelled by a micro-industry borne out of the 2010 Soccer World Cup event. A profile description of the characteristics of consequence, boundaries between the private and public the industry and expected changes reflect a large industry which is expanding at a rapid rate but is fragmented and displays a complex network-system of inter and intra-industry relationships. As such it is attracting increasing numbers of competitors but, as an industry, appears to be slow to adjust to technological advancement. An internal analysis of the value chain of the National Mapping Organisation (NMO), the single most important player in the local public sector geospatial industry, reveals significant value creation in its in- house activities. However, the external deconstructed <b>operations,</b> <b>outbound</b> logistics and procurement processes are not allowing the organisation to realise any benefits from efficiencies it may introduce. Key to achieving efficiencies lies in the human capital, which by all accounts, it is failing to retain. Future strategic thrusts for the NMO have been identified by constructing a SWOT model and by analysing its relative competitive strength. These thrusts were found to concentrate on actions and themes related to staff, communication, marketing, general management, production (cost and capacity) and product (quality and innovation). Interpreting and applying those themes on an interorganisational basis will enable the NMO to best position itself in the industry. In this regard sufficient related strategic fit is evident between the value chains of the NMO, The Satellite Application Centre (SAC) and Statistics South Africa (Stats SA), enabling the NMO to leverage on the sales, marketing and distribution activities of SAC and the financial leveraging capabilities of Stats SA. This paper has presented an example of how delivering an efficient and effective service delivery may be hampered through the inappropriate strategic configuration of South African public sector activities. It is therefore suggested that the government revisits the strategic positioning of public sector organisations engaged in the provision of geospatial information. Articl...|$|R
