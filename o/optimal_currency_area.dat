40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{empirical evidence}} {{on the effectiveness of}} movements in nominal exchange rates in smoothing cyclical imbalances between countries, as explained by the literature on <b>optimal</b> <b>currency</b> <b>areas.</b> We use restrictions from the Mundell-Flemming model (on which the theory of <b>optimal</b> <b>currency</b> <b>areas</b> is based) to identify VAR systems that explain the exchange rate movements and the relative output movements of potential members of a European Monetary Union (EMU). We find that the shocks that cause most of the variation in relative output do not seem to result in movements in nominal exchange rates. Moreover, the shocks that explain movements in nominal exchange rates are monetary in nature, rather than real. Such results make it hard to argue that the loss of exchange rate flexibility accompanying EMU would come at a significant cost to macroeconomic stability.

Thus, in contradiction to what is generally assumed {{on the basis of the}} reduction in transaction costs only, the European Monetary Union (EMU) is likely to foster intra-industry trade in Europe, leading to more symmetric shocks between member states.

40|$|The {{theory of}} optimal {{currency}} areas, due to Mundell and McKinnon, {{has enjoyed a}} revival {{of interest in the}} wake of European discussions of monetary union. The basic theme of this old literature is that there are potential gains for stabilization policy in an independent exchange rate and money because rigidity of prices causes an inadequate response of relative prices to shocks. This theme has been taken up recently in empirical work on fixed versus floating exchange rates. This paper examines whether there is support for it in the microfoundations of linked open economies. It uses the cash-in-advance general equilibrium approach of Lucas, following along the lines of Canzoneri and Diba, but focuses on instability and its costs rather than optimal transformation ratios. It finds support for the insights of the <b>optimal</b> <b>currency</b> <b>area</b> literature. The result comes from the cash-in-advance constraint, which causes labour supply to respond to expected inflation (and so money growth) between this and the next period: the household faces an inevitable delay between working (receiving cash) and being able to spend the proceeds. This delay is the microfoundation analogue of the `nominal (price) rigidity' in the <b>optimal</b> <b>currency</b> <b>area</b> models. Though the direction of money supply responses is orthodox (counter-cyclical), however, {{it is not clear whether}} it stabilizes prices (though it probably stabilizes output). By contrast, in the empirical work stability has been gauged by the variance of output and prices. Hence this microfoundations model, though in a way supporting the <b>optimal</b> <b>currency</b> <b>area</b> literature, does not mimic what that literature regards as `the real world'.

40|$|A popular {{suggestion}} among emerging or transition economies is to 'dollarize' or 'euro-ize'; that is {{to adopt}} the currency of a larger, richer neighbour in order to import the monetary discipline and financial stability of that neighbour. This paper examines {{the pros and cons}} of that suggestion in Argentina, where it has become a serious political concern. We argue that the usual <b>Optimal</b> <b>Currency</b> <b>Area</b> criteria, while important, may not be the dominant consideration where a currency board, or where exchange rate fixing or stabilization, is the natural alternative. This is because such a fixing arrangement creates risk premia against the possibility that the exchange rate parity cannot be maintained, and against the possibility that the domestic economy will be unable or unwilling to fund the bonds, securities or reserves used to back the domestic currency issue. We find the growth and investment benefits of removing the risk premia outweigh any <b>optimal</b> <b>currency</b> <b>area</b> difficulties. But that produces its own difficulties in that there may be a conflict between the need to develop an economy's real side, which depends on the <b>optimal</b> <b>currency</b> <b>area</b> criteria, and the conditions of financial stability needed to realize that developments depend on the discipline effects from outside that currency area.

Since the exchange rate represents the relative price of two currencies, commonness of stochastic trends between the fundamental determinants {{of supply and demand}} of the underlying monies restricts exchange rate movements to transitory fluctuations. In the spirit of <b>optimal</b> <b>currency</b> <b>areas,</b> this has the potential to serve as a criterion for an all-round integration of two economies.
