40|$|The {{measurement}} of the heats of formation of organo-metallic com-pounds presents, usually, a difficult task to the experimental thermochemist.

40|$|The {{reaction}} of Electrolytic Manganese Dioxide (EMD γ-MnO 2) with anhydrous LiOH in ethylene glycol (EG) was studied. It {{was found that}} this reaction proceeds in three steps while the reaction temperature increases: (1) Chemical insertion of lithium in γ-MnO 2 structure leading to γ-Li(x) MnO 2 phase, (2) progressive dissolution of this reduced phase and (3) precipitation of a Li-free <b>organo-metallic</b> <b>compound</b> Mn(OCH 2 CH 2 O) with lamellar structure (Mn-EG). If the reaction is performed at moderate temperature (T < 120 °C), we can limit the dissolution reaction and completely avoid the precipitation of the organo-metallic phase. The x value in the resulting Li(x) MnO 2 phases {{is found to be}} mainly linked to the temperature of the reaction medium. Although a maximum value of x = 0. 35 can be obtained at 30 °C, Li 0. 84 MnO 2 can be prepared at 120 °C. We showed that the Li(x) MnO 2 formation mechanism consists of a direct lithium insertion in the structure of MnO 2 concomitant with Mn reduction by the organic medium. By changing the medium cationic content of the medium, we were able to prepare various reduced MnO 2 compositions, such as H(x) MnO 2, (Li,H) (x) MnO 2, (Na,H) (x) MnO 2, (K,H) (x) MnO 2.

In the present investigation the interaction of (-) -menthyl esters of o-acetyl fatty acids and phenyl magnesium bromide has been studied {{with a view to}} obtaining asymmetric synthesis and to relating this to the length of the chain intervening between the carbonyl and carbomenthoxy groups. The investigation has entailed the preparation of the above type of esters when n = 0, 2, 3, 4 and 8, and their treatment with phenyl magnesium bromide. The hydroxy-acids or (with n = 2 and 3) lactones, obtained after hydrolysis of the resulting esters, were opticallyactive, except in the case of n = 8. With n = 2 or 3, the degree of asymmetric synthesis was dependent on reaction conditions. The addition of a Grignard reagent to a carbonyl group has previously been found to occur asymmetrically only when the carbonyl group is in a molecule containing, a "fixed centre of asymmetry". It has now been found that an asymmetric reaction occurs when an optically active <b>organo-metallic</b> <b>compound</b> adds to a ketone.

The sum of the six organotins in raw water and drinking water ranged from 33. 3 to 476. 9 ng Sn L- 1 and from no detection to 142. 4 ng Sn L- 1, respectively. The highest concentration of triphenyltin in drinking water and raw water were 41. 3, 44. 6 ng Sn L- 1, and those for tri-butyltin were 32. 1, 37. 6 ng Sn L- 1, respectively, which were observed from April to July. Conventional treatment processes and advanced treatment processes could not remove organotins completely. Keywords Drinking water Tributyltin Triphenyltin Advanced treatment Organotin compounds, especially tributyltin (TBT) and triphenyltin (TPT) have been proven to be highly toxic to aqueous life and disturb the cell energy metabolism (Fent 1996) and the endocrine especially for dogwhelk (Nucella lapillus; Gibbs et al. 1991 a). TBT and TPT pollution are known to induce various symptoms on the affected organisms, like failure of spat in oysters (Alzieu et al. 1986), impotence in neogastropods and gastropods (Bryan et al. 1988; Gibbs et al. 1991 b) and reduction of the dog-whelk population (Gibbs et al. 1991 a). Organotins are also hazardous to humans, and butyltin and phenyltin com-pounds are both immunotoxic to human NK (natural killer) cells under in vitro experiments (Whalen et al. 2000). The estimated tolerable daily intake (TDI) value for TBTO and TPT acetate is 0. 25 lg kg- 1 body weight as prescribed by the World Health Organization (WHO 1999) and 0. 4 lg per kg body weight as prescribed by the German Federal Institute for Health Protection of Consumers and Veteri-nary Medicine (BGVV 2000), respectively.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{environmental}} effects of volcanic eruptions such as Eyjafjallajökull (2010) from which volcanic gases and ash particles can impact upon ecosystems located thousands of kilometres from the source. Currently very {{little is known about}} the impact of volcanic pollutants such as SO 4 and F on the carbon cycle. This study is a first step towards understanding the potential environmental impacts of volcanic eruptions on peatland and mineral soil C gas fluxes. Ombrotrophic peat mesocosms sampled from the Northern Peninne uplands, UK, were dosed over 20 weeks with concentrations of SO 4 -S (24. 5 kg ha- 1) and F (13. 5 and 135 kg ha- 1) simulating a distal Icelandic tephra deposit. Methane and CO 2 gas fluxes were measured at regular intervals, but no significant differences were observed for any of the treatments when compared to the controls. This result contrasts with previous studies, which reported a suppression of CH 4 emission with the addition of SO 4. It can be explained if CH 4 production has remained suppressed in the peat soils as a long-term consequence of heavy SO 4 loadings in the Pennines area prior to the reduction of SO 2 emissions from industrial sources in the 1970 s. The mesocosm study results indicate that F deposition, at rates representative of tephra fallout does not interfere with C gas fluxes in peat soils, despite the well-established toxicity of F in the environment. However, F addition to a pristine peat soil in laboratory slurry experiments showed an increase in potential CH 4 production rates thus further research is recommended. Addition of treatments containing high concentrations of F to peat mesocosms had a significant effect on soil solution chemistry. The addition of F increased the solubility of Al, Fe and acetate resulting in the accumulation of both species in solution near the peat surface. This build up of acetate, Al and Fe over the treatment period suggests that F breaks down <b>organo-metallic</b> <b>compounds</b> causing leaching of organic matter along with metal ions. This may have important implications for microbial communities within the peat that are associated with decomposition of organic matter and carbon cycling. After the 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull, Iceland, a field experiment was carried out to assess the impact of tephra deposition on soil respiration from a grassland site. The results showed that the chemical effect of ash leaching resulted in a 30 % reduction in ecosystem respiration. This study also highlighted the short-term physical effects of tephra deposition on the release of CO 2 from soil as the tephra layer impeded CO 2 release when wet. This work provides a useful contribution to the scientific understanding of the effects of volcanic SO 4 and F on peatland ecosystems and the physical and chemical effects of ash deposition on soil respiration. Consideration of the impact of volcanic deposition on soil C fluxes in climate models is required in order to be able to fully appreciate how volcanism causes environmental changes.

This universal response can also be induced by a variety of stressors, including heavy metal ions and organic and <b>organo-metallic</b> <b>compounds.</b> As a result, the stress response has recently attracted the attention of ecotoxicologists for use in environmental biomonitoring. In the present study, we have investigated the stress responses of two different organisms; namely the free-living soil nematode Caenorhiabdities elegans(both wild-type and transgenic strains) and the freshwater crustacea Asellus aquazicus. We have also explored the possible use of these model systems in environmental monitoring using different techniques which include metabolic labelling with subsequent one-dimensional electrophoresis and autoradiography, and one- or two-dimensional western blotting using antibodies specific to stress protein 70. The study with A. aquaticus shows that this organism exhibits a classical stress response. The exposure of asellids to heat shock-treatment (26 °C; 13 °C above the standard maintenance temperature) or to sublethal concentrations of metal ions (Cd++ and Cu++) resulted in the induction of at least 5 putative HSPs which belong to several major HSP families (HSP 100, HSP 90 and possibly HSP 60). An increase in the synthesis of smaller sizes of polypeptides (25 - 35 kD) should be also noted. Moreover, the time-course of heat versus heavy metal stress-response in this organism suggests that the pattern of stress-protein synthesis changes considerably with increasing exposure time; notably the response to heat is more transient than that to heavy metals. However, HSP 70 {{does not appear to be}} the major stress protein induced in this organism. The presence of low molecular weight (LMW) proteins which react with anti-HSP 70 antibodies and the apparent deficiency of classical 70 kD stress proteins in A. aquaticus, both suggest that HSP 70 s in this organism are for some reason prone to degradation. In the nematode C. elegans, shifting the culture temperature from 20 °C to 34 °C induces the synthesis of a set of HSPs corresponding to the HSP 90, HSP 70 and small HSP families. There are at least nine members of the hsp 7 O multigene family in C. elegans; some members are expressed constitutively while others are stress inducible. W e have studied the effects of heat and heavy metal (cadmium) stress on the expression patterns of the HSP 70 protein family in the nematodes by one- and two-dimensional Western blotting using a monoclonal anti-HSP 70 antibody that recognises a conserved epitope shared by most HSP 70 family members. Constitutive C. elegans HSP 70 s (expressed at 20 °C) are almost undetectable on one-dimensional immunoblots, but chemiluminescent probing of two-dimensional blots reveals a complex pattern of several HSP 70 s pots. Mild heats hock at 31 ° C induces a doublet HSP 70 band on one-dimensional blots, of which the heavier component (75 kD) is more prominent than the lighter (73 kD). On two-dimensional blots, this pattern is shown to be more complex with a prominent 75 kD spot newly induced and several other spots intensified. Severe heat shock at 34 °C strongly induces both 75 and 73 kD bands on one-dimensional blots; two dimensional analysis reveals a series of novel and/or elevated 73 and 75 kD spots. Treatment with cadmium(16 ppm) at 31 ° C gives a different pattern of spots as compared with 31 °C alone; several spots show enhanced while some are newly expressed, and not all of these are present at 34 °C. These results indicate that related members of the HSP 70 protein family in C. elegans are independently regulated in response to different forms of stress. The possible significance of these findings is discussed in relation to the possible use of stress responses s environmental biomonitors. We have also utilised a stress-inducible C. elegans strain (CB 4027) for monitoring environmental contamination. This transgenic strain carries integrated copies of the Drosophila hsp 70 promoter fused to an E. coli lacZ reporter gene. When exposed to heat shock or to several environmentally relevant stressors, the transgenic strain expresses the reporter product, 3 -galactosidase, which can easily be quantified or localised in situ in stained worms or on Western blots (apparently enzymatically active as a 170 kD form). We have exposed transgenic worms to a variety of toxicants at an elevated temperature (32 °C) just below that required for heat shock (34 °C), in order to obtain optimal transgene induction. Exposure of nematodes to several heavy metals (e. g. Cd+, Hg++, Zn+, Sn++, Mn++ and Ag+), organometallic toxicants (tributyltin) or organic pollutants (lindane) induces ß-galactosidase expression in a dose-dependent manner. Cadmium is found to be by far the strongest inducer of transgene activity amongst the agents tested, although tributyltin is an effective inducer at ppb levels. The effects of mixtures of divalent metal ions (Cd++/Ca++, Cd++/Zn++ and Cd++/Hg++) on ß-galactosidase expression have been also investigated. All three divalent ions tested in combination with cadmium significantly inhibit cadmium-induced transgene activity in comparison to cadmium alone. In the case of Cd++/C++ mixtures, a marked inhibition of Cd++ accumulation by worm tissues has also been demonstrated, directly related to the Ca++ concentration. These effects may represent competition for metal-ion uptake through calcium channels. Our results show that this transgenic system works well within strictly defined assay conditions, and can detect clear responses over a 7 h exposure period to environmentally relevant toxicants at sublethal concentrations well below the 24 or 48 h LCSO values. However, there is a need for careful characterisation and containment of any transgenic organism if it is to be used as environmental monitoring tool...|$|R
