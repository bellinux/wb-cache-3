In the Old Kingdom, pharaohs gave this authority first to their relatives and then to their viziers. In the reign of Thutmose III the office passed from the viziers to the High Priests of Amun, who held it {{for much of the}} New Kingdom. The Romans established a similar <b>office,</b> <b>that</b> of the high priest for all Egypt, which oversaw the temple cults until their extinction.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{resolution}} {{was not as}} strong as Mason had liked—he wanted Virginia to threaten to cut off tobacco—Mason worked in the following years for non-importation. The repeal of most of the Townshend duties (excepting that on tea) made his task more difficult. In March 1773, his wife Ann died of illness contracted after another pregnancy. Mason was the sole parent to nine children, and his commitments made him even more reluctant to accept political <b>office</b> <b>that</b> would take him from Gunston Hall.|$|E
5|$|Anti-corruption {{officers}} were aided unwittingly by Ao, who kept details of every illegal transaction and the kickbacks he received in a notebook.

Ho said between 2004 and 2006, he paid Ao about HK$140 million in kickbacks, for private projects only. During the trial, 7 witnesses, including Ho, went missing.|$|E
5|$|As of the {{election}} of Vincent Schoemehl as the city's youngest mayor ever in 1981, St. Louis's problems were more significant than many other rustbelt cities. Several major development projects incomplete and the city's economic base crumbling. However, Schoemehl developed two projects early in his three terms in <b>office</b> <b>that</b> assisted St. Louis: Operation Brightside provided city beautification through plantings and graffiti cleanup. Schoemehl also instituted a safety program to address crime, known as Operation SafeStreet, which blocked access to certain through streets and provided low-cost security measures to homeowners. Crime declined starting in 1984, and despite a small resurgence in 1989, continued to decline through the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{creation}} of the Canadian Heraldic Authority, Canadians wishing to obtain a legally granted coat of arms had to apply to one of the two heraldic offices in the United Kingdom: either the College of Arms in London or, if of Scottish descent, the Court of the Lord Lyon in Edinburgh. This process was quite lengthy—and costly. In addition, the heralds in Britain could sometimes be unfamiliar with Canadian history and symbols. In time, many Canadians with an interest in heraldry began calling for an <b>office</b> <b>that</b> would offer armorial bearings designed by and for Canadians.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{projects}} such as these constituted only the most visible part of Domitian's religious policy, which also concerned itself with the fulfilment of religious law and public morals. In 85, he nominated himself perpetual censor, the <b>office</b> <b>that</b> held the task of supervising Roman morals and conduct. Once again, Domitian acquitted himself of this task dutifully, and with care. He renewed the Lex Iulia de Adulteriis Coercendis, under which adultery was punishable by exile. From the list of jurors he struck an equestrian who had divorced his wife and taken her back, while an ex-quaestor was expelled from the Senate for acting and dancing.|$|E
5|$|He {{then joined}} the cabinet during a 2004 reshuffle, {{serving as the}} Norwegian Minister of the Environment from summer 2004 to fall 2005. He was the {{youngest}} ever cabinet member from the Christian Democratic Party, and the first Christian Democratic to hold the post. The second cabinet Bondevik did not survive the 2005 elections, and as such Hareide had to step down from <b>office</b> <b>that</b> year. His successor was Helen Bjørnøy. Until 2009, Hareide had never been elected to the Norwegian Parliament, but served as a deputy representative during the terms 19972001, 20012005 and 20052009. On the local level of politics {{he was a member}} of Bømlo municipality council from 1991 to 1995.|$|E

5|$|Himmler {{discussed}} {{plans with}} his subordinates to integrate {{at least the}} German-speaking parts of Switzerland completely {{with the rest of}} Germany, and had several persons in mind for the post of a Reichskommissar for the 're-union' of Switzerland with the German Reich (in analogy to the <b>office</b> <b>that</b> Josef Bürckel held after Austria's absorption into Germany during the Anschluss). Later this official was to subsequently become the new Reichsstatthalter of the area after completing its total assimilation. In August 1940, Gauleiter of Westfalen-South Josef Wagner and the Minister President of Baden Walter Köhler spoke in favor of the amalgamation of Switzerland to Reichsgau Burgund (see below) and suggested that the seat of government for this new administrative territory should be the dormant Palais des Nations in Geneva.|$|E

Oberlin College did not share all of these sentiments.|$|E
5|$|Judge Appleby also {{threatened}} Kunstler with dismissal {{and contempt}} of court after he delivered an October 21, 1976 speech at nearby Rutgers University that in part discussed the upcoming trial, but later ruled that Kunstler could represent Shakur. Until obtaining a court order, Williams was forced to strip naked and undergo a body search before each visit with Shakur—during which Shakur was shackled to a bed by both ankles. Judge Appleby also refused to investigate a burglary of her defense counsel's <b>office</b> <b>that</b> resulted in the disappearance of trial documents, amounting to half of the legal papers related to her case. Her lawyers also claimed that their offices were bugged.|$|E

5|$|Leiva wrote a {{constitutional}} code {{to regulate the}} actions of the Junta.

The commanders of the armed forces, including Saavedra and Pedro Andrés García, agreed to this code. The Junta swore the oath of <b>office</b> <b>that</b> afternoon.|$|E
5|$|Of {{concern to}} the Home Office were an {{undisclosed}} number of letters that it had received objecting to Colbung's involvement in the repatriation process; it therefore sought assurances from the Australian Government that Colbung was a correct applicant. In response Colbung asked his elders to ask the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) to tell the British Home <b>Office</b> <b>that</b> he was the correct applicant. ATSIC then convened a meeting in Perth at which it was again resolved that Colbung's application could proceed.|$|E
