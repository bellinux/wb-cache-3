40|$|It {{has long}} been {{understood}} that the transposition of data from printouts to data collection sheets, and the subsequent manipulation of this data with measurement values, is an obvious error source in <b>optical</b> <b>tooling</b> projects. Ideas for computerized data collection have been under consideration for some time, yet they lacked the versatility needed {{for even the most}} typical <b>optical</b> <b>tooling</b> jobs. Surveyors experienced with <b>optical</b> <b>tooling</b> were used to designing the measurement strategy that worked best for each job. There was no canned formula that worked with every case. After extensive field testing a program was developed that worked in as many cases as possible.

50|$|One of {{the clearest}} {{examples}} of this advantage {{is the use of}} mechanical probing techniques which require a direct physical interaction with the sample. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been used to image lipid phase separation, formation of transmembrane nanopores followed by single protein molecule adsorption, and protein assembly with sub-nm accuracy without the need for a labeling dye. More recently, AFM has also been used to directly probe the mechanical properties of single bilayers and to perform force spectroscopy on individual membrane proteins. These studies would be difficult or impossible without the use of supported bilayers since the surface of a cell or vesicle is relatively soft and would drift and fluctuate over time. Another example of a physical probe is the use of the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) to study binding kinetics at the bilayer surface. Dual polarisation interferometry is a high resolution <b>optical</b> <b>tool</b> for characterising the order and disruption in lipid bilayers during interactions or phase transitions providing complementary data to QCM measurements.|$|E

40|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>tools</b> {{respond to}} {{internal}} vibration {{that can be}} excited by the external acoustic environment. The degree to which this occurs depends on many factors, but primarily the correspondence between the resonance characteristics of the tool and the frequency content of the acoustic environment in which it operates. Adverse noise environments, such as those often found in operating laboratories and microelectronics fabrication facilities, can affect the threshold of resolution achievable by the tool. This paper reviews the (typically somewhat inadequate) state of noise specification for <b>optical</b> <b>tools,</b> and the noise levels in typical spaces in which these are intended to operate. Manufacturer’s noise specifications often overstate or understate the sensitivity of their tool when the noise sensitivity criterion is oversimplified.

40|$|AbstractA {{series of}} new {{fluorescent}} Zinpyr (ZP) chemosensors {{based on the}} fluorescein platform have been prepared and evaluated for imaging neuronal Zn 2 +. A systematic synthetic survey of electronegative substitution patterns on a homologous ZP scaffold provides a basis for tuning the fluorescence responses of “off-on” photoinduced electron transfer (PET) probes by controlling fluorophore pKa values and attendant proton-induced interfering fluorescence of the metal-free (apo) probes at physiological pH. We further establish {{the value of these}} improved <b>optical</b> <b>tools</b> for interrogating the metalloneurochemistry of Zn 2 +; the novel ZP 3 fluorophore images endogenous stores of Zn 2 + in live hippocampal neurons and slices, including the first fluorescence detection of Zn 2 + in isolated dentate gyrus cultures. Our findings reveal that careful control of fluorophore pKa can minimize proton-induced fluorescence of the apo probes and that electronegative substitution offers a general strategy for tuning PET chemosensors for cellular studies. In addition to providing improved <b>optical</b> <b>tools</b> for Zn 2 + in the neurosciences, these results afford a rational starting point for creating superior fluorescent probes for biological applications...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{fertilization}} {{management is}} a way of bringing nutrients to the plant when they are crucial for its development. However, destructive measure- ments of crop nitrogen (N) status are still too costly and time consuming to justify their use, and the implementation of methodologies based on non-destructive, quick, and easy to use tools for plant nutritional status monitoring appears as an appealing opportunity. Several <b>optical</b> <b>tools</b> for plant monitoring have been developed in recent years, and many studies have assessed their ability to discrim- inate plant N status. Such tools can measure at leaf level (hand-held optical instruments) or may consider the canopy of a plant or few plants (portable radiometers) or even measure areas, such as a field, a farm, or a region (aerial photography). The application of vegetation indices, which combine the readings at different wavelengths, may improve the reliability of the collected data, giving a more precise determination of the plant nutritional status. In this article, we report {{on the state of the}} art of the available <b>optical</b> <b>tools</b> for plant N status monitoring...|$|R

In this study, we demonstrate that two-photon excited reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) fluorescence provides imaging contrast to distinguish granulocyte and agranulocyte. By using spectral and time-resolved NADH fluorescence, we study the immune response of human neutrophils against bacterial infection (Escherichia coli). The two-photon excited NADH fluorescence images clearly review the morphological changes from resting neutrophils (round shape) to activated neutrophils (ruffle shape) during phagocytosis.

40|$|Unique {{features}} of Light-Oxygen-Voltage (LOV) proteins like relatively small size (~ 12 - 19 [*]kDa), inherent modularity, highly-tunable photocycle and oxygen-independent fluorescence have lately been exploited for {{the generation of}} <b>optical</b> <b>tools.</b> Structures of LOV domains reported so far contain a flavin chromophore per protein molecule. Here we report two new findings on the short LOV protein W 619 _ 1 -LOV from Pseudomonas putida. First, the apo-state crystal structure of W 619 _ 1 -LOV at 2. 5 [*]Å resolution reveals conformational rearrangements in the secondary structure elements lining the chromophore pocket including elongation of the Fα helix, shortening of the Eα-Fα loop and partial unfolding of the Eα helix. Second, the apo W 619 _ 1 -LOV protein binds both natural and structurally modified flavin chromophores. Remarkably different photophysical and photochemical properties of W 619 _ 1 -LOV bound to 7 -methyl- 8 -chloro-riboflavin (8 -Cl-RF) and lumichrome imply application of these variants as novel <b>optical</b> <b>tools</b> as they offer advantages such as no adduct state formation, and a broader choice of wavelengths for in vitro studies...|$|R
