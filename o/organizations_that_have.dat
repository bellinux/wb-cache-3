25|$|In {{addition}} to the education sector, there are non-governmental sectors or <b>organizations</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> {{a significant effect on}} language acquisition, such as the Académie française of France or the Real Academia Española of Spain.

25|$|Reverse money {{laundering}} {{is a process}} that disguises a legitimate source of funds that are to be used for illegal purposes. It is usually perpetrated for the purpose of financing terrorism but can be also used by criminal <b>organizations</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> invested in legal businesses and would like to withdraw legitimate funds from official circulation. Unaccounted cash received via disguising financial transactions is not included in official financial reporting and could be used to evade taxes, hand in bribes and pay “under-the-table” salaries. For example, in an affidavit filed 24 March 2014 in United States District Court, Northern California, San Francisco Division, FBI special agent Emmanuel V. Pascau alleged that several people associated with the Chee Kung Tong organization, and California State Senator Leland Yee, engaged in reverse {{money laundering}} activities.|$|E

25|$|With {{health care}} {{knowledge}} growing steadily, nurses can {{stay ahead of}} the curve through continuing education. Continuing education classes and programs enable nurses to provide the best possible care to patients, advance nursing careers, and keep up with Board of Nursing requirements. The American Nurses Association and the American Nursing Credentialing Center are devoted to ensuring nurses have access to quality continuing education offerings. Continuing education classes are calibrated to provide enhanced learning for all levels of nurses. Many States also regulate Continuing Nursing Education. Nursing licensing boards requiring Continuing Nursing Education (CNE) as a condition for licensure, either initial or renewal, accept courses provided by organizations that are accredited by other state licensing boards, by the American Nursing Credentialing Center (ANCC), or by <b>organizations</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> been designated as an approver of continuing nursing education by ANCC. There are some exceptions to this rule including the state of California, Florida and Kentucky. National Healthcare Institute has created a list to assist nurses in determining their CNE credit hours requirements. While this list is not all inclusive, it offers details on how to contact nursing licensing boards directly.|$|E
25|$|There {{have also}} been {{multiple}} international groups that have issued reports addressing issues in special education. The United Nations on “International Norms and Standards relating to Disability” in 1998. This report cites multiple conventions, statements, declarations, and other reports such as: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, The Salamanca Statement, the Sundberg Declaration, the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action, and many others. One main point that the report emphasizes is the necessity for education {{to be a human}} right. The report also states that the “quality of education should be equal to that of persons without disabilities.” The other main points brought up by the report discuss integrated education, special education classes as supplementary, teacher training, and equality for vocational education. The United Nations also releases a report by the Special Rapporteur that has a focus on persons with disabilities. In 2015, a report titled “Report of the Special Rapporteur to the 52nd Session of the Commission for Social Development: Note by the Secretary-General on Monitoring of the implementation of the Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities” was released. This report focused on looking at how the many countries involved, with a focus on Africa, have handled policy regarding persons with disabilities. In this discussion, the author also focuses on the importance of education for persons with disabilities as well as policies that could help improve the education system such as a move towards a more inclusive approach. The World Health Organization has also published a report addressing people with disabilities and within this there is a discussion on education in their “World Report on Disability” in 201. Other <b>organizations</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> issued reports discussing the topic are UNESCO, UNICEF, and the World Bank.|$|E

500|$|Significant {{controversy}} surrounds female {{genital mutilation}} (FGM), with the World Health Organization (WHO) {{being one of}} many health <b>organizations</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> campaigned against the procedures on behalf of human rights, stating that [...] "FGM has no health benefits" [...] {{and that it is}} [...] "a violation of the human rights of girls and women" [...] and [...] "reflects deep-rooted inequality between the sexes". The practice has existed at one point or another in almost all human civilizations, most commonly to exert control over the sexual behavior, including masturbation, of girls and women, but also to change the clitoris's appearance. Custom and tradition are the most frequently cited reasons for FGM, with some cultures believing that not performing it has the possibility of disrupting the cohesiveness of their social and political systems, such as FGM also being a part of a girl's initiation into adulthood. Often, a girl is not considered an adult in a FGM-practicing society unless she has undergone FGM, and the [...] "removal of the clitoris and labia– viewed by some as the male parts of a woman's body– is thought to enhance the girl's femininity, often synonymous with docility and obedience".|$|E
500|$|Further {{warning against}} [...] "political {{cannibalism}} between independentists", the Macheteros told their counterparts {{that it was}} their [...] "obligation {{to be at the}} forefront of every manifestation and protest" [...] against the Fortuño administration. After citing that their call for unity was a response to those times, the EBP expressed concern at the possibility of forcing a general strike without a tactical plan capable of replacing any protestors that may be incarcerated or killed and a list of demands. The organization also distanced itself from pro-independence <b>organizations</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> expressed their belief that more visibility in international organizations means that their goal is closer than ever before, stating that [...] " [...] must show [...] how far [...] are willing to go". The EBP also criticized independence supporters that cooperate with the free association movement in some converging points, since despite seeking a non-territorial resolution to the status issue the soberanistas do not pursue or believe in independence. Despite this assessment, the Macheteros called for a truce that would unite the left, citing that in the vigils organized by the PRTP and them through the Coordinadora Nacional de las Vigilias por la Dignidad Filiberto Ojeda Ríos the 23rd day of every months are attended by people from all of the independentist spectrum.|$|E
