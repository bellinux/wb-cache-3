Brock escapes to hunt the symbiote, which has gone on a killing spree to obtain brains. He reunites with the symbiote (after finding an alternative source <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chemical),</b> but Paine steals the symbiote for himself. Brock frees the symbiote, and again becomes Venom.|$|E
5|$|Compounds {{containing}} tantalum {{are rarely}} {{encountered in the}} laboratory. The metal is highly biocompatible and is used for body implants and coatings, therefore attention may be focused on other elements or the physical nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chemical</b> compound.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{predictions}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chemical</b> {{properties of}} rutherfordium {{were based on}} calculations which indicated that the relativistic effects on the electron shell might be strong enough that the 7p orbitals would have a lower energy level than the 6d orbitals, giving it a valence electron configuration of 6d1 7s2 7p1 or even 7s2 7p2, therefore making the element behave more like lead than hafnium. With better calculation methods and experimental studies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chemical</b> properties of rutherfordium compounds it could be shown that this does not happen and that rutherfordium instead behaves {{like the rest of}} the group 4 elements.|$|E

5|$|A period 1 {{element is}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chemical</b> {{elements}} {{in the first row}} (or period) of the periodic table <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chemical</b> elements. The periodic table is laid out in rows to illustrate periodic (recurring) trends in the chemical behaviour of the elements as their atomic number increases: a new row is begun when chemical behaviour begins to repeat, meaning that elements with similar behaviour fall into the same vertical columns. The first period contains fewer elements than any other row in the table, with only two: hydrogen and helium. This situation can be explained by modern theories of atomic structure. In a quantum mechanical description of atomic structure, this period corresponds to the filling of the 1s orbital. Period 1 elements obey the duet rule in that they need two electrons to complete their valence shell. The maximum number of electrons that these elements can accommodate is two, both in the 1s orbital. Therefore, period 1 can have only two elements.|$|E

Some fruit bodies smell of creosote, an odor that {{becomes even more}} prevalent if the {{mushrooms are}} cooked. Cooking also introduces an unpleasant soapy-metallic flavor.

5|$|All three stable {{elements}} {{occur in}} heavy mineral sands ore deposits, which are placer deposits formed, most usually in beach environments, by concentration {{due to the}} specific gravity of the mineral grains of erosion material from mafic and ultramafic rock. The titanium minerals are mostly anatase and rutile, and zirconium occurs in the mineral zircon. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chemical</b> similarity, up to 5% of the zirconium in zircon is replaced by hafnium. The largest producers of the group 4 elements are Australia, South Africa and Canada.|$|E
5|$|At this time, the {{efficacy}} of the Chapman–Jouguet model was still in doubt, and it was the subject of studies by John von Neumann at the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study. Kistiakowsky realized that the deviations from hydrodynamic theory were the result of the speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chemical</b> reactions themselves. To control the reaction, calculations down to the microsecond level were needed. Section 8 was drawn into the investigation of shaped charges, whose mechanism was explained by Taylor and James Tuck in 1943.|$|E

5|$|Enzyme {{kinetics}} is {{the study}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chemical</b> reactions that are catalysed by enzymes.

Twenty-six elements have only a single stable isotope, while the largest number of stable isotopes observed for any element is ten, for the element tin. Elements 43, 61, and all elements numbered 83 or higher have no stable isotopes.|$|E

5|$|In {{his report}} on The Periodic Law <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chemical</b> Elements in 1869, the Russian chemist Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev {{predicted}} {{the existence of}} several unknown chemical elements, including one that would fill {{a gap in the}} carbon family in his Periodic Table of the Elements, located between silicon and tin.

5|$|In {{his report}} on The Periodic Law <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chemical</b> Elements, in 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev had implicitly {{predicted}} {{the existence of}} a heavier analog of titanium and zirconium.

The exact placement of the elements and the location of missing elements was done by determining the specific weight of the elements and comparing the chemical and physical properties.|$|E
