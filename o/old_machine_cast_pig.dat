40|$|Die casting is {{a common}} method of light metal {{processing}} {{which is used to}} produce accurately dimensioned, sharply defined metal parts. Most die <b>casting</b> <b>machines</b> in use today utilize a complex hydraulic system to perform the necessary work required for the process. The pressure and flow rate demands on the hydraulic system vary significantly throughout the cycle. Many older systems are greatly oversized so that they are able to meet the peak hydraulic demand at any point. These systems operate inefficiently because there is typically no way to limit the hydraulic capacity during periods of low demand. As a result, fluid is throttled to lower pressures and excess fluid flow is routed directly back to the system reservoir, wasting motor energy and increasing the thermal load on the cooling system. One option for improving the efficiency of <b>older</b> die <b>casting</b> <b>machines</b> currently in use is the retrofit of an adjustable frequency drive, or AFD. An AFD allows the speed of the pump motor to be varied, changing the pump output to suit the cycle demands. This minimizes the amount of wasted energy without affecting other process parameters. This paper will discuss the die casting process and examine the energy savings potential of retrofitting die <b>casting</b> <b>machines</b> with adjustable frequency drives...|$|R

40|$|The {{radiological}} Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) is used {{to analyze}} the radioactive samples collected from different radioactive material processing operations at Savannah River Site (SRS). The expeditious processing of these samples is important for safe and reliable operations at SRS. As the radiological (RAD) ICP-MS machine ages, the experience shows that replacement parts and repairs are difficult to obtain on time for reliable operations after 5 years of service. A discrete event model using commercial software EXTEND was prepared to assess the impact on sample turn around times as the ICP-MS gets older. The model was prepared using the sample statistics from the previous 4 years. Machine utilization rates were calculated for the new <b>machine,</b> 5 year <b>old</b> <b>machine,</b> 10 year <b>old</b> <b>machine,</b> and a 12 year <b>old</b> <b>machine.</b> Computer simulations were run for these periods and the sample delay times calculated. The model was validated against the sample statistics collected from the previous 4 quarters. 90 % confidence intervals were calculated for the 10 th, 25 th, 50 th, and 90 th quantiles of the samples. The simulation results show that if 50 % of the samples are needed on time for efficient site operations, a 10 year <b>old</b> <b>machine</b> could take nearly 50 days longer to process these samples than a 5 -year <b>old</b> <b>machine.</b> This simulation effort quantifies the impact on sample turn around time as the ICP-MS gets older...|$|R

50|$|It is {{here that}} the design of {{continuous}} <b>casting</b> <b>machines</b> may vary. This describes a 'curved apron' casting machine; vertical configurations are also used. In a curved apron <b>casting</b> <b>machine,</b> the strand exits the mold vertically (or on a near vertical curved path) and as it travels through the spray-chamber, the rollers gradually curve the strand towards the horizontal. In a vertical <b>casting</b> <b>machine,</b> the strand stays vertical as it passes through the spray-chamber. Molds in a curved apron <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> can be straight or curved, depending on the basic design of the machine.|$|R

In {{order to}} reduce casting defects and improve casting quality, the author has {{developed}} a three-dimensional parallel vibration <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> based on parallel mechanism. The paper introduces the three-dimensional parallel vibration <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> in structure composition and functional properties, the <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> degree of freedom of excitation mechanism is calculated, its motion performance is analyzed, and the kinematics equations are established. The designed <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> achieves support and excitation functional separation of moving parts which takes complete decoupling of hybrid mechanism 2 PRRR-P (2 R) as excitation mechanism, realizing flask vibration along the X, Y, Z three directions. Test results show that, the <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> can significantly improve casting quality, raise labor productivity, save casting raw materials, and reduce the production costs...|$|R
