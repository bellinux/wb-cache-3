5|$|When she {{had reached}} her Clapham Junction flat, {{she began to}} write immediately. In December, Rowling's mother Anne died after ten years {{suffering}} from multiple sclerosis. Rowling was writing Harry Potter {{at the time and}} had never told her mother about it. Her mother's death heavily affected Rowling's writing, and she channelled her <b>own</b> <b>feelings</b> of loss by writing about Harry's <b>own</b> <b>feelings</b> of loss in greater detail in the first book.|$|E
5|$|Although she {{receives}} a hero's welcome, Katniss is warned by Haymitch {{that she has}} now become a target after defying the Capitol so publicly. Afterward, Peeta is heartbroken when he learns that her actions in the arena were part of a calculated ploy to gain sympathy from the audience. However, Katniss is unsure of her <b>own</b> <b>feelings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Roger Sale {{believes}} Andersen {{expressed his}} feelings {{of social and}} sexual inferiority by creating characters that are inferior to their beloveds. The Little Mermaid, for example, has no soul while her human beloved has a soul as his birthright. In “Thumbelina”, Andersen suggests the toad, the beetle, and the mole are Thumbelina’s inferiors and should remain in their places rather than wanting their superior. Sale indicates they are not inferior to Thumbelina but simply different. He suggests that Andersen may have done some damage to the animal world when he colored his animal characters with his <b>own</b> <b>feelings</b> of inferiority.|$|E

5|$|Wisemore's {{character}} introduces {{feelings about}} the London community and criticises various problems. However, his reflections are portrayed as both correct and lacking, {{and that he is}} focused only on the bad aspects of life. His ideas result from removing himself from society in preference to the company of classical books. Although he does not realise it, the play suggests that there are virtuous people. Merital, in response to Wisemore, believes that Wisemore's philosophical inclinations are foolish. As the play later reveals, Wisemore's views are only a mask to hide from his <b>own</b> <b>feelings</b> and views on love.|$|E
5|$|Christian finds Aaron {{standing}} in the snow outside the airport terminal. Christian confesses his love, and despite his misgivings, Aaron admits his <b>own</b> <b>feelings</b> of love. With all flights canceled due to a snowstorm, Christian and Aaron spend an intimate night in a motel. When Christian awakes, he finds Aaron gone. Aaron's pocket watch, a family heirloom, has been left behind. Christian returns to Los Angeles. In Idaho, Aaron is excommunicated by the church elders, led by his own father, Farron, who is the stake president. Aaron is rejected by his father and scolded by his mother, who tells him {{that he needs to}} pray for forgiveness. When Aaron suggests that he might be gay, his mother slaps him. Overwhelmed by despair, Aaron attempts suicide. He is subsequently sent by his parents to a treatment facility to be cured of his homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|Extramusical {{connotations of}} this kind have {{sometimes}} {{been used as a}} basis {{for the construction of a}} psychological or biographical narrative, attempting to interpret the musical program behind Schubert's last sonatas. Charles Fisk has suggested that the sonatas portray a protagonist going through successive stages of alienation, banishment, exile, and eventual homecoming (in the A major and B-flat Sonatas), or self-assertion (in the C minor Sonata). Discrete tonalities or tonal strata, appearing in complete musical segregation from one another at the beginning of each sonata, suggest contrasting psychological states, such as reality and dream, home and exile, etc.; these conflicts are further deepened in the ensuing slow movements. Once these contrasts are resolved at the finale, by intensive musical integration and the gradual transition from one tonality to the next, a sense of reconciliation, of acceptance and homecoming, is invoked. Fisk's hypothetical narrative is grounded on the basis of the ample cyclic connections within the sonatas and their unique tonal design, as well as their musical similarities to songs such as Der Wanderer and the Winterreise song cycle; and on biographical evidence concerning Schubert's life, including a story written by Schubert (Mein Traum – My Dream). Fisk suggests that the sonatas convey Schubert's <b>own</b> <b>feelings</b> of loneliness and alienation; by their striving towards musical and tonal integration, the writing of these works offered Schubert a release from his emotional distress, particularly deepened after finishing the composition of the lonely, depressive and hopeless songs of Winterreise, during the preceding year.|$|E

25|$|Like Tristan {{the subject}} of Pelléas is a love {{triangle}} set in a vaguely Medieval world. Unlike the protagonists of Tristan, the characters rarely seem to understand or be able to articulate their <b>own</b> <b>feelings.</b> The deliberate vagueness {{of the story is}} paralleled by the elusiveness of Debussy's music.|$|E

25|$|Knowing how to {{suppress}} and manage one's <b>own</b> <b>feelings</b> {{is known as}} emotional intelligence, {{the ability to control}} one's emotions {{and to be able to}} do this at a high level guarantees one's own ability to serve those in need. Emotional intelligence is performed while performing emotional labor, and without one the other can not be there.|$|E
25|$|The {{inability}} {{to relate to}} others {{is also known as}} emotional detachment. Emotional detachment makes it difficult for an individual to empathize with others or to share their <b>own</b> <b>feelings.</b> An emotionally detached person may try to rationalize or apply logic to a situation to which there is no logical explanation. These individuals tend to stress the importance of their independence and may be a bit neurotic. Oftentimes, the {{inability to}} relate to others stems from a traumatic event.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{difficulties}} of the optimistic bias is that people know more about themselves than they do about others. While individuals know how to think about themselves as a single person, they still think of others as a generalized group, which leads to biased estimates and inabilities to sufficiently understand their target or comparison group. Likewise, when making judgments and comparisons about their risk compared to others, people generally ignore the average person, but primarily focus on their <b>own</b> <b>feelings</b> and experiences.|$|E

25|$|Interventions {{in primary}} schools were started during the '80s, {{with the basic}} {{objective}} of empowering children, strengthening their resources, and giving the capacity to discriminate what is right or wrong based upon what is and isn't allowed by law and society. They are also given knowledge of their own rights, told {{that they can have}} their <b>own</b> <b>feelings</b> about themselves, and informed on who to talk to in case they feel uncomfortable about a private matter and wish to talk about it.|$|E
25|$|Bullying: A bully may project his/her <b>own</b> <b>feelings</b> of {{vulnerability}} onto the target(s) of the bullying activity. Despite {{the fact that}} a bully's typically denigrating activities are aimed at the bully's targets, the true source of such negativity is ultimately almost always found in the bully's own sense of personal insecurity and/or vulnerability. Such aggressive projections of displaced negative emotions can occur anywhere from the micro-level of interpersonal relationships, all the way up through to the macro-level of international politics, or even international armed conflict.|$|E
25|$|Lyric poetry, {{in which}} the poet speaks {{of his or her}} <b>own</b> <b>feelings</b> in the first person and expresses a mood, was not {{especially}} common in the Restoration period. Poets expressed their points of view in other forms, usually public or formally disguised poetic forms such as odes, pastoral poetry, and ariel verse. One of the characteristics of the period is its devaluation of individual sentiment and psychology in favour of public utterance and philosophy. The sorts of lyric poetry found later in the Churchyard Poets would, in the Restoration, only exist as pastorals.|$|E
