40|$|The {{growing body}} of {{evidence}} recognizing the adipose tissue (AT) as an active endocrine organ secreting bioactive mediators involved in metabolic and inflammatory disorders, together with the global epidemic of overweight and obesity, rise obesity as a hot topic of current research. The chronic state of low-grade inflammation present in the obese condition and the multiple pleiotropic effects of adipokines on the immune system has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory conditions including rheumatic autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. We will discuss the main relevant evidences on the role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AT</b> <b>on</b> immune and inflammatory networks and the more recent evidences regarding the effects of obesity on the incidence and outcomes of the major autoimmune chronic inflammatory diseases...|$|E
40|$|Background Specific {{immunotherapy}} is {{the only}} curative therapy for type I allergies and the alarming increase in allergy prevalence emphasizes the need for additional/alternative strategies for curative treatment. Allergen toxins (AT), fusion products of an allergen with an apoptosis inducing cytotoxin, are {{a new kind of}} immunotoxin. Objective AT should allow allergen-specific targeting and elimination of allergy-relevant cells, with B cells being the primary target. An important question is the fate of the effector cells, e. g. mast cells and basophils, which carry allergen-specific IgE: the immunotoxin might even prove to be harmful. Methods We established a reliable in vitro B cell model (using two mouse hybridoma cell lines) for testing specificity and toxicity of P 5 -ETA', a fusion protein of the major timothy grass pollen allergen Phl p 5 b and truncated Pseudomonas Exotoxin A. In a second step, we investigated the impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AT</b> <b>on</b> human basophils. Results P 5 -ETA' reliably eliminated Phl p 5 -specific cells in the in vitro B cell model, leaving unspecific B cells unharmed. Human basophils of grass pollen allergic donors specifically bound P 5 -ETA', released IL- 4 and up-regulated the activation marker CD 203 c, but were not subject to the toxic effect because of lack of internalization of IgE-bound allergen. Conclusion According to our data, basophils are pure effector cells in the context of IgE-bound allergen and not involved in classical antigen presentation...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of sodium channel blockade on anisotropic excitation propagation in the intact canine left ventricle. Background. Anisotropic ventricular conduction—electric conductivity dependent on the myocardial fiber direction—is one of the important mechanisms of ventricular arrhythmia. However, the effects of sodium channel blockade, especially the differential effect of a subclass of this agent, on the anisotropic properties remain unknown. Methods. In 28 anesthetized, open chest dogs, a small cannula was inserted into the left anterior descending coronary artery. Saline (control), disopyramide, lidocaine or flecainide was infused selectively into the cannula. An array of 64 epicardial electrodes was placed on the anterior surface of the ventricle. Activation time (AT) was measured along the longitudinal (L) and transverse (T) directions. Results. High dose flecainide (100 μg/kg body weight per min) delayed the AT along the L direction markedly (mean [±SE] 227 ± 38 %, p < 0. 02) and mildly (121 ± 10 %, p < 0. 02) along the T direction in regular beats (p < 0. 007, L vs. T). Lidocaine and disopyramide did not show direction-dependent prolongation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AT</b> <b>on</b> regular beats. When examined on premature beats, AT was delayed, depending on the coupling interval and the fiber direction when saline, flecainide or lidocaine was infused. The conduction blocks along the L direction were observed in three of seven dogs on regular beats after flecainide and ventricular fibrillation ensued in two of these three dogs. Conclusions. A peculiar slowing of L conduction by flecainide may relate to the character of proarrhythmia. (J Am Coll Cardiol 1997; 29 : 1639 – 44...|$|E
