5|$|Among Hindus, Shashthi {{is widely}} {{regarded}} the benefactor and protector of children and tutelary deity of every household. She is also worshipped as a bestower of children to the childless, and regarded as the foremost goddess for blessing children. One of the earliest scriptural sources to describe a ritual in her honour is the second century BCE composition Manava Grhya Sutra, appended to the Yajurveda (written between the 14th and 10th centuries BCE), which describes a ritual called Shashthi-kalpa. In the Shashthi-kalpa rite, which was described as performed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> lunar day of every fortnight, Shashthi was invoked to provide sons, cattle, treasures, corn, and the fulfilment of wishes. Today, Shashthi continues to be worshipped <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> day {{of each of the}} twelve lunar months of the Hindu calendar, as well as <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> day after childbirth in the lying-in chamber where the birth has taken place. Shashthi is worshipped in a different form in each of these lunar months as the deities Chandan, Aranya, Kardama, Lunthana, Chapeti, Durga, Nadi, Mulaka, Anna, Sitala, Gorupini or Ashoka.|$|E
5|$|Euler was {{featured}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> {{series of the}} Swiss 10-franc banknote and on numerous Swiss, German, and Russian postage stamps. The asteroid 2002 Euler was named in his honor. He is also commemorated by the Lutheran Church on their Calendar of Saints on 24 May—he was a devout Christian (and believer in biblical inerrancy) who wrote apologetics and argued forcefully against the prominent atheists of his time.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Shashthi came to {{represent}} all goddesses and forces responsible for causing diseases {{in children and}} their mothers, who needed to be propitiated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> day after childbirth to prevent these illnesses. Consequently, Shashthi came to personify the sixth day of a child's life. The sixth day of the lunar fortnight is itself called Shashti, a name derived from {{the name of the}} goddess. The Yajnavalkya Smriti, composed during Gupta rule between the 3rd and 5th centuries CE, describes the rites of Shashthi Puja in which Shashthi is worshipped <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> day after childbirth to ensure the protection of the newborn baby. According to one explanation for the worship of Shashthi on this day, folk belief associates this critical time in an infant's life with great susceptibility to diseases related to childbirth, such as puerperal fever and tetanus, and that worship of Shashthi is performed to help ward off these diseases.|$|E

5|$|Over time, the {{characterisation}} of Shashthi {{underwent a}} gradual evolution. Aforementioned folk traditions originating between the 10th and 5th centuries BCE associated the goddess with {{both positive and}} negative elements of fertility, birth, motherhood and childhood. However, between the 4th century BCE and the 5th century CE, a shift occurred in which Shashthi was increasingly depicted as a malevolent deity associated with the sufferings of mothers and children. The fifth century text Kashyapa Samhita calls Shashthi by the epithet Jataharini ("one who steals the born") and provides a list of the malevolent activities in which Shashthi is believed to engage, including her practice of stealing foetuses from the womb and devouring children <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> day following birth. For this reason, the text recommends that she be propitiated through worship in her honour on this day in the lying-in room and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> day of every fortnight thereafter.|$|E

He was the son of the king of Macedon, Philip II, and his fourth wife, Olympias, the daughter of Neoptolemus I, king of Epirus. Although Philip had seven or eight wives, Olympias was his principal wife for some time, likely because she gave birth to Alexander.|$|E

5|$|In North India, Shashthi is worshipped at {{childbirth}} and puberty, {{and during}} marriage rites. When the pregnant woman is isolated during childbirth in the lying-in chamber, a cow-dung {{figure of the}} goddess is traditionally kept in the room. The birth of a living child is considered the blessing of Shashthi, while {{the birth of a}} stillborn infant or the early death of a child are considered manifestations of her wrath. Before childbirth, Shashthi is worshipped to protect the welfare of the expecting mother. She is also invoked after childbirth <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> day of each month until the child reaches puberty, especially when the child is sick.|$|E

5|$|Most {{scholars}} {{believe that}} Shashthi's roots {{can be traced}} to Hindu folk traditions. References to this goddess appear in Hindu scriptures as early as 8th and 9th century BCE, in which she is associated with children as well as the Hindu war-god Skanda. Early references consider her a foster-mother of Skanda, but in later texts she is identified with Skanda's consort, Devasena. In some early texts where Shashthi appears as an attendant of Skanda, she is said to cause diseases in the mother and child, and thus needed to be propitiated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> day after childbirth. However, over time, this malignant goddess became seen as the benevolent saviour and bestower of children.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species of}} malacostracans have {{distinct}} sexes (a {{phenomenon known as}} gonochorism), although a few species exhibit hermaphroditism. The female genital openings or gonopores are located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> thoracic segment or its appendages, while the male gonopores are on the eighth segment or its appendages, or in {{a small number of}} species, on the seventh. The naupliar larval stages are often reduced and take place before hatching, but where they occur, a metamorphosis usually occurs between the larval and the adult forms. Primitive malacostracans have a free-swimming naupliar larval stage.|$|E
