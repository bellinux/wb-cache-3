5|$|From the 1987 Momentary Lapse of Reason tour onwards, Wright and touring keyboardist Jon Carin favoured Kurzweil digital synthesizers, {{including}} the K2000 keyboard and K2000S rack module for reproducing piano and electric piano sounds. Wright retained the Hammond {{along with a}} Leslie speaker, playing it <b>onstage</b> <b>and</b> using it during the Division Bell sessions.|$|E

5|$|The {{story begins}} with Aya Brea, an NYPD rookie, {{attending}} an opera at Carnegie Hall with {{a blind date}} in New York City on Christmas Eve 1997. During the opera, everyone in the building spontaneously combusts, except for Aya, and an actress on stage named Melissa Pearce. Aya confronts Melissa <b>onstage,</b> <b>and</b> Melissa says that Aya’s mitochondria need more time to develop. She flees backstage, with Aya giving chase. Backstage, Melissa then mutates into a beast and flees into the sewers, declaring that her name is now Eve.|$|E

5|$|This video, {{which was}} {{directed}} by Diane Martel, features Beyoncé walking through a performance hall in modern-day street clothes, performing the song. Once she arrives <b>onstage</b> <b>and</b> at the song's bridge, she appears in costume as Deena, dressed in a 1970s-era gown. Intercut into the video are scenes from Dreamgirls, most of which depict Deena's relationship with Curtis. These clips, however, were taken out in the director's cut version of the video; this version appeared on the B'Day Anthology Video Album. In her first outfit, Beyoncé is seen wearing a Wonder Woman T-shirt.|$|E
5|$|In August 1979, {{after two}} warm-up shows in Copenhagen, Led Zeppelin headlined two concerts at the Knebworth Music Festival, playing {{to a crowd}} of {{approximately}} 104,000 on the first night. A brief, low-key European tour was undertaken in June and July 1980, featuring a stripped-down set without the usual lengthy jams and solos. On 27 June, at a show in Nuremberg, Germany, the concert {{came to an abrupt}} halt {{in the middle of the}} third song, when Bonham collapsed <b>onstage</b> <b>and</b> was rushed to hospital. Speculation in the press suggested that his collapse had been the result of excessive alcohol and drug use, but the band claimed that he had simply overeaten.|$|E
5|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Andy Saunders at the Bournemouth International Centre in January 2012, as part of One Direction's Up All Night Tour (2011–12). On 9 May 2012, Sony Music Australia disclosed via social networking website Twitter that a video for the track would premiere on 11 May. A 30-second preview of the clip, which showed the group gather around a couch <b>onstage</b> <b>and</b> sing the piece, premiered on Entertainment Tonight on 9 May.

5|$|Ciocia {{writes that}} {{with half the}} novel taking place in {{theatrical}} settings, Nan may be playing a role as character in her own life or a play on a stage set in a theatre or the streets of London. She starts as a spectator watching Kitty <b>onstage,</b> <b>and</b> later with Kitty, watching how men move and behave to improve their act. She becomes a performer, with Kitty, as a renter and again for the predatory Diana and her friends. Finally she takes the role of director as she assists and impels Ralph to perform his speech. At this point, {{she is able to}} reconcile her identity and the story ends. Waters consciously chose to create a complicated plot, and was impressed with Iris Murdoch's claim that she herself had entire stories worked out well in advance of writing them, a method Waters used with Tipping the Velvet.|$|E
5|$|The two {{discussed}} {{the matter at}} a meeting in early 1952 in Palm Beach, Florida, where Rodgers was vacationing as he worked on melodic sketches for the television documentary Victory at Sea. Rodgers suggested dispensing with the overture, reserving that for the overture of the show-within-the-show. Following another meeting in mid-1952, they called in long-time Rodgers and Hammerstein stage designer Jo Mielziner and hired him to design the sets. Mielziner confirmed that a scene could be played part <b>onstage</b> <b>and</b> part in the backstage world, but that this would be expensive. In August 1952, Hammerstein began a sketch of the plot; by early October he had a near-complete first draft. As the show was to be musical comedy, the pair hired one of the top musical comedy directors, George Abbott, who accepted the position without reading the script. He regretted the haste of this decision as soon as he read the script, finding it sentimental and melodramatic. He confided his concerns to the pair; in response, Hammerstein told him to make whatever changes in the script he thought best. With Hammerstein's permission, Abbott made major changes to the plot.|$|E

25|$|Single-sex {{theatrical}} troupes {{often have}} some performers who cross-dress to play roles written {{for members of}} the opposite sex (travesti). Cross-dressing, particularly the depiction of males wearing dresses, is often used for comic effect <b>onstage</b> <b>and</b> on-screen.|$|E
25|$|The band's set {{lists for}} live shows were often loose, {{featuring}} improvisational jams and rough performances of unreleased songs.

25|$|Drummers often set {{up their}} own drum {{hardware}} <b>onstage</b> <b>and</b> adjust to their own comfort level. Major touring bands on tour will often have a drum tech who knows how to set up the drummer's hardware and instruments in the desired location and layout.|$|E

He subsequently collapsed after a drug overdose and was rushed to hospital. He would eventually recover and return to recording with The Kinks.|$|E
25|$|By 1920, Eltinge {{was very}} wealthy and {{was living in}} one of the most lavish mansions in Southern California, Villa Capistrano.

After filming, Eltinge continued touring <b>onstage</b> <b>and</b> would do so until 1927. He also made two films, Madame Behave and The Fascinating Widow, in 1925.|$|E
50|$|For convenience, some mixing {{consoles}} include inserts or a {{patch bay}} or patch panel. Patch bays are mainly used for recording mixers. However, live sound mixers may also include patch bays. In live sound, the cables from the <b>onstage</b> microphones <b>and</b> instrument outputs are not typically plugged {{directly into the}} mixer, because this would require {{a large number of}} cables to go from the stage the mixer. Instead, the <b>onstage</b> mic <b>and</b> instrument cables are typically plugged into the patch bay of a thick snake cable, which runs from the stage to the mixer. The outputs from the snake's second patch bay (near the mixer) are then plugged into the mixer.|$|R

The festival featured concert performances and wrestling hosted by Juggalo Championship Wrestling While performing on the final night, Insane Clown Posse asked the Juggalos to join them <b>onstage,</b> <b>and</b> about 300 fans rushed onto the stage. After performing for almost 30 more minutes, the concert was abruptly stopped by the venue's management.|$|E
25|$|In the 2008/2009 season, DiDonato {{returned}} to Covent Garden as Donna Elvira in Mozart's Don Giovanni and as Rosina in Il barbiere di Siviglia. In {{a performance of}} that opera on July 7, DiDonato slipped <b>onstage</b> <b>and</b> broke her right fibula; she finished the first act hobbling {{and the rest of}} the performance on crutches. She then performed the five remaining scheduled performances from a wheelchair. She performed the roles of Beatrice in Berlioz's Béatrice et Bénédict with Houston Grand Opera, Idamante in Mozart's Idomeneo with Opéra National de Paris, and Rosina in Il barbiere di Siviglia in her debut with Vienna State Opera.|$|E
25|$|In the past, {{band members}} dressed in outlandish makeup and costumes, {{and engaged in}} {{intentionally}} shocking behavior both <b>onstage</b> <b>and</b> off. Their lyrics often received criticism for their anti-religious sentiment and references to sex, violence and drugs, while their live performances were frequently called offensive and obscene. On several occasions, protests and petitions led to the group being blocked from performing, with at least three US states passing legislation banning the group from performing at state-owned venues. They released a number of platinum-selling albums, including Antichrist Superstar (1996) and Mechanical Animals (1998). These albums, along with their highly-stylized music videos and worldwide touring, brought public recognition to Marilyn Manson. In 1999, news media falsely blamed the band for influencing the perpetrators of the Columbine massacre.|$|E
