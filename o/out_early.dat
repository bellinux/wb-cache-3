5|$|A prophecy {{says that}} Troy will not fall if Troilus lives into adulthood. So the goddess Athena {{encourages}} the Greek warrior Achilles to seek him <b>out</b> <b>early</b> in the Trojan War. The youth {{is known to}} take great delight in his horses. Achilles ambushes him and his sister Polyxena when he has ridden with her for water from a well in the Thymbra – an area outside Troy {{where there is a}} temple of Apollo.|$|E

5|$|Ice had to {{be stored}} at {{multiple}} points between harvesting and its final use by a customer. One method for doing this was the construction of ice houses to hold the product, typically either shortly after the ice was first harvested or at regional depots after it had been shipped <b>out.</b> <b>Early</b> ice houses were relatively small, but later storage facilities were the size of large warehouses and contained much larger quantities of ice.|$|E

5|$|In the First Test at Trent Bridge, Hassett {{came in on}} {{the second}} day with Australia at 4/185 in reply to England's 165. Australia had been scoring slowly due to England's use of leg theory. Hassett almost holed <b>out</b> <b>early</b> when he edged a ball just wide of the wicket-keeper. Hassett and Bradman were heckled for their slow batting but they {{remained}} unhurried in the face of England's stifling tactics Australia had plenty of time after bowling out their opponents easily. Hassett had a period of 20 minutes without scoring.|$|E
5|$|Madison's {{political}} experience before becoming governor {{consisted of a}} twenty-year tenure as state auditor. Although his military service made him extremely popular in Kentucky, he sought no higher office until the citizens insisted he run for governor in 1816. James Johnson, his only challenger in the race, dropped <b>out</b> <b>early</b> due to Madison's overwhelming popularity, and Madison was elected without opposition. A few weeks later, {{he became the first}} Kentucky governor to die in office. Opponents of his lieutenant governor, Gabriel Slaughter, mounted a popular but unsuccessful challenge to Slaughter's succeeding Madison in office.|$|E

5|$|About 10:30, the Germans {{reached the}} {{defensive}} line near Torčec, and fighting began. A few Breguet 19s of the 4th Air Reconnaissance Group attached to the 1st Army Group which had survived an early morning raid on their airfield the previous day, mounted attacks on the bridge over the Drava at Zákány. After the Germans reinforced their bridgehead with two more battalions, they overcame the Yugoslav defenders, who had suffered significant losses and were running low on artillery ammunition. About 18:00, the 53rd Infantry Regiment withdrew to Koprivnica along with its artillery support, and remained in the town during the night. The bridge at Zákány was destroyed later that day by sabotage units. At 23:00, following orders from Petrović {{that he was to}} attack on 8 April at all costs, Nedeljković issued orders for a counterattack to be carried <b>out</b> <b>early</b> on 8 April.|$|E

5|$|After lunch, Hutton rocked {{onto the}} front foot, played outside a Johnson off break and was bowled for 20 to leave England at 2/32. The English opener had been {{uncertain}} against Johnson's spin and played forward too early at a slower ball, which went between a gap between his bat and pad. Later in the afternoon, Denis Compton and captain Norman Yardley played Johnson cautiously but safely; in particular, Yardley repeatedly driving a series of overpitched balls from Johnson for runs. Johnson took the last two wickets to fall on the second day, having Alec Coxon caught and bowled for 19 and Laker caught behind for 28 after the pair had put on 41. England were <b>out</b> <b>early</b> on the third morning for 215. Johnson ended with 3/72, having sent down 35 overs, the most by any Australian.|$|E

5|$|By September15, shelters {{were opened}} {{throughout}} Tinian and Saipan at local schools, most schools and all governmental buildings {{were closed and}} residents rushed to board up their homes. The American Red Cross had also mobilized on the islands by this time. Some private schools were open during the morning but let <b>out</b> <b>early</b> to allow students {{to return to their}} families before the typhoon's arrival. On Saipan, 179 residents sought refuge in shelters by the afternoon of September15, by which time heavy rain had begun falling. Only one flight was delayed by the typhoon across all the islands. The youth basketball league in the Northern Mariana Islands canceled their games for the time Choi-wan passed through the islands. At the height of the storm, a total of 270 residents sought refuge in shelters on Saipan.|$|E
5|$|Despite his struggles, Affeldt {{was named}} to the Giants' playoff roster. Affeldt made his first playoff {{appearance}} for the Giants in Game 2 of the 2010 NLCS against Philadelphia. He struck out one batter and intentionally walked another one, but Santiago Casilla allowed him to score as the Giants lost 61. Affeldt faced (and retired) one batter in Game 5, but the Phillies won that game 42. In Game 6, Affeldt entered the game in the third inning with runners on first and second and nobody out after starting pitcher Jonathan Sánchez was taken <b>out</b> <b>early.</b> He pitched two hitless, scoreless innings, and the Giants won the game 32 to advance to the World Series. Affeldt pitched in two games in the World Series, which the Giants won in five games to give Affeldt his first World Series ring.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{it became}} {{increasingly}} apparent to U.S. planners that, {{in a military}} confrontation with Warsaw Pact forces, NATO aircraft would quickly suffer heavy losses. This came {{as a result of}} sophisticated Soviet defense networks, which used surveillance radars and radar-guided surface-to-air missiles (SAM) and anti-aircraft artillery to seek and eliminate enemy aircraft. Consequently, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) started a study on low-observability aircraft, seeking to design and produce an operational stealth aircraft. Five companies were initially invited, three of which bowed <b>out</b> <b>early.</b> The remaining two were later joined by Lockheed.|$|E

5|$|It was Hamilton's {{teammate}} {{and defending}} race winner Rosberg who topped the time sheets {{at the second}} session on Friday afternoon, setting a 1:12.385 lap time. He led Hamilton by almost half a second, with the two Ferrari cars of Vettel and Räikkönen about a second adrift. Slight rain saw most drivers head <b>out</b> <b>early,</b> but the conditions never became wet enough to require intermediate tyres. After starting on the medium compound tyres, many drivers switched to the softer compound for race simulations, only for the session to be red flagged shortly after when Fernando Alonso spun at turn four, only to pull over {{at the side of}} the road with smoke coming from his car some corners later. Valtteri Bottas was sixth fastest, behind Daniel Ricciardo, suffering a spin at turn nine.|$|E
5|$|Opposition {{parties and}} three {{coalition}} partners of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led central government demanded {{the dismissal of}} Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi for failing to contain the violence, with some calling {{for the removal of}} Union Home Minister L.

The Indian Election Commission ruled <b>out</b> <b>early</b> elections, citing the prevailing law and order situation, a decision the union government unsuccessfully appealed against in the Supreme Court. Elections were held in December and Modi returned to power.|$|E
5|$|Prague-born Wilhelm Steinitz {{beginning}} in 1873 described {{how to avoid}} weaknesses in one's own position and how to create and exploit such weaknesses in the opponent's position. The scientific approach and positional understanding of Steinitz revolutionized the game. Steinitz {{was the first to}} break a position down into its components. Before Steinitz, players brought their queen <b>out</b> <b>early,</b> did not completely develop their other pieces, and mounted a quick attack on the opposing king, which either succeeded or failed. The level of defense was poor and players did not form any deep plan. In addition to his theoretical achievements, Steinitz founded an important tradition: his triumph over the leading German master Johannes Zukertort in 1886 is regarded as the first official World Chess Championship. Steinitz lost his crown in 1894 to a much younger player, the German mathematician Emanuel Lasker, who maintained this title for 27years, the longest tenure of all World Champions.|$|E

5|$|Four Black Arrows were {{launched}} between 1969 and 1971. The first two launches were demonstration flights, with battleship third stages and a boilerplate payload. On {{the first flight}} an electrical fault caused a pair of first stage combustion chambers to pivot back and forth. Before it cleared the launch pad, the rocket was rolling erratically, and about a minute later it began to disintegrate. After the first stage engine failed, and the rocket began to fall back to earth, it was destroyed by range safety. The second launch was successful. The first all-up launch on 2 September 1970 was the third launch of the Black Arrow, and Britain's first attempt to launch a satellite. The launch failed due to a leak in the second stage oxidiser pressurisation system, which caused it to cut <b>out</b> <b>early.</b> The third stage fired, but the rocket did not reach orbit, and re-entered over the Gulf of Carpentaria. The fourth launch successfully orbited the Prospero satellite, making the United Kingdom the sixth nation to place a satellite into orbit {{by means of an}} indigenously developed carrier rocket. The satellite, also known as X-3, was named Prospero after the character Prospero in Shakespeare's The Tempest. The name was chosen as a reference to events in the play, in which Prospero, a sorcerer, gives up his powers. Prior to the cancellation of the Black Arrow programme, the satellite was to be named after Puck from A Midsummer Night's Dream.|$|E
5|$|MD7 {{is the old}} {{alignment}} of US40 in northeastern Maryland. The route was first laid <b>out</b> <b>early</b> in colonial times and later formed part of the post road between Baltimore and Philadelphia and between {{the northern and southern}} colonies. The highway in Baltimore and Harford counties became a turnpike in the 19th century. The Maryland State Roads Commission marked portions of {{what became known as the}} Philadelphia Road close to Baltimore and between Perryville and Elkton for improvement as state roads in 1909. Those sections and the highway between Aberdeen and Havre de Grace were constructed as modern roads in the early to mid-1910s. The remainder of the highway was constructed in the 1920s and designated US40 in 1927. The high volume of traffic and the required continuous expansion of the highway led the Maryland State Roads Commission to construct the modern Pulaski Highway between 1935 and 1941. Old sections of US40 became segments of MD7 between 1938 and 1941 as portions of the new four-lane divided highway opened from Baltimore to Elkton.|$|E
5|$|The Indians had a doubleheader {{against the}} White Sox on Sunday, July 6, for which 31,566 were in attendance; it was {{estimated}} that approximately 30 percent of the crowd were black. Some congregations of black churches let <b>out</b> <b>early</b> while others walked immediately from Sunday service to Comiskey Park. Boudreau had Doby pinch-hit in the first game but for the second, listed him a starter at first base, a position Doby was not expected to fill when the Indians brought him up to play at second base. Doby had played the position before with the Eagles but was without a proper mitt for first base and met much resistance when attempts were made to borrow one from teammates, including first baseman Eddie Robinson, for whom Boudreau had asked Doby to replace that day. Doby said only because Gordon asked in the clubhouse to borrow one of the first baseman's mitts did he have one to use in the second game of the doubleheader as earlier direct requests from Doby were rejected. The mitt was loaned by a White Sox player. Boudreau recounts an incident where Robinson refused the mitt to Doby, but when asked by Indians traveling secretary Spud Goldstein, Robinson obliged. It was the only game Doby started {{for the remainder of the}} season. Doby recorded his first major league hit in four at-bats and had an RBI in a 5–1 Indians win.|$|E
