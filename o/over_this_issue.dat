5|$|While {{critical}} of the strike, the public did not necessarily support the cause of equal employment opportunities for black workers. A public opinion poll conducted in Philadelphia during the strike showed that only a slim majority of the city's population felt that blacks should be hired as motormen and conductors, but that a significant majority opposed having a strike <b>over</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|E
5|$|On May 25, 2001, {{the print}} edition {{announced}} {{the sale of}} the Washington Blade to Window Media, LLC, a group of gay publications. With the new ownership came several changes to standardize the paper with other Window Media publications, such as the return of editorials to the publication after being missing for several decades. Shortly after {{the sale of the}} paper, staff at the Blade sought a vote to unionize {{with the help of the}} Washington-Baltimore Newspaper Guild. The Guild and the staff of the Blade brought a complaint to the National Labor Relations Board and deliberated for a few weeks <b>over</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> resulting in a ten to eight vote against unionization on July 20, 2001.|$|E
5|$|Wheelwright {{arrived in}} Boston in the Massachusetts Bay Colony on 26 May 1636, and was {{admitted}} to the Boston church on 12 June 1636, with his wife, Mary, and her mother, Susanna Hutchinson. During the year of his arrival, several of the Puritan ministers of Massachusetts had taken notice of the religious gatherings that his relative by marriage, Anne Hutchinson, had been holding at her house, and they also began having questions about the preaching of John Cotton whose Boston parishioners seemed to them to be harboring some theologically unsound opinions. Wheelwright was a strong advocate of Cotton's theology, as was Hutchinson, but their views differed from those {{of the majority of the}} colony's ministers, and they soon became embroiled in a major clash <b>over</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|E
25|$|Alexander, {{who also}} valued Craterus highly as a most {{competent}} officer, {{was forced to}} intervene and had stern words for both. It {{is a measure of}} how high feelings were running <b>over</b> <b>this</b> contentious <b>issue</b> that such a thing should have happened and also an indication of how closely Hephaestion identified Alexander's wishes with his own.|$|R
5000|$|It put {{the rights}} of the Sami as an {{indigenous}} people with distinct rights over the lands in Northern Norway, onto the national political agenda. This process reached a key milestone in 2005, when the Finnmark Act was passed. It is considered that though the Sami lost the battle <b>over</b> <b>this</b> particular <b>issue,</b> they made important long-term gains.|$|R
50|$|<b>Over</b> time, <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> was {{eliminated}} by switch billing instead of billing at the SMSC and by new features within SMSCs to allow blocking of foreign mobile users sending messages through it. By {{the end of}} 2000, {{the average number of}} messages reached 35 per user per month, and on Christmas Day 2006, over 205 million messages were sent in the UK alone.|$|R
5|$|The first {{indication}} of the franchises' displeasure with their parent <b>over</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> came in 2005 and involved claims by a Manhattan-based franchise that the company failed {{to take into account}} local market conditions when setting prices. E-Z Eating Corp., operator of five restaurants in New York and owned by brother-sister partners Elizabeth and Luan Sadik, had been struggling after the 9/11 terrorist attacks but had been in a company-sponsored turn around program when Burger King started its new value program in 2006. The program required all locations to carry a specific set of products at a discounted price, with limited exemptions for certain locations that met a set of criteria. The Sadiks applied for an exemption to the pricing requirement but were turned down by Burger King. In response to the denial, the Sadiks closed two of their locations without consulting Burger King and refused to implement the scheme in their other two locations. Burger King responded by suing the company in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida for breach of contract, and eventually revoked the franchise agreement for the remaining two locations in January 2006. The Sadik's responded by filing their own lawsuit in 2008 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York claiming that Burger King had engaged in a breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair in its actions towards the franchise. The actions were eventually consolidated in a single case in the Southern District Court under Judge Maricia G. Cooke, where Burger King requested and was granted a summary judgement against the Sadiks. The judgment was upheld on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in June 2009.|$|E
25|$|Whether Lewis then {{intended}} {{to split the}} AFL <b>over</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> is debatable; at the outset, the CIO presented itself as only a group of unions within the AFL gathered to support industrial unionism, rather than a group opposed to the AFL itself.|$|E
25|$|President Abraham Lincoln {{and his top}} advisors did {{not want}} to risk war with Britain <b>over</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue.</b> After several tense weeks, the crisis was {{resolved}} when the Lincoln administration released the envoys and disavowed Captain Wilkes's actions without a formal apology. Mason and Slidell resumed their voyage to Britain but failed in their goal of achieving diplomatic recognition.|$|E
50|$|The 2004 {{examination}} of the New Zealand Scholarship by the New Zealand Qualifications Authority was marred by controversy, most notably the irregular pass rates (e.g. 0.9% pass rate for Biology 2004).

5000|$|The Roman Senate, {{appalled by}} the {{massacre}} of the Ligurians, had ordered the consul Tiberius Sempronius Longus, who was stationed in Sicily, to reinforce the existing Roman general, Publius Cornelius Scipio. Unknown to them now, Scipio had been wounded during the Battle of Ticinus and had been driven into the hills south of Piacenza, then Placentia, a contemporary colony of the Romans (The Gauls had turned against Rome now in favor of Hannibal <b>over</b> <b>this</b> very <b>issue</b> of colonization) ...|$|R

25|$|A {{struggle}} for power between Arafat and Abbas ensued. Abbas's term as prime minister was characterised by numerous conflicts between him and Arafat over the distribution of power. The United States and Israel accused Arafat of undermining Abbas and his government. Abbas hinted he would resign if not given {{more control over the}} administration. In early September 2003, he confronted the Palestinian parliament <b>over</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{territorial}} dispute {{is a major}} source of nationalistic tensions. Since the South Korean government bases its legitimacy partly on the notion that it defends South Korea from North Korea in the North and from Japan from the south, nationalism has been stoked <b>over</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue.</b> Korean tourists visit the remote, inhospitable island, in order to show national solidarity. In Japan, maps mark the islands as being Japanese territory.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the advent}} of modern cosmology, there was {{considerable}} talk about {{the size and shape}} of the universe. In 1920, the famous Shapley-Curtis debate took place between Harlow Shapley and Heber D. Curtis <b>over</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue.</b> Shapley argued for a small universe the size of the Milky Way galaxy and Curtis argued that the Universe was much larger. The issue was resolved in the coming decade with Hubble's improved observations.|$|E
50|$|Later in the 1980s, Garaikoetxea, {{the ruling}} lehendakari, {{struggled}} for autonomy from the party. Arzalluz, however, asserted {{the authority of}} the organization <b>over</b> individual members. <b>This</b> <b>issue,</b> among others, led in 1984 to a schism within the PNV, and {{to the creation of a}} new party Eusko Alkartasuna, led by Garaikoetxea.|$|R
50|$|The Independence/Progressive {{coalition}} {{lost its}} {{majority in the}} Icelandic parliamentary election, 2016. After several failed attempts to form a government from alternative combinations, a new coalition was formed in January 2017, led by the Independence party and joined by Regeneration and Bright Future, both of whom support EU membership and the former of whom was originally a splinter movement that left the Independence party <b>over</b> <b>this</b> very <b>issue.</b> The coalition deal included a pledge to hold a parliamentary vote on whether to hold an EU membership referendum.|$|R
50|$|Johnson did run for governor, {{being elected}} in 1824. He served a full term as Louisiana Governor from 1824 until 1828. During his term, the {{legislature}} moved the state {{seat of government}} to Donaldsonville, a compromise location settled on between Anglo-American leaders, who wanted the capital moved from New Orleans to a more northerly location, and French Creoles, who wanted to retain the seat of government within an historically-French area to reflect the state's origins. Earlier in 1824, riots in New Orleans <b>over</b> <b>this</b> same <b>issue</b> had forced the resignation of Governor Thomas B. Robertson.|$|R
25|$|The bewildering {{number and}} variety of phonetic values that signs could have in Sumerian led to an unfortunate detour in {{understanding}} the language – a Paris-based orientalist, Joseph Halévy, argued from 1874 onward that Sumerian was not a natural language, but rather a secret code (a cryptolect), and {{for over a decade}} the leading Assyriologists battled <b>over</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue.</b> For a dozen years, starting in 1885, even the great Friedrich Delitzsch accepted Halévy's arguments, not renouncing Halévy until 1897.|$|E
25|$|James also {{advocated}} the West Indies Federation. It was <b>over</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> that he fell {{out with the}} PNM leadership. He returned to Great Britain, where he joined Calvin Hernton, Obi Egbuna {{and others on the}} faculty of the Antiuniversity of London, which had been set up by a group of left-wing thinkers led by American academic Joseph Berke. In 1968 James was invited to the USA, where he taught at the University of the District of Columbia.|$|E
25|$|Some MP, MLAs of Patnaik's party BJD {{have been}} accused of {{involvement}} in chit fund scam and questioned by the CBI in 2014. CBI is investigating over 30 companies in relation to these multi-crore financial scams, which have robbed lakhs of the state's poor of their lifetime savings. Questions were raised because of Patnaik's silence <b>over</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> and his proximity to many such businesses, as he was photographed at the launch of a news channel by one such company.|$|E

25|$|The 1999 Kosovo War {{divided the}} party internally. The {{parliamentary}} {{party in the}} House of Representatives supported the NATO intervention, while the Senate parliamentary party was against the intervention. Several former PSP members within the House of Representatives parliamentary party began to openly speak out their doubts about the intervention. A compromise was found: GreenLeft would support the intervention {{as long as it}} limited itself to military targets. Prominent members of the founding parties including Marcus Bakker en Joop Vogt left the party <b>over</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|E
25|$|The anger {{generated}} by this controversy affects JTS to this day. The sensitivity <b>over</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> caused future JTS Chancellors Ismar Schorsch, and then Arnold Eisen {{to avoid making}} future halakhic decisions, and insisting that such issues be resolved by the CJLS, e.g. the issue of homosexuality. This was especially apparent as Schorsch was a strong proponent of not changing the movement's views on homosexuality, while Eisen was a proponent of making such changes. Despite their personal views, each felt it would be improper to overrule the CJLS.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} of Pakistan was under extreme {{pressure from the}} United States to release Davis. News reports indicate that the Pakistani Embassy in Washington was cut off from all communications with the United States Department of State <b>over</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue.</b> Diplomatic notes were sent by the U.S. Government to Pakistan's Foreign Office urging it to grant diplomatic immunity to Davis. A delegation of the United States House Committee on Armed Services conveyed a veiled threat that Pakistan–US defense cooperation could be under cloud if the standoff persisted {{on the issue of}} immunity for Davis.|$|E
5000|$|Constantine's {{derogatory}} epithet Kopronymos ("Dung-named", from kopros ("feces" [...] or [...] "animal dung") and onoma, [...] "name"), {{was applied}} {{to him by his}} avowed enemies <b>over</b> <b>this</b> extremely emotional <b>issue,</b> the iconodules.

25|$|The four plaintiffs {{also went}} to court <b>over</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> in France. Up to 1964, the French {{legislation}} treated both French authors and foreign authors exactly the same; works of both were granted exactly the same copyright protection. In a lawsuit that was ultimately decided by the French Court of Cassation in 1959, the plaintiffs won: {{the court ruled that}} works of foreign authors were entitled to copyright in France, and that the works of these four Soviet composers were thus copyrighted in France. It found their moral rights violated and ordered the film to be confiscated.|$|E
25|$|Both in Brazil {{and in the}} United States—the {{countries}} with the two largest slave populations in the Western Hemisphere—the end of slavery found the regions in which slaves had been concentrated poorer than other regions of these same countries. For the United States, a case could be made that {{this was due to}} the Civil War, which did so much damage to the South, but no such explanation would apply to Brazil, which fought no Civil War <b>over</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue.</b> Moreover, even in the United States, the South lagged behind the North in many ways even before the Civil War.|$|E
5000|$|At Lausanne Rıza {{was sent}} as {{assistant}} {{to the head of}} the Turkish delegation İsmet İnönü. It was he who proposed the motions recognising the Grand National Assembly as the legitimate government of Turkey, the end of the monarchy but the continuing control of the Caliphate by the Turkish government. However whilst at Lausanne he also came to blows with the former Prime Minister of Greece Eleftherios Venizelos over the issue of the Pontic Greeks. Indeed what the Allies saw as Rıza's intransigence <b>over</b> both <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> and that of the Armenians led to a Yugoslavian delegate claiming that Rıza was [...] "beginning to show the cloven hoof".|$|R
