5|$|The {{perception}} <b>of</b> <b>sharks</b> {{as dangerous}} animals has been popularized by publicity {{given to a}} few isolated unprovoked attacks, such as the Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916, and through popular fictional works about shark attacks, such as the Jaws film series. Jaws author Peter Benchley, as well as Jaws director Steven Spielberg later attempted to dispel the image <b>of</b> <b>sharks</b> as man-eating monsters.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{differences}} between the digestive systems <b>of</b> <b>sharks</b> and mammals is that sharks have much shorter intestines. This short length is achieved by the spiral valve with multiple turns within a single short section instead of a long tube-like intestine. The valve provides a long surface area, requiring food to circulate inside the short gut until fully digested, when remaining waste products pass into the cloaca.|$|E
5|$|Active-swimming predators, {{groups of}} leopard sharks often follow the tide onto {{intertidal}} mudflats to forage for food, mainly clams, spoon worms, crabs, shrimp, bony fish, and fish eggs. Most leopard sharks tend to remain {{within a particular}} area rather than undertaking long movements elsewhere, {{which has led to}} genetic divergence between populations <b>of</b> <b>sharks</b> living in different regions. This species is aplacental viviparous, meaning that the young hatch inside the uterus and are nourished by yolk. From March to June, the female gives birth to as many as 37 young after a gestation period of 10–12 months. It is relatively slow-growing and takes many years to mature.|$|E
50|$|A {{commonly}} cited {{example of}} tabloid television run amok {{is a series}} of reports in 2001 collectively dubbed the Summer <b>of</b> the <b>Shark,</b> focusing on a supposed epidemic <b>of</b> <b>shark</b> attacks after one highly publicized attack on an 8-year-old boy. In reality, there were a below-average number <b>of</b> <b>shark</b> attacks that year.|$|R

In December 2012, Dan Kitchens posted a {{controversial}} statement about finning to accompany an Instagram photo <b>of</b> <b>shark</b> fins for sale. He referred to those who engage {{in the practice of}} finning as [...] "Chinks" [...] due to Chinese consumption <b>of</b> the <b>shark</b> dorsal fin.|$|R

5|$|Although {{it is hard}} to {{test the}} hearing <b>of</b> <b>sharks,</b> they may have a sharp sense of hearing and can {{possibly}} hear prey from many miles away. A small opening on each side of their heads (not the spiracle) leads directly into the inner ear through a thin channel. The lateral line shows a similar arrangement, and is open to the environment via a series of openings called lateral line pores. This is a reminder of the common origin of these two vibration- and sound-detecting organs that are grouped together as the acoustico-lateralis system. In bony fish and tetrapods the external opening into the inner ear has been lost.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} indicates that other notable species <b>of</b> <b>sharks,</b> such as the great white shark, responded to competitive pressure from megalodon by avoiding regions it inhabited by mainly inhabiting the cooler waters of the time. In areas where their ranges seemed to overlap, such as in Pliocene Baja California, {{it is possible that}} megalodon and the great white shark occupied the area at different times of the year while following different migratory prey. Megalodon probably also had a tendency for cannibalism, much like contemporary sharks.|$|E
5|$|Launched in July 2015, Paul Allen {{is funding}} the Global FinPrint initiative, a three-year survey <b>of</b> <b>sharks</b> and rays in coral reef areas. The survey {{is the largest}} of its kind and {{designed}} to provide data to help conservation programs. The initiative is a partnership between Allen's Vulcan Inc, Stony Brook University, Florida International University, James Cook University and the Australian Institute of Marine Sciences. Survey results will be made available in summer 2018.|$|E
5000|$|Shark nets do {{not offer}} {{complete}} protection but work on the principle <b>of</b> [...] "fewer <b>sharks,</b> fewer attacks". They reduce occurrence via shark mortality. Historical shark attack figures suggest that the use <b>of</b> <b>shark</b> nets does markedly reduce the incidence <b>of</b> <b>shark</b> attack when implemented on a regular and consistent basis.|$|R
50|$|The Summer <b>of</b> the <b>Shark</b> {{refers to}} the {{coverage}} <b>of</b> <b>shark</b> attacks by American news media {{in the summer of}} 2001. The sensationalist coverage <b>of</b> <b>shark</b> attacks began in early July following the Fourth <b>of</b> July weekend <b>shark</b> attack on 8-year-old Jessie Arbogast, and continued almost unabated—despite no evidence for an actual increase in attacks—until the September 11 terrorist attacks shifted the media's attention away from beaches. The Summer <b>of</b> the <b>Shark</b> has since been remembered as an example of tabloid television perpetuating a story with no real merit beyond its ability to draw ratings.|$|R
50|$|There are a range <b>of</b> <b>shark</b> attack {{prevention}} techniques {{employed to}} reduce the risk <b>of</b> <b>shark</b> attack and keep people safe.

After the Gunmen capture her, she reveals that he had been experimenting with the immune system <b>of</b> <b>sharks</b> and had been {{grafting}} pieces of shark onto his body in order to become a living host to a biological weapon. His research had been funded by Yves's arms dealing father, who had commissioned Fletcher to find her and prevent her from stopping his biological terrorism plot. She further informs them that there is another host, whom she is trying to identify and locate before he can unleash his deadly payload.|$|E
5|$|On Amity Island, Martin Brody, {{famous for}} his role as Police Chief and his heroism during the {{previous}} events, has recently died from a heart attack. His wife, Ellen, attributes it to the fear <b>of</b> <b>sharks.</b> She now lives with Brody's younger son, Sean and his fiancée, Tiffany. Sean works as a police deputy, and is dispatched to clear a log from a buoy a few days before Christmas. A great white shark attacks and kills him, sinking his boat in the process.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of shark fisheries have little monitoring or management. The rise {{in demand for}} shark products increases pressure on fisheries. Major declines in shark stocks have been recorded—some species have been depleted by over 90% over the past 20–30 years with population declines of 70% not unusual. A study by the International Union for Conservation of Nature suggests that one quarter of all known species <b>of</b> <b>sharks</b> and rays are threatened by extinction and 25 species were classified as critically endangered.|$|E

5000|$|In Hawaii, seven {{short term}} shark culls utilising long-lines {{took place between}} 1959 and 1976. During this time, 4,668 sharks were caught, {{at a cost of}} US $300,000. Although the Hawaiian {{resident}} and tourist human population increased dramatically, the number <b>of</b> <b>shark</b> attacks remained constant (in contrast to Florida, where the number <b>of</b> <b>shark</b> attacks has increased in line with human population increases) and the short term programs were not considered a success by the authors <b>of</b> a <b>shark</b> culling study. The study concluded that the culls [...] "do not appear to have had measurable effects on the rate <b>of</b> <b>shark</b> attacks in Hawaiian waters".|$|R
5|$|The {{tiger shark}} {{is a member}} of the order Carcharhiniformes, the most species-rich order <b>of</b> <b>sharks,</b> with more than 270 species also {{including}} the small catsharks and hammerhead sharks. Members of this order are characterized by the presence of a nictitating membrane over the eyes, two dorsal fins, an anal fin, and five gill slits. It is the largest member of the Carcharhinidae family, commonly referred to as requiem sharks. This family consists of mostly slender but powerful mid- to large-sized sharks and includes some other well-known sharks, such as the blue shark (Prionace glauca), lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostris), and bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas).|$|E
5|$|When Hurricane Hugo {{destroyed}} the island's only Olympic-sized swimming pool in 1989, Duncan {{was forced to}} swim in the ocean and he quickly lost his enthusiasm for swimming because of his fear <b>of</b> <b>sharks.</b> Duncan was dealt another emotional blow when his mother {{was diagnosed with breast}} cancer and died one day before his 14th birthday. In her last days, she made Duncan and his sisters promise to finish college with a degree, which would later explain Duncan's refusal to leave college early. Duncan never swam competitively again, but was inspired by his brother-in-law to turn to basketball.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for the {{existence}} <b>of</b> <b>sharks</b> dates from the Ordovician period, 450–420 million years ago, before land vertebrates existed and before many plants had colonized the continents. Only scales have been recovered from the first sharks and not all paleontologists agree that these are from true sharks, suspecting that these scales are actually those of thelodont agnathans. The oldest generally accepted shark scales are from about 420 million years ago, in the Silurian period. The first sharks looked very different from modern sharks. The majority of modern sharks {{can be traced back}} to around 100 million years ago. Most fossils are of teeth, often in large numbers. Partial skeletons and even complete fossilized remains have been discovered. Estimates suggest that sharks grow tens of thousands of teeth over a lifetime, which explains the abundant fossils. The teeth consist of easily fossilized calcium phosphate, an apatite. When a shark dies, the decomposing skeleton breaks up, scattering the apatite prisms. Preservation requires rapid burial in bottom sediments.|$|E

50|$|Amity Point boasts some <b>of</b> {{the largest}} <b>shark</b> {{numbers in the}} world, though shark attacks are rare, with only two {{recorded}} attacks. Despite the presence <b>of</b> <b>shark</b> drumlines, in places since 1997, a Brisbane woman was mauled to death by sharks while swimming in Rainbow Channel. The species <b>of</b> <b>shark</b> remains unknown, with bull sharks suspected by an expert and tiger sharks suggested by locals.|$|R
5|$|In {{contrast}} to bony fish, {{with the exception}} of the coelacanth, the blood and other tissue <b>of</b> <b>sharks</b> and Chondrichthyes is generally isotonic to their marine environments because of the high concentration of urea (up to 2.5%) and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), allowing them to be in osmotic balance with the seawater. This adaptation prevents most sharks from surviving in freshwater, and they are therefore confined to marine environments. A few exceptions exist, such as the bull shark, which has developed a way to change its kidney function to excrete large amounts of urea. When a shark dies, the urea is broken down to ammonia by bacteria, causing the dead body to gradually smell strongly of ammonia.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, Hergé became {{increasingly}} annoyed at {{the success of}} René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo's Asterix comic book series, which various commentators had described as eclipsing The Adventures of Tintin as the foremost comic in the Franco-Belgian tradition. Hoping to imitate {{the success of the}} recent animated films Asterix the Gaul (1967) and Asterix and Cleopatra (1968), Hergé agreed to the production of two animated Belvision films based on the Adventures of Tintin. The first, Tintin and the Temple of the Sun (1969), was based on pre-existing comics, whereas the second, Tintin and the Lake <b>of</b> <b>Sharks</b> (1972) was an original story written by Greg. In 1982 the American filmmaker Steven Spielberg requested the film rights for a live-action adaptation of one of The Adventures of Tintin, a prospect that excited Hergé, but the project never came to fruition at the time.|$|E
5|$|Reported {{to be more}} {{aggressive}} than other stingarees, the sparsely-spotted stingaree readily employs its venomous sting if disturbed and can inflict a painful injury on a human. It is edible, but seldom brought to market. Fishing pressure is insignificant across large portions of this ray's range, including in the Great Australian Bight, though substantial numbers are caught incidentally by commercial fisheries off southeastern and southwestern Australia in beach seines and bottom trawls. The sparsely-spotted stingaree generally survives being captured, sorted, and discarded, though the process often causes it to abort any unborn young. Nevertheless, losses to fisheries appear to be sustainable at present, and thus the IUCN has listed this species under Least Concern. There are a number of small Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) within its range, and it would potentially benefit from the implementation of the 2004 Australian National Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management <b>of</b> <b>Sharks.</b>|$|E

5|$|Set {{apart from}} the glowing underside, the darker, nonluminescent collar tapers at {{both sides of the}} throat, and has been {{hypothesized}} to serve as a lure by mimicking the silhouette of a small fish from below. The appeal of the lure would be multiplied in a school <b>of</b> <b>sharks.</b> If the collar does function in this way, the cookiecutter shark would be the only known case of bioluminescence in which the absence of light attracts prey, while its photophores serve to prevent premature detection by incoming would-be predators. As the shark can only match a limited range of light intensities, its vertical movements likely serve to preserve the effectiveness of its disguise across various times of day and weather conditions.|$|E
5|$|Social {{aggregation}} is {{well documented}} in grey reef sharks. In the northwestern Hawaiian Islands, large numbers of pregnant adult females have been observed slowly swimming in circles in shallow water, occasionally exposing their dorsal fins or backs. These groups last from 11:00 to 15:00, corresponding to peak daylight hours. Similarly, at Sand Island off Johnston Atoll, females form aggregations in shallow water from March to June. The number <b>of</b> <b>sharks</b> per group differs from year to year. Each day, the sharks begin arriving at the aggregation area at 09:00, reaching a peak in numbers during the hottest {{part of the day}} in the afternoon, and dispersing by 19:00. Individual sharks return to the aggregation site every one to six days. These female sharks are speculated to be taking advantage of the warmer water to speed their growth or that of their embryos. The shallow waters may also enable them to avoid unwanted attention by males.|$|E
5|$|Some large shark species, such as {{the tiger}} shark, the dusky shark, the great white shark and the bull shark, prey on the {{bottlenose}} dolphin, especially calves. The bottlenose dolphin is capable of defending itself by charging the predator; dolphin 'mobbing' behavior <b>of</b> <b>sharks</b> can occasionally prove fatal for the shark. Targeting a single adult dolphin can be dangerous for a shark of similar size. Killer whale populations in New Zealand and Peru have been observed preying on bottlenose dolphins, but this seems rare, and other orcas may swim with dolphins. Swimming in pods allows dolphins to better defend themselves against predators. Bottlenose dolphins either use complex evasive strategies to outswim their predators, or mobbing techniques to batter the predator to death or force it to flee.|$|E
