5|$|Although {{five times}} more {{elements}} are metals than nonmetals, two of the nonmetals—hydrogen and helium—make up over 99 per cent of the observable Universe, and one—oxygen—makes up close to half of the Earth's crust, <b>oceans</b> <b>and</b> atmosphere. Living organisms are also composed almost entirely of nonmetals, and nonmetals form many more compounds than metals.|$|E
5|$|Archaea were {{initially}} viewed as extremophiles living in harsh environments, such as hot springs and salt lakes, {{but they have}} since been found in {{a broad range of}} habitats, including soils, <b>oceans,</b> <b>and</b> marshlands. They are also part of the human microbiota, found in the colon, oral cavity, and skin. Archaea are particularly numerous in the <b>oceans,</b> <b>and</b> the archaea in plankton {{may be one of the}} most abundant groups of organisms on the planet. Archaea are a major part of Earth's life and may play roles in both the carbon cycle and the nitrogen cycle. No clear examples of archaeal pathogens or parasites are known, but they are often mutualists or commensals. One example is the methanogens that inhabit human and ruminant guts, where their vast numbers aid digestion. Methanogens are also used in biogas production and sewage treatment, and biotechnology exploits enzymes from extremophile archaea that can endure high temperatures and organic solvents.|$|E

5|$|Earth is {{estimated}} to have formed 4.54billion years ago from the solar nebula, along with the Sun and other planets. The moon formed roughly 20million years later. Initially molten, the outer layer of the Earth cooled, resulting in the solid crust. Outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere. Condensing water vapor, {{most or all of}} which came from ice delivered by comets, produced the <b>oceans</b> <b>and</b> other water sources. The highly energetic chemistry is believed to have produced a self-replicating molecule around 4billion years ago.|$|E

5|$|Like {{many large}} rorquals, the fin whale is a {{cosmopolitan}} species. It {{is found in}} all the world's major <b>oceans</b> <b>and</b> in waters ranging from the polar to the tropical. It is absent only from waters close to the ice pack at both {{the north and south}} extremities and relatively small areas of water away from the large oceans, such as the Red Sea although they can reach into the Baltic Sea, a marginal sea of such conditions. The highest population density occurs in temperate and cool waters. It is less densely populated in the warmest, equatorial regions.|$|E
5|$|Most nemerteans are marine {{animals that}} burrow in sediments, lurk in crevices between shells, stones or the holdfasts of algae or sessile animals. Some live {{deep in the}} open <b>oceans,</b> <b>and</b> have {{gelatinous}} bodies. Others build semi-permanent burrows lined with mucus or produce cellophane-like tubes. Mainly in the tropics and subtropics, about 12 species appear in freshwater, and about a dozen species live on land in cool, damp places, for example under rotting logs.|$|E
5|$|Seabirds {{evolved to}} exploit {{different}} food {{resources in the}} world's seas and <b>oceans,</b> <b>and</b> to a great extent, their physiology and behaviour have been shaped by their diet. These evolutionary forces have often caused species in different families and even orders to evolve similar strategies and adaptations to the same problems, leading to remarkable convergent evolution, such as that between auks and penguins. There are four basic feeding strategies, or ecological guilds, for feeding at sea: surface feeding, pursuit diving, plunge diving and predation of higher vertebrates; within these guilds there are multiple variations on the theme.|$|E

5|$|The Earth {{receives}} 174petawatts (PW) {{of incoming}} solar radiation (insolation) {{at the upper}} atmosphere. Approximately 30% is reflected back to space while the rest is absorbed by clouds, <b>oceans</b> <b>and</b> land masses. The spectrum of solar light at the Earth's surface is mostly spread across the visible and near-infrared ranges with a small part in the near-ultraviolet. Most of the world's population live in areas with insolation levels of 150–300 watts/m², or 3.5–7.0 kWh/m² per day.|$|E
5|$|The diet of bigfin reef squids {{comprises}} mainly crustaceans {{and small}} fish. They {{are found in}} the temperate and tropical waters of the Pacific and Indian <b>Oceans,</b> <b>and</b> have recently been introduced into the Mediterranean as a Lessepsian migrant. They are commonly found near the shoreline, near rocks, and coral reefs. They are fished in vast quantities for human food in Asia. Because of their rapid growth rate, short life span, and tolerance to handling and captivity, bigfin reef squids are {{regarded as one of the}} most promising species for mariculture. They are also a valuable source of giant axons for medical research.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, {{areas of}} {{tropical}} cyclone formation {{are divided into}} seven basins. These include the north Atlantic Ocean, the eastern and western parts of the northern Pacific Ocean, the southwestern Pacific, the southwestern and southeastern Indian <b>Oceans,</b> <b>and</b> the northern Indian Ocean (Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal). The western Pacific is the most active and the north Indian the least active. An average of 86tropical cyclones of tropical storm intensity form annually worldwide, with 47 reaching hurricane/typhoon strength, and 20 becoming intense tropical cyclones (at least of Category 3 intensity).|$|E
5|$|A {{stratocumulus}} cloud {{is another}} type of a cumuliform or stratocumuliform cloud. Like cumulus clouds, they form at low levels and via convection. However, unlike cumulus clouds, their growth is almost completely retarded by a strong inversion. As a result, they flatten out like stratus clouds, giving them a layered appearance. These clouds are extremely common, covering on average around twenty-three percent of the earth's <b>oceans</b> <b>and</b> twelve percent of the earth's continents. They are less common in tropical areas and commonly form after cold fronts. Additionally, stratocumulus clouds reflect {{a large amount of}} the incoming sunlight, producing a net cooling effect. Stratocumulus clouds can produce drizzle, which stabilizes the cloud by warming it and reducing turbulent mixing. Being a cloud of limited convection, stratocumulus is divided into three species; stratiformis, lenticularis, and castellanus, that are common to the higher stratocumuliform genus-types.|$|E
5|$|Germany invaded both Norway and Denmark on 9 April 1940. Norway {{was very}} {{important}} to Germany for two reasons: firstly as a base for naval units to harass Allied shipping in the North Atlantic and Arctic <b>Oceans,</b> <b>and</b> secondly to secure shipments of iron ore coming in from Sweden through the port of Narvik. During Operation Weserübung, Denmark fell in less than a day, becoming the briefest invasion in recorded military history. The Norwegians put up a stiffer resistance to the invading German forces. Nonetheless, by May the southern half of Norway was under German control. Following the German invasion of France and the Low Countries, the Allies were forced to evacuate Narvik, leaving the country to the Germans who would occupy it {{until the end of the}} war. After the invasion, Vidkun Quisling led the collaborationist government of Norway, based around the fascist Nasjonal Samling ("National Gathering") party.|$|E
