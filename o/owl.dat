5|$|Less {{powerful}} woodland owls such as {{the little}} <b>owl</b> and the long-eared <b>owl</b> cannot usually co-exist with the stronger tawny owls, which may take them as food items, and are found in different habitats; in Ireland {{the absence of the}} tawny <b>owl</b> allowed the long-eared <b>owl</b> to become the dominant <b>owl.</b> Similarly, where the tawny <b>owl</b> has moved into built-up areas, it tends to displace barn owls from their traditional nesting sites in buildings.|$|E
5|$|The tawny <b>owl</b> is {{a member}} of the wood-owl genus Strix, part of the typical <b>owl</b> family Strigidae, which {{contains}} all species of <b>owl</b> other than the barn owls. Within its genus, the tawny owl's closest relatives are Hume's <b>owl,</b> Strix butleri, (formerly considered to be conspecific), the Himalayan <b>owl,</b> Strix nivicolum, (sometimes considered conspecific), its larger northern neighbour, the Ural <b>owl,</b> S. uralensis, and the North American barred <b>owl,</b> S. varia. The Early–Middle Pleistocene Strix intermedia is sometimes considered a paleosubspecies of the tawny <b>owl,</b> which would make it that species' immediate ancestor.|$|E

5|$|Pettigrew State Park is home {{to several}} species of birds of prey. Ospreys build their nests in {{the tops of the}} tallest trees in the park and feed on the {{abundant}} fish of Lake Phelps. The population of bald eagles is increasing and they are occasionally seen over the park. At least three species of <b>owl,</b> the great horned <b>owl,</b> barred <b>owl</b> and eastern screech <b>owl,</b> make their home in the forests of the park, as do red tailed and red shouldered hawks. American kestrel and northern harriers also find suitable habitats at Pettigrew State Park.|$|E
5|$|The barn <b>owl</b> (Tyto alba) is {{the most}} widely {{distributed}} species of <b>owl</b> {{and one of the}} most widespread of all birds. It is also referred to as the common barn <b>owl,</b> to distinguish it from other species in its family, Tytonidae, which forms one of the two main lineages of living owls, the other being the typical owls (Strigidae). The barn <b>owl</b> is found almost everywhere in the world except polar and desert regions, Asia north of the Himalayas, most of Indonesia, and some Pacific islands.|$|E
50|$|Predators include barn <b>owls,</b> great horned <b>owls,</b> long-eared <b>owls,</b> and short-eared <b>owls.</b> Prairie falcons {{are also}} {{reported}} as predators.

5|$|The {{mistle thrush}} is hunted by {{birds of prey}} {{including}} the boreal <b>owl,</b> short-eared <b>owl,</b> tawny <b>owl,</b> Ural <b>owl,</b> Eurasian eagle-owl, golden eagle, kestrel, common buzzard, red kite, northern goshawk, peregrine falcon, and sparrowhawk. The eggs and chicks may be targeted by cats and corvids, although the adults are fearless in defence of their nests, occasionally even attacking humans. The mistle thrush is not normally a host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite.|$|E
5|$|The tawny <b>owl</b> has a {{distribution}} stretching discontinuously across temperate Eurasia from Great Britain and the Iberian Peninsula eastwards to western Siberia. The subspecies S. a. mauritanica extends the range into northwest Africa. This essentially non-migratory <b>owl</b> is absent from Ireland (probably because of {{competition from the}} long-eared <b>owl),</b> and only a rare vagrant to the Balearic and Canary Islands.|$|E
5|$|The tawny <b>owl</b> {{or brown}} <b>owl</b> (Strix aluco) is a stocky, {{medium-sized}} <b>owl</b> {{commonly found in}} woodlands across much of Eurasia. Its underparts are pale with dark streaks, and the upperparts are either brown or grey. Several of the eleven recognised subspecies have both variants. The nest is typically in a tree hole where it can protect its eggs and young against potential predators. This <b>owl</b> is non-migratory and highly territorial. Many young birds starve if they cannot find a vacant territory once parental care ceases.|$|E

50|$|Fishing <b>owls</b> are a {{group of}} birds in the family Strigidae, the true <b>owls.</b> Fishing <b>owls</b> have {{traditionally}} been placed in the genus Scotopelia, but DNA evidence suggests they {{should be included in}} genus Bubo with the horned <b>owls</b> and eagle-owls.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} predators {{of the species}} include various <b>owls,</b> such as barn <b>owls,</b> short-eared <b>owls,</b> and lesser horned <b>owls.</b> However, various other local predators, {{including}} lesser grisons, zorros, and buzzard-eagles, may also include southern big-eared mice in their diets.|$|R
5|$|A {{majority}} of starling predators are avian. The typical response of starling groups {{is to take}} flight, with a common sight being undulating flocks of starling flying high in quick and agile patterns. Their abilities in flight are seldom matched by birds of prey. Adult common starlings are hunted by hawks such as the northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) and Eurasian sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus), and falcons including the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), Eurasian hobby (Falco subbuteo) and common kestrel (Falco tinnunculus). Slower raptors like black and red kites (Milvus migrans & milvus), eastern imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca), common buzzard (Buteo buteo) and Australasian harrier (Circus approximans) tend to take the more easily caught fledglings or juveniles. While perched in groups by night, they can be vulnerable to owls, including the little <b>owl</b> (Athene noctua), long-eared <b>owl</b> (Asio otus), short-eared <b>owl</b> (Asio flammeus), barn <b>owl</b> (Tyto alba), tawny <b>owl</b> (Strix aluco) and Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo).|$|E

5|$|Although {{many people}} believe this <b>owl</b> has {{exceptional}} night vision, its retina is no more sensitive than a human's and its asymmetrically placed ears are key to its hunting by giving it excellent directional hearing. Its nocturnal habits and eerie, easily imitated call, {{have led to a}} mythical association of the tawny <b>owl</b> with bad luck and death.|$|E

40|$|Boreal <b>owls</b> Aegolius funereus (referred to as Tengmalm’s <b>owls</b> in Europe) {{breed in}} boreal forests {{throughout}} the Holarctic region and in high-elevation subalpine forests further south. They are currently classified as seven subspecies; six found throughout Eurasia, {{and one in}} North America. The geographic distribution of boreal <b>owls</b> in North America and Eurasia is similar, as are their patterns of dispersal and irruption. Because a recent genetic study of boreal <b>owls</b> in North America found very little genetic differentiation among widely disparate locations, we expected that boreal <b>owls</b> in Eurasia similarly would have very little genetic differentiation. Using seven microsatellite markers, we analyzed genetic samples from 275 boreal <b>owls</b> in North America, 36 in Norway, and five in eastern Russia. We found no detectable genetic differentiation between Norwegian and Russian <b>owls,</b> but notable differentiation between North American and Eurasian <b>owls.</b> Low intra-continental genetic differentiation likely results from high rates of long-distance dispersal among subpopulations of boreal <b>owls.</b> In light of these results, we recommend further genetic sampling of boreal <b>owls</b> throughout Eurasia {{in order to determine}} whether six separate subspecies here are warranted...|$|R

5|$|The barn <b>owl</b> has acute hearing, with ears placed asymmetrically. This {{improves}} {{detection of}} sound position and distance {{and the bird}} does not require sight to hunt. The facial disc plays a part in this process, as is shown {{by the fact that}} with the ruff feathers removed, the bird can still locate the source in azimuth but fails to do so in elevation. Hunting nocturnally or crepuscularly, this bird can target its prey and dive to the ground, penetrating its talons through snow, grass or brush to seize small creatures with deadly accuracy. Compared to other owls of similar size, the barn <b>owl</b> has a much higher metabolic rate, requiring relatively more food. Weight for weight, barn owls consume more rodents—often regarded as pests by humans—than possibly any other creature. This makes the barn <b>owl</b> one of the most economically valuable wildlife animals for agriculture. Farmers often find these owls more effective than poison in keeping down rodent pests, and they can encourage barn <b>owl</b> habitation by providing nest sites.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} predators of greater noctule bat are barn <b>owl</b> (Tyto alba) and Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo). The greater noctule bat {{generally}} leaves its roost to forage {{after it is}} already completely dark outside, this coincides with the general time that the two mentioned <b>owl</b> species hunt. There is also some risk to the greater noctule from parasitism between bats.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the large}} numbers birds found in the Summer Lake basin, birds of prey are common. Native <b>owls</b> include great horned <b>owls,</b> barn <b>owls,</b> and short-eared <b>owls.</b> Prairie falcons, American kestrels, red-tailed hawks, Cooper's hawks, Swainson’s hawk, golden eagles, and bald eagles are {{also found in the}} Summer Lake area.|$|R

40|$|Flammulated <b>Owls</b> (Otus flammeolus) are long-distance migrants, while Northern Saw-whet <b>Owls</b> (Aegolius acadicus) exhibit more {{variable}} migration tendencies. I {{investigated the}} migratory behavior {{of these species}} using orientation cages and tested hypotheses concerning (1) the presence of migratory restlessness and orientation, (2) inter-specific differences in migratory restlessness and orientation, and (3) correlates of migratory restlessness and orientation. Only four of 16 Flammulated <b>Owls</b> displayed activity consistent with migratory restlessness although all four <b>owls</b> exhibited significant directionality in their movements. Alternatively, 59 of 97 Northern Saw-whet <b>Owls</b> exhibited activity consistent with migratory restlessness with most of these 59 <b>owls</b> showing preferred directions of orientation. Neither species oriented consistently as a group and, contrary to expectation, Northern Saw-whet <b>Owls</b> exhibited more restlessness in orientation cages. The relative lack of migratory restlessness in Flammulated <b>Owls</b> might {{be a function of}} small sample sizes or simply this particular species’ reaction to an unfamiliar situation. In Flammulated <b>Owls,</b> migratory restlessness increased with decreasing natural cloud cover, and was more pronounced in birds with larger flight muscles. Contrary to predictions, Flammulated <b>Owls</b> also showed a marginal increase in restlessness in response to decreasing furcular fat stores which could be a function of small samples sizes.
