Halfpenny and penny tokens usually, but not always, bear the denomination <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E

Failure to comply with this requirement amounts to a corrupt practice and attracts a fine of up to $1,000, imprisonment of up to 12 months or both. In addition, a convicted person is subject to the disqualifications referred to earlier.|$|E

The judgment was unanimous as to the eight members of the Court participating, as were the first two parts of Scalia's opinion that upheld the constitutionality of anticipatory warrants in general.

25|$|James Kirkland Batson was an African American man {{convicted of}} {{burglary}} and receipt of stolen goods in a Louisville, Kentucky circuit court {{by a jury}} composed entirely of white jurors. The key part of his appeal {{was based on the}} jury selection, or voir dire, phase of the trial. During this phase potential jurors are examined by the Court, the prosecution, and the defense, to determine their competence, willingness, and suitability to hear, deliberate and decide a case put to them to render a verdict. During voir dire the judge can dismiss jurors and both the prosecution and the defense have a limited number of peremptory challenges, which are accepted <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>face,</b> as the right of the party making the challenge and which they use to excuse any juror for any reason which the particular side believes will help their case.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, John Carpenter {{said in an}} Empire {{magazine}} {{interview that}} he has a story idea for The Thing II, which centers around the two surviving characters, MacReady and Childs. However, Carpenter felt that due to the higher price associated with his fee, Universal Studios will not pursue his storyline. Carpenter indicated that {{he would be able to}} secure both Kurt Russell and Keith David for the sequel. In his story, Carpenter would explain the age difference of the actors between the two installments by having frostbite <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>face</b> due to the elements until rescued. The assumption of the sequel would rely on a radio signal being successfully transmitted by Windows before Blair destroyed the communications room. Thus, after the explosion of the base camp, the rescue team would arrive and find MacReady and Childs still alive. Carpenter has not disclosed any other details.|$|E
25|$|Divers may {{test whether}} a mask {{is a good}} fit by placing it <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>face,</b> without using the straps, and gently inhaling through their nose. If the mask stays on without any help this {{indicates}} that no air is being drawn in and that the skirt is in sufficient contact with the facial skin all the way round the mask. Optimum sealing requires that hair strands do not cross under {{the edge of the}} seal, as they can provide a path for water to leak into the mask. This is more a problem with the forehead hairline than with lower facial hair, as water from the top tends to run into the eyes, while water pooling at the bottom is easily purged by exhaling a small volume of air through the nose. Most bearded divers learn to manage the slight leakage without difficulty, inconvenience, or greasing the moustache. Other factors affecting a comfortable fit are sufficient space for the nose in the nose pocket, no contact between the rigid mask frame and the bridge of the nose, and no excessive pressure on the forehead. There should also be sufficient space between the mask lenses and the face that the eyelashes do not contact the glass noticeably when blinking.|$|E

500|$|A 2013 {{review of}} museum {{specimens}} and photographs attributed to N.menagensis resulted in elevating {{two of its}} former subspecies to the species N.bancanus and N.borneanus. Additionally, N.kayan was recognized as a new species, distinct from the nominate subspecies, N.menagensis. All newly recognized or elevated species showed significant differences in their [...] "facemask"â€”the coloration patterns <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>face.</b> [...] Analysis of the facemask patterns suggests that N.kayan diverged from N.menagensis and N.borneanus through sympatric speciation (divergent evolution of organisms {{living in the same}} geographic region), while geographic barriers may account for its divergence with N.bancanus (allopatric speciation).|$|E
500|$|By November 1989, the {{estimated}} cost of the overall {{savings and loan crisis}} had reached $500 billion, and the media's coverage often highlighted Keating's role as part of what became a feeding frenzy. Keating and Lincoln Savings became convenient symbols for arguments about what had gone wrong in America's financial system and society, as well as for 1980s greed in general, and were featured in popular culture references. A deck of playing cards would be marketed, called [...] "The Savings and Loan Scandal", that featured <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>face</b> Charles Keating holding up his hand, with images of the Keating Five senators portrayed as puppets on his fingers.|$|E

[...] The review also compared the use of the holodeck in the episode as the Star Trek equal of the ninth season of Dallas, which was revealed to be a dream of Pam Ewing in the finale.

Through the diary, she learns about the story of five freedom fighters who were active in the movement: Chandrasekhar Azad, Bhagat Singh, Shivaram Rajguru, Ashfaqulla Khan, and Ram Prasad Bismil. McKinley, in his diary, states that he had met two type of people in his life, those who died without uttering a sound and those who died with lots of anguish, crying over their deaths.
