Examples of industrial applications are household appliances and heat exchanger components. In order to extend the service life of the <b>organic</b> <b>coated</b> copper a specific surface pre-treatment is often required. Nevertheless, probably because of the limited market of this application, no specific pre-treatments for copper are industrially developed, {{with the exception of}} cleaning procedures, but simply extensions of existing pre-treatments optimised for other metals (aluminium, zinc, magnesium alloys) are used. The application of silane pre-treatments as adhesion promoters for <b>organic</b> <b>coated</b> metals is remarkably increasing in the last decade, because silanes offer very good performance together with high environmental compatibility. The idea is therefore to try to develop a specific silane based pre-treatment for copper. The starting point is the existing silane products for aluminium, modifying the composition and the application conditions (concentration, pH of the bath, additives, etc.) in order to develop a high performance copper alloy pretreatment increasing the protective properties and the adhesion of a successively applied <b>organic</b> <b>coating.</b> The deposits were analysed using FT-IR spectroscopy and optical and electron microscopic observations.

Medical implants such as stents, bone screws and bone plates could be made by biodegradable metals. These implants would serve their purpose within the patient’s body and disintegrate harmlessly, eliminating a need for removal surgeries. Magnesium is a prime contender as a biodegradable metal due to its biocompatibility and biodegradability. Surface modification techniques are needed to enable its suitability for specific applications. For example, localized deliveries of drugs are needed from cardiovascular stents to treat restenosis while localized deliveries of antibiotics are needed from bone plates to treat post-operative infections. These surface coating techniques should not significantly change the underlying corrosion behavior of Magnesium while providing localized drug delivery. <b>Organic</b> <b>coating</b> such as self-assembled monolayers is a technique {{which could be used}} for localized delivery of drugs and antibiotics from the surface of magnesium. This research aims to evaluate the bio corrosion behavior of these <b>organic</b> <b>coated</b> magnesium alloys. The corrosion behavior of self-assembled monolayer coated magnesium alloy was evaluated using polarized and unpolarized methods in physiological conditions. These <b>organic</b> <b>coated</b> magnesium metals were subjected to electro chemical corrosion testing, mass loss analysis and hydrogen evolution testing. Comparison of the results obtained between the <b>Organic</b> <b>coated</b> magnesium and the control showed no statistical significant chances in the corrosion behavior. In summary, <b>organic</b> <b>coated</b> magnesium was studied for its bio corrosion properties and this study concludes that these organic coatings do not change the corrosion behavior of the underlying magnesium and thus could be used for modification of magnesium alloy for potential cardiovascular and orthopedic applications.

The subject is related to corrosion control through an <b>organic</b> <b>coating</b> paint system for steel substrates.

Also, great effort has been spent to understand the mechanisms of the coatings degradation as well as the mechanisms of anticorrosion protection given by the pigments.

40|$|The {{excellent}} {{properties of}} magnesium alloys, especially the high strength/weight ratio, make them desirable {{materials in the}} automotive industry. However, their high corrosion susceptibility has greatly limited or even prevented their larger scale use for various applications. <b>Organic</b> <b>coating</b> {{is one of the}} most effective ways to prevent magnesium alloys from corrosion. In this report, the recent progress of organic coatings on magnesium alloys and techniques for evaluating the performance of organic coatings are reviewed. As a critical layer in a normal <b>coating</b> system, <b>organic</b> <b>coating</b> has great potential to prevent magnesium alloys from corrosion attack. However, some unsolved problems currently limit the application of organic coatings. Firstly, organic coatings usually have poor adhesion if they are applied without an appropriate pre-treatment. Sol-gel coating or plasma polymerization requires the least pre-treatment prior to deposition. However, the corrosion and wear resistance of these coatings have not been documented. Secondly, it is difficult to prepare a uniform, pore-free organic layer. So, it is usually necessary to apply multiple layers of these coatings to provide sufficient/optimum corrosion and wear resistance. Finally, a number of <b>organic</b> <b>coating</b> techniques are still solvent based, which poses an environmental concern. New water-borne and powder coating technologies should be developed. In order to evaluate the performance of organic coatings on magnesium, both electrochemical and non-electrochemical techniques have been developed. Information from different techniques gives insight into the organic coating/magnesium alloy interface in different aspects. Comprehensive knowledge about the interface is indispensible for understanding the degradation of the <b>organic</b> <b>coating</b> and developing new coating strategies. (C) 2011 Elsevier BM.
