5|$|Augustine consecrated Justus as {{a bishop}} in 604, over a {{province}} including the Kentish town <b>of</b> <b>Rochester.</b> The historian Nicholas Brooks {{argues that the}} choice <b>of</b> <b>Rochester</b> was probably not {{because it had been}} a Roman-era bishopric, but rather because of its importance in the politics of the time. Although the town was small, with just one street, it was at the junction of Watling Street and the estuary of the Medway, and was thus a fortified town. Because Justus was probably not a monk (he was not called that by Bede), his cathedral clergy was very likely non-monastic too.|$|E
5|$|Besides sending Walter on {{diplomatic}} missions, King John gave Walter custody <b>of</b> <b>Rochester</b> Castle on 20 July 1202, but as Walter {{was already}} {{accounting for the}} taxes and fees of the city <b>of</b> <b>Rochester</b> to the Exchequer in 1200, {{it is possible that}} he held the castle before 1202. John also upheld the right of the archbishop to mint coins, which Walter held until his death in 1205.|$|E

5|$|A charter {{purporting}} {{to be from}} King Æthelberht, dated 28 April 604, survives in the Textus Roffensis, {{as well as a}} copy based on the Textus in the 14th-century Liber Temporalium. Written mostly in Latin but using an Old English boundary clause, the charter records a grant of land near the city <b>of</b> <b>Rochester</b> to Justus' church. Among the witnesses is Laurence, Augustine's future successor, but not Augustine himself. The text turns to two different addressees. First, Æthelberht is made to admonish his son Eadbald, who had been established as a sub-ruler in the region <b>of</b> <b>Rochester.</b> The grant itself is addressed directly to Saint Andrew, the patron saint of the church, a usage parallelled by other charters in the same archive.|$|E
5|$|According to the Domesday Book of 1086, the Bishop <b>of</b> <b>Rochester</b> {{was given}} land valued at 17s 4d in Aylesford, Kent, in {{compensation}} for land {{that became the}} site <b>of</b> <b>Rochester</b> Castle. Of the 48castles mentioned in the survey, Rochester {{is the only one}} for which property-owners were reimbursed when their land was taken to build the castle. From the 11thcentury the castle-guard was a feudal obligation in England. This often took the form of knights garrisoning castles for their lords for a set period. There is no comprehensive list of which castles were owed service in this form, but military historian Cathcart King notes that they seem to have been predominantly high-status castles. Rochester's castle-guard consisted of 60knights' fees, marking it as a particularly important fortification.|$|E
5|$|East of Brooks Avenue, NY33A {{passes through}} a small {{residential}} area before entering a more industrial neighborhood surrounding the Erie Canal and the Rochester city line. In the western portion of this area, the route meets I-390 at exit19 and intersects Buell Road (County Route162), which directly links NY33A to the airport a half-mile (0.8km) to the south. East of I-390, NY33A crosses the Erie Canal and enters the city <b>of</b> <b>Rochester,</b> at which point maintenance of NY33A shifts from the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) to the city <b>of</b> <b>Rochester.</b> On the northern bank of the waterway, the route passes under the Rochester and Southern Railroad. The surroundings become significantly more residential east of the railroad as the route heads northeastward toward downtown Rochester. However, NY33A ends roughly one mile (1.6km) west of downtown at a junction with NY33 (West Avenue). Here, Chili and West Avenues converge and NY33 continues toward downtown as West Main Street.|$|E

5|$|Much of NY31 west of Jordan was {{originally}} designated {{as part of}} a legislative route from the late 1900s to the early 1920s. NY31 itself was assigned in the mid-1920s, utilizing all of legislative Route30 (modern NY31, NY429, and NY104) west <b>of</b> <b>Rochester</b> and much of its current alignment from Rochester to Lenox. At Lenox, NY31 turned southeast to follow what is now NY316 and NY46 to NY5 in Oneida. It was realigned by 1929 to continue west to Lewiston on Ridge Road and altered in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to continue east to Utica via Verona. With the advent of U.S. Route104 (US104) , NY31 was realigned west <b>of</b> <b>Rochester</b> to follow most of its modern routing.|$|E
5|$|Romanus (died before 627) was {{the second}} bishop <b>of</b> <b>Rochester</b> and presumably {{was a member of}} the Gregorian mission sent to Kent to Christianize the Anglo-Saxons from their native Anglo-Saxon paganism.

5|$|The castle's layout {{was unusual}} for the region during this period, where the fortifications built by the Normans were {{typically}} smaller ringwork designs, and it highlighted both the strategic importance of the location {{and the power of}} its builder.

5|$|The {{first set}} of posted routes in New York were {{assigned}} in 1924. At this time, all of legislative Route20 west <b>of</b> <b>Rochester</b> became part of NY3, a cross-state route that began in North Tonawanda and ended in Plattsburgh. By 1926, NY31 was assigned to an alignment extending from Niagara Falls to Oneida. The route began at NY34 (now NY104) in Niagara Falls and followed College Avenue east to the city line, from where it continued eastward to Rochester on the alignment of legislative Route30. Within the city <b>of</b> <b>Rochester,</b> NY31 continued east on Ridge Road to Lake Avenue, where it turned south to enter downtown Rochester, becoming State Street at Lyell Avenue. At East Main Street, NY31 resumed its eastward alignment, crossing the Genesee River and continuing on Main Street to Monroe Avenue, which, at the time, connected directly with Main Street. NY31 turned right on Monroe Avenue, rejoining its present alignment of NY31 near Union Street.|$|E
5|$|The see of Canterbury {{seems at}} this time to have been passing through a period of {{comparative}} obscurity. During Deusdedit's nine years as archbishop, all the new bishops in England were consecrated by Celtic or foreign bishops, with one exception: Deusdedit consecrated Damianus, Ithamar's successor as Bishop <b>of</b> <b>Rochester.</b> Deusdedit did, however, found a nunnery in the Isle of Thanet and helped with the foundation of Medeshamstede Abbey, later Peterborough Abbey, in 657. He was long overshadowed by Agilbert, bishop to the West Saxons, and his authority as archbishop probably did not extend past his own diocese and that <b>of</b> <b>Rochester,</b> which had traditionally been dependent on Canterbury.|$|E
5|$|Between 1087 and 1089, Rufus asked Gundulf, Bishop <b>of</b> <b>Rochester,</b> {{to build}} a new stone castle at Rochester. He {{established}} the current extent of the castle. Though much altered through the centuries, some parts of Gundulf's work survive. In 1127 King HenryI granted the castle to the Archbishop of Canterbury in perpetuity. William de Corbeil built the massive keep that still dominates the castle today. Throughout the 12thcentury the castle remained in the custody of the archbishops.|$|E
