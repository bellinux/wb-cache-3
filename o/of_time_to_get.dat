5|$|Considering {{the weight}} of attack against airfields, hardly any fighters were {{destroyed}} on the ground. Figures indicated just two Spitfires and six Hurricanes were lost in this manner. The main reason for this was the high state of readiness of RAF units during daylight. The command depended on radar and the Observer Corps warning them in advance, giving them plenty <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> airborne. The successful strafing attack by Bf 109s of JG 52 on Manston depended {{on a combination of}} circumstances and chance which did not occur often during the battle.|$|E
25|$|As {{the segment}} {{came to a}} close, the {{attention}} focused on Graham Rahal, Josef Newgarden and Simona de Silvestro. All three were among the drivers attempting to make the top 24 for the day. Rahal was too slow to make the field, while de Silvestro managed to bump her way in. In the last 30 minutes, Townsend Bell made two attempts, the second of which bumped his way in. With time running out, Newgarden was bumped out by James Jakes. Newgarden ran out <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back in line to make an attempt, {{and would have to}} wait until Sunday to qualify.|$|E
25|$|Installation {{and service}} / {{maintenance}} of off-shore wind farms are a specific challenge for technology and economic {{operation of a}} wind farm. , there are 20 jackup vessels for lifting components, but few can lift sizes above 5MW. Service vessels have to be operated nearly 24/7 (availability higher than 80% <b>of</b> <b>time)</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> sufficient amortisation from the wind turbines. Therefore, special fast service vehicles for installation (like Wind Turbine Shuttle) {{as well as for}} maintenance (including heave compensation and heave compensated working platforms to allow the service staff to enter the wind turbine also at difficult weather conditions) are required. So-called inertial and optical based Ship Stabilization and Motion Control systems (iSSMC) are used for that.|$|E

The visa program fast tracks visas and eases the residency requirement {{for a permanent}} visa for those ready to invest over 5 million Australian dollars into state government bonds, specific infrastructure and property investments.

By 2017, almost 90% of the more than 1,300 foreigners who used Australia's special investor visa program were from China.

500|$|The Motion Picture {{met with}} {{negative}} reviews from critics; a 2001 retrospective for the BBC described {{the film as}} a critical failure. As of October 2017, the film holds a 44% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 36 reviews with the consensus stating: [...] "Featuring a patchwork script and a dialogue-heavy storyline whose biggest villain is a cloud, Star Trek: The Motion Picture is a less-than-auspicious debut for the franchise." [...] Gary Arnold and Judith Martin of The Washington Post felt that the plot was too thin to support {{the length of the}} film, although Martin felt that compared to such science-fiction films as , Star Wars and Alien, The Motion Pictures pretense was [...] "slightly cleverer". Times Harold Livingston wrote that the film consisted of spaceships that [...] "take an unconscionable amount <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> anywhere, and nothing of dramatic or human interest happens along the way". Livingston also lamented the lack of [...] "boldly characterized" [...] antagonists and battle scenes that made Star Wars fun; instead, viewers were presented with lots of talk, [...] "much of it in impenetrable spaceflight jargon". David Denby said that the slow movement of ships through space was [...] "no longer surprising and elegant" [...] after films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, and that much of the action consisted of the crew's reacting to things occurring on the viewscreen, which the New York Magazine critic considered to be [...] "like watching someone else watch television". Variety disagreed, calling the film [...] "a search-and-destroy thriller that includes all of the ingredients the TV show's fans thrive on: the philosophical dilemma wrapped in a scenario of mind control, troubles with the space ship, the dependable and understanding Kirk, the ever-logical Spock, and suspenseful take with twist ending". Scott Bukatman reviewed Star Trek - The Motion Picture in Ares Magazine #1. [...] Bukatman commented that [...] "With Star Trek, Roddenberry's trick has been to wear the mask of the humanist as he plays with his Erector set. The scale of the television series arrested his vision at a comfortable and still interesting level, but the new film has finally removed the mask." ...|$|E
