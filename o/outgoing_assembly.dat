5000|$|A {{little over}} {{a week after the}} {{elections}} on 15 December 2015, the <b>outgoing</b> National <b>Assembly</b> created the [...] "National Communal Parliament" [...] with President Maduro stating [...] "I'm going to give all the power to the communal parliament ... This parliament {{is going to be a}} legislative mechanism from the grassroots. All power to the Communal parliament". The move was described as an attempt [...] "to sideline and leapfrog the incoming opposition-controlled National Assembly" [...] and that such actions could possibly lead to more destability and polarization in Venezuela for the future.|$|R

50|$|The term {{in office}} of the {{incumbent}} Ombudsman, Tarek Saab, is due to run until 2021. On 10 December 2015, days after a general election in which conservative opposition parties had secured {{a majority in the}} National Assembly, the <b>outgoing</b> <b>Assembly,</b> dominated by the pro-government United Socialist Party of Venezuela, selected Judge Susana Barreiros to succeed Saab. The Assembly at the same time modified the law in an effort to prevent the incoming legislature, which opened in January 2016, from overturning the nomination. Barreiros had presided over the trial of opposition leader Leopoldo López Mendoza over his involvement in anti-government protests, and had in September 2015 convicted him of inciting riots and sentenced him to 14 years' imprisonment.|$|E
5000|$|Račan was {{appointed}} Prime Minister on 27 January 2000, by a decree of the Acting President of Croatia and Speaker of the <b>outgoing</b> <b>assembly</b> of Parliament, Vlatko Pavletić, and {{this decision was}} later confirmed by a parliamentary vote on 2 February 2000 in which 122 of 151 MPs voted in favor and 1 against the cabinet, while 1 MP abstained. [...] Račan led a coalition of SDP and HSLS, which together with a bloc of four other parties held two-thirds majority in Parliament, allowing them to amend the Constitution and transform Croatia from a semi-presidential system into a incomplete parliamentary system in November 2000 and abolish the upper chamber of Parliament, the Chamber of Counties, in March 2001. The constitutional changes of 2000 greatly limited {{the power of the}} president, but retained the direct election of that office.|$|E
50|$|The Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta (PCs) had a {{majority}} in the <b>outgoing</b> <b>Assembly.</b> As a result of the election, the Alberta New Democratic Party (NDP) were elected to {{a majority}} government under leader Rachel Notley. The NDP formed Government {{for the first time in}} Alberta history, ousting the PCs, who were reduced to third place in seats. Prentice resigned as PC leader and MLA for Calgary-Foothills on election night. The Progressive Conservatives had won every provincial election since the 1971 election, making them the longest-serving provincial government in Canadian history. This was only the fourth change of government in Alberta since Alberta became a province in 1905, and one of the worst defeats a provincial government has suffered in Canada. It also marked the first time a left-of-centre political party had formed government in Alberta since the defeat of the United Farmers of Alberta in 1935 and the Depression-era radical monetary reform policies of William Aberhart's Social Credit government.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>outgoing</b> Legislative <b>Assembly</b> had 18 members, {{of which}} three were {{appointed}} (the Chief Secretary, the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary) and 15 were elected. However, under constitutional changes passed in 2009, the new assembly will have 18 elected members. George Town gained 2 new seats, and Bodden Town gained one new seat. Each {{of the six}} districts forms a constituency, with six members elected in George Town, four each in West Bay and Bodden Town, two in Cayman Brac and Little Cayman and one in North Side and East End. [...] The members of the multi-member districts are elected by plurality-at-large voting, where every voter can vote for as many candidates as there are seats.|$|R
50|$|The <b>outgoing</b> 19th National <b>Assembly</b> {{was marked}} by {{political}} gridlock. In February 2016, Minjoo lawmakers undertook the world's longest filibuster to stall an anti-terrorism bill, and the Assembly passed {{less than a third}} of the bills introduced in its term. The Saenuri Party aimed to win a supermajority of 180 seats in the 2016 election so that it could ease the gridlock by repealing the existing requirement for three-fifths of the Assembly to agree to the introduction of each bill.|$|R
5000|$|On June 30, {{results from}} the Ministry of Territorial Administration showed the ruling PCT winning 23 seats out of the 44 seats {{declared}} {{in the first round}} [...] (21 in the north and two in the south). Another 12 seats went to its allies: four for the MCDDI, three for the Movement for Action and Revival, two for the Patriotic Union for Democracy and Progress, one for the Movement for Solidarity, one for the Club 2002 PUR, and one for To Act for Congo. Seven seats were won by independent candidates, who were considered to be allies of the ruling party, and two were won by the opposition UPADS. Joseph Kignoumbi Kia Mboungou, the President of the UPADS Parliamentary Group in the <b>outgoing</b> National <b>Assembly,</b> denounced the election as [...] "faked" [...] and said that the voter lists were [...] "totally false".|$|R
5000|$|Venezuela's {{municipal}} elections were delayed from their intended date of 14 April 2013 {{after the death}} of President Hugo Chávez, as a new presidential election was also assigned for that date. Winning by a narrow margin, Nicolás Maduro was sworn in as the new president on 19 April 2013. After around an eight-month delay, {{municipal elections}} on December 8, 2013 elected 337 mayors and 2,455 local councillors for their respective 2013-2017 terms. The parliamentary elections in 2015 were held on 6 December 2015 to elect the 164 deputies and three indigenous representatives of the National Assembly. The result was a decisive defeat for the ruling PSUV, which lost control of the Assembly {{for the first time since}} 1999. The Democratic Unity Roundtable (MUD) won the majority of seats. A week after the 2015 parliamentary elections, the <b>outgoing</b> National <b>Assembly</b> created the [...] "National Communal Parliament" [...] with President Maduro stating [...] "All power to the Communal parliament". The move was described as an attempt [...] "to sideline and leapfrog the incoming opposition-controlled National Assembly." [...] The process to hold a Venezuelan recall referendum to vote on recalling Maduro was started on May 2, 2016. As of July 2016, the Venezuelan government had stated that if enough signatures were collected in the second petition stage, a recall vote would be held no sooner than 2017.|$|R
50|$|The {{selection}} of the National Spiritual Assembly is indirect using an electoral-unit delegation method. The nation is divided into voting districts or units. In each district the members are charged with selecting one or more delegates who will attend the annual national convention and vote {{for the members of}} the National Spiritual Assembly. The members at the local level are free to vote for any adult Baha’i(s) in the district or unit in good standing, keeping in mind the guidance from Shoghi Effendi that the individuals should, “combine the necessary qualities of unquestioned loyalty, of selfless devotion, of a well-trained mind, of recognized ability and mature experience...” The delegates elected at the local level have two principal duties to carry out at the national convention - to elect the National Spiritual Assembly and to make recommendations to that body on issues relevant to it. In a process parallel to the one at the local level, the delegates to the national convention are free to vote for the nine individuals who they feel will best carry out the duties of the National Spiritual Assembly. They are also free to voice any relevant concerns they have to the delegation and to the <b>outgoing</b> and incoming <b>Assemblies.</b> While the delegates can certainly convey to the convention the concerns of those in their district, they are in no way obligated to represent those who elected them. In addition, no input is provided to the delegates, either at the local or national levels, on whom to vote for in the national election. The number of delegates per country is determined by the Universal House of Justice according {{to the size of the}} national community; the National Spiritual Assembly determines the geographic area covered by each unit/district.|$|R
