40|$|How do {{domestic}} political conditions shape when leaders get punished for backing down in international crises? We explore how three factors—the president’s partisanship, {{the reaction of}} other elites, and whether the president justifies his decision {{on the basis of}} new information—influence the size of domestic audience costs. While standard theories in American politics suggest that partisanship should exert a large effect over voter behavior, we offer an alternative theory explaining why the president’s unique informational advantage following a crisis will mute partisanship’s effect on audience costs. We argue that the president’s justification for why he backed down, however, will have a large effect on audience costs. Using a series of original survey experiments, we find strong support for our theoretical argument. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for the role of partisanship, framing, and the audience costs literature more broadly.

These questions are important. Nondemocracies are prevalent around the world. According {{to data from}} the POLITY IV (2000) project, which provides a widely used dataset on the authority characteristics of modern polities {{over the last two}} centuries, nondemocratic regimes ruled the majority of countries, and the majority of the world’s population, until 1991. Even since 1991, more than 40 percent of countries and people were ruled by nondemocratic regimes. Political economy theory devoted to the modeling of democratic institutions might there-fore miss much of the world’s public sector activity. A comparison of democracies and nondemocracies may also enhance the understanding of democratic institutions by providing an empirical test of some important implications of formal voting models. We begin this paper by contrasting two schools of thought about determinants of policy: one that emphasizes the role of voting mechanisms in determining policy and a second that argues that democ-racy and other political mechanisms will be (at most) second-order determinants of policy choices once economic and demographic variables are taken into account...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Flows {{in natural}} uid layers are often forced {{simultaneously}} at scales smaller and {{much larger than}} the depth. For example, Earth atmospheric ows are powered by gradients of solar heating: vertical gradients cause three-dimensional (3 D) convection while horizontal gradients drive planetary scale ows. Nonlinear interactions spread energy over scales. The question is whether intermediate scales obtain their energy from a large-scale 2 D ow or from a small-scale 3 D turbulence. The paradox is that 2 D <b>ows</b> <b>do</b> not transfer energy downscale while 3 D turbulence does not support an upscale transfer. Here we demonstrate experimentally how a large-scale vortex and a small-scale turbulence conspire to provide for an upscale energy cascade in thick layers. We show that a strong planar vortex suppresses vertical motions thus facilitating an upscale energy cascade. In a bounded system, spectral condensation into a box-size vortex provides for a self-organized planar ow which secures an upscale energy transfer. 1...|$|R

Furthermore, young and older participants’ estimation performance was influenced by physical features of stimuli only for very large numerosities, presumably because these are poorly represented in long-term memory.

If countries within the RTA have fewer options for world trade beyond the RTA, they will almost always develop strong institutions, such as mechanisms for dispute settlement, and make substantial use of them.

The spasmoneme, the contractile organelle inside the stalk, is a mechanochemical engine employing calcium ions as the energy source. In this thesis, I evaluate the lower and upper bounds of the contraction force of the Vorticella stalk and analyze the contraction dynamics and energetics. The lower limit is the peak contraction force in normal contraction, and Stokes' law was used with the contraction force equated to the drag force on the spherically shrunken zooid. However, contraction-induced water <b>ow</b> <b>does</b> not satisfy approximations for Stokes' law because the Stokes number and Reynolds number greater than unity show that the induced ow is not only transient but also non-creeping and because the visualized ow shows that it is limited by the substrate. Instead of Stokes' law, I employ computational uid dynamic simulations and propose a contraction force estimation model. Simulation-based estimates reveal that the combined effect of the unsteadiness, finite Reynolds numbers and the substrate comprises 35 % of the total force and that <b>the</b> work <b>done</b> in <b>the</b> early phase of contraction and the maximum power output are similar regardless of the medium viscosity. To measure the upper limit, the isometric force of the spasmoneme, I apply viscous uid ow to Vorticella with a micro fluidic channel. (cont.) As the drag force increases, the cell contracts over shorter distance with lower speed, and latency between the zooid and stalk contraction increases whereas contraction propagation is not affected. The spasmoneme develops the contraction force at a rate of 4050 nN/msec. The isometric force, in the order of 100 nN, linearly depends on the stalk length, and this linear dependence (2. 5 nN/ 1 m of the spasmoneme) enables estimating contractile force per lament of the spasmoneme. In terms of energetics, Vorticella in ow behaves differently than it does in stagnant media: the total work is constant regardless of the stall force whereas the maximum power output decreases as the stall force increases. by Sangjin Ryu.

For now, {{let us say}} that small scale dynamos have no mean ow (U = 0) and produce no mean eld (B = 0). Here we reserve {{ourselves}} some freedom in the denition of meaningful averages (ensemble, time, or spatial averages over one or two coordinate directions, depending {{on the nature of}} the problem). Large scale dynamos produce a mean eld (B 6 = 0), but may or may not have a mean ow (and W J versus 2 dynamos, for example). By this denition, dynamos in Taylor-Green <b>ows</b> [1] <b>do</b> have a nite time-averaged ow and would not be small scale dynamos. Large scale dynamos. All known large scale dynamos (, W J, and 2 dynamos) produce magnetic helicity, which reacts back on the dynamo. As a consequence, the mean eld saturates at a low value...|$|R
