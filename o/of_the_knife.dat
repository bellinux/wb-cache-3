5|$|As the greenstone belts were forming, volcanoes ejected tephra {{into the}} air which settled as sediments to become {{compacted}} into the greywackes and mudstones <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Knife</b> Lake and Lake Vermilion formations. Greywackes are poorly sorted mixtures of clay, mica and quartz that may be derived from the decomposition of pyroclastic debris; {{the presence of this}} debris suggests that some explosive volcanic activity had occurred in the area earlier. The volcanism took place on the surface and the other deformations took place at various depths. Numerous earthquakes accompanied the volcanism and faulting.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} {{had trouble}} with the censors over several segments in this episode. The opening segment of the episode, which features a Fox censor named Fox Censor (pictured on the left) being stabbed to death, was pitched by David Mirkin and {{had a difficult time}} getting through the real-life censors. They had issues with the size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>knife</b> and the sound effects used. Originally, the TV-rating was supposed to stab Censor with a dagger, but Fox objected because it was too gruesome and was changed to a cutlass. The censors also objected to an unaired scene where Homer does his naked church dance on an altar. The scene was reanimated so that Homer was dancing naked in the front row.|$|E

25|$|During {{the long}} history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>knife</b> as a weapon, many systems or schools of knife {{fighting}} have developed around the world.

These were in turn adapted and improved upon through long practice and drills, sometimes over hundreds of years.|$|E

25|$|Carr's natural father, Lucien Carr, was a writer, {{who in the}} 1940s was at {{the center}} of a group of as-yet unknown writers (Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and William Burroughs). In the summer of 1944, he killed his former scoutmaster, a man who was enamoured with him. One night, the scoutmaster {{supposedly}} made a move on Carr, and Carr stabbed him in the chest with his Boy Scout knife.

25|$|The bolt in {{the bolt}} lock is a {{rectangle}} of metal that is constrained to slide only back and forward. When the knife is open a spring biases the bolt to the forward position where it rests above the tang {{of the blade}} preventing the blade from closing. Small knobs extend through the handle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>knife</b> on both sides allowing the user to slide the bolt backwards freeing the knife to close. The Axis Lock used by knife maker Benchmade is functionally identical to the bolt lock except that it uses a cylinder rather than a rectangle to trap the blade. The Arc Lock by knife maker SOG {{is similar to the}} Axis Lock except the cylinder follows a curved path rather than a straight path.|$|E
25|$|The knife must be {{minimally}} {{slightly longer}} than the neck but preferably at least 2 times {{as long as the}} animal's neck is wide, but not so long that the weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>knife</b> is deemed excessive. If the knife is too large, it is assumed to cause Derasah, excessive pressing. Kosher knife makers sell knives of differing sizes depending on the animal. Shorter blades may technically be used depending on the number of strokes employed to slaughter the animal but the normative practice today is that shorter blades are not used. The knife must not have a point. It is feared a point may slip into the wound during slaughter and cause Haladah, covering, of the blade. The blade may also not be serrated, as serrations cause Iqqur, tearing.|$|E
25|$|In 1875 his {{attention}} {{was called to}} the dressing of fur skins, such as buffalo hides. Using existing processes, it took from two to {{two and a half}} days of hard labor to bring a large hide down to a flexiable state. When House claimed that he could make a machine that could dress four hides or more a day, they were astonished, as they claimed no tool could stand up to those dry hides for even ten minutes. To meet the challenge, House developed a rotary plane with a ring knife that could be fed as it moved, with a set of small emery wheels each side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>knife</b> so that it was sharpened on every revolution. The plane was universally hung and counterbalanced so it weighed nothing in the hand of the operator, though it was driven by power from the engine. On a wager, the first operator finished fifty hides in ten hours.|$|E

25|$|In costume, the Ghostfaces share a ritualistic mannerism of {{gripping}} {{the blade of}} their knife between thumb and forefinger and wiping it clean of any blood following a murder by drawing their hand from handle to the tip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>knife.</b> This characteristic {{was given to the}} character by stuntman Dane Farwell who wore the costume for many of its scenes in Scream. Each killer is depicted as possessing effective physical abilities, such as the capabilities of nearly flawless stealth, prowling without being detected, moving silently, and efficiently vanishing from their targets' defense. Additionally, the killer tends to display sufficient strength that allows them to overpower victims, such as in Scream 2, in regards to defeating two trained detectives single-handedly. Ghostface is shown to be able to sustain and even ignore severe levels of physical damage, surviving blunt trauma, stabbing wounds and gunshots. Billy, Mickey, Roman, and Jill all had to be shot through the head or multiple times to the chest to be killed, despite having sustained severe injuries prior.|$|E

500|$|The {{soundtrack of}} {{screeching}} violins, violas, and cellos was an original all-strings piece by composer Bernard Herrmann titled [...] "The Murder". Hitchcock {{originally intended to}} have no music for the sequence (and all motel scenes), but Herrmann insisted he try his composition. Afterward, Hitchcock agreed it vastly intensified the scene, and nearly doubled Herrmann's salary. The blood in the scene is reputed to have been Bosco chocolate syrup, which shows up better on black-and-white film, and has more realistic density than stage blood. The sound <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>knife</b> entering flesh was created by plunging a knife into a casaba melon.|$|E
