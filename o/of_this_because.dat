25|$|In {{the wake}} of the arrest, it came out that the manager of the {{newspaper}} delivery agency in Higashisumiyoshi Ward had made a report to the police that a newspaper subscription fee of 230,000 yen had been stolen. Afterwards, the manager discovered that the thief was Kobayashi, now working in Kawai. On November 17, 2004, the day of the kidnapping, a judge had issued an arrest warrant for Kobayashi for the embezzlement reported by the manager. However, the manager did not inform the police <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> <b>because</b> he was promised that the suspect would repay him for the stolen money with monthly payments. Therefore, the police were not able to arrest Kobayashi, and he was free to commit his attack.|$|E
500|$|The police {{decided to}} wait to see if the {{radicals}} would surrender on their own. [...] After three days without a surrender offer from the hostage-takers, the police shut off the electricity to the lodge and set up loudspeakers from which the parents of several of the radicals implored them to surrender, to no avail. [...] One of the participating parents' son had been killed in the purge incident, but both the police and the parent were unaware <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>because</b> {{the full extent of the}} purge had not yet become known.|$|E
3000|$|The two {{facets of}} {{organizational}} pride were each measured with two items.

Organizational pride in employees’ abilities was measured with “I am proud <b>of</b> <b>this</b> organization <b>because</b> employees in <b>this</b> organization possess great abilities” and “I am proud <b>of</b> <b>this</b> organization <b>because</b> employees in <b>this</b> organization are very competent” (α = [...]. 91).

500|$|In the Bihać prison, the Tuzla group {{created a}} {{literary}} magazine named [...] "Almanah" [...] (Almanac). In its {{first and only}} issue, Mladen contributed several poems and an essay. Its editor-in-chief was Ilić, while Sreten Stojanović and Kosta Hakman contributed illustrations. The Stojanović brothers and Ilić learned French during their incarceration. The trial of the Tuzla group was held between 13 and 30September 1915 in Bihać. Ilić was sentenced to death, Mladen to sixteen years' imprisonment, {{and the other members}} of the group received sentences between ten months and fifteen years. Especially aggravating for Ilić and Mladen was their participation in the 1912 military training in Serbia. The Austrians became aware <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>because</b> their army temporarily took Loznica in western Serbia at the beginning of World War I, and there they found National Defence documents containing records of all Bosnians that attended the training.|$|E
500|$|Gordimer says Rosa's role {{in society}} is {{imprinted}} on her from a young age by her activist parents, and she grows up {{in the shadow of}} her father's political legacy. Scholar Carol P. Marsh-Lockett writes that everyone sees Rosa as Lionel Burger's daughter with duties and responsibilities to her father, and not Rosa the individual. In fulfilling these expectations, she denies herself an identity of her own. JanMohamed says it is only when Conrad encourages her to look beyond her self-sacrifices that Rosa starts examining the conflicts in her life, namely her commitment to help others versus her desire for a private life. In an attempt to resolve these conflicts, Rosa contemplates turning to blacks, but she is wary <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>because,</b> according to the book's anonymous narrator, white South Africans tend to use blacks as a way [...] "of perceiving sensual redemption, as romantics do, or of perceiving fears, as racialists do". JanMohamed notes that Rosa's father was a romantic who established genuine friendships with blacks to overcome his [...] "sensual redemption", but she is unsure of where she stands. Visel says that Rosa's only way to free herself from these commitments to her family and the revolution is to [...] "defect" [...] and go to France. John Cooke, in his essay [...] "Leaving the Mother's House", notes that [...] "By putting her defection in such stark terms, Gordimer makes her strongest statement of the need, whatever the consequence, of a child to claim a life of her own".|$|E

2500|$|When Jewitt got {{on board}} the Lydia he looked very wild, painted red and black, wrapped in a bear skin and with green leaves through his topknot. [...] Nonetheless, the captain welcomed him as a Christian and asked his advice {{about what to do}} with Maquinna. When he heard what exactly had {{happened}} to the Boston, he was inclined to execute him, but Jewitt persuaded him of the impolicy <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> <b>because</b> it would lead to further attacks on other ships visiting. Jewitt negotiated for the return of what property remained of the Boston: its cannons, anchors, and remnants of its cargo, and especially the ship's papers, which he had secured in a chest all those years ago. Once these were {{on board the}} Lydia, Maquinna was released, and the brig immediately weighed anchor and left Nootka Sound.|$|E
2500|$|Sandy Cooper: {{played by}} Valerie Mahaffey, Sandy {{is a friend}} of Joe's, Brian's, and Helen's from high school. [...] She has an insane, obsessive crush on Joe, but he is unable to {{convince}} anyone else <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>because</b> she acts completely normal except when she is alone with Joe, who gives her the nickname [...] "Psycho Sandy". She appears on Nantucket occasionally and carefully plans her fantasy life with [...] "Joey Bear" [...] at moments when the two of them are alone. Her fantasies include a re-enacted high school prom in the basement of her old house, the couple's wedding and honeymoon in Helen's living room, and the birth of their first child in Joe's therapist's office. [...] In one episode, Sandy is shown to be dating Brian, but the relationship is never pursued by the show's writers.|$|E
2500|$|Two Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) {{signs on}} Crosstown Highway {{identify}} {{the community as}} the [...] "Village of Orson." [...] In Pennsylvania, a village is an unincorporated community within a township, but PennDOT identifies most villages with roadside signs, a fact that might reasonably lead those unfamiliar with this practice to believe that these communities are incorporated municipalities administered separately from the townships {{in which they are}} located. Since Pennsylvania's villages, including Orson, are, in fact, not municipalities in their own right, they do not have official boundaries, and the United States Census Bureau does not collect statistics for them (unless, unlike Orson, they are census-designated places). In spite <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> <b>because</b> of strong local consensus, as well as the fact that many features are named for the villages they are associated with, it is almost always possible to consistently determine whether a particular feature is in one village or another.|$|E

2500|$|This {{refractory}} period {{makes it harder}} for females to mate, and females will continue to have difficulty as their age and mating frequency increase. [...] Males who have recently copulated will not transfer as many nutrients to their next mate, but will spend a longer duration of time for each mating. [...] This increases the mating costs for females because they are spending more time copulating and receiving fewer nutrients from the ejaculate. [...] Males take advantage <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>because</b> females do not reduce their mating costs by copulating with virgin males. [...] In addition, males will transfer the most methyl salicylate to their first mate to ensure its paternity. [...] However, a female who mates with a virgin male will have the most difficulty re-mating, therefore delaying her from engaging in the preferred polyandry. [...] Males tailor their ejaculate {{in the sense that the}} first ejaculate is meant to prolong the {{refractory period}} of the female, and every subsequent ejaculate is meant to maximize efficiency in sperm competition.|$|E
2500|$|The {{trailing}} side of {{the rotary}} engine's combustion chamber develops a squeeze stream which pushes back the flame front. With the conventional one or two-spark-plug system and homogenous mixture, this squeeze stream prevents the flame from propagating to the combustion chamber's trailing side in the mid and high engine speed ranges. Kawasaki dealt with that problem in its US patent , and Toyota obtained a 7% economy improvement by placing a glow-plug in the leading site, and using Reed-Valves in intake ducts. This poor combustion in the trailing side of chamber {{is one of the}} reasons why there is more carbon monoxide and unburnt hydrocarbons in a Wankel's exhaust stream. A side-port exhaust, as is used in the Mazda Renesis, avoids one of the causes <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>because</b> the unburned mixture cannot escape. The Mazda 26B avoided this problem through the use of a three spark-plug ignition system. (At the 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race in 1991, the 26B had significantly lower fuel consumption than the competing reciprocating piston engines. All competitors had the same amount of fuel available due to the Le Mans limited fuel quantity rule.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In the Katamon quarter, we {{were held}} up by a Jewish Army type jeep placed in a road block and filled with men in Jewish Army uniforms. At the same moment, I saw an armed man coming from this jeep. I took little notice <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>because</b> I merely thought it was another checkpoint. However, he put a Tommy gun {{through the open window}} on my side of the car, and fired point blank at Count Bernadotte and Colonel Serot. I also heard shots fired from other points, and there was {{considerable}} confusion... Colonel Serot fell in the seat in back of me, and I saw at once that he was dead. Count Bernadotte bent forward, and I thought {{at the time he was}} trying to get cover. I asked him: 'Are you wounded?' He nodded, and fell back.... When we arrived ... I carried the Count inside and laid him on the bed.... I took off the Count's jacket and tore away his shirt and undervest. I saw that he was wounded around the heart and that there was also a considerable quantity of blood on his clothes about it. When the doctor arrived, I asked if anything could be done, but he replied that it was too late.|$|E
