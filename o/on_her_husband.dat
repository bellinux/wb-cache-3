5|$|Pauline {{attempts}} {{to sell her}} house to Pollicut, who demands that she becomes his mistress – his reason for putting a bounty <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband.</b> Pauline bitterly refuses.

Before leaving, Burnett requests that the townspeople provide food for the outlaws. Meanwhile, Pauline becomes romantically and sexually involved with Silence while tending his wounds.|$|E
5|$|Charles and Zita were crowned in Budapest on 30 December 1916. Following the {{coronation}} {{there was a}} banquet, but after that the festivities ended, as the emperor and empress thought it wrong to have prolonged celebrations {{during a time of}} war. At the beginning of the reign, Charles was more often than not away from Vienna, so he had a telephone line installed from Baden (where Charles's military headquarters were located) to the Hofburg. He called Zita several times a day whenever they were separated. Zita had some influence <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> and would discreetly attend audiences with the Prime Minister or military briefings, and she had a special interest in social policy. However, military matters were the sole domain of Charles. Energetic and strong-willed, Zita accompanied her husband to the provinces and to the front, as well as occupying herself with charitable works and hospital visits to the war-wounded.|$|E

5|$|Though he {{lost the}} 1976 Republican nomination, Ronald Reagan ran again for the {{presidency}} in 1980, and succeeded in winning the nomination and election. During this second campaign, Nancy played a very prominent role, and her management of staff became more apparent. She arranged a meeting among feuding campaign managers John Sears and Michael Deaver, and her husband, which resulted in Deaver leaving the campaign and Sears being given full control. After the Reagan camp lost the Iowa Caucus and fell behind in New Hampshire polls, Nancy organized a second meeting and {{decided it was time}} to fire Sears and his associates; she gave Sears a copy of the press release announcing his dismissal. Her influence <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> became particularly notable; her presence at rallies, luncheons, and receptions increased his confidence.|$|E

25|$|In The Tenant vice is {{not unique}} to the men. Lady Lowborough's {{adultery}} has a particularly devastating effect <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband,</b> and the malice of Eliza Millward is poisonous to the entire community. The eternal struggle between good and evil is emphasised by heavy use of biblical references: sinners who repent and listen to reason are brought within the fold, while those who remain stubborn tend to meet violent or miserable ends.|$|E
25|$|A legend {{links the}} temple to Gundicha, {{the queen of}} Indradyumna (the legendary builder of the main temple) - after whom the Gundicha Temple is named.

Impressed by the image, she insisted <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> building the temple for the deity and starting the Ratha Yatra.

Thanks to the intervention of his maternal grandmother, the 4-year-old Crown Prince Alexander was sent to Italy with the Count and Countess of Robilant, friends of the royal couple.

25|$|When Genie's father reached {{adulthood}} {{he changed}} his first name to one which was more typically masculine, and his mother began {{to spend as much}} time with him as she could. He became almost singularly fixated on his mother, despite their relentless arguments about her attempts to convince him to adopt a less rigid lifestyle, and treated all other relationships as secondary at best. Soon after Genie's parents married, he prevented his wife from leaving home and beat her with increasing frequency and severity. Her eyesight steadily deteriorated due to lingering effects from the existing neurological damage, the onset of severe cataracts, and a detached retina in one eye, leaving her increasingly dependent <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband.</b>|$|E

25|$|Isabella was {{a refined}} and {{intelligent}} woman {{who liked to}} be surrounded by artists and poets. She was a generous patron of the arts. In politics, she had a great influence on her son, but even more so <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband,</b> whom she represented on several diplomatic conferences and for whom she governed when he was absent. Most notably, she negotiated many of the marriages of the members of her court, among them the marriage of her son Charles to Catherine of France. She also took special pains on behalf of Mary of Guelders, who attended upon Catherine. Isabella helped arrange her marriage to James II of Scotland, which would make her queen.|$|E
25|$|Ultimately, it was Lady Caroline who prevailed <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> {{to agree}} to a formal {{separation}} in 1825. Both parties had had numerous extramarital affairs by that time and Lamb had long been known to eschew duplicity. She took up permanent residence at Brocket Hall. Her struggle with mental instability became more pronounced in her last years, complicated by her abuse of alcohol and laudanum. By 1827, she was under the care of a full-time physician as her body, which had always been frail, began to shut down and she retained fluids (a condition then known as dropsy, and now known as oedema). William Lamb was Chief Secretary for Ireland by that time and made a perilous crossing to be by her side when Lady Caroline died on 25 January 1828.|$|E
25|$|William soon {{dismissed}} the old ministry when he succeeded his childless brother as king in 1861 and appointed liberal ministers of his own, notably {{from his own}} court at Koblenz, including: Alexander von Schleinitz, who became Foreign Secretary; August von Bethmann, who became Minister of Culture; and Karl Anton of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen who became Minister President of Prussia. The conservative opponents saw this {{as the work of}} Augusta, but her political influence on William was rather small. This became evident a few months later, when he dissolved parliament, which was not bending to his will. The King appointed Otto von Bismarck as the new Prussian Minister President. Augusta, now Queen, regarded Bismarck as her mortal enemy and Bismarck likewise despised Augusta for her (albeit small) influence <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband.</b>|$|E
