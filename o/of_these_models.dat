5|$|Partly {{because of}} {{theoretical}} and mathematical difficulties {{and partly because}} of the extremely high energies (beyond what is technologically possible for the foreseeable future) needed to test these theories experimentally, there is so far no experimental evidence that would unambiguously point to any <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>models</b> being a correct fundamental description of nature. This has led some in the community to criticize these approaches to unification and question the value of continued research on these problems.|$|E
5|$|The most talked-about {{applications}} <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>models</b> {{in recent}} years have been their use to infer the consequences of increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, primarily carbon dioxide (see greenhouse gas). These models predict an upward trend in the global mean surface temperature, with the most rapid increase in temperature being projected for the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere.|$|E

5|$|The Egyptians also {{interacted with}} deities through the {{donation}} of offerings, ranging from simple bits of jewelry to large and finely carved statues and stelae. Among their contributions were statues that sat in temple courts, serving as memorials to the donors after their deaths and receiving {{portions of the}} temple offerings to sustain the donors' spirits. Other statues served as gifts to the temple god, and inscribed stelae conveyed to the resident deity the donors' prayers and messages of thanks. Over the centuries, {{so many of these}} statues accumulated within a temple building that priests sometimes moved them out of the way by burying them in caches beneath the floor. Commoners offered simple wooden or clay models as votives. The form <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>models</b> may indicate the reason for their donation. Figurines of women are among the most common types of votive figures, and some are inscribed with a prayer for a woman to bear a child.|$|E
5|$|Thunderbolt technology, Sandy Bridge dual core Intel Core i5 and i7 (on the 13-inch model) or quad-core i7 (on the 15- and 17-inch models) processors, {{and a high}} {{definition}} FaceTime camera were added on February 24, 2011. Intel HD Graphics 3000 come integrated with the CPU, while the 15- and 17-inch models also utilize AMD Radeon HD 6490M and Radeon HD 6750M graphics cards. Later editions <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>models,</b> following the release of OS X Lion, replaced the dashboard (F4) key with a launchpad key. The chassis bottoms are also engraved differently from the 2010 models. The Thunderbolt serial bus platform can achieve speeds of up to 10Gbit/s, which is up to {{twice as fast as}} the USB 3.0 specification, 20 times faster than the USB 2.0 specification, and up to 12 times faster than FireWire 800. Apple says that Thunderbolt can be used to drive displays or to transfer large quantities of data in a short amount of time.|$|E
5|$|When the Phase II {{series was}} in development, {{original}} series designer Matt Jefferies updated the Enterprise design to feature a larger saucer with twin elevators (turbolifts) to the bridge, a wider secondary hull, docking ports, a dedicated photon torpedo weapon assembly {{at the base}} of the ship's neck, and angled struts supporting the nacelles. The nacelles themselves were completely changed to less cylindrical shapes and designed to feature glowing grilles on the sides. Likewise, an orbiting drydock, space office complex, and V'ger has been designed by artist Mike Minor. At the time Phase II was cancelled a roughly five foot long model of the Enterprise was under construction by Don Loos of Brick Price Movie Miniatures, and models of the drydock and V'ger were under construction as well. All <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>models</b> were abandoned, unfinished (although a Brick Price Enterprise was repurposed as the exploded Enterprise wreck in Star Trek III: The Search for Spock).|$|E

40|$|Let $M$ be a monoid. We {{construct}} {{a family of}} model structures on the category of $M$-spaces.

25|$|FiveThirtyEight applied two {{separate}} models to forecast the 2016 Presidential Primary elections – Polls-Only and Polls-Plus models.

25|$|Jeffress {{was known}} for {{building}} and testing models to simulate components of the auditory system.

25|$|Many machine models {{different}} from the standard multi-tape Turing machines have been proposed in the literature, for example random access machines. Perhaps surprisingly, each <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>models</b> {{can be converted to}} another without providing any extra computational power.

25|$|A full {{solution}} of QCD should give a full {{description of the}} vacuum, confinement and the hadron spectrum.
