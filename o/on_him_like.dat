500|$|The second-season episode [...] "Ron and Tammy," [...] which {{predominantly}} featured Ron and {{his second}} ex-wife, is widely {{considered one of the}} best Parks and Recreation episodes.

An image of a fake flavor of Ron Swanson-themed Ben & Jerry's ice cream, called [...] "All of the Bacon & Eggs You Have," [...] was designed and circulated on the Internet. The Ben & Jerry's corporation responded positively to the image, and said in a statement, [...] "Ron's beliefs are in accordance with those of Ben & Jerry's – where two scoops of government can help the less fortunate and truly be a servant to the community and its citizens." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{went downstairs}} and ate his meal alone. Nurse served <b>him.</b> She <b>liked</b> waiting <b>on</b> <b>him.</b> All women <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> and <b>liked</b> {{to do things}} for him.|$|R

6000|$|... "How could I help it? His {{face was}} made of a fiddle, as they say, for a' body that looked <b>on</b> <b>him</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him.</b> And a braw soldier he was. Oh, an ye had but seen him down at the brigg there, fleeing about like a fleeing dragon to gar folk fight that had unto little will till 't! There was he and that sour Whigamore they ca'd Burley: if twa men could hae won a field, we wadna hae gotten our skins paid that day." ...|$|R
60|$|There were knives {{drawn on}} every side of him, as these words were spoken, and the grim and {{distorted}} countenances which glared <b>on</b> <b>him</b> were <b>like</b> those of wolves rushing on their prey.|$|R
60|$|He {{never thought}} of her. Only his terror of the hours of night grew <b>on</b> <b>him,</b> obsessed <b>him</b> <b>like</b> a mania. He slept fitfully, with {{constant}} wakings of anguish. The fear wore away the core of him.|$|R
60|$|Freddie {{produced}} a snowy handkerchief, and polished his eye-glass. Solemnity descended <b>on</b> <b>him</b> <b>like</b> a cloud. He looked at Jill with an earnest, paternal gaze.|$|E
6000|$|Elsley looked inquiringly at Tom; he had learnt now {{to consult}} his eye, and lean <b>on</b> <b>him</b> <b>like</b> a child. Tom looked a stout yes, and Elsley said languidly,-- ...|$|E

60|$|As {{might have}} been expected, the young trooper {{attempted}} to spring up, and tried to use his weapon; but, finding this to be impossible at such close quarters, he dropped it, and grappled the farmer with all his might; but Andrew, holding <b>on</b> to <b>him</b> <b>like</b> a vice, placed his knee upon his chest and held him firmly down.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ay, he will, when {{somebody}} makes {{up their mind}} to drop it <b>on</b> <b>him.</b> I should <b>like</b> to see <b>him</b> taken down a peg or two, shouldn't you?' ...|$|R
60|$|Alas! {{though it}} was indeed thus drawn in, his armour was hanging <b>on</b> <b>him</b> <b>like</b> the shell of a last year's nut. They {{released}} him from it, and he lay against the cushions with short painful respiration, and frequent cough.|$|E
60|$|But it {{was time}} to catch the last ferry-boat for Oakland, and Brissenden and Martin slipped out, leaving Norton still talking and Kreis and Hamilton waiting to pounce <b>on</b> <b>him</b> <b>like</b> a pair of hounds as soon as he finished.|$|E
60|$|Ashe, {{not being}} {{miraculously}} intuitive, accepted the easier explanation that she smiled {{because she was}} glad to be in his company; and this thought, coming on top of his mood of despair and general dissatisfaction with everything mundane, acted <b>on</b> <b>him</b> <b>like</b> some powerful chemical.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Ah! my lady--my dear lady! I was on {{the turn}} of the stairs, and saw all. The traitor--the Chevalier Narcisse--came <b>on</b> <b>him,</b> cloaked <b>like</b> you--and--shot <b>him</b> dead--with, oh, such cruel words of mockery! Oh! woe the day! Stay, stay, dear lady, the place is all blood--they are slaying them all--all the Huguenots! Will no one stop her?--Mademoiselle--ma'm'selle!--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That's it! He had eluded pursuit, and {{was going}} to America in a flaxen wig, and whiskers, and such a {{complete}} disguise as never you see in all your born days; when the little woman, being in Southampton, met him walking along the street--picked him out with her sharp eye in a moment--ran betwixt his legs to upset him--and held <b>on</b> to <b>him</b> <b>like</b> grim Death.' ...|$|R

60|$|Armand, who was {{watching}} his sister very closely, saw that she started {{at the sight of}} the wretch, and seemed immediately to shrink still further within herself, whilst her eyes, suddenly luminous and dilated, rested <b>on</b> <b>him</b> <b>like</b> those of a captive bird upon an approaching cobra.|$|E
60|$|So {{far from}} that, I {{had no doubt}} of her being {{prepared}} {{to have a great}} reliance <b>on</b> <b>him</b> and to <b>like</b> <b>him</b> very much. I said that he was no stranger to her personally, for she had seen him often in his kind attendance on Miss Flite.|$|R

60|$|The {{meeting was}} a great {{pleasure}} to both the children, and resulted in an immediate friendship. The small girl at once conceived a great admiration for the big, strong boy nearly twice her age and more than twice her size. At her time of life the convenances are not, and love is a thing to be spoken out at once and in the open. Mrs. Jarrold, from the moment she set eyes <b>on</b> <b>him,</b> <b>liked</b> the big kindly-faced boy who treated her like a lady, and who stood awkwardly blushing and silent {{in the middle of the}} nursery listening to the tiny child's proffers of affection. For whatever kind of love it is that boys are capable of, Harold had fallen into it. 'Calf-love' is a thing habitually treated with contempt. It may be ridiculous; but all the same it is a serious reality--to the calf.|$|R
