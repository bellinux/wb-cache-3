50|$|Aspidiotus nerii is {{a species}} of armored scale insect with the common names <b>Oleander</b> <b>scale</b> and ivy scale.|$|E
40|$|Many {{armoured}} scale (Hemiptera: Diaspididae) are polyphagous and {{the various}} plants growing near orchards are potential hosts for scale which can invade adjacent kiwifruit, Actinidia deliciosa, vines. Scale insects were collected from sprayed and unsprayed vines, scale-free potted kiwifruit plants which were placed in orchards, infested kiwifruit from 3 packhouses and from alternative host plants adjacent to kiwifruit vines. A total of 2661 specimens from 7 districts were identified. Greedy scale, Hemiberlesia rapax (Comstock), was the most widespread species on kiwifruit, followed by <b>oleander</b> <b>scale,</b> Aspidiotus nerii Boucht and latania scale, Hemiberlesia lataniae (Signoret). The same species was usually dominant on both kiwifruit vines and adjacent alternative host plants...|$|E
40|$|The sex {{pheromone}} {{emitted by}} the female <b>oleander</b> <b>scale,</b> Aspidiotus nerii (Homoptera, Diaspididae), has been isolated and characterized as (1 R, 2 S) -cis- 2 -isopropenyl- 1 -(4 ′-methyl- 4 ′-penten- 1 ′-yl) cyclobutaneethanol acetate by using advanced MS and NMR spectroscopic methods, {{as well as}} a variety of microderivatization sequences. The structure has been confirmed by stereo- and enantioselective synthesis of the four possible stereoisomers. The absolute configuration has been determined by comparison of the activity of the cis (1 S, 2 R) and (1 R, 2 S) enantiomers with that exhibited by the natural material in greenhouse bioassays and field tests. The structure of this sesquiterpenoid pheromone is new in the coccids and in the pheromone field in general...|$|E
40|$|Guilds of {{herbivore}} insects of medicinal and {{aromatic plants}} are generally composed by poliphagous insects that only occasionally are present at high infestation levels. In this paper the main insect pests observed on Capper spinosa (L.) in Sicily are described. The key pests of this crop are Capparimyia savastani (Martelli) – (Diptera: Tephritidae), Asphondylia gennadii (Marchal) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), and, the painted bug Bagrada hilaris (Burmeister) (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae). Infestations of other insect pests are also occasionally recorded {{as the case}} of the southern green stink bug, Nezara viridula (L.) (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae), in the island of Ustica; the cabbage butterfly, Pieris brassicae L. (Lepidoptera: Pieridae), in the island of Salina; the <b>oleander</b> <b>scale,</b> Aspidiotus nerii Bouchè (Homoptera: Dispididae), and the citrus mealybug, Planococcus citri Risso (Homoptera: Pseudococcidae) in the island of Pantelleria. Notes on distribution, biology and damages of these herbivore insects are given, and the possible strategies for their control are briefly discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{role of the}} {{synthetic}} sex pheromone of the <b>Oleander</b> <b>Scale,</b> Aspidiotus nerii Bouché (Homoptera: Diaspididae), in the long-range host-searching behaviour of the specialist parasitoid Aphytis chilensis Howard (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) was studied. Different concen-trations in hexane of the (-) and (+) enantiomers of he synthetic host sex-pheromone were com-pared for their attractiveness in dual choice tests in an Y-olfactometer. Wasp females were signifi-cantly attracted from {{the synthetic}} sex pheromone at the concentrations from 3 x 10 - 4 up to 6 x 10 - 3 (g / l) of the (+) enantiomer, and at a concentration of 3 x 10 - 3 (g / l) of the (-) enantiomer. At the concentrations less than 6 x 10 - 5 (g / l), for the (-) enantiomer, or less than 3 x 10 - 4 (g / l) for (+) enantiomer female wasps did not show preferences. These results indicate that in searching behaviour of A. nerii A. chilensis is orientated towards areas likely to contain suitable host stages by host-derived information...|$|E
