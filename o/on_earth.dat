5|$|Due to {{the harsh}} {{conditions}} on the surface, little of the planet has been explored; {{in addition to the}} fact that life as currently understood may not necessarily be the same {{in other parts of the}} universe, the extent of the tenacity of life <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> itself has not yet been shown. Creatures known as extremophiles exist <b>on</b> <b>Earth,</b> preferring extreme habitats. Thermophiles and hyperthermophiles thrive at temperatures reaching above the boiling point of water, acidophiles thrive at a pH level of 3 or below, polyextremophiles can survive a varied number of extreme conditions, and many other types of extremophiles exist <b>on</b> <b>Earth.</b>|$|E
5|$|During {{early studies}} of the optical {{spectrum}} of the photosphere, some absorption lines were found that did not correspond to any chemical elements then known <b>on</b> <b>Earth.</b> In 1868, Norman Lockyer hypothesized that these absorption lines were caused by a new element that he dubbed helium, after the Greek Sun god Helios. Twenty-five years later, helium was isolated <b>on</b> <b>Earth.</b>|$|E

5|$|Despite 17th Street Productions {{holding the}} rights to The Last Dog <b>on</b> <b>Earth,</b> Dell Publishing gained {{permission}} to publish it. The company released the novel in hardcover in 2003 and in paperback in 2004.

The Last Dog <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> was a winner of the Texas Lone Star Reading List and recognized by YALSA on a 2006 book list for young adults. The novel garnered mixed feedback from critics, who generally felt that the plot held appeal, but that Ehrenhaft tended to rely on coincidence.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{atmosphere}} is very effective at absorbing high energy electromagnetic radiation such as x-rays and gamma rays, so {{these types of}} radiation would not reach any dangerous levels at the surface during the burst event itself. The immediate effect on life <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> from a GRB within a few parsecs would only be a short increase in ultraviolet radiation at ground level, lasting from {{less than a second}} to tens of seconds. This ultraviolet radiation could potentially reach dangerous levels depending on the exact nature and distance of the burst, but it seems unlikely to be able to cause a global catastrophe for life <b>on</b> <b>Earth.</b>|$|E
