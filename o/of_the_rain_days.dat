5000|$|Sotdae birds may be wild geese, gulls, ibises, Korean magpies or crows, {{but most}} {{commonly}} they are ducks. Ducks give an important symbolic meaning to sotdae. They {{are able to}} travel on water {{as well as on}} land and in the air and also can go under water. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relation to water, ducks were regarded to have an ability to control rain and thunder, to survive in the floods and to protect a village from fire. This belief made people think of ducks as a guardian in ancient agricultural societies. Relating to this, a famous scholar, Lee Gyubo (이규보, 李奎報 1168-1241) wrote a following phrase in his garland called Dongguk I sangguk jip (동국이상국집, 東國李相國集: Collected works of Minister Yi of Korea): [...] "Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> for 7 <b>days</b> in a row, <b>the</b> capital <b>of</b> Songyang was submerged. The king, Jumong, was riding a duck horse stretching a reed rope across the river and his people were all holding that rope." [...] This suggests that people considered a duck as a rescuer from flood.|$|R
40|$|Rainfall data {{collected}} on {{and around the}} Soufriere Hills Volcano, Montserrat, between 1998 and 2003 were analysed {{to assess the impact}} on primary volcanic activity, defined here as pyroclastic flows, dome collapses, and explosions. Fifteen such rainfall-triggered events were identified. If greater than 20 mm of rain fell on a particular day, <b>the</b> probability <b>of</b> a dome collapse occurring on that day increased by a factor of 6. 3 to 9. 2 %, compared to a randomly chosen day. Similarly, <b>the</b> probability <b>of</b> observing pyroclastic flows and explosions on a day with > 20 mm of rainfall increased by factors of 2. 6 and 5. 4, respectively. These statistically significant links increased as the rainfall threshold was increased. Seventy percent of these rainfall-induced dome collapse episodes occurred on the same calendar day (most within a few hours) as <b>the</b> onset <b>of</b> intense rainfall, but an extra 3 occurred one or two calendar days later. <b>The</b> state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> volcano was important, with the rainfall-volcanic activity link being strongest during periods of unstable dome growth and weakest during periods of no dome growth or after a recent major collapse. Over 50 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heavy <b>rain</b> <b>days</b> were associated with large-scale weather systems that can potentially be forecast up to a few days ahead. However, <b>the</b> remaining heavy <b>rain</b> <b>days</b> wer associated with small-scale, essentially unpredictable weather systems. There was significant variability in <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> rainfall recorded by different rain gauges, reflecting topographic variations around the volcano but also the inherent small-scale variability within an individual weather system. Hence, any monitoring/warning program is recommended to use a network, rather than just a single gauge. The seasonal cycle in rainfall was pronounced, with nearly all <b>the</b> heavy <b>rain</b> <b>days</b> occurring in <b>the</b> May-December wet season. Hence, the dome was at its most vulnerable at <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wet season after a period of uninterrupted growth. Interannual variability in the rainfall was related to tropical Pacific and Atlantic sea surface temperature anomalies, and holds out <b>the</b> prospect <b>of</b> some limited skill in volcanic hazard forecasts at even longer lead times...|$|R

Data from 1970 to 1974 were applied for sensitivity analyses and autocalibration and subsequently validate hindcasts over the period 1976 - 1986. Despite there being only slight differences in mean annual precipitation (1003 mm vs. 1052 mm) between STN and CRU, the data differ more in their estimates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>rain</b> <b>days</b> (136 vs. 112) and wet days standard deviation (11. 75 mm vs. 18. 49 mm).

40|$|Extreme {{rainfall}} and tropical cyclones (TCs) are {{of great interest}} to the meteorological community. Their influences extend to many different industries such as agriculture, airlines and insurance, and they keep challenging forecasters in making their decisions. A great deal of effort has been put into improving our understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extreme {{rainfall and}} tropical cyclone genesis, as well as increasing the forecast accuracy in the numerical weather prediction models and operational forecast systems. The research presented here examines extreme rain events and tropical cyclone genesis from a potettial vorticity (PV) viewpoint using mainly European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA-Interim (ERAI) reanalysis. PV is used as a diagnostic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> atmospheric flow in this research and the main meteorological field to investigate the synoptic conditions during extreme <b>rain</b> events and <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> tropical cyclones. <b>The</b> objective tracking technique introduced by Berry et al. (2012) is used to track cyclonic PV centres on three isentropic surfaces (315 K, 330 K, and 350 K) and construct a global climatology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coherent cyclonic PV centres density and motion. It is found that the coherent cyclonic PV centres lie predominantly on the equatorward flank and commonly travel around <b>the</b> periphery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mean subtropical anticyclones. This motion implies <b>the</b> transport <b>of</b> cyclonic PV centres from the midlatitudes to the tropics on <b>the</b> eastern side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anticyclones. One area in which <b>the</b> meridional transport <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PV from the extratropics toward the tropics is large is <b>the</b> east coast <b>of</b> Australia during December-January-February (DJF). Extreme rainfall is defined by the 95 th percentile <b>of</b> <b>the</b> daily rainfall time series for particular season from 1997 to 2009 from Global Precipitation Climate Project (GPCP). It is shown that 95 % and 82 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extreme <b>rain</b> <b>days</b> in <b>the</b> Australian and north African tropics, respectively, are associated with a cyclonic PV centre. The composites based on extreme <b>rain</b> <b>days</b> in <b>the</b> two regions also show a coherent cyclonic PV centre upstream <b>of</b> <b>the</b> precipitating region. The vertical structures are broadly the same, although the amplitude is a little larger in the Australian tropics. The vertical wind structures reveal that the synoptic pattern in the Australian tropics is similar to a mesoscale convective system (MCS), whereas in the north African tropics it is closer to an easterly wave. It is also shown that after extreme <b>rain</b> events in <b>the</b> Australian tropics, the large-scale circulation dramatically changes with the positive rainfall anomaly regions and the monsoon trough moving far southward, and with rainfall over west Australia and monsoon trough frequency in the extratropics increasing significantly. Tropical cyclones are usually associated with coherent cyclonic PV centres in the lower and mid-troposphere. It is found that there are approximately 3 - 4 TCs per year in North Atlantic which have associated coherent cyclonic PV centres originating in the extratropics (i. e. poleward of 23. 5 ◦), whereas in South Pacific, approximately 10 TCs are found over 30 years (1980 - 2009) with associated coherent cyclonic PV centres originating in the extratropics. Tropical cyclone Larry (March 2006) formed in the Coral Sea and was associated with a 330 K isentropic coherent cyclonic PV centre originating in the extratropics is investigated here. PV filamentation along <b>the</b> east coast <b>of</b> Australia plays a role in <b>the</b> generation <b>of</b> TC Larry, and Larry is the only TC in March-April-May season that has an associated coherent PV maximum detected first in the extratropics. It is also found that Rossby waves breaking (RWB) characterised by an elongated upper-level PV trough over the Coral Sea intensifies a tropical disturbance into a tropical depression before a second RWB event associated with a cold surge, combines with small vertical wind shear, to intensify the low-level vorticity eventually forming TC Larry...|$|R

Using {{a network of}} 34 stations, inter-station correlations (1958 - 1987) are computed for each <b>of</b> these variables. <b>The</b> spatial coherence <b>of</b> monthly or seasonal P and NRD is always much {{higher than that of}} rainfall intensity.
