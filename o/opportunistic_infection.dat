5|$|AIDS {{was first}} {{clinically}} observed in 1981 in the United States. The initial cases were {{a cluster of}} injection drug users and gay men with no known cause of impaired immunity who showed symptoms of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), a rare <b>opportunistic</b> <b>infection</b> that was known to occur in people with very compromised immune systems. Soon thereafter, additional gay men developed a previously rare skin cancer called Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Many more cases of PCP and KS emerged, alerting U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a CDC task force was formed to monitor the outbreak.

25|$|Bone marrow {{transplantation}} {{usually requires}} that the recipient's own bone marrow be destroyed (myeloablation). Prior to the administration of new cells (engraftment) patients may go for several weeks without appreciable numbers of white blood cells to help fight infection. This puts a patient {{at high risk of}} infections, sepsis and septic shock, despite prophylactic antibiotics. However, antiviral medications, such as acyclovir and valacyclovir, are quite effective in prevention of HSCT-related outbreak of herpetic infection in seropositive patients. The immunosuppressive agents employed in allogeneic transplants for the prevention or treatment of graft-versus-host disease further increase the risk of <b>opportunistic</b> <b>infection.</b> Immunosuppressive drugs are given for a minimum of 6-months after a transplantation, or much longer if required for the treatment of graft-versus-host disease. Transplant patients lose their acquired immunity, for example immunity to childhood diseases such as measles or polio. For this reason transplant patients must be re-vaccinated with childhood vaccines once they are off immunosuppressive medications.|$|E

500|$|Soon {{after its}} {{approval}} natalizumab was {{withdrawn from the}} market by its manufacturer after it was linked with three cases of the rare but hazardous neurological condition called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is an <b>opportunistic</b> <b>infection</b> with neurological progressive symptoms caused by the replication of the JC virus in the glial cells of the brain. All 3 initial cases were taking natalizumab in combination with interferon beta-1a. After a safety review the drug was returned to the market in 2006 as a monotherapy for MS under a special prescription program. As of May 2011, over 130 cases of PML had been reported, all [...] in patients who had taken natalizumab {{for more than a}} year. While none of them had taken the drug in combination with other disease-modifying treatments, previous use of MS treatments increases the risk of PML between 3 and 4-fold. The estimated prevalence of PML is 1.5 cases per thousand natalizumab users. Around 20% of MS patients with PML die, while most of the remaining are importantly disabled.|$|E

40|$|In {{an era of}} {{increasing}} use of immunomodulator (IM) therapy, <b>opportunistic</b> <b>infections</b> have emerged as a pivotal safety issue in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Today's challenge to the physician {{is not only to}} manage IBD, but also to recognise, prevent and treat common and uncommon infections. The recent European ECCO guidelines on the management and prevention of <b>opportunistic</b> <b>infections</b> in patients with IBD provide clinicians with guidance on the prevention, detection and management of <b>opportunistic</b> <b>infections</b> in patients with IBD. Proposals may appear radical, potentially changing current practice, but we believe that the recommendations will help optimise patient outcomes by reducing morbidity and mortality related to <b>opportunistic</b> <b>infections</b> in patients with IBD. In this ongoing process, prevention is far the first and most important step. Prevention of <b>opportunistic</b> <b>infections</b> relies on recognition of risk factors for infection, the use of primary or secondary chemoprophylaxis, careful monitoring (clinical and laboratory work-up) before and during the use of immunomodulators, vaccination and education of the patient. Special recommendations should also be given to patients before travel. Additionally, this paper discusses how the ECCO guidelines can be implemented in Belgium according to reimbursement legislatio...|$|R
