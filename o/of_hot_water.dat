5|$|On 19 August 1800, when Anning was 15 months old, {{an event}} {{occurred}} that {{became part of}} local lore. She was being held by a neighbour, Elizabeth Haskings, who was standing with two other women under an elm tree watching an equestrian show being put on by a travelling company of horsemen, when lightning struck the tree killing all three women below. Onlookers rushed the infant home where she was revived in a bath <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> <b>water.</b> A local doctor declared her survival miraculous. Her family {{said she had been}} a sickly baby before the event but afterwards she seemed to blossom. For years afterward members of her community would attribute the child's curiosity, intelligence and lively personality to the incident.|$|E

40|$|Transactions of AIJ. Journal of {{environmental}} engineeringIn {{order to the}} evaluate heat loss from <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> supply lines in a residential building, <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> demand {{in a house in}} Chiba prefecture was measured and analyzed. The following results were obtained. 1. The heat loss <b>of</b> the <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> supply line was about 132 kJ for the shower and 110 kJ for the bathtub in winter. Since the temperature difference between the inlet and outlet <b>of</b> the <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> supply line is small, the measured heat loss from the <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> supply line sometimes becomes negative. 2. In order to estimate the heat loss under various conditions, a thermal model was proposed. 3. The calculated daily heat loss <b>of</b> the <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> supply line was 122 kJ for the shower and 689 kJ for the bathtub in winter. The average daily heat loss from the <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> supply line during use and after use was 1774. 7 KJ in winter. This heat loss amounts to 4. 7 % of the total daily energy use for <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> supply. 4.

25|$|Accordingly, an {{arbitrary}} volume <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> can be stored, {{as long as}} the stratification is kept intact. In this case there must not be vertical metal plates or tubes as they would conduct heat through the water layers, defeating the purpose of stratification. When effectively employed this technique can maintain water as high as 95°C (i.e. just below boiling) yielding a higher energy density, and this energy can be stored a long time provided the hot water remains undiluted.|$|E
