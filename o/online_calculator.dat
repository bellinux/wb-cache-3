2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 2011, colleges were {{required}} by federal law to post a net price calculator on their websites to give prospective students and families a rough estimate of likely college costs for their particular institution, and to [...] "demystify pricing." [...] A student or family could go <b>online,</b> find the <b>calculator</b> at a college's website, and enter the required financial and academic information, and the calculator should tell them {{an estimate of the}} likely cost of attending that college. The first <b>online</b> <b>calculators</b> were started by Williams College. The <b>online</b> <b>calculators</b> look at financial need and academic merit to try to estimate the likely discounted price offered to a particular student from a particular college, using information including details from tax returns, household income, grade point averages and test scores. Schools vary in terms of their pricing formulas; some consider home equity as a factor while others disregard it. Lynn O'Shaughnessy recommends that families shopping for colleges go to a college's website and use the net price calculator to get a personalized estimate of cost.|$|R

50|$|Czech seed beads {{are sold}} from the {{factories}} by boxes, bags or strands. They are often repackaged into hanks, tubes, or other containers for retail sale, in quantities varying from 5 grams to 40 or more grams. When Czech beads are repackaged, {{they are usually}} sold by the gram, which creates some confusion on how many beads come on a hank. Not every 20 inch strand of size 11° beads weighs the same. However, there are some <b>online</b> <b>calculators,</b> {{which can be used}} for conversion from hanks to grams and from grams to hanks.|$|R
40|$|The {{choice of}} {{adequate}} {{number of subjects}} that would ensure accurate estimates {{is an important one}} in a clinical trial setting. Although complexity of a formula increases with complexity in study design, the basic structure of a sample size calculation formula is very simple. This paper attempts to review the basic requirements for computation of the magic number required to estimate unknown target population quantities and to test treatment differences for continuous as well as binary outcomes. Concepts are demonstrated through simple examples.   Using <b>online</b> <b>calculators</b> for sample size is also discussed...|$|R
