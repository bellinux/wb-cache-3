40|$|Resin Transfer Molding (RTM), as {{a method}} for the {{manufacture}} of advanced fiber reinforced composite materials, is attractive because it offers the possibility of lower manufacturing costs and more complex shapes than traditional methods. A major issue in this new manufacturing process is the elimination of void spaces in the resin fill operation, so that products with high quality are manufactured. Process modeling is particularly useful in understanding, designing, and optimizing the process conditions to achieve this goal. In this paper we report <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>program</b> with the Advanced Technology & Development Center at Northrop Grumman and demonstrate how modeling could improve the manufacturing process and enhance product quality.

40|$|An {{course on}} {{object-oriented}} (OO) {{design in the}} first academic year includes basic design principles that students learn {{at the same time}} than OO programming. Following, when they are faced with their first design problems, they do not have enough programming experience to forget low-level problems and reach a higher level of abstraction. Students learn the desired characteristics of an OO design in their lectures, but they lack of a starting point in order to apply them. Therefore, how do they learn to create and evaluate designs and how do we get across our experience?

30|$|Before we embark <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>program,</b> let us {{note that}} in spite of the close {{resemblance}} between maps sampled from monochromatic Gaussian fields and real mature maps, there are notable differences. As we remarked above, real correlation spectra are not infinitely thin, and the precise measurements by Schnabel make it possible to give quantitative arguments for the difference between an invariant Gaussian field with the measured spectrum (see for instance a discussion in [34]). In the successful long-range interaction model of Wolf, Geisel, Kaschube and coworkers, Gaussian fields {{turn out to be a}} better description of the initial stage of cortical map development than they are of the mature stage. We have two reasons for sticking to Gaussian fields in this paper: the first is that they are ideally suited to discussing and generalizing the concepts crucial to producing realistic maps, and the second is that a non-Euclidean version of the long-range interaction model can easily be written down in the upcoming Discussion.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} the cost {{effectiveness of a}} universal prenatal screening program for α- and β-thalassaemia. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed our program from 1998 to 2002, and calculated the direct and indirect costs of various components. Results 18 936 women were screened at our prenatal clinic and 153 couples were subsequently referred to our Prenatal Diagnostic Centre for counselling and further investigations. In addition, there were 238 tertiary referrals and 157 self-referrals. After investigations, 84 fetuses were at risk of β-thalassaemia major/β-E thalassaemia, 19 of them were affected and 18 were aborted. The total expenditure <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>program</b> (HK$ 10. 0 million) would be less than the postnatal service costs (HK$ 40. 4 million) for 18 β-thalassaemia major fetuses if they were born. Of 361 women at risk of carrying a homozygous α 0 -thalassaemia fetus, 311 (86. 2 %) opted for the indirect approach (using serial ultrasound examinations to exclude Hb Bart's disease), and 76 (24. 5 %) subsequently underwent an invasive test for a definitive diagnosis. The sensitivity and false positive rate of this indirect approach was 100. 0 % and 2. 9 % respectively. Conclusion It is cost effective to run a universal prenatal screening program {{in an area where}} both thalassaemia and α-thalassaemia are prevalent. The indirect approach can effectively avoid an invasive test in unaffected pregnancies. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

In the first paper {{the results of a}} CCD photometric campaign conducted at ESO (La Silla, Chile) on 6 - 14 July 1998, for a total time on the source of ~ 30 hours. Some peculiarities in the light and colour cutves were evidenced. In the second paper we report on linear polarization, as observed in the UBVRI bands in June and August 1998 for a total of ~ 45 hours. Between the two epochs, the linear polarization in the V band increased from ~ 3. 5 % to ~ 5. 5 %, and the position angle decreased from 100 deg to 70 deg. Significant day-to-day variations of both quantities are also observed. An isolated "dip" of the polarization percentage occurred between 17 and 19 June in all bands: a decrease and subsequent rise of a factor of 2 is seen in the linear polarization, accompanied by a variation of the position angle by 90 deg.

40|$|It {{has been}} five years since the Carnegie Report Educating Lawyers called upon law schools to adopt an {{integrated}} approach to professional education that teaches practical skills and professionalism across the curriculum. Yet so far, very few schools have responded to this clarion call for wholesale curricular reform. Considering the inertial effect of traditional law school pedagogy and the institutional impediments to change, this delay is not surprising. A fully integrated approach to teaching professional skills (such as the medical school model) would require major resource reallocations, realignment of teaching responsibilities, redesign of courses, and changes to graduation requirements. While I fully support such comprehensive reform, the pragmatist in me knows {{that it will take}} years to accomplish. My goal in this essay is to offer a “self-help” remedy for faculty members and administrators interested in responding to the Carnegie Report’s call for a greater emphasis on experiential education, but uninterested in waiting for the committee deliberations, reports, faculty votes, and tough resource trade-offs that lie ahead. We drag our heels at our own peril and to the serious disadvantage of our current students.
