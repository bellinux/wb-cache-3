5|$|At the German Embassy in Washington, D.C., on January 2, 1873, Savage {{married the}} aristocratic Anna Josephine Scheible, a German widow three years <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> {{who had arrived}} in war-torn America in 1864 with her first husband, Gustav, to look after family-owned land in Georgia. Gustav Scheible died in 1866 and Anna became a {{favorite}} of the Washington social circle. Her marriage to Savage produced one daughter, who later married Anatol de Carriere, a minor nobleman and an Imperial Russian Councilor of State.|$|E
5|$|Plante's {{first foray}} into {{organized}} hockey came at age 12. He was watching his school's team practice, when the coach ordered the goaltender off the ice after a heated argument over his play, and Plante asked to replace him. The coach permitted him to play {{since there was no}} other available goaltender; it was quickly apparent that Plante could hold his own, despite the other players being many years <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> was. He impressed the coach and stayed on as the team's number one goaltender.|$|E
5|$|Born on July 18, 1913, in Vincennes, Indiana, Richard Skelton was {{the fourth}} and {{youngest}} son of Ida Mae (née Fields) and Joseph Elmer Skelton. Joseph, a grocer, died two months before Richard was born; {{he had once been}} a clown with the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus. During Skelton's lifetime there was some dispute about the year of his birth. Author Wesley Hyatt suggests that since he began working at such an early age, Skelton may have claimed he was <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> actually was in order to gain employment. Vincennes neighbors described the Skelton family as being extremely poor; a childhood friend remembered that her parents broke up a youthful romance between her sister and Skelton because they thought he had no future.|$|E

5|$|Constantine {{was one of}} the {{youngest}} sons of Romanos I and his wife Theodora. Theophanes Continuatus mentions him as {{the youngest}} son of the imperial couple, while the 11th-century chronicler George Kedrenos mentions him as the third of four known sons. His older brothers were Christopher Lekapenos (co-emperor 921–931) and Stephen Lekapenos (co-emperor 924-945). It is unclear if Theophylact (Patriarch of Constantinople in 933–956) was his younger brother or slightly <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> was. His sisters included Helena, who married Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos (r. 913–959), and Agatha, who married Romanos Argyros. He probably also had at least two unnamed sisters, known only because of their marriages to the magistroi Romanos Mosele and Romanos Saronites.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo was a {{contemporary}} of Botticelli, Domenico Ghirlandaio and Perugino, {{who were all}} slightly <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> was. He would have met them at the workshop of Verrocchio, with whom they had associations, and at the Academy of the Medici. Botticelli was a particular favourite of the Medici family, and thus his success as a painter was assured. Ghirlandaio and Perugino were both prolific and ran large workshops. They competently delivered commissions to well-satisfied patrons who appreciated Ghirlandaio's ability to portray the wealthy citizens of Florence within large religious frescoes, and Perugino's ability to deliver a multitude of saints and angels of unfailing sweetness and innocence.|$|E
5|$|The story {{opens on}} Monday April 14, 2003 at the {{beginning}} of the school year, when Tomoya meets Nagisa Furukawa, a soft-spoken girl who is one year <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> is but is repeating her last year in high school due to being sick much of the previous year. Her goal is to join the drama club which she was unable to do due to her sickness, but they find that the drama club was disbanded after the few remaining members graduated. Since Tomoya has a lot of time to kill, he helps Nagisa in reforming the drama club. During this period, Tomoya meets and hangs out with several other girls whom he gets to know well and help with their individual problems.|$|E

5|$|Harding {{first came}} to know Florence Kling, five years <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>he,</b> as the {{daughter}} of a local banker and developer. Amos Kling was a man accustomed to getting his way, but Harding attacked him relentlessly in the paper. Amos involved Florence in all his affairs, taking her to work from the time she could walk. As hard-headed as her father, Florence came into conflict with him after returning from music college. After she eloped with Pete deWolfe, and returned to Marion without deWolfe, but with an infant called Marshall, Amos agreed to raise the boy, but would not support Florence, who made a living as a piano teacher. One of her students was Harding's sister Charity. By 1886, Florence Kling had obtained a divorce, and she and Warren Harding were courting, though who was pursuing whom is uncertain, depending on who later told the story of their romance.|$|E
5|$|The {{governing}} Liberals repeatedly {{attempted to}} deprive Diefenbaker of his parliamentary seat. In 1948, Lake Centre was redistricted to remove areas which strongly supported Diefenbaker. In spite of that, he was returned in the 1949 election, the only PC member from Saskatchewan. In 1952, a redistricting committee dominated by Liberals abolished Lake Centre entirely, dividing its voters among three other ridings. Diefenbaker stated {{in his memoirs}} that he had considered retiring from the House; with Drew only a year <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> was, the Westerner saw little prospect of advancement, and had received tempting offers from Ontario law firms. However, the gerrymandering so angered him {{that he decided to}} fight for a seat. Diefenbaker's party had taken Prince Albert only once, in 1911, but he decided to stand in that riding for the 1953 election, and was successful. He would hold that seat {{for the rest of his}} life. Even though Diefenbaker campaigned nationally for party candidates, the Progressive Conservatives gained little, rising to 51 seats as St. Laurent led the Liberals to a fifth successive majority. In addition to trying to secure his departure from Parliament, the government opened a home for unwed Indian mothers next door to Diefenbaker's home in Prince Albert.|$|E
5|$|The {{engagement}} {{was declared}} on 5 December 1865, {{and despite the}} Prince of Wales's initial refusal to attend, Princess Alice intervened, and the wedding was a happy occasion. The Queen allowed the ceremony to take place at Windsor Castle, albeit in the Private Chapel rather than the grander St George's Chapel on 5 July 1866. The Queen relieved her black mourning dress with a white mourning cap which draped over her back. The main participants filed into the chapel {{to the sound of}} Beethoven's , creating a spectacle only marred by the sudden disappearance of Prince George, the Duke of Cambridge, who had a sudden gout attack. Christian filed into the chapel with his two supporters, Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar and Prince Frederic of Schleswig-Holstein, and Helena was given away by her mother, who escorted her up the aisle with the Prince of Wales and eight bridesmaids. Christian looked <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> was, and one guest commented that Helena looked as if she was marrying an aged uncle. Indeed, when he was first summoned to Britain, he assumed that the widowed Queen was inspecting him as a new husband for herself rather than as a candidate for one of her daughters. The couple spent the first night of their married life at Osborne House, before honeymooning in Paris, Interlaken and Genoa.|$|E

5000|$|Lastly, his {{supposed}} date {{of birth}} varies between sources, however, a likely date has now been calculated. It is known for certain that in 415 Saint Augustine referred to Paulus Orosius as [...] "a young priest", which means that at that time {{he could not have}} been <b>older</b> <b>than</b> 40, as <b>he</b> was young, and he had to be <b>older</b> <b>than</b> 30, as <b>he</b> was a priest.|$|R

25|$|According to Winkler's {{commentary}} on the DVD release of the film, he had considered numerous actresses {{for the role of}} Linda when Ashley Judd's agent advised him she was interested in the part.
