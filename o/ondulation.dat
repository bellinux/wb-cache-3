Many earth gravity models has been make on the last decades. Between them the most popular one until the present time is the EGM 96 whose resolution degree is 360. The most actual model is the EGM 2008 with a resolution degree of 2190. The evaluation of the EGM 2008 in Brazil {{is the purpose of}} this work. To do that we searched for the control points in the brazilian territory with orthometric H and geometric h (ellipsoidal) information and geodetic coordinates. We had used 346 points on which we had determined real geoidal <b>ondulation</b> value (&# 8710;Nreal = h - H).

The same procedure was done to the interpolator model MAPGEO 2004 which is extensively used in Brasil. The geoidal <b>ondulation</b> absolute mean error from EGM 2008 is 35 cm which is 69 % better than that ones from MAPGEO 2004. That significant accuracy improve will result a gain for that purposes.

Also, the urban network can be characterized as a sensually stimulated environment where the richness of the colors and the differences of the light and dark areas were the daily experience of the town citizens. Additional, Akrotiri impresses the visitor by the great number of squares and crossroads.

A number of toxicological parameters in kidney were examined including malondialdehyde (MDA) and endogenous antioxidants, e. g., catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx). The parameters that indicate tissue damage such as serum urea and creatinine were also determined, along with the ultrastructural changes of kidneys. A correlation was found between the dose and the intensity of changes. The results demonstrated that cadmium administration increased renal MDA but decreased CAT, SOD and GPx activities. In parallel, serum creatinine and urea elevated. The glomerular ultrastructural changes observed in cadmium-treated rats included narrowing of the capillary lumen and swelling of the capillary endothelium with occasional loss of fenestrae.

40|$|At Somplago near Tolmezzo, two {{horizontal}} pendulums,reaching periods up to 20 minutes, are operanting (experimentally) in a 130 m high, excavated mountain pit; the pit {{is connected}} with the subterraneanpower plant house where, in a room, is installed an electromagneticseismic station. The sensibility of the pendulums to the variations of theapparent vertical is extreme. At present, their period is {{on the order of}} 5 minutes. In the first half of January 1969, in the region of the Ambiesta (aright-side confluent of the Tagliamento river, with which it unites nearTolmezzo) there occurred a small seismic period, characterized by two smallshocks, almost unnoticed by the local population; the first on the 7 th andthe second, stronger one, on the 14 th of January. After about 10 yearsof near immobility, at the end of November and along all of December,the clinographs functioning in the rocks, on the right of the Ambiesta atthe level of the dam barring te river, showed a perceptible, slow ondulationof the ground. This variation of the vertical can be put in relation withthe minor shock of January 7 th 1969, that was perceived by the personnel of the Ambiesta-dam and recorded by the local seismic station as well asby the seismic stations of Tolmezzo and of Somplago. This first shock isto be considered definitely superficial. The second shock occurred on January 14 th, in the region betweenthe Ambiesta-river and Somplago. Its depth has been estimated 011 theorder of 13 km. This shock was preceded by a very small displacementof pendulum " A " at Somplago on January 12 th, and then followed &mdash;several hours after the earthquake &mdash; by a perceivable deviation of thevertical, recorded by both pendulums " A " and " B ". The displacement(slightly above one second of arc) occurred more or less in direction ofthe source of the earthquake, with trend S 46 &deg; from Somplago. This isin accordance {{with the fact that the}} Somplago seisndc station recorded theearthquake as starting in the form of a compression (upward thrust). Themaximum displacement was reached in only a few hours, while it took about 20 days to bring the pendulums back to their primitive position. If &mdash;as everything seems to indicate &mdash; the displacement showed by the longperiodpendulums is to be related to the consequences provoked by the shockin his ipocentral location, it can be deduced that the propagation in directionSomplago of the recorded ondulating movement has been very slow (witha velocity inferior to 1 km/h). In other words, the displacement of mattersubsequent to the breack in the elastic field occurred in the liypocenter,lias taken on the form of an extremely slow <b>ondulation,</b> evidently associatedwith the gradual proceeding of the deformed stratification to a new systemof equilibrium. There have been other occasions, in the Tolmezzo area,permitting to detect a clear relation between slow variations of the verticaland local earthquakes. In the contemplated case at Somplago, the ondulationsfollowing the earthquake of 14. January have been definitely greaterthan the ones preceding the quake. In my opinion, it is with this course of action &mdash; geodynamic, geodetic,geomagnetic and geoelectric observations &mdash; that one can hope to gatherthe information apt to confer a more realistic character to the forecastingof seismic phenomena. To insist &mdash; as it is yet done in Italy &mdash; with thestatistical methods, is plainly illusory work. Max Planck spoke ironicallyof the pretense of some of his colleagues to resolve fundamental problemsof physics basing on the probability table. " Only the strictly dynamiclaws &mdash; the famous physicist pointed out &mdash; satisfy wholly our need ofknowledge, while no statistical law can actually satisfy, because it has noabsolute value but admits of exceptions in the single cases and thus leavesus confronting the problem to know which are the cases where such exceptionsmay occur ". " Therefore it appears convenient &mdash; it is still Planckspeaking &mdash; to claim among the postulates of physics not only the existenceof laws, but also their strictly causal character and to never consider closedthe investigation, until each and every statistic law is resolved into oneor more dynamic laws "...|$|E

Starting from Late Cretaceous to Lower Eocene the study area was part of the WSW – verging Dinaric foredeep-foreland system.

Starting from Middle Miocene the S-SSE verging Neogene- Quaternary Southalpine Chain started, giving rise to a low-angle, approximately WSW-ENE to WNW-ESE trending thrust-system. Neoalpine compression originated deformation of the Paleogene structural belt: i. e. strong <b>ondulations</b> of the hinges of the Dinaric folds and production of culminations and depressions of the first folds (dome-basin pattern).

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was the study by Nuclear Magnetic Relaxation of the {{molecular}} dynamics in liquid crystals of chiral molecules. These compounds are very interesting from both the scientific and the technological points of view. We have studied three different kinds of meso phases which are exhibited by several liquid crystal compounds: smectic - A phase (S_A), ferroelectric chiral smectic - C (S*_C) and helical chiral smectic - A or twist grain boundary smectic - A (TGB_A). The experimental results were proton spin-lattice relaxation times (T_ 1) and NMR spectra {{as a function of}} the frequency, the temperature and the rotation angle of the sample in the magnetic field. These results were used to characterize the molecular dynamics in the different meso phases. In order to cover a large frequency range for all the compounds studied, we have used four different NMR spectrometers. Three of them are conventional (one is field variable, working between 4 and 100 MHz for the proton and the other two are fixed field, working at 300 MHz) and the fourth is a fast field cycling spectrometer, working between 100 Hz and 4 MHz. In the S_A and S*_C phases the layer <b>ondulations</b> are the main relaxation mechanism for resonant frequencies less than about 10 to 20 kHz. In the TGB_A phase the molecular self-diffusion through the grain boundaries is also important in this frequency range. The molecular self-diffusion is the main relaxation mechanism between 20 kHz, approximately, for all the meso phases and all the temperatures studied.

Sometimes that proposed lithostratigraphy was questioned, but we do knownow that these arguments were based up incomplete or inadvertent field observations. At the sheet of Mirangaba, centralnorthernpart of Bahia, both the angular and erosional unconformity between the above-mentioned groups are exposed of aconspicuous way, according to their three dimensions, what deserves the special mention here consigned. The quartzites andconglomerates of the Chapada Diamantina group are cropping out as folded and re-fold rock units (general strike ENE-WSW) and they present features of intense superposed erosional processes. Two paleosurfaces were formed and are being exhibited,with complementary features of erosional scarpments, as well as amphitheatres, suppression of some lithostratigraphic units,testimonies-hills (quartzitic islands), etc. The lower pediplan then formed (today with summits ≥ 500 m) was completelycovered by the limestones (Salitre Fm.), where calcilutites are predominating, presenting many algalic edifications. We {{are not able to}} affirm that the proterozoic limestone progradation have covered the higher pediplan (today with summits ca. 1, 000 m), but there aresome testimonies-hills of limestone presenting tops up to 600 m, clearly above the present and predominating surface (Neogene, VelhasSurface), so reiterating that an intense erosional dissecation has occurred (Cenozoic in age) of the limestones. These limestones presentmonotonous subhorizontal structural attitudes, with the presence of some open folding (<b>ondulations)</b> when they are near of the contactswith the subjacent quartzites. Quite often these limestones were submitted to local ruptural displacements. The polyphasic deformationof the subjacent Chapada Diamantina group is being hypothetically attributed to the Brazilian cycle (as foreland domain of the Riacho doPontal fold system), but this proposed condition needs to be better constrained, as well as the northern limit of the São Francisco Craton(to the north) demands to be reviewed. The basal diamictites of the Bambuí Group (Bebedouro Fm.) is only locally cropping out, at thesouthern and at the northwestern part of the area.

40|$|International audienceIt is now {{generally}} accepted that Pentecost {{is in fact}} the theme of the tympanum of the central portal of the nave of the church at Vézelay - Pentecost, an event which was then regarded, as it still is, as the founding act of the Church. Representations of Apostles are seen at various points on the portal, indicating that the Church is already at work, teaching and preaching. In order to evoke the nature of the Church, the creator of the concept for the portal appears to have drawn on the two final chapters of the Apocalypse (21 and 22) and the relevant exegesis. For a characteristic feature of these texts is that pratically ail the component elements of the portal are therein alluded to, either directly or more or less implicitly. And it is from this source that certain of those elements derive their meaning, namely the waters at the feet of Christ; the throne on which he sits; the figures carved on the embrasure and the representation of John the Baptist; and especially the zodiac with its four insets as well as the two capitals on the right-hand side. It is perfectly possible therefore that the conception of the iconographie message of the portai should have taken shape with those chapters of the Apocalypse in mind. II paraît désormais établi que le tympan du portail central de la nef de Vézelay est effectivement consacré au thème de la Pentecôte, un événement qui, au moyen âge, était déjà conçu, notamment, comme l'acte fondateur de l'Église. En plusieurs endroits du portail, des figures d'apôtres indiquent que l'Église œuvre déjà par la prédication et l'enseignement. Pour évoquer cette institution, le concepteur semble avoir utilisé les deux derniers chapitres de l'Apocalypse (XXI et XXII), ainsi que l'exégèse qui s'y rapporte. Ces textes présentent en effet la particularité de mentionner, de manière plus ou moins explicite, la quasi totalité des composantes du portail. Ils donnent ainsi un sens à la présence de certaines d'entre elles : les <b>ondulations</b> situées aux pieds du Christ, le trône sur lequel ce dernier est assis, les figures des ébrasements et celle de Jean-Baptiste, et surtout le zodiaque, les quatre médaillons qui l'interrompent et les deux chapiteaux de droite.

6000|$|... {illust. caption = FIG. 14.--Head of snarling Dog. From life, by Mr. Wood. whole {{appearance}} of the face. The lips hang loosely, and the hair remains smooth. All these movements or gestures are explicable, as I believe, from their standing in complete antithesis to those naturally assumed by a savage dog under a directly opposite state of mind. When a man merely speaks to, or just notices, his dog,we see the last vestige of these movements in a slight wag of the tail, without any other movement of the body, and without even the ears being lowered. Dogs also exhibit their affection by desiring to rub against their masters, and to be rubbed or patted by them. Gratiolet explains the above gestures of affection in the following manner: and the reader can judge whether the explanation appears satisfactory. Speaking of animals in general, including the dog, he says,[2] [...] "C'est toujours la partie la plus sensible de leurs corps qui recherche les caresses ou les donne. Lorsque toute la longueur des flancs et du corps est sensible, l'animal serpente et rampe sous les caresses; et ces <b>ondulations</b> se propageant le long des muscles analogues des segments jusqu'aux extremites de la colonne vertebrale, la queue se ploie et s'agite." [...] Further on, he adds, that dogs, when feeling affectionate, lower their ears in order to exclude all sounds, so that their whole attention may be concentrated on the caresses of their master! Dogs have another and striking way of exhibiting their affection, namely, by licking the hands or faces of their masters. They sometimes lick other dogs, and then it is always their chops. I have also seen dogs licking cats with whom they were friends. This habit probably originated in the females carefully licking their puppies--the dearest object of their love--for the sake of cleansing them. They also often give their puppies, after a short absence, a few cursory licks, apparently from affection. Thus the habit will have become associated with the emotion of love, however it may afterwards be aroused. It is now so firmly inherited or innate, That it is transmitted equally to both sexes. A female terrier of mine lately had her puppies destroyed, and though at all times a very affectionate creature, I was much struck with {{the manner in which}} she then tried to satisfy her instinctive maternal love by expending it on me; and her desire to lick my hands rose to an insatiable passion. [1] `De la Physionomie,' 1865, pp. 187, 218.The same principle probably explains why dogs, when feeling affectionate, like rubbing against their masters and being rubbed or patted by them, for from the nursing of their puppies, contact with a beloved object has become firmly associated in their minds with the emotion of love. The feeling of affection of a dog towards his master is combined with a strong sense of submission, which is akin to fear. Hence dogs not only lower their bodies and crouch a little as they approach their masters, but sometimes throw themselves on the ground with their bellies upwards. This is a movement as completely opposite as is possible to any show of resistance. I formerly possessed a large dog who was not at all afraid to fight with other dogs; but a wolf-like shepherd-dog in the neighbourhood, though not ferocious and not so powerful as my dog, had a strange influence over him. When they met on the road, my dog used to run to meet him, with his tail partly tucked in between his legs and hair not erected; and then be would throw himself on the ground, belly upwards. By this action he seemed to say more plainly than by words, [...] "Behold, I am your slave." [...] A pleasurable and excited state of mind, associated with affection, is exhibited by some dogs in a very peculiar manner, namely, by grinning. This was noticed long ago by Somerville, who says, And with a courtly grin, the fawning bound Salutes thee cow'ring, his wide op'ning nose Upward he curls, and his large sloe-back eyes Melt in soft blandishments, and humble joy.' The Chase, book i.Sir W. Scott's famous Scotch greyhound, Maida, had this habit, and it is common with terriers. I have also seen it in a Spitz and in a sheep-dog. Mr. Riviere, who has particularly attended to this expression, informs me that it is rarely displayed in a perfect manner, but is quite common in a lesser degree. The upper lip during the act of grinning is retracted, as in snarling, so that the canines are exposed, and the ears are drawn backwards; but the general {{appearance of}} the animal clearly shows that anger is not felt. Sir C. Bell[3] remarks [...] "Dogs, in their expression of fondness, have a slight eversion of the lips, and grin and sniff amidst their gambols, in a way that resembles laughter." [...] Some persons speak of the grin as a smile, but if it had been really a smile, we should see a similar, though more pronounced, movement of the lips and ears, when dogs utter their bark of joy; {{but this is not the}} case, although a bark of joy often follows a grin. On the other hand, dogs, when playing with their comrades or masters, almost always pretend to bite each other; and they then retract, though not energetically, their lips and ears. Hence I suspect that there is a tendency in some dogs, whenever they feel lively pleasure combined with affection, to act through habit and association on the same muscles, as in playfully biting each other, or their masters' hands. I have described, in the second chapter, the gait and appearance of a dog when cheerful, and the marked antithesis presented by the same animal when dejected and disappointed, with his head, ears, body, tail, and chops drooping, and eyes dull. Under the expectation of any great pleasure, dogs bound and jump about in an extravagant manner, and bark for joy. The tendency to bark under this state of mind is inherited, or runs in the breed: greyhounds rarely bark, whilst the Spitz-dog barks so incessantly on starting for a walk with his master that he becomes a nuisance. [1] `The Anatomy of Expression,' 1844, p. 140.An agony of pain is expressed by dogs in nearly the same way as by many other animals, namely, by howling writhing, and contortions of the whole body. Attention is shown by the head being raised, with the ears erected, and eyes intently directed towards the object or quarter under observation. If it be a sound and the source is not known, the head is often turned obliquely from side to side in a most significant manner, apparently in order to judge with more exactness from what point the sound proceeds. But I have seen a dog greatly surprised at a new noise, turning, his head to one side through habit, though he clearly perceived the source of the noise. Dogs, as formerly remarked, when their attention is in any way aroused, whilst watching some object, or attending to some sound, often lift up one paw (fig. 4) and keep it doubled up, as if to make a slow and stealthy approach. A dog under extreme terror will throw himself down, howl, and void his excretions; but the hair, I believe, does not become erect unless some anger is felt. I have seen a dog much terrified at a band of musicians who were playing loudly outside the house, with every muscle of his body trembling, with his heart palpitating so quickly that the beats could hardly be counted, and panting for breath with widely open mouth, in the same manner as a terrified man does. Yet this dog had not exerted himself; he had only wandered slowly and restlessly about the room, and the day was cold. Even a very slight degree of fear is invariably shown by the tail being tucked in between the legs. This tucking in of the fail is accompanied by the ears being drawn backwards; but they are not pressed closely to the head,as in snarling, and they are not lowered, as when a dog is pleased or affectionate. When two young dogs chase each other in play, the one that runs away always keeps his tail tucked inwards. So it is when a dog, in the highest spirits, careers like a mad creature round and round his master in circles, or in figures of eight. He then acts as if another dog were chasing him. This curious kind of play, which must be familiar to every one who has attended to dogs, is particularly apt to be excited, after the animal has been a little startled or frightened, as by his master suddenly jumping out on him in the dusk. In this case, as well as when two young dogs are chasing each other in play, it appears as if the one that runs away was afraid of the other catching him by the tail; but as far as I can find out, dogs very rarely catch each other in this manner. I asked a gentleman, who had kept foxhounds all his life, and be applied to other experienced sportsmen, whether they had ever seen hounds thus seize a fox; but they never had. It appears that when a dog is chased, or when in danger of being struck behind, or of anything falling on him, in all these cases he wishes to withdraw as quickly as possible his whole hind-quarters, and that from some sympathy or connection between the muscles, the tail is then drawn closely inwards. A similarly connected movement between the hind- quarters and the tail may be observed in the hyaena. Mr. Bartlett informs me that when two of these animals fight together, they are mutually conscious of the wonderful power of each other's jaws, and are extremely cautious. They well know that if one of their legs were seized, the bone would instantly be crushed into atoms; hence they approach each other kneeling, with their legs turned as much as possible inwards, and with their whole bodies bowed, so as not to present any salient point; thetail at the same time being closely tucked in between the legs. In this attitude they approach each other sideways, or even partly backwards. So again with deer, several of the species, when savage and fighting, tuck in their tails. When one horse in a field tries to bite the hind-quarters of another in play, or when a rough boy strikes a donkey from behind, the hind-quarters and the tail are drawn in, though it does not appear as if this were done merely to save the tail from being injured. We have also seen the reverse of these movements; for when an animal trots with high elastic steps, the tail is almost always carried aloft. As I have said, when a dog is chased and runs away, he keeps his ears directed backwards but still open; and this is clearly done for the sake of hearing the footsteps of his pursuer. From habit the ears are often held in this same position, and the tail tucked in, when the danger is obviously in front. I have repeatedly noticed, with a timid terrier of mine, that when she is afraid of some object in front, the nature of which she perfectly knows and does not need to reconnoitre, yet she will for a long time hold her ears and tail in this position, looking the image of discomfort. Discomfort, without any fear, is similarly expressed: thus, one day I went out of doors, just at the time when this same dog knew that her dinner would be brought. I did not call her, but she wished much to accompany me, and at the same time she wished much for her dinner; and there she stood, first looking one way and then the other, with her tail tucked in and ears drawn back, presenting an unmistakable appearance of perplexed discomfort. Almost all the expressive movements now described, with the exception of the grinning from joy, are innate or instinctive, for they are common to all the individuals, young and old, of all the breeds. Most of themare likewise common to the aboriginal parents of the dog, namely the wolf and jackal; and some of them to other species of the same group. Tamed wolves and jackals, when caressed by their masters, jump about for joy, wag their tails, lower their ears, lick their master's hands, crouch down, and even throw themselves on the ground belly upwards.[4] I have seen a rather fox-like African jackal, from the Gaboon, depress its ears when caressed. Wolves and jackals, when frightened, certainly tuck in their tails; and a tamed jackal has been described as careering round his master in circles and figures of eight, like a dog, with his tail between his legs. It has been stated[5] that foxes, however tame, never display any of the above expressive movements; but this is not strictly accurate. Many years ago I observed in the Zoological Gardens, and recorded the fact at the time, that a very tame English fox, When caressed by the keeper, wagged its tail, depressed its ears, and then threw itself on the ground, belly upwards. The black fox of North America likewise depressed its ears in a slight degree. But I believe that foxes never lick the hands of their masters, and I have been assured that when frightened they never tuck in their tails. If the explanation which I have given of the expression of affection in dogs be admitted, then it would appear that animals which have never been domesticated--namely wolves, jackals, and even foxes-- have nevertheless ac- quired, through the principle of antithesis, certain expressive gestures; for it is Dot probable that these animals, confined in cages, should have learnt them by imitating dogs. [4] Many particulars are given by Gueldenstadt in his account of the jackal in Nov. Comm. Acad. Sc. Imp. Petrop. 1775, tom. xx. p. 449. See also another excellent account of the manners of this animal and of its play, in `Land and Water,' October, 1869. Lieut. Annesley, R. A., has also communicated to me some particulars with respect to the jackal. I have made many inquiries about wolves and jackals in the Zoological Gardens, and have observed them for myself.
