5|$|Dylan has {{published}} Tarantula, {{a work of}} prose poetry, , {{the first part of}} his memoirs, several books of the lyrics <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>songs,</b> and seven books of his art. He {{has been the subject of}} many biographies and critical studies.|$|E
5|$|The basslines in {{his songs}} {{tend to be}} melodically dynamic, rising and falling in a {{dramatic}} fashion. Polyrhythms are also apparent, particularly in songs with Indian folk or Carnatic influences. The melodic structure <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>songs</b> demand considerable vocal virtuosity, and have found expressive platform amongst some of India's respected vocalists and playback singers, such as Rajkumar, T. M. Soundararajan, K. J. Yesudas, S. P. Balasubrahmanyam, S. Janaki, P. Susheela, Asha Bhosle, Lata Mangeshkar, Jayachandran, S. P. Sailaja, Jency, Swarnalatha, K. S. Chithra, Minmini, Sujatha, Malaysia Vasudevan, Kavita Krishnamurthy, Hariharan, Udit Narayan, Sadhana Sargam and Shreya Ghoshal. Ilaiyaraaja has sung over 400 of his own compositions for films, and is recognisable by his stark, deep voice. He has penned the lyrics for some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>songs</b> in Tamil.|$|E

All seven of his studio albums have been certified at least platinum in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor that}} helped Tchaikovsky's music become popular was {{a shift in}} {{attitude}} among Russian audiences. Whereas they had previously been satisfied with flashy virtuoso performances of technically demanding but musically lightweight compositions, they gradually began listening with increasing appreciation of the music itself. Tchaikovsky's works were performed frequently, with few delays between their composition and first performances; the publication from 1867 onward <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>songs</b> and great piano music for the home market also helped boost the composer's popularity.|$|E
5|$|Besides the {{internal}} references {{that they often}} make to earlier passages within them, Schubert's last sonatas contain distinct allusions and resemblances {{to some of his}} previous works, mostly earlier piano works, as well as many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>songs.</b> Important similarities also exist between certain passages in the sonatas and works from other genres that were composed in parallel, during the same months in 1828.|$|E

5|$|By the 1990s Adkins {{had gained}} a cult {{following}} and began touring regularly, receiving offers from more record labels. In 1994 Miles Copeland III of I.R.S. Records purchased {{the rights to}} Adkins' recordings, and although an album was planned for release, it never materialized. Frustrated, Adkins soon gained back rights to some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>songs</b> after a deal with Mississippi blues label Fat Possum, who recorded and released 1999's What The Hell Was I Thinking? and booked him a tour alongside T-Model Ford and Elmo Williams.|$|E

Despondent, Brian then begins singing the theme song to 1972 NBC sitcom Sanford and Son. The scene is not shown on TV; Stewie and Brian sneak into the concert in the televised version.|$|E
5|$|In Massenet's later years, and in {{the decade}} after his death, many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>songs</b> and opera {{extracts}} were recorded. Some of the performers were the original creators of the roles, such as Ernest van Dyck (Werther), Emma Calvé (Sapho), Hector Dufranne (Grisélidis), and Vanni Marcoux (Panurge). Complete French recordings of Manon and Werther, conducted by Élie Cohen, were issued in 1932 and 1933 and have been republished on CD. The critic Alan Blyth comments that they embody the original, intimate Opéra-Comique style of performing Massenet.|$|E

5|$|In {{his early}} career Redding mostly covered songs from popular artists, such as Richard, Cooke and Solomon Burke. Around the mid-1960s he began writing his own songs—always taking along his cheap red {{acoustic}} guitar—and sometimes asked for Stax members' opinion of his lyrics. He often worked on lyrics with other musicians, such as Simms, Rodgers, Huckaby, Phil Walden and Cropper. During his recovery from his throat operation, Redding wrote about 30 songs in two weeks. Redding {{was the sole}} copyright holder on all <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>songs.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} years, and for decades after his death, Poulenc had a reputation, {{particularly}} {{in his native}} country, as a humorous, lightweight composer, and his religious music was often overlooked. During the 21st century more {{attention has been given}} to his serious works, with many new productions of Dialogues des Carmélites and La voix humaine worldwide, and numerous live and recorded performances <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>songs</b> and choral music.|$|E
5|$|Lennon {{revealed}} a rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, writing, drawings, on film and in interviews. Controversial through his political and peace activism, {{he moved from}} London to Manhattan in 1971, where his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a lengthy attempt by the Nixon administration to deport him. Some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>songs</b> were adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger counterculture.|$|E

5|$|The {{experience}} reinforced Drake's {{decision to}} retreat from live appearances; the few concerts he did play around this time were usually brief, awkward, and poorly attended. Drake seemed reluctant to perform and rarely addressed his audience. As many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>songs</b> were played in different tunings, he frequently paused to retune between numbers.|$|E
5|$|Adam Evans/Rubber-Band Man (voiced by Kadeem Hardison) – A meta-human {{whose body}} {{structure}} consists of shapeable rubber. He is {{the younger brother}} of Static's archenemy, Ebon.

He and Sharon eventually start dating, with Sharon helping Adam turn over a new leaf. He and Virgil initially clash, but Virgil comes to accept Adam's relationship with his sister and they become allies in crime-fighting, with Adam even becoming like an older-brother figure to Virgil.|$|E

5|$|After the 1976 tour, Townshend took {{most of the}} {{following}} year off {{to spend time with}} his family. He discovered that former Beatles and Rolling Stones manager Allen Klein had bought a stake in his publishing company. A settlement was reached, but Townshend was upset and disillusioned that Klein had attempted to take ownership <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>songs.</b> Townshend went to the Speakeasy where he met the Sex Pistols' Steve Jones and Paul Cook, fans of the Who. After leaving, he passed out in a doorway, where a policeman said he would not be arrested if he could stand and walk. The events inspired the title track of the next album, Who Are You.|$|E
5|$|Arriving in Iaşi (Jassy) in 1876, Goldfaden was {{fortunate}} to be better known as a good poet — many of whose poems had been set to music and had become popular songs — than as a less-than-successful businessman. Nevertheless, when he sought funds from Isaac Librescu for another newspaper, Librescu was uninterested in that proposition. Librescu's wife remarked that Yiddish-language journalism was {{just a way to}} starve; she suggested {{that there would be a}} lot more of a market for Yiddish-language theater. Librescu offered Goldfaden 100 francs for a public recital <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>songs</b> in the garden of Shimen Mark, Grădina Pomul Verde ("the Green Fruit-Tree Garden").|$|E
5|$|Bellman {{has been}} {{translated}} into at least 20 languages, including English, most notably by Paul Britten Austin, and into German, for example by Hannes Wader.

Bellman's songs have been translated and recorded in Icelandic (by Bubbi), Italian, French, Finnish (for instance by Vesa-Matti Loiri), Russian, Chuvash and Yiddish. English interpretations have been recorded by William Clauson, Martin Best, Freddie Langrind made some Norwegian translations in 2008. Sven-Bertil Taube, Roger Hinchliffe and Martin Bagge.
