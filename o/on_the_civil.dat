5|$|The rise of totalitarian {{regimes in}} Germany, Russia, and other {{countries}} who rejected {{freedom of speech and}} association had a large impact <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> liberties movement in the U.S.; anti-communist sentiment rose and civil liberties were curtailed.|$|E
5|$|A free {{jazz and}} {{contemporary}} classical work, Ten Freedom Summers comprises 19 pieces that are mostly fully developed suites. They eschew conventional themes for abstract {{expressions of the}} subject matter, which focuses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> Rights Movement and other interrelated topics. Smith cites the segregation of his native Mississippi and playwright August Wilson's The Pittsburgh Cycle as inspirations behind the work. Ten Freedom Summers received widespread critical acclaim and was named {{a finalist for the}} Pulitzer Prize for Music in 2013.|$|E
5|$|On 10 June 1859, the 19-year-old Tchaikovsky {{graduated}} as a titular counselor, a low rung <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> service ladder.

He remained a senior assistant {{for the rest of}} his three-year civil service career.|$|E

5|$|Roger was consecrated Archbishop of York on 10 October 1154. When he went {{north to}} York, the legal scholar Vacarius, {{who had been}} part of Theobald's household, {{followed}} Roger and spent the next 50 years in the north. Vacarius was responsible for introducing Roman civil law into England, and did so under the patronage of Roger. He wrote a standard textbook <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> law, the Liber pauperum, and was an important advisor for Roger.|$|E

5|$|Historically {{influenced}} by Chinese law, the Japanese legal system developed independently during the Edo period through texts such as Kujikata Osadamegaki. However, {{since the late}} 19th century the judicial system has been largely based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> law of Europe, notably Germany. For example, in 1896, the Japanese government established a civil code based on {{a draft of the}} German Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch; with the code remaining in effect with post–World War II modifications. Statutory law originates in Japan's legislature and has the rubber stamp of the Emperor. Japan's court system is divided into four basic tiers: the Supreme Court and three levels of lower courts. The main body of Japanese statutory law is called the Six Codes.|$|E
5|$|Houphouët-Boigny {{was also}} a major {{contributor}} to the political tensions in Biafra. Considering Nigeria a potential danger to French-influenced African states, Foccart sent Houphouët-Boigny and Lieutenant-Colonel Raymond Bichelot on a mission in 1963 to monitor political developments in the country. The opportunity to weaken the former British colony presented itself in May 1967, when Biafra, led by Lieutenant-Colonel Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, undertook to secede from Nigeria. French-aligned African countries supported the secessionists who, provided with mercenaries and weapons by Jean Mauricheau-Beaupré, began a civil war. By the end of the 1960s, French-supported nations suddenly and openly distanced themselves from France and Côte d'Ivoire's position <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> war. Isolated on the international scene, both countries decided to suspend their assistance to Ojukwu, who eventually went into exile in Côte d'Ivoire.|$|E
5|$|Human Rights Commission: In {{a report}} on de facto couples {{presented}} to the Justice Minister in May 2006, the Irish Human Rights Commission evaluated international standards in dealing with unmarried couples, and assessed the changes needed in Irish law from a human rights perspective. The Commission called for legal recognition of all de facto relationships, but did not call for civil marriage to {{be made available to}} same-sex couples. The IHRC has also released a report <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> partnership scheme in January 2009.|$|E

5|$|Starting with {{victory in}} the Revolution, there were many {{proposals}} to build a monument to Washington. After his death, Congress authorized a suitable memorial in the national capital, but the decision was reversed when the Democratic-Republican Party (Jeffersonian Republicans) took control of Congress in 1801. The Republicans were dismayed that Washington had become {{the symbol of the}} Federalist Party; furthermore the values of Republicanism seemed hostile to the idea of building monuments to powerful men. They also blocked his image on coins or the celebration of his birthday. Further political squabbling, along with the North-South division <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> War, blocked the completion of the Washington Monument until the late 19th century. By that time, Washington had the image of a national hero who could be celebrated by both North and South, and memorials to him were no longer controversial.|$|E
5|$|There {{had been}} limited affirmative action {{programmes}} before. However, these mostly focused <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> service, as Article 153 of the Constitution did. Admission {{to higher education}} was largely merit-based. The Tunku government preferred laissez-faire policies, minimising economic intervention. Although some agencies, such as the Rural Industrial Development Agency (RIDA), which attempted to aid Malay entrepreneurs, existed, their programs were criticised as being based on handouts and favouring the politically connected. RIDA was renamed as the Majlis Amanah Rakyat (The Indigenous People's Trust Council) or MARA in 1965, and came to symbolise the development of Malay entrepreneurship.|$|E
5|$|Dam asked Vann, who was {{circling}} the battlefield aboard an L-19 reconnaissance aircraft, to reconnoiter possible landing zones {{on the east}} and west sides of Ap Bac, where additional reinforcements could be inserted to launch their attacks. In response, Vann asked his pilot to make low passes over the trees which covered Ap Bac. Although he could not see any Viet Cong positions, Vann knew there was a well-fortified position {{at the south end of}} the hamlet, due to the impact of the Viet Cong's firepower <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> Guards since the battle's inception. As Vann's L-19 aircraft flew over the western tree line, the Viet Cong watched from their foxholes, but held their fire because they knew the aircraft was trying to draw fire in order to mark their positions. Although Vann was suspicious, he decided it was a better landing zone because the area was tranquil despite the heavy fighting elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his lecture}} series, Blackstone became more {{prominent}} in convocation and other university activities. Oxford and Cambridge {{at the time}} had a strange system of law; due to their unique natures, they had exclusive jurisdiction over both academics and students in a fashion which followed either the common law or their own customs, based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> law. With his appointment as assessor (or chief legal officer) of the Chancellor's Court, Blackstone became far {{more involved in the}} university's peculiar legal system, and records show him sitting between eight and ten times a year from 1753 to 1759, mainly dealing with small claims of debt. He also wrote a manual on the Court's practice, and through his position gained a large number of contacts and connections, as well as visibility, which aided his legal career significantly. This period also saw Blackstone write his last known piece of poetry, Friendship: An Ode, in 1756.|$|E
5|$|The {{denial of}} the style Royal Highness to the Duchess of Windsor caused further conflict, as did the {{financial}} settlement. The Government declined to include the Duke or Duchess <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> List, and the Duke's allowance was paid personally by George VI. The Duke compromised his position with his brother by concealing {{the extent of his}} financial worth when they informally agreed on the amount of the allowance. Edward's wealth had accumulated from the revenues of the Duchy of Cornwall paid to him as Prince of Wales and ordinarily at the disposal of an incoming king. George VI also paid Edward for Sandringham House and Balmoral Castle, which were Edward's personal property, inherited from his father, George V, and thus did not automatically pass to George VI on his accession. In the early days of George VI's reign the Duke telephoned daily, importuning for money and urging that the Duchess be granted the style of Royal Highness, until the harassed king ordered that the calls not be put through.|$|E
