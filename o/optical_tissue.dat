40|$|Light {{propagating}} in tissue attains {{a spectrum}} that varies with location due to wavelength-dependent fluence attenuation by <b>tissue</b> <b>optical</b> properties, an effect that causes spectral corruption. Predictions of the spectral variations of light fluence in tissue are challenging since the {{spatial distribution of}} <b>optical</b> properties in <b>tissue</b> cannot be resolved in high resolution or with high accuracy by current methods. Spectral corruption has fundamentally limited the quantification accuracy of optical and optoacoustic methods and impeded the long sought-after goal of imaging blood oxygen saturation (sO 2) deep in tissues; a critical but still unattainable target {{for the assessment of}} oxygenation in physiological processes and disease. We discover a new principle underlying light fluence in tissues, which describes the wavelength dependence of light fluence as an affine function of a few reference base spectra, independently of the specific distribution of <b>tissue</b> <b>optical</b> properties. This finding enables the introduction of a previously undocumented concept termed eigenspectra Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography (eMSOT) that can effectively account for wavelength dependent light attenuation without explicit knowledge of the <b>tissue</b> <b>optical</b> properties.

We find that eMSOT can quantitatively image tissue sO 2 reaching in many occasions a better than 10 -fold improved accuracy over conventional spectral optoacoustic methods. Then, we show that eMSOT can spatially resolve sO 2 in muscle and tumor; revealing so far unattainable tissue physiology patterns.

40|$|Abstract Background Optical diffuse {{reflectance}} can remotely differentiate various bio tissues. To implement this technique in an optical feedback system to guide laser surgery in a tissue-specific way, the alteration of <b>optical</b> <b>tissue</b> properties by laser ablation {{has to be}} taken into account. It was the aim of this study to evaluate the general feasibility of optical soft tissue differentiation by {{diffuse reflectance}} spectroscopy under the influence of laser ablation, comparing the tissue differentiation results before and after laser intervention. Methods A total of 70 ex vivo tissue samples (5 tissue types) were taken from 14 bisected pig heads. Diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded before and after Er:YAG-laser ablation. The spectra were analyzed and differentiated using principal component analysis (PCA), followed by linear discriminant analysis (LDA). To assess the potential of tissue differentiation, area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity was computed for each pair of tissue types before and after laser ablation, and compared to each other. Results <b>Optical</b> <b>tissue</b> differentiation showed good results before laser exposure (total classification error 13. 51 %). However, the tissue pair nerve and fat yielded lower AUC results of only 0. 75. After laser ablation slightly reduced differentiation results were found with a total classification error of 16. 83 %. The tissue pair nerve and fat showed enhanced differentiation (AUC: 0. 85). Laser ablation reduced the sensitivity in 50 % and specificity in 80 % of the cases of tissue pair comparison. The sensitivity of nerve–fat differentiation was enhanced by 35 %. Conclusions The observed results show the general feasibility of tissue differentiation by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy even under conditions of tissue alteration by laser ablation. The contrast enhancement for the differentiation between nerve and fat tissue after ablation is assumed to be due to laser removal of the surrounding lipid-rich nerve sheath. The results create the basis for a guidance system to control laser ablation in a tissue-specific way. </p...|$|E

40|$|For {{clinical}} optoacoustic imaging, linear probes are preferably {{used because}} they allow versatile imaging {{of the human}} body with real-time display and free-hand probe guidance. The two-dimensional (2 -D) optoacoustic image obtained with this type of probe is generally interpreted as a 2 -D cross-section of the tissue just as is common in echo ultrasound. We demonstrate in three-dimensional simulations, phantom experiments, and in vivo mouse experiments that for vascular imaging this interpretation is often inaccurate. The cylindrical blood vessels emit anisotropic acoustic transients, which can be sensitively detected only if the direction of acoustic radiation coincides with the probe aperture. Our results reveal for this reason that the signal amplitude of different blood vessels may differ even if the vessels have the same diameter and initial pressure distribution but different orientation relative to the imaging plane.

Materials and Methods: A flexible silicone applicator was developed, incorporating light delivery and dosimetry fibers. The applicator can be inserted through the mouth and fixed in the nasopharyngeal cavity. <b>Tissue</b> <b>optical</b> phantoms were prepared on the basis of optical properties measured in vivo using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). The fluence rate over the length of the applicator surface was measured in air, in <b>tissue</b> <b>optical</b> phantoms and in five healthy volunteers. Results: The fluence rate distribution over the applicator surface in air and <b>tissue</b> <b>optical</b> phantom was found to be more homogeneous (SD/mean 3. 8 % and 18. 3 %, respectively) than the fluence rate distribution in five volunteers (SD/mean ranging from 19 % up to 52 %). The maximum observed fluence rate build-up in the nasopharynx varied between subjects and ranged from a factor of 4. 1 - 6. 9. Shielding of the risk area such as the soft palate and tongue was effective. Conclusions: In air and in <b>tissue</b> <b>optical</b> phantoms the fluence rate distribution of the device was highly homogeneous. The observed inter-subject and intra-subject variations in fluence rate in healthy volunteers originated from differences in optical properties and nasopharyngeal geometry. Light delivery based on a single tissue surface measurement will not be adequate.
