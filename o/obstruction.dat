5|$|Actual or {{impending}} airway <b>obstruction</b> is {{a common}} indication for intubation of the trachea. Life-threatening airway <b>obstruction</b> may occur when a foreign body becomes lodged in the airway; this is especially common in infants and toddlers. Severe blunt or penetrating injury to the face or neck may be accompanied by swelling and an expanding hematoma, or injury to the larynx, trachea or bronchi. Airway <b>obstruction</b> is also common in people who have suffered smoke inhalation or burns within or near the airway or epiglottitis. Sustained generalized seizure activity and angioedema are other common causes of life-threatening airway <b>obstruction</b> which may require tracheal intubation to secure the airway.|$|E

5|$|Bacterial {{contamination}} {{alone in}} absence of <b>obstruction</b> does not usually result in cholangitis. However increased pressure within the biliary system (above 20 cmH2O) resulting from <b>obstruction</b> in the bile duct widens {{spaces between the}} cells lining the duct, bringing bacterially contaminated bile {{in contact with the}} blood stream. It also adversely affects the function of Kupffer cells, which are specialized macrophage cells that assist in preventing bacteria from entering the biliary system. Finally, increased biliary pressure decreases production of IgA immunoglobulins in the bile. This results in bacteremia (bacteria in the blood stream) and gives rise to the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) comprising fever (often with rigors), tachycardia, increased respiratory rate and increased white blood cell count; SIRS in the presence of suspected or confirmed infection is called sepsis. Biliary <b>obstruction</b> itself disadvantages the immune system and impairs its capability to fight infection, by impairing the function of certain immune system cells (neutrophil granulocytes) and modifying the levels of immune hormones (cytokines).|$|E

40|$|It is {{recognized}} that cooling methods incorporating micro-channel heat sinks with high capacities of heat removal {{are necessary for}} cooling of electronic devices. In this paper, based on a water-cooled smooth micro-channel heat sink, a series of rectangular-shaped flow <b>obstructions</b> are designed into a heat sink, and then the corresponding laminar flow and heat transfer have been analyzed numerically by computational fluid dynamics. Five different configurations of the flow <b>obstructions</b> are considered by adjusting {{the length of the}} flow <b>obstructions.</b> The influence of the length of the flow <b>obstructions</b> on heat transfer, pressure drop, and thermal resistance is also observed and compared to that of the traditional smooth micro-channel heat sink without flow <b>obstructions.</b> The overall resistance versus inlet Reynolds number and pumping power are also compared for whole micro-channel heat sinks (including smooth micro-channel heat sink). The results show that the capacity of heat removal of micro-channel heat sinks with flow <b>obstructions</b> is much better than that of the corresponding straight micro-channel heat sink. It is found that the length of the flow <b>obstructions</b> has a major influence on thermal performance. In other words, the flow <b>obstructions</b> placed in the micro-channel heat sink can improve thermal performance...|$|R
40|$|Physical <b>obstructions</b> {{that reduce}} space for root growth can profoundly affect plant performance. The {{aim of this}} study was to {{investigate}} the ability of roots to avoid <b>obstructions</b> and forage for usable space, and to reveal the mechanism involved. - Eight grass species from four genera were examined. Each genus included species characteristic of habitats with high and low nutrient availability. The ability to limit root mass and to adjust morphology within substrate containing <b>obstructions</b> in the form of gravel was investigated. A treatment with activated carbon, which adsorbs organic compounds, was used to examine the possible involvement of root exudates in responses to <b>obstructions.</b> - Only species characteristic of nutrient-poor habitats restricted placement of root mass in substrate containing <b>obstructions,</b> and this response disappeared in the presence of activated carbon. Root morphological responses to <b>obstructions</b> differed from those shown in response to nutrient-poor conditions or compacted soil. - These results suggest that the ability to avoid <b>obstructions</b> is dependent on the sensitivity of roots to their own exudates accumulating in the vicinity of <b>obstructions.</b> This is similar to other behavioural responses in which cues or signals are used to adjust growth before stressful conditions are encountered...|$|R

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} a {{detailed}} analysis of the problem of imposing a topological bundle structure on a spherical fibre space over a simply connected base. The method involves a careful study of the notion of fibre homotopy transversality due to N. Levitt. The point is, a topological disc bundle satisfies strong transversality properties for maps from manifolds to the associated Thorn space. These pro-perties can be formulated at least for spherical fibre spaces. Thus, <b>obstructions</b> to transversality can be interpreted as <b>obstructions</b> to imposing a topological bundle structure on a spherical fibre space. It turns out that over a simply con-nected base the <b>obstructions</b> to transversality coincide exactly with the <b>obstructions</b> to a topological structure.

5|$|Narrowed {{areas may}} be bridged by a stent, a hollow tube {{that keeps the}} duct open. Removable plastic stents are used in {{uncomplicated}} gallstone disease, while permanent self-expanding metal stents with a longer lifespan are used if the <b>obstruction</b> is due to pressure from a tumor such as pancreatic cancer. A nasobiliary drain may be left behind; this is a plastic tube that passes from the bile duct through the stomach and the nose and allows continuous drainage of bile into a receptible. It {{is similar to a}} nasogastric tube, but passes into the common bile duct directly, and allows for serial x-ray cholangiograms to be done to identify the improvement of the <b>obstruction.</b> The decision on which of the aforementioned treatments to apply is generally based on the severity of the <b>obstruction,</b> findings on other imaging studies, and whether the patient has improved with antibiotic treatment. Certain treatments may be unsafe if blood clotting is impaired, as the risk of bleeding (especially from sphincterotomy) is increased in the use of medication such as clopidogrel (which inhibits platelet aggregation) or if the prothrombin time is significantly prolonged. For a prolonged prothrombin time, vitamin K or fresh frozen plasma may be administered to reduce bleeding risk.|$|E

40|$|Biodiesel is {{considered}} {{a viable alternative to}} the use of diesel. Transesterification is the most used method of biodiesel production and usually occurs in batch reactors and requires several minutes or hours to achieve high yield rates. However, this process has been recently tested in microreactors. One of the most important elements of these microreactors is the micromixer, which should perform a quick and efficient mixing of reactants. Micromixers with circular <b>obstructions</b> split and recombine the flow stream, increasing the interaction of chemical species. Therefore, we carried out numerical simulations of Jatropha curcas oil-ethanol mixing and reaction in micromixers with circular <b>obstructions.</b> Three different micromixers were investigated: T-channel, T-channel with circular <b>obstructions</b> and T-channel with alternate circular <b>obstructions.</b> A mixing study was conducted for Reynolds number ranging from 1 to 160 and residence times for reaction of 0. 20 - 100 s. The T-channel with alternate circular <b>obstructions</b> showed the highest degree of mixing (0. 99). The presence of obstacles improved the conversion of species. Maximum conversion was 99. 07 % CT-channel), 99. 01 % (T-channel with circular <b>obstructions)</b> and 99. 09 % (T-channel with alternate circular <b>obstructions).</b> The effectiveness of using channels with circular <b>obstructions</b> in biodiesel synthesis was numerically demonstrated.
