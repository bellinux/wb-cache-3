50|$|A {{systematic}} review published by Chen et al. in 2010 stated that shortened chair time and slightly less incisor proclination {{appear to be}} the only significant advantages of self-ligating systems over conventional systems that are supported by the current evidence. On the other hand, a study published by Papageorgiou et al. stated that their analysis showed treatment time being longer when self ligated <b>orthodontic</b> <b>brackets</b> are used compared to conventional <b>orthodontic</b> <b>brackets.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{the course}} of {{treatment}} <b>orthodontic</b> <b>brackets</b> may pop off due to the forces involved, or due to cement weakening over time. The orthodontist should be contacted immediately for advice if this occurs. In most cases the bracket is replaced.|$|E

5000|$|Jaw wiring is {{performed}} by attaching <b>orthodontic</b> <b>brackets</b> to the teeth, and wrapping pliable wire either around {{or through the}} brackets. The wiring is configured to place the patient’s lower jaw in a semi-closed resting position. This permits a moderate amount of jaw movement and relatively clear speech, but inhibits the ingestion of solid foods, forcing patients to adhere to a liquid diet.|$|E
50|$|Lingual braces {{are one of}} {{the many}} types of the fixed {{orthodontic}} treatment appliances available to patients needing orthodontics. It involves attaching the <b>orthodontic</b> <b>brackets</b> on the inner sides of the teeth. The main advantage of lingual braces is its near invisibility compared to the standard braces which are attached on the buccal sides of the tooth. Lingual braces were invented by Craven Kurz in 1976.|$|E
5000|$|For {{comprehensive}} orthodontic treatment, metal wires are {{inserted into}} <b>orthodontic</b> <b>brackets</b> (braces), {{which can be}} made from stainless steel or a more aesthetic ceramic material. The wires interact with the brackets to move teeth into the desired positions. Invisalign or other aligner trays consist of clear plastic trays that move teeth. Functional appliances are often used to redirect jaw growth. Extensive research has been done proving the effectiveness of functional appliances on adults, and many professionals perform the procedure on adult patients to very positive results ...|$|E
30|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{biocompatibility}} of the nanosilver-coated <b>orthodontic</b> <b>bracket</b> was evaluated by subcutaneous implantation tests since this newly designed <b>orthodontic</b> <b>bracket</b> {{will be in}} contact with or placed near the gingiva and oral epithelium during orthodontic treatment. The sample size in animal studies of nanosilver cytotoxicity per group varies considerably in literature [35, 36]. Proper experimental design and statistical analysis of the proposed research project allows the optimum number of animals to be used. Reduction is a rule of the guiding principles underpinning the humane use of animals in scientific research (the three Rs).|$|R

5000|$|Roth {{received}} his orthodontic degree from Loyola University Chicago School of Dentistry. Roth {{was known to}} work well with Dr. Lawrence Andrews. He initially met Dr. Andrews in 1968. During his work, Dr. Andrews gave Roth two sets of his Andrews Straight Wire Brackets for evaluation. Roth believed {{that as long as}} the condyles and mandible were positioned correctly in centric relation, Andrew's six keys to occlusion was compatible for orthodontic treatment. Dr. Andrews had come up with [...] "Andrews Prescription" [...] for the straight-wire brackets he developed. This meant that the <b>orthodontic</b> <b>brackets</b> had pre-adjusted tip and torque built into the brackets.|$|E
50|$|Dental biofilm {{begins to}} {{form on the}} tooth only minutes after brushing. It can be {{difficult}} to see dental plaque on the hard tissue surfaces, however it can be felt as a rough surface. It is often felt as a thick, fur-like deposit that may present as a yellow, tan or brown stain. These deposits are commonly found on teeth or dental appliances such as <b>orthodontic</b> <b>brackets.</b> The most common way dental plaque is assessed is through dental assessment in the dental clinic where dental instruments are able to scrape up some plaque. The most common areas where patients find plaque are between the teeth and along the cervical margins.|$|E
50|$|Retentive clasp {{assemblies}} {{responsible for}} securing interim palatal lift prostheses often {{benefit from the}} development of exaggerated retentive undercuts. Such undercuts can be bilaterally added to the most posterior dental abutments by bonding a bulk of composite resin to the buccal surface of the proposed retainers if they are adult teeth and the surfaces to which the composite resin is to be added are not restored with metallic or ceramic restorative material. When providing supplemental retentive undercuts for interim palatal lift prostheses to be retained by primary teeth or teeth whose buccal surfaces {{have been replaced by}} metallic or ceramic restorative material, the placement of orthodontic bands that harbor large buccal <b>orthodontic</b> <b>brackets</b> can serve {{as an alternative to the}} placement of composite resin.|$|E
30|$|Indeed, {{although}} our {{sample size was}} relatively small, if our measurements were taken as reference values, <b>orthodontic</b> <b>bracket</b> prescription {{would need to be}} altered or bends made in the wire to obtain optimal finishing in the Mozambican population.|$|R
40|$|Orthodontic lingual root {{movement}} (torque) is {{an important}} aspect of treatment biomechanics and is typically achieved by torsion of a rectangular wire within the <b>orthodontic</b> <b>bracket</b> slot which introduces a force couple.

30|$|In {{the attempt}} to {{evaluate}} whether the effect of different concentrations of papain gel prior to <b>orthodontic</b> <b>bracket</b> bonding, the authors' proposal {{in the present study}} was to verify the hypothesis that with the increase in papain gel concentration, the shear bond strength values would be increased.|$|R
50|$|Interim palatal lift {{prostheses}} retentive clasps {{that engage}} undercuts formed with composite resin or <b>orthodontic</b> <b>brackets</b> are fashioned from custom bent orthodontic wire that {{is embedded in}} the polymethylmethacrylate component of the prosthesis. The orthodontic wire extends from the polymethylmethacrylate to engage the gingival aspect of the composite resin or orthodontic bracket serving to provide the prosthesis’ retentive undercut. If the orthodontic wire clasp terminated at its approximation with the dental abutment undercut it engages as do conventional removable partial denture clasps, the interim palatal lift prosthesis could be difficult to insert and remove. Thus, the orthodontic wire clasps used to retain interim palatal lift prostheses are sometimes extended in a mesial direction up to two mesiodistal tooth diameters. Clasps designed in this fashion can be flexed laterally by patients or their caregivers to facilitate the insertion and removal of the interim palatal lift prosthesis.|$|E
30|$|Therefore, {{we suggest}} that nanosilver-coated <b>orthodontic</b> <b>brackets</b> have better tissue {{compatibility}} features than standard <b>orthodontic</b> <b>brackets.</b> Mast cell counts, which were found significantly lower in the study group, support these findings.|$|E
30|$|ICON, Clinpro, and TPSEP {{increased}} enamel {{resistance to}} demineralization. Attempting {{to protect the}} enamel around the <b>orthodontic</b> <b>brackets</b> could be done by applying a preventive material before bonding, if not compromising the bond strength, the <b>orthodontic</b> <b>brackets.</b>|$|E
50|$|The type of {{application}} for glass ionomers depends on the cement consistency as varying levels of viscosity from very high viscosity to low viscosity, can determine whether the cement is used as luting agents, <b>orthodontic</b> <b>bracket</b> adhesives, pit and fissure sealants, liners and bases, core build-ups, or intermediate restorations.|$|R

5000|$|Dr. Robert M. Ricketts (May 5, 1920 - June 17, 2003) was an American {{orthodontist}} {{known for}} many {{contributions in the}} field of orthodontics. Most important contributions were related to his development of Ricketts' Cephalometric Analysis [...] and an [...]018-inch slot in an <b>orthodontic</b> <b>bracket.</b> His research focused on the growth and structural variation of the face and jaws.|$|R
30|$|CPP-ACP and CPP-ACP with {{fluoride}} {{showed no}} {{significant effect on the}} shear bond strength of the <b>orthodontic</b> <b>brackets</b> when bonded with light-cure adhesive. This indicated the safety of these products in caries prophylaxis in orthodontic patients without compromising shear bond strength of the <b>orthodontic</b> <b>brackets.</b>|$|E
30|$|In this study, four nanosilver-coated <b>orthodontic</b> <b>brackets</b> were {{inserted}} in the dorsal region of each rat in the study group. As {{a result of our}} clinical observations, differences considered to be symptoms of argyria were observed in none of the animals. A previous study showed that nanosilver-coated <b>orthodontic</b> <b>brackets</b> prevent caries formation via its antibacterial properties [16]. The present study suggests, with the support of other previous studies, that nanosilver-coated <b>orthodontic</b> <b>brackets</b> have no disadvantage in terms of biocompatibility, and also it can be useful during fixed orthodontic treatment.|$|E
30|$|Attempting {{to protect}} the enamel around <b>orthodontic</b> <b>brackets</b> could be done through {{different}} techniques that each could be effective. This could be by applying a preventive material before bonding the <b>orthodontic</b> <b>brackets</b> or around the brackets after bonding. Regarding the three materials used in the current study, the use of self-etch primers for orthodontic bracket bonding is well documented and has proven not to compromise bond strength [35 – 37]. A previous study which tested the effect of using ICON and Clinpro before bonding <b>orthodontic</b> <b>brackets</b> with self-etch primer and conventional adhesive systems on the shear bond strength found no significant effect [38].|$|E

30|$|The {{severity}} of artifacts mainly {{depends on the}} size, shape, and magnetic susceptibility of the metal of the orthodontic appliance [17].

30|$|The plaque {{retentive}} {{properties of}} the fixed appliances predispose the patient to an increased cariogenic risk [18]. Recently, many authors have advocated CPP-ACP and CPP-ACP-F as the preventive agents for white spot lesions occurring during orthodontic treatment [19, 20]. In present literature, many studies have evaluated the effect of CPP-ACP on the SBS of <b>orthodontic</b> <b>brackets,</b> but very limited studies are conducted to evaluate the effect of combination of these two agents on the SBS of <b>orthodontic</b> <b>brackets</b> [13, 14, 17, 21]. So, {{this study was conducted}} to evaluate the effect of CPP-ACP and CPP-ACP-F on the SBS of <b>orthodontic</b> <b>brackets</b> bonded with two different adhesive systems.|$|E
30|$|Therefore, {{the purpose}} of this {{research}} was to evaluate the effect of CPP-ACP and CPP-ACP with fluoride (CPP-ACP-F) on the shear bond strength (SBS) of <b>orthodontic</b> <b>brackets</b> bonded with two different adhesive systems. The null hypothesis was that pre-treatment with CPP-ACP and CPP-ACP-F would have no effect on the SBS of the <b>orthodontic</b> <b>brackets</b> to enamel with either of the bonding systems.|$|E
30|$|The {{current study}} focused on two {{preventive}} agents Clinpro and ICON. Clinpro is a fluoridated varnish containing 5 % sodium fluoride. Fluoride {{was found to be}} effective in reducing the development of white spot lesions associated with fixed orthodontic treatment [[16],[24]]. Also, ICON resin infiltration was found to decrease the dissolution of enamel and so limit the appearance of white spot lesions [[25]]. When is the proper timing to apply these materials to get the best result of decreasing the white spot lesions around the <b>orthodontic</b> <b>brackets</b> is a worthwhile question. These preventive agents could be applied after bonding the <b>orthodontic</b> <b>brackets,</b> but this may not be easy all the times especially where there are severely crowded or partially erupted teeth. The other option is to apply these materials before bonding the <b>orthodontic</b> <b>brackets,</b> but these preventive agents could {{have an effect on the}} shear bond strength and/or the amount of adhesive left on the teeth after debonding of the <b>orthodontic</b> <b>brackets</b> upon treatment completion.|$|E
30|$|The ongoing {{appliance}} evolution {{resulted in}} two <b>orthodontic</b> <b>bracket</b> sizes that a clinician may choose either 0.018 - or 0.022 -in. slot. The 0.022 -in.-slot size is larger {{as compared to}} 0.018 -in. slot and facilitates easier wire insertion and less frictional binding during initial alignment and provides increased stiffness during retraction. McLaughlin, Bennett and Trevisi (MBT) itself recommends using 0.022 -in. slot and also most of the orthodontists prefer using this slot size, {{so we decided to}} use 0.022 -in. slot brackets for the study.|$|R
30|$|A {{custom-made}} stand {{was used}} to stabilize the teeth for debonding tests. Each tooth was subjected to a shear load in a universal testing machine model DL- 10.000 (EMIC, São José dos Pinhais, Brazil) with a knife-edged blade at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min. The force was applied parallel to the tooth surface {{on top of each}} <b>orthodontic</b> <b>bracket</b> base, and the shear load was recorded at the point of failure. The force per unit area required to dislodge the bracket was then calculated and recorded as the shear bond strength in megapascals (MPa).|$|R
30|$|The {{aim of this}} {{clinical}} investigation was to compare the level of discomfort reported by patients during the removal of <b>orthodontic</b> metallic <b>brackets</b> performed with four different debonding instruments.|$|R
