5|$|After {{graduating from}} Barringer, Berg {{enrolled}} in New York University. He spent two semesters there and played baseball and basketball. In 1919 {{he transferred to}} Princeton University and never again mentioned that he had attended NYU for a year, presenting himself exclusively as a Princeton man. Berg received a B.A., magna cum laude in modern languages. He had studied seven languages: Latin, Greek, French, Spanish, Italian, German and Sanskrit, studying with the philologist Harold H. Bender. His Jewish heritage and modest finances combined to keep him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fringes</b> of Princeton society, where he never quite fit in.|$|E

The Life in a Lens Museum of Photography & Old Times in Matlock Bath presents the history of photography from 1839. Other attractions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fringes</b> of the region include the theme parks at Alton Towers and Gulliver's Kingdom, and the Peak Wildlife Park.|$|E
5|$|After {{serving in}} World War II, Loxton was demobilised and {{rose through the}} cricketing ranks to make his {{first-class}} debut in 1946–47. He was an all rounder—a right-handed middle-order batsman and a right-arm fast bowler. During the 1947–48 Australian season, India toured Australia for five Tests, and the home team dominated, taking an unassailable 3–0 series lead after the first four matches. The Australian selectors then {{decided to use the}} Fifth Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground to give opportunities to players <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fringes</b> of the national team to show their capabilities ahead of the 1948 tour of England. Loxton was one of several debutants, and he seized his chance. He scored 80 and took three wickets as an all rounder in the Australian victory, and was rewarded with inclusion in the 17-man touring party.|$|E
5|$|Following {{an injury}} to Marcus Trescothick, Key made his Test debut against India in 2002. He toured Australia during the 200203 Ashes series, where he {{justified}} his selection ahead of a more experienced player. His One Day International debut came in 2003, against Zimbabwe, however he was dropped from both squads shortly after. Injury to Mark Butcher allowed Key back into the England side for the series against the West Indies in 2004. He scored his maiden Test hundred in the first match of the series, which later became his maiden first-class double century as he scored 221. This performance, coupled with the 93 he scored in the third Test, earned him recognition {{as one of the}} five Wisden Cricketers of the Year. Key's last Test matches came during England's tour of South Africa during 200405, where he managed to score 152runs without being consistent, and despite a one-match return during the 2009 ICC World Twenty20, he has remained <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fringes</b> of selection.|$|E

5|$|For {{the next}} four years, Kartik was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fringes</b> of selection. He made his ODI debut in 2002 and had a short stint before being dropped and missing the 2003 Cricket World Cup because of mediocre performance. He was {{recalled}} in late-2003 for limited overs matches and played in around half of India's matches for a six-month period, {{as well as one}} Test after Harbhajan suffered a serious injury. In late-2004 Kartik played in three Tests as India fielded three spinners, and claimed his only man-of-the-match award in Tests against Australia in Mumbai, but was again dropped two matches later. In late 2005, Kartik became a regular member of the ODI team for a few months when the International Cricket Council introduced an experimental rule that allowed one substitute to be used, opening an extra vacancy in the national team. However, Kartik was unable to secure his position in the team and the rule was later revoked. In late 2007, Kartik broke back into the ODI team and took 6/27 in one victory over Australia, but lost form soon after and was again dropped. He has not represented India since then. Aside from domestic cricket, Kartik plays for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League and has been in demand in English county cricket as an overseas player, representing Lancashire, Middlesex, Somerset and Surrey.|$|E
5|$|The area a pride {{occupies}} {{is called}} a pride area, whereas that by a nomad is a range. The males associated with a pride tend to stay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fringes,</b> patrolling their territory. Why sociality – the most pronounced in any cat species – has developed in lionesses {{is the subject of}} much debate. Increased hunting success appears an obvious reason, but this is less than sure upon examination: coordinated hunting does allow for more successful predation but also ensures that non-hunting members reduce per capita calorific intake; however, some take a role raising cubs, who may be left alone for extended periods of time. Members of the pride regularly tend to play the same role in hunts and hone their skills. The health of the hunters is the primary need for the survival of the pride, and they are the first to consume the prey at the site it is taken. Other benefits include possible kin selection (better to share food with a related lion than with a stranger), protection of the young, maintenance of territory, and individual insurance against injury and hunger.|$|E
5|$|Uxbridge Football Club was {{provided}} {{with the use of}} the station stadium from 1923 and played evening matches there. Ten barrack blocks designed by A. Gilpin were built around the parade ground in 1925, as was the RAF officers' hospital and the original Operations Room, controlled by the Fighting Area of Air Defence of Great Britain (ADGB). The Air Ministry chose RAF Uxbridge as the new base for ADGB on 14 January 1926 owing to its proximity to Whitehall. The site had the added advantage of lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fringes</b> of London and therefore difficult for an enemy to locate and bomb. Having also housed a gymnasium, the lecture hall building became the station cinema in 1927, initially for the use of station personnel only but soon opened to the general public. On 1 March 1929, the headquarters of the Observer Corps was established at Hillingdon House; Air Commodore Edward Masterman was appointed its first commandant. The Observer Corps remained at RAF Uxbridge until 1 March 1936, when it transferred to RAF Bentley Priory.|$|E
