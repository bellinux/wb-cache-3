And, you know, if my success means that other presses will {{take a second look}} at these writers... and publish them in larger numbers, then <b>our</b> <b>ship</b> will come in.|$|E
500|$|The {{crew of the}} USS Bainbridge, the Arleigh Burke-class {{guided missile}} {{destroyer}} which participated in the rescue of Richard Phillips from the hijacked MV Maersk Alabama, contacted the creators of South Park to commend them on the episode. Ensign Jonathan Sieg, the Bainbridge public relations officer, wrote: [...] "Pretty much everyone onboard <b>our</b> <b>ship</b> — from Captain to seaman — is {{a huge fan of}} South Park, and when we heard about the episode Fatbeard, as you can imagine, we were thrilled and very interested to watch." [...] Sieg requested copies of the episode because the streaming online video was difficult to watch on the ship, and the South Park staff in return sent them a care package including several copies of the episode. On the official South Park Studios FAQ, they wrote back, [...] "No, sir, thank you. We were honored to read that, and making an episode about you kicking pirate booty was our pleasure." ...|$|E
500|$|... d. [...] Lucas {{described}} {{the scene on}} Redoutable: In less {{than half an hour}} <b>our</b> <b>ship</b> had been so fearfully mauled that she looked like little more than a heap of debris. Judging by appearances, no doubt, the Temeraire, now hailed us to surrender and not prolong a useless resistance. My reply was instantly to order some soldiers who were near me to fire back; which they did with great alacrity. At the same moment almost, the main mast of the Redoutable fell on board the English ship. The two topmasts of the Temeraire then came down, falling on board of us. Our whole poop was stove in, helm rudder and stern post all shattered to splinters, all the stern frame, and the decks shot through. All our own guns were either smashed or dismounted by the broadsides of the Victory and the Temeraire...The hull itself was riddled, shot through from side to side; deck beams were shattered, port lids torn away or knocked to pieces. Four of our six pumps were so damaged as to be useless. The quarter-deck ladders were broken, which rendered communication {{with the rest of the}} ship very difficult. Everywhere the decks were strewn with dead men, lying beneath the debris. Out of a crew of 634 men we had 522 hors de combat; of whom 300 were killed and 222 wounded nearly all the officers among them... The batteries and upper decks were practically abandoned – bare of men and were unable longer to offer any resistance. No one who had not seen the state of Redoutable could ever form an idea of her awful condition. Really I know of nothing on board that had not been hit by shot.|$|E

"Only {{during the}} Cuban missile crisis in 1962, US {{aircraft}} and other NATO countries have made 1300 provocative overflights of <b>our</b> (Soviet) <b>ships.</b> Their ships, maneuvering {{in close proximity}} to <b>our</b> <b>ships,</b> provoked collisions and 75 times made attempts to stop <b>our</b> <b>ships</b> for their inspection in the open seas." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{should have}} added, that we careened and cleaned <b>our</b> <b>ships</b> here, and put {{ourselves}} into a posture for whatever adventures might happen; for as I resolved upon a trading voyage upon {{the coast of}} Chili and Peru, and a cruising voyage also, as it might happen, so I resolved also to put <b>our</b> <b>ships</b> into a condition for both, as occasion should present.|$|R
500|$|McCain {{was almost}} killed on board Forrestal on July 29, 1967. [...] While the air wing was {{preparing}} to launch attacks, a Zuni rocket from an F-4 Phantom accidentally fired across the carrier's deck. [...] The rocket struck either McCain's A-4E Skyhawk or one near it. The impact ruptured the Skyhawk's fuel tank, which ignited the fuel and knocked two bombs loose. [...] McCain later said, [...] "I thought my aircraft exploded. Flames were everywhere." [...] McCain escaped from his jet by climbing out of the cockpit, working himself to {{the nose of the}} jet, and jumping off its refueling probe onto the burning deck. His flight suit caught on fire as he rolled through the flames, but he was able to put it out. [...] He went to help another pilot trying to escape the fire when the first bomb exploded; McCain was thrown backwards ten feet (three meters) and suffered minor wounds when struck in the legs and chest by fragments. McCain helped crewmen throw unexploded bombs overboard off the hangar deck elevator, then went to Forrestals ready room and with other pilots watched the ensuing fire and the fire-fighting efforts on the room's closed-circuit television. The fire killed 134sailors, injured scores of others, destroyed at least 20aircraft, and took 24hours to control. [...] In Saigon a day after the conflagration, McCain praised the heroism of enlisted men who gave their lives trying to save the pilots on deck, and told New York Times reporter R. W. Apple, Jr., [...] "It's a difficult thing to say. But now that I've seen what the bombs and the napalm did to the people on <b>our</b> <b>ship,</b> I'm not so sure that I want to drop any more of that stuff on North Vietnam." [...] But such a change of course was unlikely; as McCain added, [...] "I always {{wanted to be in the}} Navy. I was born into it and I never really considered another profession. But I always had trouble with the regimentation." ...|$|E
