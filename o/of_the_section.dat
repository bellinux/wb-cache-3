5|$|East Tilbury, {{which stands}} at the western end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>section</b> of the Thames known as Lower Hope Reach, was {{fortified}} long before the building of Coalhouse Fort due to its vulnerability to seaborne attackers. Settlements {{on both sides of}} the Thames were raided by the French in 1379 during the second phase of the Hundred Years' War. The attack prompted the building of Cooling Castle on Kent's Hoo Peninsula between 1380 and 1385 but there was initially no corresponding move to improve the defences of East Tilbury.|$|E
5|$|Few {{buildings}} are {{left on the}} north side of the highway. The most notable are the wooden Southern Pacific saltbox-style section house and workers' bunkhouse, both built in 1887.

5|$|In a study {{published}} in 2008, Nina Rønsted and colleagues analysed the DNA sequences from the nuclear ribosomal internal and external transcribed spacers (ITS and ETS), and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3pdh) region, in the first molecular analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>section</b> Malvanthera. They found F. obliqua to be most closely related to three species of the arid Northern Territory (F. platypoda, F. subpuberula and F. lilliputiana) and classified it in a new series Obliquae in the subsection Platypodeae. The species had remained a transitional rainforest species while its relatives radiated into dryer regions.|$|E

Relationships are unclear and it is uncertain into which direction the group radiated (into rainforest or into arid Australia).|$|E

I.saliceticola was first described in 2009, and within the genus Inocybe, the species is a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>section</b> Marginatae. The species has been recorded in Finland and Sweden and is relatively common in some areas.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{chemistry}} {{has been observed}} only {{for the first three}} members of the group. The chemistry of rutherfordium is not very established and therefore the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>section</b> deals only with titanium, zirconium, and hafnium. All the elements of the group are reactive metals with a high melting point (1668°C, 1855°C, 2233°C, 2100°C?). The reactivity is not always obvious due to the rapid formation of a stable oxide layer, which prevents further reactions. The oxides TiO2, ZrO2 and HfO2 are white solids with high melting points and unreactive against most acids.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary {{engineering}} {{and a final}} tunnel design was completed by {{a joint venture between}} AECOM and Arup. The first phase was originally supposed to include a core tunneling section between 62nd and 92nd Streets, as well as a spur from Third Avenue/63rd Street to Second Avenue/65th Street. The 96th Street station cavern, as well as existing tunnels, would allow the first phase's trackage to run from 62nd to 105th Streets. Before construction started, the MTA revised their plans so that the construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>section</b> between 62nd and 65th Streets was postponed.|$|E
