40|$|The article {{analyses}} {{theoretical and}} methodological problem <b>of</b> hidden <b>curriculum</b> at school. It compares individualistic and holistic approach in connection to research, measurement and analysis <b>of</b> hidden <b>curriculum.</b> The goal <b>of</b> {{the study is}} to present the inconsistency in understanding and explaining the concept <b>of</b> hidden <b>curriculum.</b> The inconsistency {{is grounded in the}} absence of paradigmatical background. The theories <b>of</b> hidden <b>curriculum</b> are devided into two groups. The first group is grounded in individualistic approach and the second group is grounded in holistic approach. The examples of empirical studies are used as tools to grasp hidden curriculum at school. The study concludes that the deϐinitions and understanding of the concept <b>of</b> hidden <b>curriculum</b> are logical conclusions of methodologicalapproach and empirical investigation <b>of</b> hidden <b>curriculum</b> in research. The methodological approach and empirical investigation reversely constitute the theory <b>of</b> hidden <b>curriculum.</b> The individualistic paradigm grasps hidden curriculum as a an implicit socialization of a child through the actions of individuals in the school. The holistic paradigm understands hidden curriculum as institutionalized nature of ideology or the tool for reproduction of society...|$|R

The population of the study contained 330 pre-service information technologies teachers attending to various higher education institutions in Turkey in the spring term of 2008 - 2009 academic years. For data collection, the questionnaire for the “Evaluation of the Appropriateness <b>of</b> the <b>Curriculum</b> <b>of</b> the Course of Information Technologies” was developed by three researchers, then 227 preservice teachers, out of 330, completed the questionnaire, thus % 73 rate of return was accomplished.

Subsequently, the Oklahoma State University System was created, with the Stillwater campus as the flagship institution and several outlying branches: OSU-Institute of Technology in Okmulgee (1946), OSU-Oklahoma City (1961), OSU-Tulsa (1984), and the Center for Health Sciences also in Tulsa (1988).|$|E

The 58% of kindergartens that are private accounted for 77% of all children enrolled. In addition to kindergartens, there exists a well-developed system of government-supervised day-care centers (保育園 hoikuen), supervised by the Ministry of Labor. Whereas kindergartens follow educational aims, preschools are predominantly concerned with providing care for infants and toddlers. Just as there are public and private kindergartens, there are both public and privately run preschools. Together, these two kinds of institutions enroll well over 90 percent of all preschool-age children prior to their entrance into the formal system at first grade. The Ministry of Education's 1990 Course of Study for Preschools, which applies to both kinds of institutions, covers such areas as human relationships, health, environment, language, and expression. Starting from March 2008 the new revision <b>of</b> <b>curriculum</b> guidelines for kindergartens as well as for preschools came into effect.|$|E
