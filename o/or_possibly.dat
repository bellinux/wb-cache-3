5|$|Some of {{the most}} {{destructive}} hurricanes in U.S. history have impacted Texas. A hurricane in 1875 killed about 400 people in Indianola, followed by another hurricane in 1886 that destroyed the town. These events allowed Galveston to take over as the chief port city. The 1900 Galveston hurricane subsequently devastated that city, killing about 8,000 people <b>or</b> <b>possibly</b> as many as 12,000. This makes it the deadliest natural disaster in U.S. history.|$|E

Clarke reviewed the final manuscript in early March 2008, just days before he died.|$|E
