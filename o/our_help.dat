25|$|Isaac Watts the younger, born in Southampton in 1674, {{wrote the}} words of the hymn O God <b>Our</b> <b>Help</b> in Ages Past. His early {{education}} was at the Free Grammar School. He {{was a member of the}} Above Bar Independent Community. This non-conformist community was persecuted following the Act of Uniformity of 1662. Isaac Watts' father, also named Isaac, suffered periods of imprisonment in the Bargate.|$|E
25|$|The {{crisis in}} health and welfare {{services}} in our nation today highlights for NASW what {{many of us have}} been stressing for a long time: inherent in the responsibility for leadership in social welfare is responsibility for professional action. They are not disparate aspects of social work but merely two faces of the same coin to be spent on more and better services for the people who need <b>our</b> <b>help.</b> It is out of our belief in this broad definition of responsibility for social welfare that NASW is taking leadership in the efforts to reorder our nation's priorities and future direction, and is calling on social workers everywhere to do the same.|$|E
25|$|We {{acknowledge}} to You, O Lord, that You are our God, as You {{were the}} God of our ancestors, forever and ever. Rock of our life, Shield of <b>our</b> <b>help,</b> You are immutable from age to age. We thank You and utter Your praise, {{for our lives}} that are delivered into Your hands, and for our souls that are entrusted to You; and for Your miracles that are with us every day and for your marvelously kind deeds that are of every time; evening and morning and noon-tide. Thou art good, for Thy mercies are endless: Thou art merciful, for Thy kindnesses never are complete: from everlasting we have hoped in You. And for all these things may Thy name be blessed and exalted always and forevermore. And all the living will give thanks unto Thee and praise Thy great name in truth, God, our salvation and help. Selah. Blessed be Thou, O Lord, Thy name is good, and to Thee it is meet to give thanks.|$|E

500|$|In 1942, {{members of}} the British Parliament characterised the {{campaign}} in Greece as a [...] "political and sentimental decision". Eden rejected the criticism and argued that the UK's decision was unanimous and asserted that the Battle of Greece delayed Operation Barbarossa, the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union. This is an argument that historians used to assert that Greek resistance {{was a turning point}} in World War II. According to film-maker and friend of Adolf Hitler Leni Riefenstahl, Hitler said that [...] "if the Italians hadn't attacked Greece and needed <b>our</b> <b>help,</b> the war would have taken a different course. We could have anticipated the Russian cold by weeks and conquered Leningrad and Moscow. There would have been no Stalingrad". Despite his reservations, Brooke seems also to have conceded that the Balkan Campaign delayed the offensive against the Soviet Union.|$|E
500|$|Clarke's tenure {{marked a}} {{difference}} in policy: {{instead of trying to}} divide and rule and undermine the power of the hereditary chiefs, he granted considerable authority to them. He applied a similar approach to that of his previous work in Basutoland. His view was that the native people were [...] "better able to manage their own affairs than we can do it for them, though they need <b>our</b> <b>help</b> in international matters and in matters between white and black." [...] He gave special judicial functions to Hlubi of the Basotho, Mehlokazulu of the Ngobese and Mpiyakhe of the Mdlalose, enabling them to try certain cases referred to them by Resident Magistrates. In 1895, according to Harriette Colenso, the Zulu people approved of direct rule with Clarke as Resident Commissioner. However, when Clarke was appointed Resident Commissioner in Rhodesia in 1898, Charles Saunders replaced him and he bowed to pressure from settlers and officials to minimise Dinuzulu's influence over the Zulu people, especially during the Second Boer War.|$|E

As such, they deserve our respect. And <b>our</b> <b>help.</b> Who will plead for them if we are silent?"

Later the same month, publication of statistics showed 2,380 {{people died in}} a 3-year period shortly after a work capability assessment declared them fit for work leading Jeremy Corbyn to call for Duncan Smith's resignation. At his party's conference in October 2015, Duncan Smith {{said in a speech}} about the sick and disabled “we won’t lift you out of poverty by simply transferring taxpayers’ money to you. With <b>our</b> <b>help,</b> you’ll work your way out of poverty,” and criticised the current system [...] which he said [...] "makes doctors ask a simplistic question: are you too sick to work at all?

2500|$|The United States lobbied {{against the}} {{resolution}} {{being brought to}} the UNGA, while Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman {{said that it was}} only exacerbating the situation and that a vote would trigger [...] "an extreme response from us." [...] However, following Operation Pillar of Defense, and under pressure from the United States, Israel stopped its threats of punishment to Abbas for going ahead with the move to the UN. Lieberman also went to New York City to meet Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, while Ambassador Ron Prosor was scheduled to speak after Abbas. Israeli former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert wrote: [...] "I believe that the Palestinian request from the United Nations is congruent with the basic concept of the two-state solution. Therefore, I see no reason to oppose it. Once the United Nations will lay the foundation for this idea, we in Israel will have to engage in a serious process of negotiations, in order to agree on specific borders based on the 1967 lines, and resolve the other issues. It is time to give a hand to, and encourage, the moderate forces amongst the Palestinians. Abu-Mazen [...] (Mahmoud Abbas) and Salam Fayyad need <b>our</b> <b>help.</b> It's time to give it." [...] There was a rally in support of the Palestinian bid in Tel Aviv's Rothschild Boulevard, which was organised by Gush Shalom, Peace Now, Hadash and Meretz. Former Foreign Ministry director Dr. Alon Liel said: [...] "As of today there is a Palestinian state. As of today we no longer control the life of a nation but the life of a separate state." [...] Former Meretz MK Mossi Raz said: [...] "We call on Lieberman and Netanyahu: It's not too late. Order the ambassador to say 'Israel yes.'" [...] Arab-Israeli singer Mira Awad also performed at the rally and said that she was [...] "happy with Abbas' bid and very sad about the inexplicable refusal to finally give the Palestinian people a chance to move forward." [...] Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard was criticised by Jewish groups for not rejecting the motion; she had initially wished to vote against the measure, but abstained instead due to opposition from her own cabinet and caucus. Netanyahu later downplayed the importance of the vote in saying that [...] "the decision at the United Nations will change nothing on the ground. It will not advance the establishment of a Palestinian state. It will delay it further. No matter how many hands are raised against us there is no power on earth that will cause me to compromise on Israel's security." ...|$|E
