5|$|Garamond is {{the name}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>character</b> in the Wii game Super Paper Mario. He appears {{in the world of}} Flopside (the mirror-image of Flipside, where the game begins). He is a {{prolific}} and highly successful author, unlike his Flipside counterpart, Helvetica (a probable recognition of the relative suitability of the two fonts for use in book typesetting).|$|E
5|$|Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches {{is a book}} {{composed}} by the American folklorist Charles Godfrey Leland that was published in 1899. It contains what he believed was the religious text {{of a group of}} pagan witches in Tuscany, Italy that documented their beliefs and rituals, although various historians and folklorists have disputed the existence of such a group. In the 20th century, the book was very influential {{in the development of the}} contemporary Pagan religion of Wicca. Aradia is also the name <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>character</b> in the webcomic Homestuck, created by Andrew Hussie.|$|E
5|$|Episode 232 of the anime series had a {{defamatory}} depiction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>character</b> that referenced {{a specific}} politician, the current Minister for Government Revitalisation Renhō Murata, {{which resulted in}} the cancellation of its rerun on AT-X. Series supervisor Shinji Takamatsu explained that TV Tokyo cancelled the rerun on its own. Renhō's representative denied having objected to the episode although a report from the Mainichi Shimbun paper stated the affected party contacted TV Tokyo. When the story arc the episode belonged to was completed, Takamatsu expressed doubts about the arc's release in DVD format.|$|E
50|$|Willpower: <b>a</b> measure <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>character's</b> {{self-confidence}} and determination, and determines the size <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>character's</b> Temporary Willpower pool. In the Storytelling System, it {{is equal to}} Resolve + Composure, unless it has been temporarily lowered, in which case it can be bought back with experience. In the Storyteller System, Willpower is rated from 1 to 10, and the method <b>of</b> calculating <b>a</b> <b>character's</b> base Willpower rating varies by game line.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> measure <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>character's</b> {{common sense}} and/or spirituality. Wisdom often {{controls}} <b>a</b> <b>character's</b> ability to cast certain spells, communicate to mystical entities, or discern other characters' motives or feelings.|$|R

5|$|For {{her role}} in the film Sophie's Choice (1982), Streep spoke both English and German with a Polish accent, as well as Polish itself. In The Iron Lady, she {{reproduced}} the vocal style of Margaret Thatcher from the time before Thatcher became Britain's Prime Minister, and after she had taken elocution lessons to change her pitch, pronunciation, and delivery. Streep has commented that using accents as part of her acting is a technique she views as an obvious requirement in her portrayal <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>character.</b>|$|E
5|$|His films also {{typically}} {{end with}} a death, which is portrayed not as a tragedy, but as a happy moving on where the deceased looks down happily at the world below. Between Heaven and Earth ends with a birth, but it is similarly handled the passing <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>character</b> into a new world. This pattern is continued in Mr. Nobody, where two deaths open the film and a unique twist on death {{at the end of}} the film conveys a wistful sense of happiness.|$|E
5|$|In all {{games from}} the second onwards, the player will gain access {{to a series of}} (predominantly 8-bit) minigames, {{sometimes}} randomly after death, as in the second game, and sometimes once the player has completed a specific task. These minigames usually tell a story or event relevant to the game's lore, although mostly presented in a cryptic way. For example, minigames in Five Nights at Freddy's 2 are speculated to portray the homicidal incidents previously mentioned in the games. Minigames in Five Nights at Freddy's 4 tell the story <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>character,</b> possibly the player character, who dies in a tragic accident.|$|E

5|$|Many {{cultures}} {{throughout history}} have viewed obesity {{as the result}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>character</b> flaw. The obesus or fat character in Ancient Greek comedy was a glutton and figure of mockery. During Christian times the food {{was viewed as a}} gateway to the sins of sloth and lust. In modern Western culture, excess weight is often regarded as unattractive, and obesity is commonly associated with various negative stereotypes. People of all ages can face social stigmatization, and may be targeted by bullies or shunned by their peers.|$|E
5|$|Terry George was {{the first}} {{director}} to join the project, and he also did some revisions to the script, but he soon left the project. Peter Berg was the next director to consider, but he too, eventually dropped out for undisclosed reasons. A year later {{it was confirmed that}} Phillip Noyce would direct. Noyce was attracted to Salt for its espionage themes, which are present in most of his filmography, as well as the tension <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>character</b> who tries to prove his innocence yet also does what he was previously accused of.|$|E
5|$|The concept <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>character</b> being confronted at {{a triumphant}} feast with a {{reminder}} of their downfall {{is not unique to}} Shakespeare and may originate from the Belshazzar's feast episode of the Bible. The term 'ghost at the feast' has entered popular culture, and is often used as a metaphor for a subject a person would rather avoid considering, or (considering the general plot of Macbeth) {{a reminder of}} a person's unpleasant past or likely future.|$|E

5|$|The {{conference was}} cut short, however, when news reached Licinius that his rival Maximinus {{had crossed the}} Bosporus and invaded European territory. Licinius {{departed}} and eventually defeated Maximinus, gaining control over the entire {{eastern half of the}} Roman Empire. Relations between the two remaining emperors deteriorated, as Constantine suffered an assassination attempt at the hands <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>character</b> that Licinius wanted elevated to the rank of Caesar; Licinius, for his part, had Constantine's statues in Emona destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Wanting {{readers to}} know that the stone mask and its powers would be what would drive the plot, Araki started the manga with a prologue {{involving}} the mask, focusing on communicating the mood, rather than the standard way of opening a manga with an introduction of the protagonist. The concept of the Hamon power was created as he thought about how to create drawings that show the invisible; he {{came up with the idea}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>character</b> punching a frog, which was left unharmed, while the rock underneath cracked open, thus showing the supernatural power of the character's abilities. It was also influenced by his love for karate manga, with the supernatural moves used within them.|$|E
5|$|When Kukunoor was {{thinking}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>character</b> full of disguises, {{he first came}} up with an old man. When the thought of a scene with the three major characters dancing in the dunes came up, he realized that an older character could not realistically dance in the desert. He immediately felt that Shreyas Talpade, whom he knew of knowing mimicry, could be used for bahuroopiya. Kukunoor, who worked previously with Girish Karnad, said that he was the strength for the film and added that he found him a good actor and a good human being.|$|E
5|$|During the game, {{the player}} {{controls}} the onscreen <b>character</b> from <b>a</b> third-person perspective {{to interact with}} people, objects, and enemies. Like previous games in the series and most role-playing games, characters level up each time they earn <b>a</b> set number <b>of</b> experience points from defeating enemies; each level gained increases the character's statistics, thus improving their performance in battle. Statistic examples include hit points, the amount <b>of</b> damage <b>a</b> <b>character</b> can receive; magic points, which determine the number <b>of</b> times <b>a</b> <b>character</b> can use magical attacks; strength, the power <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>character's</b> physical attacks; and intelligence, the power <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>character's</b> magical spells. Upon encountering an enemy, the player can use <b>a</b> variety <b>of</b> weapons to attack and defeat the enemy. Despite the game being set in 2036, the weapon choices are largely medieval, including swords, axes, and spears, although handguns and a rocket-propelled grenade are available. These weapons differ in their damage output, {{the range of the}} weapon, and the speed of the attack.|$|R

5|$|When {{the book}} edition of The Vicar of Bullhampton {{appeared}} in April 1870, it bore a preface; Trollope, who ordinarily scorned prefaces and dedications, {{felt compelled to}} justify the presentation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>character</b> like Carry Brattle. He reiterated the points he had made regarding Formosa: that while depicting a fallen woman as glamourous or noble might lead impressionable readers to vice, a true depiction of such a woman's misery might deter readers from yielding to temptation; and might soften the hearts of parents whose daughters have fallen, and thus afford an opportunity of returning to decency.|$|E
5|$|Bill Loguidice and Matt Barton of Gamasutra {{commented that}} Robotrons success, along with Defender, {{illustrated}} that video game enthusiasts {{were ready for}} more difficult games with complex controls. Though {{not the first to}} implement it, Robotron: 2084s use of dual joysticks popularized the design among 2D shooting games, and has since been copied by other arcade-style games. The control scheme has appeared in several other titles produced by Midway Games: Inferno, Smash TV, and Total Carnage. Many shooting games on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network use this dual control design. The 2003 title Geometry Wars and its sequels also use a similar control scheme. The input design was most prominent in arcade games until video games with three-dimensional (3D) graphics became popular in the late 1990s. Jarvis attributes the lack of proliferation in the home market to the absence of hardware that offered two side-by-side joysticks. Most 3D games, however, use the dual joystick scheme to control the movement <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>character</b> and a camera. Few console games, like the 2004 title , use two joysticks for movement and attacking.|$|E
5|$|Dates {{are also}} {{relevant}} to this autobiographical reading. According to the text, Pym arrives at the island of Tsalal on January 19 — Poe's birthday. Scholars, including Burton R. Pollin and Richard Wilbur, suggest that the character of Augustus was based on Poe's childhood friend Ebenezer Burling or on Poe's brother William Henry Leonard Poe, who served in South America and elsewhere as a sailor aboard the USS Macedonian. In the novel, the date of Augustus's death corresponds {{to that of the}} death of Poe's brother. The first chapter features Pym's sloop named the Ariel, the name <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>character</b> once played by Poe's mother Eliza Poe, and also the name of Percy Bysshe Shelley's boat, on which he died, originally named Don Juan in honor of Lord Byron.|$|E
50|$|Hit points (HP) are <b>a</b> measure <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>character's</b> {{vitality}} or health; {{they are}} determined by the character's class (certain occupations breed hardier people) or race, and Constitution score. Hit points are reduced whenever <b>a</b> <b>character</b> takes damage.|$|R

5|$|Deriving {{from the}} {{concepts}} of tabletop role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons, nearly all roguelikes give the player control <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>character,</b> which they may customize by selecting a class, race, and gender, and adjusting attributes points and skills. At {{the start of the}} game, the character is placed at the top-most level of a dungeon, with basic equipment such as a simple weapon, armor, torches, and food. Following along the role-playing concept of a dungeon crawl, the player moves the character through the dungeon, collecting treasure which can include new weapons, armors, magical devices, potions, scrolls, food, and in-game money, while having to fight monsters that roam the dungeon. Most combat is performed simply by attempting to move the character into the same space as the monster, which the game then calculates the damage that the character and monster deal. Other types of attacks, such as firing an arrow or performing an offensive magic spell, can often be performed as well.|$|E
5|$|Many {{important}} events occur off-camera {{and there is}} no artificial exposition in the form of voice-over or flashbacks, with the exceptions of two flashbacks – one {{at the end of the}} pilot episode that replays a moment from earlier in the same episode and one at the end of the fourth season finale that shows a short clip <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>character</b> tutoring his younger brother earlier in the season. Thus, the viewer needs to follow every conversation closely to understand the ongoing story arc and the relevance of each character to it. Salon.com has described the show as novelistic in structure, with a greater depth of writing and plotting than other crime shows. Each season of The Wire consists of between ten and thirteen episodes which form several multi-layered narratives. Simon chose this structure with an eye towards long story arcs that draw a viewer in, which then results in a more satisfying payoff. He uses the metaphor of a visual novel in several interviews, describing each episode as a chapter, and has also commented that this allows a fuller exploration of the show's themes in time not spent on plot development.|$|E
5|$|Sheng Long is a {{character}} hoax related to the Street Fighter series, created by Electronic Gaming Monthly (EGM) as an April Fools' prank in 1992 (in an issue published mid-February). The joke, based upon a mistranslation that suggested the existence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>character</b> named Sheng Long in the Capcom fighting game Street Fighter II, described a method to fight the character in the game. After other publications reprinted the details as fact without verifying the authenticity, the Sheng Long hoax spread worldwide. As a result of discussion revolving around {{the possibility of the}} character's appearance in Street Fighter III during the game's development, EGM revisited the joke in 1997, printing an updated version of the hoax for the title while establishing a backstory and appearance for the character in the process.|$|E
