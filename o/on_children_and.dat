Since its establishment, more than 20,000 {{children and}} their family members in the Portland metropolitan area have benefited from The Dougy Center, free of charge. Support groups are offered in Canby, Hillsboro, and Portland. In 2004, 140 volunteer facilitators donated more than 10,500 hours {{of service to the}} center. The organization employs a staff of around fifteen individuals, and is supported by an advisory board and board of directors.|$|E
5|$|In the US, {{as in the}} UK, the Hicklin test of {{obscenity}} applied, but New York {{case law}} had established that books should be judged by their effects on adults rather than <b>on</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> that literary merit was relevant. Ernst obtained statements from authors including Dreiser, Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Sinclair Lewis, Sherwood Anderson, H. L. Mencken, Upton Sinclair, Ellen Glasgow and John Dos Passos. Besides, freedom of expression was protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. To make sure these supporters did not go unheard, he incorporated their opinions into his brief. His argument relied on a comparison with Mademoiselle de Maupin by Théophile Gautier, which had been cleared of obscenity in the 1922 case Halsey v. New York. Mademoiselle de Maupin described a lesbian relationship in more explicit terms than The Well did. According to Ernst, The Well had greater social value because it was more serious in tone and made a case against misunderstanding and intolerance.|$|E

25|$|After the war, {{these crimes}} were tried at {{what became known}} as the Doctors' Trial, and revulsion at the abuses perpetrated led to the {{development}} of the Nuremberg Code of medical ethics. The Nazi physicians in the Doctors' trial argued that military necessity justified their torturous experiments, and compared their victims to collateral damage from Allied bombings. But this defense, which was in any case rejected by the Tribunal, cannot apply to the twin experiments of Josef Mengele, which were performed <b>on</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> had no connection to military necessity.|$|E
25|$|Only 15% of {{high school}} {{students}} are admitted to college in China, so the entrance exams are fiercely competitive and those who do enter university graduate at a rate of 99%. Much pressure is put <b>on</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> adolescents to study and be able to attend college and this pressure is a central school counseling focus in China. An additional stressor is that there are not enough places for students to attend college, and over 1/3 of college graduates cannot find jobs, so career and employment counseling and development are central in school counseling.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the social}} mores {{represented}} in the show, a happy marriage {{is the cornerstone of}} successful middle-class family life, and June and Ward represent the warm, happily married, successful middle class couple. In contrast, the parents of Beaver's friend Larry Mondello are a husband frequently out of town on business and an exasperated wife struggling single-handedly to raise a son and sometimes depending on Ward to help discipline him. Singles like prim Aunt Martha and globe-trotting, yarn-spinning Uncle Billy are shown as either out-of-touch and irksome or untrustworthy. The one episode dealing with divorce shows it as having negative effects <b>on</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> family life.|$|E
25|$|A {{meta-analysis}} of 208 experiments {{found that the}} mere-exposure effect is robust and reliable, with an effect size of r=0.26. This analysis found that the effect is strongest when unfamiliar stimuli are presented briefly. Mere exposure typically reaches its maximum effect within 10–20 presentations, and some studies even show that liking may decline after a longer series of exposures. For example, people generally like a song more after they have heard it a few times, but many repetitions can reduce this preference. A delay between exposure and the measurement of liking actually tends to increase {{the strength of the}} effect. The effect is weaker <b>on</b> <b>children,</b> <b>and</b> for drawings and paintings as compared to other types of stimuli. One social psychology experiment showed that exposure to people we initially dislike makes us dislike them even more.|$|E
