However, safe passage and anchoring of boats are allowed as long as fishing gear are not deployed. In the Cape Falcon Shoreside MPA (Falcon Cove sandy beach) only fishing from the beach is allowed.

30|$|Studies on the {{formation}} of memory have recently concentrated on the possible role of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) (Cull-Candy et al. 2001; Dingledine et al. 1999; Hua and Smith 2004; Waxman and Lynch 2005). The NMDARs are ligand-gated iontropic glutamate receptors that are important mediators for neuronal events such as synaptic plasticity, learning and memory, neuronal development, and circuit formation. They have been implicated in various neuronal disorders (Cull-Candy et al. 2001; Dingledine et al. 1999; Hua and Smith 2004; Waxman and Lynch 2005). NMDARs are heteromers comprising two obligate NMDARs and two NR 2 (NR 2 A-D) or NR 3 subunits (NR 3 A-B) (Cull-Candy and Leszkiewicz 2004). Teleost NMDARs have been cloned from knifefish (Apteronotus leptorpynchus), rainbow trout (O. mykiss), and zebrafish (Danio rerio) (Bottai et al. 1997; Harvey-Girard and Dunn 2003; Cox et al. 2005; Kinoshita et al. 2005).

40|$|Abstract: With climate change, {{scientists}} {{and others are}} interested in the future of Pacific salmon in the Arctic. Chum, pink, sockeye, coho, and chinook salmon have been encountered in the Beaufort Sea, well within Canadian Arctic waters. Chum is the <b>only</b> <b>salmon</b> species regarded as natal to the Mackenzie River watershed, although both pink and chum salmon appear to be natal to Alaska’s North Slope rivers. It is not possible to say whether apparent recent increases in the frequency of occurrence of salmonids in the Arctic is an effect of climate change, but it appears there are either increases in the survival of natal fish from the Mackenzie, or in the wandering of non-natal fish to the Mackenzie, or both. We propose three hypotheses to explain how chum salmon survive cold marine winter conditions, and thereby persist in the North American Arctic: (1) Bering Sea Refuge – young salmon migrate to the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska where they remain until they are ready to return to spawn; (2) Atlantic Layer Beaufort Refuge – salmon remain in the Beaufort Sea, wintering offshore deep under pack ice; and (3) Freshwater Beaufort Refuge – salmon remain in the Beaufort Sea region, wintering in the brackish, under-ice Mackenzie River plume or in fresh water adjacent to the Beaufort Sea. As a preliminary test of these hypotheses, we examined the strontium-to-calcium ratios (Sr:Ca) of otoliths from chum salmon from the Colville (Alaska’s North Slope) and Tanana (Yukon River drainage) rivers. Yukon River chum salmon were assumed t...|$|R

40|$|Sea lice are {{regarded}} as having the most commercially damaging effect on cultured salmon {{in the world with}} major economic losses to the fish farming community resulting per annum (Bristow and Berland, 1991; Jackson and Costello, 1991). They affect salmon in a variety of ways; by reducing fish growth; by causing loss of scales, which leaves the fish open to secondary infections (Wootten et al., 1982); and by damaging the fish, which reduces its marketability. The two species of sea lice found on cultured salmonids in Ireland are Caligus elongatus Nordmann, a species of parasite that infests over 80 different types of marine fish, and Lepeophtheirus salmanis Kroyer, which infests <b>only</b> <b>salmon</b> and other salmonids. L. salmonis is regarded as the more serious parasite of the two species and has been found to occur most frequently on farmed salmon (Jackson and Minchin, 1992). Most of the damage caused by these parasites is thought to be mechanical, carried out during the course of attachment and feeding (Kabata, 1974; Brandal et al., 1976; Jones et al., 1990). Inflammation and hyperplasia (enlargement caused by an abnormal {{increase in the number of}} cells in an organ or tissue) have been recorded in Atlantic salmon in response to infections with L. salmonis (Jones et al., 1990; Jonsdottir et al., 1992; Nolan et al., 2000). Increases in stress hormones caused by sea lice infestations have been suggested to increase the susceptibility of fish to infectious diseases (MacKinnon, 1998). Severe erosion around the head caused by heavy infestations of L. salmonis has been recorded previously (Pike, 1989; Berland, 1993). This is thought to occur because of the rich supply of mucus secreted by mucous cell-lined ducts in that region (Nolan et al., 1999). In experimental and field investigations carried out in Norway heavy infestation was found to cause fish mortalities (Finstad et al., 2000) ...|$|R
