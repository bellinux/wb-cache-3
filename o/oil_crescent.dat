50|$|The Gulf of Sidra Offensive was an {{offensive}} of the Second Libyan Civil War. It was {{launched by the}} Benghazi Defense Brigades on 3 March 2017, and has so far resulted in them taking control of a strip of coastal territory between the towns of Nofaliya and Ras Lanuf, which was then {{handed over to the}} Government of National Accord. A number of significant oil ports are located in this area, sometimes referred to as the <b>Oil</b> <b>Crescent.</b> The loss of the <b>Oil</b> <b>Crescent</b> has been perceived by analysts as a major blow to the power of Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar.|$|E
50|$|On 9 March, after obtaining {{endorsement}} from tribal {{elders in}} Benghazi, the LNA launched a counteroffensive in the <b>Oil</b> <b>Crescent,</b> with armoured brigades {{being sent to}} the area. The following day, it was reported that airstrikes had targeted Sidra and Ras Lanuf, and that heavy fighting had broken out in Uqayla, a small town located on the frontline.|$|E
50|$|Fall of Bin Jawad (2016) {{refers to}} ISIL {{takeover}} of Libyan city of Bin Jawad on 04 January 2016 during its <b>oil</b> <b>crescent</b> region. On Monday morning, the terrorist group imposed full {{control over the}} city of Bin Jawad in the Sirte District, {{after a series of}} intense firefights with rebel forces that are loyal to the Libyan provisional government in Tripoli.|$|E

5000|$|As Governor, he {{negotiated}} with the Emirati <b>oil</b> companies, <b>Crescent</b> Petroleum and Dana Gas to develop Anbar's Akkas gas field. The companies promised to create 100,000 jobs, and Fahadawi asked Prime Minister al-Maliki to by-pass the usual Oil Ministry tendering process to award the contract to these two companies. Opponents accused him of corruption, controlling how business contracts are awarded, {{with the head of}} the US Provincial Reconstruction Team saying that [...] "accountability and transparency were at variance" [...] with the expectations of Anbar's leaders.|$|R
5|$|Raphel was {{instrumental}} in coordinating the State Department's establishment of diplomatic relations with the Taliban shortly after its takeover of Kabul. A senior Unocal executive commented that the pipeline project would be far easier to implement with the Taliban in control, {{in reference to the}} need for central control in Afghanistan to undertake a project of the size, complexity and cost the Texas-based oil giant was considering. Unocal's consortium also included Saudi Arabia's Delta <b>Oil,</b> Pakistan's <b>Crescent</b> Group and Gazprom of Russia. The project involved building an 890-kilometer gas pipeline that would carry 1.9 billion cubic feet of gas to Pakistan each day. Unocal held detailed discussions with Taliban representatives in Houston in December 1997, striking a deal that would later collapse under the weight of rising U.S. and Afghan domestic political pressures against the Taliban's record on human rights, education and treatment of women.|$|R
5000|$|Emerson’s second {{commission}} {{was for the}} post office and courthouse in Grand Junction, Colorado. The Harvest (7’x 9’ <b>oil</b> on <b>crescent</b> shaped canvas) was completed and installed in 1940. The Harvest depicts a young man and woman working together harvesting peaches, symbolizing “the richness that came to the land following the introduction of irrigation”, [...] with a water wheel in the background. Barbara Melosh, in her book Engendering Culture: Manhood and Womanhood in New Deal Public Art and Theatre, describes this frequently used Section theme as the “comradely ideal”. She writes, “Louise Ronnebeck invokes the comradely ideal in the image of shared labor, and she emphasizes the physicality of work in the man’s muscled arms and the woman’s sturdy figure”. [...] Similar to her Wyoming mural, the man and the woman are equals, working towards a common goal. The mural depicts the Ute Indians leaving the valley on the right side and the white settlers, pushing them out from the left. The theme of displacement is effective and evocative of the time and the changes that had occurred and continued to occur in the West.|$|R
50|$|The first project {{handled by}} Crescent was the Mubarek Field {{off the coast}} of UAE. Within 13 months from the discovery, it was on full {{production}} at a rate of over 60,000 barrels of oil per day, with the drilling of three additional wells, the installation of the processing platform, an additional well-head platform, export loading terminal, and associated support structures and pipelines. This was a world record at the time for bringing an offshore field on-stream from <b>oil</b> discovery. <b>Crescent</b> Petroleum has also earned several operational world records including the deepest short radius horizontal section drilled, and the deepest slim hole to be cased by expandable casing. Since the start of production in 1974, the Mubarek Field has undergone several development phases. The initial phase of the development of Ilam/Mishrif oil reservoir, at a depth of 3800 m was completed in 1977. Development of the Thamama gas condensate reservoir, at a depth of 4700 m, was started in 1987 for production of the gas and condensate. A central gas processing facility was established in the early 1990s, and gas export to Jebel Ali through a 150 km offshore pipeline was constructed. In late 2005, the company commenced a program of drilling further infill wells to increase production of petroleum.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{a method}} for {{evaluating}} the kinematic flow rate of a <b>crescent</b> <b>oil</b> pump is presented. The procedure also allows calculating the angular derivatives of the delivery, suction and trapped volumes of the pump, which are the prerequisites for the simulation of the unit using a lumped parameters approach. The method {{is based on the}} knowledge of the length of the vector rays between the centres of the gears and the contact points. From the volume derivatives, an analytic expression of the pump displacement and of the kinematic flow ripple index is obtained. Moreover, the same formula can also be applied to external gear machines. Finally, in this study the influence of the number of teeth of the driving and driven gears has been assessed. The increase of the number of teeth of the inner gear is beneficial; both for the reduction of the flow ripple and for the increase of the displacement at equal overall pump size...|$|R

He was {{one of the founders of}} the Automobile Club of America and in 1904 became one of it 2 ̆ 7 s first presidents. He was the President of the N. Y. Medical College 2 ̆ 6 Hospital for Women; Chairman to the Executive Committee at N. Y. Orthopedic Dispensary; and President of the Board of Trustees at Barnard College. He was the attorney for Lone Star and <b>Crescent</b> <b>Oil</b> Company of New Orleans, which at the time had made the largest contract for oil out of Texas with the United Gas Improvement Company of Philadelphia. He was also one of the attorneys for the New York and Port Chester Railroad Company, and manager of the Morris Park Racing Association. He was a lover of horse racing and bred horses; he also managed the Morris Park Racing Association. Morris was musically inclined and played the violin. [URL]...|$|R
