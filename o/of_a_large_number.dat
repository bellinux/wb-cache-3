5|$|The total {{complement}} of proteins present {{at a time}} in a cell or cell type is known as its proteome, and the study of such large-scale data sets defines the field of proteomics, named by analogy to the related field of genomics. Key experimental techniques in proteomics include 2D electrophoresis, which allows the separation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> of proteins, mass spectrometry, which allows rapid high-throughput identification of proteins and sequencing of peptides (most often after in-gel digestion), protein microarrays, which allow the detection of the relative levels <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> of proteins present in a cell, and two-hybrid screening, which allows the systematic exploration of protein–protein interactions. The {{total complement}} of biologically possible such interactions is known as the interactome. A systematic attempt to determine the structures of proteins representing every possible fold is known as structural genomics.|$|E
5|$|Unlike many {{of their}} Asian counterparts, Filipinos do not eat with chopsticks; they use Western cutlery. However, {{possibly}} due to rice being the primary staple food and the popularity <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> of stews and main dishes with broth in Filipino cuisine, the main pairing of utensils seen at the Filipino dining table is that of spoon and fork, not knife and fork.|$|E
5|$|Although Exmoor {{witnessed}} the construction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> of monuments during the Bronze Age, only two stone circles survive in this area, the other being Porlock Stone Circle. The Withypool ring {{is located on}} the south-western slope of Withypool Hill, on an area of heathland. In diameter it measures 36.4 metres (119 feet, 6 inches) across. Around thirty small gritstones remain as part of the circle, which may originally have held around one hundred; there are conspicuous gaps on the northern and western ends of the monument. The site was rediscovered in 1898 and subsequently surveyed by the archaeologist Harold St George Gray in 1905.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1960s and {{continuing}} {{in the next two}} decades, the university saw the construction and modernization <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> of facilities and the construction of the library, science building, residence halls and the University center. Many new programs and majors were inaugurated, as were important social outreach efforts. New ties were established with the private and industrial sectors, and a growing partnership developed with federal and state governments in creating programs for the economically and educationally disadvantaged.|$|E
5|$|British {{palaeontologist}} David Bruce Norman has stressed how remarkable {{it is that}} Owen, {{who previously}} had propounded that dinosaurs were active quadrupedal animals, largely neglected Scelidosaurus though it {{could serve as a}} prime example of this hypothesis and its fossil {{was one of the most}} complete dinosaurs found at that time. Norman explained this by Owen's excessive workload in this period, including several administrative functions, polemics with fellow-scientists and the study <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> of even more interesting newly discovered extinct animals, such as Archaeopteryx. Norman also pointed out that Owen in 1861 suggested a lifestyle for Scelidosaurus that is very different from present ideas: it would have been a fish-eater and partially sea-dwelling.|$|E
5|$|By {{the mid-1980s}} {{closure of the}} {{stations}} was being considered, and in 1984, was considered for a {{combined heat and power}} scheme. After the privatisation of the Central Electricity Generating Board in 1989, the stations passed into the ownership of National Power. After almost 37 years of use they were decommissioned in May 1991 as outdated and uneconomical to operate. They had been overtaken technologically, and had lower generating capacity than newer plants such as Drax. Their closure coincided with that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> of coal mines in the North East of England, just after the privatisation of both the electricity industry and the National Coal Board in the early 1990s.|$|E
50|$|This technology, {{utilized}} {{in both the}} Powerwave and Primawave, generates a fluid pressure pulse that causes a momentary elastic flexure of the pore structure. This pressure pulse moves fluid in and out <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> pore networks, obtaining a more uniform injection front.|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, it {{was shown}} that all these {{differential}} scale-space interest point detectors defined from the Hessian matrix allow for the detection <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> interest points and better matching performance compared to the Harris and Shi-and-Tomasi operators defined from the structure tensor (second-moment matrix).|$|R

5|$|E. coli {{encompasses}} {{an enormous}} population of bacteria that exhibit {{a very high}} degree of both genetic and phenotypic diversity. Genome sequencing <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> of isolates of E. coli and related bacteria shows that a taxonomic reclassification would be desirable. However, {{this has not been}} done, largely due to its medical importance, and E. coli {{remains one of the most}} diverse bacterial species: only 20% of the genes in a typical E. coli genome is shared among all strains.|$|E
5|$|In 1800, {{an illegitimate}} son, Simon, Jr., by Brazilian slave buyer Rebecca Ousten, was later named {{prominently}} {{in his will}} which was taken to court by the legitimate heirs; but, the will stood. In 1801, the second <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> of slave exchanges took place between Favre and Ousten {{as he prepared to}} marry Celeste Rochon. Favre and Rochon wed on March 25, 1801, his first legal marriage, and by Rochon he had daughters Augustine Rochon and Luisa Farve of Mobile.|$|E
5|$|Kinetic models {{describe}} the particle velocity distribution function at each {{point in the}} plasma and therefore {{do not need to}} assume a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. A kinetic description is often necessary for collisionless plasmas. There are two common approaches to kinetic description of a plasma. One is based on representing the smoothed distribution function on a grid in velocity and position. The other, known as the particle-in-cell (PIC) technique, includes kinetic information by following the trajectories <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> of individual particles. Kinetic models are generally more computationally intensive than fluid models. The Vlasov equation may be used to {{describe the}} dynamics of a system of charged particles interacting with an electromagnetic field.|$|E

5|$|Lepidoptera {{have two}} large, {{immovable}} compound eyes which consist <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> of facets or lenses, each {{connected to a}} lens-like cylinder which {{is attached to a}} nerve leading to the brain. Each eye may have up to 17,000 individual light receptors (ommatidia) which in combination provide a broad mosaic view of the surrounding area. One tropical Asian family, the Amphitheridae, has compound eyes divided into two distinct segments. The eyes are usually smooth but may be covered by minute hairs. The eyes of butterflies are usually brown, golden-brown or even red {{as in the case of}} some species of skippers.|$|E
5|$|Most of Paine's {{arguments}} {{had long}} been available to the educated elite, but by presenting them in an engaging and irreverent style, he made deism appealing and accessible to a mass audience. Originally distributed as unbound pamphlets, the book was also inexpensive, putting it within the reach <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> of buyers. Fearing the spread of what they viewed as potentially revolutionary ideas, the British government prosecuted printers and book-sellers who tried to publish and distribute it. Nevertheless, Paine's work inspired and guided many free thinkers.|$|E
5|$|Several methods {{exist for}} the {{calculation}} of Taylor series <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> of functions. One can attempt to use {{the definition of the}} Taylor series, though this often requires generalizing the form of the coefficients according to a readily apparent pattern. Alternatively, one can use manipulations such as substitution, multiplication or division, addition or subtraction of standard Taylor series to construct the Taylor series of a function, by virtue of Taylor series being power series. In some cases, one can also derive the Taylor series by repeatedly applying integration by parts. Particularly convenient is the use of computer algebra systems to calculate Taylor series.|$|E
50|$|Color {{quantization}} {{is frequently}} combined with dithering, which can eliminate unpleasant artifacts such as banding that appear when quantizing smooth gradients {{and give the}} appearance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> colors. Some modern schemes for color quantization attempt to combine palette selection with dithering in one stage, rather than perform them independently.|$|R
