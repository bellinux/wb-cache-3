5|$|Protecteur was {{decommissioned}} at {{a farewell}} ceremony on 14 May 2015. Plans for replacing Protecteur {{and her sister}} ship, Preserver, were first brought up in 2004. Lack <b>of</b> <b>spare</b> parts for the ship's boiler {{and the fact that}} she is a single-skinned tanker were the main driving points to replacing Protecteur and Preserver.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} May 1941, the NDH had asked Germany for, among other things, 22 Messerschmitt Bf 109s. Instead, they {{got some of}} the {{remaining}} largely obsolete aircraft of the VVKJ. At the same time, Germany appropriated six captured Dornier Do 17K bombers, which were then supplied to Bulgaria. Romania received six ex-VVKJ Hawker Hurricanes, as well as six Bristol Blenheims, whilst Finland received 20 half-completed Blenheims, together with manufacturing tools and production equipment, as well as a huge variety <b>of</b> <b>spare</b> parts.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, three {{production}} Su-27Ms {{were delivered}} to the air force's 929th State Flight-Test Centre (GLITs) at , Akhtubinsk, to perform weapons trials. In 2001, the air force decided to transfer several Su-27Ms to re-equip the Russian Knights aerobatics team, and so the team's pilots took familiarisation flights with the aircraft. The three production and two other pre-production Su-27Ms arrived at the team's Kubinka air base near Moscow in 2003. However, they were used as a source <b>of</b> <b>spare</b> parts for other aircraft in the demonstration fleet.|$|E
50|$|NASA has {{two basic}} types <b>of</b> <b>spares,</b> {{development}} spares and operational spares. NASA makes a determination about which parts needs spares {{based on whether}} parts are custom built, and the lead-time for procurement; and makes determinations about quantities <b>of</b> <b>spares</b> based on whether the part is critical to system operation, failure rate, and the expected life of the part.|$|R

25|$|During the Sino-Indian War of 1962, the C-119 was {{extensively}} {{used for}} supply of Indian forces. President Kennedy allowed sales <b>of</b> <b>spares</b> <b>of</b> C-119 on priority basis upon request by the Indian government.|$|R
5|$|In February 2009, President Barack Obama asked Secretary of Defense Robert Gates about {{placing the}} project on hold or {{canceling}} it because of its high cost: over $13billion for the planned 28 helicopters. In June 2009, the U.S. Navy terminated the contract after spending about $4.4 billion and taking delivery of nine VH-71s. In {{the aftermath of the}} cancellation, the delivered helicopters were sold onto Canada for $164 million, where they were used as a source <b>of</b> <b>spare</b> parts for its fleet of AgustaWestland CH-149 Cormorant search-and-rescue helicopters.|$|E
5|$|Paul Jacobi was {{ultimately}} allotted to France in early 1946 and renamed Desaix. She became operational later that year, but her service with the French Navy was fairly brief, with only cruises to French colonies in Africa during 1947 of note {{before she was}} paid off in late 1948 and placed in reserve in early 1949. The ship {{was used as a}} source <b>of</b> <b>spare</b> parts of the other ex-German ships in French service until she was condemned and sold for scrap in 1954.|$|E
5|$|The T-26 mod. 1931 did {{not have}} a radio set. The tank {{commander}} communicated with the driver by speaking tube, which was replaced with a signalling lamp in 1932. The T-26 was equipped with one fire extinguisher, a kit <b>of</b> <b>spare</b> parts tools and accessories (including a tank jack), a canvas stowage, and a tow chain fixed on the rear of the hull.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} an approach based on {{particle swarm optimization}} (PSO) for determining the optimal allocation <b>of</b> <b>spares</b> as well as repair resources while satisfying a desired availability constraint. The proposed method expands the original PSO algorithm to handle stochastic constraints and discrete decision variables. Computational {{results show that the}} proposed approach is efficient for determining the optimal choice <b>of</b> <b>spares</b> and repair channels for multiechelon repairable-item inventory systems...|$|R
5000|$|Some <b>of</b> <b>Spare's</b> techniques, {{particularly}} {{the use of}} sigils {{and the creation of}} an [...] "alphabet of desire" [...] were adopted, adapted and popularized by Peter J. Carroll in the work Liber Null & Psychonaut. Carroll and other writers such as Ray Sherwin are seen as key figures in the emergence <b>of</b> some <b>of</b> <b>Spare's</b> ideas and techniques {{as a part of a}} magical movement loosely referred to as chaos magic.|$|R

5|$|The most {{important}} factor that negatively affects maintenance is the low and irregular pay that soldiers receive, resulting in the theft and sale <b>of</b> <b>spare</b> parts and even basic equipment to supplement their meager salaries. When not stealing spare parts and equipment, maintenance personnel often spend {{the better part of}} their duty day looking for other ways to profit. American maintenance teams working in Zaire found that providing a free lunch to the work force was a good, sometimes the only, technique to motivate personnel to work {{at least half of the}} duty day.|$|E
5|$|This unorthodox {{deployment}} {{gave the}} Smith Gun 360 degrees of rotation which, {{combined with a}} maximum 40-degree elevation, produced a basic firing-plate-mounted field weapon light enough to be towed behind a civilian vehicle, despite not being designed for this. (Home Guard units quickly discovered this fact, having to be prohibited from doing so as it would damage the weapon's wheels (and possibly the axle), inhibiting or even preventing traverse.) Happily, ammunition shortages made the similarly-constructed limber redundant and so a source <b>of</b> <b>spare</b> parts.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the urging}} of his crewmen, Choe changed his clothes in a ritual fashion in {{preparation}} for death, although he prayed to the heavens to spare him and his crew, asking what sins they had committed to deserve this fate. On the sixth day, during fairer weather, their ship came upon a group of islands in the Yellow Sea where Chinese pirates were moored. The pirates robbed their ship <b>of</b> <b>spare</b> goods and rations, threw away the Koreans' oars and anchor, and left them to drift aimlessly into the sea.|$|E

5|$|Aircrew {{training}} {{using the}} F-4Es began {{three days after}} the aircraft first arrived at Amberley. The aircraft were initially operated as a pool controlled by No.82 Wing (the parent headquarters for No.1 and No.6 Squadrons) and were allocated between the two squadrons only after all the Phantoms, aircrew and ground crew had arrived in Australia. The training program gradually increased in complexity, with night flying beginning in October, practice-bombing sorties commencing in late November and air-to-air sorties being flown from January 1971. Ground attack missions were practiced from February 1971, and in June that year the Phantoms began dropping live bombs during exercises. The introduction of several of the aircraft into service was delayed by an initial shortage <b>of</b> <b>spare</b> parts, but all were operational by the end of 1970.|$|E
5|$|By 1962, Congress {{had passed}} {{legislation}} to deny financial aid grants to Yugoslavia, {{to withdraw the}} sale <b>of</b> <b>spare</b> parts for Yugoslav warplanes, and to revoke the country's most favored nation status. Kennan strongly protested the legislation, arguing that it would only result in a straining of relations between Yugoslavia and the U.S. Kennan came to Washington {{during the summer of}} 1962 to lobby against the legislation but was unable to elicit a change from Congress. President Kennedy endorsed Kennan privately but remained noncommittal publicly, as {{he did not want to}} jeopardize his slim majority support in Congress on a potentially contentious issue. With U.S.–Yugoslav relations getting progressively worse, Kennan tendered his resignation as ambassador during late July 1963.|$|E
5|$|For a while, the calutrons {{suffered}} {{from a series of}} debilitating breakdowns and equipment failures, exacerbated by a shortage <b>of</b> <b>spare</b> parts. Hopes that the Alpha II racetracks would be more reliable soon faded, as they were plagued by insulator failures. These problems were gradually overcome. The first shipments of enriched uranium to the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory were made in March 1944, consisting of Alpha product enriched to 13 to 15 percent uranium-235. While of no use in a bomb, it was urgently required for experiments with enriched uranium. The last shipment of Alpha product was made on 11 May 1944. On 7 June 1944, Y-12 made its first delivery of weapons-grade Beta product, enriched to as high as 89% uranium-235.|$|E

5|$|In August 2007, the Lebanese Armed Forces {{planned to}} put its Hunters back into service {{following}} the 2007 Lebanon conflict, to deal with Fatah al-Islam militants in the Nahr el-Bared camp north of Tripoli. The programme was delayed by lack <b>of</b> <b>spare</b> parts for the aircraft, such as cartridges for the Martin-Baker ejection seats. On 12 November 2008, 50 years after its original introduction, the Lebanese Air Force returned four of its eight Hunters to service with 2nd Squadron, based at Rayak AB: one two-seater and three single-seaters. Military exercises were conducted with Hunters, {{such as those that}} took place on 12 July 2010. The Hunters were retired from service during 2014.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} address the {{shortcomings}} of the RNZAF's Skyhawk fleet, the New Zealand Government approved the Project Kahu program in May 1985. This project had a total cost of NZ$140 million, and primarily involved upgrading the A-4G and A-4Ks' avionics to almost the standard of those fitted to the modern General Dynamics F-16C Fighting Falcon. The Skyhawks also received new wings drawn from the stock <b>of</b> <b>spare</b> parts purchased from the RAN in 1984. Work began on the first aircraft in 1986, and the program was completed in 1991. After receiving the Kahu upgrade package the A-4Gs were re-designated A-4Ks.|$|E
5|$|The 747 has {{redundant}} structures {{along with}} four redundant hydraulic systems and four main landing gears with four wheels each, which {{provide a good}} spread of support {{on the ground and}} safety in case of tire blow-outs. The main gear are redundant so that landing can be performed on two opposing landing gears if the others do not function properly. In addition, the 747 has split control surfaces and was designed with sophisticated triple-slotted flaps that minimize landing speeds and allow the 747 to use standard-length runways. For transportation <b>of</b> <b>spare</b> engines, 747s can accommodate a non-functioning fifth-pod engine under the port wing of the aircraft between the inner functioning engine and the fuselage.|$|E

50|$|Two {{cortical}} processes run alongside {{each other}} when barrel cortex is deprived of sensory input from some whiskers to produce representational plasticity. In deprived cortex, neuronal responses to spared whiskers are enhanced and responses to deprived whiskers are weakened. These two processes have different time courses, with the weakening of deprived response preceding the strengthening <b>of</b> <b>spared</b> response, implying that they have different underlying mechanisms. These two effects combine to produce {{an expansion of the}} cortical representation <b>of</b> <b>spared</b> whiskers into the representation of adjacent deprived whiskers.|$|R
5|$|The Australian Government is {{planning}} to sell the Hornets and associated spare parts after the type is retired from RAAF service. In August 2017 the Canadian Government initiated discussions to purchase a number of Australian F/A-18s to augment the Royal Canadian Air Force's fleet of similar McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornets {{in the event that}} a planned purchase of Super Hornets does not proceed. A Canadian delegation also visited Australia that month to inspect RAAF Hornets. An article in Australian Aviation stated that it is unclear whether Canada would use the aircraft operationally or as a source <b>of</b> <b>spare</b> parts. The Canadian Government lodged a formal expression of interest to purchase Australian F/A-18s on 29 September 2017. A response from the Australian Government is expected by the end of 2017.|$|E
5|$|The RAAF's MirageIII pilots {{generally}} {{found the}} process of converting to the Hornet to be straightforward. While the F/A-18 {{was considered to be}} easier to fly, its more sophisticated avionics and weapons systems required improved cockpit workload management skills. The Hornets have also proven to be mechanically reliable and easy to maintain, though shortages <b>of</b> <b>spare</b> parts reduced availability rates {{during the early years of}} their service with the RAAF. The updates installed as part of the HUG process have further simplified maintenance procedures. In recent years, however, the aging aircraft have required much more servicing than was the case in the past.|$|E
5|$|When the war ended, {{it was not}} {{expected}} that the inefficient Little Boy design would ever again be required, and many plans and diagrams were destroyed. However, by mid-1946 the Hanford Site reactors were suffering badly from the Wigner effect. Faced {{with the prospect of}} no more plutonium for new cores and no more polonium for the initiators for the cores that had already been produced, Groves ordered that a number of Little Boys be prepared as an interim measure until a cure could be found. No Little Boy assemblies were available, and no comprehensive set of diagrams of the Little Boy could be found, although there were drawings of the various components, and stocks <b>of</b> <b>spare</b> parts.|$|E
