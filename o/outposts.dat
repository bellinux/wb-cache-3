5|$|In March 1952, {{the corps}} grew in {{size as the}} 25th Infantry Division was {{relieved}} from its command and it gained command of 1st British Commonwealth Division and the South Korean 1st Division, 8th Division, and 9th Divisions. In June 1952, a ten-day attack against 45th Infantry Division <b>outposts</b> was repulsed. September 1952 began with renewed enemy attacks against the <b>outposts</b> that protected the main line. Enemy attacks up to regimental size against garrisons of platoon and company strength were turned back by Corps troops. <b>Outposts</b> at Bunker Hill, The Hook, Kelly, Old Baldy Hill, Nori, and Pork Chop Hill were defended in heavy fighting within I Corps' area of responsibility. All along the front, the enemy was driven back with thousands of casualties.|$|E

While there is some tourism there, Norwegian authorities limit access to the outpost to minimize impact on the scientific work. Ny-Ålesund has a winter population of 35 and a summer population of 180. The Norwegian Meteorological Institute has <b>outposts</b> at Bjørnøya and Hopen, with respectively ten and four people stationed. Both <b>outposts</b> can also house temporary research staff.

Their plans included expeditions from West Florida to take New Orleans and other Spanish targets, including several expeditions {{to gain control of}} targets in the Upper Mississippi, such as the small town of St. Louis. The expedition from West Florida never got off the ground because Bernardo de Gálvez, the Governor of Spanish Louisiana, moved rapidly to gain control of British <b>outposts</b> on the Lower Mississippi and threatened action against West Florida's principal <b>outposts</b> of Mobile and Pensacola.|$|E

5|$|The game {{world is}} divided into two halves: North and South Kyrat. Players start in South Kyrat and are free to explore it almost immediately, but can only unlock North Kyrat {{over the course of the}} story. The map is {{progressively}} opened by liberating bell towers, freeing them from Pagan Min's influence and allowing the Golden Path to expand. These towers help players reveal new areas and mark new locations of interest on the map. The world is scattered with <b>outposts</b> controlled by Pagan Min, which can be infiltrated by players. Four larger <b>outposts,</b> or fortresses, can also be found, and feature stronger defenses and more difficult combinations of enemies. If players successfully liberate these <b>outposts,</b> they will serve as fast-travel points, allowing quick navigation through the game's world. Additional missions and quests also become available. There are many side-missions that can be completed, including hostage rescues, bomb disposal quests, and hunting missions. The collected animals' parts can then be used for crafting new pouches and belts.|$|E
5|$|The next day, {{they moved}} to the left flank in the north to relieve the Royal Naval Brigade. Their {{trenches}} stretched from the sea to Walkers Ridge and included two <b>outposts,</b> No.1 Post and No.2 Post. The regiment took over on the extreme right, with one squadron in the front line, one squadron in the support trench and the third squadron as the reserve. Next in line to their right, was the Auckland Mounted Rifles, and then the Wellington Mounted Rifles on the left. However, the regiment {{had to wait until}} it got dark before sending men forward to man the two <b>outposts.</b>|$|E

50|$|More than 88,000 {{rounds of}} Chinese {{artillery}} fell on <b>Outpost</b> Harry.

Five UNC companies, four US and one Greek, took turns in defending the <b>outpost.</b>|$|R
5|$|General William Howe {{had taken}} his army from New York City by sea on a {{campaign}} to capture Philadelphia instead of moving north to meet Burgoyne. Most of Burgoyne's Indian support had fled following the loss at Bennington, and his situation was becoming difficult. He needed to reach defensible winter quarters, requiring either retreat back to Ticonderoga or advance to Albany, {{and he decided to}} advance. He then deliberately cut communications to the north so that he would not need to maintain a chain of heavily fortified <b>outposts</b> between his position and Ticonderoga, and he decided to cross the Hudson River while he was in a relatively strong position. He ordered Baron Riedesel, who commanded the rear of the army, to abandon <b>outposts</b> from Skenesboro south, and then had the army cross the Hudson just north of Saratoga between September 13 and 15.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the Franco-Spanish expedition, Carolinians led Native American raiding expeditions that besieged Pensacola, {{one of the few}} remaining Spanish <b>outposts</b> in Florida. They also mobilized Native American forces to attack Mobile, but these efforts were frustrated by French diplomatic activities in the Native American communities and also by false rumors of another Franco-Spanish expedition.|$|E
5|$|Scott's Wabash Campaign was well-received both in Kentucky {{and by the}} Washington administration. On June 24, 1791, Arthur St. Clair {{encouraged}} the Board of War to organize a second expedition into the Wabash region and to remove their <b>outposts</b> along the Ohio River to free up manpower and finances {{as a prelude to}} his larger invasion. Scott questioned the wisdom of removing the <b>outposts</b> and convinced his fellow members of the Board of War to retain one at Big Bone Lick and one guarding an ironworks {{at the mouth of the}} Kentucky River. His instincts later proved to be right; a month later, Indian raiders tried to deny the frontier settlers access to salt by capturing Big Bone Lick, but they were repelled by the militia stationed at the outpost there. Scott also did not believe that 500 men, St. Clair's requested number for the second Wabash expedition, was sufficient for an effective operation.|$|E

5|$|The British {{commander-in-chief}} in North America, Lieutenant General Sir George Prevost, had forbidden any offensive {{action on}} the Niagara Frontier.

The regular troops were distributed among the defensive <b>outposts</b> and supplemented with militia and Native American forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} on the <b>outposts</b> continued; the 7th Infantry Division stopped wave after wave of troops that the Chinese threw against Pork Chop Hill. Troops of the Turkish Brigade, attached to the 25th Infantry Division, defended <b>Outposts</b> Berlin, Vegas, Carson, and Elko in fierce hand-to-hand combat. They were ordered to evacuate all but the Berlin position {{at the end of}} May. The 1st British Commonwealth Division ejected the Chinese after their assault on the Hook. The 1st ROK Division troops were ordered off the positions on Queen, Bak, and Hill 179 when heavy enemy assaults divested them of their tactical value. The closing days of the fighting saw the 7th Infantry Division withdrawn from Pork Chop and the 1st Marine Division ordered to evacuate the Berlin positions for the same reason.|$|E

5|$|After Abraham Lincoln's {{election}} as president, several Southern states announced their secession from the Union {{to form a}} new government, the Confederate States of America. Garfield read military texts while anxiously awaiting the war effort, which he regarded as a holy crusade against the Slave Power. In April 1861, the rebels bombarded Fort Sumter, one of the last federal <b>outposts</b> in the South, beginning the Civil War. Although he had no military training, Garfield knew that his place was in the Union Army.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the smoke}} the commanders of the second line of Polish <b>outposts</b> {{could not see the}} {{approaching}} Russians and did not open fire. Contrary to the battle plan, the second line did not send reinforcements to the first. This was particularly important in the case of Forts 54 and 56, as they had to face the enemy alone, without the support of Forts 21, 22 and 23 behind them. The most important positions in the suburb of Wola received only token reinforcements from the main reserve and were forced to fight in isolation.|$|E
5|$|By the 19th century, European {{colonialism}} in Africa {{had reached}} its height. Having {{lost control of}} the vast territory of Brazil in South America, the Portuguese began to focus on expanding their African <b>outposts.</b> This brought them into direct conflict with the British. Since David Livingstone had returned to the area in 1858 in an attempt to foster trade routes, British interest in Mozambique had risen, alarming the Portuguese government. During the 19th century, much of Eastern Africa was still being brought under British control, and in order to facilitate this, Britain required several concessions from the Portuguese colony.|$|E

5000|$|When the {{shelling}} subsided small-arms fire {{could be heard}} from the central hall, Zidover, Funk and four other Golani soldiers {{came out to the}} fighting platform through the upper western opening. They saw dozens of Syrian soldiers advancing on the road toward the <b>outpost</b> gate and a covering force lying on the embankment outside the <b>outpost</b> fence. Of the three machine guns, two were out of action after {{the shelling}}. Lacking fighting positions, the <b>outpost</b> commander and the infantrymen opened fire with a machine gun and their personal weapons. The Syrians were surprised by the fire and halted. The machine gunner was killed and the <b>outpost</b> sergeant took the weapon over. The <b>outpost</b> commander realized that ammunition was low and went down to the central hall to contact the 820th Brigade commander, Colonel Zvi Barazani. He explained the situation and asked him to [...] "fire on our outposts". Barazani approved and the 334th Battalion commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Aryeh Schwartz, accepted the mission. The Golani soldiers kept firing at the Syrians and prevented them from entering the <b>outpost</b> until approximately 15:45, when the Israeli shelling began. At this point Barazani ordered the <b>outpost</b> commander to shut his men in the <b>outpost</b> until the shelling was over and break out only on his command. Due to a misunderstanding, the soldiers did not leave the <b>outpost</b> and continued defending its openings from within.|$|R
