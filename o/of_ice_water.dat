25|$|As an example, {{for a glass}} <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> <b>water</b> in air at room temperature, the {{difference}} in temperature between a warm room (the surroundings) and cold glass of ice and water (the system and {{not part of the}} room), begins to equalize as portions of the thermal energy from the warm surroundings spread to the cooler system of ice and water. Over time the temperature of the glass and its contents and the temperature of the room become equal. In other words, the entropy of the room has decreased as some of its energy has been dispersed to the ice and water.|$|E

25|$|Tim McCarver ran {{afoul of}} Atlanta Braves outfielder Deion Sanders during the 1992 postseason, {{when he made}} {{comments}} on-air criticizing Sanders for his two-sport athletic career; Sanders was playing for both the Braves and the NFL's Atlanta Falcons {{at the time and}} participated in both the baseball postseason and the early NFL regular season {{for the first time in}} 1992 (Sanders was unable to do this in 1991, as his NFL contract with the Falcons would not allow him to).

500|$|The {{cause of}} Zachary Taylor's death has been fully {{established}} in 2001. On July 4, 1850, Taylor {{was known to}} have consumed copious amounts <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> <b>water,</b> cold milk, green apples, and cherries after attending holiday celebrations and the laying of {{the cornerstone of the}} Washington Monument. That same evening, he became severely ill with an unknown digestive ailment. Doctors used popular treatments of the time. Taylor died in the White House at 10:35p.m. on July 9, five days after becoming ill. Contemporary reports listed the cause of death as [...] "bilious diarrhea, or a bilious cholera". He was succeeded by Vice President Millard Fillmore.|$|E
2500|$|In 19th century Parisian cafés, upon {{receiving}} {{an order for}} an absinthe, a waiter would present the patron with a dose of absinthe in a suitable glass, sugar, absinthe spoon, and a carafe <b>of</b> <b>iced</b> <b>water.</b> It {{was up to the}} patron to prepare the drink, as the inclusion or omission of sugar was strictly an individual preference, as was the amount of water used. [...] As the popularity of the drink increased, additional accoutrements of preparation appeared, including the absinthe fountain, which was effectively a large jar <b>of</b> <b>iced</b> <b>water</b> with spigots, mounted on a lamp base. This let drinkers prepare a number of drinks at once—and with a hands-free drip, patrons could socialise while louching a glass.|$|R

2500|$|Following {{trends in}} fashion and Text Speak, New Media also makes way for [...] "trendy" [...] social change. The Ice Bucket Challenge {{is a recent}} example of this. All {{in the name of}} raising money for ALS (the lethal {{neurodegenerative}} disorder also known as Lou Gehrig's disease), participants are nominated by friends via Facebook, Twitter and ownmirror to dump a bucket <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> <b>water</b> on themselves, or donate to the ALS Foundation. This became a huge trend through Facebook's tagging tool, allowing nominees to be tagged in the post. The videos appeared on more people's feeds, and the trend spread fast. This trend raised over 100 million dollars for the cause and increased donations by 3,500 percent.|$|E

40|$|We use {{observations}} from the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) {{of the north}} polar cap during late summer for two Martian years, to monitor the complete summer cycle <b>of</b> albedo and <b>water</b> <b>ice</b> grain size in order to place quantitative limits of the amount <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>ice</b> deposited in late summer. We establish {{here for the first}} time the complete spring to summer cycle <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>ice</b> grain sizes on the north polar cap. The apparent grain sizes grow until Ls= 132, when they appear to shrink again, until they are obscured at the end of summer by the north polar hood. Under the assumption that the shrinking of grain sizes is due to the deposition <b>of</b> find grained <b>ice,</b> we quantify the amount <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>ice</b> deposited per Martian boreal summer, and estimate the amount <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>ice</b> that must be transported equatorward. Interestingly, we find that the relative amount <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>ice</b> deposited in the north cap during boreal summer (0. 7 - 7 microns) is roughly equivalent to the average amount <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>ice</b> deposited on the south polar cap during austral summer (0. 6 - 6 microns).
