5|$|A 1982 {{consent decree}} split the American Telephone & Telegraph Company {{monopoly}} into several entities with local service providers {{becoming part of}} a Regional Bell <b>Operating</b> <b>Company.</b> In the decade that followed, AT erected new buildings across the country including the AT Building in New York City. April 5, 1985, AT issued a request for proposals that produced eleven respondents.

5|$|About 40 {{years after}} {{nationalisation}} British Rail was privatised {{and the old}} name was revived by Great Western Trains, the train <b>operating</b> <b>company</b> providing passenger services on the old GWR routes to South Wales and the South West, which subsequently became First Great Western {{as part of the}} FirstGroup but in September 2015 changed its name to Great Western Railway in order to 'reinstate the ideals of our founder'. The operating infrastructure, however, was transferred to Railtrack and has since passed to Network Rail. These companies have continued to preserve appropriate parts of its stations and bridges so historic GWR structures can still be recognised around the network.|$|E

[...] or [...] "U S WEST Communications, Inc.", to unify their corporate image. To this day, the only remaining Baby Bell that has not renamed its <b>operating</b> <b>companies</b> is AT&T, formerly SBC Communications. Since 2001, there have only been 17 of the original 22 Bell <b>Operating</b> <b>Companies,</b> following the mergers of U S WEST's and BellSouth's <b>operating</b> <b>companies</b> and reincorporation of Southwestern Bell.

5|$|In 2003, Aspmyra Næringseiendom {{converted}} its debt, then NOK20.5 million, to Swiss francs. Because of the transaction, {{within a}} year the company's debt had increased by 10 percent. In 2004, the stadium ownership company {{changed its name to}} Aspmyra Stadion AS. The municipality eliminated the stadium company's debt of NOK5.5 million to the municipality in November 2005. This allowed the club's <b>operating</b> <b>company</b> to have a positive share capital and the club was thus allowed to keep its license. In May 2006, the grass pitch was replaced with artificial pitch, costing NOK3.1 million. The training pitch received new turf in 2007.|$|E
5|$|In March 2011, the East Coast train <b>operating</b> <b>company</b> {{named one}} of its Class 91 {{electric}} locomotives Sir Bobby Robson, unveiled at Newcastle Central Station by his widow Elsie and Alan Shearer.

40|$|We {{examine the}} real effects of parent firm {{diversification}} on their electric utility <b>operating</b> <b>companies</b> over the period, 1990 - 2003. Since electric utility <b>operating</b> <b>companies</b> produce a single homogenous product, we can better measure their Total Factor Productivity and make valid comparisons of productivity across firms. We find that, {{consistent with a}} diversification discount, greater parent diversification is associated with lower productivity across electric utility <b>operating</b> <b>companies.</b> However, the productivity of the electric utility <b>operating</b> <b>companies</b> improves with greater parent diversification over time. Diversification appears to provide an alternative channel to divert investment dollars away from overinvestment in the core electric business. Finally, {{we find that the}} improvement in the productivity of the electric utility <b>operating</b> <b>companies</b> from greater parent firm diversification over time is limited to financially constrained firms. This suggests that when managers have no resources to waste, {{it is more likely that}} any diversification activities are carefully planned and undertaken for strategic purposes that can help to increase productivity of the core business. ...|$|R
50|$|In April 2000, Abbey bought Porterbrook from Stagecoach Group for £773 million.

5|$|Significant change {{occurred}} when the Manchester Ship Canal was opened in 1894. The tidal section of the river below Frodsham now flowed into the ship canal, rather than the River Mersey, and the exit lock from Weston Docks also joined the canal rather than the estuary. A new ship lock was constructed at Weston Marsh, which provided a more convenient route to the ship canal than the alternative route through Weston Point docks. The Weston Canal has been little used since. Although {{it is possible for}} pleasure craft to reach the Weaver from the Ship Canal, it is a commercial waterway, and most leisure users are dissuaded from doing so by the amount of paperwork and the requirements of the <b>operating</b> <b>company.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Australian {{shipping}} {{interests of}} Cunard, Blue Star Line and Ellerman Lines were subsequently formed {{into a separate}} <b>operating</b> <b>company</b> (Associated Container Transportation (Australia)) and following work by Smallpeice, the Australian government allowed the state owned Australian National Line to form a partnership with Associated Container Transportation (Australia). The group {{would go on to}} form the Pacific America Container Express which operated services between Australia and the east coast of North America via the Panama Canal. Smallpeice would serve as chairman of the Associated Container Transportation (Australia)/Australian National Line partnership from its creation in 1969 and as chairman of Associated Container Transportation (Australia) from 1971, retiring from both positions in February 1979.|$|E
5|$|The {{municipality}} {{gave the}} necessary permissions for construction in December 1997, but {{required that the}} club finance the upgrades, which the club could not afford. Kjell Ove Johansen, CEO of Bodø/Glimt's <b>operating</b> <b>company,</b> quit his job in November 1998 in protest against the mayor's and councilors' negative attitude and lack of trust towards Bodø/Glimt regarding the venue plans. On 27 January 1999, the municipal council passed a resolution allowing the venue {{to be sold to}} the club for NOK7.9 million, with the official take-over date being 1 May. In addition, the company would pay NOK5.5 million to the municipality at a later date, after the venue had become profitable.|$|E

5|$|The {{projected}} {{costs of}} the railway line were NOK4.3billion±20%. Total costs ended at NOK7.7 billion, including 1.3billion extra used on extraordinary expenditures on the Romeriksporten. On 1 October 1996 {{it was decided that}} the construction company, NSB Gardermobanen, would also become the operator of the airport express train. However, due to limited profitability with the company, from 1 January 2001 the ownership of Gardermobanen was transferred to the Norwegian National Rail Administration, who also owns the rest of railway lines in Norway. The <b>operating</b> <b>company</b> changed its name to Flytoget AS.|$|E
5|$|After Rolf Skår was {{appointed}} director of NSC, plans were launched {{to try to}} win the ground station contract for NASA's planned Earth Observing System (EOS). NASA was considering locating the ground station in Greenland, at McMurdo Station in Antarctica or at Esrange in Sweden. Skår invited a NASA delegation to visit Svalbard, and from 1996 NSC and NASA started negotiating a contract to establish a ground station at Longyearbyen. The first satellite to use SvalSat was Landsat 7, which was launched on 15 April 1999. NSC bought SSC's ownership in TSS and Lockheed Martin's ownership in SvalSat in 2001. On 1 February 2002, NSC and Kongsberg Spacetec merged their interests in satellite technology and operations into Kongsberg Satellite Station, which became the sole owner of both SvalSat and TSS. Legally, Kongsberg Satellite Services is a continuation of the <b>operating</b> <b>company</b> of TSS. KSAT opened Troll Satellite Station in 2007.|$|E
5|$|From 1845, {{the line}} was {{operated}} by the SER. In 1899, the SER and LCDR entered into a joint working partnership, the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR). On 1 January 1923, the Railways Act 1921 came into force, resulting in the Grouping. The SECR {{became part of the}} Southern Railway (SR). On 1 January 1948, the Transport Act 1947 came into force, and the SR became part of British Railways, with the former SR lines becoming the Southern Region. British Railways was rebranded British Rail on 1 January 1965. On 10 June 1986, Network SouthEast branded trains began operating. On 1 January 1994, the Railways Act 1993 came into force, privatising British Rail. Passenger services were taken over by Connex South Eastern on 13 October 1996. On 27 June 2003, Connex lost the franchise due to poor financial management. The Strategic Rail Authority took over the running of passenger trains from 9 November 2003, using their South Eastern Trains train <b>operating</b> <b>company.</b> On 1 April 2006, Southeastern took over the operation of passenger trains on the route.|$|E
