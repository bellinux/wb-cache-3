5|$|Immediately {{after the}} Clottey fight, {{negotiations}} began {{to pursue a}} contest against Manny Pacquiao (49-3-2, 38 KOs). Even before Pacquiao defeated Ricky Hatton, Bob Arum, who represents both Cotto and Pacquiao, stated that {{he was interested in}} this matchup. Subsequently, Pacquiao expressed interest in fighting Cotto. The fight was sanctioned as a world title fight in the welterweight division, where the weight limit is 147 pounds, however Cotto's camp agreed to fight at a catchweight of 145 pounds to accommodate Pacquiao's smaller physique. Cotto's camp also conceded the larger share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purse</b> to Pacquiao, who received a 65% share of pay-per-view buys, compared to Cotto's 35% share.|$|E
5|$|The Taplow Club {{gathering}} {{initiated a}} series of several meetings {{over the next several}} months and, on 10 April 1916, the PGA of America was officially established with 35 charter members. Wanamaker proposed that the newly formed organization hold an annual tournament, and offered to donate money for a trophy and prize fund. That October, the first annual PGA Championship took place at the Siwanoy Country Club in Bronxville, New York. James M.

5|$|The {{first two}} rounds were played Thursday and the final two rounds on Friday. Strong's fine results in the {{first two rounds}} put him on 149, tied for second place with Ray, two strokes behind the second round leader, Vardon, who stood at 147. Strong's play was {{remarkable}} for its steadiness, rather than any particular brilliancy, as he methodically hit fairways and greens and seldom found himself in trouble. Strong beat or tied eventual winner Francis Ouimet in rounds 1, 2 and 4. A disappointing third round 82, however, ruined any chance he had to win the tournament and he would eventually finish on 310, +18 to par, for a ninth-place finish. He won $40 as his share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purse.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{struggle}} over the power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purse</b> brought Adams back into the political limelight. Traditionally, the Massachusetts House of Representatives paid the salaries of the governor, lieutenant governor, and superior court judges. From the Whig perspective, this arrangement was an important check on executive power, keeping royally appointed officials accountable to democratically elected representatives. In 1772, Massachusetts learned that those officials would henceforth be paid by the British government {{rather than by the}} province. To protest this development, Adams and his colleagues devised a system of committees of correspondence in November 1772; the towns of Massachusetts would consult with each other concerning political matters via messages sent through a network of committees that recorded British activities and protested imperial policies. Committees of correspondence soon formed in other colonies, as well.|$|E
5|$|The prerogatives and {{authority}} {{granted to the}} legislature within the Constitution meant that it could and would play a major and indispensable role in {{the functioning of the}} government—it was not just a rubber stamp. The General Assembly alone could enact, revoke, interpret and suspend laws under Article13 of the Constitution. The legislature also held the power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purse</b> and was required to annually authorize expenditures and taxes. It alone approved and exercised oversight of government loans and debts. Other responsibilities entrusted to the Assembly included setting the size of the military's forces, the creation of offices within the government, monitoring the national welfare and ensuring that the government was being run in conformity to the Constitution. This last provision allowed the legislature wide authority to examine and debate government policy and conduct.|$|E

5|$|When a drop {{of falling}} water hits the {{interior}} of the cup with the appropriate angle and velocity, the peridioles are ejected into the air by the force of the drop. The force of ejection tears open the purse, and results in the expansion of the funicular cord, formerly coiled under pressure in the lower part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purse.</b> The peridioles, followed by the highly adhesive funicular cord and basal hapteron, may hit a nearby plant stem or stick. The hapteron sticks to it, and the funicular cord wraps around the stem or stick powered by the force of the still-moving peridiole. After drying out, the peridiole remains attached to the vegetation, where it may be eaten by a grazing herbivorous animal, and later deposited in that animal's dung to continue the life cycle.|$|E

25|$|Between 1888 and 1948 various {{difficulties}} that arose in match negotiations led players {{to try to}} define agreed rules for matches, including the frequency of matches, how much or how little say the champion had in the conditions for a title match and what the stakes and division <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purse</b> should be. However these attempts were unsuccessful in practice, as the same issues continued to delay or prevent challenges.|$|E
25|$|Returning to Sweden, Gustav aroused popular indignation {{against the}} mutinous aristocratic officers. Ultimately, he quelled their {{rebellion}} and arrested its leaders. Capitalizing on the powerful anti-aristocratic passions thus aroused, Gustav summoned a Riksdag early in 1789, {{at which he}} put through an Act of Union and Security on 17 February 1789 {{with the backing of}} the three lower estates. This reinforced monarchical authority significantly, although the estates retained the power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purse.</b> In return, Gustav abolished most of the old privileges of the nobility.|$|E
25|$|The Sixteenth Amendment in 1913 {{extended}} congressional {{power of}} taxation to include income taxes without apportionment among the several States, and {{without regard to}} any census or enumeration. The Constitution also grants Congress the exclusive power to appropriate funds, and this power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purse</b> is one of Congress's primary checks on the executive branch. Congress can borrow money on the credit of the United States, regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the states, and coin money. Generally, both the Senate and the House of Representatives have equal legislative authority, although only the House may originate revenue and appropriation bills.|$|E
50|$|Bethea's first {{brush with}} the law was in 1935, when {{he was charged with}} breach <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peace, for which he was fined $20, then in April <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same year, he was caught {{stealing}} two <b>purses</b> from <b>the</b> Vogue Beauty Shop. Since <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purses</b> exceeded $25, Bethea was convicted of a felony, grand larceny, and sentenced to one year in the Kentucky State Penitentiary at Eddyville. He arrived there on June 1, 1935. His physical showed him to be 5 ft tall and to weigh 128 lb. He was paroled on December 1, 1935.|$|R

25|$|The WBC {{designated}} Rahman as Vitali Klitschko's next mandatory challenger; {{the fight}} was set for April 30, 2005. Klitschko injured his thigh while training for the fight, so it was rescheduled for June 18. As this date approached, Klitschko's camp said that the thigh had not fully healed; the WBC made July 23 the new fight date. Soon after this second postponement, Vitali's doctors reportedly discovered back injuries that they said demanded minor-yet-immediate corrective surgery. The WBC pushed Rahman's title shot back again, this time to November 12; Rahman's share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purse</b> following this match would reportedly be around US$4.2million.|$|E
25|$|Before 1948 world {{championship}} matches were financed by arrangements {{similar to those}} Emanuel Lasker described for his 1894 match with Wilhelm Steinitz: either the challenger or both players, {{with the assistance of}} financial backers, would contribute to a purse; about half would be distributed to the winner's backers, and the winner would receive the larger share of the remainder (the loser's backers got nothing). The players had to meet their own travel, accommodation, food and other expenses out of their shares <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purse.</b> This system evolved out of the wagering of small stakes on club games in the early 19th century.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{financial}} pressure on Louis to resume boxing, his long-awaited rematch against Billy Conn {{had to be}} postponed to the summer of 1946, when weather conditions could accommodate a large outdoor audience. On June 19, a disappointing 40,000 saw the rematch at Yankee Stadium, in which Louis was not seriously tested. Conn, whose skills had deteriorated during the long layoff, largely avoided contact until being dispatched by knockout in the eighth round. Although the attendance did not meet expectations, the fight was still the most profitable of Louis's career to date. His share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purse</b> was $600,000, of which Louis' managers got $140,000, his ex-wife $66,000 {{and the state of}} New York $30,000.|$|E
25|$|Hagler's next {{challenger}} was Sugar Ray Leonard, who {{was returning}} to the ring after a three-year retirement (having fought just once in the previous five years.) During the pre-fight negotiations, in return for granting Hagler a larger share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purse</b> Leonard obtained several conditions which would be crucial to his strategy; a 22x22ft ring, 12oz gloves and the fight was to be over 12—not 15—rounds. Leonard was 2 years younger, had half as many fights, and unbeknownst to Hagler, had engaged in several 'real' fights behind closed doors (i.e. gloves, rounds, a referee, judges and no head gear) in order to shake off his ring rust. The fight took place at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas on April 6, 1987. Hagler was the betting favorite.|$|E
