40|$|<b>Ovarian</b> <b>cysts</b> are an {{important}} cause of reduced reproductive performance in gilts and sows. The formation of follicular cysts, although not completely elucidated yet, {{is associated with a}} deficiency in LH release and the continuous growth of follicles. Luteal cysts might arise from ovulated follicles due to premature closure of the ovulation site. The formation of <b>ovarian</b> <b>cysts</b> is probably multifactorial. Genetic factors may affect the susceptibility to this fertility disorder. Risk factors for the development of <b>ovarian</b> <b>cysts</b> are stress, mycotoxins and hormonal treatment {{over a long period of}} time, or at an improper phase of the reproductive cycle. Other, still unknown risk factors may be involved. <b>Ovarian</b> <b>cysts</b> can cause anestrus, irregular estrus cycles, behavioral changes, lower conception rates and a reduced litter size. However, not all <b>ovarian</b> <b>cysts</b> are clinically apparent. The diagnosis of <b>ovarian</b> <b>cysts</b> is based on ultrasonography.

40|$|MRL/MpJ (MRL) {{is a model}} mouse for {{autoimmune}} {{diseases that}} shows dermatitis, vasculitis, arthritis, and glomerulonephritis. In addition to these immune-associated disorders, we found that aged MRL mice develop <b>ovarian</b> <b>cysts</b> originating from the rete ovarii, which is lined by ciliated or nonciliated epithelium and considered remnants of mesonephric tubules. <b>Ovarian</b> <b>cysts,</b> which are reported to have several sources, are associated with female infertility, but information regarding the genetic etiology of <b>ovarian</b> <b>cysts</b> originating from the rete ovarii is rare. In this study, to elucidate the genetic background of development of <b>ovarian</b> <b>cysts,</b> we performed quantitative trait-locus (QTL) analysis using 120 microsatellite markers, which cover the whole genome of murine chromosomes, and 213 backcross progenies between female MRL and male C 57 BL/ 6 N mice. The quantitative trait measured was the circumferences of rete ovarii or <b>ovarian</b> <b>cysts.</b> As a result, suggestive linkages were detected on Chr 3, 4, 6, and 11, but significant linkages were located on Chr 14 by interval mapping. We thereby designated the 27. 5 -cM region of Chr 14 "MRL Rete <b>Ovarian</b> <b>Cysts</b> (mroc). " The peak regions of Chr 4 and 14 in particular showed a close additive interaction (p < 0. 00001).

40|$|Summary. -Ovarian mucinous <b>cysts,</b> but not <b>ovarian</b> <b>cysts</b> {{of other}} {{histological}} types, contain common antigens with normal gastric mucosa. By immunodiffusion, anti-gens of both extracts give identical reactions. Immunofluorescence experiments localize these antigens in the epithelial coat of <b>ovarian</b> mucinous <b>cysts</b> {{and in the}} mucous cells of the surface epithelium of the fundic and pyloric gastric mucosa. THE relationship between antigens of mucinous <b>ovarian</b> <b>cysts</b> and colonic mucosa has already been investigated by Nairn, Wallace and Guu (1971). These authors demonstrated by immunofluorescence the existence of one or several antigens com-mon to both tissues. Another study, by McNeil et al. (1969), dealt with the anti-genicity common to <b>ovarian</b> mucinous <b>cysts</b> and colonic tumours. But no com-parison has been made until now between antigens of <b>ovarian</b> <b>cysts</b> and gastric mucosa.

500|$|Noether {{remained}} a leading {{member of the}} Göttingen mathematics department until 1933; her students were sometimes called the [...] "Noether boys". In 1924, Dutch mathematician B. L. van der Waerden joined her circle and soon became the leading expositor of Noether's ideas: her work was {{the foundation for the}} second volume of his influential 1931 textbook, Moderne Algebra. By the time of her plenary address at the 1932 International Congress of Mathematicians in Zürich, her algebraic acumen was recognized around the world. The following year, Germany's Nazi government dismissed Jews from university positions, and Noether moved to the United States to take up a position at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania. In 1935 she underwent surgery for an <b>ovarian</b> <b>cyst</b> and, despite signs of a recovery, died four days later at the age of 53.|$|E

Her support was critical to the government's survival, given the even division in the house. On the morning of the vote, Parrish informed a media representative that she was suffering from severe pain due to a medical ailment (there was speculation at the time that this was appendicitis or an <b>ovarian</b> <b>cyst,</b> though informed sources now indicate that it likely was kidney stones). Some media sources speculated that she could be forced to miss the vote, but Parrish denied this, claiming, [...] "Come hell or high water, there's no frigging way I'm going to let one ovary bring the government down."

40|$|We {{describe}} a technique {{for the management}} of large benign <b>ovarian</b> <b>cysts</b> by single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) through the umbilicus. The paucity of intra-abdominal working space in large <b>ovarian</b> <b>cysts</b> poses a technical challenge. Moreover, difficult convergence of operating instruments and competition for operating space outside the abdomen during the SILS makes the procedure quite demanding, especially with the conventional instruments. The concept of providing traction by taking sutures from the abdominal wall, as done in SILS laparoscopic cholecystectomy, was applied for SILS cystectomy in large <b>ovarian</b> <b>cysts.</b> Two sutures taken through the abdominal wall and then through the cyst wall provide excellent traction and "hang" the cyst from the abdominal wall, making it convenient to dissect and operate. This technique demonstrates that SILS ovarian cystectomy is feasible, safe and technically unchallenging even in large benign <b>ovarian</b> <b>cysts...</b>|$|R
6000|$|Such a {{systematic}} suppression {{of a specific}} disease or so is really the utmost {{that could be done}} with any confidence at present, so far as the State and collective action go. [Footnote: Since the above was written, a correspondent in Honolulu has called my attention to a short but most suggestive essay by Doctor Harry Campbell in the Lancet, 1898, ii., p. 678. He uses, of course, the common medical euphemism of [...] "should not marry" [...] for [...] "should not procreate," [...] and he gives the following as a list of [...] "bars to marriage": pulmonary consumption, organic heart disease, epilepsy, insanity, diabetes, chronic Bright's disease, and rheumatic fever. I wish I had sufficient medical knowledge to analyze that proposal. He mentions inherited defective eyesight and hearing also, and the [...] "neurotic" [...] quality, with which I have dealt in my text. He adds two other suggestions that appeal to me very strongly. He proposes to bar all [...] "cases of non-accidental disease in which life is saved by the surgeon's knife," [...] and he instances particularly, strangulated hernia and <b>ovarian</b> <b>cyst.</b> And he also calls attention to apoplectic breakdown and premature senility. All these are suggestions of great value for individual conduct, but none of them have that quality of certainty that justifies collective action.] Until great advances are made in anthropology--and at present there are neither men nor endowments to justify the hope that any such advances will soon be made--that is as much as can be done hopefully for many years in the selective breeding of individuals by the community as a whole. [Footnote: If at any time certainties should replace speculations in the field of inheritance, then I fancy the common-sense of humanity will be found to be in favour of the immediate application of that knowledge to life.] At present almost every citizen in the civilized State respects the rules of the laws of consanguinity, so far as they affect brothers and sisters, with an absolute respect--an enormous triumph of training over instinct, as Dr. Beattie Crozier has pointed out--and if in the future it should be found possible to divide up humanity into groups, some of which could pair with one another only to the disadvantage of the offspring, and some of which had better have no offspring, I believe there would be remarkably little difficulty in enforcing a system of taboos in accordance with such knowledge. Only {{it would have to be}} absolutely certain knowledge proved and proved again up to the hilt. If a truth is worth application it is worth hammering home, and we have no right to expect common men to obey conclusions upon which specialists are as yet not lucidly agreed. [Footnote: It has been pointed out to me by my friend, Mr. Graham Wallas, that although the State may not undertake any positive schemes for selective breeding in the present state of our knowledge, it can no more evade a certain reaction upon these things than the individual can evade a practical solution. Although we cannot say of any specific individual that he or she is, or is not, of exceptional reproductive value to the State, we may still be able, he thinks, to point out classes which are very probably, as a whole, good reproductive classes, and we may be able to promote, or at least to avoid hindering, their increase. He instances the female elementary teacher as being probably, as a type, a more intelligent and more energetic and capable girl than the average of the stratum from which she arises, and he concludes she has a higher reproductive value--a view contrary to my argument in the text that reproductive and personal value are perhaps independent. He tells me that it is the practice of many large school boards in this country to dismiss women teachers on marriage, or to refuse promotion to these when they become mothers, which is, of course, bad for the race if personal and reproductive value are identical. He would have them retain their positions regardless of the check to their efficiency maternity entails. This is a curiously indirect way towards what one might call Galtonism. Practically he proposes to endow mothers in the name of education. For my own part I do not agree with him that this class, any more than any other class, can be shown to have a high reproductive value--which is the matter under analysis in this paper-- though I will admit that an ex-teacher will probably do infinitely more for her children than if she were an illiterate or untrained woman. I can only reiterate my conviction that nothing really effective can be organized in these matters until we are much clearer than we are at present in our ideas about them, and that a public body devoted to education has no business either to impose celibacy, or subsidize families, or experiment at all in these affairs. Not only in the case of elementary teachers, but in the case of soldiers, sailors, and so on, the State may do much to promote or discourage marriage and offspring, and no doubt it is also true, as Mr. Wallas insists, that the problems of the foreign immigrant and of racial intermarriage, loom upon us. But since we have no applicable science whatever here, since there is no certainty in any direction that any collective course may not be collectively evil rather than good, there is nothing for it, I hold, but to leave these things to individual experiment, and to concentrate our efforts where there is a clearer hope of effective consequence. Leave things to individual initiative and some of us will, by luck or inspiration, go right; take public action on an insufficient basis of knowledge and there is a clear prospect of collective error. The imminence of these questions argues for nothing except prompt and vigorous research.] ...|$|E
