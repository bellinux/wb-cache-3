5|$|Xerocomellus zelleri {{was first}} {{described}} by American mycologist William Alphonso Murrill in 1912, based on specimens he found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>campus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> University of Washington.

In 1959, mycologists Rolf Singer, Snell and Esther A. Dick transferred the species to Boletellus, explaining that the microstructure of the trama and the faint ornamentation of the spores were inconsistent with placement in Xerocomus. American mycologist Harry D. Thiers, in his 1976 monograph on North American boletes, claimed that he failed to consistently find ornamentation on the spores of material he collected, and preferred to retain the species in Boletus. In 2011, it {{was moved to the}} genus Xerocomellus.|$|E
