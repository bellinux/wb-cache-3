5|$|In May 2013, Alamogordo's City Commission {{approved}} {{a deal for}} Canada-based film production company Fuel Industries to excavate the Atari landfill site. Fuel Entertainment partnered with Xbox Entertainment Studios and Lightbox to make a documentary about the 1983 massive game burial of Atari games, said {{to be one of}} the gaming culture's greatest urban legends. On April 26, 2014, video game archaeologists began sifting through years <b>of</b> <b>trash</b> from the old Alamogordo landfill. The first batch of E.T. games was discovered after about three hours of digging, and hundreds more were found in the mounds <b>of</b> <b>trash</b> and dirt scooped by a backhoe. In the deal between the City of Alamogordo and Fuel Entertainment regarding the excavation, Fuel Entertainment was to be given 250 games or 10 percent of what was found.|$|E

5|$|Litter {{accumulation}} is {{a perennial}} {{problem in the}} subway system. In the 1970s and 1980s, dirty trains and platforms, as well as graffiti were a serious problem. The situation had improved since then, but the 2010 budget crisis, which caused over 100 of the cleaning staff to lose their jobs, threatened to curtail trash removal from the subway system. Every day, the MTA removes 40 tons <b>of</b> <b>trash</b> from 3,500 trash receptacles.|$|E
40|$|Trashing has the {{potential}} to improve yield by conserving water, soil C and soil N in sugarcane production. However, the benefits <b>of</b> <b>trashing</b> are complex to determine because of variability in rainfall (between regions and seasons) and the long-term effect of cropping soil systems on N dynamics. In a companion paper a cropping systems model, which accounts for the impacts of water and N stress on sugarcane growth, was shown to predict the long-term response of cane yield and soil organic matter changes under a range <b>of</b> <b>trashing</b> treatments. This paper expands the modelling analysis by examining the benefits <b>of</b> <b>trashing</b> over a wider range of soils and climatic conditions. Possible changes to cane production management practices in the South African sugar industry following the adoption <b>of</b> <b>trashing</b> are discussed...|$|R

5|$|In modern times, a {{wide variety}} of causes have contributed to the condor's decline. Its low clutch size (one young per nest), {{combined}} with a late age of sexual maturity, make the bird vulnerable to artificial population decline. Significant past damage to the condor population has also been attributed to poaching, especially for museum specimens, lead poisoning (from eating animals containing lead shot), DDT poisoning, electric power lines, egg collecting, and habitat destruction. During the California Gold Rush, some condors were even kept as pets. The leading cause of mortality in nestling condors is the ingestion <b>of</b> <b>trash</b> that is fed to them by their parents.|$|E
5|$|Restoring {{the stream}} {{has made the}} area, a two-hour drive from Phoenix, highly popular. As {{recreational}} use of Fossil Creek increased after 2008, accumulations <b>of</b> <b>trash</b> and human waste as well as damage to forests and stream banks became problematic. The Forest Service at times closes parts of Forest Road 708 (Fossil Creek Road) to limit danger from traffic jams. Campfires are prohibited between the Fossil Creek headwaters and the dry bed of Stehr Lake, and other restrictions apply. Since 2009, the Forest Service {{has been working on}} a comprehensive management plan for Fossil Creek.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, a TV {{film was}} made on her life — The Jayne Mansfield Story — which was {{nominated}} for three Emmy Awards in the categories for hair, makeup and costume. In the film directed by Dick Lowry, Mansfield is played by Loni Anderson and her husband Mickey Hargitay is played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. She was featured in the A Television Networks TV series Biography in an episode titled Jayne Mansfield: Blonde Ambition. The TV series won an Emmy Award in outstanding non-fiction TV series category in 2001. A again featured her life in another TV serial titled Dangerous Curves in 1999. In 1988, her story and archival footage {{was a part of}} TV documentary Hollywood Sex Symbols. The first film documentary on her, The Wild, Wild World of Jayne Mansfield, started with herself working in the film, but it was finished in 1968 after her death and had to make use of archival footage.

5|$|Off {{the coast}} of Fort Lauderdale is the Osborne Reef, an {{artificial}} reef made of discarded tires that {{has proven to be}} an ecological disaster. The dumping began in the 1960s, with the intent to provide habitat for fish while disposing <b>of</b> <b>trash</b> from the land. However, in the rugged and corrosive environment of the ocean, nylon straps used to secure the tires wore out, cables rusted, and tires broke free. The tires posed a particular threat after breaking free from their restraints. The tires then migrated shoreward and ran into a living reef tract, washed up on its slope and killed many things in their path. In recent years, thousands of tires have also washed up on nearby beaches, especially during hurricanes. Local authorities are now working to remove the 700,000 tires, in cooperation with the U.S. Army, Navy and Coast Guard.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} vacuum trains that are {{designed}} to remove trash off of the tracks, but are ineffective and often broken. A 2016 study by Travel Math had the New York City Subway listed as the dirtiest subway system in the country {{based on the number of}} viable bacteria cells. In August 2016, the MTA announced that it had initiated Operation Track Sweep, which is an aggressive plan that will dramatically reduce the amount <b>of</b> <b>trash</b> on the tracks and in the subway environment, and in turn should reduce track fires and train delays. The frequency of station track cleaning will be increased. In a two-week period, 94 stations will be cleaned, an increase from 34 stations. Starting on September 12, 2016, the MTA launched an intensive two-week, system-wide cleaning from all of the tracks at all of the system's stations. New portable track vacuum systems are in the works as the MTA is working with two manufacturers. Three new powerful vacuum trains, two arriving in 2017, and the third in 2018, and 27 new refuse cars will be part of the operation.|$|E

40|$|Recycling can {{be defined}} as the “act of {{processing}} used or abandoned materials for use in creating new products”. A recycling bin is a container which used to keep garbage or disposed item before being act by the respective authority to bring it the recycling centre. Recycling bins can be found in various forms and sizes. Nowadays, {{there are a lot of}} models <b>of</b> recycle <b>trash</b> bin which do not have the correct specification and yet have the disadvantage. The trash was not compacted, so it will requires a lot of space at the landfill. As a result, some of the landfill cannot afford to take all the <b>trash.</b> Part <b>of</b> the objective of this project is to overcome the problems occur nowadays by fabricating and designing the new concept <b>of</b> the recycle <b>trash</b> bin. The main scopes of this research are for two type <b>of</b> <b>trasher,</b> which are the 325 ml cans and 600 ml bottles. The design of the new concept <b>of</b> recycle <b>trash</b> bin for this project is basically from the research of existing models found in the current market. It comes with the lots of advantages from two major models, which are “separated trash model” and “un separated trash model”. The main materials that being use to fabricate the recycle trash bin is metal. The cover <b>of</b> recycle <b>trash</b> bin is made from acrylic. In creating and fabricate the recycle trash bin it will use a lot of machines. After the fabrication process, this recycle trash bin will be able to compact the trash successfully. Compare to the other model that exists in today’s market, this new recycle trash bin in more suitable for the use of the household. It is because the size <b>of</b> this recycle <b>trash</b> bin is smaller and the specialty is that in one recycle trash bin, consumer will found two different containers. So it will able to reduce the space used. The shaft will connect to the compactor and the handle shaft <b>of</b> the recycle <b>trash</b> bin can support the load when being use to compress the trash. There are no failures found during compacting the trash. As the conclusion from this project, this new design <b>of</b> recycle <b>trash</b> bin will be able to help and overcome the problems occurs nowadays and give advantages to users...|$|R
