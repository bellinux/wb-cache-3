5|$|With Craig Kundrot, Richards {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} high pressure (1000 atmospheres) on protein structure, using hen-egg lysozyme crystals, finding that the structure was robust to such pressures apart from a quite modest compaction in size.

5|$|Additionally, the {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>Theory</b> of Mind {{may play a}} role in emotional development. Theory of Mind is the ability to know that the experience of knowledge and intention lies behind human actions such as facial expressions. Although it is reported that very young infants have different responses to humans than to non-human objects, Theory of Mind develops relatively gradually and possibly results from predictable interactions with adults. However, some ability of this kind must be in place before mutual communication through gaze or other gesture can occur, as it does by seven to nine months. Some neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, have been attributed to the absence of the mental functions that underlie Theory of Mind. It is possible that the congenital absence of this ability, or the lack of experiences with caregivers who communicate in a predictable fashion, could underlie {{the development}} of reactive attachment disorder.|$|E

5|$|Byard {{began playing}} professionally on piano {{at the age}} of 16, in bands led by Doc Kentross and Freddy Bates. His early lessons had {{involved}} mostly playing by rote, so his development of knowledge <b>of</b> <b>theory</b> and further piano technique occurred from the late 1930s until 1941, including studying harmony at Commerce High School. In that year he was drafted into the army, where he continued with piano lessons and was influenced by pianist Ernie Washington, with whom he was barracked, although Byard also took up trombone at this time. He also studied Stravinsky and Chopin, and continued studying classical composers into the 1960s. Part of his military service was in Florida, where he was a mentor to the young saxophonist Cannonball Adderley and his brother, Nat. After leaving the army in 1946, Byard's musical education continued, through discussions with others, and using library materials combined with music school syllabuses.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present an}} {{approach}} for designing decision procedures {{based on the}} reduction <b>of</b> complex <b>theories</b> to simpler ones.

Reduction functions allow us to reduce the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> lists to the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> constructors, the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> arrays to the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> equality, the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> sets to the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> equality, and the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> multisets to the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> integers. Finally, we provide a method for combining reduction functions. This method allows us to reduce the satisfiability problem of a combination <b>of</b> complex <b>theories</b> to the combination of simpler ones. ...|$|R
