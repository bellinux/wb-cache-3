40|$|The {{rising costs}} of oil {{products}} on the global market and increasing dependency on fossil fuels have become a concern for both governments and international bodies. Aside from calls to governments to move towards alternatives {{in the form of}} renewable energy, the impact of government financial support to businesses in the oil sector in the form of subsides has also come under criticism. Advocates for <b>oil</b> subsidy <b>removal</b> argue that these subsidies only divert much needed investment in development projects especially in the developing economies, to rich players in the oil sector. In January 2012, the Nigerian government therefore announced its policy to remove the subsidies attached to oil products. The announcement was received with wide public protests which the government sought to calm with a 'Subsidy Reinvestment and Empowerment (SURE-P) programme'. This article considers the broad context of <b>oil</b> subsidy <b>removal</b> in Nigeria.

40|$|Pretreatment {{of waste}} {{emulsions}} with high organic content {{by a combined}} process of vibratory shear enhanced process and Fenton's oxidation prior to biological treatment was investigated. Vibrating membrane had shown good performance in chemical oxygen demand and <b>oil</b> <b>removals</b> and the mitigation of concentration polarization. However, the permeate after filtration processing still contained high content of organics. Thus, additional Fenton oxidation was applied to reduce the organic loading, and improve the biodegradability of the wastewater. The optimal molar ratio of ferrous iron to hydrogen peroxide was 0. 05 obtained from the jar-test experiments. Removal of organics was enhanced by increasing hydrogen peroxide dosage, while efficiency of hydrogen peroxide reached maximum of 1. 11 (w/w) at the hydrogen peroxide dosage of 6. 8 g/L. Furthermore, the biological experiments indicated that the high concentration of organics could inhibit microbial activity, which decreased the chemical oxygen demand degradation rates. The adaptive period of the microbe was greatly shortened using Fenton's reagent at the low dosages.

40|$|The {{cleanability}} {{of several}} model solid substrates (glass, stainless steel, polystyrene and polytetrafluoroethylene-PTFE) was studied with a radial-flow cell.

Glass was the most cleanable substrate, a result which may {{be consistent with the}} presence of a swelling gel-like layer at the surface. For the other substrates, the mechanical action exerted by the fluid {{played a major role in}} oil removal; however the detergent seemed to intervene after about 5 - 10 min, facilitating cleaning of PTFE. <b>Oil</b> droplet <b>removal</b> took place only at high wall shear stress, in zones where flow conditions where not well controlled making it impossible to evaluate the wall shear stresses needed for <b>oil</b> droplet <b>removal.</b> Evaluation of cleanability by using the radial-flow cell is restricted to variations of wall shear stresses in a range below 3 N m(- 2).

40|$|The {{potential}} for soil contamination by oil spills is growing, due to heavy industrialization {{and economic development}} of countries. Due to this fact, the bioremediation has become an alternative to remediate areas {{through the use of}} biological agents. Two microorganisms, isolated from a lipid-rich effluent, were used in the bioaugmentation of soils contaminated with diesel oil, lubricating oil and soybean oil. Natural attenuation tests were conducted as controls. The removal of diesel fuel at the time of 21 d were of 18. 5 %, 7. 30 % and 11. 38 %, respectively, for the bioaugmentation with isolated I 1 and I 2 and natural attenuation. The <b>removal</b> of lubricating <b>oil</b> were 41. 6 %, 14. 16 % and 6. 91 % respectively for the bioaugmentation with the isolated I 1 and I 2 and natural attenuation, while for soybean <b>oil</b> <b>removals</b> were of 87 8 %, 73. 9 % and 49. 4 %.

50|$|Water-alternating-gas (WAG) {{injection}} {{is another}} technique employed in EOR.  Water {{is used in}} addition to carbon dioxide.  A saline solution is used here so that carbonate formations in oil wells are not disturbed. Water and carbon dioxide are injected into the oil well for larger recovery, as they typically have low miscibility with oil. Use of both water and carbon dioxide also lowers the mobility of carbon dioxide, making the gas more effective at displacing the oil in the well. According to a study done by Kovscek, using small slugs of both carbon dioxide and water allows for quick recovery of the oil. Additionally, in a study done by Dang in 2014, using water with a lower salinity allows for greater <b>oil</b> <b>removal,</b> and greater geochemical interactions.|$|E

40|$|Palm oil {{industry}} {{is one of}} the three major agro-industries in Southern Thailand and generates large quantities of effluent with high organic matter (BOD and COD values of 58, 000 and 110, 000 mg/l, respectively), total solids and suspended solids (70, 000 and 40, 000 mg/l, respectively), oil & grease (25, 600 mg/l), and has a low pH (4. 5). Conventional anaerobic ponding system is normally employed in palm oil mills to treat the effluent. To increase its efficiency, biopretreatment to remove the organic matter and oil & grease by thermotolerant polymer-producing fungi was investigated. The palm oil mill effluent (POME) was treated by the two thermotolerant polymer-producing fungi, Rhizopus sp. ST 4 and Rhizopus sp. ST 29, at 45 ºC under aseptic and septic conditions. Rhizopus sp. ST 4 gave the same <b>oil</b> & grease <b>removal</b> (84. 2 %) under both conditions but COD removal under septic condition (62. 2 %) was 8. 8 % higher than that under aseptic condition (53. 4 %).

In some instances, claims for removal cost reimbursement can be initially brought to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund thus sidestepping the responsible party. For example, claimants advised by the EPA, governors of affected states, and American claimants for incidents involving foreign vessels or facilities may initially present their claims to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. When claims for removal cost reimbursement are brought to the fund, the claimant must prove that removal costs were sustained from activities required to avoid or alleviate effects of the incident and that such actions were approved or directed by the federal on-scene coordinator.|$|E
50|$|Enzymatic {{hydrolysis}} {{similar to}} the body's natural digestive process provides the most efficient breakdown of the proteins into smaller fractions termed peptides which can then {{be separated from the}} oil and non-digested proteins during liquid phase processing. Subsequent steps of solids and <b>oil</b> <b>removal</b> through various mechanical separation techniques are required to create a final fish protein fraction with acceptable organoleptic properties for use in human food. Minimization of odor through the elimination of fat and oil from the protein fraction, as well as separating out the lowest molecular weight protein fractions from the larger fractions all serve to create a refined fish protein. Some processes utilize solvents to extract the fat but these can result in dangerous handling and potential residual issues. The final step in producing the product is typically spray drying, which involves atomizing the liquid protein in a hot air chamber resulting in rapid evaporation of the water and a fine powder falling {{to the bottom of the}} chamber for removal. Spray drying is different from typical oven dehydration used in animal grade fish meal production in that spray drying will not denature the protein fraction resulting in a higher quality protein product for human consumption.|$|E

Preand postoperative ERG a- and b-wave amplitudes were compared. Results: Twenty-eight eyes of 28 patients including 20 male and 8 female subjects with mean age of 39. 3 ± 0. 06 (range, 12 to 85) years were studied. Mean interval from primary vitreoretinal surgery to silicone <b>oil</b> <b>removal</b> was 21. 04 ± 0. 52 (range, 7 to 39) months. Mean duration from silicone <b>oil</b> <b>removal</b> to second ERG was 13. 04 ± 1. 75 (range, 10 to 16) days. Before silicone <b>oil</b> <b>removal,</b> mean a-wave amplitudes in maximal combined response, rod response and cone response ERGs were 27. 4 ± 19. 9, 7. 2 ± 4. 5 and 5. 5 ± 3. 4 µv, respectively.
