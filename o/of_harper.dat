Reaching estimated maximum winds of , the tornado continued on its northeast track, crossing County Roads 18 and 21, Alabama State Highway 69, and County Road 29 as it moved south and east of the small communities <b>of</b> <b>Harper</b> Hill and Ingram. The tornado caused extensive structural damage through this area, consisting of many mobile homes and site-built homes being either heavily damaged or destroyed. A church in the area was heavily damaged, vehicles were tossed and destroyed, and thousands of trees were downed as well.|$|E
5|$|In the playoffs, the Pittsburgh Steelers {{visited the}} RCA Dome {{for the second}} AFC divisional playoff game of the 2005 season. In the fourth quarter {{with only a few}} minutes left in the game, Manning threw what looked to be the game-ending {{interception}} to safety Troy Polamalu, but the interception was overturned (a call the NFL later admitted was incorrect). The Colts went on to score, and got the ball back down three points {{near the end of the}} game. On fourth down, Manning was sacked near his own goal line, and the game seemed to be over as the Steelers were one yard from a touchdown. On the next play, the ball was fumbled by running back Jerome Bettis and picked up by Colts defender Nick Harper who appeared to have a clear path down the sideline for what might have been the game-winning score. However, Steelers' quarterback Ben Roethlisberger dove in front <b>of</b> <b>Harper</b> and tackled him by the leg, saving a touchdown. Then the Colts drove down the field to the Steelers 27-yard line, before Mike Vanderjagt missed a field goal as time ran out.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, the {{publication}} rights were first owned by Macmillan Publishers, {{and later by}} HarperCollins. The two issued both hardcover and paperback editions of the series during their tenure as publishers, {{while at the same}} time Scholastic, Inc. produced paperback versions for sale primarily through direct mail order, book clubs, and book fairs. Harper Collins also published several one-volume collected editions containing the full text of the series. As noted below (see reading order), the first American publisher, Macmillan, numbered the books in publication sequence, but when Harper Collins won the rights in 1994, at the suggestion of Lewis's stepson they used the series' internal chronological order. Scholastic switched the numbering of its paperback editions in 1994 to mirror that <b>of</b> <b>Harper</b> Collins.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} project documents the evolution <b>of</b> <b>harp</b> pedagogy in twentieth century America. The investigation focused on teaching trends, materials used, and influences {{that had an}} impact on the harp community during this period of time. Information for the study was gathered through questionnaires and personal interviews. Seventy-one harp teachers from throughout the United States, divided into three groups based upon experience, completed a survey on harp pedagogy. Respondents answered questions regarding school <b>of</b> <b>harp</b> playing, instructional methods, and the sequencing of technical skills for the beginning student. In addition, teachers provided their opinions about the quantity and quality <b>of</b> <b>harp</b> teaching materials during the twentieth century, and listed important individuals, organizations, and events. Data gathered from surveys was compared for similarities and differences between the three groups. Results indicated that opportunities for harp study increased significantly from 1900 - 2000, and that 77 % of all teaching materials currently in use were written in 1930 or later. The diversity of teaching methods and materials increased as well, with moderately experienced and less experienced teachers being more likely to combine schools <b>of</b> <b>harp</b> playing in their instruction and use a variety of books with beginning students. The more experienced group of teachers tended to have specific opinions about what materials they use in lessons and were more likely to follow a single school <b>of</b> <b>harp</b> playing. A majority of teachers agreed that the quantity <b>of</b> <b>harp</b> teaching materials increased during the twentieth century, but felt that the quality of these materials either stayed the same or declined.

25|$|From 1975 to 1980 Harper {{worked with}} English {{musician}} and 'Black Sheep' member Andy Roberts sometimes performing as a duo. During this period, Harper spent considerable {{time in the}} United States and signed with the US division of Chrysalis Records, who released HQ under a different title – When an Old Cricketer Leaves the Crease – and with alternative artwork. Chrysalis considered the original Hipgnosis-designed album cover <b>of</b> <b>Harper</b> walking on water to be too offensive for an American release. Harper disagreed, but was given no choice by the label. Chrysalis also changed the title of Harper's next album, Bullinamingvase, to One of Those Days in England. In 1978, US Chrysalis reissued Harper's first five Harvest albums, only one of which (Flat, Baroque and Berserk) had been previously released in America.|$|E
25|$|With {{a lineup}} <b>of</b> <b>Harper,</b> Jordan, Pippen, Rodman and Longley, {{and perhaps the}} league's best bench in Steve Kerr, Kukoc, Wennington, Buechler, and guard Randy Brown, the Bulls posted {{one of the best}} single-season {{improvements}} in league history and the best single-season record at that time, moving from 47–35 to 72–10, becoming the first NBA team to win 70 or more games. Jordan won his eighth scoring title, and Rodman his fifth straight rebounding title, while Kerr finished second in the league in three-point shooting percentage. Jordan garnered the elusive triple crown with the NBA MVP, NBA All-Star Game MVP, and NBA Finals MVP. Krause was named NBA Executive of the Year, Jackson Coach of the Year, and Kukoc the Sixth Man of the Year. Both Pippen and Jordan made the All-NBA First Team, and Jordan, Pippen, and Rodman made the All-Defensive First Team, making the Bulls the only team in NBA history with three players on the All-Defensive First Team.|$|E
