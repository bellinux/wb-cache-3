50|$|The {{forest in}} Frozen Head's lower {{elevations}} {{consists of a}} mixed mesophytic forest, and includes species of hemlock, maple, tulip poplar, <b>oak,</b> <b>and</b> hickory. As elevation increases along mountain slopes, the mesophytic forest gives way to an oak forest consisting largely of white <b>oak</b> <b>and</b> tulip poplar. Chestnut <b>oak</b> <b>and</b> shortleaf pine are the dominant species along the higher ridge crests and mountain tops.|$|R
5|$|Fishers, {{medium-sized}} weasels, were reintroduced to Pine Creek Gorge {{as part of}} {{an effort}} to establish a healthy population of fishers in Pennsylvania. Prior to the lumber era, fishers were numerous throughout the forests of Pennsylvania. They are generalized predators and will hunt any smaller creatures in their territory, including porcupines. Elk have been reintroduced west of the gorge in Clinton County and occasionally wander near the west rim of the canyon. Coyotes have come back on their own. Invasive insect species in the gorge include gypsy moth larvae, which eat all the leaves off trees, especially <b>oaks,</b> <b>and</b> hemlock woolly adelgids, which weaken and kill hemlocks. Invasive plant species include purple loosestrife and Japanese knotweed.|$|E
5|$|Fruit bodies grow on the ground. Phellodon species, {{like all}} members of the order Thelephorales, are thought to be mycorrhizal, forming {{symbiotic}} relationships with trees. Usual hosts include species from the families Fagaceae (beeches and <b>oaks)</b> <b>and</b> Pinaceae. The ectomycorrhizae that P.niger forms with Norway spruce (Picea abies) has been comprehensively described. It is distinguished from the ectomycorrhizae of other Thelephorales species by the unique shape of its chlamydospores. Stable isotope ratio analysis of the abundance of the stable isotope carbon-13 shows that P.niger has a metabolic signature close to that of saprotrophic fungi, indicating that it may be able to obtain carbon from sources other than a tree host.|$|E
5|$|Greater Moncton {{has many}} golfing facilities. There are nine 18-hole golf {{courses in the}} census {{metropolitan}} area, four of which are residential courses with courseside housing developments either existing or under construction. Both the Royal <b>Oaks</b> <b>and</b> Fox Creek golf clubs can be considered championship courses, with Royal Oaks being the first Rees Jones designed golf course in Canada. Other notable courses include the Moncton Golf & Country Club, Hillsborough Golf Club, Memramcook Valley Golf Club and the Mountain Woods Golf Club.|$|E
50|$|Woodland {{areas are}} {{composed}} of species like coast live <b>oak</b> <b>and</b> California bay trees, as well as poison <b>oak</b> <b>and</b> California blackberry. Scrub areas support many aromatic varieties of sagebrush, coyote bush, and monkeyflower.|$|R

5|$|Her sire, St. Simon was an unbeaten racehorse who was {{beginning}} to prove himself as an outstanding sire. By the time La Fleche was sold in 1890 {{he was on the}} way to the first of his nine sires’ championships, having sired the first two of his ten Classic winners. Her dam, Quiver produced La Fleche’s full-sister Memoir, who won the Epsom <b>Oaks</b> <b>and</b> the St Leger as well as the influential broodmares Maid Marian and Satchel.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to meat or fur hunts, {{there are also}} competition hunts to demonstrate the speed and skill of the dog. In these the raccoons are not killed, but are treed and released. Some of the largest competition hunts are the Grand American, Autumn <b>Oaks,</b> <b>and</b> Leafy Oaks. Coon hunting has been recorded in such books as Where the Red Fern Grows and popularized in stories and songs recorded by Jerry Clower, Jimmy Martin and others. In Alabama, there is a cemetery specifically for the burial of coonhounds.|$|E
5|$|In {{this period}} Ruisdael started {{painting}} coastal scenes and sea-pieces, influenced by Simon de Vlieger and Jan Porcellis. Among {{the most dramatic}} is Rough Sea at a Jetty, with a restricted palette of only black, white, blue and a few brown earth colours. However, forest scenes remain a subject of choice, such as the Hermitage's most famous Ruisdael, A Wooded Marsh, dated 1665, which depicts a primeval scene with broken birches and <b>oaks,</b> <b>and</b> branches reaching for the sky amidst an overgrown pond.|$|E
5000|$|The {{forest cover}} {{includes}} chestnut <b>oak</b> <b>and</b> {{various types of}} yellow pine. Northern red <b>oak</b> <b>and</b> hickories are found near Highcock Knob. The wilderness has sheltered coves with white <b>oak,</b> basswood <b>and</b> tulip poplar. Old growth trees {{are found in the}} watershed of Matt’s Creek and along the James River where the Appalachian Trail goes into the drainage of Matt’s Creek.|$|R

50|$|Principal plant {{communities}} {{within the}} upper reaches include the dominant California <b>oak</b> woodland, <b>and</b> also consist of douglas-fir woodland and riparian woodland. Within the oak woodland the main tree species are Coast live oak, Oregon oak, California black oak, Canyon live <b>oak</b> <b>and</b> California bay laurel. The woodland understory exhibits toyon, coffeeberry, poison <b>oak</b> <b>and</b> numerous other flowering plants such as snowberry and the uncommon American Ginseng.|$|R
5|$|Plants {{and animals}} include those {{generally}} common to Central Europe. Beeches, <b>oaks,</b> <b>and</b> other deciduous trees constitute {{one-third of the}} forests; conifers are increasing {{as a result of}} reforestation. Spruce and fir trees predominate in the upper mountains, while pine and larch are found in sandy soil. There are many species of ferns, flowers, fungi, and mosses. Wild animals include roe deer, wild boar, mouflon (a subspecies of wild sheep), fox, badger, hare, and small numbers of the Eurasian beaver. The blue cornflower was once a German national symbol.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of European American {{settlers}} and explorers, the Allegheny Plateau region of West Virginia, lying {{to the west of the}} Allegheny and Cumberland mountain ranges of the Appalachian Mountains, was overlaid with old-growth forests consisting predominantly of deciduous mixed <b>oaks</b> <b>and</b> chestnut trees. The cove forests of the Appalachian Mountains were undisturbed for approximately 300 million years, and the ample moisture and deep soils of cove topography allowed for the proliferation of temperate broadleaf and mixed forest species.|$|E
5|$|Red maple is {{far more}} {{abundant}} today than when Europeans first arrived in North America, where along with its cousin Silver Maple, it may have comprised a mere 5% of forest area and was confined mostly to riparian zones. The density of the tree {{in many of these}} areas has increased 6 to 7 fold and this trend seems to be continuing, much of it due to human factors, especially suppression of wildfires which would kill shallow-rooted pioneer species like red maple, but leave mainline forest trees like <b>oaks</b> <b>and</b> hickories untouched.|$|E

5|$|Sheep {{follow a}} diurnal pattern of activity, feeding {{from dawn to}} dusk, {{stopping}} sporadically to rest and chew their cud. Ideal pasture for sheep is not lawnlike grass, but an array of grasses, legumes and forbs. Types of land where sheep are raised vary widely, from pastures that are seeded and improved intentionally to rough, native lands. Common plants toxic to sheep are present {{in most of the}} world, and include (but are not limited to) cherry, some <b>oaks</b> <b>and</b> acorns, tomato, yew, rhubarb, potato, and rhododendron.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{opened in}} 1921 and spurred {{a new wave}} of {{development}} in South Jacksonville. New subdivisions were platted in Oklahoma and Villa Alexandria, including South Shores, Alexandria Place, River <b>Oaks,</b> <b>and</b> the original San Marco development, while the old Red Bank plantation became South Riverside and Colonial Manor. The 1857 the Red Bank Plantation House became a residence in the Colonial Manor neighborhood that grew around it; it is Jacksonville's second oldest residential building still in use. The bridge triggered economic development in South Jacksonville as well, though it greatly reduced the ferry business, which disappeared entirely within twenty years.|$|E
5|$|The forest areas {{suffer from}} strong {{demographic}} pressure and intensive agriculture. Some forests locally known as bouças are defined areas with maritime pines, <b>oaks</b> <b>and</b> eucalyptus plantations. Forests are still important in parishes {{surrounded by the}} Serra de Rates, whose flora is distinguished by the pedunculate oak or the european holly. In the 18th century, the monks of Tibães planted pines, which characterized the civil parish of Estela. In the past the Atlantic forest predominated, with trees such as oaks, ash trees, hazels, strawberry trees, holm oak, and alders.|$|E
