Odour measurement is not widely practised in Ireland, yet local authorities are frequently in receipt of odour derived public complaints. This dissertation examines the fundamentals of <b>odour</b> <b>nuisance</b> in terms of how we perceive odours, common sources of environmental odours, the principles of odour measurement (in particular the Sutch pre-standard on olfactometry) and the extent to which <b>odour</b> <b>nuisance</b> is a problem in Ireland. The intention is to provide a reference document for use by those interested parties in the country who may be variously involved in policy making, legislative development, enforcement of environmental law or any person who has an interest in odours and the public nuisance they can give rise to. In particular the aim was to provide previously undocumented information on the prevalence of <b>odour</b> <b>nuisance</b> in Ireland, the exercision of the available powers to control odours, and the possible value of odour measurement as part of a regulatory process. A questionnaire was circulated to all local authorities in the country and 82...|$|E
40|$|A study {{based on}} the literature, an on- farm audit and expert knowledge, was carried out to {{determine}} 1) the risks of spread of animal diseases among farms; 2) <b>odour</b> <b>nuisance</b> due to carcasses at the rendering plant; and 3) measurements to reduce these risks. It was concluded that the possible risks of spread of animal diseases among farms due to the removal of carcasses mainly {{has to do with}} the entrance of the place from where the carcasses are collected by the driver of the truck, the contact of the grab of the haulier with the cadaver container or place and driving with the haulier which is not fully closed. The true size of the risk of spread of disease is unknown and is probably different for each pathogen. Strict hygiene measurements by the driver and farmer can reduce the risk of spread of animal diseases due to cadaver removal. According to the interviewees at the expert assessment session, the <b>odour</b> <b>nuisance</b> at the rendering plant due to carcasses is mainly caused by bacterial conversion of proteins. Cooling of carcasses contribute to the slowing down of the conversions. No unambigious answer could be obtained as to the cooling temperature: not lower than - 7 °C because of the processing at the rendering plant and preferably not higher than 5 °C. Frequent removal of carcasses from the farms and a quick handling at the rendering plant may also reduce <b>odour</b> <b>nuisance</b> at the rendering plant.

40|$|Oxidation of malodorous {{compounds}} such as {{volatile organic}} compounds (VOC), hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S) and volatile organic sulphur compounds (VOSC) generally leads to a significant decrease or even a complete elimination of their <b>odour</b> <b>nuisance.</b> Unfortunately, the oxidation rates of these compounds are often slow under standard conditions of temperature and atmospheric pressure. Even the oxidation rates of easily oxidisable compounds can still be too limited for complete oxidation and elimination of their <b>odour</b> <b>nuisance.</b> The latter is often related to the very low odour threshold values of these compounds, which can easily be in the ppb range. For instance, although H 2 S is oxidised quite easily under standard conditions (Kamei and Ohmoto 2000), {{it is one of}} the most frequent causes of <b>odour</b> <b>nuisance</b> from waste treatment processes. This chapter overviews the principles of catalytic oxidation processes and gives examples of their application in the area of odour abatement. It should be noted that many of these catalytic oxidation processes are studied mainly for their capacity to remove several well-defined compounds. Thus, these studies mainly report on the removal efficiency of these compounds and mostly do not present data on the odour removal efficiency...|$|E

40|$|In Europe {{and around}} the world, field studies {{conducted}} in areas surrounding the odour source are used for evaluating the <b>odour</b> <b>nuisance</b> and for emission studies.

The monitoring network consisted of two measurement stations localized in a vicinity of crude oil processing plant and four stations localized near the main emitters of volatile odorous compounds such as sewage treatment plant, municipal landfill, phosphatic fertilizer production plant. The electronic nose prototype was equipped with a set of six semiconductor sensors by FIGARO Co. and one PID-type sensor. The field olfactometers were utilized for determination of mean concentration of odorants and for calibration of the electronic nose prototypes in order to provide their proper operation.

40|$|Many jurisdictions compare model {{predicted}} {{odour concentration}} statistics against regulatory exposure limits or criteria {{in order to}} assess the risk of proposed developments resulting in <b>nuisance</b> <b>odour</b> impacts. However dose response studies designed to calibrate such criteria have returned widely divergent findings, particularly regarding the degree of influence that the frequency and intensity of odour impact events have on adverse community response (annoyance). In the absence of clear guidance from empirical data, jurisdictions have adopted a wide range of odour impact criteria and harmonisation has proven difficult to progress. This lack of harmonisation constitutes a significant gap in best-practice standards for odour impact assessment methodology and creates a substantial risk of poor assessment outcomes. In this paper a conceptual framework is developed which facilitates close investigation of the relationship between annoyance levels, the frequency and intensity dimensions of <b>nuisance</b> <b>odour</b> and exposure criteria. Within this framework the efficacy of single-percentile odour criteria to limit <b>nuisance</b> <b>odour</b> impacts is examined for several models of annoyance. Significant short-comings in single-percentile criteria are identified in those models in which both the frequency and intensity of impact events are assumed to influence annoyance on time-scales such as a year. The merits and limitations of an alternative multi-percentile criterion framework approach are examined. Models of annoyance developed within the framework suggest an improved concept of odour criteria that may lead to better assessment outcomes, assist with the reconciliation of some seemingly disparate dose response study findings and aid harmonisation of jurisdictional exposure limits...|$|R
40|$|In indoor {{environment}} situations severe <b>odour</b> <b>nuisances</b> often limits or prevents use. This often {{is reason to}} check indoor Air PAH-contamination which mainly derive {{from a variety of}} building material containing coal tar constituents. Today the use of tar as an additive to wood-preservatives, solvents and building material is strongly restricted in Germany (GefStoffV) but other sources for similar odours are fire-events, asphalt and bitumen products. Using a modified VDI method 3875 - 1 including an additional sampling on Polyurethane-foam for analysing air-samples, very variable patterns of single PAH concentrations are obtained which correspond to the source-type. While high concentrations with naphthalene are regularly found indoors, not volatile and rather dust-borne PAH like Benzoapyrene (BaP) rarely occur in concentrations about 2 ng/m. Some PAH have a very high carcinogenic potency in human, some smell intensively. However, as the absence of the characteristic smell does not implicate the absence of PAH, it cannot be used for remediation guidelines and health-concerns remain. For remediation official threshold guideline levels and remediation action criteria are needed. In this course a risk-assessment is proposed using PAH toxicity equivalence factors (TEF) against BaP. Multiplication with measured concentrations and summarising leads to the Cancerogenic Equivalence Sum (KEsum) for the 16 measured PAH. Using data on the additional cancer risk through definite BaP-exposition in the PAH mixture of coking plant gas (unit risk) we can postulate a KEsum of 1, 36 for this gas. On a basis of this scaling we can quantify the additional cancer risk for various air samples. Accepted risks of 10 - 4 and 5 · 10 - 4 lead to guideline values for successful remediation of KEsum = 10. 0.

40|$|New {{technologies}} {{are needed for}} manure treatment that can capture nutrients, reduce emissions of ammonia and <b>nuisance</b> <b>odours,</b> and kill harmful pathogens. A reactor concept was developed for simultaneous treatment of separately collected liquid and solid fractions of pig manure. The liquid fraction is concentrated by evaporating the water using energy from the composting system {{and at the same}} time scrubbing ammonia from the composting off-gas by acidifying the urine to pH 4 with nitric acid. This results in two marketable products, a concentrated liquid nitrogen fertiliser (NH 4 NO 3) without phosphorus, and a stabilised, solid organic fertiliser, which is free of pathogens and weeds. By connecting the two reactor systems, emissions of ammonia and odours are abated as ammonia emitted from the composting is trapped in the liquid fraction and odorous compounds emitted from the liquid are degraded in the composting reactor. The concept was physically simulated by coupling a 80 -L compost reactor to a 10 -L bubble column. Operation of the bench-scale system showed that the concept is very promising. All nutrients were captured, and emissions of ammonia and odours were almost completely abated...|$|R

Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study is to investigate perception of <b>odour</b> as a <b>nuisance</b> among residents in relation to their distance from a landfill. A survey is conducted, and 507 respondents living within a 7. 0 kilometre radius from the landfill participated. Questionnaires are sent out to the respondents to investigate their background, socioeconomic status, and perception on odour. The selected landfill is semi-aerobic and is used for the disposal of non-hazardous domestic and industrial wastes. Respondents for radius < 0. 9 km are employees of the landfill. Based on survey results, almost 26 % of the respondents strongly agree that ‘odour is a nuisance’. The level of agreement on ‘odour is a nuisance’ decreases with distance; that is, even respondents (1 %) who live within 6. 0 – 6. 9 km agree to this perception. A possible reason is that odour concentration is not only high at the origin/source, but also emanates from waste collection and transportation. Respondent perception on ‘odour is a nuisance’ is investigated in terms of race, age, type of house, education, occupation, and income...|$|R

40|$|In Australia, {{factors such}} as local {{planning}} processes, urban encroachment into rural areas and intensification of the poultry industry have increased the potential for <b>odour</b> and dust <b>nuisance.</b> At present, accurate estimates of odour emissions from mechanically ventilated poultry housing systems do not exist for Australian conditions. This has made the poultry industry vulnerable to unsubstantiated criticism. Recently, the Australian poultry industry have made a significant investment in research to obtain accurate estimates of odour, dust and volatile chemical emission rates from typical poultry housing systems. This paper describes the measurement of odour emissions from tunnel ventilated poultry housing systems in different climatic zones in Queensland and Victoria, Australia (humid sub-tropical and Mediterranean respectively) during two seasons (summer and winter). Samples were collected at defined intervals over typical batch production cycles to define the odour emission profiles. These samples were analysed using dynamic olfactometry according to the Australian Standard 4323. 3 to derive the odour concentration values. Ventilation rates were measured concurrently, allowing the calculation of odour emission rates. Odour concentration and emission rates were assessed in terms of ventilation rate, ambient and shed air temperature and relative humidity and litter moisture status.

Hereby 710 households have been randomly selected from a previous survey data base containing 2 800 urban households. About one third of the Brazzaville households are involved in urban agriculture with 29. 5 % households reporting crop production activities and 8. 8 % animal production activities. Within animal production, aviculture activities are dominant. Gardening and vegetable production play also an important role. The confl ict situation of 1997 affected negatively urban agricultural production in particular the animal production. Although, urban agriculture is present among different social and professional categories, there is a clear dominance of subsistence and poor households, especially those already active in agriculture before. In contrast to crop production, mainly practised for subsistence reasons, the motivation for animal production is driven more by the income than by the own consumption possibilities. The results also indicate that assuring a sustainable and equitable urban development is possible by a good balance between those practising urban {{agriculture and}} those not.

40|$|Exposure to {{environmental}} odour {{can result in}} annoyance, health effects and depreciation of property values. Therefore, many jurisdictions classify odour as an atmospheric pollutant and regulate emissions and/or impacts from odour generating activities at a national, state or municipal level. In this work, a critical review of odour regulations in selected jurisdictions of 28 countries is presented. Individual approaches were identified as: comparing ambient air odour concentration and individual chemicals statistics against impact criteria (maximum impact standard); using fixed and variable separation distances (separation distance standard); maximum emission rate for mixtures of odorants and individual chemical species (maximum emission standard); number of complaints received or annoyance level determined via community surveys (maximum annoyance standard); and requiring use of best available technologies (BAT) to minimize odour emissions (technology standard). The comparison of model-predicted odour concentration statistics against odour impact criteria (OIC) is identified {{as one of the}} most common tools used by regulators to evaluate the risk of odour impacts in planning stage assessments and is also used to inform assessment of odour impacts of existing facilities. Special emphasis is given to summarizing OIC (concentration percentile and threshold) and the manner in which they are applied. The way short term odour peak to model time-step mean (peak-to-mean) effects is also captured. Furthermore, the fundamentals of odorant properties, dimensions of <b>nuisance</b> <b>odour,</b> odour sampling and analysis methods and dispersion modelling guidance are provided.

40|$|Establishing an {{environmental}} policy for industrial sources usually commences with a {{regulation of the}} large point sources. Attention is then focused on piped emissions, e. g. exhaust gases directed via a stack and wastewater through a discharge pipe. In general these piped missions are well regulated and have been reduced substantially, {{to such an extent}} that the other emissions have become more and more dominating. With respect to atmospheric emissions of volatile organic emissions (VOC) these other emissions comprise mainly leakage from equipment (fugitive emissions) and evaporation losses of storage, loading and unloading. These emissions are called diffuse emissions. Monitoring of diffuse emissions is more complex compared with monitoring of piped emission sources. Abatement and regulation of diffuse emissions is a relatively new issue in some member states of the European Union (EU). It is however not common practice in all EU member states, this contrary to the USA where it is common practice for about 10 - 20 years. The main environmental effect of VOC in general is their role in the formation of smog and ozone in the presence of nitrogen oxides. VOC in the ambient air are precursors to the formation of ground level (tropospheric) ozone, the primary constituent of smog. Smog and ozone cause respiratory damage, damage to property and vegetation (agriculture and ecosystems). Individual components of VOC are known for other negative effects such as toxic effects on health and ozone layer depletion in the stratosphere. Reduction of VOC emissions is not only beneficiary to the environment but also can lead to better workplace conditions, can reduce risks of fire, can reduce <b>nuisance</b> (<b>odours)</b> and can save money. IMPEL, the environmental inspectors network for the EU, has defined a project on diffuse emissions. The intention is to provide guidelines for implementing diffuse emissions regulations, both for licensing of industrial plants and for enforcement.

In this work, the odour emission factors (OEFs) for the rendering industry are determined based on experimental data obtained by means of dynamic olfactometry. An OEF is a representative value that relates the quantity of odour released to the atmosphere to a given associated activity. The odour emission factors were calculated to be equal to 4. 52 × 108 ouE t− 1 for process air, to 8. 02 × 107 ouE t− 1 for a mixture of process air and ambient air, and to 3. 53 × 103 ouE t− 1 for wastewater treatment tanks. Furthermore, the efficiencies of different odour abatement systems used for the treatment of different gaseous emissions from this kind of facility are evaluated and compared.

40|$|Two {{classes of}} {{dispersion}} models are currently used for (regulatory) odour dispersion, namely Gauss and Lagrange models.

Over the last years, the authors have developed an approach where the shortterm peaks are parameterized according to atmospheric stability (“peak-to-mean” factors).

With the German Lagrange model LASAT {{as well as with}} the AUSTAL 2000 model, a factor 4 is used independent of the distance from the source and the meteorological conditions to account for short-term peak concentrations.

Laboratory analysis methods (dilution olfactometry) have been established to quantitatively assess odour intensity. However assigning a numerical value to an odour does not provide information relating to its chemical composition or character. An understanding of the chemical composition of the odour is required to better manage the emissions from an operation. While identifying the emitted chemical species provides useful information; {{the key to understanding}} the odour is establishing which of the chemical species are odorants. The use of gas-chromatography with simultaneous mass spectral and olfactory detection provides a method of identifying the chemical species present along with their odour potential. Extensive field sampling of broiler and layer facilities was performed to develop an understanding of the emissions of poultry houses. The broiler houses yielded greater chemical diversity and abundance than the layer houses. NMVOCs identified within the emissions included alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids and terpines. Gains were made in understanding the fate of specific odorants and NMVOCs and the potential impact on emissions. Although beyond the initial scope of the research, interpreting the presence of disulphide species within the emissions was essential to interpreting the overall odour profile. Experimental results reflected a plausible correlation between disulphide presence in samples and thiol presence in the field. Whilst significant laboratory analysis methodological developments were made and an extensive database of results established; the variety of chemical species and abundances between sampling campaigns was a significant result. This variability has identified the need to further investigate litter material of broiler houses as a potential source of <b>nuisance</b> <b>odour</b> emissions...|$|R
40|$|For {{many centuries}} urban waste {{management}} in Europe and Northern America consisted of private – to – private arrangements to remove waste {{from the city}} centre and so restrain the spread of cholera and other diseases, <b>odour</b> and <b>nuisances.</b> The agricultural and industrial value chains provided a destination and a motivation to extract and valorise rags, ashes, dust, excreta, metals, food scraps, and many other forms of secondary resources which had some value to someone. The business of recycling developed alongside of municipal waste management, and absorbed many discarded materials, but remained a separate sector with its own practices, institutions, and economic rationality. The management of solid waste management became primarily focused on dumping waste outside the city boundaries. The ‘discovery’ {{of the relationship between}} open dumping and groundwater contamination in the 1960 s {{set the stage for a}} round of modernisation of waste management practices and institutions in high-income countries. The widely recognised and celebrated result was the shift from open dumping and open burning of waste to the engineered “regional sanitary landfill” as a large technical facility that concentrates waste, isolates it from population centres, protects ground-water and thus allows for safe modern disposal of increasingly complex materials. This proved to be a costly affair though, and  triggered a process of ecological modernisation in solid waste management characterised by institutional and financial reforms, which elevated the cost of removal. Disposal became costly, and as cities expanded, land to dump became a scarce resource. This set the stage for incorporating valorisation into the modernised waste management landscape as an alternative to modernised disposal.   The ecological modernisation process that took place in Northern Europe and North America in the 1980 s and early 1990 s changed the policies and practices of waste management in fundamental but seldom understood ways. Pricing of disposal in high-income countries represents a core financial reform which in turn stimulates local authorities to invest in their own recycling (composting, reuse) infrastructure as a lower-cost and environmentally attractive alternative. Municipal recycling emerges as a key modernised institution in the landscape of integrated waste management, where investment in recycling produces higher and higher recovery rates and a virtuous circle of more investment, more recovery, less waste, co-operation with the value chains which have been re-constituted as “recycling markets,” and lower system costs. In municipal recycling, the agricultural and industrial value chains function as alternative and lower-cost sinks, complementing the landfill and lowering costs for the whole waste management system. In low- and middle-income countries, in contrast, the ecological modernisation of solid waste is problematic and incomplete, and ‘recycling’ becomes a key new area of global conflict. Priced disposal does not come about, either because of low levels of disposable income or unwillingness of elected officials to impose a burden on tax- and rate-payers, or because the motivation to modernise disposal comes from global institutions and is insufficiently embedded in genuinely local policymaking. Without it the system-internal benefits of diverting materials from disposal to valorisation are missing. Municipal recycling does not emerge, and the virtuous cycle of increasing recovery ambitions and performance is replaced by a vicious cycle of interrupted private value chain transactions, declining valorisation rates, and increasing volumes of materials requiring expensive disposal. City authorities in low- and middle-income countries seeking to gain the financial benefits of selling materials compete with private (informal) waste pickers, recyclers, and livestock feeding operations, claim monopoly rights to materials, and criminalise value chain activities. But  they are unable to organise effective valorisation themselves, as they lack knowledge and commercial channels to reach the value chains. The value chain actors are blamed for not buying materials, but also for exploiting poor workers in miserable working conditions. Valorisation businesses are unwilling to do business with municipalities who supply low-quality materials, so the value chain transactions fail, and both avoided costs of disposal and offsetting revenues from valorisation remain elusive. Municipalities, waste system users, and the environment lose in this situation when local authorities are unable to pay landfill operating costs, and the expensive sanitary landfill infrastructure reverts to the status of a pre-modern dumpsite, which has to handle more and more waste. Agricultural and industrial value chains also suffer, because the thousands of individual and family enterprises in waste picking, recycling, and animal feeding are at risk to lose their livelihoods, or see reduced returns on their efforts due to monopoly behaviour, criminalisation, or harassment from the formal waste system actors. Mid-level value chain enterprises get fewer materials, and increasing volumes of potentially recoverable resources end up in the dump. But there are already some examples of how changing the model can produce improved results. In a small number of cities in low- and middle-income countries, the ecological modernisation of the waste management system appears to be leading to the emergence of a new model for institutionalised valorisation, provisionally called inclusive recycling. Inclusive recycling is a model for public sector acceptance of private value chain activities of valorisation. It is  a model of shared ownership, risks, and benefits, where each set of actors does what they are best at. While it builds upon the techniques for participatory planning and stakeholder engagement, as well as on technical innovations for separate collection, processing, and environmental education that characterised the development of municipal recycling in the 1980 s in OECD countries, inclusive recycling does not rely on the institutional reform of priced disposal.   Rather, it maintains the centre of gravity of valorisation activities in the industrial or agricultural value chains, where the knowledge and infrastructure exists to receive, process, and market materials. Instead of re-inventing recycling as a part of the municipal solid waste department’s responsibilities, inclusive recycling looks to intermediary institutions such as labour unions or recycling co-operatives to facilitate shared risks and responsibilities between local authorities and value chain actors. Inclusive recycling can be seen in some of its emerging forms in Asia and Latin America, particularly in situations where there is a tradition of co-operation between civil society and local authorities, large numbers of waste pickers at the base of the value chain pyramid, and where the paper and metal value chains are long, healthy, and deeply rooted.   In place of a single municipal recycling system, inclusive recycling is a mixed system where there are many different types of actors, economic niches, and business models. The results may be high levels of recovery and diversion from disposal, making it comparable to municipal recycling as a modernised institution. Like municipal recycling, inclusive recycling contributes to the pluralism of the modernised system, with a proliferation of actors, activities, and economic niches, which qualify it as what ecological modernization scholars have called a ‘modernised mixture’. However, inclusive recycling is not municipal recycling, and in the absence of priced disposal, the risks for both local authorities and value chain actors remain high. Combining global knowledge with local control of ecological modernisation processes is one approach to keeping the risks limited and enlarging the space for the virtuous circle of inclusive recycling to take root and flourish.   ...|$|R
40|$|At South East Water {{wastewater}} treatment plants (WwTPs) in Victoria, Australia, biosolids are stockpiled for three years {{in compliance with the}} State guidelines to achieve the highest pathogen reduction grade (T 1), suitable for unrestricted use in agriculture and landscaping. However, extended stockpiling is costly, may increase <b>odour</b> <b>nuisance</b> and greenhouse gas emissions, and reduces the fertiliser value of the biosolids. A verification programme of sampling and analysis for enteric pathogens was conducted at two WwTPs where sludge is treated by aerobic and anaerobic digestion, air drying (in drying pans or solar drying sheds) and stockpiling, to enumerate and, if present, monitor the decay of a range of enteric pathogens and parasites. The sludge treatment processes at both WwTPs achieved T 1 grade biosolids with respect to prescribed pathogenic bacterial numbers (3 log 10 enteric virus reduction after a storage period of one year. No Ascaris eggs were detected in the influent to the WwTPs, confirming previous studies that the presence of helminth infections in Victoria is extremely low and that Ascaris is not applicable as a control criterion for the microbiological quality of biosolids in the region...|$|E
