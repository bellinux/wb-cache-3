The focus is on some specific demand-enhancing effects which should confirm the feasibility of implementing sustainable tourism policies. Multinomial logit estimations reveal the strong negative effects resulting from the congestion of tourist attractions and the major transformation of coastal environments. On the <b>other</b> hand, <b>recreational</b> <b>services</b> and the proximity of accommodation to the beaches also seem to be important. The computation of willingness to pay measures and choice probabilities for hypothetical destinations illustrate how this kind of approach can provide useful information in determining decision processes by policy makers and development agencies. tourism demand, green preferences, choice experiments, stated preferences...|$|R

The paper also argues that developments in other sectors (telecommunication, advertising, computer and related services, <b>other</b> <b>recreational</b> <b>services),</b> the horizontal agreement on e-commerce and technology affect both the relevance and the means of regulation in the audiovisual sector. It is suggested that supporting local production rather than restricting foreign market access is the most effective way of pursuing cultural policy objectives...|$|E

Our results also show that the income elasticities for traditional goods are stable over time, indicating that consumer preferences for expenditure on these specific commodities do not change over time.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to analyze the effect brought about by the {{promulgation}} of the British Local Government Act of 1988 on the maintenance of parks and <b>recreational</b> <b>services.</b> The Act made it compulsory to local authorities to expose the maintenance of parks and <b>recreational</b> <b>services</b> to a tendering process, commonly known as compulsory competitive tendering. The implementation of compulsory competitive tendering had to be done between the promulgation of the Act in 1988, and 1994. With regard to this period, a perception existed that the standard of the administration of the maintenance of parks and <b>recreational</b> <b>services</b> declined. The research was done to determine if the implementation of compulsory competitive tendering on the maintenance of parks and <b>recreational</b> <b>services</b> could have resulted in a decline in the standard of the administration of the services, and how it could have happened. It was determined that the motive of the British Government at the time of implementation of the compulsory competitive tendering was primarily to save money. The result of the implementation of compulsory competitive legislation on the maintenance of parks and <b>recreational</b> <b>services</b> were amongst <b>other</b> things: - low morale of staff who were pressured to change - culture changes necessary to comply to compulsory competitive organisational structures - legislation that influenced the lives of traditional local authority employees drastically, and - the development of a new approach to financial management to comply to the government's expectations of saving money.

40|$|Little {{attention}} has been given to the effect of <b>recreational</b> <b>services</b> on reducing the impact of stress among frail elders. The purpose of this research was to assess whether <b>recreational</b> <b>services</b> buffer the impact of stress on the well-being of noninstitutionalized frail elderly. Two samples were drawn based upon a functional assessment as measured by an activities of daily living (ADL) scale from the Study of Older People in Cleveland, Ohio. Multiple regression equations were utilized for each group to determine whether the effects of stress were reduced by participation in <b>recreational</b> <b>services.</b> The results revealed that <b>recreational</b> <b>services</b> mediated and buffered the level of stress among both groups of elderly people. However, the more impaired ADL group benefitted the most. Implications for practice and future research are discussed. Given the increasing aged population, and therefore the increasing number of frail elderly, the task of maintaining elderly persons in the community requires specific social supports to minimize dependence and to assist in the promotion of well-being. The study of social supports, life stress, and well-being has been a major topic for research in the field of gerontology in recent years. Such research is important, as the results can influence an...|$|R

30|$|On a {{societal}} level, {{the development of}} <b>recreational</b> <b>services</b> within ECEC policies takes part in the broader process of defamilisation (McLaughlin and Glendinning 1994) that has progressively externalised the care of children. Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden are clearly the first countries to have combined this externalisation of care of young children {{with the development of}} relevant public policies (Millar and Warman 1996; Leira 2002). Mothers’ increased participation to the labour market created a need for childcare solutions outside of the home. From an exclusive responsibility of families, the care of young children has thus shifted towards a shared responsibility with public authorities that has {{led to the development of}} distinct ECEC policies in Europe, concerning childcare and preschool <b>services</b> (Leira 2002). <b>Recreational</b> <b>services</b> have followed thereafter and, in the Scandinavian welfare system where an expanding proportion of children are using <b>recreational</b> <b>services,</b> childhood is more and more becoming an “institutionalised” experience (Rasmussen 2004).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an application of}} an environment valuation technique known as the Travel Cost Model on the <b>recreational</b> <b>service</b> flows of Kuala Selangor Nature Park (KSNP) and the adjacent fireflies recreation at Kampong Kuantan. The model attempts to estimate the economic value of the on-site current use value of <b>recreational</b> <b>services</b> for both the KSNP and the fireflies recreation. These resources are highlighted {{in the light of}} the current debate on a dam construction proposal up the Selangor River. The dam project might pose negative repercussions on the two resources, in particular the fireflies recreation which are located downstream the Selangor River. Ignoring the economic values of <b>recreational</b> <b>services</b> as well as other critical environmental functions might lead to bias estimates of the project’s Economic Internal Rate of Return favouring resource conversion (the dam project). The annual aggregate net benefits for the fireflies and KSNP <b>recreational</b> <b>services</b> were estimated at RM 2. 2 mill and RM 0. 9 mill, respectively. The high net benefits suggest that the recreational functions of wetlands or forest resources ought to be given serious consideration in decisions affecting the allocation and use of such resources. In the context of project analysis, environmental valuation provides policy-makers with an added perspective in decision making- to view a project in terms of social gains and losses, expressed in money metric...|$|R
