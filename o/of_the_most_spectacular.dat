5|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>spectacular</b> {{features}} of Justinian's reign was {{the recovery of}} large stretches of land around the Western Mediterranean basin that had slipped out of Imperial control in the 5th century. As a Christian Roman emperor, Justinian considered it his divine duty to restore the Roman Empire to its ancient boundaries. Although he never personally took part in military campaigns, he boasted of his successes in the prefaces to his laws and had them commemorated in art. The re-conquests were in large part carried out by his general Belisarius.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} four seasons, the Colts won 48 of 64 games, but still could not find much success in the postseason. In 2002, they were blown out 41–0 in the wild card round by the New York Jets. In 2003, they won their first two playoff games behind {{impressive}} offensive performances, and reached the AFC title game. There, they lost to the eventual champion New England Patriots 24–14, with Manning throwing four interceptions. In 2004, the Colts had one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>spectacular</b> offensive seasons in NFL history, scoring 522 points and gaining 6,582 yards, while Manning set NFL records for most touchdown passes and highest passer rating. But again the Patriots' defense (and snowy conditions) proved too formidable, as they lost 20–3 in the divisional round of the playoffs.|$|E

5|$|Much of Galveston's {{success as}} a tourist {{destination}} {{was the result of}} E. Sid Holliday, who became the publicity and convention director of the Galveston Chamber of Commerce in 1925 and later became its head. The Chamber helped promote the legitimate face of Galveston's tourism and business community (though it cooperated heavily with the criminal enterprises). Legitimate amusements such as an amusement park that included a Ferris wheel and a roller coaster (the Mountain Speedway), in addition to the beaches and up-scale shopping districts (notably the Strand) drew visitors, including those less interested in the city's illegal attractions. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>spectacular</b> efforts by the Chamber, though not one of the city's greatest successes, was the Pleasure Pier (originally known as the Brantly Harris Recreational Pier). This huge pier (later converted to the Flagship Hotel), built in the 1940s and used by the military {{until the end of the}} war, featured restaurants, rides, and an amphitheater.|$|E

25|$|The Maipes {{necropolis}} is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>spectacular</b> burial {{sites on}} the island. It covers more than one square km with around 600 or 700 or more small tumuli, dating from the 8th to 10th centuries.

25|$|Nemrut is {{considered}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>spectacular</b> volcanoes in the region. Its caldera can be accessed in the summer on 4x4 vehicles from the south or east side. Nemrut is covered with snow five months per year, and therefore the Turkish authorities are building a mountain ski resort and a 2,517 m long ski track {{on the slopes of}} Nemrut.|$|E
25|$|The most {{impressive}} {{part of the}} holiday is the carnival. Purim in Israel is perhaps one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>spectacular</b> holidays in the world. Thousands of people take to the streets, showing off their costumes that they made especially for the holiday. Costumes at Purim are a special industry in Israel, and during this period the prices go up, which means Israelis try to buy their costumes in advance.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, stock market speculators, hoping that Nortel would reap {{increasingly}} lucrative {{profits from the}} sale of fibre optic network gear, began pushing up the company's share price to unheard-of levels despite the company's repeated failure to turn a profit. Under the leadership of CEO John Roth, sales of optical equipment had been robust in the late 1990s, but the market was soon saturated. When the speculative telecom bubble of the late 1990s reached its pinnacle late in the year 2000, Nortel was to become one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>spectacular</b> casualties.|$|E

25|$|The tomb of Yuya and Tjuyu was, {{until the}} {{discovery}} of Tutankhamun's, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>spectacular</b> ever found in the Valley of the Kings despite Yuya not even being a pharaoh. Although the burial site was robbed in antiquity, many objects not considered worth plundering by the robbers remained. Both the mummies were largely intact and were in an amazing state of preservation. Their faces in particular were relatively undistorted {{by the process of}} mummification, and provide an extraordinary insight into the actual appearance of the deceased while alive (see photographs).|$|E
25|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>spectacular</b> {{building}} collapses {{was that}} of the Conjunto Pino Suárez, which was a complex of five steel-frame buildings. A 20-story tower, Tower Four, doubled over at the third floor and fell south onto a fourteen-story building. The fall left a huge piece of concrete blocking the road that leads to the Zócalo. People at the scene stated that there was simply no time to run and escape the building's fall. The other three 20-story buildings were closed because of damage, as well as the Metro entrance next door. The building was occupied by family courts and offices of the public defender. The area now is a commercial center.|$|E
25|$|Situated on {{the western}} side of the suburb of Gwelup, lies the {{remainder}} of the once broader Lake Gwelup and accompanying bushland nature reserve. As one of the few wetlands that has a mostly intact native bushland, Lake Gwelup is home {{to a wide variety of}} local and visitor birds (waders, raptors, ducks etc.) as well many frogs (notably Moaning Frogs Heleioporus eyrei), reptile species (e.g. dugites, skinks and long necked turtles). Native flora in the bushland include Marri (Corymbia calophylla), Jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata), Flooded Gum (E. rudis), Tuart (E. gomphocephela) as well as at least four species of Banksia, many annual wildflowers (incl. orchids) and fungi. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>spectacular</b> species of visiting birds is the Rainbow Bee-eater (Merops ornatus).|$|E

This competition has been reinitiated in 2014.|$|R
50|$|There was a {{total of}} fifteen expeditions to Anyang before work was {{interrupted}} by the Sino-Japanese War.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that Hagedorn's {{bootstrap}} should not be applied to hadronic matter at densities large against nuclear densities. <b>The</b> correct predictions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thermodynamical model do not use any relation between <b>the</b> mass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fireballs and their size, whereas the astrophysical applications depend on the unreasonable assumption that the size is independent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mass. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>spectacular</b> prediction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bootstrap, namely violent black hole explosions yielding 10 /sup 15 / g in the last millisecond, is shown to be completely unfounded, even if such an assumption is made.
