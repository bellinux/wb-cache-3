25|$|Botnica {{was one of}} {{the first}} icebreakers to be {{equipped}} with Azipod propulsion, ABB's brand of electric azimuth thrusters developed in Finland. The two 5 MW Azipod VI1600A units considerably improve the maneuverability of the icebreaker — the tactical diameter of the turning circle in open water is less than the overall length of the ship. This is especially useful during escort and assistance operations in difficult ice conditions when the icebreaker has to operate at close proximity to other vessels at low speeds. Together with three 1,150-kW Brunvoll FU-80-LTC-2000 variable-pitch bow thrusters the azimuth thrusters also allow dynamic positioning during <b>offshore</b> <b>operations.</b> The bow thrusters are not used in ice.|$|E

25|$|On 26 September 2000, {{the first}} order for the type was placed by Bristow Helicopters. The first {{preproduction}} helicopter flew on 3 February 2001 at Vergiate in Italy, with two further AW139s also participating in flying trials. The first production AW139 made its first flight on 24 June 2002. European JAA certification was received in June 2003, and its FAA type certificate followed in December 2004. By May 2005, the AW139 had received in excess of 100 orders worldwide. In the US, the type was marketed under the designation US139, and was entered into the US Army's Light Utility Helicopter competition. One key market for the AW139 was the oil & gas industry, which required helicopters of increased endurance for <b>offshore</b> <b>operations.</b> In 2005, AgustaWestland bought out Bell's 25% share in the program {{and all of its}} rights to the AW139 for $95 million.|$|E
25|$|The chief {{operator}} {{of the type}} was Pawan Hans of India. The British government agreed with India to supply 21 Westland 30s for oil exploration duties using a British grant of 65 million pounds.

The aircraft were delivered to Pawan Hans between 1986 and 1988 for <b>offshore</b> <b>operations</b> on behalf of the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC). A similar number of SA 365N Dauphin helicopters was supplied by France. It was soon found that the Westland helicopters were ill-suited to Indian conditions, and after two fatal accidents, the fleet was grounded in 1991. The 19 surviving Westland 30s were sold to a British company, but after six had been shipped to the United Kingdom, the deal fell through, and the aircraft are believed to remain in storage in the United Kingdom and India.|$|E

40|$|Effective {{coordination}} is {{an important}} determinant of performance in globally dispersed <b>offshored</b> <b>operations.</b> This is an under-researched area particularly regarding the contextual factors that drive the choice of coordinating modes, and whether the most effective coordinating modes depend on the specific context. This study explores the intra- and inter-organizational coordinating modes of 15 subsidiaries of Italian-owned companies located in Argentina, investigating the link between coordinating modes and types of <b>offshored</b> <b>operations.</b> Intra-organizational coordination is mainly between the Argentine subsidiary and Italian headquarters, while inter-organizational coordination is with global suppliers and those local to the Argentine subsidiary. The analysis has found that when only sales is offshored, intra-organizational coordination is heavily centralized with the headquarters. However, when manufacturing is also offshored, other internal modes of coordination are needed and inter-organizational coordination with local and global suppliers becomes important. The most promising practices depend on contextual factors like product features (e. g. technological content), production cost structure (import duties), local economic conditions (e. g. exchange rates and local economic instability), regulations (trade agreements), infrastructure, and subsidiary size. The paper provides a unique contribution by investigating both intra- and inter-organizational subsidiary coordinating modes, and by {{taking into account the}} impact of contextual factors on such decisions. The results lead to six propositions for further investigation on network structure and coordination in <b>offshored</b> <b>operations...</b>|$|R

Finstaship's share of the new company was 34%. In 2005 Botnica was chartered to TSMarine for <b>offshore</b> <b>operations</b> in the North Sea. The contract specified that the vessel would spend [...] "at least" [...] 560 days in <b>offshore</b> <b>operations</b> between 2005 and 2007.

2500|$|There are no {{accurate}} size {{data collected}} on the catches from fishing, aside from limited port sampling by the National Marine Fisheries Service.

However, during summer months, large Yellowfin tuna are more abundant. The weight of the catches are estimated to be about 75% Thunnus obesus (Bigeye tuna), and 25% T. albacares (Yellowfin tuna). According to estimates, about 1 million pounds of Bigeye tuna and 400,000 pounds of Yellowfin were fished from <b>offshore</b> <b>operations</b> from the region in 1995.
