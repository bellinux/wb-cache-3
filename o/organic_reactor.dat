40|$|Numerous {{advanced}} reactor concepts {{have been proposed}} to replace light water reactors ever since their establishment as the dominant technology for nuclear energy production. While most designs seek to improve cost competitiveness and safety, the implausibility of doing so with affordable materials or existing nuclear fuel infrastructure reduces the possibility of near-term deployment, especially in developing countries. The organic nuclear concept, first explored in the 1950 s, offers an attractive alternative to {{advanced reactor}} designs being considered. The advent of high temperature fluids, along with advances in hydrocracking and reforming technologies driven by {{the oil and gas}} industries, make the organic concept even more viable today. We present a simple, cost-effective, and safe small modular nuclear reactor for offshore underwater deployment. The core is moderated by graphite, zirconium hydride, and organic fluid while cooled by the organic fluid. The organic coolant enables operation near atmospheric pressure and use of plain carbon steel for the reactor tank and primary coolant piping system. The core is designed to mitigate the coolant degradation seen in early <b>organic</b> <b>reactors.</b> Overall, the design provides a power density of 40 Â kW/L, while reducing the reactor hull size by 40 % compared with a pressurized water reactor while significantly reducing capital plant costs...|$|R

40|$|As part of {{a program}} to develop an {{economical}} fuel cycle for an <b>Organic</b> Moderated <b>Reactor</b> (OMR), experimental fuel elements are being irradiated in the <b>Organic</b> Moderated <b>Reactor</b> Experiment (OMRE). The first two experimental fuel elements {{have been removed from}} the OMRE, examined, and evaluated. These extended-surface, platetype fuel elements had finned aluminum cladding, metallurgically bonded to flat uranium alloy fuel plates. A 0. 0005 in. nickel layer was used to prevent interdiffusion between the aluminum and uranium. The fuel core alloys irradiated were U [...] 5. 5 % Mo and U [...] 3. 5 % Mo [...] 0. 5 % Si. These two experimental elements were removed from the reactor after one of the elements released fission products, and cladding temperatures increased on both fuel elements. The maximum measured cladding temperature was 780 deg F. The maximum fuel burnup was later determined to be 0. 25 at. % U. Hot-cell examination revealed that the coolant inlet ends of the fuel elements had filtered particulate matter out of the coolant, which blocked the ends of the coolant channels. Restriction of the coolant flow through the elements caused partial melting of the cladding in one fuel element and a blister on one of the fuel plates from the other fuel element. Dimensions were taken on three of the fuel plates. Metallographic sections from the blistered fuel plates were examined, and burnup profiles were determined for the three plates measured. The fuel had good dimensional stability, which is significant, since the melted cladding and the core microstructure evidenced temperatures substantially above the maximurn temperatures recorded by thermocouples. Nothing was observed that would indicate the fuel elements would not have functioned properly in the same coolant if the coolant were free of particulate matter of sizes that could be trapped.

40|$|In this study, {{the impact}} of COD/N ratio and feeding regime on the {{dynamics}} of heterotrophs and nitrifiers in moving-bed biofilm reactors was addressed. Based on DGGE analysis of 16 S rRNA genes, the influent COD {{was found to be}} the main factor determining the overall bacterial diversity. The amoA-gene-based analysis suggested that the dynamic behavior of the substrate in continuous and pulse-feeding reactors influenced the selection of specific ammonium-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) strains. Furthermore, AOB diversity was directly related to the applied COD/N ratio and ammonium-nitrogen load. Maximum specific ammonium oxidation rates observed under non-substrate-limiting conditions were observed to be proportional to the fraction of nitrifiers within the bacterial community. FISH analysis revealed that Nitrosomonas genus dominated the AOB community in all reactors.

40|$|The AECL, Whiteshell Laboratory (WL) near Pinawa Manitoba, Canada, was {{established}} in the early 1960 's to carry out AECL research and development activities for higher temperature versions of the CANDU{reg_sign} reactor. The initial focus of the research program was the Whiteshell Reactor- 1 (WR- 1) <b>Organic</b> Cooled <b>Reactor</b> (OCR) that began operation in 1965. The OCR program was discontinued in the early 1970 's in favor of the successful heavy-water-cooled CANDU system. WR- 1 continued to operate until 1985 in support of AECL nuclear research programs. A consequence of the Federal government's recent program review process was AECL's business decision to discontinue research programs and operations at the Whiteshell Laboratories and to consolidate its' activities at the Chalk River Laboratories. As a result, AECL received government concurrence in 1998 to proceed to plan actions to achieve closure of WL. The planning actions now in progress address the need to safely and effectively transition the WL site from an operational state, in support of AECL's business, to a shutdown and decommissioned state that meets the regulatory requirements for a licensed nuclear site. The decommissioning program that will be required at WL is unique within AECL and Canada since it will need to address the entire research site rather than individual facilities declared redundant. Accordingly, the site nuclear facilities are being systematically placed in a safe shutdown state and planning for the decommissioning work to place the facilities in a secure monitoring and surveillance state is in progress. One aspect of the shutdown activities is to deal with the legacy of radioactively contaminated organic liquid wastes.
