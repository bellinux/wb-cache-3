5|$|Hulk Hogan's visibly damaged eye was {{explained}} in the storyline as the result <b>of</b> <b>Ted</b> DiBiase hiring {{a group of men}} to attack Hogan before the match. In reality, the cause of injury has been open to debate. One theory is that Randy Savage punched Hogan because he believed that his ex-wife Elizabeth Hulette had an affair with Hogan while Savage and Hulette were married (the couple divorced in September 1992). WWF officials claimed that the injury {{was the result of a}} Jet Ski accident.|$|E

5|$|His {{first-class}} {{career was}} confined to his university years, when he appeared for both Oxford and Somerset. Close {{to the top of}} the bowling averages for both teams in each season, his 62 first-class wickets in 1885 placed him among the 20 most prolific wicket-takers in the country. Somerset's temporary loss of first-class status in 1885 brought a premature end to Bastard's first-class career when he was 23. Although he continued to play for the side in second-class cricket until 1889, by the time Somerset resumed first-class cricket in 1891, Bastard had lost his place following the emergence of Sammy Woods and the acquisitions <b>of</b> <b>Ted</b> Tyler and George Nichols.

In December 2008, Maryse won her first WWE Divas Championship and held it for seven months, which is the third longest reign in the championship's history. In April 2009, she was drafted to the Raw brand, and won the WWE Divas Championship {{for the second time in}} February 2010, making her the first wrestler to have held the championship on more than one occasion.

25|$|With these definitions, the resolvent set <b>of</b> <b>T</b> is {{the set of}} all complex numbers ζ {{such that}} Rζ exists and is bounded. This set often is denoted as ρ(T).

The function Rζ for all ζ in ρ(T) (that is, wherever Rζ exists as a bounded operator) is called the resolvent <b>of</b> <b>T.</b> The spectrum <b>of</b> <b>T</b> is therefore the complement of the resolvent set <b>of</b> <b>T</b> in the complex plane.
