40|$|The hormone leptin is {{produced}} by adipose tissue and can function as a signal of nutritional status to the reproductive sys-tem. The expression of leptin receptor and, in some species, lep-tin, in the placenta suggests a role for leptin in placental devel-opment, but this role has not been elucidated. Leptin is required {{at the time of}} embryo implantation in the leptin-deficient ob/ <b>ob</b> <b>mouse</b> and has been shown to upregulate expression of ma-trix metalloproteinases (MMPs), enzymes involved in tropho-blast invasion, in cultured human trophoblast cells. This led us to the hypothesis that leptin promotes the invasiveness of tro-phoblast cells crucial to placental development. We found that leptin stimulated mouse trophoblast cell invasion through a ma-trigel-coated insert on Day 10, but not Day 18 of pregnancy. Optimal stimulation occurred at a concentration of 50 ng/ml leptin, similar to the peak plasma leptin concentration during pregnancy in the mouse. Leptin treatment did not stimulate pro-liferation of mouse trophoblast cells in primary culture. Leptin stimulation of invasion was prevented by 25 mM GM 6001, an inhibitor of MMP activity. Our results suggest that leptin {{may play a role in}} the establishment of the placenta during early pregnancy and that this function is dependent on MMP activity. This effect of leptin may represent one mechanism by which body condition affects placental development. implantation, invasion, leptin, matrix metalloproteinase, MMP, pregnancy, placenta, trophoblas...|$|E
40|$|Obese (ob) gene {{expression}} in abdominal subcutaneous adi-pocytes from lean and obese humans was examined. The full coding {{region of the}} ob gene was isolated from a human adipocyte cDNA library. Translation of the insert confirmed the reported amino acid sequence. There {{was no difference in}} the sequence of an reverse transcription PCR product of the coding region from five lean and five obese subjects. The nonsense mutation in the <b>ob</b> <b>mouse</b> which results in the conversion of arginine 105 to a stop codon was not present in human obesity. In all 10 human cDNAs, arginine 105 was encoded by CGG, consequently two nucleotide substitutions would be required to result in a stop codon. To compare the amount of ob {{gene expression}} in lean and obese individuals, radiolabed primer was used in the PCR reaction with (I-actin as a control. There was 72 % more ob gene expression (P < 0. 01) in eight obese subjects (body mass index, BMI = 42. 8 ± 2. 7) compared to eight lean controls (BMI = 22. 4 ± 0. 8). Regression analysis indicated a positive corre-lation between BMI and the amount of ob message (P < 0. 005). There was no difference in the amount of,B-actin expression in the two groups. These results provide evidence that ob gene expression is increased in human obesity; fur-thermore, the mutations present in the mouse ob gene were not detected in the human mRNA population. (J.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{hypothesized}} that the induction of heme oxygenase (HO) - 1 and increased HO activity, which induces arterial antioxidative enzymes and vasoprotection in a mouse and a rat model of diabetes, would ameliorate insulin resistance, obesity, and diabetes in the <b>ob</b> <b>mouse</b> model of type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Lean and ob mice were intraperitoneally administered the HO- 1 inducer cobalt protoporphyrin (3 mg/kg CoPP) with and without the HO inhibitor stannous mesoporphyrin (2 mg/ 100 g SnMP) {{once a week for}} 6 weeks. Body weight, blood glucose, and serum cytokines and adiponectin were measured. Aorta, adipose tissue, bone marrow, and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were isolated and assessed for HO expression and adipogenesis. RESULTS: HO activity was reduced in ob mice compared with age-matched lean mice. Administration of CoPP caused a sustained increase in HO- 1 protein, prevented weight gain, decreased visceral and subcutaneous fat content (P < 0. 03 and 0. 01, respectively, compared with vehicle animals), increased serum adiponectin, and decreased plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL) - 6, and IL- 1 beta levels (P < 0. 05). HO- 1 induction improved insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance and decreased insulin levels. Upregulation of HO- 1 decreased adipogenesis in bone marrow in vivo and in cultured MSCs and increased adiponectin levels in the culture media. Inhibition of HO activity decreased adiponectin and increased secretion of TNF-alpha, IL- 6, and IL- 1 beta levels in ob mice. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides strong evidence for the existence of an HO- 1 -adiponectin regulatory axis that can be manipulated to ameliorate the deleterious effects of obesity and the metabolic syndrome associated with cardiovascular disease and diabetes...|$|E
40|$|Obesity is {{associated}} with impaired functional hyperemic response. We have shown that ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels are important in mediating functional vasodilation. Adipocyte-derived factors (ADFs) can alter vascular tone via opening KATP channels. We hypothesize that, in an animal model of obesity, ADFs will decrease basal arteriolar tone by opening KATP channels, resulting in an attenuated functional vasodilation. We used wild-type (WT) mice and ob−/ob− <b>mice</b> (<b>ob)</b> to test this hypothesis. The spinotrapezius muscle was prepared for the microcirculatory observation of arcade arterioles, and we measured the vasodilatory responses to muscle stimulation. The basal arteriolar diameter was larger in <b>ob</b> <b>mice</b> compared with WT mice. The KATP channel inhibitor glibenclamide (10 μM) decreased arteriolar diameter in <b>ob</b> <b>mice</b> with no effect in WT mice.

In vivo insulin action was assessed in muscles of mice 15 min following an intraperitoneal injection of insulin or an equivalent volume of saline.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Human, but not mouse, islet amyloid {{polypeptide}} (IAPP) is amyloidogenic. Transgenic mice overexpressing human IAPP in {{the beta}} {{cells of the}} islets of Langerhans should be useful in identifying factors important for the deposition of IAPP as insoluble amyloid fibrils. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Transgenic mice expressing human IAPP were examined using several experimental models {{for the production of}} persistent hyperglycemia, {{as well as for the}} overstimulation and/or inhibition of beta cell secretion. Obesity was induced by aurothioglucose. Persistent hyperglycemia was produced by long-term administration of glucocorticosteroids or by partial pancreatectomy. Inhibition of normal beta cell exocytosis by diazoxide administration, with or without concurrent dexamethasone injections, was carried out to increase crinophagy of secretory granules. The human IAPP gene was also introduced into the ab and <b>ob</b> <b>mouse</b> models for diabetes. Finally, isolated islets cultivated in vitro at high glucose concentration were also examined. RESULTS: No amyloid deposits were found in the pancreata of any of the animals, either by light microscopy after Congo red staining or by electron microscopy after immunogold labeling with antibodies specific for human IAPP. Aurothioglucose treatment resulted in increased numbers of granules in the beta cell and the appearance of large lysosomal bodies without amyloid. However, islets from db and ob mice expressing human IAPP cultivated in vitro in the presence of glucocorticosteroid and/or growth hormone, were found to contain extracellular amyloid deposits reacting with antibodies to human IAPP. CONCLUSIONS: Oversecretion of human IAPP or increased crinophagy are not sufficient for amyloid formation. This indicates that other factors must influence amyloid deposition; one such factor may be the local clearance of IAPP...|$|E

40|$|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: In normal mouse islets, glucose induces {{synchronous}} cytoplasmic [Ca(2 +) ](i) oscillations in beta {{cells and}} pulses of insulin secretion. We investigated whether this fine regulation of islet function is preserved in hyperglycaemic and hyperinsulinaemic ob/ obmice. METHODS: Intact islets from ob/ <b>ob</b> <b>mice</b> and their lean littermates were used after overnight culture for measurement of [Ca(2 +) ](i) and insulin secretion. RESULTS: We observed {{three types of}} [Ca(2 +) ](i) responses during stimulation by 9 to 12 mmol/l of glucose: sustained increase, rapid oscillations and slow (or mixed) oscillations. They occurred in 8, 18 and 74 % of lean islets and 9, 0 and 91 % of ob/ ob islets, respectively. Subtle desynchronisation of [Ca(2 +) ](i) oscillations between regions occurred in 11 % of lean islets. In ob/ ob islets, desynchronisation was frequent (66 - 82 % depending on conditions) and prominent: oscillations were out of phase in different regions because of distinct periods and shapes. Only small ob/ ob islets were well synchronised, but sizes of synchronised lean and desynchronised ob/ ob islets were markedly overlapped. The occurrence of desynchronisation in clusters of 5 to 50 islet cells from ob/ obmice and not from lean mice further indicates that islet hypertrophy {{is not the only}} causal factor. In both types of islets, synchronous [Ca(2 +) ](i) oscillations were accompanied by oscillations of insulin secretion. In poorly synchronised ob/ ob islets, secretion was irregular but followed the pattern of the global [Ca(2 +) ](i) changes. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The regularity of glucose-induced [Ca(2 +) ](i) oscillations is disrupted in islets from ob/ <b>ob</b> <b>mice</b> and this desynchronisation perturbs the pulsatility of insulin secretion. A similar mechanism could contribute to the irregularity of insulin oscillations in Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{mechanisms by}} which L- 4 F reduces obesity and diabetes in obese (<b>ob)</b> diabetic <b>mice.</b> We hypothesized that L- 4 F reduces adiposity via increased pAMPK, pAKT, HO- 1, and increased insulin receptor phosphorylation in <b>ob</b> <b>mice.</b> Obese and lean mice were divided into five groups: lean, lean-L- 4 F-treated, ob, ob-L- 4 F-treated, and ob-L- 4 F-LY 294002. Food intake, insulin, glucose adipocyte stem cells, pAMPK, pAKT, CB 1, and insulin receptor phosphorylation were determined. Subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) were determined by MRI and hepatic lipid content by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. SAT and VAT volumes decreased in ob-L- 4 F-treated animals compared with control. L- 4 F treatment decreased hepatic lipid content and increased the numbers of small adipocytes (P < 0. 05) and phosphorylation of insulin receptors. L- 4 F decreased CB 1 in SAT and VAT and increased pAKT and pAMPK in endothelium. L- 4 F-mediated improvement in endothelium was prevented by LY 294002. Inhibition of pAKT and pAMPK by LY 294002 was associated {{with an increase in}} glucose levels. Upregulation of HO- 1 by L- 4 F produced adipose remodeling and increased the number of small differentiated adipocytes.

40|$|Background. Obesity {{is often}} {{associated}} with increased biliary cholesterol secretion resulting in cholesterol gallstone formation. We have previously demonstrated that leptin-deficient C 57 Bl/ 6 J Lep <b>ob</b> obese <b>mice</b> have abnormal biliary motility and are prone to cholesterol crystal formation. In addition, others have demonstrated that leptin-deficient mice when fed a lithogenic diet for eight weeks are not prone to gallstone formation. However, the biliary lipid and in vivo cholesterol crystal response of homozygous and heterozygous leptin-deficient mice to four weeks on a lithogenic diet has not been studied. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that lithogenic diets influence gallbladder bile composition, serum lipids and cholesterol crystal formation in homozygous and heterozygous leptin-deficient mice compared to normal lean controls. Methods. 319 female lean control mice, 280 heterozygous lep <b>ob</b> obese <b>mice</b> and 117 homozygous lep <b>ob</b> obese <b>mice</b> were studied. Mice were fed either a lithogenic or control non-lithogenic chow diet for four weeks. Gallbladder volumes were measured, and bile was pooled to calculate cholesterol saturation indices.

The lithogenic diet and mouse strain influenced body and liver weights, gallbladder volume, cholesterol crystal formation, serum cholesterol, glucose and leptin levels and hepatic fat vacuole numbers. However, only diet, not strain, altered biliary cholesterol saturation. Conclusion. The association among obesity, leptin, and gallstone formation may be primarily related to altered gallbladder motility and cholesterol crystal formation and only secondarily to biliary cholesterol saturation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Studies in rodents {{and some}} studies in humans {{have shown that}} {{conjugated}} linoleic acid (CLA), especially its trans - 10, cis - 12 isomer, reduces body fat content. However, some but not all studies in mice and humans (though none in rats) have found that CLA promotes insulin resistance. The molecular mechanisms responsible for these effects are unclear, and there are conflicting reports {{on the effects of}} CLA on peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) activation and expression. We have conducted three experiments with CLA in obese mice over three weeks, and one over eleven weeks. We have also investigated the effects of CLA isomers in PPARγ and PPARα reporter gene assays. Results Inclusion of CLA or CLA enriched with its trans - 10, cis - 12 isomer in the diet of female genetically obese (lep ob / lep <b>ob)</b> <b>mice</b> for up to eleven weeks reduced body weight gain and white fat pad weight. After two weeks, in contrast to beneficial effects obtained with the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone, CLA or CLA enriched with its trans - 10, cis - 12 isomer raised fasting blood glucose and plasma insulin concentrations, and exacerbated glucose tolerance. After 10 weeks, however, CLA had beneficial effects on glucose and insulin concentrations. At this time, CLA had no effect on the plasma TNFα concentration, but it markedly reduced the plasma adiponectin concentration. CLA and CLA enriched with either isomer raised the plasma triglyceride concentration during the first three weeks, but not subsequently. CLA enriched with its trans - 10, cis - 12 isomer, but not with its cis - 9, trans - 11 isomer, stimulated PPARγ-mediated reporter gene activity; both isomers stimulated PPARα-mediated reporter gene activity. Conclusions CLA initially decreased but subsequently increased insulin sensitivity in lep ob / lep <b>ob</b> <b>mice.</b> Activation of both PPARγ and PPARα may contribute to the improvement in insulin sensitivity. In the short term, however, another mechanism, activated primarily by trans - 10, cis - 12 -CLA, which probably leads to reduced adipocyte number and consequently reduced plasma adiponectin concentration, may decrease insulin sensitivity. </p...|$|R

In addition, leptin {{may serve as a}} mediator of the neuroendocrine response to star-vation, and may modulate the stress response and the tim-ing of puberty. A role for leptin in development is suggested by the presence of neuroendocrine and structural neuronal abnormalities in <b>ob</b> <b>ob</b> <b>mice</b> with genetic leptin deficiency. Here, we sought to determine the ontogeny of leptin expres-sion and its relationship to the developing neuroendocrine axis. Leptin increased 5 – 10 -fold in female mice during the second postnatal week independent of fat mass, and de-clined after weaning. The rise in leptin preceded the estab-lishment of adult levels of corticosterone, thyroxine, and es-tradiol. In contrast to adult mice, leptin was not acutely regulated by food deprivation during the early postnatal pe-riod. Circadian rhythms of leptin, corticosterone, and thy-roxine were regulated by food intake in adult mice. When ad libitum feeding was restricted to the light cycle, peak cor-ticosterone levels were shifted {{to the beginning of the}} light cycle and coincided with the nadir of leptin. The inverse re-lationship between leptin and corticosterone was main-tained such that a rise in leptin after feeding was associated with a decline in corticosterone. To determine whether changes in corticosterone during food restriction are medi-ated by leptin, we compared the patterns of corticosterone levels among o...|$|R
40|$|Background: Obesity, the {{condition}} of excessive accumulation of fat is a poorly understood disorder and is {{a risk factor for}} type II diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia. Recently, a putative mouse obese gene was cloned and its product, termed ob protein, was shown {{to be involved in the}} regulation of body weight. Materials and Methods: Bacterial and insect cells were used for expression of recombinant <b>mouse</b> <b>ob</b> protein. Amino-terminal sequence analysis and site-directed mutagenesis were used to identify and characterize the mature form of ob protein. Genetically obese mice and wild-type rats were used to determine the biological activity of <b>ob</b> protein. Results: <b>Mouse</b> <b>ob</b> protein is synthesized as a precursor molecule, the mature form of which was found in mouse serum. Biochemical analysis identified the processing site in the ob precursor molecule and an intramolecular disulfide bond in the mature form that is necessary for activity. Reduction of food intake and weight gain after administration of ob protein to genetically obese mice and wild-type rats is reversible. Discussion: This study demonstrates that ob protein is a secreted satiety factor which regulates body weight and reduces food intake even in animals with no genetic body weight abnormalities. The failure of ob protein to effect these parameters in db/db mice supports the hypothesis that these mice are deficient in a signaling molecule that normally responds to the ob protein...|$|R

The results confirm the existence of different T 3 receptors in different tissues. The results also suggest a heterogeneous receptor distribution within the preadipose cell line, with a predominance of c-erb Aα-type species.

However, the role of local, extrahypothalamic neuropeptide signaling in shaping synapse formation and neuronal plasticity in the brain is not well understood. Here, we characterize the spatiotemporal expression profile of the neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and its receptor CRHR 1 in the <b>mouse</b> <b>OB</b> throughout development. We found that CRH-expressing interneurons {{are present in the}} external plexiform layer, that its cognate receptor is expressed by granule cells, and show that both CRH and CRHR 1 expression enriches in the postnatal period when olfaction becomes important towards olfactory-related behaviors. Further, we provide electrophysiological evidence that CRHR 1 -expressing granule cells functionally respond to CRH ligand, and that the physiological circuitry of CRHR 1 knockout mice is abnormal, leading to impaired olfactory behaviors. Together, these data suggest a physiologically relevant role for local CRH signaling towards shaping the neuronal circuitry within the <b>mouse</b> <b>OB...</b>|$|R
40|$|Combination {{therapy is}} being {{increasingly}} {{used as a}} treatment paradigm for metabolic diseases such as diabetes and obesity. In the peptide therapeutics realm, recent work has highlighted the therapeutic potential of chimeric peptides that act on two distinct receptors, thereby harnessing parallel complementary mechanisms to induce additive or synergistic benefit compared to monotherapy. Here, we extend this hypothesis by linking a known anti-diabetic peptide with an anti-obesity peptide into a novel peptide hybrid, which we termed a phybrid. We report on the synthesis and biological activity of two such phybrids (AC 164204 and AC 164209), comprised of a glucagon-like peptide- 1 receptor (GLP 1 -R) agonist, and exenatide analog, AC 3082, covalently linked to a second generation amylin analog, davalintide. Both molecules acted as full agonists at their cognate receptors in vitro, albeit with reduced potency at the calcitonin receptor indicating slightly perturbed amylin agonism. In obese diabetic Lep(ob) /Lep (<b>ob)</b> <b>mice</b> sustained infusion of AC 164204 and AC 164209 reduced glucose and glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1 c) equivalently but induced greater weight loss relative to exenatide administration alone. Weight loss {{was similar to that}} induced by combined administration of exenatide and davalintide. In diet-induced obese rats, both phybrids dose-dependently reduced food intake and body weight {{to a greater extent than}} exenatide or davalintide alone, and equal to co-infusion of exenatide and davalintide. Phybrid-mediated and exenatide + davalintide-mediated weight loss was associated with reduced adiposity and preservation of lean mass. These data are the first to provide in vivo proof-of-concept for multi-pathway targeting in metabolic disease via a peptide hybrid, demonstrating that this approach is as effective as co-administration of individual peptides...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} thyroid hormone (TH) on {{metabolism}} and energy expenditure is well established, but {{the role of}} TH in regulating nutritional sensing particularly in the CNS is only poorly defined. The consequences of hypothyroidism on leptin production as well as leptin sensing were analyzed in TRH receptor 1 (Trhr 1) knockout mice that exhibit congenital hypothyroidism due to a diminished TRH stimulation of pituitary thyrotrophs. The hypothyroid mice exhibited a 50 % reduction in white adipose tissue compared to euthyroid controls. Moreover, the animals showed a decrease in leptin transcript levels as well as strongly reduced leptin serum levels. The finding that murine 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes responded to T 3 with a rise in leptin transcript levels suggests that TH indeed may regulate leptin expression in a cell-autonomous manner. The transcript levels of leptin receptor were altered under hypothyroid conditions as well. The hypothyroid Trhr 1 ko mice showed an increase in LepR mRNA expression specifically in neurons of the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, an important target of leptin action. Likewise, the transcript levels of SOCS 3, a potent negative regulator of LepR signaling, were strongly decreased in these neurons. In order to eliminate any effects of the different circulating leptin levels in the analysis, hypothyroid and leptin-deficient animals were generated by crossing hypothyroid Trhr 1 ko mice with the leptin-deficient <b>ob</b> <b>mice</b> and their response to leptin substitution was analyzed. In comparison to euthyroid ob animals, hypothyroid Trhr 1 /ob dko mice showed decreased body weight and appetite loss following three days of leptin treatment. Moreover, phospho-Stat 3 immunoreactivity in the arcuate nucleus was strongly reduced in Trhr 1 /ob dko mice compared to euthyroid controls. These data indicate alterations in the intracellular processing of the leptin signal under hypothyroid conditions and thereby unravel a novel mode of action by which TH affects energy metabolism...|$|R

40|$|Glucose-dependent insulinotropic {{polypeptide}} (GIP) is {{an important}} incretin hormone, which potentiates glucose-induced insulin secretion. Antihyperglycaemic actions of GIP provide significant potential in Type II diabetes therapy. However, inactivation of GIP by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) and its consequent short circulating half-life limit its therapeutic use. Therefore two novel Tyr(1) -modified analogues of GIP, N-Fmoc-GIP (where Fmoc is 9 -fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl) and N-palmitate-GIP, were synthesized and tested for metabolic stability and biological activity. Both GIP analogues were resistant to degradation by DPP IV and human plasma. In Chinese hamster lung (CHL) cells expressing the cloned human GIP receptor, both analogues exhibited a 2 -fold increase in cAMP-generating potency compared with native GIP (EC(50) values of 9. 4, 10. 0 and 18. 2 nM respectively). Using clonal BRIN-BD 11 cells, both analogues demonstrated strong insulinotropic activity compared with native GIP (P < 0. 01 to P < 0. 001). In obese diabetic (<b>ob</b> / <b>ob)</b> <b>mice,</b> administration of N-Fmoc-GIP or N-palmitate-GIP (25 nmol/kg) together with glucose (18 mmol/kg) significantly reduced the peak 15 min glucose excursion (1. 4 - and 1. 5 -fold respectively; P < 0. 05 to P < 0. 01) compared with glucose alone. The area under the curve (AUC) for glucose was significantly lower after administration of either analogue compared with glucose administered alone or in combination with native GIP (1. 5 -fold; P < 0. 05). This {{was associated with a}} significantly greater AUC for insulin (2. 1 -fold; P < 0. 001) for both analogues compared with native GIP. A similar pattern of in vivo responsiveness was evident in lean control mice. These data indicate that novel N-terminal Tyr(1) modification of GIP with an Fmoc or palmitate group confers resistance to degradation by DPP IV in plasma, which is reflected by increased in vitro potency and greater insulinotropic and antihyperglycaemic activities in an animal model of Type II diabetes mellitus...|$|R
40|$|Ghrelin (Ghr) is an orexigenic peptide that {{is being}} {{investigated}} for its potential role in development of anxietylike behavior and modulation of depressive-like symptoms induced by bilateral olfactory bulbectomy (OB) in rodents. Olfactory bulbectomy is an animal model useful to study of depression and Ghr could be an alternative therapeutic tool in depression therapy. We studied the effects of intracerebroventricular (i. c. v.) Ghr administration on the expression of hypothalamic genes related to depression and mood (delta opioid receptor (DOR), mu opioid receptor (MOR) and kappa opioid receptor (KOR), lutropin-choriogonadotropic hormone receptor (LHCGR), serotonin transporter (SERT), interleukin 1 beta (IL- 1 b), vasopressin (AVP) and corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH)) in OB animals, as well as changes in plasma levels of AVP, CRH and adenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). We found that acute Ghr 0. 3 nmol/μl administration increases gene expression of DOR, SERT and LHCGR in <b>OB</b> <b>mice</b> and decreased expression of IL- 1 b, suggesting that these genes could {{be involved in the}} antidepressant-like effects of Ghr. In addition, OB animals exhibit high AVP gene expression and elevated plasma concentrations of AVP and ACTH and acute Ghr 0. 3 nmol/μl administration reduces AVP gene expression and the concentration of these hormones, suggesting that peptide-effects on depressive-like behavior could be mediated at least in part via AVP. In conclusion, this study provides new evidence about genes, receptors and hormones involved in the antidepressant mechanism/s induced by Ghr in OB animals. Fil: Poretti, María Belén.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about how normal aging affects the brain. Recent {{evidence}} suggests that neuronal loss is not ubiquitous in aging neocortex. Instead, subtle and still controversial, region- and layer-specific alterations of neuron morphology and synapses are reported during aging, leading {{to the notion that}} discrete changes in neural circuitry may underlie age-related cognitive deficits. Although deficits in sensory function suggest that primary sensory cortices are affected by aging, our understanding of the age-related cellular and molecular changes is sparse. To assess the effect of aging on the organization of olfactory bulb (OB) circuitry, we carried out quantitative morphometric analyses in the <b>mouse</b> <b>OB</b> at 2, 6, 12, 18, and 24 mo. Our data establish that the volumes of the major OB layers do not change during aging. Parallel to this, we are unique in demonstrating that the stereotypic glomerular convergence of M 72 -GFP OSN axons in the OB is preserved during aging. We then provide unique evidence of the stability of projection neurons and interneurons subpopulations in the aging <b>mouse</b> <b>OB,</b> arguing against the notion of an age-dependent widespread loss of neurons. Finally, we show ultrastructurally a significant layer-specific loss of synapses; synaptic density is reduced in the glomerular layer but not the external plexiform layer, leading to an imbalance in OB circuitry. These results suggest that reduction of afferent synaptic input and local modulatory circuit synapses in OB glomeruli may contribute to specific age-related alterations of the olfactory function...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} study {{performed}} in MANUSCRIPT I is to elucidate {{the effect of}} fasting pathways on Nrf 2 -Keap 1 /ARE pathway. Few studies exist regarding how fasting affects transporter or the nuclear receptor-regulated pathways which regulation expression. Fasting effects on the Nrf 2 -Keap 1 signaling pathway, which is responsive to oxidative stress and altered redox status have not been elucidated. The observations presented in this study prove that 1) fasting increases Abcc expression through Nrf 2 - and Sirt 1 -dependent mechanisms, 2) cAMP/PKA activators increase ARE activation via Nrf 2 - and Sirt 1 -dependent mechanisms in vitro, 3) Nrf 2 expression is co-ordinately regulated with Pgc- 12 ̆ 6 agr; and Sirt 1 expression and 4) obesity/steatosis diminishes fasting-mediated Abcc induction. ^ The purpose of study performed in MANUSCRIPT II hypothesized that CR would reverse the NR and drug transporter expression changes previously observed in obesity-induced hepatic steatosis. Given the well-defined association of Nrf 2 with Abcc transporter induction, {{emphasis was placed on}} the Nrf 2 pathway, but other NRs that have been described to regulate transporter expression were also evaluated. Our data herein illustrate that CR differentially regulates NR, biotransformation enzyme, and transporter expression in livers from C 57 Bl/ 6 (WT) and Lepob/ob (<b>OB)</b> <b>mice.</b> Furthermore, AMPK and Sirt 1 activators differentially modulated transporter and NR expression in lean and steatotic hepatocytes. ^ In MANUSCRIPT III we demonstrate differential susceptibility of a mouse model, constitutively overexpressing Nrf 2 (Keap 1 -KD mice) to CR. We attribute these changes to novel changes in the miRNA regulatory circuit. We demonstrate that the enhanced susceptibility to CR in Nrf 2 overexpressing mice could be partly associated with differential changes in miRNA expression such as miR 34 a, miR 370, miR 122 and miR 144, especially those known to be involved in regulation of lipogenic as well as fatty acid oxidation genes. ^ In summary, the studies presented herein demonstrate Nrf 2 -ARE pathway is a nutrient sensitive pathway that is: (a) activated upon fasting via Sirt 1 -Pgc- 12 ̆ 6 agr; dependent mechanisms, (b) negatively regulated upon CR and AMPK pathway, (c) plays a role in development of obesity, and (d) regulates expression of miRNA regulatory circuit thereby changing susceptibility to weight loss and fatty acid metabolism, (e) is a potential target to alleviate metabolic syndrome.

Aim of the studyTo evaluate the ability of Rosmarinus ofﬁcinalis hydroalcoholic extract (ROHE), as compared to the positive control fluoxetine, to reverse behavioral (hyperactivity, anhedonic behavior and learning deficit in water maze) and biochemical alterations (serum glucose level and acetylcholinesterase, AChE, activity) induced by an animal model of depression, the olfactory bulbectomy (<b>OB)</b> in <b>mice.</b> Materials and methodsLocomotor and exploratory behavior was assessed in the open-field, novel object and novel cage tests, anhedonic behavior was assessed in the splash test; cognitive deficits were evaluated in the water maze task. For the first set of experiments, ROHE (10 – 300 mg/kg) or fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) was administered once daily (p. o.) for 14 days after OB and the behavioral tests were performed. For the second set of experiments, serum glucose and hippocampal and cerebrocortical AChE activity were determined in <b>OB</b> and SHAM-operated <b>mice</b> treated orally with ROHE (10 mg/kg), fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) or vehicle. ResultsROHE (10 – 300 mg/kg), similar to fluoxetine, reversed OB-induced hyperactivity, increased exploratory and anhedonic behavior. OB needed significantly more trials in the training session to acquire the spatial information, but they displayed a similar profile to that of SHAM mice in the test session (24 h later), demonstrating a selective deficit in spatial learning, which was not reversed by ROHE or fluoxetine. A reduced serum glucose level and an increased hippocampal AChE activity were observed in bulbectomized mice; only the latter effect was reversed by fluoxetine, while both effects were reversed by ROHE. ConclusionsROHE exerted an antidepressant-like effect in bulbectomized mice and was able to abolish AchE alterations and hypoglycemia, but not spatial learning deficit induced by OB. Overall, results suggest the potential of Rosmarinus officinalis {{for the treatment of}} depression, validating the traditional use of this plant...|$|R

Leptin, the most famous of the satiety hormones, is a hormone produced by white adipose tissue. Leptin was identified by positional cloning of the spontaneous <b>mouse</b> <b>ob</b> mutation (Zhang et al. 1994), leading to the identification of a small serum protein that regulates energy expenditure and food intake (Halaas et al. 1995).

Expression of leptin receptor in neurons of the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus improves insulin sensitivity (Morton et al. 2005).|$|R
