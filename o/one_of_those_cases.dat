5|$|Another related {{investigation}} {{involved the}} fate of the children of captured pregnant guerrillas, who were given up for adoption by the military junta. An estimated 500 children were involved. The investigation became controversial during the Kirchner administration, as those involved had become adults and some of them refused to participate in DNA testing. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>cases</b> was the Noble siblings case, involving the adopted sons of Ernestina Herrera de Noble, owner of the Clarín newspaper. The Kirchners advanced a bill in Congress to make the genetic testing of suspected victims mandatory. Although the measure had popular support, critics considered it a breach of the right to privacy, and politically motivated because of a dispute between Kirchner and the Clarín newspaper. The Noble siblings tests in 2011 were negative, and the case was closed in January 2016, after Kirchner left the presidency. Hilario Bacca, a confirmed son of disappeared guerrillas, appealed a judicial ruling that sought to change his name, asking to keep the name he had been using.|$|E

However, he had a problem with the scene in which one of the Syndicate members changes into an alien rebel, reasoning that this was because the effect had been created on such short notice. He explained, [...] "It was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>cases</b> where you just run out of time, sorry to say". He later expressed a desire to one day go back and amend the effect.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{describes}} a dynamic {{variant of the}} traditional ABC storage policy. The variant {{is to be used}} in manual order picking warehouses where SKUs experience a rather unstable demand. Its objective is to reduce the order picking time. It mainly consists in shifting items between the storage areas A, B and C according to the way their daily number of order lines changes. A few case studies based on computer simulations have shown that this variant can yield interesting time savings if its parameters are chosen with care. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>case</b> studies is presented in this paper. Because of the pioneering nature of this variant, some ideas for further research are also sketched...|$|R
500|$|According to neo-Darwinism, adaptations are {{produced}} incrementally through natural selection, so major genetic changes will usually spread within populations {{only if they}} do not decrease the fitness of individuals. Although neutral changes (ones which provide no benefit) can spread through genetic drift, and detrimental changes can spread under some circumstances, large changes that require multiple steps will occur only if the intermediate stages increase fitness. Richard Dawkins describes the matter: [...] "The wheel may be <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>cases</b> where the engineering solution can be seen in plain view, yet be unattainable in evolution because it lies [...] {{the other side of a}} deep valley, cutting unbridgeably across the massif of Mount Improbable." [...] In such a fitness landscape, wheels might sit on a highly favorable [...] "peak", but the valley around that peak may be too deep or wide for the gene pool to migrate across by genetic drift or natural selection. Stephen Jay Gould notes that biological adaptation is limited to working with available components, commenting that [...] "wheels work well, but animals are debarred from building them by structural constraints inherited as an evolutionary legacy".|$|E

[...] The Hollywood Reporter's critic Todd McCarthy said: [...] "It would have helped if director Nick Cassavetes had something resembling a sure hand at comedy." [...] Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club gave the film grade C-, saying [...] "All of a sudden, a spotted Great Dane squats {{in the middle of}} a Manhattan apartment and out plop several gleaming, glistening CGI turds.

[...] Michael Phillips of Chicago Tribune gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Line to line, it's fresher than any number of guy-centric [...] "Hangover"-spawned affairs, despite director Cassavetes' lack of flair for slapstick." [...] The Boston Globe's Ty Burr gave the film one out of four stars and said, [...] "It's [...] "The First Wives Club" [...] rewritten for younger, less demanding audiences, or a [...] "9 to 5" [...] with absolutely nothing at stake."

2500|$|In {{the vast}} {{majority}} of cases, anyway, the Rorschach test wasn't singled out but used as one of several in a battery of tests, and despite the criticism of usage of the Rorschach in the courts, out of 8,000 cases in which forensic psychologists used Rorschach-based testimony, the appropriateness of the instrument was challenged only six times, and the testimony was ruled inadmissible in only <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>cases.</b> One study has found that use of the test in courts has increased by three times in the decade between 1996 and 2005, compared to the previous fifty years.

2500|$|Coffin found {{guidance}} in resolving this problem first from an opinion he'd written {{in another case}} two years earlier which led him to exclude from Convention coverage those arbitration clauses found defective though fraud, mistake, duress, and waiver. This was not <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>cases.</b> [...] "The precise question we ask," [...] he wrote, [...] "is whether a matter that has been barred by unanimous judicial precedent for {{a decade and a}} half from resolution by arbitration, because of a multiplicity of solid reasons that lose no pertinence or weight in an international context, is a matter 'capable of settlement by arbitration'". He found this very broad, as any dispute could theoretically be solved that way.|$|E
2500|$|Goddard did {{not believe}} {{arbitration}} offered the same protections as the 1933 Act. While the Second Circuit, which had appellate jurisdiction over the Southern District, had been supportive of arbitration between companies in the past, it had also recognized its limitations. However, this was not <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>cases.</b> [...] "Congress in its concern for the investor's protection and the restoration of {{public confidence in the}} industry, must have been aware of the lesser bargaining position of the purchaser of securities," [...] he wrote. [...] "By ... barring waiver of rights it plainly meant to prevent an advantage gained from an assertion of a superior bargaining power." [...] The defendants had pointed to arbitration allowed under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and the Miller Act, but he distinguished those cases from the one before him by noting that the FLSA did not have the same anti-waiver provisions, nor had they concerned themselves with statutory conflicts.|$|E
