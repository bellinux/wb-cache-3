2500|$|A {{floating}} caliper (also called a [...] "sliding caliper") moves {{with respect to}} the disc, along a line parallel to the axis of rotation of the disc; a piston {{on one side of the}} disc pushes the inner brake pad until it makes contact with the braking surface, then pulls the caliper body with the <b>outer</b> <b>brake</b> pad so pressure is applied to both sides of the disc. Floating caliper (single piston) designs are subject to sticking failure, caused by dirt or corrosion entering at least one mounting mechanism and stopping its normal movement. This can lead to the caliper's pads rubbing on the disc when the brake is not engaged or engaging it at an angle. Sticking can result from infrequent vehicle use, failure of a seal or rubber protection boot allowing debris entry, dry-out of the grease in the mounting mechanism and subsequent moisture incursion leading to corrosion, or some combination of these factors. Consequences may include reduced fuel efficiency, extreme heating of the disc or excessive wear on the affected pad. A sticking front caliper may also cause steering vibration.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{majority}} of magnetic chemically peculiar (mCP) stars exhibit periodic light, magnetic, radio, and spectroscopic variations {{that can be}} modelled adequately as a rigidly-rotating main-sequence star with persistent surface structures. Nevertheless, {{there is a small}} sample of diverse mCP stars whose rotation periods vary on timescales of decades while the shapes of their phase curves remain unchanged. Alternating period increases and decreases have been suspected in the hot CP stars CU Vir and V 901 Ori, while rotation in the moderately cool star BS Cir has been decelerating. These examples bring new insight into this theoretically unpredicted phenomenon. We discuss possible causes of such behaviour, and propose that dynamic interactions between a thin, <b>outer,</b> magnetically-confined envelope <b>braked</b> by the stellar wind, and an inner faster-rotating stellar body, are able to explain the observed rotational variability. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Flow {{misalignment}} {{was identified}} in the conventional ventilated disk brake design. The conventional ventilated disk brake has straight bi-directional blade design. The misalignment was quantified using CFD as design tool. In the effort of re-aligning the flow angle helical lines fitted onto the conventional inner and <b>outer</b> diameter disk <b>brakes</b> yielded two different design innovation. The two “curved ” designs have highlighted tremendous improvement on flow characteristics. Experimental analysis is carried out on the two curved 1 and curved 2 prototypes. The quantitative mass flow rate result is compared for conventional and the two curve shaped brake disk. Then, the data is fed as input condition to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model for disk brake models to analysis the flow characteristics qualitatively. The aerodynamics visualization through CFD supports well the mass flow improvement. The non-dimensional flow number is established and the correlation between flow number and Reynolds number is highlighted...|$|R
50|$|The {{spiral dive}} {{is the most}} rapid form of {{controlled}} fast descent; an aggressive spiral dive can achieve a sink rate of 25 m/s. This maneuver halts forward progress and brings the flier almost straight down. The pilot pulls the brakes {{on one side and}} shifts his weight onto that side to induce a sharp turn. The flight path then begins to resembles a corkscrew. After a specific downward speed is reached, the wing points directly to the ground. When the pilot reaches his desired height, he ends this maneuver by slowly releasing the inner brake, shifting his weight to the <b>outer</b> side and <b>braking</b> on this side. The release of the inner brake has to be handled carefully to end the spiral dive gently in a few turns. If done too fast, the wing translates the turning into a dangerous upward and pendular motion.|$|R

40|$|We {{report on}} the fourth phase of our study of {{slightly}} rotating accretion flows onto black holes. The main new element {{of this study is}} that we used fully three dimensional (3 -D) numerical simulations. We consider hydrodynamics of inviscid accretion flows. We assume a spherically symmetric density distribution at the <b>outer</b> boundary, but <b>brake</b> the flow symmetry by introducing a small, latitude-dependent angular momentum. We also consider cases where angular momentum at large radii is latitude- and azimuth-dependent. For the latitude-dependent angular momentum, 3 -D simulations confirm axisymmetric results: the material that has too much angular momentum to be accreted forms a thick torus near the equator. Consequently, accretion proceeds only through the polar funnel, and the mass accretion rate through the funnel is constrained by the size and shape of the torus, not by the outer conditions. In 3 -D simulations, we found that the torus precesses, even for axisymmetric conditions at large radii. For the latitude and azimuth-dependent angular momentum, the non-rotating gas near the equator can also significantly affect the evolution of the rotating gas. In particular, it may prevent the formation of a proper torus (i. e. its closing, in the azimuthal direction). In such models, the mass accretion rate is only slightly less than the corresponding Bondi rate.

40|$|Context. The {{majority}} of magnetic chemically peculiar (mCP) stars exhibit periodic light, radio, spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric variations {{that can be}} adequately explained by the model of a rigidly rotating main-sequence star with persistent surface structures. CU Vir and V 901 Ori belong among these few mCP stars whose rotation periods vary on timescales of decades. Aims. We aim to study {{the stability of the}} periods in CU Vir and V 901 Ori using all accessible observational data containing phase information. Methods. We collected all available relevant archived observations supplemented with our new measurements of these stars and analysed the period variations of the stars using a novel method that allows for the combination of data of diverse sorts. Results. We found that the shapes of their phase curves were constant during the last several decades, while the periods were changing. At the same time, both stars exhibit alternating intervals of rotational braking and acceleration. The rotation period of CU Vir was gradually shortening until the year 1968, when it reached its local minimum of 0. 52067198 d. The period then started increasing, reaching its local maximum of 0. 5207163 d in the year 2005. Since that time the rotation has begun to accelerate again. We also found much smaller period changes in CU Vir on a timescale of several years. The rotation period of V 901 Ori was increasing for the past quarter-century, reaching a maximum of 1. 538771 d in the year 2003, when the rotation period began to decrease. Conclusions. We propose that dynamical interactions between a thin, <b>outer</b> magnetically-confined envelope, <b>braked</b> by the stellar wind, with an inner, faster rotating stellar body is able to explain the observed rotational variability. A theoretically unexpected alternating variability of rotation periods in these stars would remove the spin-down time paradox and brings a new insight into structure and evolution of magnetic upper-main-sequence stars.
