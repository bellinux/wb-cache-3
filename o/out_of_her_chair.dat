50|$|The {{music video}} begins with Martin in a fat suit toddling {{along to the}} metro bus and, {{realising}} he could never fit through the door, hitches a ride {{at the rear of}} the bus on a skateboard to his destination, which is a Los Angeles theatre where there's a ballet rehearsing. Later, an aspirant ballerina, played by Lucas, also stuck in a fat suit hops along to an audition where a line of slender dancers give her sidelong glances.She hands over her portfolio to the people holding the audition and, because <b>of</b> <b>her</b> appearance, is immediately rejected. Hurt, she instead heads to the Venice Beach boardwalk in Los Angeles where, in spite <b>of</b> <b>her</b> large size, dances to her heart's content. Meanwhile, Martin's rotund character gets a menial job as janitor and is tossing trash into the dumpster before his 'boss' comes out in the alley and kicks him back to work. The ballerina's home is a trailer and she plops down into a chair to rest and daydream. Meanwhile, back at the theatre, the ballet dancers are rehearsing and Chris steps into the background with his bucket until the director shouts, 'Excuse me!'. A postal worker brings the girl an invite from the theatre, while Chris is shown watering the plants and dancing in his own makeshift stage that he's created outside on the roof of the landmark building. The marquee blazes 'Big Ballet Premiere' as the big girl tries to find a seat in the audience. Later, tears come to her eyes while watching the partners twirl on stage, but when the show is over she finds she can't get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> little <b>chair.</b> Then, Chris waltzes onto the stage with his partner, and the girl is compelled to join him in a dance making theirs a perfect match.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{door was}} open, and I {{took off my}} hat and walked in. It wasn't very light; inside, but there she sat in a rocking-chair by the window smoking a black cheroot. And when I got closer I {{saw that she was}} about thirty-nine, and had never seen a {{straight}} front in her life. I sat down on the arm <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair,</b> and took the cheroot <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mouth and stole a kiss.|$|R
60|$|That name {{brought a}} cry <b>out</b> <b>of</b> my head, Dolly seizing the arm <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Presty bounced <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair.</b> [...] "You--have seen--Sydney Westerfield?" [...] she {{repeated}} with emphatic pauses which expressed amazement tempered by unbelief.|$|E
60|$|He goes out. The {{telephone}} rings. The Princess starts <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair,</b> terrified, and recoils as far {{as possible}} from the instrument.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} Lottie was up <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair</b> and beyond repartee in her flight down the gangway stairs. She left the two youngsters confronted.|$|E
60|$|Anna drummed impatiently {{with her}} fingers against the arm <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|R
60|$|She thrilled all over, and convulsively {{grasped the}} arm <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|R
60|$|He saw her whiten. He saw {{her fingers}} clutch the sides <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't want to," [...] said Ellen, and {{she dragged}} herself up <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair,</b> and trailed slowly {{out of the}} room without looking at her mother.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Gray got <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair</b> {{as soon as}} the men put it down, {{and went}} to Rosie's chair to ask Rosie how she had got along.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh laws!" [...] exclaimed Miss Biggs, {{jumping up}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair</b> {{with her hands}} and fingers outstretched, as though never, never in her life before, had her ears been wounded by such wicked words as those.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are <b>out</b> <b>of</b> spirits, love," [...] {{she said}} at last, {{breaking}} the long silence, as Lillian gave an unconscious sigh and leaned wearily into the depths <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|R
60|$|The doctor came behind her, and put {{his hand}} on the back <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|R
60|$|She tossed {{over the}} back <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair</b> an {{envelope}} to Thatcher. He opened it.|$|R
60|$|Mr. George {{said this}} in a very quiet manner, and then {{proceeded}} to help Rosie <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair.</b> The guide who had come up the mountain with them then led the way, and Mr. George, Rollo, Rosie and Josie followed, towards the crater.|$|E
6000|$|For {{the fourth}} time I began, and for {{the fourth time}} the old lady started <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair.</b> [...] "Now I must repose myself," [...] said mademoiselle, walking lightly from end to end of the room, and humming a French air, by way of taking a rest.|$|E
6000|$|The next day, their Papa {{had taken}} them into the country to see Lady Seabury, Bessie's godmother, a very old lady indeed, older than Grandmamma, and who could not move <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair.</b> [...] "She gave me--" [...] wrote Bessie. There again {{something}} had been scratched out, and [...] "a kiss" [...] written overhead.|$|E
60|$|He {{sat on the}} arm <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair,</b> and {{she stroked}} his head with her hands.|$|R
60|$|Sydney Barnes {{leaned over}} the back <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair.</b> His hot whisper seemed to burn her cheek.|$|R
60|$|Miss Ophelia {{rose from}} this {{encouraging}} colloquy; St. Clare was {{leaning over the}} back <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Very soon he did {{return and}} sat down again. [...] "A pint and a screw, that's all I want," [...] he said, as if {{speaking}} to himself, {{and there was no}} answer. Then he got up, {{put his hand on her}} shoulder, and almost shook her <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair.</b> [...] "Don't you hear?" [...] he shouted.|$|E
6000|$|Having been thus answered, he {{was quiet}} for a long time. She had slipped again <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair</b> to kneel beside him; it seemed the only place from which she could find courage for her answers. He put his hand, that had lost its brown, on her hair. At that she plucked up spirit to ask: ...|$|E
6000|$|Like prophecy! I {{knew it was}} prophecy; and I {{sat down}} crying, as knowing we should lose her.

60|$|He {{came over}} and sat upon the arm <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair.</b> She was very sweet, very dainty, very pretty.|$|R
60|$|Sally {{kicked the}} leg <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair</b> irritably. She read insolent disapproval into the words. He was daring to criticize...|$|R
60|$|After which strong avowal Bella {{underwent}} reaction, {{and cried}} to any extent, {{with her face}} on the back <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|R
6000|$|One half an {{hour and}} then another elapsed, and Tom did not return. Mr. Shaw went out, Mrs. Shaw retired to her room escorted by Maud, and the two girls sat {{together}} wondering if anything dreadful had happened. All of a sudden a voice called, [...] "Polly!" [...] and that young lady started <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair,</b> as if the sound had been a thunder-clap.|$|E
6000|$|... * A near {{relation}} of the author's used to tell of having been stopped by the rioters, and escorted home in the manner described. On reaching her own home one of her attendants, in the appearance a baxter, a baker's lad, handed her <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair,</b> and took leave with a bow, which, in the lady's opinion, argued breeding that could hardly be learned at the oven's mouth.|$|E
6000|$|He {{shrugged his}} shoulders, {{and threw it}} into her lap, trying to look cool and careless, but failing entirely, for he was ashamed of himself, and out of sorts generally. Rose wanted to cry, but pride would not let her, and, being very angry, she {{relieved}} herself by talk instead of tears. Looking pale and excited, she rose <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair,</b> cast away the ring, {{and said in a}} voice that she vainly tried to keep steady, ...|$|E
60|$|From {{the depths}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair,</b> Rachael {{for several moments}} sat and {{subjected}} her visitor to a close and merciless scrutiny.|$|R
6000|$|And {{here the}} old lady stopped, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> breath, with <b>her</b> cap askew, her {{spectacles}} on the end <b>of</b> <b>her</b> nose, and her knitting much the worse for being waved enthusiastically in the air, while she hung over the arm <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair,</b> shrilly cheering an imaginary Lafayette. The girls clapped their hands, and Tom hurrahed with all his might, saying, when he got his breath, [...] "Lafayette was a regular old trump; I always liked him." ...|$|R
60|$|She laughed to herself--a low, terrible laugh, which startled {{even the}} doctor into taking his hand {{off the back}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|R
