The song premiered online on 14 October 2010, via Robyn's SoundCloud account. The single was initially planned to be released on 17 November 2010 in Sweden, but it was changed to 1 November 2010.

5|$|Body Talk Pt. 2 is {{the sixth}} studio album by Swedish {{recording}} artist Robyn. It {{was released on}} 6 September 2010, by Konichiwa Records. The album is {{the second part of}} the Body Talk trilogy, which consists of three mini-albums, all released during 2010. Robyn started working on songs for the album when Body Talk Pt. 1 (2010) was still in development, and she collaborated with Klas Åhlund, Kleerup, Savage Skulls, Diplo, Snoop Dogg and Niggaracci. Musically, the songs <b>on</b> <b>Body</b> Talk Pt. 2 are upbeat and a mixture between electro, house, hip hop and disco.|$|E

40|$|When {{performing}} model-scale {{resistance tests}} <b>on</b> <b>bodies</b> towed in water it is normal practice to deliberately stimulate turbulence {{close to the}} leading edge to permit appropriate scaling of resistance measurements. Alternatively, tests <b>on</b> towed <b>bodies</b> can address the flow characteristics over {{the body in the}} absence of deliberately tripped turbulent flow. In the second case an appreciation of the extent of laminar and turbulent flow over the body is of particular interest. While sophisticated and expensive methods are available to experimentally detect the location of transition <b>on</b> <b>bodies</b> in fluid flow, these are still particularly challenging when applied <b>on</b> <b>bodies</b> being towed through water. In this paper a straightforward alternative experimental method to detect transition <b>on</b> towed <b>bodies</b> is provided. This transition detection method simply uses conventional experimental measurements of drag <b>on</b> a towed <b>body,</b> subject to deliberate turbulence stimulation, to deduce the extent of laminar flow. The transition detection method is theoretically outlined and an experimental flow visualisation procedure demonstrates the required effectiveness of the turbulence stimulators used. An experimental demonstration of the proposed method is provided using two alternative turbulence stimulation devices. The conclusions indicate that the proposed method provides a practical and robust method to experimentally detect transition <b>on</b> a towed <b>body</b> with reasonable accuracy...|$|R
