40|$|This study {{discusses}} {{the question of}} whether defense lawyers should be prohibited from taking pictures while they interview the accused <b>or</b> <b>suspects</b> in custody. The study concludes that they should not be prohibited from taking such pictures. Article 34 and 37 （ 3 ）of the Constitution of Japan guarantee the right of the accused <b>or</b> <b>suspects</b> in custody to have lawyer assistance. Article 39 （ 1 ）of the Law of Criminal Procedure states that they may, without an official present, have an interview with, or send to/receive documents or articles from counsel or prospective counsel upon the request of a person entitled to appoint counsel. The Decision of the Supreme Court admitted that the right of the accused person <b>or</b> <b>suspects</b> in custody to interview freely and confidentially with a defense lawyer was essential to their having effective lawyer assistance. In practice, the rules of the institution detaining the accused <b>or</b> <b>suspects</b> prohibit defense lawyers from taking pictures while interviewing them. They insist that it would cause the risk of concealing/destroying evidence or the fleeing of the accused <b>or</b> <b>suspects</b> <b>or</b> impose a danger to the discipline and the order of the institutions if they permit lawyers to take pictures during the interview with them. There have been several cases in which the staff of the institution intervened and stopped the interview by reason that they found that the defense lawyer had taken the pictures of the accused in custody. The defense lawyers respectively brought lawsuits requesting state compensation. They argued that the prohibition of taking pictures and stopping the interview infringes the right of the accused person <b>or</b> <b>suspects</b> in custody and the defense lawyers to interview freely and confidentially with each other. Decisions of the lower courts held that the rights were not infringed. This study examines the issues concerning this question. The study concludes that the defense lawyers should not be prohibited from taking pictures during the interviews with the accused <b>or</b> <b>suspects</b> in custody because taking pictures is a necessary and appropriate measure for the accused <b>or</b> <b>suspects</b> to have and the lawyers to afford effective assistance...|$|R

5|$|Antibiotics are {{not usually}} used for gastroenteritis, {{although}} they are sometimes recommended if symptoms are particularly severe or if a susceptible bacterial cause is isolated <b>or</b> <b>suspected.</b> If antibiotics are to be employed, a macrolide (such as azithromycin) is preferred over a fluoroquinolone due to higher rates {{of resistance to the}} latter. Pseudomembranous colitis, usually caused by antibiotic use, is managed by discontinuing the causative agent and treating it with either metronidazole or vancomycin. Bacteria and protozoans that are amenable to treatment include Shigella Salmonella typhi, and Giardia species. In those with Giardia species or Entamoeba histolytica, tinidazole treatment is recommended and superior to metronidazole. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of antibiotics in young children who have both bloody diarrhea and fever.|$|E
5|$|In 1938 Vaughan Williams met Ursula Wood (1911–2007), {{the wife}} of an army officer, Captain (later Lieutenant-Colonel) Michael Forrester Wood. She was a poet, and had {{approached}} the composer with a proposed scenario for a ballet. Despite their both being married, and a four-decade age-gap, {{they fell in love}} almost from their first meeting; they maintained a secret love affair for more than a decade. Ursula became the composer's muse, helper and London companion, and later helped him care for his ailing wife. Whether Adeline knew, <b>or</b> <b>suspected,</b> that Ursula and Vaughan Williams were lovers is uncertain, but the relations between the two women were of warm friendship throughout the years they knew each other. The composer's concern for his first wife never faltered, according to Ursula, who admitted in the 1980s that she had been jealous of Adeline, whose place in Vaughan Williams's life and affections was unchallengeable.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid was {{associated}} with significantly greater mortality than the comparator antibiotics. When data from all participants were pooled, {{the study found that}} 21.5% of those given linezolid died, compared to 16% of those not receiving it. The difference was found to be due to the inferiority of linezolid in the treatment of Gram-negative infections alone or mixed Gram-negative/Gram-positive infections. In participants whose infection was due to Gram-positive bacteria alone, linezolid was as safe and effective as vancomycin. In light of these results, the FDA issued an alert reminding healthcare professionals that linezolid is not approved for the treatment of catheter-related infections or infections caused by Gram-negative organisms, and that more appropriate therapy should be instituted whenever a Gram-negative infection is confirmed <b>or</b> <b>suspected.</b>|$|E

By 25 April, several hundred known <b>or</b> <b>suspected</b> anti-fascists had been arrested by the Ustaše. Some were spared death and given prison sentences, but most were executed without trial.

The gray wolf and the vulnerable grizzly bear once lived in the watershed, but are now considered extirpated. Nineteen species of reptiles live in the area.

5|$|At this time, private loyalty-review {{boards and}} anti-communist {{investigators}} {{began to appear}} to fill a growing demand among certain industries to certify that their employees were above reproach. Companies that {{were concerned about the}} sensitivity of their business, or who, like the entertainment industry, felt particularly vulnerable to public opinion made use of these private services. For a fee, these teams would investigate employees and question them about their politics and affiliations. At such hearings, the subject would usually not have a right to the presence of an attorney, and as with HUAC, the interviewee might be asked to defend himself against accusations without being allowed to cross-examine the accuser. These agencies would keep cross-referenced lists of leftist organizations, publications, rallies, charities and the like, as well as lists of individuals who were known <b>or</b> <b>suspected</b> communists. Books such as Red Channels and newsletters such as Counterattack and Confidential Information were published to keep track of communist and leftist organizations and individuals. Insofar as the various blacklists of McCarthyism were actual physical lists, they were created and maintained by these private organizations.|$|E
5|$|Many {{classification}} {{systems have}} been developed {{in an effort to}} predict difficulty of tracheal intubation, including the Cormack-Lehane classification system, the Intubation Difficulty Scale (IDS), and the Mallampati score. The Mallampati score is drawn from the observation that the size of the base of the tongue influences the difficulty of intubation. It is determined by looking at the anatomy of the mouth, and in particular the visibility of the base of palatine uvula, faucial pillars and the soft palate. Although such medical scoring systems may aid in the evaluation of patients, no single score or combination of scores can be trusted to specifically detect all and only those patients who are difficult to intubate. Furthermore, one study of experienced anesthesiologists, on the widely used Cormack–Lehane classification system, found they did not score the same patients consistently over time, and that only 25% could correctly define all four grades of the widely used Cormack–Lehane classification system. Under certain emergency circumstances (e.g., severe head trauma <b>or</b> <b>suspected</b> cervical spine injury), it may be impossible to fully utilize these the physical examination and the various classification systems to predict the difficulty of tracheal intubation. In such cases, alternative techniques of securing the airway must be readily available.|$|E
5|$|NFL {{commissioner}} Roger Goodell {{addressed the}} issue of head injuries in professional football during a talk held on November 15, 2012 at the Harvard School of Public Health. In the talk, he highlighted the NFL's efforts to reduce head injuries by enacting measures such as penalizing hits to the head, better assessing concussions on the sideline, and removing players from the game after they have been diagnosed <b>or</b> <b>suspected</b> of having sustained a concussion. He also discussed the need for increased research on brain injuries and long-term disorders, and called for a culture change in the league, saying that players need to be more willing to acknowledge their injuries to medical staff. In September 2012 the league pledged a $30 million donation to the National Institutes of Health to research the connection between brain injuries and long-term mental health issues. Beginning in 2012 the NFL was the subject of several lawsuits initiated by former players who alleged that the league withheld information and misled players about the potential long-term impacts of head injuries. Six of the lawsuits were approved to be tried together. In August 2013 the NFL reached a settlement with more than 4,500 former players, agreeing to pay $765 million to be used to pay for medical examinations for former NFL players and for research and education purposes. Additionally, the funds will also be used to compensate former players who are determined to have significant cognitive impairment.|$|E

5|$|Whatever event {{eventually}} {{triggered the}} battle, it obviously altered the strategic or tactical balance sufficiently to induce the Athenians {{to attack the}} Persians. If the first theory is correct (see above), then the absence of cavalry removed the main Athenian tactical disadvantage, {{and the threat of}} being outflanked made it imperative to attack. Conversely, if the second theory is correct, then the Athenians were merely reacting to the Persians attacking them. Since the Persian force obviously contained a high proportion of missile troops, a static defensive position would have made little sense for the Athenians; the strength of the hoplite was in the melee, and the sooner that could be brought about, the better, from the Athenian point of view. If the second theory is correct, this raises the further question of why the Persians, having hesitated for several days, then attacked. There may have been several strategic reasons for this; perhaps they were aware (<b>or</b> <b>suspected)</b> that the Athenians were expecting reinforcements. Alternatively, since they may have felt the need to force some kind of victory—they could hardly remain at Marathon indefinitely.|$|E
