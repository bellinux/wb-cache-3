5|$|Deep Impact. Debate {{continues}} {{about how}} much ice is in a comet. In 2001, the Deep Space 1 spacecraft obtained high-resolution images of the surface <b>of</b> <b>Comet</b> Borrelly. It {{was found that the}} surface <b>of</b> <b>comet</b> Borrelly is hot and dry, with a temperature of between , and extremely dark, suggesting that the ice has been removed by solar heating and maturation, or is hidden by the soot-like material that covers Borrelly. In July 2005, the Deep Impact probe blasted a crater on Comet Tempel 1 to study its interior. The mission yielded results suggesting that the majority of a comet's water ice is below the surface and that these reservoirs feed the jets of vaporised water that form the coma of Tempel 1. Renamed EPOXI, it made a flyby <b>of</b> <b>Comet</b> Hartley 2 on 4 November 2010.|$|E

40|$|Empirical data {{related to}} {{questions}} regarding the origin <b>of</b> <b>comets</b> are examined, {{taking into account the}} primitive temperature and its evolution, the cometary C- 12 /C- 13 isotope ratio, the chemistry <b>of</b> <b>comets,</b> and the solar-system related orbits <b>of</b> the <b>comets.</b> The theories <b>of</b> cometary origin considered are related to a condensation <b>of</b> <b>comets</b> from the solar nebula and a later ejection into Oort's cloud, a recent condensation <b>of</b> <b>comets</b> in situ, a capture <b>of</b> interstellar <b>comets,</b> and a reversal of the arrow of time in the traditional evolution <b>of</b> <b>comets.</b> The only hypothesis which seems to survive an evaluation of the theories {{on the basis of the}} existing data is that the comets were condensed some five billion years ago in the vicinity of the giant planets or beyond, at the outer edge of the solar nebula...|$|R

5|$|Hale–Bopp {{showed the}} highest ever linear {{polarization}} detected for any comet. Such polarization {{is the result}} of solar radiation getting scattered by the dust particles in the coma of the comet and depends {{on the nature of the}} grains. It further confirms that the dust grains in the coma <b>of</b> <b>comet</b> Hale–Bopp were smaller than inferred in any other comet.|$|E
5|$|In times past, bright comets often {{inspired}} {{panic and}} hysteria {{in the general}} population, being thought of as bad omens. More recently, during the passage of Halley's Comet in 1910, the Earth passed through the comet's tail, and erroneous newspaper reports inspired a fear that cyanogen in the tail might poison millions, whereas the appearance <b>of</b> <b>Comet</b> Hale–Bopp in 1997 triggered the mass suicide of the Heaven's Gate cult.|$|E
40|$|The dynamic {{properties}} <b>of</b> <b>comets</b> entering the planetary zone from the Oort cloud are discussed. Even a very slight {{influence of the}} large planets can trigger stochastic cometary dynamics. Multiple interactions <b>of</b> <b>comets</b> with the large planets produce diffusion of the parameters of cometary orbits and a mean increase in the semi-major axis <b>of</b> <b>comets.</b> Comets are lifted towards the Oort cloud, where collisions with stars begin to play a substantial role. The transport <b>of</b> <b>comets</b> differs greatly from the customary law of diffusion and noticeably alter cometary distribution...|$|R

5|$|Its first {{extended}} {{visit was}} to do a flyby <b>of</b> <b>Comet</b> Boethin, but with some complications. On July 21, 2005 Deep Impact executed a trajectory correction maneuver that allows the spacecraft to use Earth's gravity to begin a new mission in a path towards another comet.|$|E
5|$|Sodium {{has also}} been {{detected}} in numerous Solar System environments, including Mercury's atmosphere, the exosphere of the Moon, and numerous other bodies. Some comets have a sodium tail, which was first detected in observations <b>of</b> <b>Comet</b> Hale-Bopp in 1997. Sodium has even been detected in the atmospheres of some extrasolar planets via transit spectroscopy.|$|E
5|$|The {{collision}} <b>of</b> <b>Comet</b> Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994 was fortuitously timed for astronomers, coming just a {{few months}} after Servicing Mission 1 had restored Hubble's optical performance. Hubble images of the planet were sharper than any taken since the passage of Voyager 2 in 1979, and were crucial in studying the dynamics of the collision of a comet with Jupiter, an event believed to occur once every few centuries.|$|E

50|$|Oppolzer {{authored}} over 300 papers, {{with most}} concerning the orbital elements <b>of</b> <b>comets</b> and asteroids. He also published a two-volume manual on {{the determination of}} the orbital elements <b>of</b> <b>comets</b> and planets.

40|$|The present {{volume on}} comets in the post-Halley era {{discusses}} observing techniques and intepretation, laboratory studies and simulations, {{the origin and}} evolution <b>of</b> <b>comets,</b> the cometary nucleus and coma, cometary dust, and plasmas and fields. Attention is given to IR techniques for comet observations, UV spectroscopy of cometary comae, radio interferometric imaging <b>of</b> <b>comets,</b> and irradiation effects on comets and cometary debris. Topics addressed include laboratory simulation of cometary structures, chemical theories on the origin <b>of</b> <b>comets,</b> biological implications <b>of</b> organic compounds in comets, the dynamic history of the Oort cloud, and physical aspects {{of the evolution of}} cometary debris. Also discussed are possible mechanisms of cometary outbursts, isotopic ratios in comets, the hydrogen clouds <b>of</b> <b>comets,</b> and physical and optical properties of cometary dust...|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of outgassing, comets leave in their wake a trail of solid debris too large to be swept away by {{radiation}} pressure and the solar wind. If the Earth's orbit sends it though that debris, there {{are likely to be}} meteor showers as Earth passes through. The Perseid meteor shower, for example, occurs every year between 9 and 13 August, when Earth passes through the orbit <b>of</b> <b>Comet</b> Swift–Tuttle. Halley's Comet {{is the source of the}} Orionid shower in October.|$|E
5|$|Circinus is {{the radiant}} of an annual meteor shower, the Alpha Circinids (ACI). First {{observed}} in Queensland in 1977, the meteors {{have an average}} velocity of 27.1km/s and {{are thought to be}} associated with a long-period comet. In 2011, Peter Jenniskens proposed that the debris trail <b>of</b> <b>comet</b> C/1969 T1 could intersect with the Earth's orbit and generate a meteor outburst coming from a radiant close to Beta Circini. The ACI shower peaks on 4 June, the day it was first observed.|$|E
5|$|Impacts {{are thought}} to be a regular (if {{currently}} infrequent) part of the evolution of the Solar System. That they continue to happen is evidenced by the collision <b>of</b> <b>Comet</b> Shoemaker–Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994, the 2009 Jupiter impact event, the Tunguska event, the Chelyabinsk meteor and the impact feature Meteor Crater in Arizona. The process of accretion, therefore, is not complete, and may still pose a threat to life on Earth.|$|E
40|$|In {{historical}} records, {{twenty four}} candidates of possible Kreutz sungrazing comets have been found, and their times of perihelion passage estimated. Translated original records <b>of</b> <b>comets</b> with presumed ephemerides are given. Some uncertain candidates are also presented. Although already suggested by Marsden (1967, Astron. Jahresber. 67. 9133), our calculations on the motions <b>of</b> <b>comets</b> 1882 R 1 and 1965 S 1 {{confirm that the}} progenitor <b>of</b> these <b>comets</b> is a comet that appeared in 1106; some trials on the linkage <b>of</b> sungrazing <b>comets</b> are discussed...|$|R

5|$|In 1997 a {{paper was}} {{published}} that hypothesised {{the existence of}} a binary nucleus to fully explain the observed pattern <b>of</b> <b>comet</b> Hale–Bopp's dust emission observed in October 1995. The paper was based on theoretical analysis, and did not claim an observational detection of the proposed satellite nucleus, but estimated that it would have a diameter of about 30km, with the main nucleus being about 70km across, and would orbit in about three days at a distance of about 180km. This analysis was confirmed by observations in 1996 using Wide-Field Planetary Camera 2 of the Hubble Space Telescope which had taken images of the comet that revealed the satellite.|$|E
5|$|The Galileo {{spacecraft}} was {{the first}} to have entered orbit around Jupiter, arriving in 1995 and studying the planet until 2003. During this period Galileo gathered a large amount of information about the Jovian system, making close approaches to all of the four large Galilean moons and finding evidence for thin atmospheres on three of them, as well as the possibility of liquid water beneath their surfaces. It also discovered a magnetic field around Ganymede. As it approached Jupiter, it also witnessed the impact <b>of</b> <b>Comet</b> Shoemaker–Levy 9. In December 1995, it sent an atmospheric probe into the Jovian atmosphere, so far the only craft to do so.|$|E
5|$|The {{collision}} <b>of</b> <b>Comet</b> Shoemaker–Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994 {{demonstrated that}} gravitational interactions can fragment a comet, {{giving rise to}} many impacts {{over a period of}} a few days if the comet should collide with a planet. Comets undergo gravitational interactions with the gas giants, and similar disruptions and collisions are very likely to have occurred in the past. This scenario may have occurred on Earth {{at the end of the}} Cretaceous, though Shiva and the Chicxulub craters might have been formed 300,000 years apart.|$|E
50|$|Solem’s {{work on the}} {{interception}} and deflection <b>of</b> <b>comets</b> and asteroids on {{collision course}} with Earth (1993a, 2000) also led to a theory {{of the origin of}} the shape of rubble-pile asteroids. His analytic theory of the breakup <b>of</b> <b>comets</b> by planetary tidal forces resulted in his calculation of the diameter and density <b>of</b> the parent <b>comet</b> <b>of</b> Shoemaker-Levy 9 as it was before breaking up in the tidal field of Jupiter in 1994 (1994a).|$|R
40|$|The origin <b>of</b> <b>comets</b> and the {{evolution}} of their orbits are discussed. Factors considered include: the law <b>of</b> survival <b>of</b> <b>comets</b> against ejection on hyperbolic orbits; short-period comets are not created by single close encounters <b>of</b> near-parabolic <b>comets</b> with Jupiter; observable long-period comets do not evolve into observable short-period comets; unobservable long-period comets with perihelia near Jupiter can evolve into observable short-period comets; long-period comets cannot have been formed or created within the planetary region of the solar system (excluding the effects of stellar perturbations); it is possible that some <b>of</b> the short-period <b>comets</b> could have been formed inside the orbit of Neptune; circularly-restricted three-body problem, and its associated Jacobi integral, are not valid approximations to use in studying origin and evolution <b>of</b> <b>comets...</b>|$|R
40|$|The proposal, revived by Tremaine and Zytkow (1985), that {{accretion}} <b>of</b> <b>comets</b> by {{neutron stars}} {{may be the}} origin of gamma-ray bursts is considered. This mechanism has difficulty accounting for the observed gamma-ray spectrum and optical counterparts of the bursts. The survival <b>of</b> <b>comets</b> near supernovae is investigated. Ablation rates and the thermal structure of an ablating surface layer are calculated. In some circumstances, mechanical disruption will erode a comet more rapidly than evaporation. The accretion <b>of</b> <b>comets</b> by neutron stars may produce a class of X-ray burst sources with novel properties...|$|R
5|$|The first {{spacecraft}} to orbit Jupiter was the Galileo probe, which entered orbit on December 7, 1995. It orbited the planet for over seven years, conducting multiple flybys {{of all the}} Galilean moons and Amalthea. The spacecraft also witnessed the impact <b>of</b> <b>Comet</b> Shoemaker–Levy 9 as it approached Jupiter in 1994, giving a unique vantage point for the event. Its originally designed capacity was limited by the failed deployment of its high-gain radio antenna, although extensive information was still gained about the Jovian system from Galileo.|$|E
5|$|A {{permanent}} asymmetric moon {{dust cloud}} exists around the Moon, created by small particles from comets. Estimates are 5 tons <b>of</b> <b>comet</b> particles strike the Moon's surface each 24 hours. The particles strike the Moon's surface ejecting moon dust above the Moon. The dust stays above the Moon approximately 10 minutes, taking 5 minutes to rise, and 5 minutes to fall. On average, 120 kilograms of dust are present above the Moon, rising to 100 kilometers above the surface. The dust measurements {{were made by}} LADEE's Lunar Dust EXperiment (LDEX), between 20 and 100 kilometers above the surface, during a six-month period. LDEX detected an average of one 0.3 micrometer moon dust particle each minute. Dust particle counts peaked during the Geminid, Quadrantid, Northern Taurid, and Omicron Centaurid meteor showers, when the Earth, and Moon, pass through comet debris. The cloud is asymmetric, more dense near {{the boundary between the}} Moon's dayside and nightside.|$|E
5|$|Cameras on the Galileo {{spacecraft}} observed fragments <b>of</b> <b>Comet</b> Shoemaker–Levy9 between 16 and 22 July 1994 as they {{collided with}} Jupiter's southern hemisphere {{at a speed}} of approximately 60kilometres per second. This was the first direct observation of an extraterrestrial collision of solar system objects. While the impacts {{took place on the}} side of Jupiter hidden from Earth, Galileo, then at a distance of 1.6AU from the planet, was able to see the impacts as they occurred. Its instruments detected a fireball that reached a peak temperature of about 24,000K, compared to the typical Jovian cloudtop temperature of about 130K (−143°C), with the plume from the fireball reaching a height of over 3,000km.|$|E
40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that the {{exploration}} and characterization <b>of</b> <b>comets</b> can play a fundamental role in solar system science. Comets are probably primitive products of processes which occurred in the preplanetary solar nebula. The impending return <b>of</b> Halley's <b>comet</b> in 1986 provides an opportunity for a study <b>of</b> <b>comets,</b> and five spacecraft will be launched to intercept Halley. These spacecraft include two sent by the USSR, two by Japan, and one by the European Space Agency (ESA). NASA has recommended two programs for the exploration and characterization <b>of</b> <b>comets.</b> The first mission considered would be a rendezvous with a short-period comet, while the second mission would provide for the return to earth of a sample of the volatile and nonvolatile constituents of the coma <b>of</b> a <b>comet.</b> Developments related to these plans are discussed...|$|R
