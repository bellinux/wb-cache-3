Kill Yr Idols was released the same year, under the German label Zensor Records. Bad Moon Rising was released {{two years later}} <b>on</b> <b>Blast</b> First, a label created specifically for Sonic Youth releases. In 1986 Sonic Youth signed to SST Records and released EVOL later the same year. The album gained the band increasing critical acclaim and exposure, and the group released Sister and the double LP Daydream Nation in 1987 and 1988 respectively, the latter on Enigma Records.|$|E

500|$|The song {{provided}} the title to Starr's 2007 career-spanning compilation , having earlier appeared <b>on</b> <b>Blast</b> from Your Past (1975), a greatest-hits collection covering his years on Apple Records. For the 1991 CD reissue of Ringo, {{the album was}} expanded through the inclusion of three bonus tracks, the last {{of which was the}} long-unavailable [...] "Down and Out".

500|$|From August 1944 Fuchs {{worked in}} the Theoretical Physics Division at the Los Alamos Laboratory, under Hans Bethe. His chief area of {{expertise}} was the problem of imploding the fissionable core of the plutonium bomb. At one point, Fuchs did calculation work that Edward Teller had refused to do {{because of lack of}} interest. He was the author of techniques (such as the still-used Fuchs-Nordheim method) for calculating the energy of a fissile assembly that goes highly prompt critical, and his report <b>on</b> <b>blast</b> waves is still considered a classic. Later, he also filed a patent with John von Neumann, describing a method to initiate fusion in a thermonuclear weapon with an implosion trigger. Fuchs was one of the many Los Alamos scientists present at the Trinity test. Bethe considered Fuchs [...] "one of the most valuable men in my division" [...] and [...] "one of the best theoretical physicists we had." ...|$|E

Jordan Sargent of Complex magazine wrote in his review of the video that it recalls and showcases [...] "the joyous adrenaline rush" [...] of falling in love. He described the tone as [...] "appropriate" [...] and {{different from the rest of}} the videos on the album and noted that its director used pink and blue colors in the scenes to capture the feel of [...] "budding romance". Tyler Hanan from the website Under the Gun Review wrote that the video has [...] "all lights <b>on</b> <b>blast</b> and all ages included" [...] and added that it was complete with [...] "smiles, joy, and good-natured silliness".|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{two-dimensional}} discrete element program (UDEC) {{is applied}} to simulate the dampi-ng effect of empty holes <b>on</b> <b>blasting</b> vibration. The {{results show that the}} peak particle velocity of monitoring point on the condition that there are empty holes between monitoring point and blast hole is less than that without empty holes. The factors which have impact on cushioning effect, such as the depth of empty hole, the diameter of empty hole, the distance between empty hole and blast hole and the rows of empty hole, are investigated numerically. It is found that the depth of empty hole has dominated influence on the damping effect and the damping effect <b>on</b> <b>blasting</b> vibration strengthens with the increment of the depth. The diameter of empty hole and the distance between empty hole and blast hole have slight influence on the damping effect. The increment of rows of empty hole can enhance the damping effect <b>on</b> <b>blasting</b> vibration as well. The results in the present study may provide a reference for the application of empty hole to reduce the blasting vibration in practical engineering...|$|R

500|$|Among {{the notable}} {{omissions}} from The Best of George Harrison, in author Robert Rodriguez's opinion, were [...] "Isn't It a Pity" [...] – {{one half of}} the double A-side single with [...] "My Sweet Lord", and a number 1 hit in Canada in its own right – and [...] "Ding Dong, Ding Dong", which charted just inside the top 40 in the main markets of America and Britain but was a top ten hit in Europe. In comparison, Shaved Fish had contained [...] "Happy Xmas (War Is Over)", [...] "Mother" [...] and [...] "Woman Is the Nigger of the World", singles which, on the US Billboard Hot 100, respectively: did not chart at all; peaked at number 43; and reached number 57. <b>On</b> <b>Blast</b> from Your Past, the non-album B-side [...] "Early 1970" [...] was included, as were [...] "I'm the Greatest" [...] (an album track never released as a single) and [...] "Beaucoups of Blues", which peaked at number 87 in the United States. On those terms, Harrison had the popular 1971 B-sides [...] "Apple Scruffs" [...] and [...] "Deep Blue"; [...] "Ding Dong", which peaked at number 36 on Billboard; and highly regarded album tracks such as [...] "All Things Must Pass", [...] "Beware of Darkness" [...] and [...] "Living in the Material World". Commentators have remarked also on the brevity of Starr's album, at just 30 minutes in length, whereas Capitol felt the need to achieve a running time of 45 minutes for the Harrison compilation.|$|E

2500|$|... "Stugotz' Weekend Observations" [...] — on Mondays, Stugotz {{gives his}} game {{notes from the}} {{previous}} weekend's sporting events. Before the segment, Papi claims, [...] "Nobody in the media {{will tell you what}} happened better than my boy Stu." [...] Weiner frequently shouts, [...] "Daaaaan!" [...] before he gives a hot take, and has been known to use very anti-climactic knock-knock jokes. [...] After each game note, Mike gives a beep sound. Stugotz has understandably been known to put Sean Miller <b>on</b> <b>blast</b> during this segment, and often closes the segment by telling sports figures or teams that they should say hello to Art Briles in Hell. Dan Le Batard has been openly opposed to this segment, but the listeners have frequently voted in favor of this segment. In June 2016, much to the disappointment of his fans, Stugotz admitted that he doesn't write all of the game notes.|$|E
6000|$|As {{one that}} in a silver vision floats Obedient to the sweep of odorous winds Upon resplendent clouds, so rapidly Along the dark and ruffled waters fled The {{straining}} boat.--A whirlwind swept it on, [...] 320 With fierce gusts and precipitating force, Through the white ridges of the chafed sea. The waves arose. Higher and higher still Their fierce necks writhed beneath the tempest's scourge Like serpents struggling in a vulture's grasp. [...] 325 Calm and rejoicing in the fearful war Of wave ruining on wave, and blast <b>on</b> <b>blast</b> Descending, and black flood on whirlpool driven With dark obliterating course, he sate: As if their genii were the ministers [...] 330 Appointed to conduct him to the light Of those beloved eyes, the Poet sate, Holding the steady helm. Evening came on, The beams of sunset hung their rainbow hues High 'mid the shifting domes of sheeted spray [...] 335 That canopied his path o'er the waste deep; Twilight, ascending slowly from the east, Entwined in duskier wreaths her braided locks O'er the fair front and radiant eyes of day; Night followed, clad with stars. On every side [...] 340 More horribly the multitudinous streams Of ocean's mountainous waste to mutual war Rushed in dark tumult thundering, as to mock The calm and spangled sky. The little boat Still fled before the storm; still fled, like foam [...] 345 Down the steep cataract of a wintry river; Now pausing {{on the edge of}} the riven wave; Now leaving far behind the bursting mass That fell, convulsing ocean: safely fled-- As if that frail and wasted human form, [...] 350 Had been an elemental god.|$|E
