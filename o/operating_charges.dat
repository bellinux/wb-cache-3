40|$|Although {{building}} <b>operating</b> <b>charges</b> {{have turned}} out to be a major determinant of profitability for real estate investments, there is a noticeable lack of reports or studies that analyze these costs with state-of-the-art statistical techniques. Specifically, past studies usually assume linear relationships between costs and building attributes, they do not control for cluster-specific or longitudinal effects and do not account for the simultaneous structure of cost categories. Therefore, in this study we provide a novel approach to real estate cost benchmarking: We analyze the effects of building attributes on electricity, heating and maintenance costs for office buildings in Germany in a multivariate structured additive regression (STAR) model simultaneously, modeling potentially nonlinear effects as P(enalized) -Splines and controlling for cluster-specific and individual heterogeneity in a three-way random effects structure. This way, we gain insights into how building attributes influence costs, and how cost levels vary across cities, companies and buildings. We furthermore derive quality-adjusted time indices for the two major German submarkets, the former German Democratic Republic and the old West German states. The results obtained can be used to derive portfolio allocation strategies and for planning, constructing, operating and redeveloping real estate.

40|$|Cloud Computing is an {{evolving}} area of efficient utilization of computing resources. Data centers accommodating Cloud applications ingest massive quantities of energy, contributing to high functioning expenditures and carbon footprints to the atmosphere. Hence, Green Cloud computing resolutions are required {{not only to}} save energy for the environment but also to decrease <b>operating</b> <b>charges.</b> In this paper, we emphasis {{on the development of}} energy based resource scheduling framework and present an algorithm that consider the synergy between various data center infrastructures (i. e., software, hardware, etc.), and performance. In specific, this paper proposes (a) architectural principles for energy efficient management of Clouds; (b) energy efficient resource allocation strategies and scheduling algorithm considering Quality of Service (QoS) outlooks. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been evaluated with the existing energy based scheduling algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that this approach is effective in minimizing the cost and energy consumption of Cloud applications thus moving towards the achievement of Green Clouds...|$|E
30|$|Within {{a context}} of {{moderate}} traffic growth, there can be competition between infrastructures that {{make it impossible to}} attain the expected traffic and profitability levels. For example, questions are currently being asked as to whether there is sufficient traffic to make the Sud Europe Atlantique high speed railway line now under construction profitable due to its competition with a standard performance railway line (220  km/h as opposed to 300  km/h for the high speed railway line) and much less expensive for operators. This line will cost them € 11 /train.km as opposed to € 18 /train.km for the high speed railway line. This line will also be in competition with the Paris Bordeaux, Toulouse and Biarritz airline routes whose prices are competitive with those of high speed railway lines for passengers. The issue of the number of trains on the high speed railway lines {{has been the subject of}} debate as the high cost of tolls paid to concession-holders is susceptible to reducing road traffic. In addition, the high cost of the toll rate could disturb the concession’s balance between insufficient toll revenues and high investment and <b>operating</b> <b>charges.</b>|$|E
40|$|Poverty {{is among}} {{the root causes of}} death and poor health worldwide. Project HOPE’s Village Health Bank (VHB) program is a public health {{intervention}} that combines integrated microcredit lending and health education. Groups of 18 to 25 women receive small loans, and biweekly, one-hour health education sessions. Since 1993, about 50, 000 women in 949 VHBs have participated in seven countries in the Americas, Africa, and Southeast Asia, receiving more than US$ 25 million in loans and 8, 445 hours of health education. Members of VHBs are charged modest interest rates that enable them to become self-sufficient (eg, able to cover all <b>operating</b> <b>charges,</b> including the costs of the health education staff, and the necessary loan capital to continue without infusion of outside resources). The VHB program produces substantial economic improvements for individuals and groups, and benefits in health knowledge and behaviors, including increased utilization of healthcare services. Data from Guatemala, Malawi, and Thailand demonstrate that VHBs in countries with high HIV prevalence have been comparably successful in spite of the enormous added burdens of chronic illness, deaths, and orphans in need of support. For example, in 2004, 48 percent of 266 VHB members in Malawi experienced at least one death in their household in the preceding year, and 67 percent housed one or more orphans with an average of two orphans per household. Because of the unique combination of increased household economic stability and improved health knowledge, the VHB program is now being adapted to families of people affected by HIV/AIDS, including orphans...|$|E

40|$|International audienceEmbedded cache {{memories}} consumes a {{large percentage}} of the dynamic and static energy in System-On-Chip (SoC). Energy consumption expects to increase in advanced technologies. Write and read operations <b>operate</b> <b>charging</b> and discharging of large bitline capacitances. Multiplexors are introduced in 6 T-SRAM to reduce column size. Unfortunately read current is not reduced and even increases. Considering the 5 T Portless SRAM, an original multiplexor structure is presented that offers a significant gain in active energy consumption. The multiplexor benefits from a hard line duplication technique that copies an addressed line into an other line in one clock cycle. The advantages of the latter duplication technique are presented in details. Moreover Portless bit cell is more stable, suffers less leakage than 6 T SRAM bitcell. The paper confirms that Portless SRAM is a candidate alternative structure to 6 T SRAM in advanced technologies...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a network of}} electric vehicles (EVs) and its components: vehicles, charging stations, and coalitions of stations. For such a setting, we propose a model in which individual stations, coalitions of stations, and vehicles interact in a market revolving around the energy for battery recharge. We start by separately studying 1) how autonomously <b>operated</b> <b>charging</b> stations form coalitions; 2) the price policy enacted by such coalitions; and 3) how vehicles select the charging station to use, working toward a time/price tradeoff. Our main goal is to investigate how equilibrium in such a market can be reached. We also {{address the issue of}} computational complexity, showing that, through our model, equilibria can be found in polynomial time. We evaluate our model in a realistic scenario, focusing on its ability to capture the advantages of the availability of an intelligent transportation system supporting the EV drivers. The model also mimics the anticompetitive behavior that charging stations are likely to follow, and it highlights the effect of possible countermeasures to such a behavior...|$|R
