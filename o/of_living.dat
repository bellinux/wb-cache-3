40|$|This paper {{discusses}} quantum-inspired models <b>of</b> <b>Livings</b> {{from the}} viewpoint of information processing. The model <b>of</b> <b>Livings</b> consists <b>of</b> motor dynamics simulating actual behavior of the object, and mental dynamics representing evolution of the corresponding knowledge-base and incorporating it in the form of information flows into the motor dynamics. Due to feedback from mental dynamics, the motor dynamics attains quantum-like properties: its trajectory splits into a family of different trajectories, and each of those trajectories can be chosen with the probability prescribed by the mental dynamics The paper concentrates on discovery of a new type of entanglement that correlates the probabilities <b>of</b> actions <b>of</b> <b>Livings</b> rather than the actions themselves...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To explore whether {{persons with}} right- and {{left-sided}} cerebrovascular accidents differ significantly in mean impact of neurobehavioural impairments on {{ability to perform}} activities <b>of</b> daily <b>living.</b> Design and subjects: Retrospective study of data from 215 persons (103 right-sided, 112 left-sided cerebrovascular accident). The Activities of daily living-focused Occupation-based Neurobehavioral Evaluation {{was used to evaluate}} ability on an activities <b>of</b> daily <b>living</b> scale and the impact of neurobehavioural impairment on ability on another scale. Methods: To control for possible differences in activities <b>of</b> daily <b>living</b> ability between groups, analysis of covariance, with activities <b>of</b> daily <b>living</b> ability as a covariate, was used to test for a significant difference in impact of neurobehavioural impairments on activities <b>of</b> daily <b>living</b> ability between groups. Results: Expected moderate correlation (r=- 0. 57) was obtained between activities <b>of</b> daily <b>living</b> ability and neurobehavioural impact measures, and {{there was no difference in}} mean neurobehavioural impact measures between groups (F [1, 212] = 2. 910,p = 0. 090). Conclusion: This study is the first: to explore directly the impact of neurobehavioural impairment on activities <b>of</b> daily <b>living</b> ability. While persons with right-sided and left-sided cerebrovascular accidents may differ in type of neurobehavioural impairments, direct evaluation of the impact of such impairments on activities <b>of</b> daily <b>living</b> ability reveals no difference between groups...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To explore construct(s) (ability, capability, actual performance, and/or {{perceived}} difficulty) {{of activities}} <b>of</b> daily <b>living</b> measures {{that have been}} used in randomized controlled trials. Methods: Three databases (Medline, CINAHL, and OTSeeker) were searched. A questionnaire was sent to the author of each eligible study requesting information about the activities <b>of</b> daily <b>living</b> construct(s) that were adopted in his/her study. Results: A total of 106 studies, which altogether used 17 different activities <b>of</b> daily <b>living</b> measures, were found. Among these, only 12 studies specified in the paper the activities <b>of</b> daily <b>living</b> construct assessed; 7 studies assessed “ability” and 5 assessed “actual performance”. Only 20 % of the randomized controlled trials authors reported the mode of administration in the paper. Authors of 34 studies replied to our questionnaire. The most commonly used activities <b>of</b> daily <b>living</b> measures (i. e. the Barthel Index (either the 0 – 20 or 0 – 100 scoring version) and the Functional Independence Measure) were employed for assessing various constructs of activities <b>of</b> daily <b>living,</b> with inconsistency between the studies. Conclusion: In stroke randomized controlled trials that measured activities <b>of</b> daily <b>living</b> as an outcome, the measures were used for assessing various construct(s) of activities <b>of</b> daily <b>living</b> (including ability, capability, actual performance, and/or perceived difficulty).

40|$|Purpose: To {{explore the}} {{relationship}} between prefracture sociodemographic and health characteristics, basic activities <b>of</b> daily <b>living,</b> instrumental activities <b>of</b> daily <b>living</b> and perceived health 3 months after a hip fracture aged 65 or older. Methods: Age, sex, living alone or not, use of walking aids and whether they had experienced another fall during the previous 6 months, were recorded in hospital and at a threemonth follow-up. A total of 277 patients were included. The Barthel Index, the Nottingham Extended ADL Index, the Short Form- 12 questionnaire, and the Mini Mental State Examination were used. Results: Prefracture use of a walking aid outdoors was a predictor of postfracture dependency in basic activities of daily living: odds ratio (OR) 2. 0, 95 % confidence intervals (CI 1. 1 – 3. 6), reduced score in instrumental activities <b>of</b> daily <b>living</b> (OR 1. 8; 95 % CI 1. 0 – 3. 2) and reduced perceived physical health (p = 0. 04).
