5|$|The <b>Ole</b> Miss Rebels, led by {{head coach}} John Vaught, earned a regular-season record of 631 {{prior to the}} Liberty Bowl. Vaught remains the all-time leader in wins at <b>Ole</b> Miss, {{and at the time}} of Mississippi's {{selection}} for the 1968 Liberty Bowl, he had already led the Rebels to three national championships and six Southeastern Conference championships, the most recent of each coming in 1962. On the field, <b>Ole</b> Miss featured star quarterback Archie Manning, who despite being just a sophomore, was already making a name for himself and would later go on to set records for passing yardage and passing touchdowns for <b>Ole</b> Miss, en route to becoming one of the greatest quarterbacks in Mississippi history.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} quarter, Mississippi came {{storming}} back. Following the field goal, Tech head coach Jerry Claiborne ordered an onside kick {{in an effort}} to gain another chance on offense and potentially build an insurmountable lead. Onside kicks, unlike an ordinary free kick, can be recovered by the kicking team—but only after the ball has traveled 10 yards. If the kicking team touches the ball before it has traveled 10 yards, the receiving team takes possession at the place the ball was touched. Unfortunately for Virginia Tech, Simsak's onside kick—though it surprised <b>Ole</b> Miss—did not travel the requisite 10 yards. Mississippi took over at the Virginia Tech 49-yard line, and many of the <b>Ole</b> Miss players were angered by what they considered to be an insult.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ole</b> Miss {{wasted no}} time in scoring, as Steve Hindman turned the first play of the second half into a 79-yard for a touchdown. The Rebels now held a 2117 lead, and Virginia Tech never {{threatened}} afterward. <b>Ole</b> Miss defender Bob Bailey intercepted a Virginia Tech pass {{at the beginning of the}} fourth quarter and returned it 70 yards for another Mississippi touchdown. The Rebels also added a pair of field goals to their score, and rolled to a 3417 victory over Virginia Tech.|$|E

5|$|While {{the human}} and {{property}} losses were staggering, the cultural loss is still felt today. The University of Copenhagen library was without a doubt the greatest and the most frequently mentioned of such. 35,000texts and a large archive of historical documents disappeared in the flames. Original works from the historians Hans Svaning, Anders Sørensen Vedel, Niels Krag, and Arild Huitfeldt and the scientists <b>Ole</b> Worm, <b>Ole</b> Rømer, Tycho Brahe and the brothers Hans and Caspar Bartholin were lost. Atlas Danicus by Peder Hansen Resen and the archive of Zealand Diocese went up in flames as well. The archive of the diocese had been moved to the university library the very same day the fire started.|$|E

Jeff Scott scored on a one-yard touchdown run to cap a 5-play, 72-yard drive to give <b>Ole</b> Miss their only lead of the game at 7–0. Alabama responded on the following drive with {{the first of four}} Trent Richardson touchdowns of the evening on an eight-yard run to tie the game at 7–7. The Crimson Tide added ten points in the second quarter to take a 17–7 halftime lead. Richardson scored on a seven-yard touchdown and after Cade Foster missed a 53-yard field goal attempt, Jeremy Shelley connected for 24-yard field goal.|$|E
