5|$|A {{person with}} cholangitis may {{complain}} of abdominal pain (particularly {{in the right}} upper quadrant of the abdomen), fever, rigors (uncontrollable shaking) {{and a feeling of}} uneasiness (malaise). Some may report jaundice (yellow discoloration of the skin and the whites <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes).</b>|$|E

5|$|According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, {{short-term}} {{exposure to}} platinum salts may cause irritation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> nose, and throat, and long-term exposure may cause both respiratory and skin allergies. The current OSHA standard is 2micrograms {{per cubic meter}} of air averaged over an 8-hour work shift. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) for platinum as 1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday.|$|E
5|$|Graves' {{disease is}} an {{autoimmune}} disorder {{that is the}} most common cause of hyperthyroidism. In Graves' disease, for an unknown reason autoantibodies develop against the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor. These antibodies activate the receptor, leading to development of a goitre and symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as heat intolerance, weight loss, diarrhoea and palpitations. Occasionally such antibodies block but do not activate the receptor, leading to symptoms associated with hypothyroidism. In addition, gradual protrusion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> may occur, called Graves' ophthalmopathy, as may swelling of the front of the shins. Graves' disease can be diagnosed by the presence of pathomnomonic features such as involvement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> and shins, or isolation of autoantibodies, or by results of a radiolabelled uptake scan. Graves' disease is treated with anti-thyroid drugs such as propylthiouracil, which decrease the production of thyroid hormones, but hold a high rate of relapse. If there is no involvement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> then use of radioactive isotopes to ablate the gland may be considered. Surgical removal of the gland with subsequent thyroid hormone replacement may be considered, however this will not control symptoms associated with the eye or skin.|$|E
5|$|Severe malaria {{is usually}} caused by P.falciparum (often {{referred}} to as falciparum malaria). Symptoms of falciparum malaria arise 9–30 days after infection. Individuals with cerebral malaria frequently exhibit neurological symptoms, including abnormal posturing, nystagmus, conjugate gaze palsy (failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> to turn {{together in the same}} direction), opisthotonus, seizures, or coma.|$|E
50|$|M. nannoculus can be {{distinguished}} from other members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Microsynodontis genus by examining <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye.</b> <b>The</b> diameter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> is only about 10% to 12% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> standard length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fish, whereas <b>the</b> diameter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>of</b> all other species in the genus ranges from about 13% to 26%.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> {{vertical}} distances <b>of</b> <b>the</b> openings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> sockets <b>of</b> Mongoloids are <b>the</b> longest, <b>the</b> vertical distances <b>of</b> <b>the</b> openings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> sockets <b>of</b> Europeans are intermediate, and <b>the</b> vertical distances <b>of</b> <b>the</b> openings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> sockets <b>of</b> aboriginal Australians and Melanesians are the shortest.|$|R
50|$|The extraocular muscles develop {{along with}} Tenon's capsule (part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ligaments) and <b>the</b> fatty tissue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> socket (orbit). There are three centers of growth that are {{important}} in <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye,</b> and each is associated with a nerve. Hence the subsequent nerve supply (innervation) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> muscles is from three cranial nerves. <b>The</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extraocular muscles is dependent on <b>the</b> normal development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> socket, while <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ligament is fully independent.|$|R
5|$|The dusky woodswallow is {{medium-sized}} and swallow-like, with a {{dark brown}} hue, {{but there have been}} instances where the bird has appeared grey. The birds have a black patch in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> and grey (sometimes also black) wings with white streaks on them. The dusky woodswallow has a black, white-tipped tail with a silver underwing. The birds have a blue-grey bill capped with black.|$|E
5|$|The text {{begins by}} stating {{the size of}} the bird. Bewick then {{describes}} the bird, typically in one paragraph, naming any notable features such as the colour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> ("irides"), the bill, the legs, and plumage on each part of the body. Next, the origin and distribution of the species are discussed, with notes or quotations from authorities such as John Ray, Gilbert White and Buffon.|$|E
5|$|The {{well-developed}} compound {{eyes were}} stalked. The striking morphological similarities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> of Waptia fieldensis {{to that of}} extant mysid shrimp make it very likely that they were capable of producing true visual images or were at least sensitive to motion. A median eye may have also been present. Nervous tissue, including a putative brain, has been identified.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> {{computerized}} model <b>of</b> static eye-muscle mechanics {{developed by}} Robinson was revised extensively and improved. An extensive literature study yielded {{additional information on}} <b>the</b> average diameter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> as related to age, on <b>the</b> average location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> insertions and origins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> muscles, and on the average cross-sectional area and length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> muscles...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> {{remained}} <b>the</b> same as {{the previous}} year, but a different art design was used. <b>The</b> <b>eye</b> was multi-coloured with black and white stripes beaming from <b>the</b> pupil <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|R
30|$|The JEER {{procedure}} {{is divided into}} two steps, namely, Step 1 and Step 2. Step 1 (‘possible areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> region’), which is described in Section  3.1, circles <b>the</b> possible areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> region in <b>the</b> detection window. Step 2 (‘necessary condition for existence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> region area’), which is described in Section  3.2, indicates the necessary condition for <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> region area in the detection window. Finally, the nonface image is filtered, or <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> region area is defined. <b>The</b> details <b>of</b> <b>the</b> JEER algorithm are presented in Algorithm 2.|$|R
5|$|Cholangitis can be life-threatening, and is {{regarded}} as a medical emergency. Characteristic symptoms include yellow discoloration of the skin or whites <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> fever, abdominal pain, and in severe cases, low blood pressure and confusion. Initial treatment is with intravenous fluids and antibiotics, but there is often an underlying problem (such as gallstones or narrowing in the bile duct) for which further tests and treatments may be necessary, usually in the form of endoscopy to relieve obstruction of the bile duct. The word is from Greek chol-, bile + ang-, vessel + -itis, inflammation.|$|E
5|$|Damage to nerves III, IV, or VI {{may affect}} the {{movement}} of the eyeball (globe). Both or one eye may be affected; in either case double vision (diplopia) will likely occur because the movements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> are no longer synchronized. Nerves III, IV and VI are tested by observing how the eye follows an object in different directions. This object may be a finger or a pin, and may be moved at different directions to test for pursuit velocity. If the eyes do not work together, the most likely cause is damage to a specific cranial nerve or its nuclei.|$|E
5|$|Elemental {{fluorine}} {{is highly}} toxic to living organisms. Its effects in humans start at concentrations lower than hydrogen cyanide's 50 ppm and {{are similar to}} those of chlorine: significant irritation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> and respiratory system as well as liver and kidney damage occur above 25 ppm, which is the immediately dangerous to life and health value for fluorine. Eyes and noses are seriously damaged at 100 ppm, and inhalation of 1,000 ppm fluorine will cause death in minutes, compared to 270 ppm for hydrogen cyanide.|$|E
5000|$|Getting {{a regular}} eye exam {{may play a}} role in {{identifying}} <b>the</b> signs <b>of</b> some systemic diseases. [...] "The eye is composed of many different types of tissue. This unique feature makes <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> susceptible to a wide variety of diseases as well as provides insights into many body systems. Almost any part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> can give important clues to <b>the</b> diagnosis <b>of</b> systemic diseases. Signs of a systemic disease may be evident on <b>the</b> outer surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> (eyelids, conjunctiva and cornea), middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> and at <b>the</b> back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> (retina)." ...|$|R
5000|$|Corneal {{abrasion}} - {{a medical}} condition involving <b>the</b> loss <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surface epithelial layer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye's</b> cornea as a result <b>of</b> trauma to <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|R
50|$|The EyePro {{is shaped}} to conform to <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> socket, has a {{transparent}} centre for monitoring <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> throughout <b>the</b> procedure, and has non-stick tabs on both sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> for application and removal.|$|R
5|$|Encephalopathy often occurs {{together}} with other symptoms and signs of liver failure. These may include jaundice (yellow discolouration of the skin and the whites <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes),</b> ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity), and peripheral edema (swelling of the legs due to fluid build-up in the skin). The tendon reflexes may be exaggerated, and the plantar reflex may be abnormal, namely extending rather than flexing (Babinski's sign) in severe encephalopathy. A particular smell (foetor hepaticus) may be detected.|$|E
5|$|Eyes: Kayser–Fleischer rings (KF rings), a {{pathognomonic}} sign, may {{be visible}} in the cornea <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> either directly or on slit lamp examination as deposits of copper in a ring around the cornea. They are due to copper deposition in Descemet's membrane. They do not occur in all people with Wilson's disease. Wilson's disease is also associated with sunflower cataracts exhibited by brown or green pigmentation of the anterior and posterior lens capsule. Neither cause significant visual loss. KF rings occur in approximately 66% of diagnosed cases (more often in those with neurological symptoms rather than with liver problems).|$|E
5|$|For example, in {{the common}} {{cuttlefish}} the display consists of flattening the body, making the skin pale, showing a pair of eyespots on the mantle, dark eye rings, and a dark line on the fins, and dilating the pupils <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes.</b> The common octopus similarly displays pale skin and dark eye rings with dilated pupils, but also curls its arms and stretches out the web between the arms as far as possible, and squirts out jets of water. Other octopuses such as Atlantic white-spotted octopus turn bright brownish red with oval white spots all over in a high contrast display. The paper nautilus can rapidly change its appearance: it suddenly withdraws the shining iridescent web formed by its first pair of arms from its shell.|$|E

5|$|Many {{types of}} tear gas and other riot control agents have been {{produced}} with effects ranging from mild tearing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> to immediate vomiting and prostration. CN and CS are {{the most widely used}} and known, but around 15 different types {{of tear gas}} have been developed worldwide e.g. adamsite or bromoacetone, CNB, and CNC. CS has become the most popular due to its strong effect. The effect of CS on a person will depend on whether it is packaged as a solution or used as an aerosol. The size of solution droplets {{and the size of the}} CS particulates after evaporation are factors determining its effect on the human body.|$|E
5|$|More {{than a dozen}} {{peptides}} {{and other}} substances have been isolated from the Gila monster's venom, including hyaluronidase, serotonin, phospholipase A2, and several kallikrein-like glycoproteins responsible for the pain and edema caused by a bite. Four potentially lethal toxins have been isolated from the Gila monster's venom, including horridum venom, which causes hemorrhage in internal organs and exophthalmos (bulging <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes),</b> and helothermine, which causes lethargy, partial paralysis of the limbs, and hypothermia in rats. Most are similar in form to vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), which relaxes smooth muscle and regulates water and electrolyte secretion between the small and large intestines. These bioactive peptides are able to bind to VIP receptors in many different human tissues. One of these, helodermin, {{has been shown to}} inhibit the growth of lung cancer.|$|E
5|$|The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{warned in}} 2014 that {{over-the-counter}} acne products containing benzoyl peroxide and/or salicylic acid, including Proactiv, can cause severe irritation, {{as well as}} rare but life-threatening allergic reactions. Consumers were advised to stop using the products if they experience hives or itching, and to seek emergency medical attention if they feel faint, or experience throat tightness, breathing problems, or swelling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> face, lips or tongue. The FDA noted that it remains unclear whether the reactions are caused by the active ingredients, inactive ingredients or a combination.|$|E
