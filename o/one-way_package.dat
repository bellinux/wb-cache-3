40|$|Purpose of {{this paper}} The purpose {{of this paper}} is to develop an {{evaluation}} model comparing a one-way with a returnable packaging system from a supply chain perspective. Design/methodology/approach A theoretical evaluation model for comparing cost efficiency and environmental impact of <b>one-way</b> and returnable <b>packaging</b> systems in supply chains is developed from literature. The deducted model is subsequently tested in a case study of a supply chain involving Volvo Car Corporation and Volvo Logistics Corporation, comparing the use of a newly developed <b>one-way</b> <b>packaging</b> with the sustainability of a returnable packaging. Findings The developed theoretical model showed to be useful to compare the environmental and economic impact of two different packaging systems in a specific supply chain. The criteria used in the model are 1) packaging efficiency, 2) packaging material, 3) transport, 4) material handling, 5) waste, recycling and reuse, and 6) administration. In the case study, the <b>one-way</b> <b>packaging</b> resulted in less economic and environmental impact, indicating the importance for companies to question their packaging systems. Research limitations/implications The model only has been tested on one component in a case study. The model provides comparative, but not absolute, figures. Practical implications Managers can use the packaging evaluation model to compare different packaging systems for a component and determine the most sustainable packaging from an environmental and economic perspective. The case study indicated that the returnable packaging system commonly used in the automotive industry is not always preferable in terms of sustainability.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to develop an {{evaluation}} model for the selection of packaging systems in supply chains from a sustainability perspective. A theoretical evaluation model for comparing cost efficiency and the environmental impact of packaging systems in supply chains are developed from literature. The model is tested in a case study of a supply chain involving Volvo Car Corporation and Volvo Logistics Corporation, comparing the use of newly developed, <b>one-way</b> <b>packaging</b> with the sustainability of returnable packaging. The model compares the environmental and economic impacts of two packaging systems in a specific supply chain. The criteria used in the model are (i) packaging fill rate, (ii) packaging material, (iii) transport, (iv) material handling, (v) waste handling and (vi) administration. In the case study, the <b>one-way</b> <b>packaging</b> resulted in fewer economic and environmental impacts, thereby indicating the importance for companies to question their packaging systems. The model has been tested on one component in a case study. It provides a comparison of the packaging choices included using comparative, but not absolute, figures for the economic and environmental impacts. Managers can use the model to compare packaging systems for component supply and determine the most sustainable packaging from environmental and economic perspectives. The case study indicated that the returnable packaging system commonly used in the automotive industry is not always preferable in terms of sustainability. The article fulfils the need to evaluate the impact of packaging systems on supply chain sustainability in terms of economic and environmental criteria. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
30|$|In {{transforming}} traditional distribution systems {{into more}} environmentally friendly ones, the transportation {{equipment and the}} packaging materials used are of major importance. More than a decade ago, Hekkert et al. [23] hypothesized that using reusable instead of <b>one-way</b> <b>packaging</b> material {{has the potential to}} reduce global CO 2 emissions from production and transportation by up to 16  %. Other studies suggested that employing reusable packaging material may reduce the gross energy requirement and waste generation of transportation significantly [39]. So-called returnable transport items (RTIs), which represent a specific type of reusable packaging material, such as pallets, crates, railcars or (maritime) containers, are used in a variety of industries today, e.g., in the automotive or consumer goods industries or the grocery sector [19, 29, 44, 46, 47].|$|R
40|$|One {{solution}} to avoid waste is the cyclic structure of material flows. The aim {{is on the}} one hand to reduce the quantity of materials which are fed into the economic system. On the other hand, those material flows which become waste should occur later by leading them into a cyclic flow. The structural change towards a closed-loop economy can be proceeded by a pool system in the field of packaging. A case study shows an example in the chemical industry to optimize logistic structures, cut costs and aim at ecological targets. As a result of this study the non-reusable packaging of foil rolls could be replaced by a reusable metal rack and <b>one-way</b> <b>packaging</b> material could be reduced from 100 kg to only 1 kg of foils for the packaging of 1 t of magnetic tape foils. Costs for packaging material, packing processes and waste disposal could be saved. Thanks to shown cost structures customers could be persuaded to integrate this system into their logistic structure and thus to take over necessar y logistic functions...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study for {{analysing}} costs affected by packaging in a producing industry. The purpose {{is to develop a}} model that will calculate and present possible cost savings for the customer by using Volvo Logistics Corporations, VLC’s, returnable packaging instead of other packaging solutions. The thesis is based on qualitative data gained from both theoretical and empirical studies. The methodology for gaining information has been to study theoretical sources such as course literature and articles, as well as through interviews and consolidation with staff at Volvo Logistics Corporations office in Gothenburg. The model is constructed in Microsoft Excel and consists of six different sheets. The first sheet is a front page that summarises the costs calculated in the other sheets and presents the possible cost savings. After the front page there are three sheets with calculations for the costs in different scenarios, Today’s Situation, VLC Packaging Solution (Pre implementation) and VLC Packaging Solution (Post implementation). The first sheet, Today’s Situation, presents the result of the model that will calculate the customers’ current costs that are associated with packaging. The different costs presented in the model are costs for unloading, repacking, today’s cost for an internal packaging solution, quality related costs, <b>one-way</b> <b>packaging</b> costs and the costs for other packaging solutions. The next sheet, VLC Packaging Solution (Pre), presents an estimation of the cost for thecustomer when using VLC’s returnable packaging system. The estimation will serve as an investment tool, for calculating possible cost savings compared to the present situation. The different costs that will be discussed are handling costs, quality related costs, distribution cost, transaction cost, and investment cost. The third and final calculation sheet, VLC Packaging Solution (Post), presents the actual costs for the customer after the implementation. When the costs have been calculated they will be used to evaluate the actual cost savings for the customer. The last two sheets are a data sheet, which consists of data needed for the calculations in the previous sheets, and an instruction sheet where there are instructions to the different calculations in the model. The conclusion shows that the objective to create a model for calculating the costs for different packaging systems and present possible cost savings is fulfilled...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to propose}} an integrated method, which combines all the aspects required to reduce environmental impact from waste packaging {{and to increase}} knowledge on {{the best way to}} enhance reusable packaging. Through a review of the extant literature, a conceptual framework was designed of the most important dimensions to enhance reusable packaging amongst society and industries The main contributions in the research are the development of a Social Behaviour Aspect Model (SBAM) and the creation of reusable packaging attributes checklist. The SBAM can help industries focus on having high knowledge about reuse of packaging and to cooperate with communities to develop personal and social values and norms during the designing of reusable packaging. SBAM is the output from the first phase, which showed the importance of making an effort to develop packaging for consumers to reuse. The reusable packaging attributes checklist can provide a guideline for manufacturers/designers who intend to develop packaging sustainability performance through designing reusable packaging, and contribute to meet and interpret the reuse of packaging requirements and procedures. It also determines the environmental impact of reusable packaging attributes, which many industries are concerned about. The reusable packaging attributes checklist is the output from the second and third phases. The System Dynamic (SD) method was the approach used to determinate the interaction between social aspects and reusable packaging. The Normal Average, Codes and Coding and factor analysis with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) approaches were used to determine the reusable packaging attributes checklist. The last phase of the research was the conduction of a case study of a real company which needs {{to increase the amount of}} reusable packaging it uses and which seeks to reduce its environmental impact. All methods used in this research have both a quantitative and a qualitative nature. Data was collected by evaluation of consumers' responses and experts' experiences, as provided in the questionnaires. This research opens up opportunities for improving packaging and meeting sustainable profits and provides valuable information based on social, economic and environmental benefits of reusable packaging. The novelty of this research can help industries to investigate the most important areas for development within communities to enhance the use of reusable packaging and also facilitate the process-based change from <b>one-way</b> <b>packaging</b> to reusable packaging effectively with reduction of environmental impact...|$|R
40|$|The {{mandatory}} deposit for <b>one-way</b> drinks <b>packaging,</b> {{embodied in}} the German Packaging Ordinance of 1991, entered into force in January 2003, after the condition for its implementation was given {{by the fall of}} the market share of reusable drinks packaging under 72 % in 1997. In this context the author doubts that the German mandatory deposit is an effective instrument to stabilise the market share of ecologically advantageous drinks packaging. Rather it is to be expected that the environmental policy objectives can be accomplished more effectively by a reorientation of the specific environmental policy. Hence it needs to be considered that – even eleven years after the first time decrease of the relevant market share of reusable drinks packaging – an urgent need for action exists in Germany. This practise based analysis therefore deals with packaging-taxes as an alternative environmental policy instrument and points out recommendations against the background of a further amending of the German Packaging Ordinance as well as experiences from the use of packaging taxes in Europe. agri-environmental policy, biodiversity conservation auctions, transaction costs, ecological services, plant biodiversity, experimental economics, EAFRD-Regulation...|$|R

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} identify the annual changes in hair follicle activity, changes at the follicular level and to characterize some of the fibre-follicle characteristics of camels at different ages. A total of 28 camels were allocated at random {{on the basis of}} age to one of four groups (2, 4, 6 and older than 8 years). All groups of camels were fed a maintenance level of ration throughout the experiment. To determine hair follicle cycle and other follicle characteristics samples of skin were taken using a trephine from the right midside of animals at approximately 28 day intervals for a period of 12 months. Using a small hand clipper, 15 g of fibre sample was taken from the left midside region to determine fibre characteristics. Analysis of variance was performed using a <b>one-way</b> SAS <b>package</b> and the means and the standard deviations of means were generated with this program. Mean S/P ratio, primary and secondary and total follicle densities of all groups of camels were 6. 85 ± 0. 75, 3. 76 ± 0. 63, 22. 29 ± 3. 57 and 25. 33 ± 3. 85, respectively. Mean fibre diameter, percentage of medullated and non-medullated fibre and clean wool percentage of all groups were 18. 98 ± 1. 64, 18. 10 ± 1. 65, 81. 89 ± 6. 98 and 77. 58 ± 4. 58, respectively. Mean percentage of active primary follicles significantly (p< 0. 05) decreased to lowest in February to a minimum of 83. 1 %, then significantly (p< 0. 05) increased over spring.

40|$|The {{project was}} formed from three basic observations, which {{together}} considerably alter the requirements when designing the supply chains. First, the lean production deployment is now ruling {{the design of}} the work cells, e. g. the assembly stations. Second, the focus on sustainability and environmental consideration is calling for new models when designing the supply chains, and third, great cost and time reduction potentials are revealed in the supply chains when applying value stream mapping. The purpose of the project was to contribute to the understanding and to the methods of how to design and evaluate sustainable and cost efficient supply chains that supports lean production processes. The project involved all industrial actors of the FFI programme and relied to a large extent on case studies performed in the companies. These cases often combined the development of models and methods with testing and pilot implementations at the companies. Results were disseminated among the actors through workshops and seminars, which further strengthened the results and understanding of applicability. Among the theoretical contributions is the development of the concept of material exposure, as an interface between materials supply and assembly. This interface realizes the product of the material supply system {{in the form of an}} available component for the assembly system to assemble, given the requirements of the customer in form of the assembly system. These requirements govern how material exposure is realized and provides a framework for how materials supply systems can be designed. In this way, the principles of lean production in the assembly is supported by the material supply, while allowing the development of a material supply system that itself is lean. One case study investigated systems for repacking of material between packaging types, that may be necessary to meet the requirements of the assembly system at the same time as the transport costs are kept down. From the case study, a classification of compo¬nents that can be handled manually in this type of repacking were derived, and five different types of components were identified. The case study conclusions include the time to pick these components between different packaging types. These results have been put into further work in the case study company, regarding designing systems for repacking of material. A theoretical model was developed to compare how the choice of packaging affect cost and CO_ 2 emissions for the supply of materials. A case study chose to compare two different packages with fundamentally different characteristics, one of which was a conventional returnable packaging based on plastics and the other a disposable <b>one-way</b> <b>packaging.</b> In this case the disposable packaging turned out to be clearly advantageous from both a cost and an environmental perspective. A new methodology to describe and evaluate the fulfilment of requirements of material flows was developed within the sub-project ‘Materials Flow Mapping’. This methodol¬ogy provides the ability to better, and in more detail, study material flows and its activi¬ties. Such a level of detail in the analysis proved valuable as a basis for improvement work in the materials supply system, where there is a need to be able to describe the often non-value-added activities that occur. One sub-project was carried out with the aim of developing a cost model for estimating the cost of packaging, transport and in-plant logistics in a supply chain from suppliers to assembly, and to implement this in a software. This is an important contribution to the development of a decision tool for the selection of materials supply set up. The model represents a comparatively fast tool for obtaining cost estimates of various configura¬tions of the materials supply system. Finally, one sub-project has treated materials control, to support the research being done on the physical flows. The focus has been on pull-based materials planning with consid-eration to man, technology and organization (MTO), a need that was identified during the project. The result is two-fold, the first part being a model consisting of MTO factors that are important to take into account in the design and implementation phase of a pull-based system. Secondly, research has provided a better understanding of the potential problems during a process of implementing an external pull system and classified these problems based on the MTO dimensions...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the slot angulations of Roth prescription preadjusted metallic brackets for the maxillary left central incisor and maxillary left canine. For each tooth type, 10 brackets of three commercial brands (GAC, Forestadent and Morelli) were selected.

Although MR-compatible electrodes are now commercially available, MR-guided RF ablation requires implementation {{of a number of}} hardware and software modifications that are not included in all current diagnostic MR units. Hardware requirements include an in-room monitor and user interface, adequate surface coils, a RF generator with filtered frequencies and special connecting cables leading into the Faraday cage, and MR-compatible <b>one-way</b> material. Software <b>packages</b> should include dedicated rapid “fluoroscopic” 3 D-sequences with T 1 - or T 2 -weighting and obtained in two orthogonal oblique planes, in order to allow near real-time visual feedback of the progression of the RF electrode(s) during the targeting procedure. With some experience, the procedure time may be limited to less than an hour. MR-based colour-coded mapping of temperature and energy deposition is technically feasible. However, it is hampered by the susceptibility artefacts generated by the RF electrode and by motion artefacts, and the clinical usefulness of this form of monitoring has yet to be proven. Signal loss on T 2 -weighted images and on contrast-enhanced T 1 -weighted images may be used to evaluate the ablation zone with MR imaging immediately after treatment.
