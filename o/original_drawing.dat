5|$|There {{was limited}} {{interference}} from Orion Pictures. Two suggestions Orion put forward included {{the addition of}} a canine android for Reese, which Cameron refused, and to strengthen the love interest between Sarah and Reese, which Cameron accepted. To create the Terminator's look, Winston and Cameron passed sketches back and forth, eventually deciding on a design nearly identical to Cameron's <b>original</b> <b>drawing</b> in Rome. Winston had a team of seven artists work for six months to create a Terminator puppet; it was first molded in clay, then plaster reinforced with steel ribbing. These pieces were then sanded, painted and then chrome-plated. Winston sculpted a reproduction of Schwarzenegger's face in several poses out of silicone, clay and plaster.|$|E
5|$|After much persuasion, he overcame {{his fear}} and {{eventually}} made three trips to Singapore to restore his murals in December 1963, July 1982 and May 1988. The 1982 restoration was more intensive and the invaluable assistance given to Warren by {{the officers and}} boys of the SAF Boys' School enabled {{the bulk of the}} work to be completed. Of the original five murals, only one was not fully restored; the mural of St Luke in Prison. Stanley's original tracing of the drawing was missing, and he could not remember the details of the missing portion. In 1985, Stanley's <b>original</b> <b>drawing</b> was discovered in the memorabilia of Wally Hammond who had been a fellow prisoner with Stanley. These original sketches were subsequently donated to the National Archives of Singapore. From the original, Stanley painted a small picture, which was placed below the remaining piece of the mural in 1988. He was, by then, not fit enough to restore the actual mural.|$|E

25|$|A monumental statue {{for the top}} of the {{national}} Capitol appeared in architect Thomas U. Walter's <b>original</b> <b>drawing</b> for the new cast-iron dome, which was authorized in 1855. Walter's drawing showed the outline of a statue representing the Goddess of Liberty; Crawford proposed instead an allegorical figure of Freedom Triumphant in War and Peace.|$|E
25|$|The next {{definitive}} series, the Liberty Issue, featured Lincoln on its 4¢ stamp, {{released on}} November 16, 1954. This issue paid the 1st class mail rate until 1963. Designed by Charles R. Chickering, the design was modeled after by an <b>original</b> <b>drawing</b> from {{a photograph of}} a Douglas Volk portrait. During its use it was considered the most popular postage stamp in the United States.|$|E
25|$|George Washington {{was honored}} on the 1-cent Liberty Issue 1954-1968 on August 26, 1954. Charles R.

25|$|Ezima {{was filmed}} by the FBI while meeting with agent Sebold in New York, {{conclusive}} evidence of German-Japanese cooperation in espionage, {{in addition to}} meeting with Kanegoro Koike, Paymaster Commander of the Japanese Imperial Navy assigned to the Office of the Japanese Naval Inspector in New York. Ezima obtained a number of military materials from Duquesne, including ammunition, a drawing of a hydraulic unit with pressure switch A-5 of the Sperry Gyroscope, and an <b>original</b> <b>drawing</b> from the Lawrence Engineering and Research Corporation of a soundproofing installation, and he agreed to deliver materials to Germany via Japan. The British had made the Abwehr courier route from New York through Lisbon, Portugal difficult, so Ezima arranged an alternate route to the West Coast with deliveries every two weeks on freighters destined for Japan.|$|E
500|$|In December 2008 the Hereford Times {{reported}} that the college would be home to a sculpture by the Herefordshire-based contemporary artist Walenty Pytel that he would create using an <b>original</b> <b>drawing</b> produced by an RNC student.

500|$|Another popular print, The Wonderful Mrs Atkinson, was {{published}} anonymously in around 1815, {{based on an}} earlier drawing by George Morland. (Morland had died in 1804, so his drawing cannot {{have been inspired by}} the 1814–15 reports.) Morland's <b>original</b> <b>drawing</b> stated that the Pig-faced Lady was [...] "born in Ireland, has £20,000 fortune, and is fed out of a silver trough".

500|$|Ukiyo-e {{prints were}} {{impressed}} on hand-made paper manually, {{rather than by}} mechanical press as in the West. [...] The artist provided an ink drawing on thin paper, which was pasted to a block of cherry wood and rubbed with oil until the upper layers of paper could be pulled away, leaving a translucent layer of paper that the block-cutter could use as a guide. The block-cutter cut away the non-black areas of the image, leaving raised areas that were inked to leave an impression. [...] The <b>original</b> <b>drawing</b> was destroyed in the process.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the third}} season, Ward cautioned fans that, due to legal reasons, {{he was unable}} to accept fan creations for {{characters}} and stories. However, the sixteenth episode, [...] "Jake vs. Me-Mow" [...] features the titular character Me-Mow, which was drawn by Gunnar Gilmore, aged 14. Gilmore had sketched the character and showed his mother, who forwarded it to Cartoon Network. Ward decided to include the character solely because the character was [...] "so cute". Gilmore's <b>original</b> <b>drawing</b> was used for the episode's title card. So far, this appears to be the only fan-created character that Ward has allowed on the show.|$|E
500|$|Davenport {{returned}} to San Francisco and regained his {{position at the}} Chronicle. [...] This time, {{he was allowed to}} caricature California political figures. By then, William Randolph Hearst owned the Examiner. [...] In his early days as a newspaper tycoon, Hearst followed Davenport's cartoons in the Chronicle, and when the cartoonist became well known for his satires of figures in the 1894 California gubernatorial campaign, hired him, more than doubling his salary. When a famous horse died and the Examiner lacked an image, Davenport, who had seen the animal the previous year, drew it from memory. Impressed, Hearst purchased the <b>original</b> <b>drawing.</b> [...] Davenport took his responsibilities as political cartoonist seriously, traveling to Sacramento, the state capital, to observe the legislative process and its participants.|$|E
50|$|The <b>original</b> <b>draw</b> had Kuwait in {{the same}} group as Iraq. Kuwait protested {{that they did not}} want to be in Iraq's group due to {{political}} tensions, so the AFC did a re-draw to separate Iraq and Kuwait.|$|R

500|$|The {{album cover}} for The Hunting Party {{features}} a 3D modeled artwork by Brandon Parvini, {{who had previously}} designed the artworks for Living Things and the band's singles during the album's release cycle. The artwork was based off an <b>original</b> <b>drawing,</b> entitled [...] "Archer", by visual artist James Jean that was created for the album. It {{is one of many}} artworks by Jean {{to be used in the}} packaging of the album, which also features, in deluxe editions of the album, a lithograph, T-shirt and a 36-page art book by him. Jean's traditional style, notably different to the artwork created for The Hunting Party had been previously described by Dana Jennings of The New York Times as [...] "suffused with a dreamy romanticism and lyricism worthy of Maxfield Parrish, even as Mr. Jean subverts those and other isms." ...|$|E
500|$|The Hunting Party is a {{departure}} from the electronic rock sound of the band's previous two studio albums, A Thousand Suns (2010) and Living Things (2012). The album, described by Shinoda as simply [...] "a rock record", serves a statement by the band against contemporary mainstream and active rock bands, accused by him as [...] "trying to be other bands and playing it safe". Packaged by an artwork by Brandon Parvini based on an <b>original</b> <b>drawing</b> by James Jean, the album took under a year to record and produce, with material being improvisationally written by the band. The album also features guest appearances from Page Hamilton of Helmet, Daron Malakian of System of a Down, Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine, and Rakim, marking the first time Linkin Park has collaborated with other artists on a studio album.|$|E
500|$|... "Mortal Folly" [...] and [...] "Mortal Recoil" [...] {{feature the}} first {{substantial}} {{appearance of the}} Lich, the series' primary antagonist, who made an early appearance in the season one episode [...] "His Hero" [...] being defeated by Billy in a flashback. The Lich had appeared in concept drawings in the series' pitch bible, which Ward himself had created in 2007. Ward's <b>original</b> <b>drawing</b> was re-designed by former creative director McHale; he purposely gave the Lich a desiccated and dried-up look, and was instrumental in crafting the Lich's rotting appearance. In both this episode and other episodes where the character appears, the Lich was voiced by Ron Perlman. The snail, an easter egg that appears in every episode, appears in the episodes and plays a prominent part. Originally, the snail {{was inspired by the}} in-jokes in episodes of The Simpsons, and was Ward's attempt to [...] "make a game out of every episode of Adventure Time, where you could freeze-frame and find things in the background", such as the snail. However, in [...] "Mortal Folly", the snail serves as the catalyst for the Lich's escape. The snail would also play an important part in other mythology-heavy episodes like [...] "In Your Footsteps", and [...] "The Lich". Osborne later noted that the snail's appearance was pleasing to fans who knew that the snail had been appearing in all the episodes and had actively searched for it before.|$|E

50|$|Angelique Kerber {{received}} a wildcard after the <b>original</b> <b>draw</b> was made.

500|$|Evans' process {{involved}} {{a number of}} steps. First, the line drawing of an illustration was photographed and printed onto block while the line drawing was engraved. Proofs of the key block were coloured by the illustrator; Evans would then [...] "determine the sequencing and register...to arrive at a close reproduction of the artist's original". Blocks were painted and engraved; one for each colour. A proof of each colour block was made before a final proof from the key block. [...] Ideally, the proof would be a faithful reproduction of the <b>original</b> <b>drawing,</b> but Evans believed a print was never {{as good as a}} drawing. He took care to grind and mix his inks so they closely emulated the original. Finally, each block was placed so as to allow the individual colours to print on the page exactly as intended. Aware of costs and printing efficiencies, he used as few colours as possible. Illustrations were produced with a base of black, along with one or two colours and a flesh tone for faces and hands. In some cases, Evans may have used as few as four colour blocks: likely black, flesh and two primary colours; the addition of yellow allowed him a greater range. Each colour was printed from a separately engraved block; there were often between five or ten blocks. The chief problem was to maintain correct register, achieved by placing small holes in precise positions on each block to which the paper was pinned. If done correctly, the register of colours match, although sometimes ink squash is visible along the edges of an illustration.|$|E
2500|$|Cohen {{designed}} one of {{the robots}} in the robot strip club which he said was [...] "his one artistic contribution to the show". The robot's waist gyrated sexily using a planetary gear. In an episode's commentary, this artistic contribution is discussed by Futurama co-creator Matt Groening, who describes Cohen as being very particular about how the animators used his design, and that Cohen's <b>original</b> <b>drawing</b> is still framed in his office.|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, Billy Ireland Cartoon Library & Museum at Ohio State University mounted an {{exhibition}} of Watterson's Sunday strips. He chose thirty-six of his favorites, displaying them with both the <b>original</b> <b>drawing</b> and the colored finished product, with most pieces featuring personal annotations. Watterson also wrote an accompanying essay {{that served as the}} foreword for the exhibit, called [...] "Calvin and Hobbes: Sunday Pages 1985–1995". which opened on September 10, 2001. It was taken down in January 2002. [...] The accompanying published catalog had the same title.|$|E
