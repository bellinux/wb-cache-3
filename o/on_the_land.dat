5|$|In 1908, the Limestone Plains area, {{including}} Yarralumla, {{was selected}} as the site for the capital city of the newly established Commonwealth of Australia. Soon afterwards in 1913, the Commonwealth Government purchased the property. Tenant farmers were allowed to stay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> on annual leases, some remaining until 1963 when the Molonglo River was dammed to form Lake Burley Griffin.|$|E
5|$|In the 9th century some principalities arose on the {{territory}} of modern Belarus. Among them was the Principality of Polatsk that {{for most of the}} time was effectively an independent State (apart from about 20 years when it was a Vassal of Kievan Rus'). The Principality of Polatsk was the first nation state to be established <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> of Belarus.|$|E
50|$|The {{municipality}} has 37 protected areas, including Kuklite ("The Dolls") {{rock formations}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lands</b> of Resselets village; Kaleto tectonic ridge <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lands</b> of Reselets village; Skoka waterfall <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lands</b> of Reselets; Haydoushka cave near Deventsi; Sedlarkata Rock Bridge <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lands</b> of Rakita; Neolithic settlements near Telish, Thracian settlements in Chomakovtsi, Roman cites near Resselets and Chomakovtsi.|$|R

5|$|South Dakota's early economy {{relied heavily}} on the soil, {{minerals}} and ecology of the area, as {{nearly all of the}} earliest white settlers in the area were farmers, miners, or trappers. Although other economic sectors have risen in prominence in recent years, early dependence <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> laid the foundation for the future economic activity of the state.|$|E
5|$|Where armour is not {{required}} or mobility and speed are favoured the British Army utilises protected patrol vehicles, such as the Panther variant of the Iveco LMV, and variants of the Cougar family (such as the Foxhound, Ridgeback, Husky and Mastiff). For day-to-day utility work the army commonly uses the Land Rover Wolf, which is based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> Rover Defender.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the expiry of the lease <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>land,</b> Penshurst Airfield closed on 28 July 1936. Air Travel Ltd moved to Gatwick. In 1938, the land was {{converted}} for use as a Polo ground by the Eridge Polo Club. Civil aircraft that were based at Penshurst include the Avro Avian III, Avro Avian IVM, Avro 504K and Avro 504N, de Havilland DH.60 Moth (various models), and Spartan Three-Seater.|$|E

5|$|Before 1952, {{the entire}} State of Florida {{was under the}} {{jurisdiction}} of one diocese, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Saint Augustine. In the 1950s and early 1960s, Saint Augustine bishop Joseph Patrick Hurley purchased land throughout South Florida in anticipation of a future population boom. Today, these once remote areas are thriving cities. Dozens of Catholic churches, schools and cemeteries built <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> purchased by Hurley dot these areas.|$|E
5|$|Charles I of Naples {{signed an}} {{alliance}} with Split and Šibenik against Omiš pirates in June and September 1274. The citizens of Omiš responded by {{an alliance with}} Venice in August, in accordance with a 20-year peace treaty signed by knezes Radoš, Bogdan, Juraj and Semen. This triggered conflict <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> and sea in 1275. The activities in the intermediate years are unknown, besides that in April 1278 the islands of Hvar and Brač recognized Venetian authority, and the Omiš in 1281.|$|E
5|$|Communication {{with the}} outside world <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> side was {{maintained}} with the city through two main well-protected city gates, one placed on the western side {{of the city and the}} other placed on the eastern side. These entrances were constructed so that communications with the city could not be carried out directly; the messenger had to enter through multiple doors and walk down a winding passageway, which is evidence of the security measures taken as a last defense against the possibility of a surprise breach or entrance of unexpected visitors.|$|E

5|$|Hippo {{defecation}} creates allochthonous {{deposits of}} organic matter along the river beds. These deposits have an unclear ecological function. A 2015 study suggests that hippo dung provides nutrients from terrestrial material for fish and aquatic invertebrates. Because of their size and their habit of taking the same paths to feed, hippos can {{have a significant impact}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> across which they walk, both by keeping the land clear of vegetation and depressing the ground. Over prolonged periods, hippos can divert the paths of swamps and channels.|$|E
5|$|In 1879 Henry Colton, {{who worked}} for the Williamsport Lumber Company, {{supervised}} the cutting of white pine <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> owned by Silas Billings; this land would later become the park. Colton gave his name to the Colton Point overlook on the west rim of the Pine Creek Gorge. Deadman Hollow Road in the park is named for a trapper whose decomposed body was found in his own bear trap there in the early 20th century. Fourmile Run flows through the park: its O'Connor Branch is named for the dead trapper's brothers, who were loggers in the area.|$|E
5|$|In Anglo-Saxon society, noblewomen enjoyed {{considerable}} {{rights and}} status, although the society was still firmly patriarchal. Some exercised power as abbesses, exerting widespread influence across the early English Church, although their wealth and authority diminished with the monastic {{reforms of the}} 9th century. Anglo-Saxon queens began to hold lands {{in their own right}} in the 10th century and their households contributed to the running of the kingdom. Although women could not lead military forces, in the absence of their husbands some noblewomen led the defence of manors and towns. Most Anglo-Saxon women, however, worked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> as part of the agricultural community, or as brewers or bakers.|$|E

5|$|In the 13th century, Newcastle upon Tyne had a {{population}} of around 4,000; and {{it was difficult for}} the four parish churches to care for the needs of such a large population. The priests were expected to be educators, doctors and counsellors, as well as meeting the spiritual needs of their parishioners. Therefore, in 1291 land was donated by William Baron of Wark on Tweed to found an Augustinian friary <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> on which the museum now stands.|$|E
5|$|Landlords {{generally}} divided their estates {{into smaller}} farms that they rented to tenant farmers. Tenant farmers were generally on one-year leases, {{and could be}} evicted even if they paid their rents. Some of the tenants were large farmers who farmed over , but the majority were much smaller—on average between 15 and 50 acres (0.06–0.20km2). Many small farmers worked as labourers on the larger farms. The poorest agricultural workers were the landless labourers, who worked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> of other farmers. Farmers were an important group politically, having more votes than any other sector of society.|$|E

5|$|Melting of {{floating}} ice shelves (ice that originated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>land)</b> {{does not in}} itself contribute much to sea-level rise (since the ice displaces only its own mass of water). However it is the outflow of the ice from the land to form the ice shelf which causes a rise in global sea level. This effect is offset by snow falling back onto the continent. Recent decades have witnessed several dramatic collapses of large ice shelves around the coast of Antarctica, especially along the Antarctic Peninsula. Concerns have been raised that disruption of ice shelves may result in increased glacial outflow from the continental ice mass.|$|E
5|$|Nearing {{the end of}} {{his term}} in office Clarke decided not to run for {{re-election}} in 1883. He was losing too much support due to his ties with the Hudson's Bay Company. The electorate suspected him of working under the influence of his office to locate important government offices <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> owned by the company. Two completely new candidates ran in the 1883 election, Captain Day Hort MacDowall and Dr. Andrew Everett Porter.|$|E
5|$|On May 13, 1851, Antoine-Olivier Berthelet {{purchased}} land on {{the corner}} of Dorchester Boulevard and Saint-André Street (in Montreal) for use by the Misericorde Sisters, and in December 1851, following renovations to the two pre-existing structures <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>land,</b> the Sisters moved to the new address. In 1853 work began on a Mother House (or convent) for the Institute. The Motherhouse was planned to be a multistory building, built of grey stone, financed by borrowed money. Plans for the motherhouse had been drawn up in 1852 but the Montreal fires of July 8, 1852, which destroyed around 11,000 homes along with the Saint-Jacques Cathedral, had the result of delaying construction projects throughout the city.|$|E
