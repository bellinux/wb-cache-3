5|$|Danish country vicarages {{from this}} period tended {{to be built in}} the same style as farmhouses, though usually rather larger. A fine example is Kølstrup Vicarage near Kerteminde in {{north-eastern}} Funen. The house itself is a thatched half-timbered building with a large rectangular courtyard flanked by <b>outhouses.</b>|$|E
5|$|Outside urban areas, the redback is {{more often}} found in drier {{habitats}} ranging from sclerophyll forest to desert, even as harsh as the Simpson Desert. It became much more common in urban areas {{in the early decades}} of the 20th century, and is now found in all but the most inhospitable environments in Australia and its cities. It is particularly common in Brisbane, Perth and Alice Springs. The redback spider is commonly found in close proximity to human residences. Webs are usually built in dry, dark, sheltered sites, such as among rocks, in logs, tree hollows, shrubs, old tyres, sheds, <b>outhouses,</b> empty tins and boxes, children's toys or under rubbish or litter. Letterboxes and the undersurface of toilet seats are common sites. Populations can be controlled by clearing these habitats, squashing the spiders and their egg sacs, and using pesticide in <b>outhouses.</b> The CSIRO Division of Entomology recommends against the use of spider pesticides due to their toxicity, and because redbacks are rapid recolonists anyway.|$|E

5|$|The {{only other}} {{buildings}} on the site are two <b>outhouses,</b> located {{to the rear of}} the school building. Both are non-functional, display models. One outhouse is an original 1870s structure, transported to the site and reassembled. The other outhouse is a copy, built from salvaged materials during the school restoration. Neither outhouse is historically associated with Chana School and both are considered non-contributing factors in the schoolhouse's National Register of Historic Places listing.|$|E
5|$|Building {{practices}} {{along the}} coast also included boathouses, fishing cottages, piers, etc. Here, houses for livestock and people were typically built up from the actual shoreline. A typical medium-sized farm in the inland of Norway would include a dwelling house (våningshus), hay barn (låve), livestock barn (fjøs), one or more food storage houses (stabbur), a stable, and occasionally separate houses for poultry, pigs, etc. Houses that had separate heat sources, e.g., washing houses (eldhus) and smithies were usually kept separate from the other houses to prevent fires. <b>Outhouses</b> were typically separate, small structures. If the farm housed craftsmen, there would also be separate houses for carpentry, wheel making, shoemaking, etc.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1812, maps of the {{peninsula}} showed a marked increase in buildings: a two-story common prison, a small hospital, officers' quarters, a gunner's house, a turnkey store, fuel sheds, the agent's office and guard house, a bell house, nine sentry boxes, and four oceanside <b>outhouses.</b> Despite this, the facility was severely overcrowded, a problem compounded by attempts at segregating the remaining French prisoners and the few African-Americans from the majority white American population. 2078 prisoners were recorded {{by the end of}} 1812, including 1412 privateers and 572 merchant seamen. More than 3000 arrived over the next two years, including nearly 1000 soldiers captured in the Niagara area.|$|E

The <b>Outhouse</b> Crew is made up of 6 sophomore cadets from The Fightin' Texas Aggie Band. A crewmember is chosen from each of the four band outfits and a head crewmember and grode crewmember are also chosen. The <b>outhouse</b> is built in a secret location before being unveiled in front of the Dixie Chicken on Northgate. From there the <b>outhouse</b> is taken to the bonfire stack where a Redpot rides it to the top as it is lifted by crane.|$|R

5|$|Camping is {{a popular}} pastime at Colton Point State Park; 1,989persons have used the camping {{facilities}} in 2003. With no modern amenities like flush toilets or showers, the campsites take on a rustic nature. There are <b>outhouses,</b> fire rings, a sanitary dump station and picnic tables at the campground. An Organized Group Tenting area, intended for organized youth or adult groups, can accommodate up to 90 campers. 1,490campers used the area in 2003. The park also has approximately 100 picnic tables and five CCC-built picnic shelters which can be reserved. These facilities were used by 15,379 picnickers in 2003.|$|E
5|$|A 2004 review {{reported}} 46% of bites occurring on distal extremities of the limbs, 25% on proximal {{areas of}} limbs (upper arms and thighs), 21% on the trunk, and 7% {{on the head}} or neck. In some cases the same spider bites a victim multiple times. Historically, victims were often bitten on the genitalia, though this phenomenon disappeared as <b>outhouses</b> were superseded by plumbed indoor toilets. Conversely, bites {{on the head and}} neck have increased with use of safety helmets and ear muffs. Precautions to avoid being bitten include wearing gloves and shoes while gardening, not leaving clothes on the floor, and shaking out gloves or shoes before putting them on. Also, children can be educated not to touch spiders.|$|E
5|$|Gale-force winds lashed the tidewater {{region of}} Virginia {{in what was}} {{considered}} the worst storm on the lower Chesapeake Bay since the 1821 Norfolk and Long Island hurricane. A ship called the Osceola lost its wheelhouse to the winds, while onshore, the storm razed crops and a few small structures such as barns and <b>outhouses.</b> Affecting {{many of the same}} areas as the July hurricane, the cyclone downed trees in and around Baltimore and caused street flooding in Washington, D.C., where a railroad bridge was swept away. The storm began to influence the weather at Philadelphia on the night of August 24. Strong winds out of the north and northeast at Philadelphia and Newark, New Jersey, suggest the center moved off the New Jersey coast and reemerged into the Atlantic. In addition to the gales, more than 3 in (75mm) of rain fell on Newark on August 25.|$|E

5|$|The {{hurricane}} of 1804 was {{the first}} since 1752 to strike Georgia with such strength. Damage to ships was considerable, especially offshore Georgia. Betsy was stripped of its freight and somewhat damaged, the Phoebe ran aground at Tybee Island, the Liberty perished with its crew killed, the Patsy nearly sank, and the Experiment capsized. At the time the hurricane struck, Aaron Burr, hiding from federal officials, was taking refuge at St. Simons Island on the property of John Couper, though was unable to return to Hampton due to deteriorating conditions. Upon {{the passage of the}} storm's eye, Burr fled back to the residence of Pierce Butler at Hampton. In an account of the hurricane, Burr recorded strong winds, which destroyed several <b>outhouses</b> and uprooted numerous trees at St. Simon's, with the storm later cracking windows, toppling chimneys, and flooding the house; in the town proper, he discovered many local roads were obstructed. Nineteen slaves owned by Butler drowned, while Couper suffered $100,000 (1804USD) in losses alone, with cabins housing over a hundred slaves destroyed. Many other local planters experienced similar difficulties. Seawater inundated and ruined several acres of cotton around the Horton House plantation at Jekyll Island, devaluing the year's harvest by 20percent; similar losses were endured by other rice, cotton, and corn farmers along the coast.|$|E
25|$|<b>Outhouses</b> were in use {{in cities}} of {{developed}} countries (e.g. Australia) well into {{the second half of}} the twentieth century. They are still common in rural areas and also in cities of developing countries. <b>Outhouses</b> that are covering pit latrines in densely populated areas can cause groundwater pollution.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the oldest}} pre-system sewage types are pit toilets, latrines, and <b>outhouses.</b> These are still used in many {{developing}} countries.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the <b>Outhouse,</b> venues such as Veterans of Foreign Wars Halls in Kansas City and the Lawrence Opera House (later called Liberty Hall) would host {{hardcore}} concerts. When {{several of}} the local venues closed, the <b>Outhouse</b> quickly became the place to see punk shows. Concerts at the <b>Outhouse</b> were very inexpensive, with the first shows costing $3, and with $8 being the high end in the early 1990s.|$|R

25|$|In pre-modern Denmark, people {{generally}} defecated on farmland or {{other places where}} the human waste could be collected as fertilizer. The Old Norse language had several terms for referring to <b>outhouses,</b> including garðhús (yard house), náð-/náða-hús (house of rest), and annat hús (the other house). In general, toilets were functionally non-existent in rural Denmark until the 18th century.|$|E
