30|$|Based on {{the latest}} conventional–unconventional oil and gas {{databases}} and relevant reports, the distribution features of global <b>tight</b> <b>oil</b> were analyzed. A classification scheme of <b>tight</b> <b>oil</b> plays is proposed based on developed <b>tight</b> <b>oil</b> fields. Effective <b>tight</b> <b>oil</b> plays are defined by considering the exploiting practices {{of the past few}} years. Currently, potential <b>tight</b> <b>oil</b> areas are mainly distributed in 137 sets of shale strata in 84 basins, especially South America, North America, Russia, and North Africa. Foreland, craton, and continental rift basins dominate. In craton basins, <b>tight</b> <b>oil</b> mainly occurs in Paleozoic strata, while in continental rift basins, <b>tight</b> <b>oil</b> occurs in Paleozoic–Cenozoic strata. <b>Tight</b> <b>oil</b> mainly accumulates in the Cretaceous, Early Jurassic, Late Devonian, and Miocene, which correspond very well to six sets of global-developed source rocks. Based on source–reservoir relationship, core data, and well-logging data, <b>tight</b> <b>oil</b> plays can be classified into eight types, above-source play, below-source play, beside-source play, in-source play, between-source play, in-source mud-dominated play, in-source mud-subordinated play, and interbedded-source play. Specifically, between-source, interbedded-source, and in-source mud-subordinated plays are major targets for global <b>tight</b> <b>oil</b> development with high production. In contrast, in-source mud-dominated and in-source plays are less satisfactory.|$|R

5000|$|Outside the United States and Canada, {{development}} of shale <b>oil</b> (<b>tight</b> oil) resources {{may be limited}} {{by the lack of}} available drilling rigs: 2/3 of the world's active drill rigs are in the US and Canada, and rigs elsewhere {{are less likely to be}} equipped for horizontal drilling.

The future energy mix might be based more on the exploitation of unconventional oil and gas (e.g., oil sands, shale <b>oil,</b> <b>tight</b> oil, shale gas), or more on the use of non-fossil energy sources, like renewable energy.|$|E

5000|$|Launched in 1971 the 5-speed, [...] double {{overhead}} cam twin cylinder Triumph Bandit delivered [...] and could reach 110 mph. Essentially the same motorcycle as the BSA Fury, the Bandit represented the factory's last attempt {{to compete against}} Japanese imports.The only contemporary road test was by American magazine Cycle Guide in their March 1971 issue upon {{a visit to the}} Triumph and BSA factories at Meriden and Small Heath, respectively. The Bandit's petrol tank colour scheme was Cypress Green (although Cycle World identified it as Jealous Green [...] ) with white-lined black scallops above and below a metal Triumph badge with a chrome styling strip running down the top of the tank. The same paint scheme applied to the mudguards with a white-lined black stripe running down through their centre. The side panels were silver painted with black 'tombstone' style lettering stating the model name and engine size: 'Bandit 350'. The engine was all-alloy as opposed to Triumph's other twins that relied upon an iron barrel and considered by Cycle Guide to be 'beautifully finished' and 'a real thing of beauty'. Cycle Guide criticised the retention of a traditionally Triumph vertically split crankcase halves rather than adopting the Japanese practice of horizontally splitting them. Despite this, it was noted that the engine was <b>oil</b> <b>tight.</b> The small diameter instruments and foot pegs thought mounted too far forward came in for criticism as did the poor conical hub rear brake performance, unlike the 'great' front brake. Lever travel between gears was felt to be too long although the clutch operation was 'silky smooth'. The electrical system was twin coil and 12 volt and an electric starter was offered as an option. Carburetion was by two Amal 27mm carburetors. Cycle Guide were disappointed that the engine could not be expanded beyond 350cc but praised the engine's and exhausts' quietness. Two exhaust systems, a low level ('T35R') and high level (the 'T35SS' Street Scrambler version), were offered, the former offering more top speed. The low level exhaust system was finished in bright chrome, the high level system in matt black with a stainless steel heat shield. The T35SS version also came with what the brochure described as 'detachable electrics'. Tyres for both versions were the same, Dunlop K70; 3.25 x 18 inches for the front and 3.50 x 18 inches for the rear. Compression ratio was also the same for both : 9.5:1.|$|E
30|$|The {{mechanisms}} of hydrocarbon accumulation, microscopic pore structure, seepage mechanics of <b>tight</b> <b>oil</b> reservoir {{have been studied}} intensively abroad, lot of laboratories carried out displacement experiments with tight core, {{the results showed that}} miscible displacement of CO 2 puff and huff could get relatively higher recovery efficiency. In addition, the technology of <b>tight</b> <b>oil</b> exploration such as 3 D seismic interpretation, massive hydraulic fracturing, jet pump have been applied widely on tight reservoirs. With the technical supports, commercial exploration of <b>tight</b> <b>oil</b> has come true in North America (Tong 2007). In 2012, the <b>tight</b> <b>oil</b> production reached 97  million tons in the United States, about 22 % of total oil production. The United States stopped the import of light crude in 2013, since the increasement of <b>tight</b> <b>oil</b> production exceeded prediction. The IEA (International Energy Agency of USA) forecasted that the <b>tight</b> <b>oil</b> production will reach 150  million tons, which is about one-third of total production, this will cause the USA shift from energy importer to energy exporter. The global production of <b>tight</b> <b>oil</b> will reach 250  million tons.
