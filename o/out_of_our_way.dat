5|$|Sir Boyle Roche, 1st Baronet (October 1736 – 5 June 1807) was an Irish politician. After a {{distinguished}} career in North America with the British Army, Roche {{became a member}} of the Irish House of Commons in 1775, generally acting in support of the viceregal government. He is better remembered for the language of his speeches than his politicsthey were riddled with mixed metaphors ("Mr Speaker, I smell a rat; I see him forming in the air and darkening the sky; but I'll nip him in the bud"), malapropisms and other unfortunate turns of phrase ("Why we should put ourselves <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> to do anything for posterity, for what has posterity ever done for us?"). Roche may have been Richard Brinsley Sheridan's model for Mrs Malaprop.|$|E

2500|$|Before reciting kiddush, the challah, {{which will}} be the next food item eaten in honor of the Shabbat or holiday, is first covered with a cloth. According to Halakha, the blessing over bread takes {{precedence}} to the blessing over wine. However, in the interests of beginning the meal with kiddush, the challah is covered to [...] "remove" [...] it from the table (some do not have the challah on the table at all during kiddush). Some interpret the covering of the challah allegorically, explaining that if we are supposed to go <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> to protect even an inanimate object (the bread) from being [...] "insulted" [...] (by the blessing over wine taking precedence), then certainly we must go <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> to display sensitivity toward the feelings of other people.|$|E

60|$|Then chance {{threw me}} {{into the arms of}} another and very {{different}} commercial traveller, as we pulled <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Utah on <b>our</b> <b>way</b> to Omaha via the Rockies. He travelled in biscuits, of which more anon, and Fate had smitten him very heavily, having at one stroke knocked all the beauty and joy <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his poor life. So he journeyed with a case of samples as one dazed, and his eyes took no pleasure in anything that he saw. In his despair he had withdrawn himself to his religion,--he was a Baptist,--and spoke of its consolation with the artless freedom that an American generally exhibits when he is talking about his most sacred private affairs. There was a desert beyond Utah, hot and barren as Mian Mir in May. The sun baked the car-roof, and the dust caked the windows, and through the dust and the glare the man with the biscuits bore witness to his creed, which seems to include one of the greatest miracles in the world--the immediate unforeseen, self-conscious redemption of the soul by means very similar to those which turned Paul to the straight path.|$|R

40|$|We have {{identified}} 274 M-type brown dwarfs in the Hubble Space Telescope 2 ̆ 7 s Wide Field Camera 3 pure parallel fields from the Brightest of Reionizing Galaxies (BoRG) survey for high-redshift galaxies. These are near-infrared observations with multiple lines <b>of</b> sight <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> Milky <b>Way.</b> Using these observed M-type brown dwarfs, we fitted a Galactic disc and halo {{model with a}} Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis. This model worked best with the scalelength of the disc fixed at h = 2. 6 kpc. For the scaleheight of the disc, we found z 0 = 0. 29 + 0. 02 − 0. 019 z 0 = 0. 29 − 0. 019 + 0. 02 kpc and for the central number density, ρ 0 = 0. 29 + 0. 20 − 0. 13 ρ 0 = 0. 29 − 0. 13 + 0. 20 # pc− 3. For the halo, we derived a flattening parameter κ = 0. 45 ± 0. 04 and a power-law index p = 2. 4 ± 0. 07. We found the fraction of M-type brown dwarfs in the local density that belong to the halo to be fh = 0. 0075 + 0. 0025 − 0. 0019 − 0. 0019 + 0. 0025. We found no correlation between subtype of M-dwarf and any model parameters. The total number of M-type brown dwarfs in the disc and halo {{was determined to be}} 58. 2 + 9. 81 − 6. 70 × 109 58. 2 − 6. 70 + 9. 81 × 109. We found an upper limit for the fraction of M-type brown dwarfs in the halo of 7 + 5 − 4 − 4 + 5 [*]per[*]cent.

40|$|Insofar {{as human}} beings try to “know” we must define concepts, objects, actions. We label, we {{distinguish}} between one concept and another, and in doing this, we make categories. Labels are categories. Our categories are imperfect. Our labels are always relative, defined by and dependent on that which they exclude. The boundaries <b>of</b> <b>our</b> terms, what “counts” as something or what {{is considered to be}} within a certain term, are always shifting. Our definitions change based on <b>our</b> method <b>of</b> analysis. For instance, the definition of “human” is different in different disciplines, like science, philosophy, sociology, economics, etc. Given their instability, categories can only be rough approximations of what we mean, and not always very good ones at that. To our detriment, we sometimes forget that they are approximations, and already laden with meaning of their own. Michel Foucault and other thinkers have pointed <b>out</b> that some <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> knowing, for example, the scientific method, have become synonymous with truth, objectivity or neutrality. When this happens, we cease to question those ways of knowing, and the questions within those ways of knowing. We forget that the kinds of questions we ask determine the kinds of answers we find. Then, when something that does not prove easily “knowable” or categorizable troubles <b>our</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> knowing, we call it trouble. Instead <b>of</b> remembering that <b>our</b> methods are imperfect, we think that the thing we want to know about is flawed, wrong or bad. This thesis is a reclamation of the flawed, the failed, the queer, a revaluation of it as something positive and productive. It is a reminder to be critical <b>of</b> <b>our</b> categories, and to rule them rather than be ruled by them. Categories are tools, not truth...|$|R
40|$|Prior to 1990, {{the only}} well known ideal-hereditary Kurosh-Amitsur {{radicals}} in {{the variety of}} zero-symmetric near-rings were the Jacobson type radicals Iv(N), where ∨∈{ 2, 3 } and the Brown-McCoy radical. In 1990, Booth, Groenewald and Veldsman introduced {{the concept of an}} equiprime near-ring which leads to an ideal-hereditary Kurosh-Amitsur radical in N∘. The concept of an equiprime near-ring generalizes the concept of a prime ring to near-rings. Although the search for more ideal-hereditary radicals of near-rings was apparently the original motivation for the introduction of equiprime near-rings, it became clear that these near-rings are interesting in their own right. It is our aim in this treatise to give an exposition of the many interesting properties of equiprime near-rings. We begin with a brief reminder of near-ring rudiments; giving basic definitions and elementary results which are necessary for understanding and development of subsequent chapters. With the basics <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the <b>way,</b> <b>our</b> main task begins with a consideration of equiprime, strongly and completely equiprime left ideals. It is noted that any zero-symmetric near-ring can be embedded in an equiprime near-ring. Moreover, the class of equiprime near-rings is shown to be hereditary. Open questions arising <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the study of equiprime near-rings are highlighted along the way. In Chapter 3 we consider well known examples of near-rings and determine when such near-rings are equiprime. This provides more insight into the nature of equiprime near-rings and is a fertile ground for the birth of examples and counterexamples which may be used to close or solve some open question within the literature. We also prove some results which generalize some results of Booth and Hall [10] and Veldsman [29]. These results have not been previously presented elsewhere to the best <b>of</b> <b>our</b> knowledge. vii In Chapter 4, the equiprime near-rings are shown to yield an ideal-hereditary radical in N∘. It is shown that a special radical theory can be built on the equiprime nearrings {{in much the same way}} prime rings are used in ring theory to define special radical classes of ring...|$|R
