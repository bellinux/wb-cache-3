This {{is accompanied by}} low levels <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> which have a favourable mix of fatty acids. Chicken meat contains about {{two to three times}} as much polyunsaturated fat as most types of red meat when measured by weight. However, for boneless, skinless chicken breast, the amount is much lower. A 100-g serving of baked chicken breast contains 4 g <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> and 31 g of protein, compared to 10 g <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> and 27 g of protein for the same portion of broiled, lean skirt steak.|$|E

40|$|The {{differences}} in intake amount <b>of</b> <b>fats</b> and oils {{and in the}} intake ratios of the constituent fatty acids {{are closely related to}} prevention and contraction of the life style related diseases. In the present paper we investigated and analyzed the usage status <b>of</b> <b>fats</b> and oils for cooking in mass feeding facilities and in the home. This study shows that fats and oils were used properly in 86 % of cooking in mass feeding facilities and in 72 % in private homes. Twelve types <b>of</b> <b>fats</b> and oils were used in mass feeding facilities compared with 15 in private homes. Survey results indicate that soybean oil was used most frequently in 88 %of the mass feeding facilities, sesame oil in 76 %, butter in 64 %, margarine in 52 %and rapeseed oil in 32 %. Both olive oil and sesame oil were used most frequently in 48 % of home cooking sites, margarine and butter in 41 %and 40 %, respectively, and both rapeseed oil and corn oil in 38 %. Reasons for selecting cooking fats and oils in the mass feeding facilities were "good for health" and "adhere to the brand of manufacturer", whereas the home cooking sites specified "good for health" and "in use from a long time ago" as the major reasons. In the selection <b>of</b> <b>fats</b> and oils. their reasonable prices were common considerations. Both the mass feeding facilities and home cooking sites were careful about reasonable prices <b>of</b> <b>fats</b> and oils for their selection, and also careful about preventing oxidation and deterioration of the oils. A lot <b>of</b> <b>fats</b> and oils for food are manufactured and sold these days in Japan. A suitable selection <b>of</b> <b>fats</b> and oils for each dish is required in consideration of harmony with food, cookery and so on.

5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is calculated}} by a dietitian for each child. Age, weight, activity levels, culture and food preferences all affect the meal plan. First, the energy requirements are set at 80â€“90% of the recommended daily amounts (RDA) for the child's age (the high-fat diet requires less energy to process than a typical high-carbohydrate diet). Highly active children {{or those with}} muscle spasticity require more calories than this; immobile children require less. The ketogenic ratio of the diet compares the weight <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> to the combined weight of carbohydrate and protein. This is typically 4:1, but children who are younger than 18months, older than 12years, or who are obese may be started on a 3:1 ratio. Fat is energy-rich, with 9kcal/g (38kJ/g) compared to 4kcal/g (17kJ/g) for carbohydrate or protein, so portions on the ketogenic diet are smaller than normal. The quantity <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> in the diet can be calculated from the overall energy requirements and the chosen ketogenic ratio. Next, the protein levels are set to allow for growth and body maintenance, and are around 1g protein for each kg of body weight. Lastly, the amount of carbohydrate is set according to what allowance is left while maintaining the chosen ratio. Any carbohydrate in medications or supplements must be subtracted from this allowance. The total daily amount <b>of</b> <b>fat,</b> protein and carbohydrate is then evenly divided across the meals.|$|E

5|$|A {{prominent}} predator is the short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) that {{eats the}} virgin queens during nuptial flight {{due to their}} high percentage <b>of</b> <b>fat.</b> Echidnas do not consume Iridomyrmex ants all year; instead, they usually attack nests during August to October, which is when the winged females and males, known as alates emerge from their nest. Queens will also face more threats during nuptial flight or after; birds such as currawongs, magpies and ravens, attracted by recently excavated soil, will dig out nests shortly after the queens have founded their colonies. Parasitic flatworms in the class Cestoda are known to infect Iridomyrmex.|$|E

5|$|A {{nutritional}} {{analysis of}} P.indusiatus (based on specimens collected from Nigeria) {{determined that the}} egg stage of the fungus contains (per 100g of fungus, dry weight) 33.6g of crude protein, 1.66g <b>of</b> <b>fat,</b> and 3.98g of carbohydrates. The egg stage was also measured to comprise 20.9g dietary fibre, and 88.76% moisture. The high levels of protein and fibre (which are comparable to values found in meat and vegetables, respectively) suggest that the egg form of P.indusiatus is a good food source. The concentration of several mineral elements, including potassium, sodium, and iron, was also favourable compared to fruits and vegetables, although the mineral composition in the fungus is dependent on their corresponding concentrations in the soil in which they grow.|$|E
30|$|Providing a basic {{description}} <b>of</b> <b>fats</b> has {{enabled us to}} determine that their composition {{is similar to the}} composition of diesel, with a lower carbon and hydrogen content and higher oxygen content. This is due to the type of fatty acids contained in animal fats compared to the hydrocarbons that make up diesel. We also see that the LCV <b>of</b> <b>fats</b> is around 10 % lower than that of diesel in all cases and that the density <b>of</b> <b>fats</b> is just under 10 % higher than that of diesel. As a result, the energy flow by volume is similar in fats and diesel. The main difference between diesel and fats is in the viscosity. At 40 Â°C, the viscosity <b>of</b> <b>fats</b> is 20 times higher than that of diesel. This property has a major impact on pulverization and proper combustion of liquid fuels and it should be remembered that at room temperature animal fats are mostly solid.|$|R

5|$|After the {{development}} of larger and faster-growing hogs (due to crosses between European and Asian breeds) in the 18th and 19th century in the United States, backyard and small-scale hog production provided an inexpensive means of converting waste food, crop waste, and garbage into calories (in a relatively small space and {{in a relatively short}} period of time). Many of those calories came in the form <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> and rendered lard. Lard was used for almost all cooking and was a fundamental component in many common homestead foods (many that today are still regarded as holiday and comfort foods) like biscuits and pies. The economic/caloric necessity of consuming lard and other saved fats may have led to the popularity of fried foods, not only in the US, but worldwide. In the 19th century cast iron became widely available for use in cooking. The combination of flour, lard, a chicken and a heavy pan placed over a relatively controllable flame became the beginning of today's fried chicken.|$|E
5|$|All whales have a {{thick layer}} of blubber. In species that live near the poles, the blubber can be as thick as 11 inches.
