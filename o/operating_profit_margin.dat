40|$|The study {{examines}} {{the performance of}} banks after acquisition. <b>Operating</b> <b>profits</b> have been analyzed for Indian Private and Public sector banks The results from the analysis of Pre and post-merger operating performance ratios for the acquiring banks show that <b>operating</b> <b>profit</b> <b>margins</b> were increased in post merger period {{and there was a}} marginal decline in return on net worth and capital employed. The sample consists of 16 banks. Data from Prowess database has been collected for three years before and after the acquisition has taken place. The results show that most of the banks had performed well in post merger period. The profitability margin such as gross <b>profit</b> <b>margin,</b> net <b>profit</b> <b>margins</b> are very high in the post merger period which signifies that after acquiring the target bank their performance was well appraised. The returns on investment and capital employed were increased after acquisition. Some of the Indian public sector banks showed a decline in the post merger period which may be attributed to the inefficiency and the increase of Non Performing Assets (NPAs) with the target banks.

50|$|In {{professional}} sports, {{there is}} a want for a competitive balance from the commissioner's office, as {{they do not want}} the same teams to win every year, largely because of concern that failing teams will go bankrupt, making the league’s market smaller.

This study purports to have proven that there is no difference in profit when {{there is a}} payroll increase, but there is a significant increase in winning percentage with an increase in payroll, so therefore teams can spend as they have to help their teams win, and general managers will prioritize wins over profits, allowing teams with more favorable revenue situations to spend more, leading to imbalance.|$|E
40|$|Is the {{licensing}} market efficient such that royalty rates reflect {{the costs and}} profitability across industries? This paper tries {{to answer the question}} through exploring the relationship between royalty rates and profitability. Our analysis shows that the reported royalty rates across industries do not converge with the rates generated by the 25 % rule, although they tend to fall between 25 % of gross margins and 25 % of operating margins. Regression analyses indicate that there is a linear relationship between the reported royalty rates and various profitability measures, which suggests that {{the licensing}} market is efficient and that cost structure and profitability across industries have been factored into royalty rate negotiation. Therefore, the 25 % rule is simply a special case of such a general linear relationship. A revisit to the data in Goldscheider et al (2002) further demonstrates that, a “forced ” linear fitting seems to make the average royalty rate equal to 23 % of the <b>operating</b> <b>profit</b> <b>margins,</b> rendering indirect support to the 25 % rule.

40|$|WP 06 / 2007; This work {{deals with}} two main issues: first, the {{possibility}} of identifying differences in firm economic returns (<b>operating</b> <b>profit</b> <b>margins)</b> for different groups of innovation strategy and second, {{the possibility of}} checking for factors explaining the probability of being within the best performers for each group of innovation strategy. It is an empirically based analysis using descriptive statistics (first part) and a probit econometric analysis (second part) where data are collected at firm level from two CIS surveys matched with economic accountability data for 902 Italian manufacturing firms for the period 1998 - 2000. The distribution analysis of <b>profit</b> <b>margins</b> by different populations of firms shows a better economic performance for groups characterized by more complex innovation strategies. Unexpectedly, the risk associated to economic returns is lower for groups where returns’ mean is higher. In this case skewness is higher too suggesting that reaching “excellence” is more difficult. The probit regressions account for {{the role played by}} different (market and firm) factors on the probability of being the best positioned for each firm population. This work gives two main messages: first, when studying the impact of R&D activity (both on firm productivity or competitiveness) it is worth to distinguish among different kinds of innovation strategy rather than limiting the analysis to aggregated results and second, it appears quite clear that competition awards more complex innovation strategies than simple R&D intra-muros activity...|$|R

40|$|It is {{important}} for national chain stores {{to be able to}} customize their prices in individual stores to adapt to the neighborhood demand. A lot of stores collect scanner data which can be used to determine the price distribution over products which optimizes profits, and yet often this data resource is under-utilized. In previous research both parametric (such as linear regression) and non-parametric (such as artificial neural networks) models have been successfully used for prediction. We propose to approach this problem from a different angle and using both parametric and non-parametric methods to investigate ways of combining the lower-level models into a high-level model so as to achieve a better predictor than either of the simpler methods by itself. We will work with the data provided by a supermarket chain which {{would like to be able}} to price more strategically the various products in its local stores. The scanner data is for the category Chilled Juices and consists of store-level weekly reports of prices and quantities sold for the 14 products in the category. The data was assembled for two years from 100 individual stores of the supermarket chain. Our research will produce a method able to predict for a given category of products at a store level the consumer demand of the products from their prices. Previous research indicates that micro-marketing pricing strategies can increase gross <b>profit</b> <b>margins</b> by 4 % to 10 %, which after administrative and operating costs are subtracted would translate into an increase of <b>operating</b> <b>profit</b> <b>margins</b> by 33 % to 83 %. This research will provide a valuable tool for marketers concerned with predicting consumer choice. The new models will also generalize to other Machine Learning applications where both methods are currently used. ...|$|R
40|$|To {{meet its}} {{objective}} of assisting the U. S. aviation industry with the technological {{challenges of the}} future, NASA must identify research areas that have the greatest potential for improving {{the operation of the}} air transportation system. To accomplish this, NASA is building an Aviation System Analysis Capability (ASAC). The ASAC differs from previous NASA modeling efforts in that the economic behavior of buyers and sellers in the air transportation and aviation industries is central to its conception. To link the economics of flight with the technology of flight, ASAC requires a parametrically based mode with extensions that link airline operations and investments in aircraft with aircraft characteristics. This model also must provide a mechanism for incorporating air travel demand and profitability factors into the airlines' investment decisions. Finally, the model must be flexible and capable of being incorporated into a wide-ranging suite of economic and technical models that are envisioned for ASAC. We describe a second-generation Air Carrier Investment Model that meets these requirements. The enhanced model incorporates econometric results from the supply and demand curves faced by U. S. -scheduled passenger air carriers. It uses detailed information about their fleets in 1995 to make predictions about future aircraft purchases.

40|$|AbstractThe Indian life {{insurance}} sector saw {{a series of}} regulatory changes in September 2010, with IRDA finally deciding {{to clamp down on}} the mis-selling of ULIPs as investment products designed for regulatory arbitrage, and not as insurance products. The major steps taken by the regulator included increasing the mortality risk cover to 10 times the annual premium, thereby, increasing the insurance content and reducing the investment content, significantly reducing the commissions, increasing the lock-in period from 3 to 5 years and imposing a ceiling on ULIP charges. Ironically, these changes can be attributed more to the much reported duel between capital market regulator SEBI and IRDA than any consumer activism. These new ULIP guidelines have resulted in new business premiums reducing by 21 % {{in the last six months}} of financial year 2010 - 11 (October 2010 – March 2011) for life insurers as compared to the previous financial year 2009 - 10, and have also adversely affected their <b>operating</b> <b>profit</b> <b>margins</b> due to reduction in ULIP fund management charges. The purpose of this paper is to closely examine the mortality and investment content of new ULIPs introduced by top 10 {{life insurance}} companies in India under the new regulatory regime and also review their performance and sustainability in the near future. The main objective is to research whether the current ULIP can be termed as a insurance product, or still it is very much an investment product despite the regulatory changes, whether agents are willing to sell them at such lower commissions and more importantly, whether customers’ interest and faith can be re-instated after so many years of mis-selling of ULIPs...|$|R

40|$|Derivatives {{had been}} a ‘dirty’ word among {{financial}} markets ever since the Financial Crisis of 2007 - 2009. Since then, there has been increased fear among managers that derivatives may cause {{more harm than good}} to their firms. Financial authorities and standard setters have rushed to implement more stringent and transparent requirements for the reporting of derivative positions in firms’ financial statements. It is important for managers to realize the positive potential from using derivatives as part of corporate financing and hedging activities. The prevalence of derivatives usage among Malaysian firms is found to be very low compared to developed countries. To increase derivatives usage in Malaysia, this research evaluates the performance of current derivative using firms against firms of similar industry that do not use derivatives via salient performance measures desirable by managers. The usage of derivatives was found to {{have a positive impact on}} overall firms’ profitability with derivative users enjoying higher returns on assets, but derivative users also found to have lower <b>operating</b> <b>profit</b> <b>margins.</b> No positive impacts were found for the financial position of firms. In terms of market performance, derivative users enjoy much higher firm valuation where their market to book value is significantly larger than that of firms that do not use derivatives. However, abnormal returns were lower for derivative users with the possible influence of the small firms’ effect. Sectors-wise, firms operating in the technology industry were found to have benefited the most from using derivatives while industrial product firms did not reap any advantages. Although there is no clear positive results from derivatives usage as intended, several explanations are posited including derivatives usage efficiency and small firms’ effect. It is important that firms’ managers are knowledgeable to minimize basis risks and hedge their exposures correctly...|$|R
