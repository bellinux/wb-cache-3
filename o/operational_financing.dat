40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{issues for}} Swedish firms {{associated with the}} usage of trade credits. With the lack of historical records, young and small firms cannot access finance as older and larger firms and therefore become more dependent upon short term trade credits from their suppliers {{as a way to}} financing operational activities. In terms of the trade credits usage among Swedish industrial firms the size and age of a company has direct implications. The age of a company has an inverse relationship with trade credits. Henceforth, it is assumed that, the older the firm, the better access to external financing. In effect, they can take advantage of early discounts terms offered by the customer. Additionally, findings suggest that smaller and younger firms have weaker access to external financing and therefore are more dependent upon their relatively larger suppliers. In essence, smaller and younger firms use more trade credits as a mean of <b>operational</b> <b>financing.</b> The empirical approach measuring trade credits among Swedish industrial firms shed light on aggregated means of trade credit usage in Sweden. This paper suggests a logical rationale behind findings supporting the main theories concerning trade credits. The findings of this paper could serve as a base for further development applying the model in a cross branch sectional fashion, analyzing the differences among branches associated with the less cyclical as well as the cyclical economy respectively.

Furthermore, it considers {{the selection of a}} suitable banking-house as a partner to put this <b>operational</b> <b>financing</b> into action. The resulting outcomes concerning the applicability of factoring compared to the suitability of bank overdraft are general and applicable not only to the KUBOUŠEK s. r. o. Company but also to other similar companies in need of finding a suitable financing method for their business operations. The conclusions in respect to selecting a suitable banking-house are specific for the analyzed company and time limited to the year of 2009 as that is the validity period of the terms and conditions offered by individual banks. The thesis explains in detail the functional principles of factoring. It lists individual types of factoring currently available in the Czech market, with further clarification of general benefits and disadvantages of using the individual types of factoring. The thesis continues to explain the functional principle of bank overdraft as currently used by the analyzed company, listing its general benefits and disadvantages, followed by a comparison of variant types of factoring in selected banks with presence in the Czech Republic. Based on this comparison, one factoring variant and one banking house are selected as the most suitable. The main objective of this thesis is to compare the currently applied variants of bank overdrafts and the selected most suitable factoring services available with the selected bank that KUBOUŠEK s. r. o could use...|$|E
40|$|Compared to {{traditional}} areas of finance, academics and practitioners have devoted {{less attention to}} working capital management. Although working capital management {{is an integral part}} of corporate finance and contributes to the success of <b>operational,</b> <b>financing</b> and investment decisions, this area of corporate finance is relatively unexplored in the finance literature. To this effect, the Finance and Treasury Association of Australia has been promoting research in this area in order to raise awareness among academics and practitioners. This thesis aims to contribute to the literature and examine the latest working capital management practices of Australian firms. This thesis proposes a new approach that reconciles traditional working capital management with risk management principles. By extending the traditional working capital approach, this research develops a risk-adjusted working capital model and examines the determinants of working capital for Australian firms over the period 2003 - 2008. Using dynamic panel data estimation and median regression techniques, this study finds mixed evidence supportive of the risk-adjusted working capital model. Sectoral analysis reveals heterogeneous working capital patterns. It also identifies the sectors with high reliance on cash and inventory. After controlling for fundamental factors (such as sales, size, leverage and profitability), significant differences in working capital practices are apparent. Firms with low-leverage appear to hold higher cash holdings than high-leverage ones. The evidence provided does not support the window dressing hypothesis. The second section of this thesis examines the determinants of corporate profitability for publicly listed Australian firms by using three measures of corporate profitability namely, net profit, economic value added and return on assets. Through dynamic panel estimation technique, the determinants of corporate profitability are tested. Using panel least squares methods, median regression methodology and after controlling for sectoral variations, the findings shows that the determinants of corporate profitability vary across Australian sectors. The analysis is extended to control for firm’s fundamental characteristics such as working capital, corporate governance ratings and performance, and the results are still supportive of heterogeneous determinants. It is discernable that firms with the worst working capital deficit exhibit a significant negative relationship to debt ratio. The same significant negative relationship is observed between firms with poor corporate governance ratings and debt ratio. Profitable firms on the other hand have a tendency to hold positive cash holdings, whereas non- profitable firms tend to exhibit negative cash holdings. Cash flow adequacy is one of the critical factors influencing corporate credit decisions. Since working capital deals with short-term cash flows, this thesis explores the interaction between working capital and corporate credit ratings. By employing working capital and firm’s characteristics as explanatory variables, this study examines the determinants of corporate credit ratings. Following a rigorous data selection process, corporate credit ratings of Australian firms are collected from Standard &amp; Poor’s for the period 2003 - 2008. By employing ordered logit models, this thesis provides evidence on the determinants of corporate credit ratings. Empirical evidence suggests that working capital influences corporate credit ratings and this research shows that cash, inventory and size are determinants of corporate credit ratings...|$|E

However, there was no significant difference in the prices received by the farmers. The difference in performance can be explained by access to farming resources suggesting that provision of sound infrastructure and public goods could further improve the livelihoods of farmers, both contract and non-contract.

The annual account statements produced by each of the trusts for financial years (FY) 2011 – 12; 2012 – 13; 2013 – 14 and 2014 – 15 were reviewed and the key financial indicators (KFIs) for each organisation were collected. KFIs for the period just prior to enactment of HSCA 2012 (FY 2011 – 12, FY 2012 – 13) were compared with the corresponding values for the period after the enactment of HSCA 2012. The clinical services provided by the Shelford Group increased year on year by 10. 6 %, 7. 5 % and 4 % respectively as did their combined annual income. In FY 2014 – 15, the Shelford Group collectively provided 14 735 000 patient care episodes and reported a combined annual income of £ 9 672 066 000. There was no significant difference in the median operating surplus returned by the Shelford Group before and after HSCA 2012; despite this, 5 of the 10 Shelford Group members delivered an operational deficit in FY 2014 – 15. The level of financial liabilities and total capital employed remained stable. There were significant improvements in total assets employed in the Shelford Group in the 2 years after the enactment of HSCA 2012 compared to before.
