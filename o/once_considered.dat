5|$|Although the lilac-brown bolete was <b>once</b> <b>considered</b> edible, {{caution is}} {{typically}} recommended in modern field guides when considering this bolete {{for the table}} after several poisonings were reported in northeastern North America.

5|$|Dinheirosaurus is a diplodocid, a {{relative}} of Apatosaurus, Diplodocus, Barosaurus, Supersaurus, and Tornieria. Among those, the closest relative to Dinheirosaurus is Supersaurus, and together they form a clade of primitive diplodocids. While they were <b>once</b> <b>considered</b> to be diplodocines they are likely more basal than Apatosaurus.|$|E

Mussorgsky's musical style, <b>once</b> <b>considered</b> unpolished, is now admired for its originality. While Rimsky-Korsakov's {{arrangement}} of Night on Bald Mountain is still the version generally performed, Rimsky-Korsakov's other revisions, like his version of Boris Godunov, have been replaced by Mussorgsky's original.|$|E
5|$|<b>Once</b> <b>considered</b> {{as having}} the largest angular {{diameter}} of any star in the sky after the Sun, Betelgeuse lost that distinction in 1997 {{when a group of}} astronomers measured R Doradus with a diameter of 57.0 ± 0.5mas, although R Doradus, being much closer to Earth at about 200ly, has a linear diameter roughly one-third that of Betelgeuse.|$|E

5|$|About 1% of school-age {{children}} and adolescents have Tourette's. It was <b>once</b> <b>considered</b> a rare and bizarre syndrome, most often associated with coprolalia (the utterance of obscene words or socially inappropriate and derogatory remarks), but this symptom is present in only {{a small minority of}} people with Tourette's. The condition was named by Jean-Martin Charcot (1825–1893) on behalf of his resident, Georges Albert Édouard Brutus Gilles de la Tourette (1857–1904), a French physician and neurologist, who published an account of nine patients with Tourette's in 1885.|$|E

5|$|Altan Khan {{eventually}} {{made peace with}} China when it opened border cities for trade in 1571, alleviating the Mongol need to raid. This, coupled with Qi and Tan's efforts to secure the frontier, brought a period of relative peace along the border. However, minor raids still happened {{from time to time}} when the profits of plunder outweighed those of trade, prompting the Ming to close all gaps along the frontier around Beijing. Areas of difficult terrain <b>once</b> <b>considered</b> impassable were also walled off, leading to the well-known vistas of a stone-faced Great Wall snaking over dramatic landscapes that tourists still see today.|$|E
5|$|Atomic carbon {{is a very}} {{short-lived}} species and, therefore, carbon is stabilized {{in various}} multi-atomic structures with different molecular configurations called allotropes. The three relatively well-known allotropes of carbon are amorphous carbon, graphite, and diamond. <b>Once</b> <b>considered</b> exotic, fullerenes are nowadays commonly synthesized and used in research; they include buckyballs, carbon nanotubes, carbon nanobuds and nanofibers. Several other exotic allotropes have also been discovered, such as lonsdaleite (questionable), glassy carbon, carbon nanofoam and linear acetylenic carbon (carbyne).|$|E

Team Canada General Manager Steve Yzerman continued to express confidence in Phaneuf during a summer camp held in Calgary, but Phaneuf was not among the seven defencemen ultimately selected for the team.|$|E

5|$|Japan is {{the third}} largest {{automobile}} producer in the world, and is home to Toyota, the world's largest automobile company. The Japanese consumer electronics industry, <b>once</b> <b>considered</b> the strongest in the world, is currently {{in a state of}} decline as competition arises in countries like South Korea, the United States and China. However, despite also facing similar competition from South Korea and China, the Japanese shipbuilding industry is expected to remain strong due to an increased focus on specialized, high-tech designs.|$|E
5|$|Neil Edward Goldschmidt (born June 16, 1940) is a Jewish-American {{businessman}} and Democratic politician {{from the state}} of Oregon who held local, state and federal offices over three decades.

His legacy and career were severely damaged by revelations that he had a sexual relationship with a young teenage girl during his first term as mayor of Portland.|$|E
5|$|No {{consensus}} existed {{regarding the}} taxonomy of Psittaciformes until recently. The {{placement of the}} Strigopoidea species has been variable in the past. They were <b>once</b> <b>considered</b> part of the Psittacoidea, but recent 21st-century studies place this group of New Zealand species as their own superfamily next to the Cacatuoidea and remaining members of the Psittacoidea. Many studies have confirmed the unique placement of this group {{at the base of}} the parrot tree. Most authors now recognize this group as a separate taxon containing two families: Nestoridae and Strigopidae. Conversely, the relationships among various cockatoo genera are largely resolved.|$|E

40|$|Daniel Defoe's work {{displays}} {{a keen interest}} in stories of supernatural encounters. <b>Once</b> <b>considering</b> how one might prove supernatural occurrences and whether one can trust eyewitness accounts, Defoe demonstrates that more is at stake. Like his contemporaries, Defoe wonders about the range of scientific insight, and about the moral and epistemological ramifications of unchallenged trust and faith. His transformations of the supernatural probe the boundaries of knowledge and evidence and play with the limits of cognition, emphasizing the inseparability of mind and emotion...|$|R

On 21 December 2004, she announced she had finished writing it, along with the release date of 16 July. Bloomsbury unveiled the cover on 8 March 2005.|$|E
5|$|Some {{activities}} that were <b>once</b> <b>considered</b> entertaining, particularly public punishments, {{have been removed}} from the public arena. Others, such as fencing or archery, once necessary skills for some, have become serious sports and even professions for the participants, at the same time developing into entertainment with wider appeal for bigger audiences. In the same way, other necessary skills, such as cooking, have developed into performances among professionals, staged as global competitions and then broadcast for entertainment. What entertainment is for one group or individual may be regarded as work by another.|$|E
5|$|Tall spined {{vertebrae}} {{from the}} Early Cretaceous of England were <b>once</b> <b>considered</b> {{to be very}} similar to those of Acrocanthosaurus, and in 1988 Gregory S. Paul named them as a second species of the genus, A. altispinax. These bones were originally assigned to Altispinax, an English theropod otherwise known only from teeth, and this assignment led to at least one author proposing that Altispinax itself was a synonym of Acrocanthosaurus. These vertebrae were later assigned to the new genus Becklespinax, separate from both Acrocanthosaurus and Altispinax.|$|E

It is a mystery about a door that - once opened - is almost impossible to close, a story about curiosity, temptation and power.|$|R
