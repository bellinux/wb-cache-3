5|$|The focus <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>debate</b> often {{centers on}} a {{phenomenon}} named by sexologist Pepper Schwartz in 1983. Schwartz found that long-term lesbian couples report having less sexual contact than heterosexual or homosexual male couples, calling this lesbian bed death. However, lesbians dispute the study's definition of sexual contact, and introduced other factors such as deeper connections existing between women that make frequent sexual relations redundant, greater sexual fluidity in women causing them to move from heterosexual to bisexual to lesbian numerous times through their lives—or reject the labels entirely. Further arguments attested that the study was flawed and misrepresented accurate sexual contact between women, or sexual contact between women has increased since 1983 as many lesbians find themselves freer to sexually express themselves.|$|E

25|$|The ebb {{and flow}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>debate</b> {{can be seen in}} the Mughul's dynastic mausoleums {{stretching}} back to that of their ancestor Timur. Built in 1403 AD (810 AH) Timur is buried in the Gur-e Amir in Samarkand, under a fluted dome. The tomb employs a traditional Persian iwan as an entrance. The 1528 AD (935 AH) Tomb of Babur in Kabul is much more modest in comparison, with a simple cenotaph exposed to the sky, laid out in the centre of a walled garden.|$|E

50|$|Some sociologists, for {{instance}} Karl Polanyi, {{have argued that}} relative differences in economic wealth {{are more important than}} absolute deprivation, and that it is more significant in determining human quality <b>of</b> life. <b>This</b> <b>debate</b> has important consequences for social policy, particularly on whether poverty can be eliminated simply by raising total wealth or whether egalitarian measures are also needed.|$|R
25|$|Though the {{practice}} of the prozbul is largely archaic, its institution has far reaching effects to this day, setting somewhat of a precedent in terms of legal fiction. The decision was groundbreaking and controversial. “Later Amoraim expressed their astonishment at the fact that Hillel dared to abrogate the Mosaic institution of the release of all debts every seventh year”. There is a major debate in the Talmud whether rabbis have the authority to uproot from the Torah and the issue of prozbul {{is one of the first}} examples <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>debate</b> being tested.|$|E
25|$|The 1992 Maastricht Treaty imposed {{reciprocity}} {{inside the}} European Union concerning voting rights in local elections; this already existed for the European elections. In several European states, {{the public debate}} {{on the right of}} foreigners to vote was therefore renewed, as some foreign residents had the right to vote (European foreign residents) while others, non-Europeans, did not. As a result <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>debate,</b> Luxembourg, Lithuania, Slovenia and Belgium extended the right to vote, in different manners, to all foreign residents (which was already the case in Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Netherlands).|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} four years the three Balkenende {{cabinets}} had implemented an ambitious program of social-economic reforms, including tax cuts, reforms to the social welfare system and investments in education. Their aim was to jump start the Dutch economy. Initially there was great public dissatisfaction with this policy, with large demonstrations in 2003, 2004 and 2005 by the main labour union FNV and the three main opposition parties. They criticised the government for taking these measures at the wrong point in time, during a recession, and they claimed that the government made the poor and socially weaker pay for the economic recovery. A major focus <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>debate</b> was on the fact that more than 10% of the people were said to live in poverty, as exemplified by the rising number of 'voedselbanken' (give-away shops for food). As the economy began to perform better in 2006 the public dissatisfaction decreased.|$|E

25|$|Further, on March 28, 2017, Trump {{signed an}} {{executive}} order to rewrite President Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan. Much of this incentive is driven by expanding the workforce in the coal industry, however it is still undetermined how soon this will take affect. With continued trends in repealing past rules and regulations regarding Climate change under the Trump administration, the commitment to the Paris climate agreement held at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference is under question. Uncertainty about the development <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>debate</b> sparks much global controversy and unclarity in the reactions and future prognoses of climate and environmental politics. While international concerns are expressed, economists {{do not think that}} the proposed repeals will have much effect. Demand for coal on the national market has been declining and is still low, so that changes to the pollution standards and greenhouse gas emissions do not actually change the market drastically.|$|E
25|$|Within the Roman Catholic Church, {{there has}} existed a {{sometimes}} tense relationship between Jesuits and the Holy See due to questioning of official church teaching and papal directives, {{such as those}} on abortion, birth control, women deacons, homosexuality, and liberation theology. Usually, this theological free thinking is academically oriented, being prevalent at the university level. From this standpoint, the function <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>debate</b> is less to challenge the magisterium than to publicize the results of historical research or to illustrate the church's ability to compromise in a pluralist society based on shared values that do not always align with religious teachings. This has not prevented Popes from appointing Jesuits to powerful positions in the church. John Paul II and Benedict XVI together appointed ten Jesuit Cardinals to notable jobs. Under Benedict, Archbishop Luis Ladaria Ferrer was Secretary of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and Federico Lombardi was Vatican Press Secretary.|$|E
25|$|The land redistribution, {{government}} reform, and colonization program strengthened and stabilized the Zhou government, {{while the}} Duke of Zhou invented the Mandate of Heaven {{in response to}} the rebellion. As a propaganda tool, the Mandate was used to legitimize the new dynasty morally and spiritually. Greatly empowered, the Zhou dynasty entered an era of prosperity and expansion that lasted until it was severely weakened by the war with Chu 961–957 BC. The triumvirate of Duke Dan of Zhou, King Cheng, and Duke Shi of Shao continued to rule the Zhou kingdom for three more years after the civil war. Eventually, however, Dan and his half-brother Shi fell out about the right form of government. Duke Dan, his own position as royal chancellor and regent in mind, opted for a meritocracy, while Duke Shi believed that the power should remain with the royal family to prevent usurpation. Possibly as result <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>debate,</b> the Duke of Zhou finally retired from court politics in 1036 BC, returning the official power to King Cheng and leaving the Duke of Shao as {{the most powerful man in}} the kingdom.|$|E

500|$|The {{final result}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>debate</b> was Resolution 21, {{which called for}} [...] "strategic raids" [...] on South Vietnamese forces in order to regain {{territory}} lost to the ARVN since {{the conclusion of the}} peace accord and to test the reaction of both the South Vietnamese military and the American government in Washington, D.C. The first blows of the new policy were delivered between March and November 1974, when the communists attacked ARVN forces in Quảng Đức Province and at Biên Hòa. Hanoi's leaders watched closely and anxiously as strikes by American B-52 Stratofortress bombers failed to materialize. During these operations, however, PAVN retook the military initiative, gaining experience in combined arms operations, depleting ARVN forces, causing them to expend large quantities of ammunition, and gaining avenues of approach and jump-off points for any new offensive.|$|E
500|$|In {{the context}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>debate,</b> music writers have {{interpreted}} Illmatic as an admonishment for hip hop purists and practitioners. In the opening track, [...] "The Genesis", Nas bemoans {{the lack of}} legitimacy among other MCs in the projects, insisting that he has [...] "Been doin' this shit since back then." [...] Citing songs such as “Life's a Bitch”, Guthrie Ramsay Jr. argues that Nas “set a benchmark for rappers in an artistic field consumed by constantly shifting notions of 'realness', authenticity, and artistic credibility." [...] Sohail Daulatzai writes: [...] "Though Illmatic was highly anticipated release, far from under the radar, Nas's taking it back to 'the dungeons of rap' was…a kind of exorcism or purging ('where fake niggas don’t make it back') {{that was at the}} very least trying to claim a different aesthetic of resistance and rebellion that was all too aware of hip-hop's newfound mainstream potential." ...|$|E
500|$|Before the Human Rights Act {{was brought}} before parliament, the government's whitepaper {{considered}} {{that it was}} necessary to prevent courts from setting aside legislation on the basis of incompatibility (reflecting a strong need to respect parliamentary sovereignty). However, the effect on parliamentary sovereignty has been criticised despite the safeguards put in place. Section 3 has been defended, however, by reference to the enhanced morality and constitutionalism of the new system, prompted by an [...] "incoming tide" [...] of human rights. Aileen Kavanagh considers the choice of a court in cases not a question of parliamentary sovereignty, but a complex question of how far the judiciary can perform a legislative function in that area. She considers the political and legislative pressure on government after section 3 or 4 overwhelming {{to the extent that the}} concept of parliamentary sovereignty should be [...] "eliminated". However, other writers have stressed the important of the formal right to ignore either decision. The result <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>debate</b> has been to label section 3 either a [...] "radical tool" [...] to implement human rights, or a [...] "signficiant limitation" [...] of Parliament's will.|$|E

500|$|In the 1967 British Home Championship, Baxter {{produced}} a dominating but controversial performance for Scotland, tantalising England, {{who had won}} the World Cup in 1966, by playing [...] "keepie uppie" [...] (ball juggling) while waiting for teammates to get into good positions. Some commentators accepted that humiliating the opposition was a valid objective, while others regarded it as childish and thought Scotland should have won a more convincing victory than the actual 3–2 scoreline. Teammate Denis Law expressed opinions on both sides <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>debate,</b> saying that Baxter was [...] "the best player on the park" [...] and {{the main reason for}} the Scots' victory, but complaining that Baxter's lack of urgency had prevented Scotland from thoroughly avenging the 9–3 defeat in April 1961. Alex Ferguson said Baxter's performance [...] "could have been set to music". In this game Baxter also conspired with Billy Bremner against Alan Ball, sending Bremner a [...] "50-50" [...] pass, which allowed Bremner to [...] "hit Ball like a train" [...] when Ball contested possession. As Scotland were the first team to beat England after the 1966 FIFA World Cup, the Tartan Army proclaimed themselves [...] "unofficial world champions".|$|E
500|$|During 1936 and 1937, the Air Staff {{had been}} {{fighting}} with the Cabinet over the rearmament plans; the Air Staff wanted a substantial bomber force and only minor increases in fighters, whilst the Minister for Defence Co-ordination, Sir Thomas Inskip, successfully pushed for a greater role for the fighter force. Newall was promoted during the middle <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>debate,</b> and proved perhaps more flexible than might have been expected. In 1938 he supported sharp increases in aircraft production, including double-shift working and duplication of factories, and pushed {{for the creation of}} a dedicated organisation to repair and refit damaged aircraft. He supported expenditure on the new, heavily armed, Hurricane and Spitfire fighters, essential to re-equip Fighter Command. He even began to distance himself, albeit slightly, from orthodox bomber philosophy, noting to the Minister for Air that [...] "no one can say with absolute certainty that a nation can be knocked out from the air, because no-one has yet attempted it". Discussing plans for reacting to a war with Italy, in early 1939, he opposed a French proposal to force Italy's surrender by the use of heavy bombing raids against the north, arguing that it would be unlikely to force the country out of the war without the need for ground combat.|$|E
500|$|Political Animals and Animal Politics was {{reviewed}} by Garner for Environmental Values, and the philosophers Josh Milburn and Dan Hooley for the Political Studies Review and the Journal of Animal Ethics respectively. Garner lamented {{the absence of}} many of the key voices in the political theory literature on animal ethics—such as Cochrane, Donaldson and Kymlicka, O'Sullivan, Tony Milligan, Kimberly Smith or Garner himself—in the book, meaning that Political Animals and Animal Politics [...] "takes on the role of an observer <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>debate</b> rather than directly contributing to it in a leading sense". In addition, he felt that the book offered little consideration of the details of the work of these leading theorists, identifying the absence of discussion of Cochrane's interest-based rights approach, a superficial consideration of Regan's account of animal rights, an oversimplification of his own position and a lack of context to understand the respective work of Kimberly Smith and O'Sullivan. He considered Wisseburg's chapter to be the only one which engages with the debate about the political turn in general, but notes that Wissenburg's approach is a negative one; Garner considers this unsurprising, given that Wissenburg is a green political theorist with little sympathy for [...] "animal political theory".|$|E
