5|$|While the Self-Incrimination Clause {{primarily}} implicates the law {{of criminal}} investigations, the Clause also protects against self-incrimination that may occur at trial. Plainly, the Clause prevents the government from compelling the defendant to testify against himself or herself at trial. Further, if the defendant chooses to testify, the Clause prevents the state from requiring her to testify first. But, if the defendant testifies, she cannot claim the privilege against self-incrimination with respect to cross-examination within the scope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>direct</b> examination.|$|E
5|$|A {{few weeks}} after Morris {{announced}} his departure from the team, Martin announced that David Nedohin, the fourth player on his former provincial rival Randy Ferbey's team, would join Martin's team. Martin and team won their first event of the season at the Shoot-Out. They made the semifinals in their next event at the Point Optical Curling Classic, but Martin injured his back during the semifinal game. Jeff Sharp subbed in at lead, and Martin's team finished the event as runners-up to Jeff Stoughton. After winning the final <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Direct</b> Horizontal Drilling Fall Classic over Brock Virtue and posting a semifinals finish at the Cactus Pheasant Classic, Martin played in the Masters Grand Slam, finishing the round robin with a 3–1 win-loss record. He proceeded to win his games over Kevin Koe and Liu Rui before reaching the final, where he played a close game with Glenn Howard until Howard pulled away with the win.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 35,000–40,000 {{people were}} killed outright by the bombing at Nagasaki. A total of 60,000–80,000 fatalities resulted, including from long-term health effects, the strongest of which was leukemia, with an attributable risk of 46% for bomb victims. Others died later from related blast and burn injuries, and hundreds more from radiation illnesses from exposure to the bomb's initial radiation. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>direct</b> deaths and injuries sustained from the bombing were munitions or industrial workers. Mitsubishi's industrial production in the city were also severed by the attack; the dockyard would have produced at 80 percent of its full capacity within three to four months, the steel works would have required {{a year to get}} back to substantial production, the electric works would have resumed some production within two months and been back at capacity within six months, and the restoration of the arms plant to 60 to 70 percent of former capacity would have required 15 months. The Mitsubishi-Urakami Ordnance Works, the factory that manufactured the type 91 torpedoes released in the attack on Pearl Harbor, was destroyed in the blast.|$|E

3000|$|Relevant {{concepts}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>directed</b> graph {{are introduced}} here to describe <b>the</b> radial structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distribution network. <b>The</b> <b>directed</b> graph has two indices: in-degree and out-degree, represented by λ^in (v_i [...]) and λ^out (v_i [...]), respectively. As {{a special case}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>directed</b> graph, <b>the</b> rooted tree can describe <b>the</b> open-loop structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distribution network [12]. However, loops may occur in the network when tie switches come into use, which causes <b>the</b> in-degrees <b>of</b> some nodes to exceed 1. In this case, other branches must be disconnected to guarantee the radial operational structure.|$|R

Owain Anglicised his name, becoming Owen Tudor, and was himself the grandfather of King Henry VII of England, the founder of the House of Tudor.|$|E
5|$|Jason {{made his}} comic book {{debut in the}} 1993 {{adaptation}} of Jason Goes to Hell, written by Andy Mangels. The three-issue series was a condensed version of the film, with a few added scenes that were never shot. Jason made his first appearance outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>direct</b> adaptations in Satan's Six No. 4, published in 1993, which {{is a continuation of}} the events of Jason Goes to Hell. In 1995, Nancy A. Collins wrote a three-issue, non-canonical miniseries involving a crossover between Jason and Leatherface. The story involves Jason stowing away aboard a train, after being released from Crystal Lake when the area is drained due to heavy toxic waste dumping. Jason meets Leatherface, who adopts him into his family after the two become friends. Eventually they turn on each other. In 1994 four young adult novels were released under the title of Friday the 13th. They did not feature Jason explicitly, but revolve around people becoming possessed by Jason when they put on his mask.|$|E
5|$|The Alpine Spaniel was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>direct</b> genetic {{progenitors}} to the St. Bernard.

Unfortunately ice would form on the longer hair, and seeing that the dogs were no longer effective rescue dogs, the monasteries gave them away {{to people in the}} surrounding Swiss valleys.|$|E

5|$|The Emperor's great-grandmother, Maria I of Portugal, {{had been}} a queen regnant. However, she had been married to her uncle, Pedro III of Portugal who was a Braganza. This meant that her {{offspring}} would continue {{to belong to the}} House of Braganza. Emperor Pedro II was the last <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>direct</b> male line in Brazil descended from Dom Afonso I, first king of Portugal and founder, in 1139, of the dynasty which headed the Brazilian Empire. There were two other male Braganzas, albeit living abroad: Pedro II's half-brother Rodrigo Delfim Pereira and his cousin Miguel, Duke of Braganza. Both were barred from the line of succession, however. The former because he was an illegitimate son, and the latter because he was a foreigner and not a descendant of the first Brazilian Emperor, Pedro I.|$|E
5|$|The {{brightness}} of the Sun can cause pain from looking at it with the naked eye; however, doing so for brief periods is not hazardous for normal non-dilated eyes. Looking directly at the Sun causes phosphene visual artifacts and temporary partial blindness. It also delivers about 4milliwatts of sunlight to the retina, slightly heating it and potentially causing damage in eyes that cannot respond properly to the brightness. UV exposure gradually yellows {{the lens of the}} eye over a period of years, and is thought to contribute to the formation of cataracts, but this depends on general exposure to solar UV, and not whether one looks directly at the Sun. Long-duration viewing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>direct</b> Sun with the naked eye can begin to cause UV-induced, sunburn-like lesions on the retina after about 100 seconds, particularly under conditions where the UV light from the Sun is intense and well focused; conditions are worsened by young eyes or new lens implants (which admit more UV than aging natural eyes), Sun angles near the zenith, and observing locations at high altitude.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} of the School's operation, the {{character}} of the area had changed beyond recognition. Historically, Tottenham had consisted of four villages on Ermine Street (later the A10 road), surrounded by marshland and farmland. The construction of the Northern and Eastern Railway in 1840, with stations at Tottenham Hale and Marsh Lane (later Northumberland Park), made commuting from Tottenham to central London feasible for the first time (albeit by a circuitous eight-mile route via Stratford, more than double the distance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>direct</b> road route), as well as providing direct connections to the Port of London. In 1872 the Great Eastern Railway opened a direct line from Enfield to Liverpool Street station, including a station at Bruce Grove, close to Bruce Castle; the railway provided subsidised workmen's fares to allow poor commuters to live in Tottenham and commute to work in central London. As a major rail hub, Tottenham grew into a significant residential and industrial area; {{by the end of the}} 19th century, the only remaining undeveloped areas were the grounds of Bruce Castle itself, and the waterlogged floodplains of the River Lea at Tottenham Marshes and of the River Moselle at Broadwater Farm.|$|E
