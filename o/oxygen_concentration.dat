5|$|The lungs in {{amphibians}} are primitive {{compared to}} those of amniotes, possessing few internal septa and large alveoli, and consequently having a comparatively slow diffusion rate for oxygen entering the blood. Ventilation is accomplished by buccal pumping. Most amphibians, however, are able to exchange gases with the water or air via their skin. To enable sufficient cutaneous respiration, the surface of their highly vascularised skin must remain moist to allow the oxygen to diffuse at a sufficiently high rate. Because <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentration</b> in the water increases at both low temperatures and high flow rates, aquatic amphibians in these situations can rely primarily on cutaneous respiration, as in the Titicaca water frog and the hellbender salamander. In air, where oxygen is more concentrated, some small species can rely solely on cutaneous gas exchange, most famously the plethodontid salamanders, which have neither lungs nor gills. Many aquatic salamanders and all tadpoles have gills in their larval stage, with some (such as the axolotl) retaining gills as aquatic adults.|$|E

40|$|Diel {{variations}} in N 2 fixation (acetylene reduction), CO 2 fixation, and <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrations</b> were measured, on three separate occasions, in a marine microbial mat located on Shackleford Banks, North Carolina. Nitrogenase activity (NA) {{was found to}} be inversely correlated with CO 2 fixation and, in two of the three diel periods studied, was higher at night than during the day. <b>Oxygen</b> <b>concentrations</b> within the top 3 mm of the mat ranged from 0 to 400 μM on a diel cycle; anaerobic conditions generally persisted below 4 mm. NA in the mat was profoundly affected by naturally occurring <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrations.</b> Experimentally elevated <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrations</b> resulted in a significant depression of NA, whereas the addition of the Photosystem II inhibitor 3 (3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea decreased <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrations</b> within the mat and resulted in a significant short-term enhancement of NA. Mat N 2 -fixing microorganisms include cyanobacteria and heterotrophic, photoautotrophic, and chemolithotrophic eubacteria. Measured (whole-mat) NA is probably due to a combination of the NA of each of these groups of organisms. The relative contributions of each group to whole-mat NA probably varied during diel and seasonal (successional) cycles. Reduced compounds derived from photosynthetic CO 2 fixation appeared to be an important source of energy for NA during the day, whereas heterotrophic or chemolithotrophic utilization of reduced compounds appeared to be an important source of energy for NA at night, under reduced ambient <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrations.</b> Previous estimates of N 2 fixation calculated on the basis of daytime measurements may have seriously underestimated diel and seasonal nitrogen inputs in mat systems...|$|R

After 4 days of exposure to 7, 2, and 0. 5 % O 2 (n = 3 per group), protein synthesis was evaluated. All analyses were compared with control cultures at 21 % O 2. Human myofibroblasts turned to hypoxia-driven gene expression, indicated by VEGF expression, at <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrations</b> of 4 % and lower. Gene expression levels of procollagen 1 (I) and 1 (III) increased to 138 ± 26 and 143 ± 19 %, respectively, for all <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrations</b> below 4 %. At 2 % O 2, LH 2 and LOX gene expression levels were higher than control cultures (340 ± 53 and 136 ± 29 %, respectively), and these levels increased even further with decreasing <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrations</b> (611 ± 176 and 228 ± 45 %, respectively, at 0. 5 % O 2).

At a lower growth rate (D = 0. 09. h- 1), however, and at lower <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrations</b> cellular levels of both nitrogenase proteins were decreased.

40|$|Background: Global {{warming and}} the {{alteration}} {{of the global}} nitrogen cycle are major anthropogenic threats to the environment. Denitrification, the biological conversion of nitrate to gaseous nitrogen, removes a substantial fraction of the nitrogen from aquatic ecosystems, and can therefore help to reduce eutrophication effects. However, potential responses of denitrification to warming are poorly understood. Although several studies have reported increased denitrification rates with rising temperature, the impact of temperature on denitrification seems to vary widely between systems. Methodology/Principal Findings: We explored the effects of warming on denitrification rates using microcosm experiments, field measurements and a simple model approach. Our results suggest that a three degree temperature rise will double denitrification rates. By performing experiments at fixed <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrations</b> {{as well as with}} <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrations</b> varying freely with temperature, we demonstrate that this strong temperature dependence of denitrification can be explained by a systematic decrease of <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrations</b> with rising temperature.

Conclusions/Significance: Our results show that denitrification rates in aquatic ecosystems are strongly temperature dependent, and that this is amplified by the temperature dependencies of photosynthesis and respiration.
