5|$|David Mark Morrissey (born 21 June 1964) is an English actor, director, {{producer}} and screenwriter. At {{the age of}} 18, he was cast in the television series <b>One</b> <b>Summer</b> (1983). After making <b>One</b> <b>Summer,</b> Morrissey attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, then acted with the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre for four years.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Morrissey {{auditioned for}} <b>One</b> <b>Summer,</b> a {{television}} series by Willy Russell for Yorkshire Television and Channel 4 about two Liverpool boys who run away to Wales <b>one</b> <b>summer.</b> Russell had been {{attached to the}} Everyman for many years, and Morrissey had seen {{him while he was}} working behind the bar downstairs from the theatre, though the two had never been introduced. Morrissey went to at least eight auditions, and in one read for the part of Icky opposite Paul McGann, who was reading for Billy. McGann, five years older than Morrissey, believed that he was too old to be playing the part of 16-year-old Billy, and stepped back from the production, leaving the role to go to Morrissey. Spencer Leigh got the part of Icky and Ian Hart played the supporting role of Rabbit. Russell had a professional disagreement with the director Gordon Flemyng and producer Keith Richardson over the casting of 18-year-old Morrissey and Leigh; he believed that the sympathy of 16-year-olds running away was lost by casting older actors. Russell subsequently had his name removed from the credits of the original broadcast. After filming <b>One</b> <b>Summer</b> for five months, Morrissey went travelling in Kenya with his cousins. When he returned to Britain, <b>One</b> <b>Summer</b> was being broadcast, and he dealt with the new experience of being recognised in public.|$|E

5|$|The Master {{spends most}} of his time {{drinking}} alcohol, and people begin trying to convince him to move into a nursing home, where no dogs are allowed. <b>One</b> <b>summer,</b> an outbreak of rabies spreads through the fox population. After one infected fox attacks a group of human children, the same people approach the Master and ask his help in killing the foxes. He uses traps and poison to try to kill as many foxes as possible; however, the poison also kills domestic animals. After a human child dies from eating it, the humans remove all of the poison, then the Master organizes a hunt in which large numbers of people line up and walk straight into the woods, flushing out foxes to be shot. The aging Tod escapes all three events, as well as an attempt at coursing him with greyhounds.|$|E
