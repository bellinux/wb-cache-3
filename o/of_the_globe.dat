5|$|Climate {{scientists}} have {{hypothesized that the}} jet stream will gradually weaken {{as a result of}} global warming. Trends such as Arctic sea ice decline, reduced snow cover, evapotranspiration patterns, and other weather anomalies are expected to make the Arctic heat up faster than other parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>globe.</b> This in turn reduces the temperature gradient that drives jet stream winds, causing the jet stream to become weaker and more variable in its course.|$|E
5|$|Ocean {{circulation}} patterns have {{a strong}} influence on climate and weather and, in turn, the food supply of both humans and other organisms. Scientists have warned of the possibility, {{under the influence of}} climate change, of a sudden alteration in circulation patterns of ocean currents that could drastically alter the climate in some regions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>globe.</b> Ten per cent of the world's population—about 600 million people—live in low-lying areas vulnerable to sea level rise.|$|E

5|$|Robert Hues (1553 – 24 May 1632) was an English {{mathematician}} and geographer. He attended St. Mary Hall at Oxford, {{and graduated}} in 1578. Hues {{became interested in}} geography and mathematics, and studied navigation at a school set up by Walter Raleigh. During a trip to Newfoundland, he made observations which caused him to doubt the accepted published values for variations of the compass. Between 1586 and 1588, Hues travelled with Thomas Cavendish on a circumnavigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>globe,</b> performing astronomical observations and taking the latitudes of places they visited. Beginning in August 1591, Hues and Cavendish again set out on another circumnavigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>globe.</b> During the voyage, Hues made astronomical observations in the South Atlantic, and continued his observations of the variation of the compass at various latitudes and at the Equator. Cavendish died on the journey in 1592, and Hues returned to England the following year.|$|E

Recently, the group was involved in sending radios to Haiti so victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake could stay abreast of local disaster recovery efforts.|$|E
5|$|The {{captain of}} a sailing ship seeks a course along which the winds can be {{expected}} to blow in the direction of travel. During the Age of Sail, the pattern of prevailing winds made various points <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>globe</b> easy or difficult to access, and therefore had a direct effect on European empire-building and thus on modern political geography. For example, Manila galleons could not sail into the wind at all.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} {{agriculture}} records the domestication {{of plants and animals}} and the development and dissemination of techniques for raising them productively.

5|$|When BSkyB publicised their {{intentions}} {{to take over}} Manchester United, supporters reacted furiously to the news.

5|$|Agriculture began {{independently}} {{in different}} parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>globe,</b> and included a diverse range of taxa.

Pigs were domesticated in Mesopotamia around 11,000 BC. Sheep were domesticated in Mesopotamia between 11,000 and 9,000 BC. Cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs {{in the areas of}} modern Turkey and Pakistan around 8,500 BC. Camels were domesticated late, perhaps around 3,000 BC.|$|E

5|$|Although dragonflies are {{swift and}} agile fliers, some predators are {{fast enough to}} catch them. These include falcons such as the American kestrel, the merlin, and the hobby; nighthawks, swifts, flycatchers and {{swallows}} also take some adults; some species of wasps, too, prey on dragonflies, using them to provision their nests, laying an egg on each captured insect. In the water, various species of ducks and herons eat dragonfly larvae and they are also preyed on by newts, frogs, fish, and water spiders. Amur falcons, which migrate over the Indian Ocean at a period that coincides with the migration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>globe</b> skimmer dragonfly, Pantala flavescens, may actually be feeding on them while on the wing.|$|E

5|$|During the Age of Discovery in the 15th and 16th centuries, Portugal and Spain pioneered European {{exploration}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>globe,</b> and in {{the process}} established large overseas empires. Envious of the great wealth these empires generated, England, France, and the Netherlands began to establish colonies and trade networks of their own in the Americas and Asia. A series of wars in the 17th and 18th centuries with the Netherlands and France left England and then, following union between England and Scotland in 1707, Great Britain, the dominant colonial power in North America. It then became the dominant power in the Indian subcontinent after the East India Company's conquest of Mughal Bengal at the Battle of Plassey in 1757.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth's {{foreign policy}} was largely defensive. The {{exception}} was the English occupation of Le Havre from October 1562 to June 1563, {{which ended in}} failure when Elizabeth's Huguenot allies joined with the Catholics to retake the port. Elizabeth's intention had been to exchange Le Havre for Calais, lost to France in January 1558. Only through the activities of her fleets did Elizabeth pursue an aggressive policy. This paid off {{in the war against}} Spain, 80% of which was fought at sea. She knighted Francis Drake after his circumnavigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>globe</b> from 1577 to 1580, and he won fame for his raids on Spanish ports and fleets. An element of piracy and self-enrichment drove Elizabethan seafarers, over whom the queen had little control.|$|E
5|$|Filmmakers {{also made}} feature-length documentaries {{that covered the}} dark {{recesses}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>globe,</b> including the Amazon rainforest, Native American settlements, the Pacific islands, and everywhere in between. Taking advantage of audiences' voyeuristic impulses, aided by the allowance of nudity in tribal documentaries, the filming of lands untouched by modernity, and the presentation of locales never before filmed, these movies placated Depression era American audiences by showing them lifestyles more difficult than their own. Also captured were Arctic expeditions in films such 90° South and With Byrd at the South Pole, and Sub-Saharan Africa in the safari films of Martin and Osa Johnson, among others.|$|E

After arriving in Mexico in March 1908, the fleet spent three weeks conducting gunnery practice. The fleet then resumed its voyage up the Pacific coast of the Americas, stopping in San Francisco and Seattle before crossing the Pacific to Australia, stopping in Hawaii on the way. Stops in the South Pacific included Melbourne, Sydney, and Auckland.|$|E
