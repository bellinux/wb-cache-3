5|$|Several {{characteristics}} {{about the}} Tribune made the newspaper an excellent vehicle for Marx {{to reach a}} sympathetic public across the Atlantic Ocean. Since its founding, the Tribune had been an inexpensive newspaper—two cents per copy. Accordingly, it was popular with the broad masses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>working</b> <b>class</b> of the United States. With a run of about 50,000 issues, the Tribune was the most widely circulated journal in the United States. Editorially, the Tribune reflected Greeley's anti-slavery opinions. Not only did the Tribune have wide readership with the United States and not only did that readership come from the working classes, but the readers seemed {{to be from the}} progressive wing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>working</b> <b>class.</b> Marx's first article for the New York Tribune was on the British elections to Parliament and was published in the Tribune on 21 August 1852.|$|E
5|$|The American economy, however, {{does not}} require a labor force {{consisting}} solely of professionals. Instead it requires a greatly diverse and specialized labor force. Thus the majority of Americans complete assigned tasks with considerably less autonomy and creative freedom than professionals, leading to theory that they may better be described as being members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>working</b> <b>class.</b>|$|E

5|$|The other {{important}} contribution to Marx's revision of Hegelianism came from Engels's book, The Condition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Working</b> <b>Class</b> in England in 1844, which led Marx to conceive of the historical dialectic in terms of class conflict {{and to see the}} modern working class as the most progressive force for revolution.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the largest}} open spaces close to Manchester, the moor has a history of use for army {{manoeuvres}} and large public gatherings. In his book The Condition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Working</b> <b>Class</b> in England in 1844, Friedrich Engels referred to it as the Mons Sacer of Manchester. This was a reference to the hill to which the plebs (common citizens) of Rome withdrew en masse in 494 BC as an act of civil protest.|$|E

5|$|Horsefield founded {{one such}} society, the Prestwich Botanical Society, {{and was later}} {{president}} of a larger botanical society covering a wide area around north Manchester. He made several botanical discoveries and cultivated two new plants. A number of his writings about the working class and also some poetry were published, but nothing concerning botany other than {{in connection with the}} subject <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>working</b> <b>class.</b> He lived most of his life near Whitefield in Lancashire, in dire poverty.

5|$|In 1931, 9.4% of Wigan's {{population}} was middle class compared with 14% in England and Wales, and by 1971, this had increased to 12.4% compared with 24% nationally. Parallel to this {{slight increase in}} the middle classes of Wigan was the decline <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>working</b> <b>class</b> population. In 1931, 38.7% were working class compared with 36% in England and Wales; by 1971, this had decreased to 33.5% in Wigan and 26% nationwide. The rest of the {{population was}} made up of clerical workers and skilled manual workers or other miscellaneous. The slow decrease in the working class goes against the trend for a steeper national decline, reinforcing the perception of Wigan as a working-class town.|$|E
5|$|Manchester has {{a notable}} {{place in the}} history of Marxism and left-wing politics; being the subject of Friedrich Engels' work The Condition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Working</b> <b>Class</b> in England in 1844; Engels spent much of his life in and around Manchester, and when Karl Marx visited Manchester, they met at Chetham's Library. The {{economics}} books Marx was reading at the time {{can be seen in the}} library, as can the window seat where Marx and Engels would meet. The first Trades Union Congress was held in Manchester (at the Mechanics' Institute, David Street), from 2 to 6 June 1868. Manchester was an important cradle of the Labour Party and the Suffragette Movement.|$|E

5|$|Northern England, as {{the first}} area {{in the world to}} industrialise, was the birthplace of much modern {{political}} thought. Reports into the lives of the Northern working class, from Friedrich Engels' The Condition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Working</b> <b>Class</b> in England to George Orwell's The Road to Wigan Pier, shaped Marxism and, more generally, socialism. Meanwhile, enterprise and trade at the North's ports influenced the birth of Manchester Liberalism, a laissez-faire free trade philosophy. Expounded by C. P. Scott and the Manchester Guardian, the movement's greatest success was the repeal of the Corn Laws, protests against which had led to the 1819 Peterloo Massacre in Manchester.|$|E
5|$|On 28 August 1844, Marx met the German socialist Friedrich Engels at the Café de la Régence, {{beginning}} a lifelong friendship. Engels showed Marx his recently published The Condition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Working</b> <b>Class</b> in England in 1844, convincing Marx that {{the working class}} would be the agent and instrument of the final revolution in history. Soon, Marx and Engels were collaborating on a criticism of the philosophical ideas of Marx's former friend, Bruno Bauer. This work was published in 1845 as The Holy Family. Although critical of Bauer, Marx was increasingly influenced by {{the ideas of the}} Young Hegelians Max Stirner and Ludwig Feuerbach, but eventually Marx and Engels abandoned Feuerbachian materialism as well.|$|E
5|$|The plague {{was carried}} by fleas on sailing vessels {{returning}} from the ports of Asia, spreading quickly {{due to lack of}} proper sanitation: the population of England, then about 4.2 million, lost 1.4 million people to the bubonic plague. Florence's population was nearly halved in the year 1347. As a result of the decimation in the populace the value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>working</b> <b>class</b> increased, and commoners came to enjoy more freedom. To answer the increased need for labor, workers traveled in search of the most favorable position economically.|$|E

5|$|This {{perspective}} {{was accepted}} within the Fourth International, yet sowed {{the seeds for}} the split in 1953. At the Third World Congress, the sections agreed with the perspective of an international civil war. The French section disagreed with the associated tactic of entryism sui generis, and held that Pablo was underestimating the independent role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>working</b> <b>class</b> parties in the Fourth International. The leaders {{of the majority of}} the Trotskyist organisation in France, Marcel Bleibtreu and Pierre Lambert, refused to follow the line of the International. The International leadership had them replaced by a minority, leading to a permanent split in the French section.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, Berlin {{had been}} {{divided into four}} sectors {{controlled}} by the Allies: the US, the Soviet Union, Great Britain and France. The sector borders inside the city could in general be used freely for passage out of the German Democratic Republic, even after {{the border between the}} Federal Republic of Germany and the GDR had been continually closed off, starting in 1952. The outer border of West Berlin, which was also the border between West-Berlin and the GDR, had also been closed down in 1952. During the night of 12 to 13 August 1961 the National People's Army, the German Border Police, the Volkspolizei and the Combat Groups <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Working</b> <b>Class</b> locked down all passages between the Soviet sector and the three West sectors; construction of border protection facilities began.|$|E
5|$|Australia's {{working class}} culture also {{influenced}} {{that of the}} AIF. Approximately three-quarters of AIF volunteers were members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>working</b> <b>class,</b> with a high proportion also being trade unionists, and soldiers frequently applied their attitudes to industrial relations to the Army. Throughout the war there were incidents where soldiers refused to undertake tasks that they considered demeaning or protested against actual or perceived mistreatment by their officers. These actions were similar to the strikes many soldiers had taken part in during their pre-enlistment employment, with the men not seeing themselves as mutineers. The protests which occurred in 1918 over the planned disbandment of several battalions also used similar tactics to those employed in industrial disputes. Historian Nathan Wise has judged that the frequent use of industrial action in the AIF led to improved conditions for the soldiers, and contributed to it having a less strict military culture than was common in the British Army.|$|E

5|$|In February 1897, he {{was sentenced}} without trial to three years' exile in eastern Siberia. He was granted {{a few days in}} Saint Petersburg to put his affairs in order and used this time to meet with the Social-Democrats, who had renamed {{themselves}} the League of Struggle for the Emancipation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Working</b> <b>Class.</b> His journey to eastern Siberia took 11 weeks, for much of which he was accompanied by his mother and sisters. Deemed only a minor threat to the government, he was exiled to a peasant's hut in Shushenskoye, Minusinsky District, where he was kept under police surveillance; he was nevertheless able to correspond with other revolutionaries, many of whom visited him, and permitted to go on trips to swim in the Yenisei River and to hunt duck and snipe.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the east side, the central and west neighborhoods originally contained many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>working</b> <b>class</b> Germans who settled the town. Development {{on the west side}} started in the 1850s with extensive construction occurring in the 1870s. Housing was mostly one and a half to two story front gable American Foursquare and simplified Queen Anne style. The central Hamburg neighborhood contains the most architecturally significant residences in the old German neighborhoods. Also in central Davenport, the Vander Veer Park Historic District is a neighborhood anchored by Vander Veer Park, a large park with a botanical garden and a fountain. The park was modeled after New York City's Central Park and originally shared its name. Vander Veer is surrounded by large Queen Anne and Tudor Revival style houses that were built between 1895 and 1915. Development of the Vander Veer Park {{was one of the first}} major beautification efforts.|$|E
5|$|Nationwide strikes {{broke out}} {{in the spring and summer}} of 1988. They were much weaker than the strikes of 1980 and were {{discontinued}} after the intervention by Wałęsa, who secured the regime's commitment to begin negotiations with the opposition. The strikes were the last act of active political involvement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>working</b> <b>class</b> in the history of People's Poland and were led by young workers, not connected to Solidarity veterans and opposed to socially harmful consequences of the economic restructuring in progress at that time. According to the researcher Maciej Gdula, the political activity that followed was conducted exclusively by the elites. It was neither inspired by nor consulted with any mass social organization or movement, as the opposition leading circles freed themselves from their strong in the past commitment to the welfare of working people. No longer secure as undisputed leaders, Polish dissidents of the KOR-Solidarity generations were eager to bargain with the weakened regime whose economic goals they now shared.|$|E
