5|$|The {{advent of}} cheaper Mexican {{cochineal}} {{led to an}} abrupt slump in the Polish cochineal trade, and the 1540s saw a steep decline in quantities of the red dye exported from Poland. In 1547, Polish cochineal disappeared from the Poznań customs registry; a Volhynian clerk noted in 1566 that the dye no longer paid in Gdańsk. Perennial knawel plantations were replaced with cereal fields or pastures for raising cattle. Polish cochineal, which until then was mostly an export product, continued to be used locally by the peasants who collected it; it was employed not only for dyeing fabric {{but also as a}} vodka colorant, an ingredient in folk medicine, <b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>for</b> decorative coloring of horses' tails.|$|E
5|$|The dragon man was {{believed}} to act similar to the mythological dragon: {{as soon as he}} saw bad weather approaching, which he knew was brought by an ala, he would leave whatever he was doing, and fly up to confront the demon. This he did by falling into a deep sleep, or entering a state similar to death, usually at the very spot where he happened to be at that time. His soul then left his body in the form of a snake or a lizard, and soared skywards. It was claimed that he was not breathing as long as his soul was absent from his body. The battle could last for a whole day, <b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>for</b> several days, during which time the man lay unconscious, sweating profusely from the exertion of the fight. There was a danger that, during the course of the battle, the ala might approach the man's body and harm him, which could be prevented by someone swinging a blade above him, or by sticking the blade at the lying man's head. He should not be pushed or moved while in this state: if he was not in the same position as when he fell asleep, his soul would not be able to return into his body, and he would die. When he woke up after the battle with the ala, he was very tired. Apart from these characteristics, the dragon man was seen as an ordinary human.|$|E

25|$|The magistrate, {{as in the}} inquisitorial {{system of}} {{continental}} European law, was both prosecutor and judge. He decided which cases to accept, directed the gathering of evidence and witnesses,then conducted the trial, {{including the use of}} torture. The magistrate was the sole judge of guilt or innocence and determined the punishment or compensation. Still, his decisions could be reviewed by higher officials, even up to the emperor in capital cases. Since he could be reprimanded for not investigating thoroughly, for not following correct procedure, <b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>for</b> writing the wrong character, magistrates in later dynasties hired specialized clerks or secretaries who had expertise in the law and bureaucratic requirements.|$|E
25|$|Wood from mature giant sequoias {{is highly}} {{resistant}} to decay, {{but due to}} being fibrous and brittle, it is generally unsuitable for construction. From the 1880s through the 1920s, logging took place in many groves in spite of marginal commercial returns. The Hume-Bennett Lumber Company {{was the last to}} harvest giant sequoia, going out of business in 1924. Due to their weight and brittleness, trees would often shatter when they hit the ground, wasting much of the wood. Loggers attempted to cushion the impact by digging trenches and filling them with branches. Still, as little as 50% of the timber is estimated to have made it from groves to the mill. The wood was used mainly for shingles and fence posts, <b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>for</b> matchsticks.|$|E

25|$|Another {{argument}} Al-Khoei {{brings up}} {{in favor of}} the Quran is that by the time ‘Uthman became caliph, Islam had spread {{to such an extent that}} it was impossible for him, <b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>for</b> anyone more powerful than him, to remove anything from the Quran. The value and importance of the Quran during this time protected it from being altered. In the oral culture at this time, people paid great attention to memorizing pre-Islamic Arabic poetry, it is hard to imagine that they did not pay similar attention to the preservation of the Book of the Almighty, especially since they believed they would be rewarded in the hereafter for memorizing it. Uthman could have altered the text, but he would have been unable to remove the Quran from the hearts of the Muslims who had memorized it.|$|E
25|$|Once a {{separator}} theorem of {{this type}} is shown, {{it can be used}} to produce a separator hierarchy for n-vertex planar graphs that again does not depend on the graph structure: the tree-decomposition formed from this hierarchy has width O(√n) and can be used for any planar graph. The set of all pairs of vertices in this tree-decomposition that both belong to a common node of the tree-decomposition forms a trivially perfect graph with O(n3/2) vertices that contains every n-vertex planar graph as a subgraph. A similar construction shows that bounded-degree planar graphs have universal graphs with O(nnbsp&lognbsp&n) edges, where the constant hidden in the O notation depends on the degree bound. Any universal graph for planar graphs (<b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>for</b> trees of unbounded degree) must have Ω(nnbsp&lognbsp&n) edges, but it remains unknown whether this lower bound or the O(n3/2) upper bound is tight for universal graphs for arbitrary planar graphs.|$|E
25|$|In {{the winter}} half year, {{the air on}} the Swiss Plateau can stay still, with little {{exchange}} to rest of the atmosphere, building a lake of cold air on the plateau and often a ceiling of high fog. The clouds look like an ocean of fog when seen from above, (usually around 800m) and hence is called the 'nebelmeer'. This weather is called inversion because the temperature below the fog {{is lower than the}} temperature above. Sometimes, it lasts for days <b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>for</b> weeks, during which the neighbouring regions of the Alps and the Jura can have the brightest sunshine. Typical for the high fog is the bise, a cold wind from northeast. Since it is channelled by the Swiss Plateau narrowing in southwest, it reaches its major strength in the lake Geneva region where wind speeds of 60km/h with top speeds of more than 100km/h are usual in typical bise weather. The regions near the Alps of the central and eastern plateau sometimes have temperature rises due to the warm foehn wind.|$|E

500|$|The current {{consensus}} held {{by historians}} such as S.

500|$|With the {{establishment}} of the Ottoman empire, many Turkish name changes have continued to retain their Greek origins.
