There is still a fairly large agricultural workforce and in light industry or service industries, although many people commute to surrounding cities for work. According to the 2011 Census the valley has a population of approximately 5,000, largely living in one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dozen</b> or so villages and in isolated farms and hamlets. The average age of the population is 42 years, with unemployment rates of 1–4% of all economically active people aged 16–74, however these figures are approximations because the ward areas covered and described in the census statistics do not relate exactly to the area of the valley. In the Indices of deprivation 2010 all of the areas within the valley were considered to be in the most affluent third in England.|$|E
5|$|The club won {{its first}} FA Cup in 1887, under the {{captaincy}} of another Scotsman, Archie Hunter. They beat West Bromwich Albion 2–0 {{in the final}} held at The Oval. Up until 1885, football had remained an amateur sport. It turned professional in 1885, when the FA legalized professional football, but with a national wage limit. However, the Scottish draper and director of Aston Villa, William McGregor had become frustrated with watching his team in one-sided friendly matches and low attendances for all games but FA Cup ties. He saw {{that in order to}} keep interest in the game alive, the top teams needed to play each other in a league much like American baseball teams did. McGregor wrote to the twelve leading clubs in England proposing the formation of a league, what would later be known as the English Football League. Aston Villa were one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dozen</b> teams that competed in the inaugural Football League in 1888. Villa's first League game came on 8 September 1888, when they drew 1–1 Wolverhampton Wanderers as Tom Green scored the club's first League goal. Villa finished runners-up to Preston North End in that inaugural season.|$|E

500|$|The Master of the Rolls was {{initially}} a clerk responsible {{for keeping the}} [...] "Rolls", or records, of the Court of Chancery, and {{was known as the}} Keeper of the Rolls of Chancery. The Keeper was the most senior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dozen</b> Chancery clerks, and as such occasionally acted as keeper of the Great Seal of the Realm. The post evolved into a judicial one as the Court of Chancery did; the first reference to judicial duties dates from 1520. With the Judicature Act 1873, which merged the Court of Chancery with the other major courts, the Master of the Rolls joined the Chancery Division of the High Court and the Court of Appeal, but left the Chancery Division by the terms of the Judicature Act 1881. He retained his clerical functions as the nominal head of the Public Record Office until the Public Records Act 1958 transferred responsibility for it to the Lord Chancellor; the Master of the Rolls had also been warden of the little-used Domus Conversorum for housing Jewish coverts, which led to the house and chapel being used to store legal documents and later becoming the location of the Public Record Office. [...] One residual reminder of this role {{is the fact that the}} Master of the Rolls of the day continues to serve, ex officio, as President of the British Records Association. The Master of the Rolls was also previously responsible for registering solicitors, the officers of the Senior Courts.|$|E

The {{building}} {{was located in}} what had once been a fashionable part of town, but by 1889, when Addams was searching for a location for her experiment, it had descended into squalor. This was partly due to the rapid and overwhelming influx of immigrants into the Near West Side neighborhood. Charles Hull granted his former home to his niece Helen Culver, who in turn granted it to Addams on a 25-year rent-free lease. By 1907, Addams had acquired 13 buildings surrounding Hull's mansion. [...] Between 1889 and 1935, Addams and Ellen Gates Starr continuously redeveloped the building. [...] In 1912, the Bowen Country Club summer camp was added to complete the Hull House complex. [...] The facility remained at the original location until it was purchased in 1963 by what was then called the University of Illinois-Circle Campus. [...] The development of University of Illinois-Circle Campus required the demolition of most of the Hull House buildings and the 1967 restoration to the original building by Frazier, Raftery, Orr and Fairbank removed Addams's third floor addition. [...] In addition to the mansion, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dozen</b> additional buildings only the craftsman style dining hall (built in 1905 and designed by Pond & Pond) survives and it was moved [...] from its original site to be next to the mansion.|$|E
