25|$|Scary was {{a village}} in the {{northern}} part of the Eastfarthing at the southern feet of the Hills <b>of</b> <b>Scary.</b> A road ran south from Scary to cross the Water at Budgeford and join the Great East Road at Whitfurrows. During the War of the Ring, provisions were stored in the quarry east <b>of</b> <b>Scary</b> by the Chief's Men, and after the Scouring of the Shire the Hobbits took advantage of these stores for the Yule holiday.|$|E

25|$|Almost {{everyone}} I've {{talked to}} says, 'We're gonna move to Houston.' What I'm hearing, {{which is sort}} <b>of</b> <b>scary,</b> is {{they all want to}} stay in Texas... Everybody is so overwhelmed by the hospitality, and so many {{of the people in the}} arenas here, you know, were underprivileged anyway, so this (as she chuckles slightly) is working very well for them.|$|E
25|$|As it was {{the first}} game on a new console, the {{development}} team was largely made up of people new to the series, including designers Akira Ohtani and Yuki Sakamoto. The capacity of the Wii U meant that more experimentation with graphics could be done. During the making of the game, the team watched a lot <b>of</b> <b>scary</b> online videos, along with studying lighting and the appearance of being wet. Alongside making a game for dedicated series players, they also added adjustments for new players, partly due to the multimedia developments that were underway. Among these changes were adding helpful gameplay features and creating more conversation cutscenes to make the story easier to understand. The pace of gameplay was also made similar to an action game as opposed to previous entries. In addition, the flashback cutscenes were made to look grainy and low-quality compared to the present-day cutscenes. While they had initially been visually similar to rest of the game, part of the series' appeal was the fear evoked by unseen objects, so they added distortions. The shift onto more powerful hardware also enabled the team to incorporate more graphic scenes, which contributed to it receiving a higher CERO rating than previous titles. A mechanic being tested in the game was the necessity to keep dry, initially inspired by the sweating mechanic from Dead or Alive 5. While this was toned down, dampness being tied to the character's well being remained in the game as both a story and gameplay concept. This aspect was suggested by Ohtani.|$|E

500|$|... "Treehouse of Horror XXII" [...] is {{the third}} episode of the twenty-third season and the twenty-second Halloween episode of the American {{animated}} sitcom The Simpsons. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on October 30, 2011. The episode {{is part of the}} Treehouse of Horror series, which is an episode divided into three separate stories and an opening that is a parody <b>of</b> <b>scary</b> or Halloween themed stories. This episode's stories were primarily spoofs of the French film The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, the television series Dexter, and the American film Avatar. The opening was a parody of the autobiographical film 127 Hours, in which the subject Aron Ralston loses an arm.|$|E
500|$|Dylan Sprouse {{has stated}} that the {{experience}} of coming to fame after the success of The Suite Life of Zack & Cody is [...] "kind <b>of</b> <b>scary,</b> how fast everything is moving" [...] and that a year prior [...] "none of this was happening, it was just doing Suite Life", and that he was excited for the future. While filming The Suite Life of Zack & Cody, the both of them received on-set tutoring for three hours each day for school, and said they were getting [...] "straight A's and honors". In their last year of high school, the brothers both took Advanced Placement classes. Dylan took AP Psychology and AP Spanish, and Cole took AP Psychology and AP Government.|$|E
500|$|No [...] "John Doe #2" [...] {{was ever}} identified, nothing {{conclusive}} was ever reported regarding {{the owner of}} the unmatched leg, and the government never openly investigated anyone else in conjunction with the bombing. Although the defense teams in both McVeigh's and Nichols trials suggested that others were involved, Judge Steven W. Taylor found no credible, relevant, or legally admissible evidence, of anyone other than McVeigh and Nichols having directly participated in the bombing. When McVeigh was asked if there were other conspirators in the bombing, he replied: [...] "You can't handle the truth! Because the truth is, I blew up the Murrah Building, and isn't it kind <b>of</b> <b>scary</b> that one man could wreak this kind of hell?" [...] On the morning of McVeigh's execution a letter was released in which he had written [...] "For those die-hard conspiracy theorists who will refuse to believe this, I turn the tables and say: Show me where I needed anyone else. Financing? Logistics? Specialized tech skills? Brainpower? Strategy? ... Show me where I needed a dark, mysterious 'Mr. X'!" ...|$|E

500|$|Many critics {{consider}} the episode {{one of the}} strongest during Tennant's time as the Doctor. IGN's Matt Wales named it the sixth best episode of Tennant's tenure, while Sam McPherson of TVOvermind listed it as the second best Tenth Doctor episode. In 2011, before {{the second half of the}} sixth series, The Huffington Post labelled [...] "Blink" [...] as one of the five essential episodes for new viewers to watch. The Weeping Angels also received critical praise. In 2009 SFX named the climax with the Weeping Angels advancing on Sally and Larry the scariest moment in Doctor Who history, describing it as [...] "a terrifying combination <b>of</b> <b>scary</b> concept and perfect direction". The Weeping Angels came in at number three in Neil Gaiman's [...] "Top Ten New Classic Monsters" [...] in Entertainment Weekly, while TV Squad named them the third scariest television characters. They were also rated the third [...] "baddie" [...] in Doctor Who by The Daily Telegraph, behind the Nestene Consciousness and Daleks. In 2009 SFX listed the Angels in their list of favourite things of the revival of Doctor Who, writing, [...] "Scariest. Monsters. Ever." ...|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Angelica Jade Bastién, {{writing for}} RogerEbert.com, said, [...] "For {{all of its}} wondrous world-building and trippy effects, Doctor Strange isn't the {{evolutionary}} step forward for Marvel {{that it needs to}} be storytelling-wise. Underneath all of its improvements, the core narrative is something we've seen countless times." [...] Mara Reinstein of US Weekly called the film [...] "joyless" [...] and wrote, [...] "Despite [...] alluring powers, he can't save an overly convoluted film that relies on a galaxy of derivative 3-D special-effect tricks... Nobody is having much fun here — save for the doctor's Cloak of Levitation that has its own devilish personality and can whisk him out <b>of</b> <b>scary</b> situations." [...] Rex Reed of the New York Observer called Doctor Strange [...] "an awkwardly cliché-riddled mix of hamstrung imagination and bizarro reality" [...] and said, [...] "None of it makes any sense... For characterization, dialogue, narrative arc, acceptable acting and coherence, go elsewhere." [...] Adam Graham of The Detroit News said, [...] "Cumberbatch is wildly charismatic in the lead role... But that’s the thing: He’s a better party guest than he is a host. Doctor Strange is a fine introduction, but by the end, you’re not sad to be headed for the door." ...|$|E
500|$|Part of the {{attraction}} for the writers {{is that they}} are able to break the rules and include violence that would not make a regular episode. In some cases, the writers will have an idea that is too violent and far-fetched or too short for a normal episode, but {{can be used as a}} segment in the seasonal special. Several of the writers, former executive producer David Mirkin among them, believe that the episodes should be scary and not just funny. [...] "Treehouse of Horror V" [...] has been described by Mirkin as being one of [...] "the most intense, disturbing Halloween show ever" [...] as it was filled with violence and gore in response to new censorship rules. Earlier [...] "Treehouse of Horror" [...] episodes began with Marge issuing a disclaimer that [...] "if you have sensitive children, maybe you should tuck them into bed early tonight instead of writing us angry letters tomorrow." [...] However, these episodes seem mild compared to the carnage that followed in later episodes, according to Jean, who calls it [...] "a societal thing". [...] He points out that his 10-year-old daughter loves films like Coraline, and that, [...] " [...] the age <b>of</b> <b>scary</b> stories [...] appropriateness has gotten lower." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{principal}} photography {{produced a}} high demand for extras as zombies. In {{an interview with}} MTV News, special effects artist Greg Nicotero stated that while anyone was welcome to audition, the producers of the show were looking specifically for people who possessed exceptional height and thin features. Casting for extras took approximately three days. Once accepted, the extras {{would be sent to}} [...] "zombie school" [...] for training and preparing for filming. Nicotero stated that [...] "it was interesting because I initially thought my experience with zombie movies is you just let them do whatever they want to do. George [...] always said, 'You show 50 people one movement, then you have 50 people doing all the same thing.' So we sort of just lined them up and said, 'Let's see what your zombie walk would look like,' and then they would do it and we would say, 'Try this or try that.' You know, sort of fine tuning everybody." [...] Alongside with Darabont, Nicotero had previously collaborated with Romero on several occasions, and looked at the structure of the zombies in his films for inspiration. [...] "It's not that I'm against [...] It's just not what I grew up with. It's interesting, too, because a couple takes we did, where a couple of the zombies kind of broke into a run, and after one take Frank's like, 'Did they run too fast? They shouldn't be running. Slow them down.' This is trying to be creepy and moody and, you know, you're building up all this kind <b>of</b> <b>scary</b> tension." ...|$|E
2500|$|Colloquially, {{the term}} [...] "ghost story" [...] {{can refer to}} any kind <b>of</b> <b>scary</b> story. In a {{narrower}} sense, the ghost story has been developed as a short story format, within genre fiction. It {{is a form of}} supernatural fiction and specifically of weird fiction, and is often a horror story.|$|E
2500|$|The public's {{first taste}} <b>of</b> <b>Scary</b> Monsters was [...] "Ashes to Ashes", which was {{released}} {{as a single}} one month prior to the album and made No. 1 in the UK.

Aside from its critical and commercial success as a song, the accompanying music video set a benchmark for the art form.|$|E
