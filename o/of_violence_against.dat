5|$|Feminist {{views of}} {{pornography}} range from condemnation of pornography {{as a form}} <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> women, to an embracing of some forms of pornography as a medium of feminist expression. Feminists' views on prostitution vary, {{but many of these}} perspectives can be loosely arranged into an overarching standpoint that is generally either critical or supportive of prostitution and sex work.|$|E
5|$|In {{matters of}} self-defence, {{different}} interpretations of ancient Hindu texts have been offered.

Ahimsa {{is not meant to}} imply pacifism.|$|E

5|$|Lépine's {{actions have}} been {{variously}} ascribed to psychiatric diagnoses such as personality disorder, psychosis, or attachment disorder, or societal {{factors such as}} poverty, isolation, powerlessness, and violence in the media.

5|$|Andrea Rita Dworkin (September 26, 1946– April 9, 2005) was an American radical {{feminist and}} writer {{best known for}} her {{criticism}} of pornography, which she argued was linked to rape and other forms <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> women. Her views were widely criticized by liberal feminists and others. At the same time, she maintained a dialogue with political conservatives, and wrote a topically-related book, Right-Wing Women. After suffering abuse from her first husband, she was introduced to radical feminist literature, and began writing Woman Hating. Coming to New York, she became an activist on several issues and a writer, eventually publishing 10 books on feminism.|$|E
5|$|Georgetown University student {{organizations}} {{include a}} {{diverse array of}} groups focused on social justice issues, including organizations run through both Student Affairs and the Center for Social Justice. Oriented against gender violence, Take Back the Night coordinates an annual rally and march to protest against rape and other forms <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> women. Georgetown Solidarity Committee is a workers' rights organization whose successes include ending use of sweatshops in producing Georgetown-logoed apparel, and garnering pay raises for both university cleaning staff and police.

5|$|Hosseini has {{commented that}} he {{considers}} The Kite Runner to be a father–son story, emphasizing the familial {{aspects of the}} narrative, an element that he continued to use in his later works. Themes of guilt and redemption feature prominently in the novel, with a pivotal scene depicting an act <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> Hassan that Amir fails to prevent. The {{latter half of the}} book centers on Amir's attempts to atone for this transgression by rescuing Hassan's son over two decades later.|$|E
5|$|Inclined {{to form an}} {{alliance}} with the Habsburgs (and even give up the Polish crown to pursue his ambitions in Sweden), Sigismund conducted secret negotiations with them and married Archduchess Anna. Accused by Zamoyski of breaking his covenants, Sigismund III was humiliated during the sejm of 1592, which deepened his resentment of szlachta. Sigismund was bent on strengthening {{the power of the}} monarchy and Counter-Reformational promotion of the Catholic Church (Piotr Skarga was among his supporters). Indifferent to the increasingly common breaches of the Warsaw Confederation religious protections and instances <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> the Protestants, the King was opposed by religious minorities.|$|E
5|$|Like much of Tamil Nadu, Tiruchirappalli remains {{prone to}} {{communal}} tensions based {{on religion and}} ethnicity. There have been occasional outbreaks <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> Sri Lankans. In 2009, the offices of a Sri Lankan airline were attacked in the city. In September 2012, two groups of Sri Lankan pilgrims who had visited the Basilica of Our Lady of Good Health in Velankanni and the Poondi Madha Basilica had their buses attacked in Tiruchirappalli {{by a group of}} Tamil activists. Owing to a series of terrorist attacks in Indian cities since 2000, security has been increased at sites such as Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple.|$|E

5|$|Filming {{occurred}} during October and November 1998 in the Dallas, Texas area. The producers initially wanted to film in Falls City, Nebraska, where the real-life events had taken place; however, budget constraints meant that principal photography had {{to occur in}} Texas. The film's cinematography uses dim and artificial lighting throughout and was influenced {{by a variety of}} styles, including neorealism and the films of Martin Scorsese, while the soundtrack consisted primarily of country, blues, and rock music from the film. The film's themes, which have been explored by many scholars, include the nature of romantic and platonic relationships, the causes <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> LGBT people, transgender people and the gender binary, and the relationship among social class, race, and gender.|$|E
5|$|Belgium {{continued}} to rule Ruanda-Urundi (of which Rwanda formed the northern part) as a UN Trust Territory after the Second World War, with {{a mandate to}} oversee eventual independence. Tension escalated between the Tutsi, who favoured early independence, and the Hutu emancipation movement, culminating in the 1959 Rwandan Revolution: Hutu activists began killing Tutsi and destroying their houses, forcing more than 100,000 people to seek refuge in neighbouring countries. In 1961, the suddenly pro-Hutu Belgians held a referendum in which the country voted to abolish the monarchy. Rwanda was separated from Burundi and gained independence in 1962. Cycles of violence followed, with exiled Tutsi attacking from neighbouring countries and the Hutu retaliating with large-scale slaughter and repression of the Tutsi. In 1973, Juvénal Habyarimana took power in a military coup. Pro-Hutu discrimination continued, but there was greater economic prosperity and a reduced amount <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> Tutsi. The Twa remained marginalised, and by 1990 were almost entirely {{forced out of the}} forests by the government; many became beggars. Rwanda's population had increased from 1.6million people in 1934 to 7.1million in 1989, leading to competition for land.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, {{the leader}} of the North Carolina branch of the CPUSA, Junius Scales, became the final CPUSA member convicted under the Smith Act, and the only one convicted after the Yates decision. Prosecutors pursued Scales' case because he {{specifically}} advocated violent political action and gave demonstrations of martial arts skills. Scales was accused of violating the membership clause of the Smith Act, not the clause prohibiting advocacy <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> the government. In his appeal to the Supreme Court, Scales contended that the 1950 McCarran Internal Security Act rendered the Smith Act's membership clause ineffective, because the McCarran Act explicitly stated that membership in a communist party does not constitute a per se violation of any criminal statute. In 1961, the Supreme Court, in a 5–4 decision, upheld Scales' conviction, finding that the Smith Act membership clause was not obviated by the McCarran Act, because the Smith Act required prosecutors to prove first, that there was direct advocacy of violence; and second, that the defendant's membership was substantial and active, not merely passive or technical. Two Justices of the Supreme Court who had supported the Yates decision in 1957, Harlan and Frankfurter, voted to uphold Scales' conviction.|$|E

5|$|Lenin tasked Trotsky with {{establishing}} a Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, {{and with his}} support, Trotsky organised a Revolutionary Military Council in September 1918, remaining its chairman until 1925. Recognising their valuable military experience, Lenin agreed that officers from the old Tsarist army could serve in the Red Army, although Trotsky established military councils to monitor their activities. The Reds held control of Russia's two largest cities, Moscow and Petrograd, {{as well as most}} of Great Russia, while the Whites were located largely on the former Empire's peripheries. The latter were therefore hindered by being both fragmented and geographically scattered, and because their ethnic Russian supremacism alienated the region's national minorities. Anti-Bolshevik armies carried out the White Terror, a campaign <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> perceived Bolshevik supporters which was typically more spontaneous than the state-sanctioned Red Terror. Both White and Red Armies were responsible for attacks against Jewish communities, prompting Lenin to issue a condemnation of anti-Semitism, blaming prejudice against Jews on capitalist propaganda.|$|E
5|$|On 13 February 2008, {{the state}} government, which {{was accused of}} {{reluctance}} to take immediate action, ultimately arrested Raj Thackeray and Abu Asim Azmi (a local SP leader) on charges of instigation of violence and causing communal disturbance. Although released that same day, a gag order was imposed on both leaders {{to prevent them from}} making further inflammatory remarks. Meanwhile, tensions in Maharashtra rose as the news of Raj's possible arrest, and his subsequent actual arrest, angered his supporters. Incidences <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> North Indians and their property by MNS workers were reported in Mumbai, Pune, Aurangabad, Beed, Nashik, Amravati, Jalna, and Latur. Nearly 25,000 North Indian workers fled Pune, and another 15,000 fled Nashik {{in the wake of the}} attacks. The exodus of workers caused an acute labour shortage, affecting local industries. Analysts estimated financial losses of –. Although the violence receded after the arrests of the two leaders, sporadic attacks were reported until May 2008. After months of lull, on 19 October 2008, MNS activists beat up North Indian candidates appearing for the all-India Railway Recruitment Board entrance exam in Mumbai. The incident led to Raj's arrest and fresh violence. Later on 28 October 2008 a labourer from Uttar Pradesh was lynched in a Mumbai commuter train.|$|E
5|$|The October 1990 {{invasion}} started {{well for}} the RPF, but suffered a reversal when Fred Rwigyema was killed in action on the second day. The FAR, assisted by troops sent from France, gained the upper hand and the RPF were largely defeated {{by the end of}} October. Paul Kagame took command of the demoralised RPF troops, withdrawing to the Virunga mountains for several months before restarting the war. The RPF began a classic hit-and-run style guerrilla war, which continued until. mid-1992 with neither side able to gain the upper hand. The war led to a resurgence <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>against</b> Tutsi in Rwanda, as well as the token introduction of multi-party politics. A series of escalating protests in mid-1992 forced Habyarimana to begin peace negotiations. This was a complex process involving his government, the RPF, the official opposition, and a group of Hutu hardliners. These hardliners opposed the peace process and disrupted the negotiations. They then initiated a massive wave of killings in early 1993, prompting Paul Kagame to launch a fresh offensive and bring the RPF to the verge of taking the capital, Kigali. Kagame decided not to storm the capital, however, and the two sides returned to the negotiating table with the RPF enjoying a strengthened hand.|$|E
