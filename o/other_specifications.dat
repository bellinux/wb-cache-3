5|$|The {{technological}} design advances made by Whipple and Murphy, {{in addition}} to further advances in steel and iron fabrication, made wrought iron truss bridges a major industry in the United States. The Capon Lake bridge was a Whipple–Murphy truss bridge, since it incorporated Murphy's later modifications with double-intersections and horizontal chords. At {{the time of the}} bridge's original fabrication in 1874, metal truss bridges were ordered from catalogs by county courts and other entities responsible for transportation construction and maintenance. These entities provided the desired width, length, and <b>other</b> <b>specifications,</b> and the truss materials were shipped to the construction site and assembled by local construction teams. Metal truss bridges were more economically feasible, could span longer distances, and were simpler to construct than stone bridges, and they were more durable than wooden bridges. They were also marketed as detachable and transportable structures that could be dismantled and reassembled. The technology used in the Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge revolutionized transport throughout West Virginia. While the Whipple truss bridge had waned in popularity by the 1890s, the bridges were commonly disassembled and re-erected for use on secondary roads, {{as was the case with}} the Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge in 1938.|$|E

25|$|The updated 2014 Proton Prevé {{was quietly}} {{introduced}} into the Malaysian market in November 2013. All Prevé variants on sale in Malaysia are now equipped standard with all engineered safety features, bringing them up to 5-Star ANCAP specifications and thus placing them on par with the Australian market Proton Prevé. Proton launched a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) variant of the Prevé exclusively for Thailand in early 2014. The Prevé LPG is fitted with a dedicated 58-litre tank in the boot and a fuel gauge module on the dashboard, {{as well as a}} separate inlet inside the petrol filler compartment. Both the CamPro IAFM+ and CFE engines have been modified to run on both LPG and E20 petrol. All <b>other</b> <b>specifications</b> remain unchanged over the launch models, and the Prevé LPG is priced between 664,000 and 798,000 baht, whereas the regular Prevé continues on sale between 625,000 and 759,000 baht respectively.|$|E

2500|$|Adjustable control: The audio circuit is analog with {{electronic}} components {{that can be}} adjusted. The hearing professional determines the gain and <b>other</b> <b>specifications</b> required for the wearer, and then adjusts the analog components either with small controls on the hearing aid itself or by having a laboratory build the hearing aid to meet those specifications. After the adjustment the resulting audio does not change any further, other than overall loudness that the wearer adjusts with a volume control. This type of circuitry is generally the least flexible.

40|$|Abstract. The Object Constraint Language (OCL) offers {{so-called}} nondeterministic constructs {{which are}} often only poorly understood even by OCL experts. They are widely ignored in the OCL literature, their semantics given in the official language description of OCL is ill-defined, and none of today’s OCL tools support them in a consistent way. The source of the poor understanding and ill-defined semantics is, as identified in this paper, OCL’s attempt to adopt the concept of nondeterminism from <b>other</b> <b>specification</b> languages with fundamentally different semantical foundations. While this insight helps to improve the understanding of non-deterministic constructs it also shows {{that there are some}} formidable obstacles for their integration into OCL. However, in some cases, non-deterministic constructs can be read as abbreviations for more complex deterministic constructs and can help to formulate a specification in a more understandable way. Thus, we suggest to integrate non-deterministic constructs in <b>other</b> <b>specification</b> languages such as Z, JML, Eiffel whose semantical foundations {{are similar to those of}} OCL. ...|$|R
