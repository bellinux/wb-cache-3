5|$|In Wicca, salt is {{symbolic}} of the element Earth. It is also believed to cleanse an area of harmful or negative energies. A dish <b>of</b> <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> a dish of water are almost always present on an altar, and salt is used {{in a wide variety}} of rituals and ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|Multiple Aboriginal {{villages in}} {{frontier}} areas rebelled against the Dutch in the 1650s due to oppression {{such as when}} the Dutch ordered aboriginal women for sex, deer pelts, and rice be given to them from aborigines in the Taipei basin in Wu-lao-wan village which sparked a rebellion in December 1652 {{at the same time}} as the Chinese rebellion. Two Dutch translators were beheaded by the Wu-lao-wan aborigines and in a subsequent fight 30 aboriginals and another two Dutch people died, after an embargo <b>of</b> <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> iron on Wu-lao-wan the aboriginals were forced to sue for peace in February 1653.|$|E
5|$|Salt {{has long}} held an {{important}} place in religion and culture. At {{the time of}} Brahmanic sacrifices, in Hittite rituals and during festivals held by Semites and Greeks {{at the time of}} the new moon, salt was thrown into a fire where it produced crackling noises. The ancient Egyptians, Greeks and Romans invoked their gods with offerings <b>of</b> <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> water and some people think this to be the origin of Holy Water in the Christian faith. In Aztec mythology, Huixtocihuatl was a fertility goddess who presided over salt and salt water.|$|E

5|$|Given that liver AVMs {{generally}} cause high-output cardiac failure, {{the emphasis}} is on treating this with diuretics to reduce the circulating blood volume, restriction <b>of</b> <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> fluid intake, and antiarrhythmic agents in case of irregular heart beat. This may be sufficient in treating the symptoms of swelling and breathlessness. If this treatment is not effective or leads to side effects or complications, the only remaining option is liver transplantation. This is reserved for those with severe symptoms, as it carries a mortality of about 10%, but leads to good results if successful. The exact point at which liver transplantion is to be offered is not yet completely established. Embolization treatment has been attempted, but leads to severe complications in a proportion of patients and is discouraged.|$|E
5|$|Watchet {{developed}} as a town thanks to its closeness to the minerals within the Brendon Hills, and its access to the River Severn for onward shipping. Aside from local ships plying trade across the river, from 1564 onwards the port was used for import <b>of</b> <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> wine from France. In 1643 during the English Civil War, a Royalist ship was sent to Watchet to reinforce for the siege of Dunster Castle. Parliamentarian (Roundhead) Captain Popham ordered his troops into the sea with the tide on the ebb, and with the ship unable to move, attacked the ship with fire from their carbines. Taken by surprise and under heavy attack, the Royalist commander surrendered the ship, resulting in a ship technically at sea being captured by troops on horseback.|$|E
5|$|After {{the tumultuous}} An Lushan Rebellion (755–763), the early Tang career path of {{officials}} rising in {{a hierarchy of}} six ministries—with Works given the lowest status and Personnel the highest—was changed into a system where officials chose specialized careers within {{one of the six}} ministries. The commissions <b>of</b> <b>Salt</b> <b>and</b> Iron, Funds, and Census that were created to deal with immediate financial crisis after An Lushan's insurrection were the influential basis for this change in career paths that became focused within functionally distinct hierarchies. The varied career backgrounds and expertise of early Northern Song officials meant that they were to be given specific assignment to work in only one of the ministries: Personnel, Revenue, Rites, War, Justice, or Works. As China's population increased and regional economies became more complex the central government could no longer handle the separate parts of the empire efficiently. As a result of this, in 1082 the reorganization of the central bureaucracy scrapped the hierarchies of commissions in favor of the early Tang model of officials advancing through a hierarchy of ministries, each with different levels of prestige.|$|E

40|$|In total {{parenteral}} nutrition (TPN) ​, esp. {{in the case}} of preterm infants, simultaneous administration of vitamins and trace elements is still a problematic issue: guidelines put in evidence the lack of specific documentation. In this work NMR spectroscopy was applied to the study of vitamins (pyridoxine hydrochloride, thiamine nitrate, riboflavin-​ 5 '-​phosphate and nicotinamide) stability in presence <b>of</b> <b>salts</b> <b>and</b> trace elements. Vitamins in D 2 O were first analyzed by 1 H NMR spectroscopy in absence <b>of</b> <b>salts</b> <b>and</b> trace elements; changes in chem. shifts or in diffusion coeffs., measured by NMR DOSY technique, were analyzed. The effects <b>of</b> <b>salts</b> <b>and</b> trace elements on single vitamins and on their admixts. were then investigated by performing quant. analyses during 48 h. Selected vitamins are subject to intermol. interactions. No degradative effects were obsd. in presence <b>of</b> <b>salts</b> <b>and</b> trace elements. Only riboflavin-​ 5 '-​phosphate is subject to pptn. in presence of divalent cations; however, at low concn. and in presence of other vitamins this effect was not obsd. Solns. analyzed, in the condition of this study, are stable for at least 48 h and vitamins and trace elements can be administered together in TPN...|$|R
40|$|Temperatures {{higher than}} 20 ºC can boost the growth, on the <b>salted</b> <b>and</b> dried cod surface, of {{bacteria}} that present a red pigment (Rodrigues et al., 2003; Rodrigues et al., 2005). These organisms, besides {{the change of}} the food product appearance, also cause an unpleasant flavor and the product is rejected by the consumers, although does not cause any health concern. Currently, the export <b>of</b> <b>salted</b> <b>and</b> dried cod, to Africa, has increased and {{a great amount of}} product is rejected due to the high environmental temperature and the lack of a proper cold chain storage infrastructure. Vacuum packaging, and modified atmosphere packaging have been used for fresh and cooked seafood preservation, but, as far as the authors know, were never used to preserve <b>salted</b> <b>and</b> dried fish. In the present study it was observed the effect of vacuum packaging, packaging with 80 %N 2 : 20 %CO 2 and finally the addition of sodium metabisulfite on the <b>salted</b> <b>and</b> dried cod stored under temperature abuse (15 ºC, 25 ºC and 35 ºC). Accordingly, packaging under vacum and, specially, packaging with 80 %N 2 : 20 %CO 2 successfuly increased the shellife <b>of</b> <b>salted</b> <b>and</b> dried cod. The addition of sodium metabisulfite has increased the shelflife <b>of</b> <b>salted</b> <b>and</b> dried cod preserved at 15 ºC, but not <b>of</b> <b>salted</b> <b>and</b> dried cod preserved at 25 ºC and 35 ºC...|$|R
5|$|In the {{smelting}} {{process of}} using huge bellows driven by waterwheels, {{massive amounts of}} charcoal {{were used in the}} production process, leading {{to a wide range of}} deforestation in northern China. However, by the end of the 11th century the Chinese discovered that using bituminous coke could replace the role of charcoal, hence many acres of forested land in northern China were spared from the steel and iron industry with this switch of resources. Iron and steel of this period were used to mass-produce ploughs, hammers, needles, pins, nails for ships, musical cymbals, chains for suspension bridges, Buddhist statues, and other routine items for an indigenous mass market. Iron was also a necessary manufacturing component for the production processes <b>of</b> <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> copper. Many newly constructed canals linked the major iron and steel production centers to the capital city's main market. This was also extended to trade with the outside world, which greatly expanded with the high level of Chinese maritime activity abroad during the Southern Song period.|$|E
5|$|Salt {{is mostly}} sodium chloride, the ionic {{compound}} with the formula NaCl, representing equal proportions of sodium and chlorine. Sea {{salt and freshly}} mined salt (much of which is sea salt from prehistoric seas) also contain small amounts of trace elements (which in these small amounts are generally good for plant and animal health). Mined salt is often refined {{in the production of}} table salt; it is dissolved in water, purified via precipitation of other minerals out of solution, and re-evaporated. During this same refining process it is often also iodized. Salt crystals are translucent and cubic in shape; they normally appear white but impurities may give them a blue or purple tinge. The molar mass of salt is 58.443 g/mol, its melting point is 801°C (1,474°F) and its boiling point 1,465°C (2,669°F). Its density is 2.17 grams per cubic centimetre and it is readily soluble in water. When dissolved in water it separates into Na+ and Cl− ions, and the solubility is 359 grams per litre. From cold solutions, salt crystallises as the dihydrate NaCl·2H2O. Solutions of sodium chloride have very different properties from those of pure water; the freezing point is −21.12°C (−6.02°F) for 23.31wt% <b>of</b> <b>salt,</b> <b>and</b> the boiling point of saturated salt solution is around 108.7°C (227.7°F).|$|E
