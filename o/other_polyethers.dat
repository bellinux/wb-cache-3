40|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} to ciguatoxin (CTX) and okadaic acid (OA) {{have been prepared}} using hybridoma technology. Spleen cells from BALB/C mice immunized with CTX-HSA and OA-HSA conjugates were fused with a mouse myeloma, P 3 X 63 -Ag 8. 653. Hybrids designated 5 C 8 (MonoAb-CTX) and 10 C 3 (MonoAb-OA) were selected for further studies. The reactivity of the antibodies produced by the two hybrids with CTX and OA were tested using an enzyme immunoassay.

40|$|The {{pyrolysis}} {{behavior of}} reducing monosaccharides was compared {{in the presence}} and absence of tetraethyleneglycol dimethylether (TEGDE), a polyether (N 2 / 150 – 250 °C). The pyrolytic pathways changed drastically in TEGDE. Glucose started to decompose at > 160 °C under the neat conditions, and polysaccharides, anhydrosugars (levoglucosan and 1, 6 -anhydroglucofuranose), a colored substance and char were the major products. However, glucose was completely stabilized against decomposition in TEGDE and instead converted into fragmentation products including formaldehyde, glycolaldehyde, glyceraldehyde, 1, 3 -dihydroxyacetone, erythrose and erythrulose at higher temperatures. The total yield of the fragmentation products reached a 74. 9 wt% at 250 °C. An aldose–ketose isomerization and retro-aldol fragmentation including a six-membered cyclic transition state were suggested as the principle mechanisms. Several <b>other</b> <b>polyethers</b> gave similar results. This unique property of polyether {{can be explained by}} the basicity of the ether oxygen which acts as a proton acceptor for the hydroxyl groups in the sugar. This H-bonding between the polyether and glucose may prevent inter- and intramolecular H-bonding (H-donation to the oxygen atoms) of glucose, which results in stabilization against transglycosylation and dehydration reactions. Such inter- and intramolecular H-bonding (H-donation) may also be involved in the thermal decomposition of the melt sugar as an activation (acid catalysis) mechanism...|$|E

40|$|Biosynthetic {{origins of}} the cyclic imine toxin 13 -desmethyl spirolide C were {{determined}} by supplementing cultures of the toxigenic dinoflagellate Alexandrium ostenfeldii with stable isotope-labeled precursors [1, 2 - 13 C 2]acetate, [1 - 13 C]acetate, [2 - 13 CD 3]acetate, and [1, 2 - 13 C 2, 15 N]glycine and measuring the incorporation patterns by 13 C NMR spectroscopy. Despite partial scrambling of the acetate labels, {{the results show that}} most carbons of the macrocycle are polyketide-derived and that glycine is incorporated as an intact unit into the cyclic imine moiety.

40|$|Tetrahydropyran {{rings are}} a common feature of complex polyketide natural products, but {{much remains to be}} learned about the {{enzymology}} of their formation. The enzyme SalBIII from the salinomycin biosynthetic pathway resembles <b>other</b> <b>polyether</b> epoxide hydrolases/cyclases of the MonB family, but SalBIII plays no role in the conventional cascade of ring opening/closing. Mutation in the salBIII gene gave a metabolite in which ring A is not formed. Using this metabolite in vitro as a substrate analogue, SalBIII has been shown to form pyran ring A. We have determined the X-ray crystal structure of SalBIII, and structure-guided mutagenesis of putative active-site residues has identified Asp 38 and Asp 104 as an essential catalytic dyad. The demonstrated pyran synthase activity of SalBIII further extends the impressive catalytic versatility of α+β barrel fold proteins...|$|R

Damsel fish fed 50 / 50 -SC/DC and 100 % DC diets exhibited physical and behavioral changes as well as death. Feed refusal was apparent among the fish fed 100 % DC diet. Toxicity of the control group {{could be attributed to}} previous exposure of the fish to <b>other</b> <b>polyether</b> compounds in its natural habitat or even other chemicals. Fish extracts of both control and treatment groups were toxic when tested on the Stick-enzyme immunoassay for ciguatoxin.

40|$|Tumor {{necrosis}} factor-related apoptosis-induced ligand (TRAIL) is preferentially cytotoxic {{to cancer}} cells over normal cells. However, many cancer cells, including malignant glioma cells, {{tend to be}} resistant to TRAIL. Monensin (a polyether ionophore antibiotic that is widely used in veterinary medicine) and salinomycin (a compound that is structurally related to monensin and shows cancer stem cell-inhibiting activity) are currently recognized as anticancer drug candidates. In this study, we show that monensin effectively sensitizes various glioma cells, but not normal astrocytes, to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis; this occurs at least partly via monensin-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, CHOP-mediated DR 5 upregulation and proteasome-mediated downregulation of c-FLIP. Interestingly, <b>other</b> <b>polyether</b> antibiotics, such as salinomycin, nigericin, narasin and lasalocid A, also stimulated TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in glioma cells via ER stress, CHOP-mediated DR 5 upregulation and c-FLIP downregulation.

40|$|The processing, {{mechanical}} and chemical properties of poly(ether ester) s, prepared from pivalolactone (PVL), 1, 4 -butanediol (4 G) and dimethyl terephthalate (DMT), were studied. The poly(ether ester) s {{could easily be}} processed by injection moulding, owing to their favourable rheological and thermal properties. The tensile response of a poly(ether ester) with a butylene terephthalate (4 GT) content of 72 mol%, which exhibited the phenomena of necking and strain-hardening, {{was related to the}} morphology of these copolymers. The influence of the short 4 G-PVL segments was reflected in a high Young's modulus and yield stress, and resulted in a tough behaviour for the poly(ether ester), with an ultimate elongation of 500 %. The poly(ether ester) s were stable towards treatment at room temperature with water or weakly acidic or alkaline solutions. Conditioning at 90 °C in water for 264 h resulted in a water uptake of 1 wt%, whereas the rate of hydrolysis was 0. 0003 (expressed in An rel h- 1) for the poly(ether ester) with a 4 GT content of 72 mol%. Although a decay in the mechanical properties for the PVL-based poly(ether ester) after exposure to water at 90 °C was observed, these materials were assumed to have a higher hydrolytical stability than <b>other</b> <b>poly(ether</b> ester) ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Two field {{isolates}} of Eimeria tenella {{were isolated}} on farms where continuous outbreaks of coccidiosis in broilers had occurred over several years. The isolates were repeatedly tested for their sensitivity to ionophorous polyether drugs in floor pen trials lasting 7 wk. Hybro cockerels were inoculated with 25 x 103 oocysts/chicken {{at the age}} of 23 to 24 days. Total mortality, mortality caused by coccidia, live weights, feed conversion ratios, number of oocysts in litter, and titers of circulating antibodies against E. tenella were followed. Tested isolates were not controlled by the monovalent polyether drugs monensin, narasin, and salinomycin, but maduramicin, which is a monovalent monoglycoside polyether, and the bivalent polyether lasalocid controlled them effectively. This study indicates that coccidia that lose their sensitivity to a monovalent polyether drug lose the sensitivity to <b>other</b> monovalent <b>polyethers,</b> also, but might yet be effectively controlled by drugs from <b>other</b> classes of <b>polyether</b> antibiotics. This supports the hypothesis that there are differences in the mechanisms of anticoccidial activity of different classes of polyether antibiotics.

40|$|A natural {{phenomenon}} characterized by dense aggregations of unicellular photosynthetic marine organisms has been termed colloquially as red tides {{because of the}} vivid discoloration of the water. The dinoflagellate Karenia brevis {{is the cause of}} the Florida red tide bloom. ^ K. brevis produces the brevetoxins, a potent suite of neurotoxins responsible for substantial amounts of marine mammal and fish mortalities. When consumed by humans, the toxin causes Neurotoxic Shellfish Poisoning (NSP). The native function of brevetoxin within the organism has remained mysterious since its discovery. There is a need to identify factors which contribute to and regulate toxin production within K. brevis. These toxins are produced and retained within the cell implicating a significant cellular role for their presence. ^ Localization of brevetoxin and identification of a native receptor may provide insight into its native role as well as <b>other</b> <b>polyether</b> ladder type toxins such as the ciguatoxins, maitotoxins, and yessotoxins. In higher organisms these polyether ladder molecules bind to transmembrane proteins with high affinity. We anticipated the native brevetoxin receptor would also be a transmembrane protein. ^ Photoaffinity labeling has become increasingly popular for identifying ligand receptors. By attaching ligands to these photophors, one is able to activate the molecule after the ligand binds to its receptor to obtain a permanent linkage between the two. Subsequent purification provides the protein with the ligand directly attached. ^ A molecule that is capable of fluorescence is a fluorophore, which upon excitation is capable of re-emitting light. Fluorescent labeling uses fluorophores by attaching them covalently to biologically active compounds. The synthesis of a brevetoxin photoaffinity probe and its application in identifying a native brevetoxin receptor will be described. The preparation of a fluorescent derivative of brevetoxin will be described and its use in localizing the toxin to an organelle within K. brevis. In addition, the general utility of a synthesized photoaffinity label with other toxins having similar functionality will be described. ^ An alternative synthetic approach to a general photoaffinity label will also be discussed whose goal was to accelerate the preparation and improve the overall synthetic yields of a multifunctional label. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare {{different}} types of impression trays for the closed-mouth impression technique, using two different types of impression material. For this study, five different types of impression trays were used with two different types of impression materials, one of addition silicone and the <b>other</b> of <b>polyether.</b> We designed a model used for taking the impressions and for measuring interocclusal distortion. The results obtained show that the impression trays COE (GC (R) GC America INC. Alsip) and Premier (Premier (R), Premier Dental Products Co.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of two impression materials on the shear bond strength of porcelain to immediately sealed dentin. Materials and Methods: Smooth dentin surfaces of 45 extracted premolars were immediately sealed with Adper Single Bond adhesive agent. Forty-five porcelain specimens were also prepared. The teeth were divided into one control and two experimental groups. Incontrol group, an adhesive layer to dentin was applied and feldspathic porcelain specimens were bonded to dentin with Relay X dual-curing cement. In one experimental group, the teeth were embedded in condensational silicon (Speedex) and in the <b>other</b> group in <b>polyether</b> (Impregum Soft) impression materials before bonding the porcelain specimens as in the control group. Shear bond strengths were measured using a universal testing machine. Fracture modes were evaluated under a stereomicroscope. Data was analyzed using onewayANOVA, Tukey, and chi-square tests (α= 0. 05). Results: No significant differences existed between bond strength of the control and condensational silicon groups (P= 0. 31). Bond strength was significantly lower in polyether group in comparison with the control (P< 0. 0005) and condensational silicon groups(P= 0. 002).

40|$|The {{mechanism}} {{governing the}} redox-stimulated switching {{behavior of a}} tristable [2]rotaxane consisting of a cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) (CBPQT^ 4 +) ring encircling a dumbbell, containing tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) and 1, 5 -dioxynaphthalene (DNP) recognition units which are separated from each <b>other</b> along a <b>polyether</b> chain carrying 2, 6 -diisopropylphenyl stoppers by a 4, 4 ′-bipyridinium (BIPY^ 2 +) unit, is described. The BIPY^ 2 + unit acts to increase the lifetime of the metastable state coconformation (MSCC) significantly by restricting the shuttling motion of the CBPQTT^ 4 + ring {{to such an extent}} that the MSCC can be isolated in the solid state and is stable for weeks on end. As controls, the redox-induced mechanism of switching of two bistable [2]rotaxanes and one bistable [2]catenane composed of CBPQT^ 4 + rings encircling dumbbells or macrocyclic polyethers, respectively, that contain a BIPY 2 + unit with either a TTF or DNP unit, is investigated. Variable scan-rate cyclic voltammetry and digital simulations of the tristable and bistable [2]rotaxanes and [2]catenane reveal a mechanism which involves a bisradical state coconformation (BRCC) in which only one of the BIPY^•+ units in the CBPQT^ 2 (•+) ring is oxidized to the BIPY 2 + dication. This observation of the BRCC was further confirmed by theoretical calculations as well as by X-ray crystallography of the [2]catenane in its bisradical tetracationic redox state. It is evident that the incorporation of a kinetic barrier between the donor recognition units in the tristable [2]rotaxane can prolong the lifetime and stability of the MSCC, an observation which augurs well for the development of nonvolatile molecular flash memory devices...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasingly}} apparent {{environmental problems}} in our surroundings necessitate a quest for sustainable development {{in all areas of}} human endeavour. Within the field of chemistry and the production of chemicals, the focus is increasingly on the development of green chemistry. This discipline aims to reduce environmental impact by replacing petrochemical raw materials with renewable feedstock and also to increase the efficiency of chemical processes. The latter can be done by reducing energy use and by improving atom economy, i. e. to ensure that as much as possible of the used raw materials end up in the final product. Acrylates are highly reactive compounds, with applications in many areas. This work has focused on developing a process for the production of acrylates that can be used as UV-curing wood coatings, where these products {{have been shown to be}} highly efficient from an environmental point of view. The traditional process for making acrylates is relatively complex and requires lower reaction temperatures than are ideal for chemical catalysis. Enzymes, on the other hand, are ideally suited for such conditions. The use of lipases for acrylation reactions has previously been the subject of relatively little scientific research and a large part of this thesis has therefore been devoted to the catalytic function of the enzyme used in these reactions, Candida antarctica lipase B (CalB). It was found that because the chemical structure of acrylic compounds is different from that of ordinary fatty acids, they were relatively poor substrates for CalB. The results presented in this work indicate that the binding of acrylic substrates in the active site of the enzyme is inhibited both by linear alcohols (octanol) and by water present in the system. Furthermore, acrylic acid is shown to be a potent inhibitor of CalB, which makes this enzyme more suitable for transesterification reactions. Very high catalytic rates were achieved at dry, solvent-free conditions with ethyl acrylate in excess. CalB is commercially available as an immobilised enzyme preparation, Novozym® 435 (N 435), which has been used successfully for making chiral intermediates in the production of pharmaceuticals. One problem with N 435 is that it is a relatively expensive catalyst, which limits its use in more mundane applications such as the production of bulk chemicals. It was found that CalB was considerably more active and also more stable when immobilised onto porous polypropylene (Accurel® MP 1000), making this type of preparation considerably more cost effective. Immobilisation on MP 1000 also distributes the enzyme over a larger volume for a given protein loading, which allows these preparations to catalyse reactions at higher rates without being limited by substrate diffusion. The second part of the thesis is devoted to the development of a process for the preparative synthesis of polymer-based acrylates and to the formulation of a product that is able to compete with existing acrylates for wood coatings that are available today. The resulting process incorporates continuous distillation for by-product removal coupled with continuous addition of ethyl acrylate to limit product degradation and to increase the product yield. It is shown that the enzymatic activity in this process is high compared to previously published studies. The enzymatic stability in the process was also quite high, with half-lives between 180 and 320 h for the tested enzyme preparations. The combined high activity and high stability led to the conclusion that catalyst cost should not be a limiting factor in the implementation of this process, especially for the preparation based on MP 1000. The products synthesised with the enzymatic acrylation process were evaluated as wood coatings and compared to commercial alternatives. All of the products (including the commercial acrylates) displayed some weaknesses, but it turned out that a mixture of two enzymatically acrylated products, one based on a polyester and the <b>other</b> on a <b>polyether,</b> performed well in the tests. This mixture cured at an adequate rate and produced a film with good hardness and excellent chemical resistance against coffee, alcohol, water and grease. The work presented in this thesis illustrates that enzymes can be useful tools for the production of bulk chemicals. The developed process is advantageous in that it allows the use of low reaction temperatures in the synthesis of products that are competitive with commercially available alternatives. Due to the high activity and stability of the enzyme preparation used, the presented method is deemed an economically feasible alternative to the traditional chemical process...|$|R
