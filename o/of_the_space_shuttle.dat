5|$|STS-8 was {{the eighth}} NASA Space Shuttle mission {{and the third}} flight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> Challenger. It {{launched}} on August 30, 1983 and landed on September 5, conducting the first night launch and night landing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> program. It also carried the first African-American astronaut, Guion Bluford. The mission successfully achieved all of its planned research objectives, but was marred by the subsequent discovery that a solid-fuel rocket booster had almost malfunctioned catastrophically during the launch.|$|E

5|$|The crew's {{preparation}} for the mission had begun some thirteen months earlier in 1994, with the crew being trained in the operation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>shuttle,</b> the mating and docking procedures {{that would be required}} as Atlantis approached Mir later in the mission, and the management of the various scientific experiments being carried on the orbiter during the mission.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Lunney became manager <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>shuttle</b> program, a {{high-level}} position where Lunney found himself responsible for setting {{the agenda for}} the developing program. His responsibilities were broad ones; they included supervising program planning, budgeting and scheduling; systems engineering; and mission planning. During the earlier shuttle flights he was even involved in determining whether the weather was suitable for launch, but in later years that responsibility was largely devolved to lower levels of the hierarchy.|$|E

5|$|STS-74 was {{the fourth}} mission of the US/Russian Shuttle-Mir Program, and the second docking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> with Mir. Space Shuttle Atlantis lifted off from Kennedy Space Center launch pad 39A on 12 November 1995. The mission ended 8 days later with the landing of Atlantis back at Kennedy.

5|$|The Shuttle fleet {{lost two}} orbiters and 14 astronauts in two disasters: Challenger in 1986, and Columbia in 2003. While the 1986 loss was mitigated by {{building}} the Space Shuttle Endeavour from replacement parts, NASA did not build another orbiter {{to replace the}} second loss. NASA's Space Shuttle program had 135 missions when the program ended with the successful landing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> Atlantis at the Kennedy Space Center on July 21, 2011. The program spanned 30 years with over 300 astronauts sent into space.|$|E

5|$|Three spacewalks were {{conducted}} by the crew of STS-97, {{all of which were}} completed prior to opening the hatch between shuttle and station. On 8 December, the hatch between the two was opened and the two crews greeted each other for the first time. It had remained closed to maintain their respective atmospheric pressures. The Expedition 1 crew took this opportunity to leave the station and tour the inside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>shuttle,</b> which was thought to be good for their psychological well-being.|$|E
5|$|Each Space Shuttle {{had three}} RS-25 engines, {{installed}} in the aft structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> orbiter in the Orbiter Processing Facility prior to the orbiter being transferred to the Vehicle Assembly Building. If necessary the engines could be changed on the pad. The engines, drawing propellant from the Space Shuttle external tank (ET) via the orbiter's main propulsion system (MPS), were ignited at T−6.6 seconds prior to liftoff (with each ignition staggered by 120ms), which allowed their performance to be checked prior to ignition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs), which committed the shuttle to the launch. At launch, the engines would be operating at 100% RPL, throttling up to 104.5% immediately following liftoff. The engines would maintain this power level until around T+40 seconds, {{where they would be}} throttled back to around 70% to reduce aerodynamic loads on the shuttle stack as it passed through the region of maximum dynamic pressure, or max Q. The engines would then be throttled back up until around T+8 minutes, at which point they would be gradually throttled back down to 67% to prevent the stack exceeding 3g of acceleration as it became progressively lighter due to propellant consumption. The engines were then shut down, a procedure known as main engine cutoff (MECO), at around T+8.5 minutes.|$|E
