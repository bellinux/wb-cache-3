50|$|The acid in {{a baking}} powder can be either {{fast-acting}} or slow-acting. A fast-acting acid reacts in a wet mixture with baking soda at room temperature, and a slow-acting acid will not react until heated in an <b>oven.</b> <b>Baking</b> powders that contain both fast- and slow-acting acids are double-acting; those that contain only one acid are single-acting. By providing a second rise in the oven, double-acting baking powders increase the reliability of baked goods by rendering the time elapsed between mixing and baking less critical, {{and this is the}} type most widely available to consumers today. Double-acting baking powders work in two phases; once when cold, and once when hot. Common low-temperature acid salts include cream of tartar and monocalcium phosphate (also called calcium acid phosphate). High-temperature acid salts include sodium aluminium sulfate, sodium aluminum phosphate, and sodium acid pyrophosphate. Despite very low acute toxicity, exposure to aluminum salts has raised concerns regarding potential neurotoxicity.|$|E
50|$|Food {{processing}} {{dates back}} to the prehistoric ages when crude processing incorporated fermenting, sun drying, preserving with salt, and various types of cooking (such as roasting, smoking, steaming, and <b>oven</b> <b>baking),</b> Such basic food processing involved chemical enzymatic changes to the basic structure of food in its natural form, as well served to build a barrier against surface microbial activity that caused rapid decay. Salt-preservation was especially common for foods that constituted warrior and sailors' diets until the introduction of canning methods. Evidence for the existence of these methods {{can be found in the}} writings of the ancient Greek, Chaldean, Egyptian and Roman civilizations as well as archaeological evidence from Europe, North and South America and Asia. These tried and tested processing techniques remained essentially the same until the advent of the industrial revolution. Examples of ready-meals also date back to before the preindustrial revolution, and include dishes such as Cornish pasty and Haggis. Both during ancient times and today in modern society these are considered processed foods.|$|E

40|$|Hybrid IR/convective <b>oven</b> <b>baking</b> of {{high quality}} {{industrial}} powder coatings {{is one of the}} most attractive method to achieve significant economic and process time savings. This method is based on two curing steps: at first, a pigmented decorative basecoat is electrostatically sprayed and, then, pre-cured with IR-radiation, secondly, a transparent protective topcoat is sprayed on the basecoat and the resulting bilayer coating is oven baked. The optimization of the IR pre-curing conditions and the correlation between the effect of polymerization degree of the basecoat and the wear resistance of the whole coating system are investigated. In particular, an experimental study in which the degree of chemical conversion of the pigmented basecoat, the overall coating morphology and its thermal, mechanical and tribological properties are analyzed in the light of IR-radiation time and power, has been carried out. Experimental results show that the intermediate range of curing time and IR power investigated leads to properly cured basecoats and subsequently to better morphological, mechanical and tribological behavior of the whole coating system. These results were also validated by comparison with the coatings cross-linked by the traditional two-step <b>oven</b> <b>baking</b> process. © 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Metal-flake powder {{coatings}} are a special class of metallic paint finishes {{composed of two}} superimposed layers: a pigmented decorative base coat and an overlaying transparent protective top coat. In the present investigation, a novel curing procedure for such bilayer coatings is proposed. Flash IR pre-curing of the base coat promotes {{the formation of a}} surface diffusion barrier and limits movement of the decorative pigments and metal flakes around their initial positions. <b>Oven</b> <b>baking</b> after deposition of the top coat then completes curing of the bilayer coating. The influence of the IR intensity and irradiation time on the final properties of bilayer coatings was investigated. The visual appearance, surface morphology and scratch resistance were evaluated.

40|$|The {{addition}} of bunashimeji affected gas production in baker's yeast. After 4 hours of incubation, total gas production increased about 1. 8 {{times that of}} standard dough, and a few large holes and many small holes appeared {{on top of the}} dough containing bunashimeji after 6 hours of incubation. Gas production increased with increasing consumption of glucose in bunashimeji. The {{addition of}} bunashimeji to wheat flour increased production of low molecular weight sugar (fermentable sugar). Therefore, we concluded that adding bunashimeji to white bread dough provided nutrients as fermentable sugar for the yeast. This resulted in excessive initial production of gas forming holes upon exiting the dough, and reducing the volume of the dough as a result. Consequently, dough in which holes were formed on top was broken before <b>oven</b> <b>baking,</b> and loaf volume and specific loaf volume of the bread containing 5 % bunashimeji was markedly decreased when an automatic bread baker was used...|$|E

The primary HCAs in these samples were PhIP (2 -amino- 1 -methyl- 6 -phenylimidazo [4, 5 -b]pyridine) (1. 49 – 10. 89 ng/g), MeIQx (2 -amino- 3, 8 -dimethylimidazo [4, 5 -f]quinoxaline) (not detected- 4. 0 ng/g), and DiMeIQx (2 -amino- 3, 4, 8 -trimethyl-imidazo [4, 5 -f]quinoxaline) (not detected- 3. 57 ng/g).

A study was therefore undertaken to evaluate the influence of rendering methods on the amounts and general properties of the fat recovered from broiler skin. Methods The yield and quality of the broiler skin fat rendered through high and lower energy microwave rendering (3. 6 W/g for 10 min and 2. 4 W/g for 10 min for high power microwave rendering (HPMR) and high power microwave rendering (LPMR), respectively), <b>oven</b> <b>baking</b> (OB, at 180 °C for 40 min), and water cooking (WC, boiling for 40 min) were compared.

40|$|Electrostatic spray {{deposition}} (ESD) of aesthetic and protective low curable transparent powder coatings onto carbon fibre-reinforced epoxy composites (i. e., carbon laminates) {{is the matter}} of the present investigation. An original environment friendly pretreatment of the substrate, based on fluidized bed peening of glass beads followed by a moderate temperature <b>oven</b> <b>baking,</b> has been proposed. Then, the influence of ESD operational parameters on coating performance has been looked into. Design of experiments (DOE) was used to schedule the experimental trials. Coating thickness and its uniformity over the coated substrates upon curing was systematically evaluated. Further, visual appearance of the coatings was analyzed by both optical and stereoscopic microscopy. Finally, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to model the available experimental data. Detailed examinations of the experimental results allowed to define the best settings of ESD process as well as the maximum deposition time before the occurrence of severe electrical breakdown in the powder layer and/or the increase in the incidence of massive back-ionization phenomena. Accordingly, 3 D process maps of the coating thickness versus the operational parameters, applied voltage, feeding and auxiliary pressure, were developed, thus supporting the practitioners in their choices and in the identification of processing windows wide enough for practical purposes. © 2008 Elsevier B.
