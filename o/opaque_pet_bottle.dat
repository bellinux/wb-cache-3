40|$|The {{effects of}} {{packaging}} materials on preserving the functional component of pine bud beverage stored under UV (ultraviolet) light exposure conditions were studied. The order of UV light blocking {{properties of the}} selected packages was: <b>opaque</b> can> <b>opaque</b> <b>PET</b> (polyethylene terepthalate) with green lamination=transparent PET with 10 % PEN (polyethylene naphthalate) blending> transparent PET, and did not depend on film thickness in specified range. At 20 oC, the order of preserving degree of original color and endobornyl acetate, which is quality index of pine bud beverage, {{was the same as}} above. Exposure to UV light can cause of deterioration of functional food components, but green color lamination and blending of PEN materials with transparent PET help to preserve the UV sensitive pine bud beverage components. However, the treated <b>PET</b> <b>bottles</b> have poorer preservation capa-bilities than the <b>opaque</b> cans. Transparent <b>PET</b> with PEN blending, in particular, will be very useful packaging material for colorful functional beverage preservation by helping to protect the ingredients while attracting consum-er attention...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Polyethylene {{terephthalate}} containers (<b>PET</b> <b>bottles)</b> are recycled into {{fibers and}} sheets, but the complicated process requires {{a high level}} of technology and large cost resulting in a low recycling rate of PET. Weight reduction of concrete has been demanded for certain uses. In view of this, lightweight concrete embedding raw <b>PET</b> <b>bottles</b> is conceivable. It may be used for void slabs and lightweight wall panels for dwelling units. Also such bottles filled with functional materials can add a new function to concrete. In this study, the basic physical properties of lightweight multifunctional concrete embedding used <b>PET</b> <b>bottles</b> were investigated. A method of placing concrete with embedded <b>PET</b> <b>bottles</b> was examined. <b>PET</b> <b>bottles</b> fixed to the mold at their caps withstood the impact and the pressure during concrete placing with no deformation, and the filling capability of concrete was confirmed. The weight reduction of the reinforcing concrete panel embedding <b>PET</b> <b>bottles</b> was approximately 16 %.

Results of the 13 -months experimental study indicate that the enclosure of the oxygen scavenger in the plastic matrix is able to better maintain the quality and authenticity attributes of the EVOO: a reduced flux of oxygen through the <b>PET</b> <b>bottle</b> keeps the level of primary and secondary oxidation products lower than that obtained in simple <b>PET</b> <b>bottles</b> stored under the same conditions.

The objective is to reduce oxidation of packaged beverages and oils. However, few studies were performed about the long-time influence of temperature on <b>PET</b> <b>bottles</b> with oxygen scavenger additives. Such knowledge is relevant for the development of accelerated tests. In this study, the influence of temperature on oxygen permeation of <b>PET</b> <b>bottles</b> with the oxygen scavenger additives MXD 6 or Oxyclear® was examined. <b>PET</b> <b>bottles</b> made of blends of PET with 2, 5 and 8 wt. −% MXD 6, respectively, or with 2 wt. −% Oxyclear® were filled with deoxygenated water. The bottles were stored at 5, 23, 38 and 55 °C up to 5 years. Oxygen partial pressure of the water in the bottles was measured regularly. As expected, oxygen partial pressure increased earlier at higher temperature because of faster exhaustion of the oxygen scavenger. Oxygen partial pressure of water in <b>PET</b> <b>bottles</b> with 8 wt. −% MXD 6 was below 10 mbar even after 5 years storage time at 5 and 23 °C. Oxygen absorption capacity of activated MXD 6 was at least 76 mg/g.
