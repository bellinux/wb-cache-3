5|$|Entering {{his senior}} year, many scouts had Croyle ranked {{as high as}} the #2 quarterback in the country behind Joe Mauer, who would go on to play Major League Baseball. However, Croyle's high school career ended {{abruptly}} in the first game <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>senior</b> season against Glencoe High School after a hit by an opposing player tore Croyle's anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), causing him to miss the remainder <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>senior</b> year. When he graduated, he held the Alabama state records for career passing yards with 9,323, and career touchdowns with 105. He set marks for most passing yards in a single season, passing yards in a single game, touchdown passes in a season, and touchdown passes in a game.|$|E

They quickly conquered Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Belgium and France surrendered on 22 June. The unexpectedly swift defeat of France resulted in an upswing in Hitler's popularity and a strong upsurge in war fever.|$|E

5|$|After the Battle of Culloden in 1746, it was rumoured that Prince Charles Edward Stuart {{and some}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>senior</b> Jacobite aides had escaped to St Kilda. An {{expedition}} was launched, and {{in due course}} British soldiers were ferried ashore to Hirta. They found a deserted village, as the St Kildans, fearing pirates, had fled to caves to the west. When they were persuaded to come down, the soldiers discovered that the isolated natives knew nothing of the Prince and {{had never heard of}} King George II either. Paradoxically, Lady Grange's letters and her resultant evacuation from the island may have prevented her being found by this expedition.|$|E

5|$|At Cranbrook, Romney helped {{manage the}} ice hockey team, {{and he joined}} the pep squad. During his senior year, he joined the cross country running team. He belonged to eleven school {{organizations}} and school clubs overall, including the Blue Key Club, a booster group that he had started. During his final year there, his academic record improved but fell short of excellence. Romney was involved in several pranks while attending Cranbrook. He has since apologized for those, stating {{that some of the}} pranks may have gone too far. In March <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>senior</b> year, he began dating Ann Davies; she attended the private Kingswood School, the sister school to Cranbrook. The two became informally engaged around the time of his June 1965 graduation.|$|E

5|$|Adenhart had a 6–0 {{record with}} a 1.04 earned run average {{during the regular season}} in his junior year, and as a result was named the Gatorade Player of the Year in Maryland. In a 1–0 loss during the playoff quarterfinal matchup, he threw a no-hitter and had 14 strikeouts. Entering his final high school season, Baseball America dubbed Adenhart the top high school {{prospect}} in the country. In his senior year, Adenhart threw a perfect game in his very first outing, striking out 15 of the 21 batters faced. Entering the final regular season game of his high school career, he had a 5–1 record, a 0.73 ERA and an average of 2.2 strikeouts per inning. During November <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>senior</b> year, Adenhart signed a letter of intent to play with the North Carolina Tar Heels baseball team at the University of North Carolina, although his chances of being drafted high continued to climb and the North Carolina coaching staff saw their chances of acquiring Adenhart to be slim.|$|E
5|$|After three days, {{unable to}} persuade {{his men to}} back down, Alexander gave Persians command posts {{in the army and}} conferred Macedonian {{military}} titles upon Persian units. The Macedonians quickly begged forgiveness, which Alexander accepted, and held a great banquet for several thousand of his men at which he and they ate together. In an attempt to craft a lasting harmony between his Macedonian and Persian subjects, Alexander held a mass marriage <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>senior</b> officers to Persian and other noblewomen at Susa, but few of those marriages seem to have lasted much beyond a year. Meanwhile, upon his return to Persia, Alexander learned that guards of the tomb of Cyrus the Great in Pasargadae had desecrated it, and swiftly executed them. Alexander admired Cyrus the Great, from an early age reading Xenophon's Cyropaedia, which described Cyrus's heroism in battle and governance as a king and legislator. During his visit to Pasargadae Alexander ordered his architect Aristobulus to decorate the interior of the sepulchral chamber of Cyrus' tomb.|$|E

5|$|As a freshman, Amadi was {{designated}} a redshirt {{and did not}} play. As a backup cornerback in 2002, Amadi received substantial playing time due to personnel changes resulting in him being the sole backup to both starting cornerbacks. He continued in a reserve role through 2004. After backing up cornerback Theo Baines as a junior, Amadi started much <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>senior</b> season in place of Baines due to nagging injuries. In a November game against the Nebraska Cornhuskers, Amadi blocked a punt which was returned for a touchdown by teammate Darren Rus, marking the second time the two had combined to return a blocked punt for a touchdown. By early November, Amadi had recorded 22 tackles and two fumble recoveries in his final and most successful college season. Amadi also played on the college indoor track and field team while at Kansas when not involved in football activities.|$|E
5|$|Clark {{eventually}} {{applied for}} a Rhodes Scholarship and learned in December <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>senior</b> year at West Point {{that he had been}} accepted. He spent his summer at the United States Army Airborne School at Fort Benning, Georgia. He worked in the Philosophy, Politics, and Economics (PPE) program during his Rhodes Scholarship, completing his degree at Magdalen College at the University of Oxford in August 1968. While he was at Oxford, a Jewish cousin of Clark's who lived in England telephoned him and informed him of his Jewish heritage, having received permission from Veneta Clark. Clark spent three months after graduation at Fort Knox, Kentucky, going through Armor Officer Basic Course, then went on to Ranger School at Fort Benning. He was promoted to captain and was assigned as commander of the A Company of the 4th Battalion, 68th Armor, 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{reservations}} of some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>senior</b> ministers and governors, two months later, in January 811, al-Amin formally began {{the civil war}} when he appointed Ali ibn Isa governor of Khurasan, placed him {{at the head of}} an unusually large army of 40,000 men, drawn from the abnaʾ, and sent him to depose al-Ma'mun. When Ali ibn Isa set out for Khurasan, he reportedly took along a set of silver chains with which to bind al-Ma'mun and carry him back to Baghdad. The news of Ali's approach threw Khurasan into panic, and even al-Ma'mun considered fleeing. The only military force available to him was a small army of some 4,000–5,000 men, under Tahir ibn al-Husayn. Tahir was sent to confront Ali's advance, but it was widely regarded as almost a suicide mission, even by Tahir's own father. The two armies met at Rayy, on the western borders of Khurasan, and the ensuing battle (3 July 811) resulted in a crushing victory for the Khurasanis, in which Ali was killed and his army disintegrated on its flight west.|$|E

He served as the vice-president <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>senior</b> class {{and was a member}} of the Kappa Alpha Order. Like his older brother, Manning Holland Williams, he earned his degree after three years and was admitted to Phi Beta Kappa. At the age of 19, Williams enrolled at Harvard Business School, receiving his Master of Business Administration degree two years later. Following his graduation from Harvard Business School, Williams worked in the loan department at Manufacturers Trust Company in New York City for two years. Williams traveled to Europe, in 1937 and 1939, visiting Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia. Prior to this experience, Williams was an avowed pacifist, but after visiting Nazi Germany he felt obligated to enlist in the United States Navy.|$|E
5|$|He {{played in}} high school at Curie High School in Chicago where he won Naismith and Mr. Basketball USA {{recognition}} as national player of the year. He did not play organized basketball until eighth grade, but by late in his freshman season he became a notable contributor to his high school's varsity team. He was ranked among the top 20 prospects in the national class of 2014 prior to his sophomore season. As a junior, he moved into the top 10 of the national class and was recognized as an All-American. By the beginning <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>senior</b> season, he {{was considered to be}} a top 5 player by most talent evaluators and his stock was still on the rise. Following a Martin Luther King Day performance during his senior year against the number one team in the country, many experts considered him to be {{the best player in the}} national class of 2014.|$|E
5|$|His {{basketball}} {{performance in}} high school was unimpressive. He came off the bench to average four points per game (ppg). His stepmother informed him that when he graduated high school he would be {{thrown out of the}} house. Chris had been able to leave home on a football scholarship and would later play in the National Football League, but Washington himself had nowhere to go. He trained for three hours a day toward the end <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>senior</b> season, and showed up uninvited at a playground game featuring top high school players from Washington and Pennsylvania, where he talked his way into the game. Tom Young, who had recently left his job as an assistant coach at Maryland University to become head coach at American University, saw him play there, and although Washington did not perform particularly well, Young was impressed by his hustle and how he ignored the poor treatment he received from the people who organized the game.|$|E
