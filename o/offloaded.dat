30|$|Data {{computation}} <b>offloading</b> enables intelligent mobile {{devices to}} run greedy resource applications. However, {{in order to}} fully exploit computation <b>offloading</b> benefits, {{we have to deal}} with two key challenges. The first one is about <b>offloading</b> decision, and the second one is about <b>offloading</b> request scheduling among available cloud resources [18]. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a whole <b>offloading</b> strategy for H-CRAN composed of <b>offloading</b> decision and task scheduling in order to improve network performances and user QoE. Therefore, we jointly handle <b>offloading</b> decision and <b>offloading</b> request scheduling in Cloud-RRH. First, we proposed a dynamic multi-parameter <b>offloading</b> decision scheme in order to adapt <b>offloading</b> decision to the current network state and application characteristics. Then, scheduling mechanism was developed as linear programming optimization function that aims to reduce the total execution cost expressed as overload, network delay, and migration. Simulation results show that the proposed approach is able to improve QoS by reducing application response time and mobile device energy consumption while decreasing total execution cost in the Cloud-RRH.|$|R
40|$|Handheld smart {{devices are}} a trend nowadays. Such devices are shipped loaded with {{high-end}} processing cores yet a limited battery life. With the emerging of fast data connections, users {{tend to use}} these devices as a replacement of desktops and laptops.

Computation <b>offloading</b> is the go-to solution for overcoming smart phones resources limitations. ^ A lot of research has been done on computation <b>offloading</b> in terms of program representation and <b>offloading</b> granularity. Most <b>offloading</b> granularities used in previous work are code-driven such as class-based and function-based <b>offloading.</b> Allocation-site-based <b>offloading</b> has been proposed as an approach for data-centric, rather than code-centric <b>offloading.</b> However, although it is a step in the right direction, purely allocation-sites-based <b>offloading</b> suffers from a crucial flaw: due to the prevalence of data structure libraries, different data structures often use the same allocation sites, forcing logically distinct data structures to share <b>offloading</b> decisions and hence to be co-located. ^ We present a novel two-steps program analysis that captures ownership relations between objects to identify which parts of the source code can be carefully cloned to achieve a better data-centric <b>offloading.</b> The second contribution is a code generation and rewriting strategy that transforms the program to deploy data-structures-based <b>offloading</b> on the fairly mature class-based <b>offloading</b> tools. ^ Running a partitioned version of the Java Grande Benchmarks Suite showed a reduction of the number of messages between servers compared to the pure allocation-sites-based <b>offloading</b> and class-based <b>offloading.</b> ...|$|R

The twentieth voyage saw Sydney sail from Townsville on 13 May, with 4 RAR embarked. She met Duchess and Parramatta en route, and reached Vũng Tàu on 22 May. The ships left a day later, with 2 RAR aboard for the voyage home. Sydney arrived in Townsville on 1 June. In July 1971, Sydney sailed to Esquimalt, British Columbia for Canada's centennial naval assembly. She then visited San Diego to collect ten new A-4G Skyhawk aircraft for the Fleet Air Arm, and delivered these to Australia in mid-August. On 20 September, Sydney departed on the twenty-first voyage to Vietnam. The troopship first sailed to Singapore, where she <b>offloaded</b> equipment for the ANZUK force and met the destroyer escort Swan. The two ships were in Vũng Tàu for 6–7 October, during which 3 RAR was heli-lifted to Sydney for return to Australia, with the troopship arriving in Adelaide on 16 October. Ten days later, Sydney sailed from her namesake city for her twenty-second visit to Vietnam, with a cargo of Defence Aid stores. Meeting the destroyer escort Derwent en route, Sydney arrived in Vũng Tàu on 6 November, where the stores were <b>offloaded</b> and replaced by Australian personnel and equipment from assorted units over a two-day period. Arriving back in Sydney, the troopship left again on 24 November for her twenty-third voyage to Vietnam. Sydney met Swan off Subic Bay, then arrived in Vũng Tàu on 8 December, where 4 RAR, the 104th Battalion of the Royal Australian Artillery, and No. 9 Squadron were embarked for the return to Australia. The ship was visited by South Vietnamese President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu before departing, who thanked the efforts of the Australian military during the Vietnam War. Sydney arrived in Townsville on 17 December.|$|E

40|$|Mobile <b>offloading</b> is a {{promising}} technique {{to aid the}} constrained resources of a mobile device. By <b>offloading</b> a computational task, a device can save energy and increase {{the performance of the}} mobile applications. Unfortunately, in existing <b>offloading</b> systems, the opportunistic moments to <b>offload</b> a task are often sporadic and short-lived. We overcome this problem by proposing a social-aware hybrid <b>offloading</b> system (HyMobi), which increases the spectrum of <b>offloading</b> opportunities. As a mobile device is always co- located to at least one source of network infrastructure throughout of the day, by merging cloudlet, device-to-device and remote cloud <b>offloading,</b> we increase the availability of <b>offloading</b> support. Integrating these systems is not trivial. In order to keep such coupling, a strong social catalyst is required to foster user's participation and collaboration. Thus, we equip our system with an incentive mechanism based on credit and reputation, which exploits users' social aspects to create <b>offload</b> communities. We evaluate our system under controlled and in-the-wild scenarios. With credit, it is possible for a device to create opportunistic moments based on user's present need.

5|$|At {{approximately}} 10:00, {{the runway}} at Khâm Đức was cleared of the wrecked helicopter. Moments later, a C-130 piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Daryl D. Cole touched {{down on the}} runway under heavy fire, which flattened one tire and caused extensive damage to the wing tanks. Almost immediately, Cole's aircraft was rushed by hysterical Vietnamese civilians from ditches along the runway, filling the aircraft so the loadmaster was prevented from unloading the aircraft's cargo. Under heavy fire, Cole decided to navigate his aircraft down the cratered and shrapnel-littered runway, {{in order to take}} off. However, the combined weight of the cargo and civilians, in addition to the damage sustained during landing, prevented the aircraft from gathering enough speed to take off. So the aircrew aborted the take off, <b>offloaded</b> the civilians, and proceeded to cut off the blown tire to stop it from flapping and slowing down the aircraft. They were able to cut off the rubber with the bayonet, and were able to cut through the steel beading thanks to the engineers carefully cutting the steel cords with a blowtorch. A fire extinguisher was kept handy because of fear of catching the magnesium wheel on fire. About two hours later, realizing that enemy artillery rounds were coming closer to his aircraft, Colonel Cole tried to take off for the second time, and managed to get the C-130 into the air. This time his only passengers were three members of Air Force Combat Control Team (CCT), whose radio equipment had been destroyed.|$|E

The ship's officers also expressed concerns over mixing the cargoes of cotton and the oil and explosives, but were unable to find paperwork that advised against this practice. In 1942, the United States Government had published a book which advised against the carriage of raw cotton. A common myth at the time was that wet cotton bales could spontaneously combust. This was not the case, although cotton soaked in oil would readily do so. Before the ship sailed, the crew discovered that the barrels of lubricating oil leaked. Tarpaulins were nailed over the lower hold covers and the firefighting equipment on board was thoroughly tested. Extra fire drills were scheduled during the voyage to Karachi.
