5000|$|The Crosby Boys' own {{inability}} to cope blighted their lives. Their father had given {{an interview in}} 1959 when he said, [...] "I guess I didn’t do very well bringing my boys up. I think I failed them by giving them too much work and discipline, too much money, and too little time and attention. But I did my best and so did their mother." [...] Lindsay responded by saying [...] "I don’t know how <b>our</b> <b>dad</b> could feel he’s failed us as a father. Reading that he had said that in an interview really shook me up. I only hope someday that I can give my son a tenth of what Dad has given us. And that I can rate {{any part of the}} admiration we’ve always felt for him. That’s why it hurt so much to see him knocking himself in print. Taking himself apart and saying he punished us too much, that he was too strict with us, that he made us work too hard, that he spent too little time with us. That really shook me up." [...] Heavy drinking and their emotional problems took their toll. Lindsay died from a self-inflicted rifle shot to the head. He was 51. A family spokeswoman said Crosby shot himself to death in a Las Virgenes apartment after learning that the inheritance he relied on to support his family was gone. His distraught brother, Dennis, never recovered from Lindsay's death and also committed suicide with a shotgun in May 1991.|$|E

The Jonas Brothers introduced a tribute to Michael Jackson performed by Michael's fans in front of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, Germany. Nick Jonas was the one who opened the band's tribute speech. He said, [...] "This year we saw the loss of the greatest pop musician the world has ever seen.

[...] Nick Jonas then said to Green and fellow co-host Mike Ingham, [...] "Because he died in June boys." [...] Green then said, [...] "But we had tickets for his concerts at the O2 Arena in London, England when he died. We were really looking forward to seeing him live because we have never, ever, seen Michael Jackson play live." [...] Surprised, Nick Jonas then threw to his brother Joe Jonas as Green and Ingham left the stage with Green muttering [...] "Spoilsport" [...] at Nick. In his tribute, Joe said, [...] "The first time we heard Michael's voice was when <b>our</b> <b>dad</b> played the Jackson 5's [...] "I'll Be There". We were amazed by the one-of-a-kind talent. The way that he and his brothers came together to entertain the world has been an obvious influence on us." [...] Finally, it was Kevin Jonas's turn. Kevin said, [...] "Michael Jackson influenced every listener and every future performer with a talent the world had never seen before. As a writer, as a singer, as a dancer and as a performer he was the best." ...|$|E
