50|$|This sensor used {{a single}} Clark <b>oxygen</b> <b>electrode</b> {{coupled with a}} counter-electrode. As with the Clark electrode, a permselective {{membrane}} covers the Pt electrode. Now, however, the membrane is impregnated with immobilized glucose oxidase (GOx). The GOx will consume some of the oxygen as it diffuses towards the PT electrode, incorporating it into H2O2 and gluconic acid. The rate of reaction current {{is limited by the}} diffusion of both glucose and oxygen. This diffusion can be well characterized for a membrane for both the oxygen and glucose, leaving as the only variable the oxygen and glucose concentrations on the analyte-side of the glucose membrane, which is the quantity being measured.|$|E

50|$|The {{electrolyte}} can be O2− conducting and/or proton(H+) conducting. The {{state of}} the art for O2− conducting yttria stabilized zirconia(YSZ) based SORFC using Ni-YSZ as the hydrogen electrode and LSM (or LSM-YSZ) as the <b>oxygen</b> <b>electrode</b> has been actively studied. Dönitz and Erdle reported on the operation of YSZ electrolyte cells with current densities of 0.3 A cm−2 and 100% Faraday efficiency at only 1.07 V. The recent study by researchers from Sweden shows that ceria-based composite electrolytes, where both proton and oxide ion conductions exist, produce high current output for fuel cell operation and high hydrogen output for electrolysis operation. Zirconia doped with scandia and ceria (10Sc1CeSZ) is also investigated as potential electrolyte in SORFC for hydrogen production at intermediate temperatures(500-750°C).It is reported that 10Sc1CeSZ shows good behavior and produces high current densities, with suitable electrodes.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Reduced {{graphene}} oxide (RGO) {{was obtained}} by chemical synthesis from multi walled carbon nanotubes. Using a suitable oxidant, we longitudinally “unzipped ” nanotubes to form graphene oxide nanoribbons and then obtained RGO with a proper reductant. Standard redox potentials of carboxy groups were used for choosing oxidant and reductant. It {{has been shown that}} the required oxidant potential in acid medium should be more + 0. 528 V and reductant potential in alkaline medium- less – 1. 148 V. Current-potential curves for <b>oxygen</b> <b>electrodes</b> based on RGO, obtained by using the oxidants K 2 Cr 2 O 7, KMnO 4 and the reductants NaH 2 PO 2, Na 2 SO 3, were analyzed.

30|$|A {{method for}} the {{chemical}} synthesis of reduced graphene oxide has been developed. It {{is based on}} the chemical oxidation of multiwalled carbon nanotubes by means of heptavalent manganese with subsequent reduction. Sodium hypophosphite and sulfite were used as reductants. It has been confirmed by different methods that reduced graphene oxide is obtained. Current-potential curves for electrodes based on reduced graphene oxide in an oxygen fuel cell mock-up with alkaline electrolyte have been studied. It has been found that the characteristics of the electrode of graphene oxide reduced with sodium hypophosphite in oxygen reduction reaction are three to four times higher than those of the electrode of starting multiwalled carbon nanotubes. The electrodes based on reduced graphene oxide are superior to multiwalled carbon nanotube-MnO 2 composite in characteristics. The characteristics of <b>oxygen</b> <b>electrodes</b> based on reduced graphene oxide were stable during 6 -month tests. The reduced graphene oxide obtained promises much as a material for the <b>oxygen</b> <b>electrodes</b> of electrochemical power sources.|$|R
30|$|It {{has been}} found that the {{characteristics}} of the RGO-SH <b>electrode</b> in <b>oxygen</b> reduction reaction are three to four times higher than those of the electrode of starting MCNTs.

The characteristics of RGO-based <b>oxygen</b> <b>electrodes</b> were stable in the course of 6 -month tests.|$|R
5000|$|Lanthanum {{strontium}} manganate (LSM) is {{the most}} common <b>oxygen</b> <b>electrode</b> material. LSM offers high performance under electrolysis conditions due to generation of oxygen vacancies under anodic polarization that aid oxygen diffusion. [...] In addition, impregnating LSM electrode with GDC nanoparticles was found to increase cell lifetime by preventing delamination at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The exact mechanism by how this happen needs to be explore further. In a 2010 study, it was found that neodymium nickelate as an anode material provided 1.7 times the current density of typical LSM anodes when integrated into a commercial SOEC and operated at 700 °C, and approximately 4 times the current density when operated at 800 °C. The increased performance is postulated to be due to higher [...] "overstoichimoetry" [...] of oxygen in the neodymium nickelate, making it a successful conductor of both ions and electrons.|$|E
5000|$|Pt/C {{seems to}} be the best electrocatalyst for O2 {{evolution}} and Au/C for O2 reduction when [...] is the product (Lu, Xu et al. 2010). Nevertheless, “the performance of rechargeable lithium-air batteries with non-aqueous electrolytes is limited by the reactions on the <b>oxygen</b> <b>electrode,</b> especially by O2 evolution… Conventional porous carbon air electrodes are unable to provide mAh/g and mAh/cm2 capacities and discharge rates at the magnitudes required for really high energy density batteries for EV applications.” (Lu, Xu, et al. 2010) The capacity (in mAh/cm2) and the cycle life of the non-aqueous Li-O2 batteries is limited by the deposition of insoluble and poorly electronically conducting LiOx phases upon discharge (Balaish, Kraytsberg et al. 2014). ( [...] is predicted to have a better Li+ conductivity than the LiO2 and [...] phases) (Shi, Xu et al. 2015). This makes the practical specific energy of Li-O2 batteries significantly smaller than the reagent-level calculation predicts. It seems that these parameters have reached their limits by now, and further improvement can be expected only from alternative methods.|$|E
30|$|Studies {{have shown}} that the {{state-of-the-art}} SOFC materials could be directly employed in an SOEC, with Ni/YSZ (8  mol% Y 2 O 3 stabilized ZrO 2) cermet hydrogen electrode, YSZ oxygen-ion conducting electrolyte, and perovskite LSM (Sr-doped LaMnO 3) and/or LSM–YSZ <b>oxygen</b> <b>electrode</b> (Kim-Lohsoontorn et al. 2010; Chen et al. 2012 a). Delamination at the oxygen electrode/electrolyte interface was reported {{to be one of the}} most important problems causing the performance degradation and cell failure for an SOEC (Keane et al. 2012; Kim et al. 2013). Virkar (2010) reported that the high oxygen pressure developed inside the electrolyte near the air electrode could lead to the delamination of the <b>oxygen</b> <b>electrode.</b> Chen et al. (2010) systematically studied the polarization behavior and delamination mechanism of LSM <b>oxygen</b> <b>electrode</b> under SOEC operation conditions. They characterized the <b>oxygen</b> <b>electrode</b> and electrolyte interface by SEM and the results indicated that the delamination of LSM <b>oxygen</b> <b>electrode</b> was caused by the disintegration of the LSM particles at the <b>oxygen</b> <b>electrode</b> and electrolyte interfaces (Chen and Jiang 2011). Knibbe et al. (2009) studied the degradation behavior of SOEC under high current densities and suggested that the degradation was ascribed to the nucleation and growth of oxygen clusters in the YSZ grain boundaries near the <b>oxygen</b> <b>electrode.</b> Keane et al. (2012) fabricated symmetric air/LSM//YSZ//LSM/air cells and measured electrical performance degradation with time at various applied voltage ranging from 0 to 0.8  V with respect to OCV. After test, a developed weak oxygen electrode–electrolyte interface resulting from the delamination between the <b>oxygen</b> <b>electrode</b> and electrolyte was observed. Microstructural analysis of the oxygen electrode–electrolyte interface indicated the formation of lanthanum zirconate and morphological changes at the interface.|$|E
