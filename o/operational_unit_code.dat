By switching to the [...] "State" [...] channel, any two CDF radios statewide could communicate.

The {{major part of the}} paper is introducing a new way of <b>unit</b> <b>code</b> testing by clubbing of <b>unit</b> <b>code</b> test and Integration test into one unit. In this testing the main aim is to reduce the errors occur in the code and while integration. While in the KRS test approach we try to increase the efficiency of the testing with the help of KRS <b>unit</b> <b>code</b> test. This new approach is built only by considering the KRS <b>unit</b> <b>code</b> test. I...|$|R

50|$|The Civil Protection {{consists}} of a central direction in Brussels and six <b>operational</b> <b>units</b> spread across the Belgian territory. Each <b>operational</b> <b>unit</b> {{is responsible for the}} interventions in their area. Some <b>operational</b> <b>units</b> are specialized in certain areas, mostly dependent on their location (for example underground search and rescue). As of 2016, the Belgian Civil Protection employs about 1,100 people, of which 450 professionals and 650 volunteers, and operates almost 670 vehicles. In 2016, it also undertook about 5,500 interventions.|$|R

40|$|Planning is an {{important}} process in mining extraction to achieve long-term goals, or to fulfil contracts with their clients. Mining operations typically involve a number of <b>operational</b> <b>units,</b> each independently responsible for the delivery of a product subject to nominated performance specifications. In order to meet any performance targets for the overall operation, these <b>operational</b> <b>units</b> cannot work in isolation, and cooperation among them is required. To tackle this problem, the question we face is: how best to meet the performance targets of the overall mining operation subject to {{the limitations of the}} <b>operational</b> <b>units.</b> We will describe a decision support tool {{that could be used to}} simplify the process of coordinating the outputs of several <b>operational</b> <b>units</b> to meet a global target, and improve the quality of these plans. 1...|$|R
