5000|$|The key {{difference}} between a reversion and a remainder is that a reversion is held by the grantor of the <b>original</b> <b>conveyance,</b> whereas [...] "remainder" [...] is {{used to refer to}} an interest that would be a reversion, but is instead transferred to someone other than the grantor. Similarly to reversions, remainders are usually created in conjunction with a life estate, life estate pur autre vie, or fee tail estate (or a future interest that will eventually become one of these estates).|$|E
50|$|When the Beach O' Pines {{development}} was originally undertaken, a 5 acre parcel was withheld from the <b>original</b> <b>conveyance.</b> The original holding company was dissolved in 1963, {{and it was}} determined in 2011 that that land escheated to the Crown. It was conveyed to the Municipality of Lambton Shores that year {{for use as a}} greenspace. There have also been issues with the Municipality relating to the status of several road allowances and a towpath along the Old Ausable River Channel, that {{are in the process of}} being resolved.|$|E
5000|$|The rule never {{applies to}} {{conditions}} {{placed on a}} conveyance to a charity that, if violated, would convey the property to another charity. For example, a conveyance [...] "to the Red Cross, {{so long as it}} operates an office on the property, but if it does not, then to the World Wildlife Fund" [...] would be valid under the rule, because both parties are charities. Even though the interest of the Fund might not vest for hundreds of years, the conveyance would nonetheless be held valid. The exception, however, does not apply if the conveyance, upon violation of the condition, is not from one charity to another charity. Thus, a devise [...] "to John Smith, so long as no one operates a liquor store on the premises, but if someone does operate a liquor store on the premises, then to the Roman Catholic Church" [...] would violate the rule. The exception would not apply to the transfer from John Smith to the Roman Catholic Church because John Smith is not a charity. Also, if the <b>original</b> <b>conveyance</b> was [...] "to John Smith and his heirs for as long as John Smith does not use the premises to sell liquor, but if he does, then to the Red Cross" [...] this would violate the rule because it could be more than 21 years before the interest in Red Cross would vest, and therefore, their interest is void. Thus leaving John with a fee simple determinable and the grantor a possibility of reverter.|$|E

2500|$|Having {{established}} liability, {{the litigation}} {{turned to the}} remedy. [...] In 1999, McCurn ruled on the appropriate method to calculate damages. [...] The court rejected the state's arguments that damages {{should be limited to}} the fair market value of the land {{at the time of the}} transaction, without pre-judgement interest (the approximate method used by the Indian Claims Commission for statutory claims against the federal government). That same year, the court rejected ejectment as a remedy, thus ensuring that the Cayuga would be unable to recover possession of the lands; their remedy would be limited to monetary damages. The court also determined that joint and several liability would be inappropriate, and thus that the defendants would require separate trials. Finally, the court determined that the state would be able to offset from the eventual damages any amount of consideration paid in the <b>original</b> <b>conveyances</b> as well as the value of infrastructure improvements; moreover, the plaintiff's anthropologist's testimony would not be admissible on the question of valuation, the jury would not be able to hear evidence on laches from either party, the Eleventh Amendment would not bar damages, and the plaintiffs would not be able to claim emotional, psychological, or cultural damagesonly the economic value of the land.|$|R
5000|$|When {{an owner}} of land in fee simple died, {{the lord of the}} fee was {{entitled}} to [...] "incidents of tenure" [...] deriving from the descent to the heir (analogous to the modern day estate tax). Large landowners who desired the life tenant (who was perhaps the landowner himself, conveying through a straw party) to avoid the estate tax attempted to create a future interest {{in the form of a}} remainder in the heirs of that life tenant. It was the intention of the landowner or testator to allow the heirs of the life tenant, once ascertained at the natural expiration of his life estate, to take as purchasers by way of the <b>original</b> executed <b>conveyance,</b> and not by descent, avoiding the tax.|$|R
40|$|A sharp {{discontinuity}} in {{the administration}} of Hawaii's unique land laws has created uncertainty as to the ownership of geothermal resources in the state. Until Hawaii was annexed to the United States and governed under the Organic Act of 1900, mineral rights had with rare exception been reserved to the government, even though the statutory requirement for making the reservation had been repealed in 1859. Beginning in 1900 and through 1955, the practice was reversed and lands were patented without mineral reservations [...] even some lands which had originally been granted subject to a reservation. Further, the Land Court created by the Territory issued certificates of titles to lands registered under the Torrens system, omitting mineral reservations made at the time of <b>original</b> <b>conveyance</b> by the government. It is unclear whether reservations are to be implied in {{some or all of the}} titles issued without express reservation clauses. The uncertainty is compounded by contradictory arguments which can be readily made as to whether mineral reservations in Hawaii encompassed geothermal resources in grants made prior to a 1974 statute which states that they do. The Hawaii Supreme Court has recently shown a receptivity to social policy arguments, while in parallel cases regarding ownership of natural resources, the federal District Court in Hawaii has been the more protective of private property rights under the 14 th amendment.

50|$|Due to {{the high}} rate of {{sediment}} deposition that surpasses the federally-mandated total maximum daily load, Los Peñasquitos Lagoon is listed as a category 5 impaired body of water under section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act. This is primarily due to the adverse effects of sedimentation in the lagoon itself and also within its vast watershed. These effects include drops in photosynthetic productivity, higher concentrations of heavy metals, and overall loss of ecosystem biodiversity within the estuary. In addition to ecological impacts, sedimentation in the Los Peñasquitos watershed has led to significant issues within its storm water infrastructure. Specifically, sediment accumulation in flood control channels has greatly reduced <b>original</b> storm water <b>conveyance</b> capacity. This is primarily due to the vegetation that grows within the channels as a result of siltation. Regular maintenance of these channels by the Storm Water Division is therefore a necessity to ensure proper flood control. Despite the need for sufficient flood control through regular channel maintenance, the extensive permitting process involved requires selection and planning that extends nearly two years before any service activities.|$|R

Initially transactions made only with the intention of depriving creditors of assets, or perverting the priorities for order of distribution were vulnerable, while the modern approach of the Insolvency Act 1986 contains more provisions that unwind transactions simply because their effect is deprivation of assets available to creditors. Reminiscent of the 1571 Act, under the Insolvency Act 1986 section 423, a company may recover assets if they were paid away for [...] "significantly less than the value" [...] of the thing, and this was done [...] "for the purpose of" [...] prejudicing other creditors' interests. In Arbuthnot Leasing International Ltd v Havelet Leasing Ltd (No 2) Scott J held that the motive of the company or its directors was irrelevant, so that even though Havelet Leasing Ltd's lawyers had advised (quite wrongly) that their scheme of starting another company and transferring assets to it would be lawful, because the scheme's purpose was to put the assets out of other creditors' reach it breached section 423.|$|R
