5|$|All new {{subsidiary}} legislation must {{be sent to}} the Council for scrutiny within 14 days of their publication in the Government Gazette. The Council is then required to make its report to the Speaker and the appropriate Minister within 30 days. However, unlike with bills, there is no provision to extend the original deadline. As with bills, tardiness in sending an adverse report results in a conclusive presumption that the Council finds no differentiating measures in the {{subsidiary legislation}}. Where the Council issues an adverse report, the Minister must revoke or amend the offending provision within six months <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>report,</b> unless Parliament passes a resolution confirming that provision.|$|E
5|$|As a {{consequence}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>report,</b> Hordaland County Municipality demanded an extraordinary annual meeting {{be held in}} February, in which chairman Harry Herstad was replaced. Pål Kårbø was elected new chairman. At {{the same time the}} annual meeting demanded that the company withdraw from its various tasks related to establishing toll projects on Bølmo and Halsnøy as well as administrative work of the Norwegian Road Financing Companies Association. In a 2007 report from the Public Roads Administration, SBT was one of seven toll companies which was criticized for too high administration costs. The toll changed the operator of the toll plaza from Bru- og Tunnelselskapet to Vegamot in 2010. The same year the toll plaza had 1,910,280 passing vehicles and a revenue of NOK142 million. This made it the ninth-largest toll road in Norway by revenue. The toll collection was scheduled to be completed on 30 April 2013.|$|E

Local independent MP, Rob Oakeshott said, however, that the Council should instead address the findings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>report,</b> and stop arguing about the facts or using emotional arguments in support of it.

5|$|Espejo {{realized}} that the charges against the clergy were so serious {{that he had to}} focus on destroying Barreto's credibility. Therefore, he implied that Barreto's own conduct was outrageous because of his excesses in collecting taxes and his habit of paying public funds to licentious women. Additionally, he stated that the real author <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>report</b> was José Miguel Vallejo, whom he called an immoral man who despised the clergy. Thus, Espejo claimed the report should not be believed.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, Bute {{asked his}} chief Cardiff engineer, John McConnochie, to {{excavate}} and clear the castle ruins. The {{report on the}} investigations was produced by William Burges, an architect {{with an interest in}} medieval architecture who had met Bute in 1865. The Marquess subsequently employed him to redevelop Cardiff Castle in the late 1860s, and the two men became close collaborators. Burges's lavishly illustrated report, which drew extensively on Clark's earlier work, laid out two options: either conserve the ruins or rebuild the castle to create a house for occasional occupation in the summer. On receipt <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>report,</b> Bute commissioned Burges to rebuild Castle Coch in a Gothic Revival style.|$|E
