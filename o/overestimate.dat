5|$|Also, whilst {{productivity}} {{figures have}} improved, median incomes and stock market prices, {{and thus the}} returns to capital and labor, have not improved. Furthermore, government consumption (government activity excluding transfer payments) represents between 15–20% of GDP, but since the sector is measured at cost it becomes less and less productive as it grows larger. Thus, the more government consumption there is, the more published GDP figures tend to <b>overestimate</b> growth in living standards.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1914, Harlow Shapley began {{a series}} of studies of {{globular}} clusters, published in about 40 scientific papers. He examined the RR Lyrae variables in the clusters (which he assumed were Cepheid variables) and used their period–luminosity relationship for distance estimates. Later, it was found that RR Lyrae variables are fainter than Cepheid variables, which caused Shapley to <b>overestimate</b> the distances of the clusters.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this {{research}} we examine estimates of American social class mobility—the {{ability to move}} up or down in education and income status. Across studies, <b>overestimates</b> of class mobility were large and particularly likely among younger participants and those higher in subjective social class—both measured (Studies 1 – 3) and manipulated (Study 4). Class mobility <b>overestimates</b> were independent of general estimation errors (Study 3) and persisted after accounting for knowledge of class mobility assessed in terms of educational attainment and self-ratings. Experiments revealed that mobility <b>overestimates</b> were shaped by exposure to information about the genetic determinants of social class—a faux science article suggesting genetic constraints to economic advancement increased accuracy in class mobility estimates (Study 2) —and motivated by needs to protect the self—heightening the self-relevance of class mobility increased <b>overestimates</b> (Study 3).

40|$|Previous {{research}} on building pre-tender cost estimating {{stresses the importance}} of giving accurate estimates and minimizing estimating errors. Cost models, especially those mathematical models using mean square error or the like for model training and validation, often treat positive errors (<b>overestimates)</b> and negative errors (underestimates) of equal magnitude the same with an implicit assumption that the regret or disutility of positive errors (<b>overestimates)</b> is equal to that of negative errors (underestimates). A survey was conducted in Hong Kong to study estimating practice and in particular, the attitude of clients and estimators towards estimating errors. This involved the use of regression analysis to model the relative disutility of underestimates (in terms of <b>overestimates)</b> for four different building types. Both clients and estimators are found to be risk averse—tolerating <b>overestimates</b> more than underestimates—and, arguably, clients are satisfied with <b>overestimates.</b> However, they have contrasting views on the desired characteristics of estimates with clients considering the ability to identify cost sensitive elements to be more important than accuracy. In this regard, the formalization of value analysis as part of the cost advice function under typical cost consulting agreements should be the best form of improvement.

5|$|Among {{the main}} reasons that experts cite for causing {{negative}} effects from yoga are beginners' competitiveness and instructors' lack of qualification. As the demand for yoga classes grows, many people get certified to become yoga instructors, often with relatively little training. Not every newly certified instructor can evaluate the condition of every new trainee in their class and recommend refraining from doing certain poses or using appropriate props to avoid injuries. In turn, a beginning yoga student can <b>overestimate</b> the abilities of their body and strive to do advanced poses before their body is flexible or strong enough to perform them.|$|E
5|$|In a {{range of}} studies, {{participants}} have been requested to answer general knowledge questions, each of which had two possible answers, and also to estimate their chances of answering each question correctly. If the participants had a sufficient degree of self-knowledge, their level of confidence in regard to each answer they gave would be high for the questions they answered correctly and lower for the ones they answered wrong. However, this generally is not the case. Many people are overconfident; indeed, studies show that most people systematically <b>overestimate</b> their own abilities. Moreover, people are overconfident {{about their ability to}} answer questions that are deemed to be hard but underconfident on questions that are considered easy.|$|E

Between the blood lead levels of 5 and 35μg/dL, an IQ decrease of 2–4 points for each μg/dL increase is reported in children. However, studies that show associations between low-level lead exposure and health effects in children may be affected by confounding and <b>overestimate</b> the effects of low-level lead exposure.|$|E

5|$|According to the classicist J. C.

In Rome, even when led by a bold Tribune the people lacked anywhere near the influence they enjoyed {{at the height of the}} Athenian polis. Another problem for Gaius's aims was that the Roman constitution, specifically the Tribal Assembly, was designed to prevent any one individual governing for a sustained period of time – and there were several other checks and balances to prevent power being concentrated on any one person. Stobart adds that another reason for the efforts' failures was the Gracchi's idealism; they were deaf to the baser notes of human nature and failed to recognize how corrupt and selfish all sections of Roman society had become.|$|E
5|$|Early on, paleontologists {{considered}} Macroolithus nests to {{have been}} buried. Mou 1992 noted the high gas conductance values in Macroolithus eggs and therefore concluded that they were laid in a very humid environment, buried underground or inside a mound. Deeming (2006) found a similar result. This seems to contradict evidence that oviraptorosaurids brooded bird-like on their eggs, but Deeming suggested that Oviraptor buried its eggs in a mound and then Oviraptor and its relatives sat atop a nest mound to incubate, rather than directly contacting the eggs. However, Tanaka et al. (2015) criticized these results for lack of statistical rigor. They found, based on comparisons to modern eggs, that Macroolithus was predicted to be laid in open or partially covered nests. Wiemann et al. (2017) also criticized Mou and Deeming because they had only measured eggshell porosity at the middle section of the eggs and did {{not take into account}} the fact that the pore density is much lower near the poles. This would lead to an <b>overestimate</b> of the total eggshell porosity and therefore an overstimate of the gas conductance value.|$|E
5|$|For the battle, Rotmistrov {{ordered his}} tanks {{to move forward}} at high speed to engage the German armour in order to nullify the {{advantages}} the Tiger tanks had in the range and firepower of their 88mm guns. He believed the more manoeuvrable T-34 medium tanks {{would be able to}} quickly close in and obtain effective flanking shots against the German heavy tanks. In fact, Soviet intelligence had greatly overestimated the numbers of Ferdinands and Tigers possessed by the II SS-Panzer Corps. In actuality there were no Ferdinands with the 4th Panzer Army or Army Group South, as they were all deployed on the northern side of the Kursk salient with the 9th Army. Soviet tank-crews frequently mistook the versions of Panzer IV tanks that were armed with the KwK 40 anti-tank gun, which also had extra armour added to their turret, for Tigers; therefore Soviet reports tended to <b>overestimate</b> the number of Tigers employed by the German side during the Battle of Kursk.|$|E

40|$|In this contribution, two {{investigations}} on teachers’ diagnostic {{competence and}} the motivational-affective characteristics of underestimated and <b>overestimated</b> students are presented. Each time, eight elementary school classes and their mathematics teachers participated in investigations in Germany and China. The fourth graders {{worked on a}} mathematics achievement test and a self-description questionnaire. Teachers estimated students’ test performance as well as motivational-affective characteristics. The distinction between underestimated and <b>overestimated</b> students was made on basis of the estimated and the real test performance. Both investigations have concurrent results. Teachers could predict test achievement with good accuracy, but had difficulties to assess students’ motivational-affective characteristics. Underestimated students showed the same test performance and learning motivation as <b>overestimated</b> students, but had lower expectancy for success, lower self-concept of ability and higher test anxiety. Teachers expected that underestimated students would get worse grades on the next mathematics test and would be satisfied with lower grades than <b>overestimated</b> students. Teachers’judgment error did not confine to test performance but generalized to students’ motivational-affective characteristics...|$|R

Larger females may have larger litters. Animals become sexually mature when less than two months old; in Fleming's study, some females in juvenile fur, probably less than 50days old, were already pregnant.

5|$|The {{effects of}} wind shear finally took their toll late on January 4, and Zeta's {{convection}} began to die down. This led to Tropical Storm Zeta weakening to a minimal tropical storm.

Zeta continued to move west-northwestward, barely holding on to tropical storm status before becoming disorganized again. Zeta weakened into a tropical depression on January 6 and dissipated into a remnant later that day. With this transition, the very active 2005 hurricane season finally came to a close. The remnant low retained its identity for a further day before it dissipated 660miles (1060km) southeast of Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|All figures quoted for {{the losses}} of the cavalry brigades {{as a result}} of this charge are estimates, as {{casualties}} were only noted down after the day of the battle and were for the battle as a whole. Some historians, Barbero for example, believe the official rolls tend to <b>overestimate</b> the number of cavalrymen present in their squadrons on the field of battle and that the proportionate losses were, as a result, considerably higher than the numbers on paper might suggest. The Union Brigade lost heavily in both officers and men killed (including its commander, William Ponsonby, and Colonel Hamilton of the Scots Greys) and wounded. The 2nd Life Guards and the King's Dragoon Guards of the Household Brigade also lost heavily (with Colonel Fuller, commander of the King's DG, killed). However, the 1st Life Guards, on the extreme right of the charge, and the Blues, who formed a reserve, had kept their cohesion and consequently suffered significantly fewer casualties. On the rolls the official, or paper strength, for both Brigades is given as 2,651 while Barbero and others estimate the actual strength at around 2,000 and the official recorded losses for the two heavy cavalry brigades during the battle was 1,205 troopers and 1,303 horses.|$|E
