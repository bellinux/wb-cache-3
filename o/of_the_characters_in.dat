5|$|Minnesota's winters are {{the setting}} of several {{television}} programs and Hollywood films, including the 1996 film Fargo which features the backdrop of a Minnesota winter, but like most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>in</b> the movie, the climate is portrayed as bleak and inhospitable.|$|E
5|$|Zamoyski was {{the subject}} of several {{paintings}} and drawings. Most notably, he is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>in</b> two large paintings by Jan Matejko, featured on the Skarga's Sermon and Batory at Pskov.|$|E
5|$|Another voice actor {{recruited}} was Mel Blanc, {{best remembered}} for voicing many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>in</b> Warner Bros. cartoon shorts. Blanc {{was hired to}} perform the voice of Gideon the Cat. However, it was eventually decided that Gideon would be mute, so all of Blanc's recorded dialogue was subsequently deleted except for a solitary hiccup, which was heard {{three times in the}} finished film.|$|E

Two image albums, comprising several songs sung by Japanese voice actors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>in</b> the animation, were also released. Several theme music were performed by pop musicians such as B'z, Zard, and Garnet Crow.

5|$|The Simpson {{family first}} {{appeared}} as shorts in The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987. Groening submitted only basic sketches to the animators and {{assumed that the}} figures would be cleaned up in production.

5|$|Balzac {{had written}} more than seventy novels {{when he began}} La Cousine Bette, and {{populated}} them with recurring characters. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>in</b> the novel, therefore, appear with extensive back-stories and biographical depth. For example, Célestin Crevel first appeared in Balzac's 1837 novel César Birotteau, working for the title character. Having accumulated a considerable fortune in that book, Crevel spends his time in La Cousine Bette enjoying the spoils of his labor. Another important recurring character is Marshal Hulot, who first appeared as a colonel in Les Chouans. In the years between that story and La Cousine Bette, he became the Count of Forzheim; {{in a letter to}} the Constitutionnel, Balzac described how Marshal Hulot gained this title. The presence of Crevel and Marshal Hulot– among others– in La Cousine Bette allows a continuation of each character's life story, adding emphasis or complexity to earlier events.|$|E
5|$|Chakrapani {{decided to}} retain only the {{background}} of Gundamma's family from the original and rewrote the remaining script, taking inspiration from William Shakespeare comedy, The Taming of the Shrew. Chakrapani killed the character of Gundamma's cowardly husband because he felt that a husband who cannot answer his wife's questions is not eligible to be included. Kamalakara Kameswara Rao was chosen to direct the film. Chakrapani named the central character Gundamma in the remake after one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>in</b> the original, {{despite a lack of}} nativity. Nagi Reddy's family members and the employees of the Vijaya Vauhini Studios used to ask him Gundamma Katha Entha varaku vachchindi? ("What is the progress in Gundamma's story?"), which prompted Nagi Reddy to title the film Gundamma Katha after considering various options.|$|E

5|$|Cheri Montesanto-Medcalf and Matthew Mungle, the show's make-up effect producers, used several unorthodox {{ingredients}} {{to create the}} effect of melted flesh; {{in addition to the}} use of normal prosthetic make-up, the two also used a combination of figs and Fruit Roll-Ups. Several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>in</b> the episode were named after real-life individuals. The characters of Hellura Lyle and Kai Bowe were named after two Writers Guild trainees on The X-Files staff who served during {{the first part of the}} eighth season. Furthermore, the character Steven Melnick is named after the Vice President of Media Relations for 20th Century Fox Television. Melnick had formerly served as the publicist for the series.|$|E
5|$|Fleming was {{not happy}} with the book, owing to the {{reactions}} by critics and fans, and attempted to suppress elements of it where he could: he blocked a paperback edition in the United Kingdom and only gave permission for the title to be used when he sold the film rights to Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli, rather than any aspects of the plots. However, a British paperback edition was published after his death, and the Bond film character of Jaws is loosely based on one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>in</b> the book.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>in</b> Carmen—the soldiers, the smugglers, the Gypsy {{women and}} the {{secondary}} leads Micaëla and Escamillo—are reasonably familiar types within the opéra comique tradition, although drawing them from proletarian life was unusual. The two principals, José and Carmen, lie outside the genre. While each is presented quite differently from Mérimée's portrayals of a murderous brigand and a treacherous, amoral schemer, even in their relatively sanitised forms neither corresponds to the norms of opéra comique. They are more akin to the verismo style that would find fuller expression {{in the works of}} Puccini.|$|E

5|$|On December 21, 1981, the Tony Award-winning musical Dreamgirls {{opened at}} the Imperial Theatre on Broadway and ran for 1,522 performances. The musical, loosely based {{on the history of}} the Supremes, follows the story of the Dreams, an all-female singing trio from Chicago who become music superstars. Several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>in</b> the play are analogues of real-life Supremes/Motown counterparts, with the story {{focusing}} upon the Florence Ballard doppelgänger Effie White. While influenced by the Supremes' and Motown's music, the songs in the play are a broader mix of R/soul and Broadway music. Mary Wilson loved the musical, but Diana Ross was reportedly angered by it and refused to see it.|$|E

Groening submitted only basic sketches to the animators and {{assumed that the}} figures would be cleaned up in production. However, the animators merely re-traced his drawings, {{which led to the}} crude appearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>in</b> the initial shorts. The animation was produced domestically at Klasky Csupo, with Wes Archer, David Silverman, and Bill Kopp being animators for the first season. Colorist Gyorgyi Peluce was the person who decided to make the characters yellow.|$|E
5|$|The {{film has}} {{a handful of}} {{differences}} from Rubel's original work. Many character names were changed for the film, including Cliff Monroe to Steven Monroe, Puff Gordon to Ed Gordon, and Nancy Starweather to Nancy Richards. Additionally, the majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>in</b> the film were nameless in the book. The ending was also tweaked. In the novel, Monroe professes his love for Nancy Starweather and they happily marry in Painted Springs. In the film, this does not happen, and Monroe just leaves the area.|$|E

40|$|In <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{practical}} industrial location, {{the assembly}} industry {{plays an important}} roll recently. But with the industrial location theory that {{has so far been}} established only on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economics, <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> assembly industry cannot be strictly explained thereby. Therefore this study was held for <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> pursueing <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> assembly industry. This is <b>the</b> report <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study. <b>The</b> report consists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> following two parts: (1) Analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> location.

5|$|The {{stories were}} written when Irish {{nationalism}} {{was at its}} peak and {{a search for a}} national identity and purpose was raging; at a crossroads of history and culture, Ireland was jolted by converging ideas and influences. The stories centre on Joyce's idea of an epiphany: a moment when a character experiences a life-changing self-understanding or illumination. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>in</b> Dubliners later appear in minor roles in Joyce's novel Ulysses. The initial stories in the collection are narrated by child protagonists. Subsequent stories deal with the lives and concerns of progressively older people. This aligns with Joyce's tripartite division of the collection into childhood, adolescence and maturity.|$|E
5|$|Dungeon Siege is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game developed by Gas Powered Games {{and published by}} Microsoft Game Studios on April 5, 2002, for Microsoft Windows, and the following year for MacOS. Set in the pseudo-medieval kingdom of Ehb, the high fantasy game follows a young farmer and his companions as they journey to defeat an invading force. Initially only seeking to warn {{the nearby town of}} the invasion of a race of creatures named the Krug, the farmer and the companions that join him along the way are soon swept up in finding a way to defeat another race called the Seck, resurgent after being trapped for 300 years. Unlike other role-playing video games of the time, the world of Dungeon Siege does not have levels but is a single, continuous area without loading screens that the player journeys through, fighting hordes of enemies. Also, rather than setting character classes and manually controlling all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>in</b> the group, the player controls their overall tactics and weapons and magic usage, which direct their character growth.|$|E
5|$|Early {{shooting}} {{put more}} {{focus on the}} pool playing, but during filming Rossen {{made the decision to}} place more emphasis on the love story between Newman and Laurie's characters. Despite the change in emphasis, Rossen still used the various pool games to show the strengthening of Eddie's character and the evolution of his relationship to Bert and Sarah, through the positioning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>in</b> the frame. For example, when Eddie is playing Findley, Eddie is positioned below Bert in a two shot but above Findley while still below Bert in a three shot. When Sarah enters the room, she is below Eddie in two shot while in a three shot Eddie is still below Bert. When Eddie is kneeling over Sarah's body, Bert again appears above him but Eddie attacks Bert, ending up on top of him. Eddie finally appears above Bert in two shot when Eddie returns to beat Fats.|$|E
