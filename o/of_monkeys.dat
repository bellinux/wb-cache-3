5|$|The sandbar of Carabane {{has very}} few mammals other than pets, {{although}} the French first noted the presence <b>of</b> <b>monkeys</b> in 1835. In 1870, other settlers noted with disgust that the natives often ate monkeys and dogs. In the early 21st century, bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are commonly sighted off the island. The lack of tourism {{because of the}} civil unrest has benefited biodiversity. In this way, the nearby Basse Casamance National Park, which has been closed for years, has seen a remarkable return of Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus), Senegalese manatees (Trichechus senegalensis), and breeding birds.|$|E

5|$|There are {{grotesque}} {{figures of}} vetalas (ghosts) on the pilasters of jaga mohan {{and on the}} faces of vimana of the temple.

On the outermost frame around the latticed window of the jaganamohana, delightful scenes <b>of</b> <b>monkeys</b> playing all manners of pranks are depicted. The vimana of the temple is a triratha with a distant semblance of a Pancharatha as evident from the projecting niches flanking the central projection. The bada of the vimana abruptly starts from the talapatna or pavement which consists of three elements instead of the usual five and encloses a parallelepiped instead of the usual cubic sanctum.|$|E
