40|$|The essay {{outlines}} the birth and devolopment of the Ufficio arisen in 1419, {{in spite of}} previous sporadic episodes and different historiographical interpretations. The Ufficio was designed by the civil and religious power and was composed by the archibishop and four lay members elected by the civil authorities with aim of seeking, defending and distributing pious legacies of citizens. In such a way the Ufficio takes shape as a magistrature of the Commune with full administrative and judicial jurisdiction {{in the field of}} charity, so that in 1482 the archibishop urge the Pope for the aknowledgement of all the proceedings issued in favor of the institution. The Ufficio witnesses that civic religion characterising Italy of XV Century. Thanks to the broader responsibilities assigned to it – redemption of captives, appointment of the Genoese consul in Alexandria of Egypt, protection of abandoned children, administration of hospitals –, the Ufficio becomes also an actual economic power by virtue of management of pious legacies concentrated in the Bank of St. George so as to be defined an <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange.</b> The Ufficio carries on an active solidarity, by supporting the establishment of local pawnshop too, transforms the scriptural money into cash and moves to the virtuous cycle of money every kind of pious legacy, of licit or illicit origin, making it available to the community in spite of many difficulties.  Indeed it works both against the interests of potential heirs and the public treasury that attempts to take possession of pious legacies...|$|E

40|$|Developed and {{maintained}} by the University Libraries, the Hub is the institutional repository of The University of Hong Kong (HKU). On top of its regular work to place HKU publications in open access, it has received funding from the HKU <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> Knowledge <b>Exchange</b> (KEO) to make HKU research and researchers highly visible on the web, {{with the aim of}} increasing all forms of collaboration, internally and externally. The Libraries extracted data from several internal HKU silos and external databases to create author profiles, or "HKU ResearcherPages" for each of the professoriate staff. These pages bring together in a public mashup, interlinking publication details, patent records, and grant applications, as well as details of community service, postgraduate student supervision, research interests, etc. Bibliometrics provided by Scopus and ResearcherID, as well as Hub generated view counts and download counts, cumulated to the article level, and to the author level, show that this work and these pages have increased visibility, and thus impact. Serendipitously this work has also received the attention and efforts of many HKU researchers, who now interact with Library staff and their ResearcherPages to ensure that their details are complete and shown in the best light. The Hub is therefore one tool by which a new culture and community <b>of</b> Knowledge <b>Exchange</b> is being forged at HKU. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
