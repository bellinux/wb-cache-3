25|$|As a remedy, we seek a {{sampling}} frame {{which has the}} property that we can identify every single element and include any in <b>our</b> <b>sample.</b> The most straightforward type of frame {{is a list of}} elements of the population (preferably the entire population) with appropriate contact information.
