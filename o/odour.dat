5|$|By 2007, Songpol Somsri, a Thai {{government}} scientist, had crossbred {{more than}} ninety varieties of durian to create Chantaburi No.1, a cultivar without the characteristic <b>odour.</b> Another hybrid, Chantaburi No. 3, develops the <b>odour</b> {{about three days}} after the fruit is picked, which enables an odourless transport yet satisfies consumers who prefer the pungent <b>odour.</b> On 22 May 2012, two other cultivars from Thailand that also lack the usual <b>odour,</b> Long Laplae and Lin Laplae, were presented to the public by Yothin Samutkhiri, governor of Uttaradit Province from where these cultivars were developed locally, while he announced the dates for the yearly durian fair of Laplae District, and the name giver to both cultivars.|$|E
5|$|Termites can {{distinguish}} nestmates and non-nestmates through chemical communication and gut symbionts: chemicals consisting of hydrocarbons {{released from the}} cuticle allow the recognition of alien termite species. Each colony has its own distinct <b>odour.</b> This <b>odour</b> {{is a result of}} genetic and environmental factors such as the termites' diet and the composition of the bacteria within the termites' intestines.|$|E
5|$|The kakapo has a {{well-developed}} {{sense of}} smell, which complements its nocturnal lifestyle. It can distinguish between odours while foraging, a behaviour reported {{in only one}} other parrot species. One {{of the most striking}} characteristics of the kakapo is its distinct musty-sweet <b>odour.</b> Given their well-developed sense of smell, this <b>odour</b> may be a pheromone. The smell often alerts predators to the presence of kakapos.|$|E
40|$|This study {{determined}} {{the extent to}} which re-exposure to the unique combination of <b>odours</b> present in a museum (the Jorvik Viking Centre in York) aids the recall of a previous visit to the museum, which had typically taken place several years earlier. To test this, three groups of participants completed questionnaires about the contents of the museum, but in different conditions. One group completed the questionnaire in the presence of exactly the same distinctive <b>odours</b> as those present in the museum {{at the time of their}} original visit. Those in two other groups were given either a different (control) set of <b>odours</b> or no <b>odours</b> at all. After a brief delay, the same questionnaire was presented again to participants in all three groups. Those who had initially been given a novel (control) set of <b>odours</b> were now tested in the presence of the genuine Jorvik museum <b>odours,</b> while the group that had received the Jorvik <b>odours</b> were now tested with the control <b>odours.</b> The third group received no <b>odours</b> on either test. Only the novel odour-Jorvik <b>odours</b> condition led to a highly significant improvement in performance. This interaction showed that the museum <b>odours</b> could act as effective retrieval cues for this incidentally acquired, real-world episode...|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} of migratory galaxiid juveniles, inanga (Galaxias maculatus) and koaro (G. brevipinnis), to the <b>odours</b> of adult galaxiids was {{tested in a}} two-choice chamber apparatus. Both conspecific and heterospecific <b>odours</b> were tested. Inanga juveniles were attracted to adult inanga (G. maculatus), banded kokopu (G. fasciatus), and koaro (G. brevipinnis) <b>odours.</b> However, they were not attracted to <b>odours</b> from common bullies (Gobiomorphus cotidianus). Koaro juveniles exhibited a species-specific attraction to adult koaro <b>odours</b> only. These results demonstrate inanga uveniles can discriminate and are attracted to adult galaxiids during their migratory phase, whilst migratory koaro juveniles exhibit a species-specific attraction to adult <b>odours</b> similar to the pheromonal attraction previously described for juvenile banded kokopu. This strengthens the hypothesis {{for the use of}} pheromonal cues in stream and habitat selection by amphidromous galaxiids...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the role of}} social <b>odours</b> in sexual arousal and maintaining pairbonds in biparental and cooperatively breeding primates. Social <b>odours</b> are complex chemical mixtures produced by an organism that can simultaneously provide information about species, kinship, sex, individuality and reproductive state. They are long lasting and have advantages over other modalities. Both sexes are sensitive to changes in <b>odours</b> over the reproductive cycle and experimental disruption of signals can lead to altered sexual behaviour within a pair. We demonstrate, using {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI), that social <b>odours</b> indicating reproductive state directly influence the brain areas responsible for sexual behaviour. Social <b>odours</b> also influence other brain areas typically involved in motivation, memory and decision making, suggesting that these signals have more complex functions in primates than mere sexual arousal. We demonstrate a rapid link between social <b>odours</b> and neuroendocrine responses that are modulated by a male's social status. Recent work on humans shows similar responses to social <b>odours.</b> We conclude with an integration of the importance of social <b>odours</b> on sexual arousal and maintaining pairbonds in socially biparental and cooperatively breeding species, suggesting new research directions to integrate social behaviour, neural activation and neuroendocrine responses...|$|R
5|$|Spongiforma is a genus of sponge-like {{fungi in}} the Boletaceae family. Newly {{described}} in 2009, the genus contains two species: S.thailandica and S.squarepantsii. The type species S.thailandica is known only from Khao Yai National Park in central Thailand, where it grows in soil in old-growth forests dominated by dipterocarp trees. The rubbery fruit bodies, {{which has a}} strong <b>odour</b> of coal-tar similar to Tricholoma sulphureum, consists of numerous internal cavities lined with spore-producing tissue. S.squarepantsii, described as new to science in 2011, is found in Malaysia. It produces sponge-like, rubbery orange fruit bodies with a fruity or musky <b>odour.</b> These fruit bodies will—like a sponge—resume their original shape if water is squeezed out. The origin of the specific name derives from its perceived resemblance to the cartoon character SpongeBob SquarePants. Apart from differences in distribution, S.squarepantsii differs from S.thailandica in its colour, <b>odour,</b> and spore structure.|$|E
5|$|The {{skin of a}} giraffe {{is mostly}} gray. Its {{thickness}} allows the animal to run through thorn bush without being punctured. The fur {{may serve as a}} chemical defence, as its parasite repellents give the animal a characteristic scent. At least 11 main aromatic chemicals are in the fur, although indole and 3-methylindole are responsible for most of the smell. Because the males have a stronger <b>odour</b> than the females, the <b>odour</b> may also have sexual function. Along the animal's neck is a mane made of short, erect hairs. The one-metre (3.3-ft) tail ends in a long, dark tuft of hair and is used as a defense against insects.|$|E

40|$|Folk wisdom often {{refers to}} <b>odours</b> as potent {{triggers}} for autobiographical memory, {{akin to the}} Proust phenomenon that describes Proust’s sudden recollection of a childhood memory when tasting a madeleine dipped into tea. Despite {{an increasing number of}} empirical studies on the effects of <b>odours</b> on cognition, conclusive evidence is still missing. We set out to examine the effectiveness of childhood and non-childhood <b>odours</b> as retrieval cues for autobiographical memories in a lab experiment. A total of 170 participants were presented with pilot-tested retrieval cues (either <b>odours</b> or images) to recall childhood memories and were then asked to rate the vividness, detail, and emotional intensity of these memories. Results showed that participants indeed reported richer memories when presented with childhood-related <b>odours</b> than childhood-related images or childhood-unrelated <b>odours</b> or images. An exploratory analysis of memory content with Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count did not reveal differences in affective content. The findings of this study support the notion that <b>odours</b> are particularly potent in eliciting rich memories and open up numerous avenues for further exploration...|$|R
40|$|<b>Odours</b> are {{important}} in emotional processing; yet relatively {{little is known about}} the representations of the affective qualities of <b>odours</b> in the human brain. We found that three pleasant and three unpleasant <b>odours</b> activated dissociable parts of the human brain. Pleasant but not unpleasant <b>odours</b> were found to activate a medial region of the rostral orbitofrontal cortex. Further, there was a correlation between the subjective pleasantness ratings of the six <b>odours</b> given during the investigation with activation of a medial region of the rostral orbitofrontal cortex. In contrast, a correlation between the subjective unpleasantness ratings of the six <b>odours</b> was found in regions of the left and more lateral orbitofrontal cortex. Moreover, a double dissociation was found with the intensity ratings of the <b>odours,</b> which were not correlated with the BOLD signal in the orbitofrontal cortex, but were correlated with the signal in medial olfactory cortical areas including the pyriform and anterior entorhinal cortex. Activation was also found in the anterior cingulate cortex, with a middle part of the anterior cingulate activated by both pleasant and unpleasant <b>odours,</b> and a more anterior part of the anterior cingulate cortex showing a correlation with the subjective pleasantness ratings of the <b>odours.</b> Thus the results suggest that there is a hedonic map of the sense of smell in brain regions such as the orbitofrontal cortex, and these results have implications for understanding the psychiatric and related problems that follow damage to these brain areas...|$|R
50|$|Communication {{in sugar}} gliders is {{achieved}} through vocalisations, visual signals and complex chemical <b>odours.</b> Chemical <b>odours</b> {{account for a}} large part of communication in sugar gliders, similar to many other nocturnal animals. <b>Odours</b> may be used to mark territory, convey health status of an individual, and mark rank of community members. Gliders produce a number of vocalisations including barking and hissing.|$|R
5|$|Aroma {{compounds}} {{are responsible}} for the particular <b>odour</b> or taste in some species, e.g. sotolon in the fenugreek-smelling Lactarius helvus, or the similar quabalactone III in Lactarius rubidus which causes a maple syrup-like <b>odour</b> in dried specimens. Pigments have been isolated from brightly coloured species, e.g. (7-isopropenyl-4-methylazulen-1-yl)methyl stearate from the blue Lactarius indigo or russulaflavidin and a derivative from the yellow Russula flavida. Some Russula species contain pigmented pteridine derivatives called russupteridines that are not found in the milk-caps. Sesquiterpenes are characteristic secondary metabolites of many Russulaceae, especially milk-caps which have been quite intensively studied. They are thought to be responsible for the hot taste in many species and may have deterrent, antifeeding functions in nature.|$|E
5|$|Many {{saltwater}} fish manufacture {{large amounts of}} trimethylamine oxide {{to protect them from}} the high osmotic effects of their environment; conversion of this compound to dimethylamine is responsible for the early <b>odour</b> in unfresh {{saltwater fish}}.

40|$|<b>Odours</b> {{emitted by}} rodent species convey cues about their overall body {{conditions}} and provide valuable information intervening in {{many aspects of}} their social relationships such as territorial and mating activities. Although bank vole {{is one of the}} primary models for studying chemical communication in wild rodents, literature is scarce about its reactivity to <b>odours</b> of conspecifics from its population compared to those of conspecifics from a different population. Here we tested the effect of the population of origin on the behaviour of wild bank voles (Myodes glareolus) through 30 min tests in laboratory. We observed both males and females differential marking (i. e. by urine or glandular secretions), motor activity and investigation (i. e. sniffing events) in presence of conspecific whole body <b>odours</b> coming from either the Same Population of Origin (SPO) or from a Different Population of Origin (DPO). Our results showed that both male and female bank voles react differently to <b>odours</b> of conspecifics according to the population of origin of the latter. Both motor activity and marking were more important when voles were confronted to <b>odours</b> from DPO donors than SPO ones. These effects were independent of the sex of the subjects. Moreover, male subjects tended to investigate more <b>odours</b> from DPO conspecifics than <b>odours</b> from SPO ones. Causes underlying apparent between-populations differences in the bank voles' body <b>odours</b> are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Honeybees {{extend their}} {{proboscis}} when learning about novel <b>odours.</b> In one study on this response, bees learnt {{to discriminate between}} two <b>odours,</b> but then learned to suppress the proboscis extension response {{when one of the}} <b>odours</b> was paired with an electric shock. This indicates the sensation was aversive to the bee, however, the response was plastic rather than simply reflexive, indicating pain rather than nociception.|$|R
5|$|Olfactory {{navigation}} {{has been}} suggested as a possible mechanism in pigeons. Papi's 'mosaic' model argues that pigeons build and remember a mental map of the odours in their area, recognizing where they are by the local <b>odour.</b> Wallraff's 'gradient' model argues {{that there is a}} steady, large-scale gradient of <b>odour</b> which remains stable for long periods. If there were two or more such gradients in different directions, pigeons could locate themselves in two dimensions by the intensities of the odours. However {{it is not clear that}} such stable gradients exist. Papi did find evidence that anosmic pigeons (unable to detect odours) were much less able to orient and navigate than normal pigeons, so olfaction does seem to be important in pigeon navigation. However, it is not clear how olfactory cues are used.|$|E
5|$|Onion powder is a {{seasoning}} {{widely used}} when the fresh ingredient is not available.

40|$|We deposit dense, ordered, {{thin films}} of Au-dodecanethiol core/shell {{nanoparticles}} by the Langmuir-Schafer (LS) printing method, {{and find that}} their resistance at ambient temperature responds selectively and sensitively to alkane <b>odours.</b> Response is a rapid resistance increase due to swelling, and is strongest for alkane <b>odours</b> where the alkane chain is similar in length to the dodecane shell. For decane <b>odours,</b> we find a response to concentrations as low as 15 ppm, about 600 times below the lower explosive limit. Response is weaker, but still significant, to aromatic <b>odours</b> (e. g. Toluene, Xylene), while potential interferants such as polar and/or hydrogen-bonding <b>odours</b> (e. g. alcohols, ketones, water vapour) are somewhat rejected. Resistance is weakly dependent on temperature, and recovers rapidly and completely to its original value within the error margin of measurement. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|We examine item-specific {{olfactory}} proactive interference (PI) {{effects and}} undertake comparisons with verbal and non-verbal visual stimuli.

These findings occur despite above chance performance and similar serial position functions across both tasks. Experiments 3 and 4 apply words and faces, respectively, to our modified procedure, and show that methodological differences cannot explain the null finding in Experiment 1.  The extent to which <b>odours</b> exhibit analogous PI effects {{to that of other}} modalities is, we argue, contingent on the characteristics of the <b>odours</b> employed...|$|R
5|$|Beetle {{antennae}} {{are primarily}} organs of sensory perception and can detect motion, <b>odour</b> and chemical substances, {{but may also}} be used to physically feel a beetle's environment.

Carrots thrive in the presence of caraway, coriander, chamomile, marigold and Swan River daisy. They can also be good companions for other plants; if left to flower, the carrot, like any umbellifer, attracts predatory wasps that kill many garden pests.|$|E
5|$|Confusion {{with the}} highly {{regarded}} miller or sweetbread mushroom (Clitopilus prunulus) {{is a common}} cause of poisoning in France; the latter fungus has a greyish-white downy cap and whitish decurrent gills which turn pink with maturity. Young fruit bodies of Entoloma sinuatum can also be confused with St George's mushroom (Calocybe gambosa), although the gills of the latter are crowded and cream in colour, and the clouded agaric (Clitocybe nebularis), which has whitish decurrent gills and an unusual <b>odour.</b> To complicate matters, it often grows near these edible species. Its overall size and shape resemble members of the genus Tricholoma, although the spore colour (white in Tricholoma, pinkish in Entoloma) and shape (angular in Entoloma) help distinguish it. The rare and edible all-white dovelike tricholoma (T.columbetta) has a satiny cap and stem and a faint, not mealy, <b>odour.</b> E.sinuatum may be confused with Clitocybe multiceps in the Pacific Northwest of North America, although the latter has white spores and generally grows in clumps. A casual observer may mistake it for an edible field mushroom (Agaricus campestris), but this species has a ring on the stipe, pink gills that become chocolate-brown in maturity, and a dark brown spore print. The poorly known North American species E. albidum resembles E.sinuatum but is likewise poisonous.|$|E
50|$|<b>Odours</b> from {{adult males}} or from {{pregnant}} or lactating females can speed up or retard sexual maturation in juvenile females and synchronise reproductive cycles in mature females (i.e. the Whitten effect). <b>Odours</b> of unfamiliar male mice may terminate pregnancies, i.e. the Bruce effect.|$|R
40|$|Background: Olfaction is {{a highly}} salient sensory {{modality}} in early human life. Neonates show keen olfactory sensitivity and hedonic responsiveness. However, {{little is known about}} hedonic olfactory responsiveness between the neonatal period and 2 years of age. In an attempt to fill this gap, this longitudinal follow-up study aimed at investigating hedonic responses to food <b>odours</b> in infants during the first 2 years of life. The second objective was to evaluate whether gender has an influence on hedonic responses during this early period. Four control stimuli and eight <b>odours</b> (four rated by adults as a priori pleasant and four a priori unpleasant) were presented in bottles to 235 infants at 8, 12 and 22 months of age. The infant’s exploratory behaviour towards odorized and control bottles was measured in terms of mouthing defined as direct contact with perioral and/or perinasal areas. For each odorized bottle, duration proportions of mouthing were calculated relative to the control bottles. Results: For the three ages, shorter duration of mouthing was found for unpleasantly scented bottles compared to pleasantly scented bottles. This contrast between pleasant and unpleasant <b>odours</b> was similar for girls and boys. Correlations of responses between ages were modest in number and level, and concerned mostly unpleasant <b>odours.</b> Conclusion: During {{the first two years of}} life, infants discriminate the hedonic valence of <b>odours.</b> They avoid most of the food <b>odours</b> considered as unpleasant by adults, but their attraction towards food-odours judged pleasant by adults does not appear to be fully shaped at this early age. Taken as a whole, the present results highlight both the plasticity of hedonic responses to food <b>odours,</b> and relatively stable avoidance behaviours towards some unpleasant <b>odours...</b>|$|R

5|$|Despite their {{apparent}} simplicity, {{bacteria can}} form complex associations with other organisms.

5|$|Durian {{flowers are}} large and {{feathery}} with copious nectar, and give off a heavy, sour, and buttery <b>odour.</b> These features are typical of flowers pollinated by certain species of bats that eat nectar and pollen. According to research conducted in Malaysia in the 1970s, durians were pollinated almost exclusively by cave fruit bats (Eonycteris spelaea); however, a 1996 study indicated two species, D. grandiflorus and D. oblongus, were pollinated by spiderhunters (Nectariniidae) and another species, D. kutejensis, was pollinated by giant honey bees and birds as well as bats.|$|E

40|$|When in {{breeding}} condition, {{male and}} female mammals seek out and mate with opposite-sex conspecifics. The neural mechanisms controlling mate recognition and heterosexual partner preference are sexually differentiated by the perinatal actions of sex steroid hormones. Many mammalian species use <b>odours</b> to identify potential mates. Thus, sex differences in partner preference may actually reflect sex differences in how {{male and female}} mammals perceive socially relevant <b>odours.</b> Two olfactory systems have evolved in vertebrates that differ considerably in their anatomy and function. It is generally believed that the main olfactory system is used to detect {{a wide variety of}} volatile <b>odours</b> derived from food prey among many sources, whereas the accessory olfactory system has evolved to detect and process primarily nonvolatile <b>odours</b> shown to influence reproductive behaviours and neuroendocrine functions. Some recent results obtained in oestradiol-deficient aromatase knockout (ArKO) mice that provide evidence for a developmental role of oestradiol in olfactory investigation of volatile body <b>odours</b> are discussed, suggesting that: (i) oestrogens {{contribute to the development of}} the main olfactory system and (ii) mate recognition is mediated by the main as opposed to the accessory olfactory system. Thus, sex differences in mate recognition and sexual partner preference may reflect sex differences in the perception of <b>odours</b> by the main olfactory system. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Parasitoids {{foraging}} {{for larvae}} of Drosophila flies can use <b>odours</b> of adults of their hosts {{as well as}} <b>odours</b> of the food of their host larvae. Adult Drosophila deposit volatile aggregation pheromones into a substrate when mating and ovipositing. In this paper three species of parasitoids with different degrees of host specialization are compared in bioassays with regard to innate responses to aggregation pheromones of adult drosophilid hosts. Specialist parasitoids are assumed to use more specific information about their hosts than generalist parasitoids. Two phylogenetically related eucoilid parasitoids, Leptopilina boulardi a host specialist, and L. heterotoma a generalist, were attracted to <b>odours</b> of adult hosts in windtunnel tests. L. heterotoma responded to <b>odours</b> of all species within its host range and one non-host. The specialist L. boulardi was attracted to <b>odours</b> of adult hosts within its range but also to some non-host species. Production of similar pheromonal compounds by non-host and host Drosophila species can explain the reponses by L. heterotoma and L. boulardi to non-host species.

However, when A. tabida females were given an oviposition experience in the presence of host pheromones, they became attracted to aggregation pheromones of their host. ...|$|R
40|$|The sensory {{basis of}} the navigational map {{remains one of the}} most {{important}} and intriguing questions in animal behaviour. In birds, <b>odours</b> have been hypothesized to provide the primary source of map information. Convincing tests have shown that experienced homing pigeons rely on map information obtained at sites where they are exposed to natural <b>odours,</b> even if subsequently released (without additional olfactory information) at a different site. These findings have been interpreted as support for the olfactory map hypothesis. Using this ‘false-release-site’ (FRS) approach, we compared the effects of exposure to natural <b>odours</b> with that of exposure to a series of artificial <b>odours</b> lacking spatial information. Our findings show that olfactory exposure to either natural or artificial <b>odours</b> at an FRS caused pigeons to rely on map information obtained at the FRS, even if subsequently released at the true-release site in the opposite direction from the home loft. Because artificial <b>odours</b> did not provide map information, however, the findings clearly demonstrate that olfactory exposure provides no navigational information to pigeons whatsoever; instead it activates an independent non-olfactory map system. This test decisively contradicts the olfactory map hypothesis, which predicts that olfactory cues are the primary source of navigational information used by birds...|$|R
