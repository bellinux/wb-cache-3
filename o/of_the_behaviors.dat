5|$|Although its {{equations}} {{of motion}} can be linearized, a bike is a nonlinear system. The variable(s) to be solved for cannot be written as a linear sum of independent components, i.e. its behavior is not expressible as a sum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>behaviors</b> of its descriptors. Generally, nonlinear systems are difficult to solve and are much less understandable than linear systems. In the idealized case, in which friction and any flexing is ignored, a bike is a conservative system. Damping, however, can still be demonstrated: under the right circumstances, side-to-side oscillations will decrease with time. Energy added with a sideways jolt to a bike running straight and upright (demonstrating self-stability) is converted into increased forward speed, not lost, as the oscillations die out.|$|E

Patek et al. observed that before an “escape jump,” the ant will orient its antennae and head perpendicularly to the intruder. Additionally it will sway its entire body and then lift one leg vertically. This is quite an elaborate routine to prepare to propel itself 7cm off of the ground. The reason behind this maneuver {{is to be able}} to grab onto vegetation usually located around their nests in order to provide a form of escape.|$|E

25|$|School {{psychology}} {{dates back}} to the beginning of American psychology in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The field is tied to both functional and clinical psychology. School psychology actually came out of functional psychology. School psychologists were interested in childhood behaviors, learning processes, and dysfunction with life or in the brain itself. They wanted to understand the causes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>behaviors</b> and their effects on learning. In addition to its origins in functional psychology, school psychology is also the earliest example of clinical psychology, beginning around 1890. While both clinical and school psychologists wanted to help improve the lives of children, they approached it in different ways. School psychologists were concerned with school learning and childhood behavioral problems, which largely contrasts the mental health focus of clinical psychologists.|$|E
25|$|Sleep hygiene is {{a common}} term for all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>behaviors</b> which relate to the {{promotion}} of good sleep. These behaviors are {{used as the basis}} of sleep interventions and are the primary focus of sleep education programs. Behaviors include the use of caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol consumption, maximizing the regularity and efficiency of sleep episodes, minimizing medication usage and daytime napping, the promotion of regular exercise, and the facilitation of a positive sleep environment. Exercise can be helpful when establishing a routine for sleep but should not be done close to the time that you are planning on going to sleep. The creation of a positive sleep environment may also be helpful in reducing the symptoms of insomnia. In order to create a positive sleep environment one should remove objects that can cause worry or distressful thoughts from view.|$|E
25|$|Little {{is known}} about the mating habits and {{reproductive}} timing of the banded tunnelweb spider, as it has proven difficult to observe them mating inside their silk tunnel constructs. It is assumed that mating takes place inside the burrow of the female spider, although there are no reported sightings of the actual mating taking place. The actual mating of the spiders is assumed to happen in the same fashion as it does with other closely related mygalomorphs. There has been one recorded sighting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>behaviors</b> leading up to mating, although the actual mating was unsuccessful; it was observed that as the male approached the female’s burrow he outstretched his front pair of legs, exposing his reproductive organs, then whilst vibrating his outstretched legs he moved toward the female. In this instance the female was unresponsive to the male’s advances, and nothing eventuated from the encounter. When a female is impregnated she lays her eggs in early to mid summer, wrapping them in a loose silk egg sack that is stored near the entrance of her burrow. In approximately thirty days the spiderlings hatch and stay nearby in the mother's web before leaving to construct their own silky tunnel web close by. There is a lack of information on the actual lifespan of the spiders, although the lifespan of the males and females differ greatly. Once leaving their mother the males only have a matter of months to find a mate before they die, but females have been known to live up to six years in captivity, being able to moult their skin and reproduce multiple times.|$|E

500|$|Kenji Doya {{has argued}} that the cerebellum's {{function}} is best understood not in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>behaviors</b> it affects, but the neural computations it performs; the cerebellum consists {{of a large number of}} more or less independent modules, all with the same geometrically regular internal structure, and therefore all, it is presumed, performing the same computation. If the input and output connections of a module are with motor areas (as many are), then the module will be involved in motor behavior; but, if the connections are with areas involved in non-motor cognition, the module will show other types of behavioral correlates. Thus the cerebellum has been implicated in the regulation of many differing functional traits such as affection. emotion and behavior. The cerebellum, Doya proposes, is best understood as predictive action selection based on [...] "internal models" [...] of the environment or a device for supervised learning, in contrast to the basal ganglia, which perform reinforcement learning, and the cerebral cortex, which performs unsupervised learning.|$|E

2500|$|Historically, {{for many}} years the {{predominant}} view of {{the function of the}} nervous system was as a stimulus-response associator. [...] In this conception, neural processing begins with stimuli that activate sensory neurons, producing signals that propagate through chains of connections in the spinal cord and brain, giving rise eventually to activation of motor neurons and thereby to muscle contraction, i.e., to overt responses. [...] Descartes believed that all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>behaviors</b> of animals, and most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>behaviors</b> of humans, could be explained in terms of stimulus-response circuits, although he also believed that higher cognitive functions such as language were not capable of being explained mechanistically. [...] Charles Sherrington, in his influential 1906 book The Integrative Action of the Nervous System, developed the concept of stimulus-response mechanisms in much more detail, and Behaviorism, the school of thought that dominated Psychology through the middle of the 20th century, attempted to explain every aspect of human behavior in stimulus-response terms.|$|E

2500|$|Dr. Nicholas Dodman {{describes}} {{a wide variety}} of OCD-like behaviors in his book Dogs Behaving Badly. [...] Such behaviors typically appear when the dog is placed in a stressful situation, including an environment that is not very stimulating or a history of abuse. [...] Different breeds of dog seem to display different compulsions. [...] Lick granuloma, or licking repeatedly until ulcers form on the skin, affects more large dogs, like Labradors, golden retrievers, Great Danes, and Dobermans, while bull terriers, German shepherds, Old English sheepdogs, Rottweilers, wire-haired fox terriers, and springer spaniels are more likely to snap at imaginary flies or chase light and shadows. [...] These associations probably have an evolutionary basis, although Dodman does not clearly explain that aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>behaviors.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Prior and Glaser {{describe}} the lists as [...] "wildly inclusive" [...] and state that many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>behaviors</b> in the lists {{are likely to}} be the consequences of neglect and abuse rather than located within the attachment paradigm. Descriptions of children are frequently highly pejorative and [...] "demonizing". Examples given from lists of attachment disorder symptoms found on the internet include lying, avoiding eye contact except when lying, persistent nonsense questions or incessant chatter, fascination with fire, blood, gore and evil, food related issues (such as gorging or hoarding), cruelty to animals and lack of conscience. They also give an example from the Evergreen Consultants in Human Behavior which offers a 45-symptom checklist including bossiness, stealing, enuresis and language disorders.|$|E
2500|$|In {{syntactic}} analysis, {{a constituent}} {{is a word}} {{or a group of}} words that function(s) as a single unit within a hierarchical structure. [...] The analysis of constituent structure is associated mainly with phrase structure grammars, although dependency grammars also allow sentence structure to be broken down into constituent parts. The constituent structure of sentences is identified using constituency tests. These tests manipulate some portion of a sentence and based on the result, clues are delivered about the immediate constituent structure of the sentence. Many constituents are phrases. A phrase is a sequence of one or more words (in some theories two or more) built around a head lexical item and working as a unit within a sentence.

2500|$|This method uses {{structured}} interviews, checklists, rating scales, or questionnaires {{to obtain}} information from persons {{who are familiar with}} the person exhibiting the behavior to identify possible conditions or events in the natural environment that correlate with the problem behavior. They are referred to as [...] "indirect" [...] because they do not involve direct observation of the behavior, but rather they solicit information based on others' recollections of the behavior. This form of assessment typically yields the least reliable information about the function of behavior, but can provide insight as to possible functions of the behavior to be tested in the future, the form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>behaviors</b> (e.g. screaming, hitting, etc.), and environments in which the behavior typically occurs (e.g. school, home, etc.).

2500|$|Behavioral {{interventions}} {{also have}} a fairly strong evidence base in impulse control disorders. In ADHD, the behavioral interventions of behavioral parent training, behavioral classroom management, and intensive peer-focused behavioral interventions in recreational settings meet stringent guidelines qualifying them for evidence based treatment status. In addition, a recent meta-analysis of evidence-based ADHD treatment found organization training to be a well-established treatment method. Empirically validated behavioral treatments for substance use disorder are fairly similar across substance use disorders, and include behavioral couples therapy, CBT, contingency management, motivational enhancement therapy, and relapse prevention. [...] Pyromania and kleptomania are understudied (due {{in large part to}} the illegality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>behaviors),</b> though there is some evidence that psychotherapeutic interventions (CBT, short term counseling, day treatment programs) are efficacious in treating pyromania, while kleptomania seems to be best impacted using SSRIs.

2500|$|Biologists or {{philosophers}} {{of biology}} use Occam's razor {{in either of}} two contexts both in evolutionary biology: the units of selection controversy and systematics. George C. Williams in his book Adaptation and Natural Selection (1966) argues {{that the best way}} to explain altruism among animals is based on low-level (i.e., individual) selection as opposed to high-level group selection. Altruism is defined by some evolutionary biologists (e.g., R. Alexander, 1987; W. D. Hamilton, 1964) as behavior that is beneficial to others (or to the group) at a cost to the individual, and many posit individual selection as the mechanism that explains altruism solely in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>behaviors</b> of individual organisms acting in their own self-interest (or in the interest of their genes, via kin selection). Williams was arguing against the perspective of others who propose selection at the level of the group as an evolutionary mechanism that selects for altruistic traits (e.g., D. S. Wilson & E. O. Wilson, 2007). The basis for Williams' contention is that of the two, individual selection is the more parsimonious theory. In doing so he is invoking a variant of Occam's razor known as Morgan's Canon: [...] "In no case is an animal activity to be interpreted in terms of higher psychological processes, if it can be fairly interpreted in terms of processes which stand lower in the scale of psychological evolution and development." [...] (Morgan 1903).|$|E
