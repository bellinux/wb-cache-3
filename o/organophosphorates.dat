40|$|For {{the control}} of the Culicidae there are several methods of {{chemical}} and biological control that can be applied with relative success for a rapid decrease in this insect family, which is linked to public health matters. Among them, the ones that provide higher effectivity and reasonable safety for the relationship environment-mankind have the recommendation of the World Health Organization (WHO) for the application in control activities. Then, the most frequently applied methods in the struggle against vectors are the biological insecticides, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bti) and Bacillus sphaericus (Bs), together with chemicals, such as the <b>organophosphorates</b> and pyrethroids (Forattini 2002). However, these approaches confront a great deal of problems that endanger these pests’ control, particularly the short effectivity period, the mosquitoes ’ resistance to the insecticides ’ active principles, the environments contamination (Stenersen 2004, WHO 1992) and also for not being self-sustainable strategies. In the last decades, in search for new methodologies that supply the deficiency of the traditional methods, emphasis has been given to methods supported by the theoretical foundations of chemical ecology, especially concerning the semiochemicals. ‘Semiochemical ’ include infochemicals, toxins and nutrients (Dicke & Sabelis 1988). Infochemicals are Review of semiochemicals that mediate the oviposition of mosquitoes: a possible sustainable tool for the control and monitoring of Culicida...|$|E
40|$|Raptorial birds harbor {{a variety}} of ectoparasites and the mayority of them are host specific. The {{aim of this study}} was to {{identify}} the ectoparasites of captive birds of prey from Mexico, as well as to verify their impact in the health of infested birds. Raptorial birds were confiscated and kept in captivity at the Centro de Investigación y Conservación de Vida Silvestre (CIVS) in Los Reyes La Paz, Mexico State. Seventy-four birds of prey (66 Falconiformes and eigth Strigiformes) of 15 species were examined for the presence of ectoparasites. We examined both juvenile and adult birds from both sexes. The overall prevalence was 16. 2 %; 66. 7 % of raptors were infested with a single type of external parasite. Lice were the most prevalent ectoparasites (91. 7 %), followed by feather mites and fleas (8. 3 %). Degeeriella fulva (72. 7 %), Craspedorrhynchus sp. (45. 4 %) and Strigiphilus aitkeni (9. 1 %) (Ischnocera, Philopteridae) were recovered from wings, head and neck regions of red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), Swainson’s hawk (B. swainsoni), Harris’s hawk (Parabuteo unicinctus) and Barn owl (Tyto alba). Low lice infestation level was observed. Nymphs and females of feather mites Kramerella sp. (Pterolichoidea, Kramerellidae) were recovered solely from Barn owl (T. alba); while one Caracara (Caracara cheriway) was infested by the sticktight flea Echidnophaga gallinacea (Siphonaptera, Pulicidae). No clinical signs were observed in any infested bird. Probably the periodic use of <b>organophosphorates</b> was responsible of the low prevalence and lice infestation levels. The diversity of external parasites illustrates the importance of detailed revision of incoming and long-term captive raptors as part of responsible captive management. Five new hosts and geographic records are presented. Rev. Biol. Trop. 59 (3) : 1257 - 1264. Epub 2011 September 01...|$|E
40|$|Parathion((R)) is an <b>organophosphorate</b> {{pesticide}} amply used in agriculture. Many alterations {{induced by}} <b>organophosphorate</b> pesticides have been described, such as: cytogenetic alterations in germinal cells, oligozoospermia and teratozoospermia in the mouse. The effect of Parathion((R)), both pure (PP) and commercial (PC), on mouse interstitial cell testosterone production was evaluated in vivo and in vitro. Male mice were intraperitoneally injected {{with a single}} dose of 1 / 3 LD 50 of Parathion((R)), both PP and PC. The animals were sacrificed at 1, 8 and 40 days post injection to evaluate the impact of disrupting testosterone production on spermatogonia, spermatocytes and elongated spermatids. The plasma testosterone was assayed by standard radioimmunoanalysis. The same method was used to assay testosterone in the culture medium of interstitial cells obtained from the control and Parathion((R)) treated animals {{at the same time}} intervals. Sperm count, sperm teratozoospermia and tubular blockage were analyzed for an appraisal of spermatogenesis. Increase in the teratozoospermia and tubular blockage was detected in the PP and PC group at 8 and 40 days post injection. Plasma testosterone levels drop significantly at 8 days and recovered slowly at 40 days only in PP animals as detected in vivo, implying interference of testicular steroidogenesis due to the toxicant. Recuperation of normality occurs at long time intervals. In conclusion, Parathion((R)) disturbs the synthesis of testosterone in mice affecting qualitatively the spermatogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Considering {{acute and}} chronic {{toxicity}} effects on {{human and animal}} health caused by pesticide residues in food, this study aimed to analyze <b>organophosphorate</b> (OP) and carbamate (CB) in feedstuff and water destined for dairy cattle, {{as well as in}} the milk produced by these animals, through gas chromatography (GC). In the Agreste region of Pernambuco, Brazil, 30 raw milk samples and all components of the animals' diet were collected from several farms. Out of the 30 milk of milk analyzed, six (20 %) were contaminated with OP, five (16. 7 %) with CB, and one sample with both pesticides. From 48 analyzed feed samples, 15 (31. 25 %) were contaminated with residues of OP, six (12. 50 %) with CB, and one sample was contaminated with both pesticides. Out of 16 water samples analyzed, six (37. 50 %) were contaminated with OP residues, but non with CB. In four dairy farms the pesticides detected in milk were compatible with the active principles found in water and/or foodstuff, suggesting them to be the source of contamination...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Diazinon (DZN) is an <b>organophosphorate</b> {{synthetic}} insecticide widely usedin agriculture. DZN {{has been observed}} to cause many changes, such as alterations inandrogenic hormones. In the present study, the effect of DZN treatment on the structureof the testes and spermatogenesis in young adult Albino rats was evaluated. Materials and Methods: Adult rats were randomly divided into three groups including:controls (n= 6), DZN-treatment group A (n= 6) and DZN-treatment group B (n= 6). CommercialDZN was injected intraperitoneally in a single dose (A= 25 mg/kg and B= 2. 5 mg/kg), corresponding to LD 50. Thirty five days after injection, animals were sacrificed formorphological and histological examinations. Results: There was {{a significant reduction in}} seminiferous tubule size in group A incomparison with both controls and group B (p< 0. 001). The number of spermatocytes,Leydig and germinal cells were significantly decreased (p< 0. 001). These differenceswere not significant between the controls and group B; however, the number of spermatocytesin group B was significantly lower than in the controls (p< 0. 01). Conclusion: This study revealed that the reproductive function of adult rats and spermatogenesisare sensitive to DZN treatment. In addition, the effect of DZN on morphologicalparameters was significantly dose dependent. Further study of the control DZNand the actual mechanism whereby it exerts toxic effects on male infertility is required...|$|R
