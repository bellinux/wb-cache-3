5|$|Scholars {{agree that}} there are no {{completely}} reliable methods <b>of</b> <b>determining</b> the exact chronology of musical instruments across cultures. Comparing and organizing instruments based on their complexity is misleading, since advancements in musical instruments have sometimes reduced complexity.

5|$|The {{only major}} {{measurement}} {{that could not}} be made automatically or before the mission was the determination of the windspeed and direction. These change over time, and also due to changes in location, altitude, or wind shear. This demanded an accurate determination of the wind in the general area of the target, and would normally be highly inaccurate if dialled in at the mission start. Taking this measurement while nearing the target was an important procedure on the CSBS; its manual included several methods <b>of</b> <b>determining</b> the wind. In the case of the Mk. XIV, the manual described only one method <b>of</b> <b>determining</b> the wind, equivalent to the most complex of the procedures from the CSBS model.|$|E

40|$|The {{urgency of}} the {{analyzed}} problem {{is due to the}} fact that the need to study the relationship of economic phenomena and the comparative analysis of the factor ratings not only in time but also in space requires the development <b>of</b> <b>determined</b> factor analysis. The purpose of the article is to develop a generalized method <b>of</b> <b>determined</b> factor analysis, which increases the accuracy of its results, and it will broaden and deepen its scope. The leading approach to solve the problems <b>of</b> <b>determined</b> factor analysis is a systematic approach that allows establishing a more precise assessment of multiplicative component. Results: The proposed generalized integral method <b>of</b> <b>determined</b> factor analysis has a high precision of factorial assessment, and the ground construction allows carrying out a comparative analysis of the impact of factors on a productive indicator of the surveyed economic system of any level. The data of this article may be useful for the analysis of economic activity of organizations, as well as for the development of the economic development strategy. © 2016 Chistik et al...|$|R

5|$|A {{convenient}} means <b>of</b> <b>determining</b> {{the order}} of a given sigmatropic rearrangement is to number the atoms of the bond being broken as atom 1, and then count the atoms in each direction from the broken bond to the atoms that form the new σ-bond in the product, numbering consecutively.

However, Fisher argued that according to the Convention Rules, blank votes are not counted for the purposes <b>of</b> <b>determining</b> the winner and that he thus received 15.148%, enough to make the ballot. He sued the Massachusetts Republican State Committee and was certified for the primary ballot after a lengthy battle. In the primary election held on September 9, Baker defeated Fisher with 74% of the vote.|$|E

A large variety of record types exist and men's and women's {{performances are}} recorded separately. The foremost types of records organise athlete's performances by the region they represent—beginning with national records, then continental records, up to the global or world record level. National governing bodies control the national record lists, the area associations organise their respective continental lists, and the IAAF ratifies world records.|$|E

The player then chooses a race (species) such as human or elf, a character class (occupation) such as fighter or wizard, an alignment (a moral and ethical outlook), and other features to round out the character's abilities and backstory, which have varied in nature through differing editions.|$|E

5|$|Galileo {{was able}} to develop a method <b>of</b> <b>determining</b> {{longitude}} based on {{the timing of the}} orbits of the Galilean moons. The times of the eclipses of the moons could be precisely calculated in advance, and compared with local observations on land or on ship to determine the local time and hence longitude. The main problem with the technique was that it was difficult to observe the Galilean moons through a telescope on a moving ship; a problem that Galileo tried to solve with the invention of the celatone. The method was used by Cassini and Picard to re-map France.|$|E

Committees of political leaders and intellectuals were established by state legislatures to research and propose a seal and coat of arms. Many of these members were signers of the Articles of Confederation, Declaration of Independence, and United States Constitution. Several of the earliest adopted state coats of arms and seals were similar or identical to their colonial counterparts.|$|E
