40|$|The present {{research}} established three objectives in examining helping behavior in organizations. First, a need was identified {{to focus on}} a broader range <b>of</b> <b>helping</b> behaviors than previous organizational research has typically focused on. Second, a need was identified to examine a comprehensive model <b>of</b> <b>helping</b> behavior in organizations which included antecedents from across several <b>of</b> the <b>helping</b> literatures. Finally, a need to examine a cross-level model <b>of</b> <b>helping</b> behavior in organizations, including both individual-level and group-level antecedents, was identified. Two hypothesized models were developed, one including the antecedents <b>of</b> <b>helping</b> behavior directed toward coworkers and one including the antecedents <b>of</b> <b>helping</b> behavior directed toward the supervisor. ^ A measure capturing a broad conceptualization <b>of</b> <b>helping</b> behavior in organizations was developed and the models were tested using management teams in a freight delivery firm. The cross-level models were analyzed using Hierarchical Linear Modeling. The results from the model <b>of</b> <b>helping</b> behavior directed toward coworkers supported the effects of the group, with both group size and proximity to coworkers being significantly related to helping behavior. No individual-level antecedents were found to have significant effects on helping behavior directed toward coworkers. The results from the model <b>of</b> <b>helping</b> behavior directed toward the supervisor supported the role of both the individual and the group. Specifically, the supervisor played an instrumental role both through the quality of the exchange relationship, an individual-level process, and through the leader 2 ̆ 7 s positive mood, a group-level or contextual effect. Implications for the study <b>of</b> <b>helping</b> behavior are discussed including the need {{to focus on a}} broader range <b>of</b> <b>helping</b> behaviors and the need to consider the helping process and its antecedents from a multiple-level perspective. ...|$|R

40|$|Employees help on {{a regular}} daily basis while at work, yet {{surprisingly}} {{little is known about}} how responding to help requests affects helpers. Although recent theory suggests that helping may come at a cost to the helper, the majority <b>of</b> the <b>helping</b> literature has focused on the benefits <b>of</b> <b>helping.</b> The current study addresses the complex nature <b>of</b> <b>helping</b> by simultaneously considering its costs and benefits for helpers. Using daily diary data across 3 consecutive work weeks, we examine the relationship between responding to help requests, perceived prosocial impact <b>of</b> <b>helping,</b> and helpers’ regulatory resources. We find that responding to help requests depletes regulatory resources at an increasing rate, yet perceived prosocial impact <b>of</b> <b>helping</b> can replenish resources. We also find that employees’ prosocial motivation moderates these within-person relationships, such that prosocial employees are depleted to a larger extent by responding to help requests, and replenished to a lesser extent by the perceived prosocial impact <b>of</b> <b>helping.</b> Understanding the complex relationship <b>of</b> <b>helping</b> with regulatory resources is important because such resources have downstream effects on helpers’ behavior in the workplace.

50|$|The nature <b>of</b> <b>helping</b> {{has been}} debated {{for a long}} time.

40|$|Why {{do people}} help others and what motivates them {{to engage in}} {{voluntary}} work? Are the psychological mechanisms that initiate prosocial behavior similar across cultures? In order to find answers for these questions, we give {{an overview of the}} prominent approaches to helping, and report findings of studies investigating informal spontaneous help and formal, planned forms <b>of</b> <b>helping.</b> A linchpin <b>of</b> our review is to go beyond a mere descriptive comparison <b>of</b> <b>helping</b> and volunteering across cultures, and to examine the pathways leading to helping and volunteering, which we argue can be considered universal across cultural contexts. Previous studies demonstrate cultural differences in the frequencies <b>of</b> <b>helping</b> and volunteering. Particularly when the prosocial act is not directed at close others, i. e., at out-group members, differences between cultural samples are likely to emerge.

40|$|Third party-hosted {{consumer}} {{communities in}} general, and brand communities in particular, have been touted {{for their ability}} to generate value for firms by promoting consumer-to-consumer (C 2 C) helping. However, little research has examined whether consumer communities actually foster C 2 C helping, and who is helped. In contrast, the brand-community literature suggests community strategies may reduce the likelihood <b>of</b> community members <b>helping</b> non-community members. If so, strategies that promote third party-hosted brand or product-category communities may be counterproductive in fostering C 2 C helping. Should firms focus on promoting brand communities, promoting product-category communities, or both? On the basis of a hazard model analysis of 9, 192 actual C 2 C helping events over a 25 -month period, and supported by a second cross-sectional study, this article examines how participation in brand and product-category communities influences one's likelihood <b>of</b> <b>helping</b> others.

40|$|A {{promising}} line {{of inquiry}} in sexual violence prevention involves training potential bystanders to intervene in situations where there is risk for violence. Theories of bystander intervention often discuss barriers to helping behavior, {{but there has been}} little empirical inquiry into this question. We will present findings of a study of both barriers and facilitators <b>of</b> <b>helping</b> behavior in the context of sexual violence among first-semester college students. Two hundred and forty-two first year college students completed surveys during their first year of college. Measures included assessment of bystander behavior, perceived barriers to helping, as well as a variety of other variables identified in the literature as key correlates <b>of</b> <b>helping.</b> Quantitative and qualitative analyses were used to (a) describe barriers and facilitators <b>of</b> <b>helping,</b> (b) examine the relationship between barriers and self-reports <b>of</b> <b>helping,</b> and (c) model individual differences in helping behavior. In quantitative analyses, barriers, as assessed in this study, were better predictors <b>of</b> <b>helping</b> behavior directed at strangers than <b>helping</b> <b>of</b> friends. Results suggested that open-ended responses about the facilitators and barriers to helping for sexual violence map well onto social-psychological models of bystander behavior, and that greater prosocial tendencies, an intrapersonal variable, increase actual helping behavior. A more specific understanding of what promotes and hinders helping can be used to enhance prevention education efforts focused on increasing helpful bystander actions...|$|R
