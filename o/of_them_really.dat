25|$|Late 1791, a {{group of}} Assembly members who {{propagated}} war against Austria and Prussia was, after some remark of politician Maximilien Robespierre, henceforth indicated as the 'Girondins', although not all <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>really</b> came from the southern province of Gironde. A group around Robespierre – later indicated as 'Montagnards' or 'Jacobins' – pleaded against that war; this opposition between those groups would harden and embitter in the next 1½ years.|$|E
500|$|According to Wisden in 1901, as a batsman Ollivierre [...] "was {{particularly}} strong in cutting and playing to leg". J. N. Pentelow, a cricket writer, suggested in 1928 that [...] "there {{was something about}} Ollivierre that reminded {{one of the great}} Ranji. He was a more heavily built man than the slim Ranji of the days when we were young; but his strokes and his movements had real grace." [...] A correspondent in the Observer in 1931 remembered Ollivierre as a [...] "great batsman", while Neville Cardus, writing in 1920, named Ollivierre among a list of top-quality batsmen who did not do themselves justice at the highest level: [...] "Geniuses who have just lost their way...every one of them in possession of an excellent enough record in county cricket, but every one <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>really</b> intended by nature to wear the most precious laurels the greatest of games has to offer".|$|E
500|$|Control {{and camera}} {{movement}} concerned reviewers. Bettenhausen called the controls [...] "a tad reckless at first – Sonic's momentum takes {{some getting used}} to, and trying to go in reverse is a pain – but become more natural and fluid as you get acclimated to the fast-paced, twitchy action." [...] Casamassina and Mueller offered similar opinions, while Shepperd criticized the game's low camera angle and arbitrary targeting system. Bettenhausen dismissed the game's multiplayer mode as a failed adaptation of the Mario Party series. Fahey concurred, adding that a multiplayer racing mode would have been preferable to [...] "lame" [...] minigames. Casamassina compared the games to those in : [...] "only a handful <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>really</b> stand out and some are downright pointless, but overall gamers will probably be happy that they were included." [...] Shepperd agreed, but decried the necessity to [...] "play the story mode extensively to unlock some of the party mode's best features." ...|$|E

Besides, I really don't think he'd come; he's so taken up with those horrid horses, and that Mr Blake, who is worse than any <b>of</b> <b>'em.</b> <b>Really,</b> Fanny, Kilcullen says that he and Mr Blake are quite notorious." ...|$|R

500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mostly mixed, calling the storyline [...] "a {{loudspeaker}} for political views." [...] Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club wrote {{of the episode}}, [...] "I {{had a hard time}} listening to the characters spout out opinions, since none <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>really</b> made sense as character views and felt distinctly like the writers just wanted a place to dump their liberalisms – I don't want to only call out Seth MacFarlane because he didn't write this episode, but considering the little bit I know about the show's writer's room, it's pretty safe to assume he has final say on this sort of thing, especially given his 9/11 experience." [...] He also compared the A-story to the television series South Park, noting, [...] "It's very clear that South Park benefits from the short turnaround time between production and air, because it allows that show to comment very quickly on current events, and stay timely. Family Guy seems to do the exact opposite, waiting an extraordinarily long time to weigh in on a serious issue it doesn’t satirize for comedy." [...] He ended his review by commenting, [...] "After last week's bright spot, I knew we were headed back down for another helping of the usual misery, but this week offered neither a surprise nor an all-out failure, just expected, bland mediocrity." [...] He graded the episode as a C. In a much more positive review, Terren R. Moore of Ology, writing, [...] "It's just funny, and it's got a lot of ways of achieving that funniness, and it's definitely true that the show isn't always in its best form, but [...] "Thanksgiving" [...] shows that Family Guy refuses to be dead yet." [...] He also praised the episode for giving each character their own part in the episode, adding, [...] "while most of the story revolves around Joe, Kevin, and Peter, the three kids and Brian also get time in as well." [...] Moore also stated his enjoyment of the cultural references in the episode, stating, [...] "It's all good fun, and the cutaways are also top notch, including Peter's First Holiday and The Cowardly Lion as Lindsay Lohan's gynecologist. I nearly fell out when Peter described his probably-black coworker {{who turned out to be}} a white guy, which I should have seen coming because it's very Family Guy, but still managed to get a laugh out of me." [...] He gave the episode a nine out of ten.|$|E
500|$|Dean-Charles Chapman, who portrayed King Tommen Baratheon, {{spoke about}} filming his death scene, saying [...] "I was jumping onto a crash mat. Height-wise, I think if I was {{standing}} on the floor, it was up to my chest. But the crash mat was pretty thick. I must have done that about 50 times. My face was pretty bruised up. My face took it a little bit." [...] Eugene Simon, who portrayed Lancel Lannister, also spoke about his death scene revealing about his discussions with Sapochnik, [...] "the note was when Lancel was dragging his body, {{there was a sense of}} someone who is trying to put aside their pain of being stabbed and being paralyzed as much as possible in order to try to defend what little hope there is left of trying to save the sept and also to save their life. It really only comes down to the very last few nanoseconds of footage that you realize the cause is lost." [...] Simon also stated about the filming of Jonathan Pryce's, who portrays the High Sparrow, final scene, [...] "we had a very big nice round of applause when that took place. I remember that scene very well; we had 200 or so supporting actors in there, all of whom were so committed. They stayed there all day and did wonderful reactions to all the really intense bits. When the first part of the bomb goes off, all <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>really,</b> really performed that there was a full-on nuclear explosion going on underneath them." [...] He continued, [...] "We had a big round of applause and celebration after that scene was done because I think we all knew it was going to be pretty monumentous. We said goodbye to countless Tyrells, Kevan Lannister my father, the High Sparrow and dozens of other. It was a pretty extraordinary day." [...] In regards to the non-verbal exchange between Jaime and Cersei Lannister when she is sitting on the Iron Throne, Sapochnik stated [...] "I thought that non-verbal exchange was a very interesting moment but it wasn't clear from the script what exactly Benioff and Weiss wanted. So we just tried a few things, following our noses, drawing from what we knew about these characters and what you see was one of the versions we shot. Interestingly in the edit I still couldn't find a version I felt worked so I actually dropped the moment entirely out of my cut but David and Dan reinstated and to great effect. In fact, I can't really remember the sequence without it anymore. I think he's saying 'don't' and she's saying 'too late.'" [...] He continued [...] "The wonderful thing about filmmaking is you make and remake your film or episode a number of times over the duration of its existence. Firstly in the script stage, second is in prep when you plan how you're going to execute it. Third is in production when you actually get there and have to change everything and finally, in the edit, when you realize what you thought something meant means something totally different when put before or after another juxtaposing or complimentary image." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the middle}} of the 19th century, a {{significant}} portion of the Swedish-speaking upper class in Finland decided that Finnish had to be made equal in usage to Swedish. They even started using Finnish as their home language, even while very few <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>really</b> mastered it well. Since the historical [...] no more had a common way of pronunciation between different Finnish dialects and since it was usually written as d, many started using the Swedish pronunciation , which eventually became the educated norm.|$|E
5000|$|According to Jew, [...] "I’ve {{learned that}} people’s self-image comes from that last picture taken <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> It <b>really</b> {{does have an}} {{influence}} on the psyche and translates into self-esteem." ...|$|R

50|$|The two team up {{to escape}} the island since Clara no longer desires {{to be with her}} {{previous}} crew and arrives to a labyrinth cave where her father's ship The Red Herring is hidden but none <b>of</b> <b>them</b> can <b>really</b> find it. But James uses his voodoo book to hear the ghostly voices and uses it to guide themselves to the ship, but none <b>of</b> <b>them</b> can <b>really</b> sail a ship since the ship needs a crew and James is the son of a clown. James uses the Raise the Dead spell and summons the spirit of Captain Silvereye who takes the ship to Shipwreck Island, Clara's family home.|$|R
2500|$|To {{help define}} the film's look the crew watched period {{films such as}} Sleepy Hollow, Amadeus, Oliver Twist, Barry Lyndon, From Hell, The Elephant Man, Dracula, Brotherhood of the Wolf, Vidocq, and Les Misérables. Cinematographer Frank Griebe said {{that of all the}} films they watched that had been shot on location, none <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>really</b> had the dirt and grit of the city that they desired for Perfume. [...] "We needed a filthy city to get the real feel for the smells of it", said Griebe. Tykwer wanted to {{recreate}} 18th-century Paris, as seen {{through the eyes of the}} lower-class Grenouille and said that he wanted to shoot the film [...] "as if we were thrown into a time machine with a camera." ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} of the Smile era, Wilson had indulged himself in works ranging from the I Ching and Subud philosophy, tracts on astrology, {{detailed}} charts of the stars and planets, various topics of mysticism, The Little Prince, the novels of Hermann Hesse, works by Kahlil Gibran, Rod McKuen, and Walter Benton's This is My Beloved. In a reported meeting at Wilson's home between him and novelist Thomas Pynchon—a fan of Pet Sounds—the two were so intimidated by each other that [...] "neither <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>really</b> said a word all night long." [...] Wilson had also developed an obsession with the Del Close and John Brent comedy album How to Speak Hip (1959), and attempted to reference it in Pet Sounds with the provisional song title [...] "And Then We'll Have World Peace".|$|E
2500|$|... "I Should Be So Lucky" [...] is a dance-pop–oriented song which {{features}} elements of bubblegum pop and new wave music. According {{to the music}} sheet on MusicNotes.com, which was published by Universal Music Publishing Group, the song {{is set in the}} key of C major. Minogue's vocals span from D4 to C5. [...] The song is set in common time and moves at a moderate tempo of 116 beats per minute. Instrumentation of the song features synthesizers, keyboards and guitars. According to PopMatters, they said the song features [...] "numerous orchestra hits to the uncomfortably thin sounding drum machine." [...] Waterman has said the tune was inspired by Pachelbel's Canon. Stock told the Guardian: [...] "Anyone who thinks I Should Be So Lucky is easy should try to play it. It's in four keys, all <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>really</b> awkward, and you can't even strum it unless you're a really good musician." ...|$|E

2500|$|Game Informers Matt Helgeson scored it 7.75 out of 10, {{calling it}} [...] "still the same flawed game that was {{released}} for the current-gen systems." [...] Eurogamer's Kristan Reed scored it 6 out of 10, writing [...] "the changes and improvements are so minor {{that you might}} not have noticed them were they not written down for you. Tellingly, none <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>really</b> address the fundamental gripes that dragged the game down in the first place." [...] He was critical of the graphics, arguing [...] "the game looks like a port from the word go. The low-poly character models, stilted animation and bland texture detail of the original is exposed even more once you see it running in high def." [...] He concluded [...] "the core of The Godfather can be quite harmlessly entertaining. Like so many openworld games, there's a moreishness to it that keeps you going even when so many alarm bells are ringing about where EA went wrong. But let's face it, The Godfather should have been far better than it is." ...|$|E
