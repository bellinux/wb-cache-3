Among them, coins {{belonging to the}} chieftains of the Malayaman clan {{have been found in}} Tamil Nadu. Many of them contain a written legend on the <b>obverse</b> and all of them have the image of a flowing river on their <b>obverse.</b> Based on the legends some of these coins have been assigned to specific rulers such as Tirukkannan, also known as Malaiyan Choliya Enadi Tirukkannan, and Tirumudi Kari. A series of coins without a legend but with a horse as the principal motif on the <b>obverse</b> have been assigned to the Malayaman chieftains, because of the river symbol on the <b>obverse.</b> Numismatist R. Krishnamurthy, dates these coins to the period between 100 BCE and 100 CE.|$|E

5|$|The <b>obverse</b> of {{the coin}} {{features}} jugate busts of Bibb, Alabama's first governor as a state, and the incumbent in 1919, Kilby. In so appearing, Kilby became the first living person depicted on a U.S. coin. Anthony Swiatek, in his volume on commemoratives, averred that the issuance was not controversial at the time, as the Act of May 16, 1866, that forbids the depiction of living people on currency was deemed to refer to paper money only, but Q. David Bowers wrote that the portrayal caused contemporary comment, for {{the position of the}} federal government (excepting some paper money issues of the 19th century) was that living people should not appear on U.S. money. A total of 22 stars flank the busts, symbolic of Alabama being the 22nd state; a message reinforced on those pieces bearing the inscription 2X2 in the <b>obverse</b> field. The X in that inscription alludes to the St. Andrew's cross on the flag of Alabama. The date, the names of the governors, and various other wordings appear towards the rim of the <b>obverse.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The <b>obverses</b> {{for both}} {{the first and second}} design are the same. The field has a Jamaican flag. Encircling the inside rim are the words [...] "The National Flag of Jamaica," [...] with a small {{pineapple}} at the bottom separating the wording.|$|R

5|$|All Assay Commission medals are {{extremely}} rare. Except for the 1977 medal, none {{is believed to}} have been issued in a quantity of greater than 200, and in most years fewer than 50 were struck. Additional copies of several 19th-century issues are known to have been illicitly struck; the Mint ended such practices in the early 20th century. The <b>obverse</b> of the 1909 issue, depicting Treasury Secretary George Cortelyou, was reused as Cortelyou's entry in the Mint's series of medals honoring Secretaries of the Treasury. The later pieces were struck with a blank reverse, but in the early 1960s, the reverse design from the Assay Commission issue was used with the Cortelyou <b>obverse,</b> and an unknown number sold to the public. The restrikes are said to be less distinctly struck than the originals.|$|E

50|$|The {{more common}} type on later <b>obverses</b> {{is the head}} of Ceres but in the mid-late 4th century BCE, the head of the hero Leucippus, the reputed founder of the city appears for the first time. This is thought {{to be related to the}} {{expedition}} of Alexander I of Epirus to Southern Italy.|$|R
50|$|Three {{different}} <b>obverses</b> have so {{far been}} used; 1966 to 1984 the head of Queen Elizabeth II by Arnold Machin; between 1985 and 1998 the head by Raphael Maklouf; and since 1999 the head by Ian Rank-Broadley. Inscription of AUSTRALIA on the right hand side and ELIZABETH II on the left hand side.|$|R
5|$|In 1966, a {{small change}} {{was made to}} the design to add the {{initials}} of the designer (FS) to the <b>obverse,</b> underneath Jefferson's portrait. In commemoration of that change, two specimen 1966 nickels with the initials were struck and presented to him. Coins struck at any mint between 1965 and 1967 lack mint marks, which were omitted as the Mint replaced the silver circulating coins with copper-nickel. Beginning in 1968, mint marks were again used, and on the nickel were moved to {{the lower part of}} the <b>obverse,</b> to the right of Jefferson's bust. From 1971, no nickels were struck for circulation in San Francisco—the 1971-S was the first nickel struck in proof only since 1878.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, the Central Bank of Armenia issued 50-dram {{banknotes}} depicting Khachaturian's portrait and the Yerevan Opera Theater on the <b>obverse</b> and {{an episode}} from the ballet Gayane and Mount Ararat on the reverse. It remained in use until 2004 {{when it was}} replaced by a coin. He is the only composer to be depicted on Armenian currency.|$|E
5|$|In January 1938, the Mint {{announced}} an open competition {{for a new}} nickel design, to feature early president Thomas Jefferson on the <b>obverse,</b> and Jefferson's home, Monticello on the reverse. The last Buffalo nickels were struck in April 1938 at the Denver Mint, the only mint to strike them that year.|$|E
25|$|The half guineas of George III weighed 4.2grams {{and were}} 20 millimetres in {{diameter}} except from 1787 {{when they were}} 20-21 millimetres in diameter. They were issued with seven different <b>obverses</b> and three reverses in 1762-1766, 1768, 1769, 1772–1779, 1781, 1783–1798, 1800–1806, 1808–1811 and 1813. All the <b>obverses</b> show right-facing busts of the king with the legend GEORGIVS III DEI GRATIA with different portraits of the king. The reverse of half guineas issued between 1761 and 1786 show a crowned shield bearing the arms of England+Scotland, France, Ireland and Hanover, with the legend M B F ET H REX F D B ET L D S R I A T ET E date. In 1787 a new design of reverse featuring a spade-shaped shield was introduced, with the same legend; this {{has become known as}} the Spade Half-Guinea.|$|R
25|$|The 2005 {{series has}} the same {{principal}} design, but with additional security features such as colour-shifting ink on the 50-rand and higher and the EURion constellation. The <b>obverses</b> of all denominations are printed in English, while two other languages are printed on the reverses, thus making use of all 11 official languages of South Africa.|$|R
5|$|In {{the medieval}} period some {{religious}} institutions displayed ancient Greek coins {{of the island}} of Rhodes as specimens of the Thirty Pieces of Silver. The <b>obverses</b> of these coins showed a facing head of the sun god Helios, with rays projecting around {{the upper part of}} it. These rays were interpreted as a representation of the Crown of Thorns.|$|R
