5|$|The Cathedral of San Giovanni Battista in Ragusa Superiore {{was built}} between 1718 and 1778. Its {{principal}} façade is pure Baroque, containing fine carvings and sculptures. The cathedral {{has a high}} Sicilian belfry in the same style. The ornate Baroque interior is separated into three colonnaded aisles (Illustration 3). Ragusa Superiore, the most badly damaged part of the town, was replanned following 1693 around the cathedral and displays an unusual phenomenon of Sicilian Baroque: the palazzi here are peculiar to this town, of only two storeys and long, with the central bay only emphasised by a balcony and an arch to the inner garden. This very Portuguese style, probably designed to minimise damage in future earthquakes, {{is very different from}} the palazzi in Ragusa Ibla, which are in true Sicilian style. Unusually, Baroque lingered <b>on</b> <b>here</b> until the early 19th century. The last palazzo built here was in the Baroque form but with columns of Roman Doric and neoclassical balconies.|$|E

Created by Michael Costanza and {{directed}} by Sam Irvin, the series combines elements of the horror and soap opera genres in {{telling the story of}} Kevin (Gregory Michael) and Toby (Charlie David), a young couple seeking to be together and to overcome the dark mystical forces that conspire to separate them. The show debuted to a mixed critical reception. Although an announcement was made regarding a fourth season, no fourth season was produced.|$|E

25|$|Fairly {{straightforward}} statistics provide {{estimates of}} whether associations between genes on lists {{are greater than}} what one would expect by chance. These statistics are interesting, even if they represent a substantial oversimplification of {{what is really going}} <b>on.</b> <b>Here</b> is an example. Suppose there are 10,000 genes in an experiment, only 50 (0.5%) of which play a known role in making cholesterol. The experiment identifies 200 regulated genes. Of those, 40 (20%) turn out to be on a list of cholesterol genes as well. Based on the overall prevalence of the cholesterol genes (0.5%) one expects an average of 1 cholesterol gene for every 200 regulated genes, that is, 0.005 times 200. This expectation is an average, so one expects to see more than one some of the time. The question becomes how often we would see 40 instead of 1 due to pure chance.|$|E
25|$|The wetland {{ecosystem}} and wildlife habitat on several kilometres of less polluted Najafgarh drain in rural Delhi {{before entering the}} main city, including the former Najafgarh lake or Najafgarh jheel area, is very important habitat to migratory waterbirds {{as well as local}} wildlife. It has been earmarked to be declared a bird sanctuary for Delhi. The area came to be recognised as an important wildlife habitat after a local naturalist studying the area during 1986 to 1989 called attention to it, recommending it to be conserved as a bird sanctuary. After this, the Delhi wildlife department posted 16 guards in the area to control illegal bird hunters, including diplomats from various international embassies located in Delhi, India's capital. Delhi Administration officials were tasked with declaring about 25km stretch of the drain in rural Delhi, including where it passes through the core area of the now drained Najafgarh Lake or jheel, protected under the Wildlife Act after Lt. Governor of Delhi Mr. H.L. Kapur was invited to the area for touring the site where he also heard accounts of local villagers about the rampant illegal hunting of waterbirds that went <b>on</b> <b>here</b> every year. The existing staff of the Flood Control and Irrigation Department, numbering about 40, were also given the additional responsibility of protecting the wildlife on and around the drain.|$|E

500|$|The songs <b>on</b> <b>Here</b> Come the Warm Jets {{reference}} various {{musical styles}} {{from the past}} and present. The overall style of the album has been described as [...] "glammed-up art-pop", showcasing glam rock's simple yet theatrical crunchy guitar rock and art pop's sonic texture and avant-garde influences. In some tracks, Eno's vocals emulate the manner of the lead singer of his former band Roxy Music, Bryan Ferry. On other songs such as [...] "Baby's on Fire", they were described as [...] "more nasal and slightly snotty vocals". AllMusic |last=Huey |first=Steve |website=AllMusic |accessdate=21 December 2014}} Musically, the album borrows from popular styles of the music in the 1950s such as the tinkling pianos and falsetto backing vocals on [...] "Cindy Tells Me", and the drum rhythm of [...] "Blank Frank", taken from Bo Diddley's song [...] "Who Do You Love?".|$|E
500|$|Cody Miller of PopMatters was {{positive}} regarding the song, writing: [...] "When a real hook pops up, as on 'Remember December', Lovato really bites into it, belting and howling with enough melodrama and bravado to actually make one believe [...] lines." [...] Tamar Anitai of MTV Buzzworthy named the track the fifth best song of 2009, calling it [...] "the strongest and best" [...] <b>on</b> <b>Here</b> We Go Again. Anitai wrote, [...] "'Remember December' {{is a serious}} standout that quickly makes it point with Demi behind the wheel – seriously speeding – the whole time. It's the perfect showcase for Demi's way-beyond-her-years vocals and ability to sell a song without sugar-coating it." [...] In a more mixed review, Nick Levine of Digital Spy awarded it three out of five stars and said that it lacked [...] "original ideas", but said that it [...] "does {{at least have a}} decent chorus". Levine called it a [...] "Veronicas-lite pop-rock stomper" [...] and praised Lovato's vocals.|$|E

Beyoncé delivers half-rapped verses on {{the first half of}} the song, in which the female protagonist teases male subjects in a club as she turns heads. In the first verse, she warns the other women in the club, [...] "Every girl <b>on</b> <b>here</b> gotta look me up and down / All on Instagram cake by the pound". The singer adds on the second verse, [...] "I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker." [...] "Yoncé" [...] closes with the bridge as Beyoncé sings repeatedly, [...] "Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor", while an ascending siren echoes over a staccato bass that hits heavily and uniformly in the background.|$|E

500|$|To {{create the}} lyrics, Eno would later play these backing tracks singing {{nonsense}} syllables to himself, then take them and form them into actual words, phrases and meaning. This lyric-writing method {{was used for}} all his more vocal-based recordings of the 1970s. The lyrics <b>on</b> <b>Here</b> Come the Warm Jets are macabre with an underlying sense of humour. They are mostly free-associative and have no particular meaning. Exceptions include [...] "The Paw Paw Negro Blowtorch", about the historical A.W. Underwood of Paw Paw, Michigan with the purported ability to set items ablaze with his breath; according to Eno, the song [...] "celebrates {{the possibility of a}} love affair with the man." [...] Eno has attempted to dissuade fans from reading too much into his words; he claims that the song [...] "Needles in the Camel's Eye" [...] was [...] "written in less time than it takes to sing... I regard [...] as an instrumental with singing on it".|$|E
500|$|Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph {{was more}} {{critical}} with the episode, stating, [...] "having {{set up an}} interesting cliffhanger last week, it was a tad annoying that Steven Moffat did his trick again of taking a swerve with the pre-credits section of this week's episode, and more supposed shock value with the shootings of Amy and Rory," [...] but also more annoyed [...] "that what exactly was going <b>on</b> <b>here,</b> {{and how it was}} influenced by the events of the previous episode, were never exactly explained, leaving the audience to fill in the blanks." [...] Fuller believed that the plot and ending [...] "only raised more questions than answers," [...] believing that the overarching storyline would [...] "require the audience's concentration over many weeks; any casual viewer tuning in this week, and I suspect not a few fans, will have been left baffled by the goings-on," [...] but still felt the episode [...] "was interesting and showed just how, when the writers use their imagination, Doctor Who can tell stories in a way little else on television can." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{contemporary}} reviews, Peter Paphides {{wrote in}} Melody Maker that the EP was [...] "25 minutes of snowblind glory waiting {{here if you}} want them.

Codeine have hit upon a formula so pure and righteous it would be tragic for them to deviate from it." [...] The Washington Post gave the album a mixed review, explaining that [...] "There's not a lot going <b>on</b> <b>here,</b> but songs such as [...] "Realize" [...] and [...] "Hard to Find" [...] are hardly nothing." [...] and that tracks such as [...] "W." [...] allow Codeine to achieve [...] "both earthly aggression and unearthly calm." [...] Charles Aaron of Spin, reviewed the single [...] "Realize", stating that the song [...] "inches along as if Codeine's still wondering whether it's worth the effort". The b-side [...] "Broken-hearted Wine" [...] was described as a song that [...] "coolly walks a delicate line between delibitating sadness and cartoon regret." ...|$|E

Lucie Arnaz remained with Here's Lucy until the show ended in the spring of 1974.|$|R
500|$|Malley's stay {{increasingly}} involved him in {{the fighting}} in China; his wife would relate three years of night-time air raids to her friends upon the couple's return to Australia in 1940. In May 1938, he advised the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice-Marshal Richard Williams: [...] "there is a first-class war <b>on</b> <b>here,</b> which must eventually affect Australia and its defence schemes". Williams {{and other members of}} the RAAF may, however, have perceived Malley as exaggerating the importance of his role in China, particularly given his apparent delight in its ceremonial aspects. In one letter, he regaled Williams with stories of an inspection tour around the country, declaring: [...] "I... can just imagine how much you would have enjoyed it– landing on aerodromes that were all polished up for inspection. Being met by provincial dignitaries and lavishly entertained. I had to drink every conceivable Chinese wine that was ever made, and to eat foods unheard of in Australia!" [...] At any rate, Malley's reports of Japanese air tactics, and the value his observations might have held for Australia in the event of war in the Pacific, were largely discounted by his home government.|$|E

[...] He described the experience as [...] "good, clean, and humorous. And we need more of that around." [...] According to Mirkin, the writers like to give guest stars awkward lines which then sound funny coming from them. They knew Brown would not be [...] "the greatest actor in the world" [...] but still [...] "gave him these incredibly hilarious, stiff lines that killed." [...] Mirkin described Brown's line as [...] "horrible" [...] but because of Brown's reading, [...] "you have something that just sounds perfectly wrong {{and it makes it}} funny." [...] In his book Planet Simpson, Chris Turner describes James Brown's performance as [...] "hilariously over-the-top" [...] and uses it {{as an example of how}} the early seasons of the show would include celebrity cameos and not point out the [...] "enormity of their fame".|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{her first}} studio album, Don't Forget, Lovato did not {{collaborate}} with the Jonas Brothers <b>on</b> <b>Here</b> We Go Again as {{she wanted to}} see what her sound would be like without their input.

[...] However, Lovato did work with Nick Jonas on the song [...] "Stop the World". The majority of the album was produced by John Fields, who also handled production on Don't Forget. Other tracks were produced by SuperSpy, Gary Clark, Andy Dodd and Adam Watts. [...] "Catch Me" [...] is the only song on the album for which Lovato received sole writing credit. In an interview with The New York Times, she revealed that she wrote it in her room and that it means more to her {{than the rest of the}} album.|$|E
