40|$|The paper proposes an {{analysis}} of money which starts from electronic money. In open contradiction to the traditional approach, characterized by {{a general lack of}} interest by theoreticians towards payment system issues, the paper argues that analysis of the distinctive characteristics of electronic money is bound to contribute to received monetary theory. After indicating the distinguishing properties of electronic money (which derive entirely from its technical features), the paper outlines their consequences on the principles of monetary theory. It is argued that recognition of the fact that electronic money is nominal money issued in an operation of <b>monetary</b> <b>intermediation,</b> provides an analytical framework for a better understanding of electronic money issuance, {{as well as of the}} meaning of issuing money. The analysis will show that only a deep analysis into the very nature of bank money can provide a better understanding of phenomena such as electronic money, which is consistent with the evolution of financial and banking innovations, in particular with the rise of interest bearing mediums of exchange.

40|$|The thesis {{faces the}} theme of the <b>monetary</b> <b>intermediation</b> of the bankers in the Roman Law era. In particular, the work focuses on the receptum argentarii, the promise of payment issued by a Roman banker on account of his client and in favour of a third person. In spite of the severe {{scarcity}} of historiographical sources, Lenel’s palingenetic studies have determined a breakthrough {{in the study of the}} receptum argentarii, thus permitting some hypothesis on its concrete function in the Roman legal and economic practice. The thesis investigates the main sources and scholarly opinions about the receptum in the attempt of providing a comprehensive overview and achieving a deeper understanding ot the theme. Being the receptum always linked to a ratio (the Roman “bank account”) and owing to the extremely strict liability of the banker towards the creditors, the banker’s promise was a significantly ductile legal institute. The research shows that the promise of payment issued by a banker should be considered not only as a form of suretyship, but also as a means of fulfilment through a third party, with the argentarius acting simultaneously as a guarantor and as a payment intermediary of his customer. In conclusion, although direct archaeological and historiographical evidence is still missing, the thesis argues the receptum argentarii was probably used as a payment instrument at least in the classic and post-classic period of the Roman law era...|$|R
