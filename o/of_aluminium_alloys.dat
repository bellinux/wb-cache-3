5|$|Metallic {{scandium}} {{was produced}} {{for the first}} time in 1937 by electrolysis of a eutectic mixture of potassium, lithium, and scandium chlorides, at 700–800°C. The first pound of 99% pure scandium metal was produced in 1960. Production <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> began in 1971, following a US patent. Aluminium-scandium alloys were also developed in the USSR.|$|E
5|$|The {{airframe}} is of semi-monocoque structure constructed primarily <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys.</b> High strength {{steel and}} titanium alloys are partially adopted in some critical areas. The airframe {{is designed for}} a service life of 4,000 flight hours or 25 years, the first overhaul being due at 1,200 flight hours. Block 2 JF-17s incorporate greater use of composite materials in the airframe to reduce weight. The retractable undercarriage has a tricycle arrangement with a single steerable nose-wheel and two main undercarriages. The hydraulic brakes have an automatic anti-skid system. The position {{and shape of the}} inlets is designed to give the required airflow to the jet engine during manoeuvres involving high angles of attack.|$|E
25|$|An {{inclusion}} is a metal {{contamination of}} dross, if solid, or slag, if liquid. These usually are impurities in the pour metal (generally oxides, less frequently nitrides, carbides, or sulfides), {{material that is}} eroded from furnace or ladle linings, or contaminates from the mold. In the specific case <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys,</b> {{it is important to}} control the concentration of inclusions by measuring them in the liquid aluminium and taking actions to keep them to the required level.|$|E

25|$|The Be-200 is a high-wing T-tail monoplane. {{the hull}} is of single step design {{with a high}} length-to-beam ratio, which {{contributes}} to stability and controllability in water. The Be-200 airframe is constructed <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> with corrosion-protection treatments. Selective use is made of titanium, composites and other corrosion-free materials. The wings are fitted with underwing stabiliser floats. The hydraulically operated retractable landing gear units all retract rearward, and each unit is twin-wheeled. A water rudder provides steering in the water.|$|E
25|$|The F-111 was an {{all-weather}} attack aircraft, {{capable of}} low-level penetration of enemy defenses to deliver ordnance on the target. The F-111 featured variable-geometry wings, an internal weapons bay and a cockpit with side-by-side seating. The cockpit {{was part of}} an escape crew capsule. The wing sweep varied between 16 degrees and 72.5 degrees (full forward to full sweep). The wing included leading edge slats and double slotted flaps over its full length. The airframe was made up mostly <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> with steel, titanium and other materials used in places. The fuselage was made of a semi-monocoque structure with stiffened panels and honeycomb structure panels for skin.|$|E
500|$|The {{absence of}} reliable, secure, stable, and {{long-term}} production has limited commercial applications of scandium. Despite this {{low level of}} use, scandium offers significant benefits. Particularly promising is the strengthening <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> with as little as 0.5% scandium. Scandium-stabilized zirconia enjoys a growing market demand {{for use as a}} high-efficiency electrolyte in solid oxide fuel cells.|$|E

2500|$|Lockheed Martin's {{design for}} Advanced Composite Cargo Aircraft (ACCA) was chosen over Aurora Flight Sciences' design {{based on the}} Antonov An-72 in 2007.

40|$|The {{quasi-static}} flexural {{and impact}} performance, up to projectile impact velocities of about 270 m s− 1, of fibre metal laminates (FMLs), which consist of relatively thin, alternately stacked, layers <b>of</b> an <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> and a thermoset glass fibre epoxy composite, have been investigated. The effects of varying (a) the yield strength, tensile {{strength and ductility}} <b>of</b> the <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> layer, (b) the surface treatment used for the <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> layers and (c) the number of layers present in the FML have been studied. It was found that increasing the strength <b>of</b> the <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> increases the quasi-static flexural strength of the FML, providing that good adhesion is achieved between the metal and the composite layers. Further, {{increasing the number of}} alternating layers <b>of</b> the <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> and fibre composite also somewhat increases the quasi-static flexural properties of the FML. In contrast, increasing the strength <b>of</b> the <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> had relatively little effect on the impact perforation resistance of the FML, but increasing the number of alternating layers <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> and fibre composite did significantly increase the impact perforation resistance of the FML. The degree of adhesion achieved between the layers had only a negligible influence on the impact perforation resistance...|$|R

50|$|Another {{important}} property <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> is {{sensitivity to}} heat. Workshop procedures are {{complicated by the}} fact that aluminium, unlike steel, melts without first glowing red. Manual blow torch operations require additional skill and experience. Aluminium alloys, like all structural alloys, are subject to internal stresses after heat operations such as welding and casting. The lower melting points <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> make them more susceptible to distortions from thermally induced stress relief. Stress can be relieved and controlled during manufacturing by heat-treating the parts in an oven, followed by gradual cooling—in effect annealing the stresses.|$|E
