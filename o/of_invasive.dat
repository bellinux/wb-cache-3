40|$|Retired {{farmland}} in {{the western}} San Joaquin Valley (SJV) of California is frequently colonized by invasive plants that may limit the establishment of native flora. Limited ecophysiological data on native and invasive SJV plant species constrains science-based restoration of native flora. This greenhouse evaluation involved a comparison of photosynthetic rates, in vivo nitrate reductase activity (NRA), and biomass accumulation <b>of</b> two <b>invasive</b> annuals and three native annual species. At 35 d and 75 d, 15 individuals were harvested to determine total biomass. Photosynthesis was measured using a Li-Cor Li- 6400 and in vivo NRA was measured in roots and leaves. At harvest 1, the photosynthetic rate <b>of</b> <b>invasives</b> (15. 5 ?? 0. 56 _moles CO 2 ??m- 2 ??s- 1) was greater (p< 0. 05) than natives (10. 6 ?? 0. 43 _moles CO 2 ??m- 2 ??s- 1). Natives significantly exceeded (p< 0. 05) the water use efficiency <b>of</b> <b>invasives</b> by 22 % and 31 % at harvest 1 and 2, respectively. In all species, leaf NRA exceeded root NRA (p< 0. 001; p< 0. 05). The total biomass <b>of</b> <b>invasives</b> significantly exceeded (p< 0. 05) that of natives at harvest 1 and 2 (0. 25 ?? 0. 003 g and 0. 46 ?? 0. 002 g, respectively). By harvest 2, the relative growth rate (RGR) of natives (0. 069 ?? 0. 03 g??g- 1 ??d- 1) exceeded invasives (0. 043 ?? 0. 07 g??g- 1 ??d- 1, p< 0. 05).

5|$|Habitat {{destruction}} {{represents a}} threat to biodiversity in Croatia, as developed and agricultural land is expanded into previous natural habitats, while habitat fragmentation occurs as roads are created or expanded. A further threat to biodiversity is the introduction <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> species, with Caulerpa racemosa and C. taxifolia identified as especially problematic ones. The invasive algae are monitored and regularly removed to protect the benthic habitat. Agricultural monocultures have also been identified as {{a threat to}} biodiversity.|$|E
5|$|About 12,500 {{species of}} insects are native to Florida, {{most of which}} {{naturally}} flew into the region from the Caribbean or Southeastern United States. An additional 1,000 {{have been identified as}} exotic. Insects create about $1 billion of damage to structures and agriculture in Florida each year. The tide of arriving insects is nearly impossible to control with the volume of goods and shipments coming into South Florida. Imported citrus is a major avenue for damaging insects. Twenty-one species have been imported and released to act as biological control agents: to impede the growth <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> plants or counter the effects of other insects. Others, such as the Madagascan hissing cockroach (Gromphadorhina portentosa) and European cricket (Acheta domesticus) are sold as pets or fishing bait, and are then released into backyards. Similarly, aquatic invertebrates such as mussels, clams, snails, and melania find their ways into local waters from the bottoms of ships or in bilge holds. The aquarium trade also supplies enthusiasts with exotic species which are dumped or escape into waterways.|$|E
40|$|Species {{categories}} {{commonly used}} in nature conservation, such as protected, endangered, reintroduced,or invasive, are open to various interpretations that can result in diverging and sometimes serious con-sequences. This is vividly apparent with respect to invasiveness because the categorization of speciesand individual animals as invasive impacts on how they are treated in practice. This article demonstrateshow different constructions of invasiveness in science, policy, and wildlife management can be tracedback to different assessments of the origin, behavior, and impact <b>of</b> the <b>invasives.</b> Specifically, the focus ison the different conceptions of space {{and the role of}} data in the categorization <b>of</b> <b>invasives.</b> We find that,in science and policy, invasiveness is constructed mainly in terms of the origin and impact of invasivesbut that these domains differ in how they treat space in their assessment of origin: whereas scienceuses ecological spaces, such as biogeographical regions, to assess whether a species belongs to, or isinvasive in, a certain area, policy uses policy spaces such as countries or states to do so. In assessing theimpact <b>of</b> <b>invasives,</b> science argues about including it in its definition, whereas policy requires detaileddata about ecological, societal, and economic damage in order to take action. In wildlife management,the focus in the construction of invasiveness shifts from origin and impact to behavior <b>of</b> <b>invasives.</b> Thisrequires detailed data about where the invasives are, where they are going, and what they are doing. By showing the dynamic and context-specific nature of the construction of invasiveness, the article con-tributes to ongoing research about classifications of nature, their difficulties and ambiguities, and theirimplementation and consequences in practice...|$|R

5|$|Hawaii's {{geographical}} isolation strongly influences its ecology. Remote islands like Hawaii have a {{large number}} of species that are found nowhere else (see Endemism in the Hawaiian Islands). The remoteness resulted in evolutionary lines distinct from those elsewhere and isolated these endemic species from external biotic influence, and also makes them especially vulnerable to extinction and the effects <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> species. In addition the ecosystems of Hawaii are under threat from human development including the clearing of land for agriculture; an estimated third of the island's endemic species have already been wiped out. Because of its elevation, Mauna Kea has the greatest diversity of biotic ecosystems anywhere in the Hawaiian archipelago. Ecosystems on the mountain form concentric rings along its slopes due to changes in temperature and precipitation with elevation. These ecosystems can be roughly divided into three sections by elevation: alpine–subalpine, montane, and basal forest.|$|E
5|$|Humans play a {{key role}} in the biosphere, with the large human {{population}} dominating many of Earth's ecosystems. This has resulted in a widespread, ongoing mass extinction of other species during the present geological epoch, now known as the Holocene extinction. The large-scale loss of species caused by human influence since the 1950s has been called a biotic crisis, with an estimated 10% of the total species lost as of 2007. At current rates, about 30% of species are at risk of extinction in the next hundred years. The Holocene extinction event is the result of habitat destruction, the widespread distribution <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> species, hunting, and climate change. In the present day, human activity has had a significant impact on the surface of the planet. More than a third of the land surface has been modified by human actions, and humans use about 20% of global primary production. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by close to 30% since the start of the Industrial Revolution.|$|E
5|$|In July 2006, a cull <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> brown rats on the Scottish {{island of}} Canna was deemed a {{provisional}} success and {{after two years}} of observation, during which time no rats were observed, the island was declared officially rat free by the Environment Minister, Mike Russell on 7 June 2008. The rats had been outcompeting the rare local wood mouse, known as the Canna mouse and also endangering local seabird populations. The National Trust for Scotland which own the island invested £500,000 employing exterminators from New Zealand to cull the estimated 10,000 brown rats. in co-operation with RZSS, approximately 150 Canna mice were captured and homed at Edinburgh Zoo and the Highland Wildlife Park. 40 mice were returned to the island in late 2006 with the remaining being re-introduced in stages.|$|E

5|$|In {{cases of}} massive and severe {{infection}} <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> pests, techniques of pest control {{are often used}} in combination. An example is the emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis, an invasive beetle from China, which has destroyed {{tens of millions of}} ash trees in its introduced range in North America. As part of the campaign against it, from 2003 American scientists and the Chinese Academy of Forestry searched for its natural enemies in the wild, leading to the discovery of several parasitoid wasps, namely Tetrastichus planipennisi, a gregarious larval endoparasitoid, Oobius agrili, a solitary, parthenogenic egg parasitoid, and Spathius agrili, a gregarious larval ectoparasitoid. These have been introduced and released into the United States of America as a possible biological control of the emerald ash borer. Initial results for Tetrastichus planipennisi have shown promise, and it is now being released along with Beauveria bassiana, a fungal pathogen with known insecticidal properties.|$|E
5|$|Several {{conservation}} {{measures have been}} undertaken or proposed to protect this species. Inaccessible Island was once suggested as a site for agriculture for Tristan Islanders, which would have reduced habitat and risked the introduction <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> species. However the island was declared a nature reserve by the Tristan da Cunha Island Council in 1994. Access to the island is restricted now, although Tristan Islanders are still permitted to visit the island to collect firewood and guano. Introduced New Zealand flax {{has been removed from}} the island, and the island now has a management plan. Other suggestions for securing this species' future include increased education on biosecurity for the local community, and potentially setting up a captive population. It has also been suggested that backup populations be established on other secure islands, for example Nightingale Island, in case predators reached Inaccessible Island, but this may have negative impacts on the endemic invertebrate faunas of these islands.|$|E
5|$|Sheep {{are largely}} grazing herbivores, unlike {{browsing}} {{animals such as}} goats and deer that prefer taller foliage. With a much narrower face, sheep crop plants {{very close to the}} ground and can overgraze a pasture much faster than cattle. For this reason, many shepherds use managed intensive rotational grazing, where a flock is rotated through multiple pastures, giving plants time to recover. Paradoxically, sheep can both cause and solve the spread <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> plant species. By disturbing the natural state of pasture, sheep and other livestock can pave the way for invasive plants. However, sheep also prefer to eat invasives such as cheatgrass, leafy spurge, kudzu and spotted knapweed over native species such as sagebrush, making grazing sheep effective for conservation grazing. Research conducted in Imperial County, California compared lamb grazing with herbicides for weed control in seedling alfalfa fields. Three trials demonstrated that grazing lambs were just as effective as herbicides in controlling winter weeds. Entomologists also compared grazing lambs to insecticides for insect control in winter alfalfa. In this trial, lambs provided insect control as effectively as insecticides.|$|E

However, the broader use and impact <b>of</b> the <b>invasive</b> management approach has not been established for patients with acute coronary syndromes beyond the relatively narrow patient populations studied in randomized, clinical trials. METHODS: Residents of the Worcester, Mass, area who were hospitalized with non-Q-wave acute myocardial infarction (AMI) at all area hospitals in 5 annual periods between 1990 and 1997 comprised the sample of interest (n = 2436). We examined the extent of use <b>of</b> an <b>invasive</b> versus a conservative strategy for hospital management, occurrence of clinical complications, and hospital mortality in patients with non-Q-wave AMI. RESULTS: An invasive approach to hospital management was used in only 30 % of patients with non-Q-wave AMI, although {{there was an increase}} over time in the use <b>of</b> an <b>invasive</b> treatment strategy (18 % in 1990 vs 33 % in 1997). Factors associated with use <b>of</b> the <b>invasive</b> strategy were younger age, male sex, development of cardiogenic shock, as well as adjunctive medical treatment. Overall hospital mortality was high at 12 %. Use <b>of</b> the <b>invasive</b> approach, aspirin, nitrates and beta-blockers were associated in logistic regression modeling with significant improvements in survival. CONCLUSIONS: An invasive approach to hospital management of non-Q-wave AMI was used infrequently in this population-based cohort during the 1990 s...|$|R

5|$|The Shinano basin {{supports}} a large range of plant life, including over 1,100 species of plant which grow {{on the river}} bank, in the river bed or more broadly. The basin also {{supports a}} large range of animal life both {{in and around the}} river. However, the development of the river has threatened the continuing existence of a number of different species. Across the country, thirty to fifty (or higher) percent of endangered species are from freshwater river systems and the impact on the Shinano river system is also clear. Primarily this affects fish and amphibians due to their reliance on the river. The construction of weirs and dams to support agriculture and industry as well as the introduction <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> species and pollution have been the main causes of ecosystem degradation. The Shinano basin provides a habitat for around twenty-five percent of Japan's fish species (around fifty-five of the 200 fish species living in Japan) including both endemic freshwater fish as well as diadromous fish.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of large dams, {{especially in the}} mid and {{upper reaches of the}} system have significantly affected the ability of fish to migrate up and down the river, and into the Sea of Japan. There has also been {{a significant increase in the}} amount of fishing which takes place in the system which is associated with the introduction <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> fish species and waterbirds into the system. The development of the river, and human settlement, has also resulted in the environmental degradation of key fish habitat. Changes in the system have affected its ability to support and maintain fish species which are endemic to the river. Some actions have been taken to overcome these issues, including prohibitions on fishing salmon during breeding and stocking certain areas for fishing, especially in areas where Tsukeba fish shacks (popup stores along the riverbank) are regularly set up.|$|E
