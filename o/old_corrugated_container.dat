This study examines the soda-antraquinone (soda-AQ) pulp of kenaf fibers versus <b>old</b> <b>corrugated</b> <b>container</b> (OCC) and unbleached softwood kraft pulps as the main sources for linerboard production. The results showed significant differences among the pulp properties. The unbleached kraft pulp with very high freeness required high beating to reach an optimized freeness and produced paper with the highest strength properties, except for tear resistance. The OCC gave paper with the lowest strength properties. In the case of kenaf fractions, bast pulp with high freeness needed less beating than softwood and produced paper with high tear resistance. Core fiber, which had the lowest freeness and highest drainage time, led to paper with high strength but very low tear resistance. Kenaf whole stem pulp showed intermediate properties between core and bast and close to those of unbleached softwood pulp, but with very lower beating requirement. Finally, kenaf whole stem, due to its strength properties, moderate separation cost, and simple pulping process, was judged to be more suitable for commercialization for linerboard production in Malaysia...|$|E

The mill and adjacent converting complex was opened in 1956 by Crown Zellerbach to use pulp from British Columbia to make tissue, toweling, multiwall bags, and linerboard for the northern California market. The pulp was delivered by company ship to the Antioch mill's deep-water dock on the San Joaquin River. Eventually the consumer products were phased out and the mill downsized to a single Fourdrinier paper machine (260 in wide), which produced linerboard and corrugating medium for corrugated boxes.

The as-obtained PVA/SBR/CMC/HNTs nanocomposites were coated {{on the surface}} of <b>old</b> <b>corrugated</b> <b>container</b> (OCC) -based paper in an effort to improve the mechanical properties of paper. To improve the dispersion of HNTs and enhance the compatibility between HNTs and polymer matrix, HNTs were modified with titanate coupling agent (TCA). FT-IR, together with TGA, confirmed that TCA was grafted onto the surface of HNTs successfully. XRD demonstrated that the crystal structures of HNTs remained almost unchanged. TEM showed that modified HNTs exhibited good dispersion and possessed nanotubular structures with an outer diameter of around 50 [*]nm and an inner diameter of about 20 [*]nm. SEM gave an indication that modified HNTs were dispersed more uniformly than unmodified HNTs within PVA/SBR/CMC matrix. Rheological measurement exhibited that surface modification process enhanced the compatibility between HNTs and polymer matrix, thus resulting in the decreased viscosity of nanocomposites. In comparison with unmodified HNTs, modified HNTs were found to contribute more to the enhancement in mechanical properties, which might be attributed to the better dispersion and compatibility of modified HNTs evidenced by TEM, SEM, and rheological measurement...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, <b>Old</b> <b>Corrugated</b> <b>Container</b> (OCC) {{was used}} as the raw {{material}} for making paper. The layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly process of creating highly structured thin films was adopted to modify the surface of OCC fibres. Poly dimethyldiallylammonium chloride (PDADMAC) and hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) have been used to build up polyelectrolyte multilayers on OCC fibres under a certain condition. Zeta potential analyzer was used to monitor the dynamic adsorption of PDADMAC and HEC with different amount on OCC fibers. Strength measurements of the sheets including tensile index and bursting index were also determined, showing a significant improvement in physical strength with the increase of adsorbed layer number. Compared with not being processed sheets, tensile index and bursting index of sheets from treated fibre with polyelectrolyte multilayers were raised by 36. 65 % and 49. 50 %, respectively. Furthermore, filtration time analysis of OCC fibre suspension showed that the built up of PDADMAC and HEC on OCC fibres could improve the fiber-fiber joint strength of joints from polymer-treated fibers, which made the filtration time decline from 30 s to 10. 6 s. In addition, SEM was introduced to observe the morphology of the PDADMAC/HEC multilayers. The images revealed that the surface of OCC fibres structured a film like plastic, which could be ascribed to the adsorption layer of polyelectrolyte...|$|E
40|$|Effects of {{moisture}} on the mechanical properties of one commercial solid fiberboard grade {{and on the}} compression strength of mill-fabricated transport boxes made from this material were studied. The solid fiberboard (1220 g/m 2) has four middle layers made of <b>old</b> <b>corrugated</b> <b>container</b> (OCC). The middle layers are strongly internally sized with rosin sizing. The outer layers on both sides are made of bleached machine finished kraft paper. The kraft paper has extrusion coated low-density polyethylene (LDPE) doublelayer as moisture barrier. The six paper and paperboard layers are glued together in an industrial lamination process. The boxes have unusual design including double-panel walls and webbed corners, and they are used in wet and humid conditions for transporting fresh round fish. The transportation takes up to eight days at the ambient environment of 4 Â°C and 90 - 100 % RH. These conditions are taken as {{the framework of the}} study. Results show that the LDPE coating considerably slows down the transverse moisture penetration. The in-plane diffusivity (5. 9 Â· 10 - 10 m 2 /s, 27 Â°C, 50 / 90 % RH) was determined with an integrated unsteady state moisture transport model and was found to be nine times higher than the transverse diffusivity through the PE layer. Based on the diffusivity, water vapor can theoretically affect 80 mm from the open unsealed board edge during transport. Experiments show that liquid water penetrates 40 - 50 mm during eight days. In the middle of the sheet the moisture content increases moderately, approximately 0. 3 percentage points during transport. The packaging producerâs main concern is thus to ensure that the open material edges are at least 80 mm away from the load bearing sections of the box. Due to uneven moisture penetration into the boxes, the average moisture of a box is a questionable measure {{of moisture}} pick-up. Instead one should consider the moisture content of the load bearing parts. The role of the adhesion layers in bending stiffness of the solid paperboard was modeled with laminate models. Results show that the adhesion layers affect the mechanical properties of the combined board and need to be addressed in the models. Best agreement with the measured bending stiffness values was obtained by a 11 -layer model, where the properties of the adhesion layers are taken from the paper-glue-paper sandwich tests. The PE and kraft paper are regarded as one layer in the model. With this model, the calculated bending stiffnesses are close to the measured reference at 50 % RH in MD (difference 1 %). In 90 % RH and in MD the results are 14 % lower. Neglecting the adhesion layers gives 5 % lower values in 50 % RH and 18 % in 90 % RH compared to the reference measurement in MD. In each of the cases, the difference from reference is larger for the CD material direction. Three thickness measurement techniques (ISO, STFI, and SEM) were used to gather input data for the bending stiffness model. In this application, the ISO technique provided best results compared to the other techniques. It was found that the top-to bottom failure of a box can be expressed as a critical vertical displacement that is independent of moisture content. Similar results have been previously discovered when studying simpler structures like corrugated board panels and regular slotted containers (RSC). This research indicates that the strain dependent failure criterion also applies on more complex box structures.

A combination of one of the three active alkali levels (14, 16, and 18 %; Na 2 O, and oven-dry weight of OCC); one of two pulping temperatures (145 and 175 ÂºC), and one of two pulping times (60 and 120 minutes) and sodium sulfite to sodium hydroxide ratio of 30 / 70 (mol/mol) were examined. After preliminary pulping and evaluation, pulp with a kappa number of 18. 3 and brightness of 50. 2 %, which was produced applying 18 % active alkali, sodium sulfite to sodium hydroxide ratio of 30 : 70, and pulping time and temperature of 120 minutes and 175 ÂºC, respectively, having the yield of 64. 0 % (based on oven dry weight of washed OCC) and 72. 7 % (based on original weight of the OCC as received), respectively, was selected for totally chlorine free (TCF) bleaching trials.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{for the work}} described in this PhD thesiswas to formulate a friction model to characterize thefrictional behavior of paper. More specifically, the modelshould explain a phenomenon that is typical for paper grades,viz. : {{that the level of}} paper-to-paper friction is dependent onthe direction and the number of previous slides. The modelshould also explain the lubricating effect oflow-molecular-mass lipophilic compounds (LLC) that occur inpaper on paper-to-paper friction. Furthermore, the model shoulddescribe the types of forces that influence paper-to-paperfiction and explain the mechanism by which the LLC decreasepaper-to-paper friction. This thesis consists of a literature review of the basicconcepts of tribology and a summary of the main results andconclusions from four studies on the frictional characteristicsof paper and a study on the friction and adhesion of cellulosesurfaces together with some unpublished material. The purpose of the investigation described in the firstpaper was to explain a phenomenon that is typical for papergrades, viz. : the level of paper-to-paper friction is dependenton the direction and the number of previous slides. Thisbehavior is called 9 Ì 3 friction hysteresis 9 Ì 4 by theauthors, and it has its origin in the reorientation of thefibers on the surface of a paper and their alignment relativeto the sliding direction. The second paper describes a study that was aimed atidentifying lubricants that occur natively in paper. Filterpapers were impregnated with model compounds representing woodextractives, i. e. low-molecular-weight lipophilic compounds,which are present in wood, pulp and paper, and thepaper-to-paper friction was determined. The results of thatstudy show that a wood extractive must fulfill severalstructural criteria in order to lubricate a paper surface: Itmust have a hydrophilic group that can attach to the papersurface and a linear hydrocarbon backbone of sufficientlength. Although it is not specifically stated in the second paper,the authors proposed a type of lubrication by which woodextractives decrease paper-to-paper friction that is, ineffect, boundary lubrication. The purpose of the investigationdescribed in the third paper was to clarify whether woodextractives and other low-molecular-mass lipophilic compoundsthat occur in paper can act as boundary lubricants on papersurfaces. The {{main objective}} of that study was to investigatethe role of chemical structure of LLC for their orientationrelative to the paper surface, which is an important criterionfor boundary lubrication. Filter papers were impregnated withmagnesium salts of different lipophilic acids, which were usedfor model compounds for the LLC. The deposited layers ofmagnesium salts were characterized by X-ray photoelectronspectroscopy (XPS) and contact angle goniometry and thefriction of the impregnated paper sheets was determined. Theresults show that the degree of lubrication and the resistanceto wear of the layers of a magnesium salt increased withincreasing chain length and increasing degree of linearity ofthe lipophilic acid. Based on the results of that study and ofearlier studies, it is concluded that boundary lubrication isthe type of lubrication by which low-molecular-mass lipophiliccompounds that occur natively in paper decreasepaper-to-paper-friction. In boundary lubrication, surfaces are covered withmonolayers of lubricant molecules that comprise an active headgroup that can attach to the surface, e. g. a carboxyl group,and an inert linear backbone, such as a long saturatedhydrocarbon chain. Such compounds form ordered monolayers onsurfaces, so that the backbone points vertically out of planeof the surface. The friction is then determined by theinteractions between the monolayers, which are weaker than theinteractions between the clean surfaces and this gives a lowerfriction. The fourth paper describes a study on the origin of thedifferences in friction levels between different linerboardsbased on recycled fiber (<b>old</b> <b>corrugated</b> <b>container,</b> OCC). Thesheets were subjected to two extraction stages and analyzedwith respect to surface roughness and their content oflow-molecular-mass lipophilic compounds (LLC). The resultsshowed that a high amount of LLC in the sheets lead to lowfriction, due to lubrication. The fifth paper describes a study that was aimed atdetermining the types of forces that influence the frictionbetween the surfaces of hydrophilic polymers and explaining themechanism by which boundary lubricants decrease the friction. The adhesion and the friction of model systems was measuredwith atomic force microscopy (AFM) using regenerated cellulosefilms and functionalised AFM tips and the effect of fatty acidsand humidity was investigated. The friction significantlyincreased with increasing humidity and that there was a strongcorrelation between the ability of a fatty acid to form ahydrophobic surface and its lubricating performance. Measuredadhesion forces at high humidity were well predicted bytheoretical models that took into account the effect of theLaplace pressure acting in a water meniscus formed aroundcontact regions due to capillary condensation. The resultsindicated that the degree of capillary condensation may beeffectively suppressed by increasing the hydrophobicity of thecontacting surfaces, causing adhesion and friction to decrease. These results suggest that friction between paper surfacesunder ambient conditions is greatly influenced by the degree ofcapillary condensation. Furthermore, lubrication by fatty acidsis achieved by the formation of a vertically oriented,hydrophobic monolayer that can withstand the stresses duringsliding and increase the hydrophobicity of the paper surfaceand thereby suppress capillary condensation.

40|$|Modern {{manufacturing}} processes assume efficient utilization and recycling {{of natural resources}} whenever possible. Over the past decade paper recycling has progressed from 33. 5 % in 1990 to just above 48 % in 2002. 1 Indeed, for certain select grades, (newspaper and <b>old</b> <b>corrugated</b> <b>containers)</b> greater than 70 % is currently being recycled. In contrast, mixed office waste and colored directory papers are often underutilized. A major difficulty in recycling these grades of paper is {{the problems associated with}} decolorizing the dyes present in the paper. 2 Of the commonly used paper dyes, the stilbene dye Direct Yellow 113 and methine dye Basazol 46 L are notorious 4 for poor bleachability with the commonly used chemical bleaching agents including chlorine dioxide, oxygen, hydrogen peroxide and sodium dithionite. The ability of white-rot fungi to decolorize colored effluents containing textile dyes is currently the subject of intensive research efforts. The secreted enzymes involved in dye decolorization include manganese peroxidase, lignin peroxidase and laccase. Laccase, a lignolytic enzyme, has also been studied for many years for the biobleaching of wood pulps. The ability of laccase to delignify pulp is greatly enhanced by the addition of small molecule mediators such as 2 - 2 Â´ azinobis (3 -ethylbenzthiazoline- 6 -sulfonate) (ABTS) and 1 -hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT). This research project focused on applying laccase combined with a mediator to decolorize C. I. Direct Yellow 11 and Basazol 46 L. Three mediators were tested: ABTS, HBT and violuric acid. Laccase/ABTS was most effective with 60 % of the color being removed. The level of color removal was maintained at 60 % even when ABTS concentration was lowered from 5 mM to 0. 01 mM. When laccase/ 1 mM ABTS was applied to Direct Yellow 11 in solution, the majority of color loss occurred within 60 minutes. The ability of soybean (SBP) and horseradish (HRP) peroxidases and laccase to decolorize Direct Yellow 11 and Basazol 46 L in solution was also examined. The results demonstrated that these two recalcitrant dyes could be effectively decolorized by enzymatic treatments by horseradish peroxidase, soybean peroxidase, and laccase with ABTS as mediator. SBP is effective from pH 4. 5 to 8. 5. The stilbene dye Direct Yellow 11 responded to both SBP and laccase/ABTS. For the methine dye Basazol 46 L, SBP was a more effective treatment than HRP or laccase/ABTS. Basazol 46 L responded quickly to SBP treatment with 74 % reduction in signal intensity within 5 minutes. To evaluate the effectiveness of laccase/ABTS treatment, pulp dyed with Direct Yellow 11 and three commercial colored pulps were subjected to seven different bleaching treatments. These treatments consisted of 1) laccase/ABTS; 2) laccase/ABTS followed by alkaline extraction; 3) laccase/ABTS followed by bleaching with sodium dithionite; 4) oxygen bleaching; 5) oxygen bleaching followed by dithionite treatment; 6) alkaline hydrogen peroxide bleaching; and 7) alkaline peroxide bleaching followed by dithionite treatment. The best results were obtained by including reductive bleaching with sodium dithionite. For Direct Yellow 11 dyed pulp, laccase/ABTS followed by dithionite yield comparable reduction in color to oxygen or peroxide followed by dithionite. Ph. D. Dr. A. J.

The life-span of loaded wax curtain coated test containers were also greater than of loaded standard test containers in every cyclic environment. The greater difference of temperature in cyclic environment resulted in greater moisture content change of corrugated material.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the feasibility of replacing a <b>corrugated</b> <b>container</b> with a multiwall paper bag for the packaging of food wraps used in the 2 Ì 2 Quick - Serve 2 Ì 2 foodservice industry. The study was limited to one specific restaurant chain and for only one size of food wraps. Laboratory testing was used to compare the performance attributes of both package systems. This study will provide a model for quantifying package source reduction when comparing a rigid package design to a flexible one. The results show that, indeed, a multiwall paper bag is a feasible alternative to a <b>corrugated</b> <b>container</b> when packaging food wraps and that significant source reduction can be realized from this change. Immediate and significant cost savings will also be achieved if the alternate package system is used for this foodservice application...|$|R

40|$|Firms in many sectors have {{achieved}} significant economies by taking advantages of opportunities {{made possible by}} innovation in trucking logistics. Transportation usually represents {{the single most important}} component in trucking logistics costs for most firms. Transportation costs are particularly important to the <b>corrugated</b> <b>container</b> industry. Averaging an estimated 12 to 20 % of total costs, transportation costs are a vital factor in the geographical scope of the markets producer can serve in addition to affecting the prices of production inputs and outputs. 	A natural question for the <b>corrugated</b> <b>container</b> industry is how improvements in the trucking logistics impacts a firms overall operating rate. The literature contains very little information on the relative costs and benefits of alternative logistic operations, including outsourcing, long term contracts, and private carrier. This research seeks to identify practices in trucking logistics that box plants might utilize to obtain materials and disburse products more economically. M. S.
