Irreconcilably alienated from his wife, Austin fell in love in 1882 with Mabel Loomis Todd, an Amherst College faculty wife who had recently moved to the area. Todd never met Dickinson but was intrigued by her, referring to her as [...] "a lady whom the people call the Myth". Austin distanced himself from his family as his affair continued and his wife became sick with grief. Dickinson's mother died on November 14, 1882.

[...] When confronted with the scandal, Cleveland immediately instructed his supporters to [...] "Above all, tell the truth." [...] Cleveland admitted to paying child support in 1874 to Maria Crofts Halpin, the woman who asserted he had fathered her son Oscar Folsom Cleveland and he assumed responsibility. Shortly before the 1884 election, the Republican media published an affidavit from Halpin in which she stated that until she met Cleveland, her [...] "life was pure and spotless", and [...] "there is not, and never was, a doubt as to the paternity of <b>our</b> <b>child,</b> and the attempt of Grover Cleveland, or his friends, to couple the name of Oscar Folsom, or any one else, with that boy, for that purpose is simply infamous and false." ...|$|E

[...] She also wrote that given who their parents are, [...] "that can only mean trouble". Fenmore has dated Summer, to which Ehrich stated: [...] "Everything he does is for his love for Summer. He has this obsession with her. Every action he does stems from that." [...] In another interview, he stated of their relationship: [...] "I think Fen’s first love is Summer; he falls in love; he’s infatuated with her. She plays games with him, and where it’s going is – will Fen get into her ways, or will he stand his ground? Everything Fenmore does is coming from his love for Summer, so he’s still the same kid, it’s just sometimes love makes you do some crazy thing Fenmore later began to enter a rebellious phase." [...] Tracey Bregman (who portrays his mother Lauren) stated that she [...] "was always hoping they would show the dark side of <b>our</b> <b>child,</b> because both Lauren and Michael have dark sides.

[...] Ehrich liked the plot as he was bullied as a child, stating: [...] "Kids do it out of their own sadness or insecurity, but needless to say that doesn’t matter when you’re a victim of it - you feel so isolated and so alone.

In April 2008, he stated in a Russian newspaper; [...] "Compared with Germany, England is far behind in terms of comfort and culture. Five out of the seven houses near us are occupied by footballers. Steven Gerrard was burgled recently so a police patrol car comes into our area fairly often. We hear police sirens all the time. Leverkusen by contrast was so much quieter.
