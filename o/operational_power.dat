25|$|At {{that time}} Deltics were {{generally}} run with only limited maintenance until they became unable to continue running and required rescue by other locomotives after breaking down. Typically the cause would be engine failure, although some Deltics were withdrawn for other reasons. Exchange of <b>operational</b> <b>power</b> units between withdrawn locomotives and running examples was regularly {{carried out at}} both Doncaster Works and at Stratford Works. Withdrawn locomotives were then taken to Doncaster Works for stripping and eventual scrapping. For a time the Deltic scrap line was a major draw for railway enthusiasts.|$|E
25|$|On 28 April 1939, Whittle made a {{visit to}} the {{premises}} of the Gloster Aircraft Company, where he met several key figures, such as George Carter, Gloster's chief designer. Carter took a keen interest in Whittle's project, particularly when he saw the <b>operational</b> <b>Power</b> Jets W.1 engine; Carter quickly made several rough proposals of various aircraft designs powered by the engine. Independently, Whittle had also been producing several proposals for a high-altitude jet-powered bomber; following the start of the Second World War and the Battle for France, a greater national emphasis on fighter aircraft arose. Power Jets and Gloster quickly formed a mutual understanding around mid-1939.|$|E

500|$|Wackett {{played a}} key role in {{establishing}} technical services as a distinct department within the RAAF, rather than forming part of the Supply Branch as in previous years. Mindful of the increasing responsibility that was being placed on scientific and technical resources in the modern Air Force, he had raised the question of a specialist engineering branch immediately after the war, and in March 1946 gained broad approval for its establishment. After eighteen months of work defining its scope and responsibilities, the Technical Branch was formed under Wackett's leadership on 23September 1948, his goals being [...] "to support the <b>operational</b> <b>power</b> of the RAAF by providing the most efficient technical organisation possible" [...] and [...] "to increase the effectiveness of air power through technical development". This in turn led to a separate [...] "list" [...] of engineering personnel, as opposed to the earlier Technical List subgroup under the General Duties Branch.|$|E

50|$|Rivalry {{with the}} armed {{services}} branch commands, mainly with the Oberkommando des Heeres (OKH), prevented the OKW from becoming a unified German General Staff in an effective chain of command.

During the war, the OKW, subordinate to Adolf Hitler as Supreme Commander of the Wehrmacht, acquired more and more <b>operational</b> <b>powers.</b> By 1942, OKW had responsibility for all theaters except for the Eastern Front against the Soviet Union. Hitler manipulated the bipolar system to keep ultimate decisions in his own hands.|$|R
