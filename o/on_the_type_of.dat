5|$|A {{wildfire}} or {{wildland fire}} is {{a fire in}} an area of combustible vegetation that occurs in the countryside or rural area. Depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> vegetation where it occurs, a wildfire can also be classified more specifically as a brush fire, bush fire, desert fire, forest fire, grass fire, hill fire, peat fire, vegetation fire, or veld fire. Fossil charcoal indicates that wildfires began soon after the appearance of terrestrial plants 420 million years ago. Wildfire’s occurrence throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems' flora and fauna.|$|E
5|$|Annealing is {{the process}} of heating the steel to a {{sufficiently}} high temperature to relieve local internal stresses. It does not create a general softening of the product but only locally relieves strains and stresses locked up within the material. Annealing goes through three phases: recovery, recrystallization, and grain growth. The temperature required to anneal a particular steel depends <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> annealing to be achieved and the alloying constituents.|$|E

Common treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. NSCLC is sometimes treated with surgery, whereas SCLC usually responds better to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.|$|E

A number of structures integra-ting active, hybrid, and semiactive response control technologies have been constructed in Japan. Most of them are building structures. This paper provides an overview of those building structures, focusing mainly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> buildings that are controlled, and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> control devices that are implemented. Future directions of structural engineering are also discussed. Copyright? 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
5|$|Carbon fiber {{is made by}} {{pyrolysis}} of extruded {{and stretched}} filaments of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and other organic substances. The crystallographic structure and mechanical properties of the fiber depend <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> starting material, and on the subsequent processing. Carbon fibers made from PAN have structure resembling narrow filaments of graphite, but thermal processing may re-order the structure into a continuous rolled sheet. The result is fibers with higher specific tensile strength than steel.|$|E
5|$|Cells cannot {{function}} if DNA damage corrupts {{the integrity}} and accessibility of essential information in the genome (but cells remain superficially functional when non-essential genes are missing or damaged). Depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> damage inflicted on the DNA's double helical structure, a variety of repair strategies have evolved to restore lost information. If possible, cells use the unmodified complementary strand of the DNA or the sister chromatid as a template to recover the original information. Without access to a template, cells use an error-prone recovery mechanism known as translesion synthesis as a last resort.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} varies {{during the}} lifespan of an individual. Researchers have more specifically described cognitive flexibility as {{the capacity to}} shift or switch one’s thinking and attention between different tasks or operations typically {{in response to a}} change in rules or demands. For example, when sorting cards based on specific rules, children are considered cognitively flexible if they are able to successfully switch from sorting cards based on the color of the object to sorting based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> object on the card.|$|E

In lung cancer, these phenomena may include hypercalcemia, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH, abnormally concentrated urine and diluted blood), ectopic ACTH production, or Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (muscle weakness due to autoantibodies). Tumors {{in the top of}} the lung, known as Pancoast tumors, may invade the local part of the sympathetic nervous system, leading to Horner's syndrome (dropping of the eyelid and a small pupil on that side), as well as damage to the brachial plexus.|$|E
5|$|Die casting is a {{metal casting}} {{process that is}} {{characterized}} by forcing molten metal under high pressure into a mold cavity. The mold cavity is created using two hardened tool steel dies which have been machined into shape and work similarly to an injection mold during the process. Most die castings are made from non-ferrous metals, specifically zinc, copper, aluminium, magnesium, lead, pewter and tin-based alloys. Depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> metal being cast, a hot- or cold-chamber machine is used.|$|E

Sufficient methodologies are available to retrieve data from volatile memory, however, there is lack of detailed methodology or a framework for data retrieval from non-volatile memory sources. Depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> devices, media or artifacts, digital forensics investigation is branched into various types.|$|E
