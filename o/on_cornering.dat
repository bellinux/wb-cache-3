40|$|We {{consider}} the high speed, weave and wobble mode, stability of a two-wheeled vehicle {{equipped with a}} passive gyroscopic stabiliser. This stabiliser is a rapidly-spinning disk attached to the chassis of the vehicle with freedom to rotate along an axis perpendicular to the spinning axis. The equations of motion of the combined system are derived symbolically using the multibody dynamics software MBSymba and linearised about the equilibrium condition of constant-speed forward motion in order to investigate stability properties at different vehicle speeds. Using this methodology, a stabiliser is designed that can improve the stability of both the wobble and weave modes of the vehicle. This contrasts with the more conventional use of a damper on the steering column, which can only correct wobble instability and is detrimental to weave mode stability.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted to evaluate cornering characteristics of the 32 x 8. 8 nose gear tire {{of the space shuttle}} orbiter. Data were obtained on a dry concrete runway at nominal ground speeds ranging from 50 to 100 knots and over a range of tire vertical loads and yaw angles which span the expected envelope of loads and yaw angles to be encountered during space shuttle landing operations. The cornering characteristics investigated included side and drag forces and friction coefficients, aligning and overturning torques, friction force moment arm, and the lateral center of pressure shift. Results of this investigation indicate that the cornering characteristics of the space shuttle nose gear tire are insensitive to variations in ground speed over the range tested. The effects <b>on</b> <b>cornering</b> characteristics of variations in the tire vertical load and yaw angle are as expected.

40|$|Abstract. Vehicle {{handling}} and control {{is an essential}} aspect of intelligent driver assistance systems, a building block of the upcoming generation of ”smart cars”. Acar’shandlingisaffectedby(i) technological (engine, suspension, brakes, tires, wheels, steering, etc.), (ii) environmental (road condition, weather, traffic, etc.), and (iii) human (attentiveness, reactiveness, driver agility, etc.) factors, and their mutual interrelationship. In this paper we investigate on how a driver’s endeavor for precise steering interferes with lateral acceleration while cornering. Depending on the steering ratio and the cruising speed, we identify that the readiness of a driver to compensate lateral forces exhibits counterintuitive characteristics. A driver body posture recognition technique based on a high resolution pressure sensor integrated invisibly and unobtrusively {{into the fabric of}} the driver seat has been developed. Sensor data, collected by two 32 x 32 pressure sensor arrays (seat- and backrest), is classified according to features defined based <b>on</b> <b>cornering</b> driving situations. Experimental results verify an increased readiness to compensate lateral acceleration with increasing driving speed, but only beyond a certain driver specific ”break even ” point. Above intelligent driver assistance, e. g. to improve steering precision, to reduce or avoid over-steer or under-steer, or to proactively notify electronic stability control (ESC), our results also encourage for new modalities in driver-to-car and car-to-roadside interaction...|$|E
40|$|Inflation {{pressure}} affects {{every aspect}} of tire performance. Most tire models, including the Radt/Milliken Nondimensional Tire Model, are restricted to modeling a single inflation pressure at a time. This is a reasonable limitation, in that the Nondimensional model forms an input/output relationship between tire operating conditions and force & moment outputs. Traditional operating conditions are normal load, slip angle, inclination angle, slip ratio and road surface friction coefficient. Tire pressure {{is more like a}} tire parameter than a tire operating condition. Since the Nondimensional Tire Model is semi-empirical it does not specifically deal with tire parameters like sidewall height or tread compound. Still, tire pressure is the easiest tire parameter to change, and as the air temperature within the tire varies during use so does the inflation pressure. Thus, it is desirable to incorporate inflation pressure into the Nondimensional Tire Model as an input. This paper discusses the effects of tire pressure on tire force and moment output. Effects on lateral force and aligning torque are investigated in detail. Additionally, the effects <b>on</b> <b>cornering</b> stiffness, friction coefficients, peak aligning torque coefficient and peak shape are reviewed. New techniques to implement pressure effects in the Nondimensional Model are presented. Applications of these techniques are shown on a Formula SAE tire and a full-size radial racing tire. Additionally, the effects of inflation pressure on tire spring rate and loaded radius are investigated. While these are not modeled using Nondimensional techniques, they are important variables accompanying any tire model...|$|E

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this work is to gain {{knowledge}} of how {{and to what extent}} state-of-the-artsimulation tools {{can be used in a}} conceptual development phase for vehicle dynamics control atVolvo Car Corporation (VCC). The first part of the thesis deals with an evaluation of vehicle dynamics simulation tools and theiruses. The three simulation tools selected for the study, namely Mechanical Simulation CarSim 8. 2. 1,IPG CarMaker 4. 0. 5, and VI-Grade CarRealTime V 14, are briefly described and discussed. In order toevaluate and compare these tools with respect to application for vehicle dynamics control, a criterialist is developed covering aspects such as tool requirements and intended usage. Based on thecriteria list and certain identified drawbacks, a ranking of the tools is made possible. Furthermore,the process of developing vehicle models for the different tools is discussed in detail, along with theprocedure of validating the vehicle models. In the second part, the concept of Collision Avoidance Driver Assistance (CADA) function isintroduced and possible approaches for developing CADA functions are discussed in brief. It isimportant to note that the CADA functions in this work are based <b>on</b> <b>cornering</b> the vehicle i. e. maneuvering around the threat, rather than solely reducing vehicle speed. A number ofimplementations of the functions are developed in Simulink. A frequency analysis of a simplifiedlinear vehicle model is performed to investigate the influence of steering, differential braking, andtheir combination on the resultant lateral displacement of the vehicle during an evasive maneuver. The developed CADA functions are then simulated using the vehicle simulation tools. Two specificmetrics - Lateral Displacement gain and DeltaX - are formulated to evaluate the effectiveness of theCADA functions. Based on these metrics, the assistance obtained due to the functions for a specificevasive maneuver is compared. From the evaluation process of the three tools, two were considered suitable for the purpose ofsimulating collision avoidance functions. The evaluation of the CADA functions demonstrates thatcombined assistive steering with differential braking provides considerable assistance in order toavoid collisions. The simulation results also present interesting trends which provide a usefuldirection regarding the conditions for intervention by such collision avoidance functions during anevasive maneuver. The use of simulation tools makes it possible to observe these trends and utilizethem in the development process of the functions...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of temperature on tire performance is subject of matter in Research for many years. It {{is well known}} that the temperature affects the grip level of the tire and the cornering stiffness at the same time. Anyway, while the {{influence of}} temperature on grip level has been deeply investigated in different activities, the influence <b>on</b> <b>cornering</b> stiffness seems to be not sufficiently discussed yet. As shown in this work, the reason could be that the cornering stiffness is not influenced by the surface temperature – i. e. the temperature that can be measured on the tread surface – but instead by the bulk temperature – i. e. the core of the tire that means everything is between tread surface and inner liner. Again, different mathematical models, more or less complex, have been developed to simulate the tire performance during the last 20 years. Anyway, one limit of all these models is that they do not consider the influence of temperature. The purpose of the entire activity has been deeply investigating the influence of the bulk temperature on tire cornering stiffness also implementing a thermal model able to estimate this temperature correcting the cornering stiffness in consequence. Indoor and outdoor tests have been conducted for the purpose. In particular the activity was focused on the linear range of the tire lateral characteristic (slip angle limited to +- 1 °). The indoor test campaign has been performed on the Flat Trac machine using a tire equipped with particular sensors developed by the TUV Automotive and named T 3 M sensors. These sensors consist of thermo resistances temperature sensitive that can be introduced in the bulk of a tire. Different procedures to evaluate the cornering stiffness have been performed. The results have been surprising in terms of the temperature reached during the test. The procedures gave back significant difference on bulk temperature involving in considerable different cornering stiffness characteristics. The outdoor tests have been conducted on the oval track of the Bridgestone European Proving Ground, remaining in the linear range of the characteristic. Also in this case the results have been surprising for some aspects: the tires reached very high bulk temperatures saturating at a value that depends on vertical load (that means the loads on the corners) and on angular velocity (that means the roadway speed). Furthermore the test showed a deep difference between inside and outside shoulder of the tire. This is in line with the negative camber angle influence that loads the inside shoulder more than the outside. A thermal model has been developed to evaluate the bulk temperature of a tire during its exercise and correcting the cornering stiffness – through Pacejka formulation – taking into account the influence of the temperature itself. The model is physical, the thickness of the tire is divided into two layers: for both the equations of thermal diffusivity have been written in Matlab/Simulink environment. A physical model has been implemented even to evaluate the Strain Energy Loss (SEL) – i. e. the energy dissipated by hysteresis. The SEL model is based on different simplifying assumptions that did not influence the results anyway. All the parameters are easily measurable and the model needed no tuning. In fact even if a certain numbers of scaling factors have been introduced, all of them have been set to 1; few corrections have been needed in the SEL model; anyway always close to unit (0. 95 - 1. 1 the maximum variations). The model has been validated comparing the simulations with the indoor measurements and it appeared very satisfactory. The SEL model in particular gives back great results, taking into account in the right way as the influence of the vertical load as the influence of the roadway speed; this has been confirmed for very different tire specifications (different sizes, different compounds and different constructions) ...|$|E
