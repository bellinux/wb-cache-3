2500|$|Thérèse's {{final years}} {{were marked by}} a steady decline that she bore resolutely and without complaint. Tuberculosis was the key element of Thérèse's final suffering, but she saw {{that as part of}} her spiritual journey. After observing a {{rigorous}} Lenten fast in 1896, she went to bed on the eve of Good Friday and felt a joyous sensation. She wrote: [...] "Oh! how sweet this memory really is! ... I had scarcely laid my head upon the pillow when I felt something like a bubbling stream mounting to my lips. I didn't know what it was." [...] The next morning her handkerchief was soaked in blood and she understood her fate. Coughing up of blood meant tuberculosis, and tuberculosis meant death. She wrote, [...] "I thought immediately of the joyful thing that I had to learn, so I went <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> I was able to see that I was not mistaken. Ah! my soul was filled with a great consolation; I was interiorly persuaded that Jesus, on the anniversary of His own death, wanted to have me hear His first call!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Other songs express emotions, such as [...] "Come On Write Me", which expresses vulnerability, {{something}} Van Peebles {{later said}} was absent from modern recordings by African American males. Van Peebles wrote [...] "Eyes On The Rabbit" [...] as a joke, {{inspired by the}} piano player's wife, who he described as [...] "sappy". Van Peebles said, [...] "I'm going to write the sappiest song I can." [...] Van Peebles rehearsed the song at the piano player's house, where the saxophonist and his wife, and the pianist and his wife stayed inside and watched Van Peebles playing the song outside. Van Peebles walked <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and saw {{that none of them}} laughed at the song. He initially thought they didn't want to laugh at him, but realized that all of them were crying, and the song had a different emotional impact than he had intended. One of the watchers congratulated Van Peebles on the song, but Van Peebles explained that the song was a joke, angering him and his girlfriend, who wanted to beat Van Peebles up. Van Peebles backed off by claiming that the song wasn't a joke.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1976, Herzog visited Plainfield again, this time to shoot part of his film Stroszek. After the {{shooting}} finished, Herzog handed Morris an envelope with cash in it.

50|$|All the Class 11E {{locomotives}} {{were delivered}} in the SAR red oxide livery with signal red buffer beams and cowcatchers, with yellow whiskers on <b>the</b> ends folded <b>over</b> <b>to</b> below <b>the</b> side <b>windows</b> and with <b>the</b> number plates on the sides mounted on three-stripe yellow wings. In the late 1990s all were repainted in the Spoornet blue livery with either solid or outline numbers on the long hood sides.|$|R
50|$|For such contingency, a more {{innovative}} though highly complex approach for <b>the</b> developer is <b>to</b> have a trimmed down {{version of the}} POS system installed on the cashier computer at the outlet. On a daily basis the latest inventory and membership information from the remote server is automatically updated into the local database. Thus should the remote server fail, the cashier can switch <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> local sale <b>window</b> without disrupting sales. When the remote server is restored and <b>the</b> cashier switches <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cloud system, the locally processed sale records are then automatically submitted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> remote system, thus maintaining {{the integrity of the}} remote database.|$|R

50|$|In 1910, the Methodists hired a New York {{fundraising}} firm {{to raise}} funds for a new, larger church <b>to</b> replace <b>the</b> 1883 building. The growing congregation raised $14,000 and neighbor C. J. Wagenbreth donated <b>the</b> needed capital <b>to</b> complete <b>the</b> project, providing that no bell be hung in the belfry. Wagenbreth, not wanting to be awoken by bells, offered this deal, a steeple but no bells. Designed by the architectural firm of Woodruff & McGulpin in 1912, the Methodist Church stands as a visual reminder of the growth of Miles City and is an important neighborhood anchor. The building exhibits eclectic architectural influences, including Romanesque Revival windows, crenellated Gothic battlements, and early Christian or Tudor massing. Decorative round-arched Romanesque openings complement the bell tower and <b>the</b> design carries <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> main level <b>windows.</b> Each opening is highlighted with painted wood mullions and cusps that form a pair of arches with circular openings surrounded by brick. The only structure in Miles City designed by the firm, the design bears similarities to Brynjulf Rivenes’ Presbyterian Church on Main Street.|$|R
50|$|Michael, Madam Yeung, and a Hong Kong {{police officer}} ride with Luk toward the Hong Kong police {{station in the}} back of an ambulance. Madam Yeung interrogates Luk, who tells her that a Seattle police officer {{attacked}} him in the station. Michael tries to convince Luk to let him extradite him back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Just then a large blue truck pulls up alongside them, and two thugs, one of them played by John Salvitti, jump from it onto the roof of the ambulance. Salvitti swings around and kicks through <b>the</b> driver's <b>window,</b> knocking out <b>the</b> driver and taking his place. The other thug throws a gas bomb through <b>the</b> <b>window</b> into <b>the</b> back. The gas knocks out Michael, Luk, and the Hong Kong police officer, but Madam Yeung grabs the ambulance's inhaler and uses it <b>to</b> avoid <b>the</b> gas until the thug breaks in through the rear doors. She kicks him out, and he climbs back onto the roof. She climbs up after him, and they fight {{on the roof of the}} speeding ambulance. He kicks her off, but she does a 720 degree backflip, kicks through <b>the</b> side <b>windows,</b> and hangs upside down by her feet, her head almost striking the road. She struggles to get back up, but he kicks her down again, and she clings <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ambulance, her dragging feet almost getting sucked under the rear wheels. He climbs down and kicks her repeatedly, but she manages to pull herself up and kick him away, then climb <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> broken driver's <b>window</b> and attack Salvitti. Salvitti draws a gun and opens fire at her, and she ends up falling off the front of the ambulance and clinging <b>to</b> <b>the</b> grill, her feet dragging on the road underneath the ambulance. Salvitti speeds forward and attempts to crush her between the ambulance and the rear of the blue truck, but she manages to climb free enough to throw herself out of the way and roll out on the road behind the vehicles as they escape with Luk and Michael as captives.|$|R

30|$|Here, {{we explain}} {{an example of}} windows update case. As a prerequisite, cygwin module is {{installed}} on a windows virtual machine and patches are stored in a server which can be accessed from a windows virtual machine.

AVFs apply these patches <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> virtual machine by wusa (Windows Update StandAlone) command. AVFs confirm validity of patches application by event logs through powershell Get-WinEvent command. Finally, AVFs reboot <b>the</b> <b>Windows</b> vitual machine by shutdown command.|$|R
