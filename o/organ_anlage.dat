40|$|AbstractNeurons {{differentiating}} {{into the}} luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) neuroendocrine phenotype {{are derived from}} the nasal placode. Cells within the vomeronasal <b>organ</b> <b>anlage</b> that turn on LHRH gene and peptide expression subsequently migrate into the forebrain where they influence reproductive function. The molecular and cellular cues regulating differentiation and migration of these cells are unknown. Discovery of developmental markers can indicate proteins directing or associated with differentiation. Analysis of such markers after manipulation of external cues can elucidate important extracellular differentiation signals. Embryonic LHRH neurons were examined in vivo for Mash- 1 and nestin, two factors that delineate precursor populations in PNS and forebrain CNS cells. Nestin, but not Mash- 1, was detected in early expressing LHRH cells in the vomeronasal <b>organ</b> <b>anlage.</b> These results were duplicated in LHRH neurons maintained in vitro in nasal explants. Such LHRH cells expressed nestin mRNA but not Mash- 1 mRNA and were also negative for three other olfactory epithelial developmental transcription factors, Math 4 A, Math 4 C/neurogenin 1, and NeuroD mRNA. Experimental manipulation of nasal explants revealed dual expression of nestin protein and LHRH in cells proximal to the vomeronasal <b>organ</b> <b>anlage</b> that was dependent upon midline cartilaginous/mesenchymal tissues. Prolonged nestin expression in LHRH cells after midline removal is consistent with nasal midline tissues modulating differentiation of LHRH neurons from the nasal placode...|$|E
40|$|Branching {{morphogenesis}} {{involves the}} restructuring of epithelial tissues into complex and organized ramified tubular networks. Early rounds of branching are controlled genetically in a hardwired fashion in many organs, whereas later, branching is stochastic, responding to environmental cues. We discuss this sequential process from formation of an <b>organ</b> <b>anlage</b> and invagination of the epithelium to branch initiation and outgrowth in several model systems including Drosophila trachea and mammalian lung, mammary gland, and kidney...|$|E
30|$|Growth factors or more {{precisely}} morphogens are highly bioactive molecules, which control stem cells within the nephrogenic zone and individual niches during development of the kidney [65]. This complex task comprises regulation of stemness, cell proliferation, targeted migration, competence, induction, and primary formation of nephrons [9]. In a human kidney, this process is active {{from the beginning of}} <b>organ</b> <b>anlage</b> up to birth, while in other mammalian species, nephrogenesis can proceed during the early postnatal period [7].|$|E
40|$|Expression of EMILIN- 1, {{the first}} {{member of a}} newly {{discovered}} family of extracellular matrix genes, has been investigated during mouse development. EMILIN- 1 mRNA is detectable in morula and blastocyst by RT-PCR. First expression of the gene is found by in situ hybridization in ectoplacental cone in embryos of 6. 5 days and in extraembryonic visceral endoderm at 7. 5 days. The allantois is also labeled. Staining of ectoplacental cone-derived secondary trophoblast giant cells and spongiotrophoblast is strong up to 11. 5 days and then declines. In the embryo, high levels of mRNA are initially expressed in blood vessels, perineural mesenchyme and somites at 8. 5 days. Later on, intense labeling is identified in the mesenchymal component of <b>organs</b> <b>anlage</b> (i. e. lung and liver) and different mesenchymal condensations (i. e. limb bud and branchial arches). At late gestation staining is widely distributed in interstitial connective tissue and smooth muscle cell-rich tissues. The data suggest that EMILIN- 1 may have a function in placenta formation and initial organogenesis and a later role in interstitial connective tissue...|$|R
40|$|External {{genitalia}} are anatomical structures {{located at}} the posterior embryonic region as part of several urogenital/reproductive <b>organs.</b> The embryonic <b>anlage</b> of the external genitalia, the genital tubercle (GT) develops as a bud-shaped structure with an initial urethral plate and later urethra. Embryonic external genitalia {{are considered to be}} one of the appendages. Recent experiments suggest that essential regulatory genes possess similar functions for the outgrowth regulation of the GT and limb appendages. The transient embryonic epithelia located in the distal GT are called the distal urethral epithelium (DUE) regulating, at least in part, the (distal) GT development. This review covers the available data about early patterning of GT and discusses the molecular developmental similarities and points of divergence between the different appendages. Development of the male and female external genitalia is also reviewed. Developmental Dynamic...|$|R
40|$|There {{is still}} not an {{appealing}} and testable model to explain how single-celled organisms, usually following fusion {{of male and female}} gametes, proceed to grow and evolve into multi-cellular, complexly differentiated systems, a particular species following virtually an invariant and unique growth pattern. An intrinsic electrical oscillator, resembling the cardiac pacemaker, may explain the process. Highly auto-correlated, it could live independently of ordinary thermodynamic processes which mandate increasing disorder, and could coordinate growth and differentiation of <b>organ</b> <b>anlage...</b>|$|E
40|$|Thymopoiesis is {{a complex}} and highly dynamic process. It {{involves}} reciprocal tissue interactions between epithelial cells derived from the endoderm of the anterior foregut and neural crest-derived mesenchyme to form the thymic rudiment. This <b>organ</b> <b>anlage</b> attracts thymocyte progenitors and supports their differentiation and functional maturation into a self-tolerant diverse repertoire of T cells. In recent years, a more detailed picture of the molecular mechanisms determining {{the formation of the}} thymic rudiment and those controlling the maturation of the epithelial compartment has emerged and these are briefly summarized here. This review also addresses new experimental approaches toward a better understanding of thymopoiesis and discusses the impact of new animal models...|$|E
40|$|Alterations which {{occur during}} {{differentiation}} {{in the fine}} structure of the cement gland of the embryo of Xenopus laevis have been investigated. The <b>organ</b> <b>anlage</b> at the late neurula stage is composed of cuboidal cells of comparatively simple cytoplasmic structure. Coincident with the subsequent cellular elongation there is a formation of extensive arrays of functionally inter-related membrane systems, leading {{to the production of}} a mucin-like secretory substance. Although there is no direct structural continuity between the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, small vesicles which seem to originate from areas of agranular reticulum appear to transport material synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi zone. Further elaboration of the product {{at the site of the}} Golgi material is suggested by the progressive increase in the quantity of the contents as the cisternae enlarge to form secretory granules. Other notable features of the differentiating cells are microtubules and cytoplasmic filaments, many of which are oriented in the direction of cellular elongation. In suitably preserved specimens, large numbers of glycogen granules are present. The degenerating gland is charac-terized by the appearance of large autolytic vacuoles within the cytoplasm. Traces of the membrane systems are present and, in many cells, there remain large numbers of secretory granules...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of lymphoid organs depends on cross talk between hematopoietic cells and mesenchymal stromal cells and on vascularization of the lymphoid primordia. These processes are orchestrated by cytokines, chemokines, and angiogenic factors that require tight spatiotemporal regulation. Heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans are molecules designed to specifically bind and regulate the bioactivity of soluble protein ligands. Their binding capacity and specificity {{are controlled by}} modification of the HS side chain by HS-modifying enzymes. Although HS proteoglycans have been implicated in the morphogenesis of several organ systems, their role in controlling lymphoid organ development has thus far remained unexplored. In this study, we report that modification of HS by the HS-modifying enzyme glucuronyl C 5 -epimerase (GIce), which controls HS chain flexibility, is required for proper lymphoid organ development. Glce(- 1 -) mice show a strongly reduced size of the fetal spleen {{as well as a}} spectrum of defects in thymus and lymph node development, ranging from dislocation to complete absence of the <b>organ</b> <b>anlage.</b> Once established, however, the Glce(-/-) primordia recruited lymphocytes and developed normal architectural features. Furthermore, Glce(-/-) lymph node anlagen transplanted into wild-type recipient mice allowed undisturbed lymphocyte maturation. Our results indicate that modification of HS by Glce is required for controlling the activity of molecules that are instructive for early lymphoid tissue morphogenesis but may be dispensable at later developmental stages and for lymphocyte maturation and differentiation.

40|$|AbstractThe genetic steps {{governing}} {{development of}} the spleen are largely unknown. Absence of Hox 11 in mice results in asplenia, but {{it is unclear how}} Hox 11 exerts its effect on spleen development. To more precisely define Hox 11 's role in spleen morphogenesis, we have examined the fate of the developing spleen in Hox 11 −/− mice. Perturbation of spleen development begins between dE 13 and dE 13. 5. Cells of the spleen anlage persist past this developmental stage as an unorganized rudiment between the stomach and the pancreas. They fail to proliferate, and haematopoietic cells do not colonize the rudiment. At later stages of embryonic development, the cells can be observed in the mesenchyme of the pancreas, also an expression site of Hox 11. In Hox 11 −/−↔+/+ chimaeras, spleens were devoid of Hox 11 −/− cells, indicating that the genetic defect is cell autonomous and not due to failure of the <b>organ</b> <b>anlage</b> to attract and retain haematopoietic cells. In −/−↔+/+ chimaeric embryos, Hox 11 −/− cells were initially present in the spleen anlage. However, at dE 13, a reorganization of the spleen occurred in the chimaeras and Hox 11 −/− cells were subsequently excluded from the spleen, suggesting that a change in the affinity for one of the spleen cells had occurred. These observations demonstrate that spleen development consists of genetically separable steps and that absence of Hox 11 arrests spleen development at an early stage. The formation of the spleen primordium before the entry of haematopoietic cells does not require the activity of Hox 11. However, subsequent differentiation of spleen precursor cells is dependent on the Hox 11 gene...|$|E
