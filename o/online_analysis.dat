25|$|An NMR {{spectrometer}} typically {{consists of}} a spinning sample-holder inside a very strong magnet, a radio-frequency emitter and a receiver with a probe (an antenna assembly) that goes inside the magnet to surround the sample, optionally gradient coils for diffusion measurements and electronics to control the system. Spinning the sample is necessary to average out diffusional motion. Whereas, measurements of diffusion constants (diffusion ordered spectroscopy or DOSY) are done the sample stationary and spinning off, and flow cells {{can be used for}} <b>online</b> <b>analysis</b> of process flows.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{findings}} of a study that compared models of <b>online</b> source <b>analysis.</b> It is argued that there is disconnect between print-based (classical) approaches to teaching <b>online</b> source <b>analysis</b> in history, and how students are informally analysing online information. It will be argued that this disconnect makes it difficult for students to effectively analyse online sources containing false and misleading information. In order to address this issue, formal web-based approaches to <b>online</b> source <b>analysis</b> need to be developed and evaluated. The paper puts forward Shane Borrowman's (1999) application of the Aristotle's concept of Ethos as a framework through which <b>online</b> source <b>analysis</b> can be formalised, and student critical awareness can be activated. The study was conducted with Australian senior high school students, who evaluated Holocaust denial websites before and after an intervention. The responses in each case were compared, and it was found that formalising students’ web-based models of analysis significantly increased the depth and criticality of their engagement. This paper contributes to the debate on how to most effectively activate student critical awareness when analysing online historical sources...|$|R
