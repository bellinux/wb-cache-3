Among many aspects in friendships, we mainly focused on the {{positive}} aspects, that is, on the concepts of social supports. Based on the findings from <b>our</b> <b>researches,</b> we discuss the following points of frienships; the actual state of friendships, the comparison with parent-child relationship or teacher-student relationship, and the difference in friendship beliefs between students, parents and teachers. In case of the serious problems of friendships, it is necessary for parents and teachers to intervene the problems directly. However, <b>our</b> <b>researches</b> suggest that, in normal situations, it is also important for parents and teachers to give regard to the students'growth among friends, and to give effects to the friendships indirectly...|$|R

Thirdly, <b>our</b> <b>researches</b> on baseline removal, monitoring of the pulse and the feature extraction of the pulse are introduced. Furthermore, our pulse acquisition diagnosis system is presented. Finally, the prosperities and future works are also pointed out...|$|R

This same paper acknowledged that the termination decision had seriously delayed the advancement of aeronautical progress by Britain. It has since been widely recognised that the cancellation of the M.52 was a major setback in British progress in the field of supersonic design.|$|E

[...] According to the CRI, the group's beliefs about Christian demon possession and [...] "Oneness" [...] constituted heresy.

To elucidate the unresolved issues of each theme, we have been investigating by using embryological, molecular biological, and pathological methods. In the near future, we hope that our approaches will lead to the development of new effective medicines and treatments for intractable liver diseases and of an artificial liver device in which the reconstructed hepatic tissues are incorporated...|$|R
