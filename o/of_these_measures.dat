Regardless <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>measures,</b> a Dravida Nadu Separation Day was {{observed}} on 17 September 1960 resulting in numerous arrests. However, Periyar resumed his campaign in 1968. He wrote an editorial on 'Tamil Nadu for Tamilians' in which he stated, that by nationalism only Brahmins had prospered and nationalism had been developed to abolish the rights of Tamils. He advocated that there was need to establish a Tamil Nadu Freedom Organization {{and that it was}} necessary to work towards it.|$|E
5|$|In circa 1250 BC, {{the first}} wave of {{destruction}} has been witnessed in various centers of mainland Greece for reasons that cannot be identified by archaeologists. These incidents appear to have triggered the massive strengthening and expansion of the fortifications in various sites. In some cases, arrangements were also made for the creation of subterranean passages which led to underground cisterns. Nevertheless, none <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>measures</b> appear to have prevented the final destruction of the Mycenaean palace centers in the 12th century BC. The reasons that lead to the collapse of the Mycenaean culture have been hotly debated among scholars. The two most common theories are population movement and internal conflict.|$|E
5|$|On 22 April, Abu Nuwar {{issued a}} radio {{statement}} from the Cairo-based Voice of the Arabs radio station denouncing Hussein. In coordination with Abu Nuwar, the following day, a Patriotic Congress composed of Hussein's opposition was held in Nablus in the West Bank demanding major palace officials be dismissed, expulsion of the American ambassador and military attaché, rejection of the Eisenhower Doctrine, federal unity with Egypt and Syria and reinstatement of the dismissed army officers, including Abu Nuwar. As {{a result of the}} congress, Hussein put Nablus, Jerusalem and Amman under military curfew, dissolved political parties, imposed press censorship, dismissed municipal councils in the West Bank in favor of military governors, disbanded Palestinian-dominated army units, arrested al-Nabulsi (who had since been made foreign minister) and dismissed the cabinet of Prime Minister Fakhri al-Khalidi. Although he eventually relaxed some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>measures,</b> namely military curfews and severe press censorship, Hussein's moves significantly curtailed the constitutional democracy that existed in Jordan in the mid-1950s.|$|E

5|$|On March 21, 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court {{handed down}} its ruling {{in the case}} of Dunn v. Blumstein that found that a citizen who had lived in a state for 30 days was {{resident}} in that state and thus eligible to vote there. Kentucky's Constitution required residency of one year in the state, six months in the county and sixty days in the precinct to establish voting eligibility. This issue had to be resolved before the 1972 presidential election in November, so Ford called a special legislative session to enact the necessary corrections. In addition, Ford added to the General Assembly's agenda the creation of a state environmental protection agency, a refinement of congressional districts in line with the latest census figures and ratification of the recently passed Equal Rights Amendment.

5|$|The Ottoman {{imperial}} government adopted its Tanzimat modernization {{reforms in}} 1862 and originally entrusted Aqil with enforcing {{the new law}} of the land in northern Palestine. Part <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>measures</b> were stronger efforts to suppress the Bedouin tribes and decisively end their raiding activities. Aqil was given orders to prevent them from setting up camps in the cultivated lands of Galilee and forbade the collection of khuwwa tolls from the local inhabitants. Aqil resigned from his post when he was informed that as part of his new assignment he and his men were required to don Ottoman uniforms. He objected to the requirement, insisting that as Bedouin, they were not accustomed to wearing uniforms. He was replaced by one of his Hawwara tribesmen, but Aqil compelled his successor to resign as well. Shortly after his resignation, the requirement of uniforms was canceled and Aqil resumed his assignment.|$|E
5|$|When {{designing}} Queen Mary 2, {{the designers}} aimed {{to reduce the}} ship's {{impact on the environment}} by improving fuel efficiency and through better management of waste, not only to reduce fuel costs, but also to increase the service life of the ship, as it was predicted that tighter environmental regulations would be implemented while the ship was in service. Initial targets included the reuse of treated wastewater for non-potable uses and zero discharge of solid waste into the sea. For economic and other reasons, as well as to reduce energy consumption from incineration, some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>measures</b> were not implemented. Queen Mary 2s environmental performance nevertheless is an improvement from that of many older ships, as well as international standards on waste.|$|E

The cost <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>measures,</b> most of which were announced in the November 2008 Pre-Budget Report, was about £20billion excluding counting loan guarantees.
