5000|$|... (Per Davis, 1899): The hair of William Grevel {{is short}} and removed from the temples {{like that of the}} reeve {{described}} by Chaucer in his Canterbury Tales. At this period the young men were clean shaven, their elders wore a moustache and beard. Chaucer describes [...] "A marchant was there with a forked beard", and this fashion was duly followed by William Grevel. He wears a tight-fitting tunic reaching to the ankles; from the waist it is fastened by buttons, of which three are visible above the girdle and eleven beneath it. The sleeves of this tunic are close-fitting, and from beneath them emerge the tighter sleeves of an under-dress with seven buttons showing on each wrist. The tunic is confined at the waist by a girdle made of leather profusely adorned, and passing through an <b>oval</b> <b>buckle,</b> the end is passed under the girdle hanging down in front, and terminated by a metal pendant, on which is engraved a rosette. On his left side is the anelace, or basilard, which is suspended from the girdle by a thong. The anelace is broad in the blade, sharpened on both sides and tapered from hilt to point. The scabbard is ornamented with little pateras at the top and middle. Over all is a mantle, fastened by three large buttons on the right shoulder, and, gathered over the left arm, hangs gracefully. Round his neck he wears a hood of which the buttons are not shown. The shoes are pointed and fastened across the instep by a plain buckle. The background of the feet is plain.|$|E
50|$|The main {{element in}} the Mordvinian costume was a white canvas shirt, {{decorated}} with embroidery. Erzya shirt is made from two cloths, which beaned in two. In the middle, at the central suture there was a seam left to slit for the collar and the slit on the hem for a step. In the side seams on the top at right angle there were sewed sleeves. Traditional chest fastener in the Erzya costume was «fibula syulgamo». It was an <b>oval</b> <b>buckle</b> made of thick wire with a movable pin which was used for chipping the collar. Rich lower part covered a deep chest slit. In the 19th century, the collar was usually fastened by two fibulas, one of which had no decoration.Complex belt elements played a particular importance in Mordovian women`s costumes.Costume was loincloth- pulay, which was worn over a shirt. As a sign of pubescence, girls begin to wear a pulay since 13-14 years old and then it remained the woman`s costume accessory until her death. Mordvinian woman could not appear in men society without a «pulay». Depending on the place of existence, it had a different form: square, trapeziform or as a belt with magnificent fringe.Holiday « pulay» was decorated with shells, chains, copper buttons, badges, colored beads and along the edge with long, black, red, green or blue wool and with tassels on each side. As a result, the weight of such a «pulaya» was up to 6 kilograms. Waist decoration «pulay» was of two types. The {{right side of the}} cloth was decorated with embroidery. Then, almost to knees there was a fringe from the wool, usually of black, but on holidays it could be of red or green wool. Wool decorated with copper chains and on each side attached tassels of beads.Typical thing for Erzya costume was a canvas over clothes- “rutsya”. It was the clothing accessory of married women and had options for different situations in life and ritual. Over the shirt or rutsya they wore an apron - « ikelga patsya». It was tied low on the abdomen to close the hem of her shirt. In the complex adornments, which included several tiers of necklaces, especially distinguished original round collars on a firm basis covered with a canvas embroidered with rows of beads, buttons and chains. All of them perfectly matched with massive embroidery “rutsi”.The quality of clothing was defined by the type of embroidery. Spruce Erzya shirt was embroidered all along longitudinal stripes. Erzya embroidery was characterized by a beautiful carpet texture, borders and planes distinguished high relief. Although the ornament was pretty simple: rhombus, crosses and polylines. Decorating clothes women choose the best patterns - «sermat». In the old days they were the symbols of family belonging. Erzya woman naturally endowed with a sense of proportion. Intuitively, without the knowledge of designing and modeling clothes, she sewed a masterpiece. Red and black vertical stripes on a white canvas looked noble. A wide belt, «pulay» with long black strands emphasized hips and women looked slimmer. Removable adornments -were an obligatory addition to the clothes. This is a necklace with different lengths and materials, beaded collars, fibula-syulgamo, badges and bells.|$|E

40|$|Abstract-This study {{examined}} parameters under which risk compensation in driving can occur following {{the use of}} safety belts. Risk compensation theories hypothesize that if individuals use safety belts, they will drive in a more risky manner than {{if they do not}} use safety belts due to an increased perception of safety. Although the existence of risk compensation in driving has been debated in the literature for many years, the current study was the first experimental analysis of this theory that permitted a controlled examination of both between-subject and within-subject effects. This study required subjects to drive a 5 -hp. go-kart around an <b>oval</b> track either <b>buckled</b> or unbuckled in the first of two phases of 15 driving trials. After the first phase the safety condition was switched for half the subjects (i. e., the safety belt was removed from subjects using it or was used by subjects who previously did not use it). Dependent measures included latency for each Iap, deviations from the prescribed lane, and perceived safety white driving. The amount of time it took for subjects to travel to the go-kart track and their safety belt use during that trip was also measured.

After the first phase the safety condition was switched for half the subjects (i. e., the safety belt was removed from subjects using it or was used by subjects who previously did not use it). Dependent measures included latency for each lap, deviations from the prescribed lane, and perceived safety while driving. The amount of time it took for subjects to travel to the go-kart track and their safety belt use during that trip was also measured. Risk compensation theory was not supported in the between-subject analyses of the research data; however, some within-subject comparisons did demonstrate risk compensation. Subjects who switched from not using the safety belt to using it increased driving speed during the second phase significantly more than subjects who used the safety belt during both driving phases. The study suggested that the occurence of risk compensation is dependent upon individuals being able to compare the sensations using a safety belt with those of not using a safety belt. Risk compensation did not manifest itself in between-subject studies because this comparison could not take place. The implications of this study to driving automobiles on multi-user roadways is discussed. Suggestions for research to further expand the knowledge about how and when risk compensation occurs are also provided...|$|R

Obavljena su zaštitna istraživanja s vanjske strane temelja ranogotičke crkve koju su podignuli templari a istražena su i dva rova istočno i zapadno od crkve i prostor sakristije. Osim nekih zanimljivih arhitektonskih elemenata iz različitih razdoblja – od romaničke apside do novovjekih dogradnji, istražena su i 424 groba. Okvirno se mogu datirati u novovjekovno razdoblje, tj. u vrijeme nakon izgradnje te neposredno prije izgradnje sakristije (mlađa faza), zatim u vrijeme trajanja gotičke faze crkve (srednja faza) te, konačno, u vrijeme prije izgradnje gotičke crkve, odnosno za vrijeme ukopavanja oko romaničke crkve (najstarija faza ukopavanja). Veliku su pažnju na sebe privukli pronađeni pokretni nalazi iz svih faza ukopavanja, no najzanimljiviji su oni koje su iza sebe ostavili viteški redovi – templari i ivanovci. During {{the period}} from 2008 until 2011 the Institute of Archaeology, {{for the sake of}} {{complete}} restoration, undertook the archaeological research of the church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Gora near Petrinja. The rescue excavations were carried out on the front side of the foundations of the early Gothic church that was erected by the Templars. Two trenches on the eastern and on the western side of the church were investigated as well as the area of the sacristy. Besides the interesting architectural elements from different times - from the Romanesque apse to the Modern Age extensions, 424 graves which can be roughly dated to the Modern Ages (younger stage), the Gothic phase of the church (middle stage) and, finally, to the time before the construction of a Gothic church, that is, to the time of burying around a Romanesque church (the oldest phase of burials), were investigated. The finds from all phases of burials deserve special attention, but the most interesting are those left behind by the military orders - the Templars and Hospitallers. To the period of Hospitallers we can attribute, for example, two exemplars of silver denar of Hungaro-Croatian king Louis I, silver signet ring with a motif of lily, and two <b>oval</b> single-piece cast <b>buckles</b> with one pin found on the hips of one decedent. The Templars also left behind few exemplars of money, for example picolo, i. e. “Scyphate” denar of some Venetian Doge (Enrico Dandolo?) and silver Slavonian banovac probably of King Ladislaus IV Kumanac. There are also different pewter rings and a bronze buckle with “a series of beads” (German Perlstab) on the outer bar. Two findings particularly stand out - carved bone buckle in the form of two lions facing each other, with their paws joined, and an oval brooch with engraved inscription written in the beneventan script : AVeMAInLNROAICS. This inscription can be subdivided into two parts, with the AVE MA being an abbreviation of Ave Maria, and the InLNROAICS an invocation for: In Laude Nostri Register Omnipotent Altissimi Salvatori Jesui Christi (“In Praise of our King All-powerful Almighty Jesus Christ the Saviour”) ...|$|R
