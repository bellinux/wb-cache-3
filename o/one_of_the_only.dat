5|$|As {{the city}} grew, the hotels {{reflected}} ambitions {{of the strong}} economy, {{as evidenced by the}} eleven-story skyscraper Lamar Hotel built in 1927. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, the Lamar Hotel was adapted for use as a county annex building. In 1988 it was listed as a Mississippi Landmark. The E.F. Young Hotel was built in 1931. A staple in the African-American business district that developed west of the city's core, the hotel was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> places in the city during the years of segregation where a traveling African American could find a room.|$|E

5|$|Climate {{research}} on live coral species {{is limited to}} a few studied species. Studying Porites coral provides a stable foundation for geochemical interpretations that is much simpler to physically extract data in comparison to Platygyra species where the complexity of Platygyra species skeletal structure creates difficulty when physically sampled, which happens to be <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> multidecadal living coral records used for coral paleoclimate modeling.|$|E
5|$|During Franklin's administration, Eleanor {{became an}} {{important}} connection to the African-American population {{in the era of}} segregation. Despite the President's desire to placate Southern sentiment, Eleanor was vocal in her support of the civil rights movement. After her experience with Arthurdale and her inspections of New Deal programs in Southern states, she concluded that New Deal programs were discriminating against African-Americans, who received a disproportionately small share of relief moneys. Eleanor became <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> voices in the Roosevelt White House insisting that benefits be equally extended to Americans of all races.|$|E

Like most cycling Grand Tours do, the beginning of the 2009 Giro included a string of flat stages that were contested by sprinters. These stages were contested by Alessandro Petacchi and Mark Cavendish, among others, with Petacchi in victory becoming <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> riders to defeat Cavendish in a sprint in the 2009 season.|$|E

5|$|The black dragonfish (also {{called the}} {{northern}} stoplight loosejaw) Malacosteus niger {{is believed to}} be <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> fish to produce a red glow. Its eyes, however, are insensitive to this wavelength; it has an additional retinal pigment which fluoresces blue-green when illuminated. This alerts the fish to the presence of its prey. The additional pigment is thought to be assimilated from chlorophyll derivatives found in the copepods which form part of its diet.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of the Seattle independent record label Sub Pop is tied closely to Soundgarden, since Sub Pop co-founder Jonathan Poneman funded Soundgarden's early releases, and the band's success led {{to the expansion of}} Sub Pop as a serious record label. Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain was a fan of Soundgarden's music, and reportedly Soundgarden's involvement with Sub Pop influenced Cobain to sign Nirvana with the label. Cobain also stated that Soundgarden was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> Seattle bands that he liked along with Tad and Mudhoney. In rare footage in the 2015 documentary , Cobain can be seen impersonating Chris Cornell singing Outshined.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, {{two large}} Native American groups {{controlled}} {{most of the}} Snake River: the Nez Perce, whose territory stretched from the southeastern Columbia Plateau into northern Oregon and western Idaho, and the Shoshone, who occupied the Snake River Plain both above and below Shoshone Falls. Lifestyles along the Snake River varied widely. Below Shoshone Falls, the economy centered on salmon, who often came up the river in enormous numbers. Salmon were the mainstay of the Nez Perce {{and most of the}} other tribes below Shoshone Falls. Above the falls, life was significantly different. The Snake River Plain forms <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> relatively easy paths across the main Rocky Mountains for many hundreds of miles, allowing Native Americans both east and west of the mountains to interact. As a result, the Shoshone centered on a trading economy.|$|E
5|$|For {{his service}} to the Indian nation, the {{president}} of India awarded Manekshaw a Padma Vibhushan in 1972 and conferred upon him the rank of field marshal, a first, on 3 January 1973. He became <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> two army generals of independent India to be awarded this rank; the other being Kodandera Madappa Cariappa who was awarded the rank in 1986. Manekshaw retired from active service a fortnight later on 15 January 1973 after a career of nearly four decades; he settled down with his wife Silloo in Coonoor, the civilian town next to Wellington Cantonment where he had served as commandant of the Defence Services Staff College, at an earlier time in his career. Popular with Gurkha soldiers, Nepal fêted Manekshaw as an honorary general of the Nepalese Army in 1972. A flyover bridge in Ahmedabad's Shivranjeeni area was named after him in 2008 by Narendra Modi, Chief Minister of Gujarat at that time.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have lived}} on the Santa Ana River for at least 9,000 years. In the period {{immediately}} before and during European colonization, there were four distinct indigenous groups in the area. The river was first seen by Europeans in 1769, when it received its name {{from members of the}} Spanish Portola expedition. Because it was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> reliable sources of water in a wide region, many large ranchos developed along the river and one of its major tributaries, Santiago Creek. After the area became part of the United States, the economy transitioned to agriculture, before urbanizing in the 20th century. Many cities established during this time including Santa Ana, Riverside and Anaheim derived their names from the river. In order to protect urban areas from the river's flood threat, major channelization and damming projects were undertaken in the 20th century, resulting in the loss of much of the natural river channel.|$|E
