From the US$ 2564 yearly cost of operating the <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> using electricity, it goes down to US$ 769 yearly for the kerosene <b>water</b> <b>heater,</b> US$ 1282 per year for the gas <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> and US$ 513 for biomass <b>water</b> <b>heater.</b> On the other hand, there is a reduction of carbon dioxide emission from 4500  kg yearly for the electric <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> to 2400 per year for the kerosene <b>water</b> <b>heater,</b> 1000 for the gas <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> and completely zero for biomass <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> when biomass is considered a biofuel which is a renewable energy source.

While many preexisting models were used, new models of condensing and heat pump <b>water</b> <b>heaters</b> were created specifically for this work {{to look at the}} majority of residential <b>water</b> <b>heaters</b> available on the market. The heat pump <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> model was extensively validated against both field test and lab test data and found to predict the performance of these units well in all of the situations examined. The condensing <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> model was compared to lab test data and found to provide a reasonable agreement with the measured data. A domestic hot water distribution system model was also created, validated, and used to examine the difference in distribution losses between heat pump <b>water</b> <b>heaters</b> and electric storage <b>water</b> <b>heaters.</b> Annual simulations looked at both the energy savings potential and economics of these technologies. Heat pump <b>water</b> <b>heaters</b> were significant winners in both cost and energy savings for electric <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> and proved to be a cost effective replacement for electric storage <b>water</b> <b>heaters</b> even before incentives were considered in many cases. For gas <b>water</b> <b>heaters,</b> all technologies were able to save some energy with solar <b>water</b> <b>heaters</b> providing the most significant savings.

This paper describes the method used to conduct the life-cycle cost (LCC) and payback period analysis for gas and electric storage <b>water</b> <b>heaters.</b> It presents the estimated change in LCC associated with more energy-efficient equipment, including heat pump electric <b>water</b> <b>heaters</b> and condensing gas <b>water</b> <b>heaters,</b> for a representative sample of U.

40|$|This paper investigates how {{to develop}} a learning-based demand {{response}} approach for electric <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> in a smart home that can minimize the energy cost of the <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> while meeting the comfort requirements of energy consumers. First, a learning-based, data-driven model of an electric <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> is developed by using a nonlinear autoregressive network with external input (NARX) using neural network.

40|$|Abstract. Solar <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> cannot supply {{hot water}} in cloudy and raining days alone. It in {{combination}} with {{air source heat pump}} <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> (ASHPWH) is a good choice. The performance of the two kinds of <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> is affected by the water temperature. It is important that the ASHPWH operate at a right temperature of the water. A solar <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> with 4 m 2 flat-plate collector assisted by a 1. 5 kW ASHPWH is studied in this paper. The results show that both the collector efficiency of the solar <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> and the COP of the ASHPWH system decreases as the water temperature increases. The highest and lowest collector efficiency of the solar <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> are 54. 4 % and 45. 6 % respectively. The COP of the ASHPWH system ranges from 6. 48 to 2. 61 as the water temperature increases. Operating sequences of these two kinds of <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> affect solar energy utilization ratio and the power input of the ASHPWH system. 1...|$|R

40|$|This report {{examines}} the energy, demand, and economic effects of three alternative electric water heating systems {{from the perspective}} of both the City of Austin Electric Utility and its ratepayers. An hourly computer simulation was used to model the operation of (1) a conventional electric resistance <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> (ERWH), (2) a heat pump <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> (HPWH), and (3) a heat recovery <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> (HRWH). Data from a previously conducted field test of solar <b>water</b> <b>heaters</b> (SWH) in the Austin area was used to compare this fourth water heating option.
