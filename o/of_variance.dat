5|$|The {{development}} of SAS began in 1966 after North Carolina State University re-hired Anthony Barr to program his analysis <b>of</b> <b>variance</b> and regression software {{so that it}} would run on IBM System/360 computers. The project was funded by the National Institute of Health and was originally intended to analyze agricultural data to improve crop yields. Barr was joined by student James Goodnight, who developed the software's statistical routines, and the two became project-leaders. In 1968, Barr and Goodnight integrated new multiple regression and analysis <b>of</b> <b>variance</b> routines. In 1972, after issuing the first release of SAS, the project lost its funding. According to Goodnight, this was because NIH only wanted to fund projects with medical applications. Goodnight continued teaching at the university for a salary of $1 and access to mainframe computers for use with the project, until it was funded by the University Statisticians of the Southern Experiment Stations the following year. John Sall joined the project in 1973 and contributed to the software's econometrics, time series, and matrix algebra. Another early participant, Caroll G. Perkins, contributed to SAS' early programming. Jolayne W. Service and Jane T. Helwig created SAS' first documentation.|$|E
5|$|The size of {{the brain}} and a person's {{intelligence}} are not strongly related. Studies tend to indicate small to moderate correlations (averaging around 0.3 to 0.4) between brain volume and IQ. The most consistent associations are observed within the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes, the hippocampi, and the cerebellum, but these only account for a relatively small amount <b>of</b> <b>variance</b> in IQ, which itself has only a partial relationship to general intelligence and real-world performance.|$|E
5|$|A {{central point}} of debate on GWA studies {{has been that}} most of the SNP {{variations}} found by GWA studies are associated with only a small increased risk of the disease, and have only a small predictive value. The median odds ratio is 1.33 per risk-SNP, with only a few showing odds ratios above 3.0. These magnitudes are considered small because they do not explain much of the heritable variation. This heritable variation is known from heritability studies based on monozygotic twins. For example, it is known that 80-90% <b>of</b> <b>variance</b> in height can be explained by hereditary differences, but GWA studies only account for a minority of this variance.|$|E

40|$|In {{estimation}} <b>of</b> ratio <b>of</b> <b>variances</b> in two normal distributions with unknown means, it {{has been}} shown in the literature that simple and crude ratio estimators based on two sample variances are dominated by shrinkage estimators using information contained in sample means. Of these, a natural double shrinkage estimator is the ratio of shrinkage estimators <b>of</b> <b>variances,</b> but its improvement over the crude ratio estimator depends on loss functions, namely, the improvement has not been established except the Stein loss function. In this paper, this dominance property is shown for some convex loss functions including the Stein and quadratic loss functions in the general framework of distributions with positive parameters and shrinkage estimators. The resulting new finding is that the generalized Bayes estimator of the ratio <b>of</b> <b>variances</b> dominates the crude ratio estimator relative to the quadratic loss. The paper also shows that the dominance property of the double shrinkage estimator holds for estimation of the difference <b>of</b> <b>variances,</b> but it does not hold for estimation of the product and sum <b>of</b> <b>variances.</b> Finally, it is demonstrated that the double shrinkage estimators for the ratio, product, sum and differences <b>of</b> <b>variances</b> are connected to estimation of linear combinations of the normal positive means, and the dominance and non-dominance results of the double shrinkage estimators coincide with the corresponding dominance results in estimation of linear combinations of means...|$|R
