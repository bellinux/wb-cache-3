25|$|PAYG {{funds and}} Travelcard season tickets (but not Bus & Tram Passes) {{can also be}} {{purchased}} online via the Oyster online website <b>or</b> <b>by</b> <b>calling</b> the Oyster helpline; users must then select one station or tram stop where they will validate their card in order to load the funds or Travelcard purchased. This should be done {{as part of a}} normal journey to avoid the risk of paying an Oyster maximum fare.|$|E
25|$|A {{replacement}} for lost or stolen cards costs £15 and involves {{applying for a}} replacement card online <b>or</b> <b>by</b> <b>calling</b> the Oyster helpline. A new photograph is not required. The funds or remaining travel is non-transferable to a new student Oyster photocard and is refundable instead. The refund of a lost or stolen Oyster card {{is based on the}} original pro-rata daily rate. Thus, if you lose an annual student Oyster, the refund will not cover the remainder of the year, owing to the higher monthly/weekly pro-rata charges {{for the remainder of the}} year. This can leave students at a considerable disadvantage (adults can receive a replacement card with the remainder of their Travelcard loaded).|$|E

25|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, housing {{policy has been}} a devolved matter, and state support for the homeless, {{together}} with legal rights in housing, have therefore diverged to a certain degree. A national service, called Streetlink, was established in 2012 to help {{members of the public}} obtain near-immediate assistance for specific rough sleepers, {{with the support of the}} Government (as housing is a devolved matter, the service currently only extends to England). Currently, the service does not operate on a statutory basis, and the involvement of local authorities is merely due to political pressure from the government and charities, with funding being provided by the government (and others) on an ad-hoc basis. A member of the public who is concerned that someone is sleeping on the streets can report the individual's details via the Street Link website <b>or</b> <b>by</b> <b>calling</b> the referral line number on 0300 500 0914. Someone who finds themselves sleeping on the streets can also report their situation using the same methods. It is important to note that the Streetlink service is for those who are genuinely sleeping on the streets, and not those who may merely be begging, or ostensibly living their life on the streets despite a place to sleep elsewhere (such as a hostel or supported accommodation).|$|E
500|$|The works Banksy has {{included}} in Better Out Than In primarily consist of stencil graffiti, {{much of which}} are political in nature. His first installment, which he captioned [...] "the street is in play", depicted a child reaching {{for a bottle of}} spray paint on a sign reading [...] "graffiti is a crime". The sign was stolen and later replaced by Queens-based graffiti group Smart Crew with a new sign that read [...] "street art is a crime". Like most of his other works, the piece has audio accompaniment that can be heard either on the website <b>or</b> <b>by</b> <b>calling</b> a toll-free 800 number.|$|E
500|$|The plots for Bedsitcom were {{devised by}} a team of writers (led by Rob Gibbons, Neil Gibbons and {{producer}} Matt Crook) located in a garage {{on the ground floor of}} the apartment building that the contestants were staying in. The writers would often appear on screen and explain to the TV audience what their intention for each episode was. They communicated with Ash, Gibbon and Jones either by ringing them on their mobile phones, <b>or</b> <b>by</b> <b>calling</b> them downstairs to speak to them in person. They would occasionally change their plans for an episode—in [...] "Worst Case Scenario", for example, the writers altered their storyline from having Mel bring various animals into the flat to having the group kill Mel's goldfish after only one night.|$|E

50|$|Change ringing {{is the art}} of ringing a set of tuned bells in a {{controlled}} manner to produce variations in their striking sequences. This may be by method ringing in which the ringers commit to memory the rules for generating each change, <b>or</b> <b>by</b> <b>call</b> changes, where the ringers are instructed how to generate each new change <b>by</b> <b>calls</b> from a conductor. This creates a form of bell music which is continually changing, but which cannot be discerned as a conventional melody.|$|R

2500|$|The Texas constable is {{provided}} {{for in the}} Texas Constitution of 1876 (Article 5, Section 18), which calls for {{the election of a}} constable in each Texas precinct of a county, and counties may have between one and eight precincts each depending on their population. [...] The term of office for Texas constables is four years. However, when vacancies arise, the commissioner’s court of the respective county has the authority to appoint a replacement to serve out the remaining term. If no person is elected and qualified under law to fill an office of constable for seven consecutive years, the respective commissioner's court may declare the office dormant and it may not be filled by election or appointment. However, the commissioner's court may reinstate the office by a majority vote <b>or</b> <b>by</b> <b>calling</b> an election where a majority of precinct voters approve it.|$|E

2500|$|Fractional-reserve banking ordinarily {{functions}} smoothly. Relatively few depositors demand payment at {{any given}} time, and banks maintain a buffer of reserves to cover depositors' cash withdrawals and other demands for funds. [...] However, during a bank run or a generalized financial crisis, demands for withdrawal can exceed the bank's funding buffer, and the bank {{will be forced to}} raise additional reserves to avoid defaulting on its obligations. A bank can raise funds from additional borrowings (e.g., by borrowing in the interbank lending market or from the central bank), by selling assets, <b>or</b> <b>by</b> <b>calling</b> in short-term loans. If creditors are afraid that the bank is running out of reserves or is insolvent, they have an incentive to redeem their deposits as soon as possible before other depositors access the remaining reserves. Thus the fear of a bank run can actually precipitate the crisis.|$|E
2500|$|This {{might be}} in a file myfile.tex, as [...]tex is a common file {{extension}} for plain TeX files. By default, everything that follows a percent sign on a line is a comment, ignored by TeX. Running TeX on this file (for example, by typing texmyfile.tex in a command-line interpreter, <b>or</b> <b>by</b> <b>calling</b> it from a graphical user interface) will create an output file called myfile.dvi, representing the content of the page in a device independent format (DVI). A DVI file could then either be viewed on screen or converted to a suitable format for any of the various printers for which a device driver existed (printer support was generally not an operating system feature at the time that TeX was created). Knuth has said that there is nothing inherent in TeX that requires DVI as the output format, and later versions of TeX, notably pdfTeX, XeTeX and LuaTeX, all support output directly to PDF.|$|E
60|$|Beneath {{the shelter}} of one hut, in the bright blaze of the same fire, sat this varied group of adventurers, all so intent upon a single object that of {{whatever}} else they began to speak their closing words were sure to be illuminated with the Great Carbuncle. Several related the circumstances that brought them thither. One had listened to a traveller's tale of this marvellous stone in his own distant country, and had immediately been seized with such a thirst for beholding it as could only be quenched in its intensest lustre. Another, so long ago as when the famous Captain Smith visited these coasts, had seen it blazing far at sea, and had felt no rest in all the intervening years till now that he took up the search. A third, being encamped on a hunting-expedition full forty {{miles south of the}} White Mountains, awoke at midnight and beheld the Great Carbuncle gleaming like a meteor, so that the shadows of the trees fell backward from it. They spoke of the innumerable attempts which had been made to reach the spot, and of the singular fatality which had hitherto withheld success from all adventurers, though it might seem so easy to follow to its source a light that overpowered the moon and almost matched the sun. It was observable that each smiled scornfully at the madness of every other in anticipating better fortune than the past, yet nourished a scarcely-hidden conviction that he would himself be the favored one. As if to allay their too sanguine hopes, they recurred to the Indian traditions that a spirit kept watch about the gem and bewildered those who sought it either by removing it from peak to peak of the higher hills <b>or</b> <b>by</b> <b>calling</b> up a mist from the enchanted lake over which it hung. But these tales were deemed unworthy of credit, all professing to believe that the search had been baffled by want of sagacity or perseverance in the adventurers, or such other causes as might naturally obstruct the passage to any given point among the intricacies of forest, valley and mountain.|$|E
