5|$|Still {{friends with}} Martello, Buczynski {{initiated}} him up till the third degree of the Welsh Traditionalist tradition, in return receiving third degree initiation into the Strega tradition. At the same time, {{he was facing}} problems within his own tradition as <b>one</b> <b>couple</b> running their own Welsh outer coven, Claudia and Gerard Nero, had decided to abandon Buczynski's tradition and receive initiation into Gardnerianism from the Kneitals; they had ultimately decided to do so after becoming increasingly sceptical of his historical claims to Palaeolithic roots. They took their initiates, including Margot Adler, with them, much to Buczynski and Slater's annoyance, leading to {{a breakdown of the}} friendship that they had had with the Kneitals. His tradition nevertheless continued to grow and spread, and in January 1973, the tradition joined the Council of Earth Religions (COER), a pan-Pagan umbrella organisation founded the previous year to work for the common defence of the movement. His primary inner coven grew to a size that it had to divide into two at Midsummer 1973. His high priestess, Kay Smith, decided to take lead of one of them, while Eddie remained in the other, being joined by a new ritual consort named Judith. By August, there were two outer court covens of the Welsh tradition in New York City, and one each in Philadelphia and in Hopewell, Virginia.|$|E

Official misconduct in the second degree is a Class B misdemeanor and carries a potential punishment of up to 90 days' imprisonment and fines of $250. The Rowan County Attorney's Office is prohibited from prosecuting Davis; Attorney General Cecil Watkins referred the official misconduct complaint to the Kentucky Attorney General's office, led by Attorney General Jack Conway. The Kentucky Attorney General's office conducted a review, and Conway issued a statement saying, [...] "We are a nation of laws, and no one can defy an order from a federal judge."

500|$|Two tabloid {{television}} shows accepted confidential leaked {{documents from the}} Los Angeles County Department of Children's Services for $20,000. A number of Jackson's former employees—most of whom had worked at his ranch—sold stories to the tabloids of alleged prior sexual misconduct on Jackson's part, instead of reporting their claims to police. <b>One</b> <b>couple</b> initially asked for $100,000 claiming that Jackson sexually caressed Macaulay Culkin. They were prepared to expand upon this allegation for a fee of $500,000, whereby they would allege that Jackson put his hands down Culkin's pants. When the story broke, Culkin strongly denied the allegation, and did so again in court during the 2003 trial of Michael Jackson. A former security guard made various allegations about Jackson, saying he was fired because he [...] "knew too much", and alleged that he was ordered by Jackson to destroy {{a photo of a}} naked boy. Instead of reporting this to police, Hard Copy accepted the story in return for $150,000. Afterwards, Jackson's maid, Branca Francia, alleged that she [...] "quit in disgust" [...] after seeing Jackson in a shower with a child, but did not inform the police. It later emerged that Francia was actually fired in 1991, but nevertheless sold her story to Hard Copy for $20,000.|$|E
500|$|Several {{people who}} were {{involved}} in the production of the original A-Team worked with show producers for this episode. Ron Jones wrote the music during the scene where Peter and his friends help the man in the bar; Jones had also written music for the actual The A-Team series in the 1980s. This episode marks the third appearance of Brian's wheelchair-using teacher; he originally appears in [...] "Ready, Willing, and Disabled" [...] and [...] "Brian the Bachelor" [...] when competing in the Special Olympics during the former episode and attempting to become a candidate for The Bachelorette in the latter episode. The professor's and his wife's voices were not played by a real person; they were made from a generic computer system in the studio. A deleted scene was animated which showed the professor informing Brian that he once had a student who was identical to him, but instead took human form and had a mustache. David Goodman commented this as being a pretty strange gag. Several viewers contacted Greg Colton, a Family Guy director, asking him if Roger Williams Park (a real public park in Rhode Island) was due to be demolished. He commented that <b>one</b> <b>couple</b> were extremely worried, because they were due to have their wedding there.

500|$|The TV {{documentary}} [...] explored {{gay rights}} and homophobia in numerous {{countries in the}} world, including Russia. [...] In it, Fry interviews a lesbian couple who discuss their fears that simply being out to their 16-year-old daughter and her friends could be taken as breaking this law, due to the law's prohibition [...] "on anyone disseminating information about homosexuality to under 18s". [...] The LGBT news magazine The Advocate described the law as criminalising [...] "any positive discussion of LGBT people, identities, or issues in forums that might be accessible to minors. In practice, the law has given police broad license to interpret almost any mention of being LGBT [...] whether uttered, printed, or signified by waving a rainbow flag [...] as just cause to arrest LGBT people." [...] The US State Department in its 2013 report on human rights in Russia noted the clarification from Roskomnadzor (the Russian Federal Service for Supervision in the Sphere of Telecom, Information Technologies and Mass Communications) that the [...] "gay propaganda" [...] prohibited under the law includes materials which [...] "directly or indirectly approve {{of people who are}} in nontraditional sexual relationships." [...] <b>One</b> <b>couple</b> interviewed by Fry said: [...] "Of course we are afraid because we really don't know what's going to happen next in the country. ... You just don't know if they can incarcerate you tomorrow for something or not." [...] Fry also interviewed politician Vitaly Milonov, the original proponent of the law, whose attempts to defend it have been strongly criticised; Milonov responded branding Fry as [...] "sick" [...] for making a suicide attempt while filming the documentary in an interview in which he also compared homosexuality with bestiality.|$|E

50|$|An Oldham {{coupling}} {{has three}} discs, <b>one</b> <b>coupled</b> to the input, <b>one</b> <b>coupled</b> to the output, and a middle disc that is joined {{to the first}} two by tongue and groove. The tongue and groove on one side is perpendicular to the tongue and groove on the other. The middle disc rotates around its center {{at the same speed}} as the input and output shafts. Its center traces a circular orbit, twice per rotation, around the midpoint between input and output shafts. Often springs are used to reduce backlash of the mechanism. An advantage to this type of coupling, as compared to two universal joints, is its compact size. The coupler is named for John Oldham who invented it in Ireland, in 1821, to solve a problem in a paddle steamer design.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, {{we propose}} {{two types of}} coupled {{oscillators}} networks and investigate their steady states. One network has two-dimensional honeycomb struc-ture. The other network has twedimensional lattice struc-ture. In the Honeycomb circuit, adjacent three oscillators are <b>coupled</b> by <b>one</b> <b>coupling</b> resistor and it is considered that the voltages of three oscillators around a coupling resistor make three-phase synchronization. On the other hand, in the Lat-tice circuit, four-oscillators are <b>coupled</b> by <b>one</b> <b>coupling</b> resis-tor and it is considered that the voltages of four oscillators around a coupling resistor make four-phase synchronization. As a result, our networks are expected to generate various synchronization patterns. In our networks each oscillator is connected to only its adjacent oscillators and various patterns are generated according to the initial condition. Therefore, our network {{is expected to be}} utilized as a cellular neural network in the future...|$|R

2500|$|Grievers {{can make}} meaning of death through philanthropic {{services}} such as charities, foundations, and organizations. Meaning-making through philanthropy can create financial support, social support, emotional support, and helps create positive results from the negative experience of the death. For example, <b>one</b> <b>couple</b> that lost a child described how they developed [...] "Nora's Project" [...] after their daughter with a disability died, {{in order to help}} provide wheelchairs for children with disabilities around the world. The mother said: [...] "With Nora's Project, I am also healing. I am able to turn something that was horrific, the way she died, into something that will do good in the world". Like this mother, it is common for individuals to want to create or do something positive for others. Philanthropy helps people make meaning by continuously and altruistically honoring a life while simultaneously helping others going through a similar experience.|$|E
