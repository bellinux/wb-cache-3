25|$|Some dinophytes, like Kryptoperidinium and Durinskia have a diatom (heterokontophyte) derived {{chloroplast}}. These chloroplasts are {{bounded by}} up to five membranes, (depending <b>on</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> count the entire diatom endosymbiont as the chloroplast, or just the red algal derived chloroplast inside it). The diatom endosymbiont has been reduced relatively little—it still retains its original mitochondria, and has endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, a nucleus, and of course, red algal derived chloroplasts—practically a complete cell, all inside the host's endoplasmic reticulum lumen. However the diatom endosymbiont can't store its own food—its storage polysaccharide is found in granules in the dinophyte host's cytoplasm instead. The diatom endosymbiont's nucleus is present, but it probably can't be called a nucleomorph because it {{shows no sign of}} genome reduction, and might have even been expanded. Diatoms have been engulfed by dinoflagellates at least three times.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, Callas told Lord Harewood, De Hildalgo had {{the real}} great {{training}}, {{maybe even the}} last real training of the real bel canto. As a young girl—thirteen years old—I was immediately thrown into her arms, meaning that I learned the secrets, the ways of this bel canto, which of course as you well know, is not just beautiful singing. It is a very hard training; it {{is a sort of}} a strait-jacket that you're supposed to put <b>on,</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> like it or not. You have to learn to read, to write, to form your sentences, how far you can go, fall, hurt yourself, put yourself back on your feet continuously. De Hidalgo had one method, which was the real bel canto way, where no matter how heavy a voice, it should always be kept light, it should always be worked on in a flexible way, never to weigh it down. It is a method of keeping the voice light and flexible and pushing the instrument into a certain zone where it might not be too large in sound, but penetrating. And teaching the scales, trills, all the bel canto embellishments, which is a whole vast language of its own.|$|E

It's lawful to target an enemy commander in the field." [...] He called the killing of bin Laden [...] "a tremendous step forward in attaining justice for the nearly 3,000 innocent Americans who were murdered on September 11, 2001." [...] Commenting on the legality under international law, University of Michigan Law Professor Steven Ratner said, [...] "A lot of it depends <b>on</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> believe Osama bin Laden is a combatant in a war or a suspect in a mass murder."

It is utterly transparent Cold War propaganda, with delighted displays of military aircraft in action, an eager, anxious glimpse forward to the Space Race, and an interest in human-scale affairs so desultory as to make the machines and the ability to build and fly them seem much more important than the complications and consequences of militarism and war waged ..." ...|$|E

This depends, as so many other Zoroastrian beliefs and {{practices}} do, <b>on</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> are a [...] "reformist" [...] or a [...] "traditionalist." [...] The reformists, following the Gathas as their prime guide, judge the Vendidad harshly as being a deviation from the non-prescriptive, abstract teachings of the Gathas. For them, few if any of the laws or practices in the Vendidad are either in the spirit or the letter of the Gathas, and so they are not to be followed. The reformists prefer to regard the Vendidad as a document which has no religious value but is only of historic or anthropological interest. Many Zoroastrians, in Iran, India, and the world diaspora, inspired by reformists, have chosen to dispense with the Vendidad prescriptions entirely or only to follow those which they believe are not against the original spirit of the Gathas." ...|$|E
2500|$|Speaking of the [...] "ripple effect," [...] Rouse {{explains}} that, to {{a certain}} extent, it was dictated {{by a sense of}} narrative logic; [...] "it's really crucial that Carmen treats you differently depending <b>on</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> killed her or not. It doesn't make sense that she'd still be loving toward you if you killed her in cold blood." [...] However, it was also important that the player never feel locked into one morality; they could begin the game with bad morality and finish with good morality; [...] "you can travel down different moral paths, and both the beginning you started with and the choices you make during Ties that Bind will affect your final outcome.

30|$|This {{practice}} of perceiving cultural differences through phenotypical variations {{can be seen}} in the Swedish context as well. For example, Pred argues that visible differences like skin color or other bodily markers are interpreted as cultural differences in Swedish society (2000). The perception of culture depends on identifying differences that are visible. Moreover, Mattsson argues that the perception of Swedishness is based <b>on</b> visibility, <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> “look like a Swede” and “have a Swedish appearance,” which has a direct connotation to whiteness and Europeanness (2005, p. 150).|$|R

It {{was one of the worst}} storms, people here say, that has been experienced on the coast for many years, alike in its fury and in its duration, and all agreed that she would have been blown at least a thousand miles off the land before the gale spent its force. As the wind continued in the same quarter for a long time it would have taken the brig weeks to beat back against it, but when two months passed without your return, all concluded that you had either sunk before gaining the ship, or that she had gone down in the gale, or been wrecked among some of the islands into whose neighbourhood she must have been blown. However, the admiral continued to hope long after the rest of us had given you up. At the end of two months he appointed me his flag-midshipman to fill your place, as he especially said, until your return. This being the case, I have not shifted my berth, and your cabin has remained unoccupied.” ...|$|E

Farewell to color; {{that is to}} say, if {{the thing}} is to be seen distinctly, and you have only wise people to show it to; {{but if it is}} to be seen indistinctly, at a distance, color may become explanatory; and if you have simple people to show it to, color may be {{necessary}} to excite their imaginations, though not to excite yours. And the art is great always by meeting its conditions in the straightest way; and if it is to please a multitude of innocent and bluntly-minded persons, must express itself in the terms that will touch them; else it is not good. And I have to trace for you through the history of the past, and possibilities of the future, the expedients used by great sculptors to obtain clearness, impressiveness, or splendor; and the manner of their appeal to the people, under various light and shadow, and with reference to different degrees of public intelligence: such investigation resolving itself again and again, as we proceed, into questions absolutely ethical; as, for instance, whether color is to be bright or dull,--that is to say, for a populace cheerful or heartless;--whether it is to be delicate or strong,--that is to say, for a populace attentive or careless; whether it is to be a background like the sky, for a procession of young men and maidens, because your populace revere life--or the shadow of the vault behind a corpse stained with drops of blackened blood, for a populace taught to worship Death. Every critical determination of rightness depends on the obedience to some ethic law, by the most rational and, therefore, simplest means. And you see how it depends most, of all things, <b>on</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> are working for chosen persons, or for the mob; for the joy of the boudoir, or of the Borgo.
