The next step is to order free credit reports from each of the three national credit reporting companies. Lastly, report the identity theft to the FTC and print an FTC identity theft affidavit and then file a police report and ask for a copy of the report.|$|E

5000|$|The law is {{typically}} called the Collection Agencies Act and usually affords a government ministry {{power to make}} regulations as needed.

[...] Credit bureaus will still retain the debt and the collection <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>credit</b> file for 6-7 years depending on province.

40|$|Your {{credit report}} {{is a history}} of your credit {{management}} behavior. There are three major U. S. credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. The credit bureaus gather information <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>credit</b> use and provide it to lenders and other businesses. Your credit report affects your buying power. It affects your ability to obtain a credit card, a loan, a job, an apartment and sometimes the rate you pay for your automobile insurance.

40|$|To {{encourage}} home ownership, the United States {{tax code}} treats the financing {{and sale of}} housing differently from most other goods.

40|$|The ‘rewards’ {{offered by}} banks and shops are a {{dangerous}} illusion, says Richard Denniss WHEN Kim, of Kath and Kim fame, {{wanted to give}} her mum an overseas holiday she headed straight for the shops. How better to save up for an overseas holiday than to spend a fortune <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>credit</b> card and rack up some ‘Fly Buys’ while you are at it. But what began as satire has now become the central theme of a new advertising campaign by American Express. It’s not a credit card, it’s a trip to New York, proclaim the billboards. That’s not a pair of shoes, it’s a step closer to Paris, the full page advertisements inform us. The exact opposite is, of course, the case. In the real world, the more you spend on one thing, the less you can spend on others. But in the consumer debt based economy of contemporary Australia, such a view is decidedly ‘old school’. It seems that many Australians feel so unrecognised in their daily pursuits that they insist on being ‘rewarded’ for tasks as banal as buying toilet paper or booking an airline flight. Why would anyone shop around for cheap groceries when they can get a ‘reward’ for heading straight to the same shop every week? Or why would people plan their expenditures to meet their incomes and pay cash for their purchases when they can have anything they want right now and be ‘rewarded’ for it at the same time. Apart from providing us with rewards and recognising our loyalty, credit cards also help us to plan our finances. We can all take advantage of those wonderful interest-free periods and finally get our own back on the banks. Except of course we can’t. Despite widespread condemnation of the ‘greedy banks’, greedy people chasing reward points and interest free periods give the banks {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} per year in interest on their ‘interest free’ credit cards. What the banks are banking on is that our eyes will be bigger than our pay cheques, and on the whole they are right. Consumer debt is at an all-time high in Australia. Easy credit has seen consumer debt balloon with the average credit card debt growing by 10 per cent in the last 12 months. This trend is unlikely to abate with mobile phones teaching children from an early age to call now and worry later. But it is not just consumer greed that stops consumers from ever besting the banks in the ‘reward’ stakes. If the banks start to lose they can, as they have shown recently, always change the rules. A hundred thousand frequent flyer points might sound like a lot, but it is up to the airlines to decide how many you need to get from Sydney to Melbourne. Replacing the weekly pay packet with electronic funds transfer has changed fundamentally the way we think of money. Cash is no longer a scarce commodity that must be carefully rationed until the next pay day; it has simply become something that we pick up on the way home along with the milk and the bread. Of course our spending is ultimately constrained by our income in the long run, but as a famous economist once said, ‘in the long run we are all dead’. We know that we must spend less if we want to save more, but it can be so easy to save by simply buying more things when they are on sale, especially when there is nothing to pay until 2005. Our reliance on electronic pay packets, and the simultaneous roll out of credit cards, has resulted in a radical change in societal norms concerning responsible behaviour. Careful budgeting and the putting away of some contingency money for a ‘rainy day’ has been transformed from common sense to quaintly nostalgic in a bit over a decade. Gone are the days when children would be given their own bank account in primary school and encouraged to make a deposit, no matter how small, each week. These days the take out message for kids is that since the bank fees are greater than your pocket money you are better off just spending it. And it’s an important lesson. One of the main reasons that credit cards became so popular compared to debit cards was that the fees for using the banks’ money were deliberately set lower than the fees for using your own money. Going without new shoes and sunglasses might seem like a boring way to save up for an overseas holiday, but it is far more effective than waiting for the credit card company to ‘reward’ you. There is absolutely nothing wrong with using a credit card to smooth out the bumps in your personal finances, but there is something dangerously wrong with the logic that only by spending more can people afford that overseas holiday they want. As people work longer and longer hours in increasingly stressful work conditions perhaps it is understandable that they seek recognition and reward for their efforts, but the rewards offered by banks and shops are illusory. Mark Latham has recently tried to get the important issue of individual and national saving back on the political agenda. Maybe he needs to implement a frequent savers loyalty program. Such a plan might sound satirical, but Kath and Kim used to sound satirical as well. Richard Denniss is Senior research fellow at The Australia Institute, a Canberra based public interest think tank.
