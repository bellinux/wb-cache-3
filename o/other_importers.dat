2500|$|Canada's biggest {{market for}} seal pelts is Norway. Carino Limited {{is one of}} Newfoundland's largest seal pelt producers. Carino (CAnada–RIeber–NOrway) is {{marketing}} its seal pelts mainly through its parent company, GC Rieber Skinn, Bergen, Norway. Canada sold pelts to eleven countries in 2004. The next largest were Germany, Greenland, and China/Hong Kong. <b>Other</b> <b>importers</b> were Finland, Denmark, France, Greece, South Korea, and Russia.

30|$|This {{experiment}} is a replication {{of a previous}} experiment that tested how people choose between options related to missed opportunities in the past versus missed opportunities in the future, as reported in Shani et al. (2015). The original experiment gave the participant a scenario where a choice {{had to be made}} between two importers that offer the same mug for the same price. One importer offered the mug at a discounted price in the past and the <b>other</b> <b>importer</b> will offer the mug at a discounted price in the future. As the participants had to buy the mug at that time for the regular price, it was examined from which importer a purchase of the mug would cause a stronger feeling of regret.|$|R
30|$|Pistachio {{produce is}} of great {{importance}} {{in the world and}} considered as a valuable agricultural produce. This product is important for the economy of the producing countries as well as <b>other</b> <b>importer</b> countries. In this regard, countries which are capable of getting control over this product’s market would obtain considerable benefits; one way to do so is predicting market trend or the price of this product and the affecting factors. In this survey, initially, the affecting parameters on pistachio price are identified. Then, using a novel combined intelligent method, the price of this product is predicted. In addition, using analysis of variance method, the results of the proposed method are compared to other intelligent combined methods, such as Feed Forward-Particle Swarm Optimization, Elman- Imperialist Competitive Algorithm, Feed Forward-Imperialist Competitive Algorithm, Elman-Genetic Algorithm, and Feed Forward-Genetic Algorithm. The results of the mentioned comparison indicate that the proposed method owns an excellent performance.|$|R

5000|$|Ladas {{arrived in}} Brazil in 1990, when Brazilian {{president}} Fernando Collor lifted {{the ban on}} car imports. Lada was the first car maker to enter the Brazilian car market as an official importer, grey importers having already brought in other brands soon after the importation re-opening. Initially, the Lada 2105 (sedan) and 2104 (station wagon) models (badged as the [...] "Lada Laika") and the [...] "Lada Niva" [...] were successful, mostly among taxi drivers, because of their low prices and functionality. Between 1990 and 1992, Lada sold more cars than any <b>other</b> <b>importer</b> to Brazil. Following their arrival, Lada cars were regarded by consumers and local specialized media, as outdated and inefficient but their commercial success {{was due to the}} Lada's publicity campaign which gave their cars an image of imported vehicle affordable for almost everyone, combined with consumer curiosity for imported products, a novelty at the time.|$|R

50|$|Willing, Morris & Co funded its own slave-trading voyage. The ship did {{not carry}} {{enough to be}} {{profitable}} and, during a second trip, was captured by French privateers. The firm handled two slave auctions for <b>other</b> <b>importers,</b> offering a total of 23 slaves. In 1762 the firm advertised an agency sale in Wilmington, Delaware for over 100 Gold Coast slaves. The ship had docked in Wilmington to avoid the tariff. In 1765 on their last reported agency deal (out {{of a total of}} eight), the firm advertised 70 slaves who were brought in from Africa on the ship Marquis de Granby. The slaves were not sold in Philadelphia, as the owner took the ship and all the slaves to Jamaica.|$|E
5000|$|During the 1980s local Lada {{importers}} {{in various}} markets {{made their own}} upgrades to help compete with more modern SUVs. In the UK the Cossack model featured large body decals, roof rails, running boards, 15" [...] alloy wheels, and on some versions a sunroof, steel bullbars, spotlights, a rear-mounted spare tyre and semi-bucket seats. <b>Other</b> markets' <b>importers</b> made similar upgrades and many were also called Cossack.|$|R

50|$|The agency makes hard {{currency}} available to importers at several rates, {{with the best}} rate, CENCOEX, the official exchange rate 1 U.S. dollar for 6.3 bolivars, available to importers of food and medicine. A double rate, Complementary System of Foreign Exchange Administration (Sistema complementario de administracion de divisas (SICAD I)), twice the official exchange rate but still favorable, goes to importers of culturally important items such as Scotch, popular in Venezuela, and Barbie dolls, again, popular with certain demographics. A third rate, Alternative Foreign Exchange System (Sistema cambiario alternativo de divisas (SICAD II)), quite unfavorable at 50 times the official exchange rate, is offered to <b>other</b> <b>importers.</b> The black market rate, as of late December 2014, was 173 to 1 and rising rapidly.

50|$|After World War II {{there was}} {{rationing}} {{of coffee and}} NKL was not given a quota relative to their proportion of sales, resulting in the need to purchase coffee quotas from <b>other</b> <b>importers.</b> Also, at this time the quality of coffee varied greatly because the wholesalers {{were not able to}} test the burnt coffee, only the raw beans. To solve this, NKL started its own coffee house in 1953 which allowed NKL to distribute its own imported coffee and test the burnt produce. But the greatest change was the introduction of the yellow and red bags of coffee that replaced the loose weight sale of the beans. Import was still restricted until 1960 due to restrictions, and that Norway had an agreement with Brazil to exchange coffee with clipfish. After 1960 Coop introduced vacuum packaged coffee, at first canned and later hard vacuumed, though in the 1980s loose weight coffee was reintroduced.|$|E

40|$|As China's {{demand for}} energy grows, so does its {{dependence}} on imported oil. Currently, over 40 percent of China's total oil consumption derives from foreign sources making a supply disruption of the oil import routes an unthinkable blow to its national economy. Oil supply security has thus become the contemporary imperative and has raised a number of critical questions. Will oil {{be used as a}} weapon against China by exporters? Will a shortage or undersupply of oil resources lead to energy wars between China and <b>other</b> major <b>importers</b> such as the United States and Japan? Politicians and scholars must think hard about these critical issues...|$|R
50|$|Together {{with two}} <b>other</b> food <b>importers,</b> Big Alpha Foods Inc. and Doric Foods Inc., Krinos was {{formerly}} controlled by John Moschalaidis, who founded it in 1985 or earlier. In 1988 {{he was sentenced}} to two years' imprisonment after pleading guilty to importing contaminated cheese and mislabeling dairy products. His son, Eric Moschalaidis, is currently chairman of the company. Krinos was also found in 1990 to be selling a banned dye for Easter eggs, and in 1997 to be selling mislabeled cooking oil. In 2005 an investigation by WABC reported on by ABC's Good Morning America showed that some of the company's extra-virgin olive oil contained cheaper ingredients.|$|R
5000|$|In 1972 a {{short grain}} crop in the USSR {{resulted}} in the Soviet Union quietly concluding grain purchasing contracts from {{a relatively small number}} of the secretive private multinational grain traders who dominated world trade in cereals. Because crop surveys in mid-spring had given the impression of a normal crop, FAS's agricultural attaché in Moscow chose not to follow up with additional crop observation travel, and thus missed a severe drought that set in after the last trip. As a result of this lapse, international grain traders and exporting nations were unaware of the Soviets' dire need for massive grain imports. By the time the scope of Soviet purchases became known, the USSR had locked in supplies at low, subsidized prices, leaving <b>other</b> <b>importers</b> and consumers scrambling for what was left at significantly higher prices. This event, known as the [...] "Great Grain Robbery", led to creation in the Foreign Agricultural Service of a satellite imagery unit for remote sensing of foreign crop conditions, negotiation of a long-term grain agreement (LTA) with the Soviet Union, and imposition of an export sales reporting requirement for U.S. grain exporters. It also impressed on FAS the need for [...] "boots-on-the-ground" [...] observation of crop conditions in critical countries.|$|E
5000|$|The {{crisis has}} also been seen as {{worsening}} relations between Britain and the Thirteen Colonies in America. [...] Among other stresses, the East India Company, already in financial difficulties, was further weakened by the crisis, and in 1773 managed to persuade Parliament to pass the Tea Act, exempting it from the duty all <b>other</b> <b>importers</b> in the colonies had to pay. The unpopularity of {{this led to the}} Boston Tea Party {{at the end of the}} year. [...] According to a sermon of 1775, Alexander Fordyce: had a mind not ill-formed for commerce, and from his early success in it was enabled, though of an obscure original, to live respectably. If his views had extended no farther, it would have been well, but his ambition was unbounded. the revenue of a kingdom would hardly have sufficed to have executed his schemes. He seemed bent on engrossing the trade of the whole world. Large sums were borrowed of one and of another. His friends advanced liberally, and so high was his reputation, that they had no doubt of their effects being secure. But the event proved that they were wretchedly deceived. His affairs were embarrassed, his difficulties increased, and at length grew inextricable; a total stoppage ensued; the issue of a commission of bankruptcy, by some chicanery, was prevented; and but a small part of his enormous debts hath been paid to this very hour. I shall not pretend to enumerate the many families which by his means sunk into distress. His fall was like the fall of a towering structure which overwhelms numbers with its ruins. It deserves, however, particular mention, that the news of his failure despatched one brother to the regions of the dead, and, which is yet more lamentable, drove another into a state of insanity.|$|E
40|$|This report {{examines}} inaccuracies in some {{commonly held}} views of China's National Oil Companies (NOCs). Until now, {{there has been}} little analysis to test the widely held presumption that these companies act under the instructions and in close co-ordination with the Chinese government. Nor have critics been challenged on the validity of their concerns about investments made by these NOCs, and how they could be blocking supplies of oil for other importing countries. The IEA analysis, however, finds that contrary to these views, the NOCs actually operate {{with a high degree of}} independence from the Chinese government, and their investments have in fact largely boosted global supplies of oil and gas, which <b>other</b> <b>importers</b> rely on. ...|$|E

The model makes explicit the strategic interaction between governments and firms in the export market. We then analyze the effect of a change in the most significant parameters on the equilibrium.
