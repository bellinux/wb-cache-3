40|$|Sanitary sewer {{overflows}} {{are extremely}} detrimental to a surrounding watershed. An overflow occurs when volume exceeds capacity. There are several causes of an overflow; {{one of these}} causes is poorly maintained sewer clean <b>out</b> <b>stations,</b> which lead to blockages. Blockages are caused by grease buildup or other foreign objects. These clean <b>out</b> <b>stations</b> need to be serviced regularly to avoid blockages {{and to provide a}} more free flowing system. By using GIS, with a network analyst extension, I was able to design routes for a fleet of MAWSS (Mobile Area Water and Sewer System) trucks to cover all of these sewer clean outs in the most timely efficient way. These routes were designed based on where the clean outs are and the number of trucks that will go <b>out</b> cleaning these <b>stations.</b> Historic traffic data was also gathered from the City of Mobile. By being more efficient cleaning the sewer lines, the number of sanitary sewer overflows should be reduced, thus improving the water quality of the surrounding watershed...|$|R
