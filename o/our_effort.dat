500|$|The Catholic Church, {{through the}} aid {{arm of the}} Catholic Bishops' Conference of India, Caritas India, sent [...] to Tamil Nadu. Amrit Sangma, Caritas India {{communication}} officer, said the organisation would provide food, wash kits and clothes to affected people {{with the support of}} four local partners. [...] "Based on [...] general understanding in such situations, <b>our</b> <b>effort</b> will be to bring these basic support to [...] neediest families who may be sheltered in school buildings and other government managed camps," [...] Executive Director Fr. Frederick D’Souza said. Relief work was initially intended to be mostly concentrated in the three districts of Kanchipuram, Villupuram and Thiruvallur, with efforts to widen following further assessments.|$|E
500|$|Christopher Hitchens {{wrote in}} Slate that {{official}} {{reaction in the}} Westparticularly the United Stateswas too lenient toward the protesters and Muslim community in Denmark, and insufficiently supportive of Denmark {{and the right to}} free speech. He said, [...] "nobody in authority can be found to state the obvious and the necessary—that we stand with the Danes against this defamation and blackmail and sabotage. Instead, all compassion and concern is apparently to be expended upon those who lit the powder trail, and who yell and scream for joy as the embassies of democracies are put to the torch in the capital cities of miserable, fly-blown dictatorships. Let's be sure we haven't hurt the vandals' feelings." [...] William Kristol also wrote that the response of Western leaders, {{with the exception of the}} Danish Prime Minister, was too weak and that the issue was used as an excuse by [...] "those who are threatened by <b>our</b> <b>effort</b> to help liberalize and civilize the Middle East" [...] to fight back against the [...] "assault" [...] on radical Islamists and Middle Eastern dictatorships.|$|E

2500|$|On October 5, 1850, the General Convention of the Christian Church {{passed a}} {{resolution}} stating [...] "that our responsibility to the community, and the advancement of our interests as a denomination, demand of us the establishing of a College." [...] The delegates further pledged [...] "the sum of one hundred thousand dollars as the standard by which to measure our zeal and <b>our</b> <b>effort</b> in raising the means for establishing the contemplated College." [...] The Committee on the Plan for a College was formed to undertake the founding of a college, and make decisions regarding {{the name of the}} school, the endowment, fundraising, faculty, and administration. Most notably, the committee decided that the college [...] "shall afford equal privileges to students of both sexes." [...] The Christian Connection sect wanted the new college to be sectarian, but the planning committee decided otherwise.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Eric Yoffie, {{president}} of the Union for Reform Judaism, called J Street's reaction to the Israeli invasion of Gaza [...] "morally deficient, profoundly {{out of touch with}} Jewish sentiment and also appallingly naïve". J Street responded stating, [...] "It is hard for us to understand how the leading reform rabbi in North America could call <b>our</b> <b>effort</b> to articulate a nuanced view on these difficult issues 'morally deficient'. If our views are 'naive' and 'morally deficient', then so are the views of scores of Israeli journalists, security analysts, distinguished authors, and retired IDF officers who have posed the same questions about the Gaza attack as we have." [...] Despite this rebuttal, J Street subsequently invited Yoffie to its 2009 convention, and he subsequently praised the organization's stance on the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict, which was closer to that of other American Jewish organizations.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2010 the Hartwell Paper was {{published}} by the London School of Economics {{in collaboration with the}} University of Oxford. This paper was written by 14 academics from various disciplines in the sciences and humanities, and also some policies thinkers, and they argued that the Kyoto Protocol crashed in late 2009 and [...] "has failed to produce any discernable real world reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases in fifteen years." [...] They argued that this failure opened an opportunity to set climate policy free from Kyoto and the paper advocates a controversial and piecemeal approach to decarbonization of the global economy. The Hartwell paper proposes, [...] "the organising principle of <b>our</b> <b>effort</b> should be the raising up of human dignity via three overarching objectives: ensuring energy access for all; ensuring that we develop in a manner that does not undermine the essential functioning of the Earth system; ensuring that our societies are adequately equipped to withstand the risks and dangers that come from all the vagaries of climate, whatever their cause may be".|$|E

2500|$|In May 2013, {{two years}} after the {{assassination}} of Osama bin Laden, Barack Obama delivered a speech that employed the term global war on terror put in quotation marks (as officially transcribed by the White House): ″Now, make no mistake, our nation is still threatened by terrorists. <...> But {{we have to recognize that}} the threat has shifted and evolved from the one that came to our shores on 9/11. <...> From our use of drones to the detention of terrorist suspects, the decisions that we are making now will define the type of nation [...] — [...] and world [...] — [...] that we leave to our children. [...] So America is at a crossroads. [...] We must define the nature and scope of this struggle, or else it will define us. [...] We have to be mindful of James Madison’s warning that “No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare.” [...] <...> In Afghanistan, we will complete our transition to Afghan responsibility for that country’s security. <...> [...] Beyond Afghanistan, we must define <b>our</b> <b>effort</b> not as a boundless “global war on terror,” but rather as a series of persistent, targeted efforts to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten America. [...] In many cases, this will involve partnerships with other countries.″ Nevertheless, in the same speech, in a bid to emphasise the legality of military actions undertaken by the U.S., noting that Congress had authorised the use of force, he went on to say, ″Under domestic law, and international law, the United States is at war with al Qaeda, the Taliban, and their associated forces. [...] We are at war with an organization that right now would kill as many Americans as they could if we did not stop them first. [...] So this is a just war [...] — [...] a war waged proportionally, in last resort, and in self-defense.″ ...|$|E
