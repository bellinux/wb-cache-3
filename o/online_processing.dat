25|$|The {{possibility}} of <b>online</b> <b>processing</b> {{can be an}} MSR advantage. Continuous processing would reduce the inventory of fission products, control corrosion and improve neutron economy by removing fission products with high neutron absorption cross-section, especially xenon. This makes the MSR particularly suited to the neutron-poor thorium fuel cycle. Online fuel processing can introduce risks of fuel processing accidents, which can trigger release of radio isotopes.|$|E

50|$|Many banking {{systems that}} {{implement}} real-time posting are also built {{on top of}} database management systems which allows for the banking system to be more available, even continuously available. The database foundation also allows for multiple batch processes to occur concurrently with more flexibility than can be easily achieved with traditional memo-post systems. Also, the database allows concurrent batch and <b>online</b> <b>processing.</b> This doesn't mean that a database couldn't be used {{at the core of}} a memo-post systems, but it would not be commonly done.|$|E

5000|$|Data volumes for {{businesses}} are continually rising. Because of this, {{it is necessary}} to have parallel processing technology which provides maximum usage of server resources for massive data processing. To meet these needs, Tibero RDBMS supports transaction parallel processing functions optimized for OLTP (<b>Online</b> transaction <b>processing)</b> and SQL parallel processing functions optimized for OLAP (<b>Online</b> Analytical <b>Processing).</b> This allows queries to complete more quickly.|$|R
5000|$|Jobs can {{be started}} interactively, such {{as from a}} command line, or {{scheduled}} for non-interactive execution by a job scheduler, and then controlled via automatic or manual job control. Jobs that have finite input can complete, successfully or unsuccessfully, or fail to complete and eventually be terminated. By contrast, <b>online</b> <b>processing</b> such as by servers has open-ended input (they service requests {{as long as they}} run), and thus never complete, only stopping when terminated (sometimes called [...] "canceled"): a server's job is never done.|$|E
50|$|In 2003, the Scriptura Server was {{released}} and allowed use of XSL-FO templates from the Scriptura Designer as input format to create output in Portable Document Format (PDF). There were separate components for batch and <b>online</b> <b>processing.</b> At that time, Inventive Designers was invited by IBM's Watson Research Laboratories {{to join the}} W3C XSL Working Group. New output formats were added over the years, including AFP, PDF/A, TIFF, RTF, PostScript and PCL.

50|$|The IBM {{mainframe}} z/OS {{operating system}} or platform has {{arguably the most}} highly refined and evolved set of batch processing facilities owing to its origins, long history, and continuing evolution. Today such systems commonly support hundreds or even thousands of concurrent online and batch tasks within a single operating system image. Technologies that aid concurrent batch and <b>online</b> <b>processing</b> include Job Control Language (JCL), scripting languages such as REXX, Job Entry Subsystem (JES2 and JES3), Workload Manager (WLM), Automatic Restart Manager (ARM), Resource Recovery Services (RRS), DB2 data sharing, Parallel Sysplex, unique performance optimizations such as HiperDispatch, I/O channel architecture, and several others.|$|E

50|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of computers, cheque processing was performed manually by each institution. The advent of computers necessitated the development of peripheral equipment that would aid in the processing of cheques and other MICR encoded documents. Machines were developed {{that could be used to}} read the MICR information encoded at the bottom of the cheques and other financial instruments, so that they could be sorted and the information passed to the processing system for computer posting. Some of these machines operated in an offline capacity to further sort cheques and other documents as required without <b>online</b> <b>processing.</b> Many firms were developing and designing hardware and software for use by financial institutions to perform their day-to-day operations, among those IBM.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} {{portion of}} the MOGUL account {{is devoted to the}} claim that the acquired (and atrophied, or lost) linguistic structures are natural byproducts of <b>online</b> <b>processing.</b> This means that acquisitional mechanisms do not exist as such, but are embodied in the operations of the parser. This claim is made explicit in Acquisition by Processing Theory (APT). Processing concepts (activation levels, competition and so on), as exploited by other non-modular, domain-specific approaches, are realigned in MOGUL to explain how new cognitive systems emerge. APT is a hypothesis put forward by Sharwood Smith and Truscott {{as an integral part of}} MOGUL and is applicable to all kinds of cognitive development, not only language acquisition and language attrition (for a similar approach acquisition which is framed within an emergentist perspective, see O'Grady 2005).|$|E
50|$|The {{second of}} the {{parallel}} data processing platforms is called Roxie and functions as a rapid data delivery engine. This platform is designed as an online high-performance structured query and analysis platform or data warehouse delivering the parallel data access processing requirements of online applications through Web services interfaces supporting thousands of simultaneous queries and users with sub-second response times. Roxie utilizes a distributed indexed filesystem to provide parallel processing of queries using an optimized execution environment and filesystem for high-performance <b>online</b> <b>processing.</b> A Roxie cluster is similar in its function and capabilities to Hadoop with HBase and Hive capabilities added, and provides for near real time predictable query latencies. Both Thor and Roxie clusters utilize the ECL programming language for implementing applications, increasing continuity and programmer productivity.|$|E
