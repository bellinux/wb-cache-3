Over 1,000 signatures were collected <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> day alone, in a petition to be submitted to Chief Executive Donald Tsang and other senior officials. In addition, a group of protesters began a peaceful sit-in that day. So Sau Chung, veteran campaigner (now a monk), whose hunger strike against Star Ferry fare increases triggered the riots in 1966, came by to lend his support.|$|E
5|$|Smythe {{first became}} {{interested}} in horse racing as a boy, when he would take stories his father wrote at the track to the newspaper office downtown. Smythe started owning horses in the late 1920s, but he rarely had any success. One early purchase {{turned out to be}} one of his most famous. When Mrs. L. A. Livingston sold off her stable, he bought Rare Jewel, a filly, for $250. The filly regularly ran last. The horse was eligible for the Coronation Futurity Stakes, one of the best two-year-old races. Smythe was full of blind hope, and on the trainer's advice, entered her in the race. The day of the race, both the trainer and his partner gave the horse some brandy, unknown to Smythe, who bet over $100 on Rare Jewel. She won the race, a 100–1 longshot paying $214.40 on a $2 bet, besting future Queen's Plate winner Froth Blower. Between the winnings from his bets and his portion of the winner's purse as horse owner, Smythe won more than $10,000 <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> race. Three weeks later, he put his windfall to work for the Maple Leafs by purchasing star defenceman King Clancy from the depression-strapped Ottawa Senators for $35,000. The purchase was only possible because of his gambling winnings, as the other Maple Leafs owners refused to pay the Senators' then-high price, and only agreed when Smythe volunteered to use his own money.|$|E
5|$|We {{all had a}} {{collective}} feeling like we'd had enough {{of this kind of}} shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E

25|$|When {{the theme}} tune was updated in 2001, the closing credit music was a {{shortened}} {{version of the}} opening music. The main change was the lead-in music: two versions {{were used in the}} twelve years. Series 21 saw the theme tune being changed for a single series; it was made orchestral and only lasted one series. When Adam left the series at the end of series 25, a sad piano-based version was used. It has only ever been used <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> occasion.|$|E
25|$|In the House of Commons {{in early}} April Lloyd George would later claim, amidst press demands for Robertson’s {{restoration}} to office, that Wilson had predicted exactly {{when and where}} the German offensive would come. In fact on 21 March the day the German Michael Offensive began, Wilson advised that the attack “might only develop into a big raid or demonstration” and focussed the War Cabinet on the German threat to Asia.

[...] Venom's theme uses eight French horns. Raimi approved the new themes during their first performance, but rejected the initial music {{to the birth of}} Sandman, finding it too monstrous and not tragic enough. Young had to recompose much of his score at a later stage, as the producers felt there were not enough themes from the previous films. Ultimately, new themes for the love story, Aunt May, and Mary Jane were dropped.|$|E

500|$|Like the Grey Cup, {{awarded to}} {{the winner of the}} Canadian Football League, the Stanley Cup is {{engraved}} with the names of the winning players, coaches, management, and club staff. However, this was not always the case: one of Lord Stanley's original conditions was that each team could, at their own expense, add a ring to the Cup to commemorate their victory. Initially, there was only one base ring, which was attached {{to the bottom of the}} original bowl by the Montreal Hockey Club. Clubs engraved their team names, usually in the form [...] "TEAM NAME" [...] "YEAR WON", <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> ring until it was full in 1902. With no more room to engrave their names (and unwilling to pay for a second band), teams left their mark on the bowl itself. The 1907 Montreal Wanderers became the first club to record their name on the bowl's interior surface, and the first champion to record the name of every member of their team.|$|E
500|$|Although eleven {{songs were}} {{originally}} slated for the album, only ten made the final track listing. A song penned by Hanneman, entitled [...] "Final Six," [...] {{was meant for}} inclusion, with the song name originally declared as the album's title by vocalist Tom Araya to George Stroumboulopoulos of CBC's The Hour. Questioned about the album's title by Kevin and Bean of Los Angeles KROQ-FM, King replied [...] "I'm not positive it's been nailed yet. I think last week was the deadline and I'm not sure where it ended up, so I'm gonna {{have to take the}} fifth <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>one.</b> The way it was going, my vote was overlooked, so… That's why I'm not real thrilled about it." [...] However, Araya took one weekend off for vacation during the recording of the album and required a two-hour gall bladder operation the following Monday on May 5, 2006. Thus, he was unable to finish the vocals for the song in time for the album's release. King hinted [...] "Final Six" [...] might appear on a special digipack release of Christ Illusion: a release which eventually surfaced in July 2007. [...] "Final Six" [...] also appeared on the soundtrack to the film [...] the following year.|$|E
500|$|More {{than one}} scene proved {{problematic}} for Breezy {{during the filming}} of the episode, as the decontamination room set was an enclosed four wall set, meaning that in the scene where Archer rubs down Porthos with decontamination gel, Breezy's trainer Scott Rowe couldn't be on the set with her. Normally {{he would have been}} behind the camera assisting the director by ensuring the dog is looking wherever the scene required. He hoped that with him off the set, that Breezy would look where required and not directly at the camera. In order to prepare for the scene where Porthos leaps out of an immersion tank and into Archer's arms, Rowe had a mock-up created so he could practice it with Breezy. He said that [...] "By the time we went into it <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> day to prep on set with Scott, she was jumping out of it into my arms, but I had to make sure that she's going to jump out and do it into Scott's arms." [...] In the final scene, not only did Breezy leap into Bakula's arms, but she also licked him repeatedly on the face. This wasn't due to training, but because they wiped food on Bakula's face.|$|E

500|$|Over {{the years}} since European {{settlement}} Waterfall Gully has suffered from both bushfires and flooding. The gully was severely hit {{by a number of}} bushfires in 1939 that threatened the area, and further bushfires in the early 1940s caused considerable damage because of the war effort diverting supplies and personnel from the Country Fire Service (CFS). Significant floods occurred in 1889 and 1931, and, on the night of 7 November 2005, Waterfall Gully was one of several areas in Adelaide to experience severe flooding. Waterfall Gully was one of the hardest hit suburbs: Bob Stevenson, Duty Officer of the State Emergency Service (SES), commented that [...] "There's an area called Waterfall Gully Road, in the foothills, where one of the creeks comes down, and there's quite a few houses affected there ... there was 40 or so houses affected <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> road alone." [...] Properties were flooded, two bridges nearly collapsed, and [...] of road was washed away. Burnside council workers, the CFS and the SES repaired the initial damage on the night while reconstruction of infrastructure commenced in late November. Much of the road had been inaccessible, and the suburb was closed except to residents and emergency workers {{for the remainder of the}} month.|$|E
500|$|With Fox not reprising her role, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley {{was chosen}} to play Sam's new love interest. Ramón Rodríguez was {{initially}} planned {{to be in the}} film, in a role bigger than the one he had in Revenge of the Fallen, but he was dropped during early production. Shia LaBeouf stated that this would be his last film in the series, also concluding that director Michael Bay will not return for a fourth installment, though it was later confirmed that Bay would return as director in the fourth film. A few well-known actors such as John Malkovich and Frances McDormand also gained selected roles for the film. Malkovich explains: [...] "I play a guy called Bruce Brazos, who's just a loudmouth, kind of business man who's Shia's character's boss. Who's just a jerk, and a kind of a loud one. But a fun character. Nice. It was fun. Very, very enjoyable, just with Shia, Rosie a little bit, and with John Turturro. So, for me, it was a blast." [...] Another well-known actor, Ken Jeong, was cast as an eccentric co-worker and stalker. Jeong described the film, [...] "Yeah, it's a small role in Transformers but yeah. I had an out of body experience working <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> because I just couldn't believe I was there. Still, that was not a thing where oh, I'm {{going to be a part}} of a blockbuster franchise like Transformers 3 or even now Hangover 2 for that matter. So I can't believe I'm a part of these franchises in any way. It was amazing. Michael Bay is brilliant and it'll blow your mind." ...|$|E
