5|$|Dozens of {{communities}} across America have suffered thefts of Baby Jesus figurines, and, in some instances, entire nativity scenes, Washington, D.C. journalist Daniel Nasaw reports for the British newspaper The Guardian. He <b>observes</b> <b>that</b> {{it is unclear}} whether such theft is on the rise, as it is not tracked by federal law enforcement.|$|E
5|$|On {{the counts}} under {{which he was}} convicted, Berger was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment, but {{received}} credit for the nearly four years during {{which he had been}} in custody awaiting trial. Peter Maguire <b>observes</b> <b>that</b> given the status of the defendants and the body of evidence against them, the sentences given to all those indicted in the Ministries Trial were light.|$|E
5|$|The author {{questions}} {{the actions of}} the media with respect to privacy. He <b>observes</b> <b>that</b> public expectations regarding morality and what constitutes an impermissible violation of the right to privacy has changed over time. Lewis cites the dissenting opinion by Brandeis in Olmstead v. United States, which supported a right to privacy.|$|E

5|$|Albert Speer {{said that}} though Himmler seemed pedantic and {{insignificant}} on the surface, {{he was a}} good decision maker, had a talent for selecting highly competent staff, and successfully inserted the SS into every aspect of daily life. Historian Peter Longerich <b>observes</b> <b>that</b> Himmler's ability to consolidate his ever-increasing powers and responsibilities into a coherent system {{under the auspices of the}} SS led him to become one of the most powerful men in the Third Reich.|$|E
5|$|Alexander Wynne, {{author of}} The Origin of Buddhist Meditation, <b>observes</b> <b>that</b> formless {{meditation}} and elemental meditation might have {{originated in the}} Upanishadic tradition. The earliest reference to meditation is in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, {{one of the oldest}} Upanishads. Chandogya Upanishad describes the five kinds of vital energies (prana). Concepts used later in many yoga traditions such as internal sound and veins (nadis) are also described in the Upanishad. Taittiriya Upanishad defines yoga as the mastery of body and senses.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} {{theory to}} the corpse's identity was {{suggested in the}} history The Secrets of HMS Dasher (2004). This suggested that in March 1943 {{there was an explosion}} on , which sank, killing 379 men; one of these corpses was purportedly used. The military historian Denis Smyth dismisses the suggestion, and <b>observes</b> <b>that</b> the official records of the operation state that Michael was the body.|$|E

When Ralph is freed by a museum employee, Marge and Chief Wiggum are there to meet him. Marge <b>observes</b> <b>that</b> Ralph has a vivid {{imagination}} and learns that he has no friends to play with; she arranges a play-date for Ralph to spend time with a horrified Bart.|$|E
5|$|Chopin's {{influence}} is marked {{in the first}} two pieces. Orledge <b>observes</b> <b>that</b> the right-hand figuration at the end of No 1 is remarkably similar to {{that at the end of}} Chopin's Waltz in E minor. In No 2 Nectoux detects the additional influence of Liszt (Au bord d'une source) in the opening bars. In the closing bars of No 2, Orledge finds a resemblance to the end of Chopin's Grande Valse Brillante, Op, 18.|$|E
5|$|Duckles <b>observes</b> <b>that</b> by 1651, the {{transition}} from the lute song to the continuo song was complete. Printed versions of songs can not be entirely trusted to represent what was sung, since, in order to keep engraving costs manageable, they would economize on written vocal embellishments. That's why manuscript sources are crucial to our understanding of transition to Baroque vocal styles. Duckles concludes by warning that those who study early 17th century lyric poetry must do so in conjunction with their intended musical settings, since words and music are inseparable.|$|E

An instructor at the Tulips School for young children with developmental disabilities, Nikumbh's teaching style is markedly {{different from that of}} his strict predecessor, and he quickly <b>observes</b> <b>that</b> Ishaan is unhappy and contributes little to class activities. He reviews Ishaan's work and concludes that his academic shortcomings are indicative of dyslexia.|$|E
5|$|Judy Taylor, {{author of}} several books about Potter and her works, <b>observes</b> <b>that</b> Potter had {{difficulty}} drawing the human form, and, {{as a result of her}} limitations, restricted depictions of Mr. McGregor in The Flopsy Bunnies to his hands and feet. Any awkwardness in their depictions was minimized by presenting his hands and feet in isolation and from the bunnies' point of view. In the few full-length illustrations of Mr. McGregor, the need to depict his face was eliminated by presenting him in the middle or far distance and from the rear.|$|E

Moments before his hanging, {{the discovery of}} the suicide note saves him. Louis finds both Edith and Sibella waiting for him outside the prison. When a reporter tells him that Tit-Bits magazine wishes to publish his memoirs, Louis suddenly remembers that he left his detailed confession in his cell.|$|E

This is because the demand is price and stock {{dependent}} so if the price increases, the demand decreases which results in increase in the total cost and vice versa.

5|$|Nils Melzer {{presents}} an historical, legal and moral examination of targeted killing. The author <b>observes</b> <b>that</b> after September 11, the Western world grew {{more supportive of}} targeted killing than ever before. The book recounts in depth how state-sanctioned targeted killing is perceived in other countries. He defines targeted killing as the premeditated selection of an individual person not yet in custody for elimination by force. Melzer analyzes {{all areas of the}} topic.|$|E
5|$|No queen consort of Menkauhor {{has been}} {{identified}} for certain. The Egyptologist Wilfried Seipel has proposed that Khuit I was a queen of Menkauhor. Based on the dating of the tombs surrounding Khuit's burial, Seipel argues that she lived during the mid-Fifth Dynasty. By the process of elimination, he attributes known queens to each king of the period, which leaves only Menkauhor {{as a candidate for}} her king. These arguments are criticized by the Egyptologist Michel Baud, who <b>observes</b> <b>that</b> pharaohs could have had more than one queen.|$|E
5|$|Smyth {{writes that}} as a result of Husky, Hitler {{suspended}} the Kursk offensive on 13July. This was partly because of the performance of the Soviet army, but partly because he still assumed that the Allied landing on Sicily was a feint that preceded the invasion in the Balkans, and he wanted to have troops available for fast deployment to meet them. Smyth <b>observes</b> <b>that</b> once Hitler gave up the initiative to the Soviets, he never regained it.|$|E
