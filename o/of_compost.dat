30|$|Visual {{observation}} {{in terms of}} texture, color, odor, and microbial evolution during the whole period <b>of</b> <b>composting</b> revealed that physical characteristics <b>of</b> all <b>compost</b> piles were similar {{during the first week}} <b>of</b> <b>composting.</b> Insignificant physical changes were noticeable except that an appearance of white fungi was observed from day 1 <b>of</b> <b>composting.</b> During the second and third week <b>of</b> <b>composting,</b> <b>composting</b> materials were <b>of</b> smaller sizes with brownish color given that white fungi could still be visually observed.

40|$|Thermochemolysis {{coupled with}} gas {{chromatography}} and mass spectrometry {{were applied to}} determine the chemical structure of fulvic acids (FA) extracted from a sewage sludge and straw mixture at different steps <b>of</b> <b>composting.</b> The FA starting structures were composed mainly of mono-, di- and tri-methoxy (alkyl) benzoic acids representing lignin derivatives in an advanced stage of oxidation, {{as well as of}} methylated polyphenols and a series of fatty acids saturated C 15, C 16, C 18, unsaturated and branched C 18 : 1. Besides, there are many unidentified structures suspected to be N-containing compounds. During the composting process, the fate of the three structural typical monomer units of lignin was followed. The p-hydroxyphenyl units showed a strong relative decrease especially at the beginning <b>of</b> <b>composting.</b> The guiaicyl units showed a steady increase in course <b>of</b> <b>composting.</b> A relative decrease of syringyl units was noted at the beginning <b>of</b> <b>composting,</b> but they then relatively increased towards the end <b>of</b> <b>composting.</b> These changes support the formation during <b>composting</b> <b>of</b> more oxidized units. All subunits composing the fulvic acid structures have been subdivided into main five groups of similar chemical structure. The lignin-like C 6 –C 3 subunits showed a relative decrease during composting attributed to microbial oxidation, but there was a relative increase during the intermediate step <b>of</b> <b>composting</b> related probably <b>of</b> an enhancing of lignin solubility. The C 6 –C 1 subunits were reduced at the beginning <b>of</b> <b>composting,</b> which mainly attributed to the oxidation of 4 -methoxybenzaldehyde to hydroquinones derivatives under the composting conditions. Although, the relative increase of these subunits (C 6 –C 1) at the end <b>of</b> <b>composting</b> originates from oxidation of C 6 –C 3 lignin side-chains or could be partly attributed to microbial neosynthesis. The unidentified N-containing compounds increased strongly during course <b>of</b> <b>composting.</b> The rise in the level of fatty acids at the beginning <b>of</b> <b>composting</b> is attributed to an increase of branched-chain fatty acids such as C 18 : 1 commonly used as bacterial biomarkers. Their amounts were greatly reduced at the end <b>of</b> <b>composting.</b> Both the Shannon–Weaver and similitude indices show a relative increase in structural diversity at the start <b>of</b> <b>composting</b> conditions following the appearance of hydroquinone derivatives and unidentified nitrogen compounds in the FA network. But, the produced FA structure reaches a certain level of homogeneity at the end <b>of</b> <b>composting</b> through self-polycondensation or recombination of C 6 –C 1 subunits and hydroquinones derivatives with N-containing compounds...|$|R

In an attempt to ease consumer concern the Japanese government promised to impose inspections on all this beef, and to buy the meat back when higher-than-permissible cesium levels were detected during the tests. The government planned to eventually pass on the buy-back costs to TEPCO. The same day the Japanese ministry of agriculture urged farmers and merchants to renounce the use and sale <b>of</b> <b>compost</b> made of manure from cows {{that may have been}} fed the contaminated straw.

500|$|Composting, the {{purposeful}} biodegradation {{of organic}} matter by microorganisms, [...] {{is among the most}} simple ways of treating food waste and thereby preventing it being sent to landfill. Since all biodegradable materials will eventually oxidise to become compost, the process can be undertaken at home with no running costs, although equipment can accelerate the process. Most components of food waste are putrescibles and will be broken down in a compost, however some exceptions will not (e.g. cooked foods and feces) and can attract vermin. The effectiveness of composting food waste depends on the available space (or storage capacity {{in the case of a}} compost bin) and the method of composting. Unlike in landfill, where it is mixed with other (non-biodegradable) materials, food waste decomposing in a compost does not release harmful gases. Similarly to compost created from other waste sources, composted food waste can be used to return nutrients to the soil if spread on the garden (see uses <b>of</b> <b>compost).</b>|$|E
2500|$|Composting toilets use {{bacteria}} to decompose human feces into useful, odourless, sanitary compost. The process is sanitary because soil bacteria eat the human pathogens {{as well as}} most of the mass of the waste. [...] Nevertheless, most health authorities forbid direct use of [...] "humanure" [...] for growing food. The risk is microbial and viral contamination. [...] In a dry composting toilet, the waste is evaporated or digested to gas (mostly carbon dioxide) and vented, so a toilet produces only a few pounds <b>of</b> <b>compost</b> every six months. [...] To control the odor, modern toilets use a small fan to keep the toilet under negative pressure, and exhaust the gasses to a vent pipe.|$|E
30|$|The {{biodegradation}} {{process of}} organic wastes is markedly {{influenced by the}} methods <b>of</b> <b>composting</b> employed. Turned windrows (WC) and composting involving earthworms (VC and WVC) hasten the biodegradation process of organic wastes and result in the production <b>of</b> stable <b>compost</b> earlier than the traditional pit method <b>of</b> <b>composting</b> (PC). Even though all the tested methods <b>of</b> <b>composting</b> remarkably reduced the pathogenic organisms (faecal coliforms and helminth eggs), {{it was only the}} WVC method that qualify the standard set by WHO, keeping the concentration of helminth egg below the threshold level.

40|$|Lack {{of access}} to {{improved}} sanitation in Indonesia is reflected in persistence of practicing open defecation causing diarrhoea that is a major reason <b>of</b> under-five mortality. <b>Composting</b> toilets are considered as ecological sanitation representing dry type of sanitation system that is independent of water supply. Due to natural processes <b>of</b> <b>composting</b> that occur under specific conditions, human waste is transformed into compost {{that can be used}} as fertiliser. Although the approach of sustainable sanitation is being introduced in many developing countries, ecological sanitation have not yet been widely implemented in Indonesia except small pilot projects. However, due to sanitation programme of local non-government organisation Project Hope Sumba settled on Indonesian island <b>of</b> Sumba, <b>composting</b> toilets have been built to serve local people as improved sanitation to eradicate open defecation. The objective of the thesis was to assess user acceptance <b>of</b> <b>composting</b> toilets and perception of ecological sanitation in sub-district of Wewewa Tengah of West Sumba. Additionally, identification of criteria that influence acceptance <b>of</b> <b>composting</b> toilets have been summarized. Primary data have been collected in February and March 2015. The research was based on the interview accompanied by the structured questionnaire with 80 respondents who obtained the composting toilets within the sanitation programme. Waterless single-vault and double vault composting toilets without mixing urine and excreta device were installed as well as urine-diverting ones. Based on the survey, majority of the beneficiaries 57. 5 % has decided to quit using the composting toilets and rebuilt them to septic tank system. The main reasons for stop using the toilets were the fact that composting toilet does not work correctly because of lack of instructions. Based on the results of the survey, the most important factors affecting acceptance <b>of</b> <b>composting</b> toilets were frequency of using the bulking agent as it contributes to ensure correct process <b>of</b> <b>composting,</b> the experience <b>of</b> final <b>compost</b> application, understanding process <b>of</b> <b>composting</b> and having an off-farm activity.

2500|$|With {{the growth}} in {{biological}} farming practices becoming more common throughout the Australia, traditional synthetic based fertilisers are replaced {{by the use of}} organic fertilisers in the form <b>of</b> <b>compost</b> and soil conditioners. Compost can improve overall soil health when incorporated into the soil or surface-applied as a soil conditioner. Despite differing in nutrient requirements, crops such as wheat, barley, oats, maize, canola, lucerne, fruit trees, grapes, sugar cane and much more can all benefit from the addition of pasteurised and composted organic materials. Compost can improve the soil’s physical, biological and chemical properties and positively enhance actively growing crops. Australian farmers are leading the way in the [...] of organic materials both above and below the soil surface. This continued used of composted organics completes the law of return cycle in the soil food chain, where nutrients removed through the plants, are returned to the soil.|$|E

60|$|The {{pigs and}} poultry were already {{at work on the}} game that was so liberally thrown in their way, and Mark felt indebted to these {{scavengers}} for aiding him in what he perceived was now a task indispensable to his comfort. After going to the ship, and breaking his fast, he returned to the crater, obtained a wheelbarrow, and set to work in earnest to collect the fish, which a very few hours' exposure to the sun of that climate would render so offensive as to make the island next to intolerable. Never in his life did our young friend work harder than he did all that morning. Each load of fish, as it was-wheeled into the crater, was thrown into a trench already prepared for that purpose, and the ashes were hauled over it, by means of the hoe. Feeling the necessity of occupation to lessen his sorrow, {{as well as that of}} getting rid of pestilence, which he seriously apprehended from this inroad of animal substances, Mark toiled two whole days at this work, until fairly driven from it by the intolerable effluvium which arose, notwithstanding all he had done, on every side of the island. It is impossible to say what would have been consequences had not the birds come, in thousands, to his relief. They made quick work of it, clearing off the fish in numbers that would be nearly incredible. As it was, however, our young hermit was driven into the ship, where-he passed a whole week, the steadiness of the trades driving the disagreeable odours to leeward. At the end of that time he ventured ashore, where he found it possible to remain, though the Reef did not get purified for more than a month. Finding a great many fish still remaining that neither hog nor bird would touch, Mark made a couple of voyages to Loam Island, whence he brought two cargoes of the deposit, and landed at the usual place. This he wheeled about the Reef, throwing two or three-shovels full on each offensive creature, thus getting rid of the effluvium and preparing a considerable store of excellent manure for his future husbandry. It may be as well said here, that, at odd times, he threw these little deposits into large heaps, and subsequently wheeled them into the crater, where they were mixed with the principal pile <b>of</b> <b>compost</b> that had now been, for months, collecting there.|$|E
