5|$|A. ocellatus is {{native to}} Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil, and French Guiana, and occurs in the Amazon River basin, along the Amazon, Içá, Negro, Solimões, and Ucayali River systems, {{and also in the}} Approuague and Oyapock River drainages. In its natural environment, the species {{typically}} occurs in slow-moving white-water habitats, and has been observed sheltering under submerged branches. Feral populations also occur in China, northern Australia, and Florida, USA as a byproduct of the <b>ornamental</b> <b>fish</b> trade. The species is limited in its distribution by its intolerance of cooler water temperatures, the lower lethal limit for the species is 12.9°C (55.22°F).|$|E
5|$|Like other animals, fish {{suffer from}} {{diseases}} and parasites. To prevent disease {{they have a}} variety of defenses. Non-specific defenses include the skin and scales, as well as the mucus layer secreted by the epidermis that traps and inhibits the growth of microorganisms. If pathogens breach these defenses, fish can develop an inflammatory response that increases blood flow to the infected region and delivers white blood cells that attempt to destroy pathogens. Specific defenses respond to particular pathogens recognised by the fish's body, i.e., an immune response. In recent years, vaccines have become widely used in aquaculture and also with <b>ornamental</b> <b>fish,</b> for example furunculosis vaccines in farmed salmon and koi herpes virus in koi.|$|E

There is, however, no information on the relative abundance or areas of abundance of different species of <b>ornamental</b> <b>fishes</b> from different islands. There is considerable demand for live <b>ornamental</b> <b>fishes</b> in several countries (Tomey 1985, 1986) and the present export market price of each fish, depending on the species, ranges from Rs. 16. 10 to Rs. 272. 25 {{with an average of}} Rs. 90. 60 in Netherlands and from Rs. 4. 96 to Rs. 148 with an average of Rs. 34. 85 in South East Asian Countries. In West Germany, each specimen of some of the species of <b>ornamental</b> <b>fishes</b> from India can fetch from Rs. 99 to Rs. 810 (Anon 1986). In view of the demand for the <b>ornamental</b> <b>fishes</b> and the possible earning of foreign exchange through export of live <b>ornamental</b> <b>fishes</b> and also in view of the lack of adequate information on distribution and abundance of different species in different islands, a survey was conducted during January-March 1987 and the results with reference to <b>ornamental</b> <b>fishes</b> are presented here...|$|R

2500|$|Metronidazole [...] {{is widely}} used to treat infections of Giardia in dogs, cats, and other {{companion}} animals, although it does not reliably clear infection with this organism and is being supplanted by fenbendazole for this purpose in dogs and cats. It is also used {{for the management of}} chronic inflammatory bowel disease in cats and dogs. Another common usage is the treatment of systemic and/or gastrointestinal clostridial infections in horses. Metronidazole is used in the aquarium hobby to treat <b>ornamental</b> <b>fish</b> and as a broad-spectrum treatment for bacterial and protozoan infections in reptiles and amphibians. In general, the veterinary community may use metronidazole for any potentially susceptible anaerobic infection. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration suggests it only be used when necessary because it {{has been shown to be}} carcinogenic in mice and rats, as well as the microbes for which it is prescribed, and resistance can develop.|$|E
2500|$|Anthias {{are members}} of the family Serranidae (basses, basslets, groupers) and make up the {{subfamily}} Anthiinae. They are widespread in tropical waters. They have been called the [...] "quintessential reef fish", and make up a sizeable portion of the colourful fishes seen swarming in coral reef photography. Anthias are mostly small, peaceful, beautiful and popular as <b>ornamental</b> <b>fish.</b> They are mainly zooplankton feeders. Anthias shoal and school in large numbers, operating more intimate [...] "harems" [...] within the schools. These harems contain a dominant and colourful male, between 2 and 12 females — who operate a hierarchy among themselves — and one or two [...] "subdominant" [...] males, often less brightly coloured and non-territorial. Within the swarm of females, territorial males perform acrobatic U-swim displays and vigorously defend an area of the reef and its associated harem. Anthias are protogynous hermaphrodites. All anthias are born female; if a dominant male perishes, the largest female of the group will often change into a male to take its place. This may lead to squabbling between the next largest male and the transforming female, whose hormones are now surging with testosterone. This can turn quite vicious in the limited confines of captivity.|$|E
40|$|The {{coastal area}} of Baron, Kukup, and Krakal in the {{southern}} coast of Yogyakarta is an arid and dried area, and marginal agriculture land. The potential vegetation resources only live on the lands that produce cassava, corn, peanut, and soybean. The increasing benefits of sea products such as fishes {{still need to be}} invented. The aims of this research are to inventories and to increase the use of disadvantage resources. This research was conducted from October 1995 to March 1996. The result invents 70 species of useful plants and 21 species of weed that can be used by the people for the needs of their own households. The remainder products of Anona squamosa L., which might easily rot and until now unprofitable, could be used to make some jam. Phylantus emblica L. can be put into a useful product by making them to become candies. Another natural resources that are neglected are the cattle excrement and sharkskin. All kind of sharkskin’s can be manufactured into leather products. While cattle excrement can be produced methane for cooking and lighting. There are 163 species of <b>ornamental</b> <b>fishes</b> in Kukup, and 20 species of consumed fishes in Baron.

40|$|Millions {{of marine}} <b>ornamental</b> <b>fishes</b> are traded every year. Today, {{over half of}} the known nearly 4000 coral reef fish species are in trade with poor or no {{monitoring}} and demand is increasing. This study investigates their trade into and through Switzerland by analyzing import documents for live animals. In 2009, 151 import declarations with attached species lists for marine <b>ornamental</b> <b>fishes</b> from non-EU countries totaled 28   356 specimens. The 62 % of the fishes remaining in Switzerland, comprised 440 marine species from 45 families, the rest transited to EU and non-EU countries. Despite the recognized large trade volume for the European region, due to bilateral agreements, no data is collected for imports from the EU. However, inferred data shows that more than 200   000 marine <b>ornamental</b> <b>fishes</b> could be imported into Switzerland every year and an unknown quantity re-exported. As biggest import region, it is therefore safe to assume, that the European region is importing at least as many marine <b>ornamental</b> <b>fishes</b> as the US. There is no adequate data-collecting system known to be in place in any country for monitoring this trade. The EU Trade Control and Expert System (TRACES) to monitor animal diseases could be adjusted to gather compulsory information for the EU and Switzerland. More than half of the species imported into Switzerland are not assessed by the IUCN and therefore marked as ‘not evaluated’ on the Red List. Overall, 70 % of all known coral reef fish species have not been evaluated. If coral reef fishes are threatened or endangered due to large, possibly unsustainable numbers traded, it may be rational to monitor the trade in these species through the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES) ...|$|R

There is a growing global interest to rear the fishes in captivity. But problem due to bacteria and fungi are the major hitch in captive condition. Since, the use of antibiotics is banned, {{an attempt was made}} to ascertain in vitro assay of the neem leaves extract against the bacterial pathogens isolated from infected fishes. Bacterial strains isolated from infected regions of the clown fishes Amphiprion sebae and A. ocellaris were identified as Aeromonas hydrophila, Enterobacter sp., E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus sp., Streptococcus sp., Vibrio cholerae, V. alginolyticus, V. parahaemolyticus and Yersinia enterocolitica. Ethanol and methanol extracts were highly inhibitory to the bacterial isolates when compared to other solvents. Ethanol extracts exhibited low minimum inhibitory concentration (75 - 250 µg ml- 1) as compared to other extracts.
