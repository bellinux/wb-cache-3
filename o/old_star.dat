5|$|The {{development}} of the town was accelerated by {{the opening of the}} railway station in 1839 which stimulated the local economy and was key to the {{development of}} the Star Brewery. Initially Eastern Counties Railway services operated between Mile End and Romford, with extensions to Brentwood and to Shoreditch in 1840. A second station was opened on South Street in 1892 by the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway on the line to Upminster and Grays, giving Romford a rail connection to Tilbury Docks. The two stations were combined into one in 1934. Light industry slowly developed, reaching a peak in the 1970s with a number of factories on the edge of town, such as the Roneo Vickers office machinery company, Colvern manufacturers of wireless components, May's Sheet Metal Works and brush manufacturers Betterware. Suburban expansion increased the population and reinforced Romford's position as a significant regional town centre. The Liberty Shopping Centre was constructed in the 1960s, and has been modernised and supplemented with further shopping centres throughout the town, including The Mall, opened in 1990 (as 'Liberty 2'); and The Brewery, opened in 2000 on the site of the <b>old</b> <b>Star</b> Brewery.|$|E

500|$|Another actress to {{join the}} show was Academy Award winner Whoopi Goldberg, {{who had been a}} long-time Star Trek fan. She {{credited}} Nichelle Nichols as Uhura in The Original Series as an inspiration, saying [...] "Well, when I was nine years <b>old</b> <b>Star</b> Trek came on, I looked at it and I went screaming through the house, 'Come here, mum, everybody, come quick, come quick, there's a black lady on television and she ain't no maid!' I knew right then and there I could be anything I wanted to be." [...] To appear on the show, Goldberg contacted the producers initially through LeVar Burton. The producers did not believe her as they felt that a movie star such as Goldberg would not want to appear in Star Trek, and ignored calls from her agent, until Goldberg called them personally. A meeting was arranged between her and Rick Berman, and she agreed to appear in six episodes of season two. Her character, Guinan, was named after Mary [...] "Texas" [...] Guinan, a prohibition-era speakeasy owner.|$|E
500|$|Eidelman {{stated that}} he finds science fiction the most {{interesting}} and exciting genre to compose for, and that Meyer told him to treat the film as a fresh start, rather than drawing on <b>old</b> <b>Star</b> Trek themes. Eidelman wanted the music to aid the visuals; for Rura Penthe, he strove to create an atmosphere that reflected the alien and dangerous setting, introducing exotic instruments for color. Besides using percussion from around the world, Eidelman treated the choir as percussion, with the Klingon language translation for [...] "to be, or not to be" [...] ("taH pagh, taHbe") being repeated in the background. Spock's theme {{was designed to be}} an ethereal counterpart to the motif for Kirk and the Enterprise, aimed at capturing [...] "the emotional gleam in the captain's eye". Kirk's internal dilemma about what the future holds was echoed in the main theme: [...] "It's Kirk taking control one last time and as he looks out into the stars he has the spark again [...] But there's an unresolved note, because it's very important that he doesn't trust the Klingons. He doesn't want to go on this trip even though the spark is there that overtook him." [...] For the climactic battle, Eidelman starts the music quietly, building the intensity as the battle progresses.|$|E
500|$|Several {{actors were}} cast in roles which recurred {{throughout}} the seven seasons {{on television and}} into the four feature films. Majel Barrett, referred to as [...] "The First Lady of Star Trek" [...] due to her marriage with Roddenberry, appeared both {{as the voice of}} Starfleet computers and as Lwaxana Troi. The part of Lwaxana was specifically created for her. She had appeared in The Original Series and two Star Trek films as Christine Chapel, and as Number One in the original pilot [...] "". John de Lancie was cast as Q despite missing his first audition as it conflicted with a play he was in at the time. A second audition was arranged, where de Lancie impressed Roddenberry, who told him that [...] "You make my words sound better than they are." [...] Colm Meaney was originally cast as an unnamed Ensign in [...] "Encounter at Farpoint", but was subsequently cast as the Transporter Chief Miles O'Brien, appearing in 52 episodes in that role. Whoopi Goldberg approached the producers and asked for a role in the show, resulting in Roddenberry writing her the part of Guinan. She credits Nichelle Nichols as Uhura in The Original Series as inspiring her, saying [...] "when I was nine years <b>old</b> <b>Star</b> Trek came on, I looked at it and I went screaming through the house, 'Come here, mom, everybody, come quick, come quick, there's a black lady on television and she ain't no maid!'

40|$|Recently {{the search}} for the <b>oldest</b> <b>stars</b> have started to focus on the Bulge region. The Galactic bulge hosts {{extremely}} <b>old</b> <b>stars,</b> with ages compatible with the ages of the <b>oldest</b> halo <b>stars.</b> The data coming from these recent observations present new chemical signatures and therefore provide complementary constraints to those already found in the halo. So, the study of the <b>oldest</b> bulge <b>stars</b> can improve dramatically the constraints on the nature of first stars and how they polluted the pristine ISM of our Galaxy. We present our first results regarding the light elements (CNO) and the neutron capture elements. Our findings in the <b>oldest</b> bulge <b>stars</b> support the scenario where the first stellar generations have been fast rotators.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the attenuation law seen through an interstellar medium (ISM) with clumpy spatial distributions {{of stars and}} dust. The clumpiness of the dust distribution is introduced by a multi-phase ISM model. We solve a set of radiative transfer equations with multiple anisotropic scatterings through the clumpy ISM in a 1 -D plane-parallel geometry by using the mega-grain approximation, in which dusty clumps are regarded as very large particles (i. e. mega-grains). The clumpiness of the stellar distribution is introduced by the youngest stars embedded in the clumps. We assume a smooth spatial distribution for <b>older</b> <b>stars.</b> The youngest stars are surrounded by denser dusty gas and suffer stronger attenuation than diffuse <b>older</b> <b>stars</b> (i. e. age-selective attenuation). The apparent attenuation law is a composite of the attenuation laws for the clumpy younger stars and for the diffuse <b>older</b> <b>stars</b> with a luminosity weight. In general, the stellar population dominating the luminosity changes from <b>older</b> <b>stars</b> to younger stars as the wavelength decreases. This makes the attenuation law steep; the composite attenuation rapidly increases from small attenuation for <b>older</b> <b>stars</b> at a long wavelength to large attenuation for younger stars at a short wavelength. The resultant attenuation law of normal disc galaxies {{is expected to be}} much steeper than that of starburst galaxies observed by Calzetti et al. Finally, the Calzetti's attenuation law is regarded as a special case with a large density in our framework. Comment: MNRAS accepted, 13 pages, 14 figure...|$|R
