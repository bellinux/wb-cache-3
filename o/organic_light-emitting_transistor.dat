40|$|The {{realization}} of <b>organic</b> <b>light-emitting</b> <b>transistors</b> (OLETs) with high quantum efficiency and fast switching time {{is crucial for}} the development of highly integrated organic optoelectronic systems. In order to reach such a goal, fabrication of devices with ambipolar transport and high charge mobility values is needed. At present, organic materials having intrinsically ambipolar transport are restricted in number and show poor performance. This limits their use in efficient and fast switching single layer ambipolar OLETs. In this framework, we have taken the approach of combining p-type and n-type materials in two complementary configurations. The first one is based on realizing layered structures (bi-layer heterojunction) where materials are sequentially deposited. The second one is based on simultaneously evaporating two materials with variable composition (bulk heterojunction) to form a mixed film. In this paper, the charge transport and electroluminescence properties of OLETs based on these heterostructures are presented. A correlation between the active layer structure and the electrical performances has been obtained by means of laser scanning confocal microscopy, here employed for morphology and spectroscopy analysis. Differences between the two approaches are critically discussed. ...|$|R

Time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy reveals that the phase segregation of the two molecules in the bulk heterojunction and their electronic interaction determine the optoelectronic properties of the devices.

In this thesis project, I tried to achieve an efficient electron transport and injection properties in opto-electronic devices, using inorganic n-type metal oxides (MOs) instead of organic n-type materials and a polyethyleneimine ethoxylated (PEIE) thin layer as electron transport (ETLs) and injection layers (EILs), respectively. In {{the first part of}} this thesis, inverted OLEDs were fabricated in order to study the effect of the PEIE layer in-between ZnO and two different emissive layers (EMLs) : poly(9, 9 -dioctylfluorene-alt-benzothiadiazole) polymer (F 8 BT) and tris(8 -hydroxyquinolinato) aluminum small molecule (Alq 3), based on a solution and thermal evaporation processes, respectively. Different concentrations (0. 80 %, 0. 40 %) of PEIE layers were used to further study electron injection capability in OLEDs. After a series of optimizations in the fabrication process, the opto-electrical characterization showed high-performance of devices. The inverted OLEDs reported a maximum luminance over 104 cd m- 2 and a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) around 1. 11 %. The results were attributed to the additional PEIE layer which provided a good electron injection from MOs into EMLs. In the last part of the thesis, OLETs were fabricated and discussed by directly transferring the energy modification layer from OLEDs to OLETs.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of combining different functionalities {{in a single}} device is of great relevance for further development of organic electronics in integrated components and circuitry. <b>Organic</b> <b>light-emitting</b> <b>transistors</b> (OLETs) have been demonstrated {{to be able to}} combine in a single device the electrical switching functionality of a field-effect transistor and the capability of light generation. A novel strategy in OLET realization is the tri-layer vertical hetero-junction. This configuration is similar to the bi-layer except for the presence of a new middle layer between the two transport layers. This “recombination” layer presents high emission quantum efficiency and OLED-like (<b>Organic</b> <b>Light-Emitting</b> Diode) vertical bulk mobility value. The key idea of the vertical tri-layer hetero-junction approach in realizing OLETs is that each layer has to be optimized according to its specific function (charge transport, energy transfer, radiative exciton recombination). Clearly, matching the overall device characteristics with the functional properties of the single materials composing the active region of the OFET, is a great challenge that requires a deep investigation of the morphological, optical and electrical features of the system. As {{in the case of the}} bi-layer based OLETs, it is clear that the interfaces between the dielectric and the bottom transport layer and between the recombination and the top transport layer are crucial for guaranteeing good ambipolar field-effect electrical characteristics. Moreover interfaces between the bottom transport and the recombination layer and between the recombination and the top transport layer should provide the favourable conditions for the charge percolation to happen in the recombination layer and form excitons. Organic light emitting transistor based on the tri-layer approach with external quantum efficiency out-performing the OLED state of the art has been recently demonstrated [Capelli et al., Nat. Mater. 9 (2010) 496 - 503] widening the scientific and technological interest in this field of research. ...|$|R

Among the other, <b>Organic</b> <b>Light-Emitting</b> <b>Transistors</b> (OLETs) are emerging as an innovative class of multifunctional devices able to integrate the electronic properties of a transistor and the light generation capability. In this thesis, we aim at investigating the photonic and optoelectronic performance of suitable-engineered devices based on different field-effect transistors architecture. Both the active layer and the gate dielectric layer of the device were investigated in order to increase the device performance in terms of brightness, color coordinate and external quantum efficiency. Starting from the study of the active layer in an ambipolar single-layer OLET, we succeeded in controlling the solid-state phases of the oligothiophene derivative namely NT 4 N. By means of three different deposition techniques (thermal sublimation, supersonic molecular beam deposition, lithographically controlled wetting) we investigated the influence of the different molecular packing motifs on the field-effect charge mobility. Given the limited number of efficient electroluminescent organic small molecules with high field-effect charge mobility, we adopted another approach for enhancing the figures of merit of OLET devices by implementing a multilayer heterostructure comprised by a charge-transport layer and a light-emitting layer. By introducing a newly-synthetized anthracene-based twisted oligomer as emissive layer a deep blue emitting unipolar OLET was realized.

40|$|Organic {{semiconductors}} are {{the fundamental}} constituents {{of a novel}} class of (opto-) electronic devices. In particular {{organic light emitting diodes}} (OLED) evolved rapidly during recent years. Another promising technological strategy is the implementation of multifunction organic field-effect <b>transistors,</b> in particular, <b>organic</b> <b>light-emitting</b> <b>transistors</b> (OLET). OLEDs suffer from exciton quenching by interaction with the externally applied electric-field and with charge-injection contacts. In optimized ambipolar OLETs on the other hand, light generation takes place in the transistor channel, well separated from the electrodes and in the presence of small effective electric fields. OLETs, like other field-effect devices, support high charge densities, which could lead to exciton-quenching by exciton-charge interaction. This process has been neglected by idealized OLET-models, as they assume an infinitely small recombination zone width. However, was experimentally demonstrated that OLETs present a recombination zone width in the range of several micro-meters. Exciton-charge interaction has surely {{to be taken into account}} in real devices. This thesis presents a comprehensive investigation on excitonic processes in organic field-effect devices, like OLETs. In particular two main issues were investigated: (i) the physical mechanism of exciton-charge interaction and (ii) the charge-distribution within the transistor channel. As model compounds for these investigations the oligomer semiconductors PTCDI-C 13 and T 4 dim were chosen. The former is a good electron transport (n-type) material with interesting emission efficiency, while the latter is a newly synthesized ambipolar transport material. As no conclusive investigations on their photophysics were available in literature, at first a fundamental characterization of their photophysical processes in technologically-relevant thin-film substrates was carried out. Exciton quenching was investigated in field-effect structures by static and dynamic Photoluminescence Electro-Modulated (PLEM) measurements. It could be demonstrated that only exciton-charge interaction is a relevant source for exciton quenching in field-effect devices. This process was described by a diffusion-limited interaction model, which had to be corrected in order to account for the initial exciton distribution. As the observed PLEM only depends on the charges present in the device, it can be used as direct probe for the charge-density distribution. Based on this consideration a microscopy technique was implemented that allows the direct measurement of the charge distribution in organic transistors. The working principles of this technique are demonstrated on PTCDI-C 13 and T 4 dim OFETs. In particular, for the ambipolar light-emitting molecule a recombination zone could be observed in working devices. The measured position of the recombination zone was used to test two well-established models proposed to describe the recombination zone in OLETs.

40|$|The π-π {{interactions}} between organic molecules {{are among the}} most important parameters for optimizing the transport and optical properties of <b>organic</b> <b>transistors,</b> <b>light-emitting</b> diodes, and (bio-) molecular devices. Despite substantial theoretical progress, direct experimental measurement of the π-π electronic coupling energy parameter t has remained an old challenge due to molecular structural variability and the large number of parameters that affect the charge transport. Here, we propose a study of π-π interactions from electrochemical and current measurements on a large array of ferrocene-thiolated gold nanocrystals. We confirm the theoretical prediction that t can be assessed from a statistical analysis of current histograms. The extracted value of t ca. 35 meV is in the expected range based on our density functional theory analysis. Furthermore, the t distribution is not necessarily Gaussian and could be used as an ultrasensitive technique to assess intermolecular distance fluctuation at the subangström level. The present work establishes a direct bridge between quantum chemistry, electrochemistry, organic electronics, and mesoscopic physics, all of which were used to discuss results and perspectives in a quantitative manner.
