On 17 October, Harada formed part of the escort for a force of torpedo bombers which were attempting to attack targets on Guadalcanal. American Grumman F4F Wildcats attacked this force, and while Harada probably downed a Wildcat, his aircraft was badly damaged. His plane crash-landed near the Japanese base at Rekata Bay on Santa Isabel Island, and Harada had to dig himself <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>underneath</b> the wreckage of his plane with his bare hands. Harada was later returned to Japan on board a hospital ship.|$|E
25|$|The {{most basic}} {{feature is the}} {{integrated}} bidet, a nozzle {{the size of a}} pencil that comes <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>underneath</b> the toilet seat and squirts water. It has two settings: one for washing the anus and one for the bidet. The former is called posterior wash, general use, or family cleaning, and the latter is known as feminine cleaning, feminine wash or simply bidet. At no point does the nozzle actually touch the body of the user. The nozzle is also self-cleaning and cleans itself before and after operation. The user can select to wash the anus or vulva by pressing the corresponding button on the control panel. Usually the same nozzle is used for both operations, but at a different position of the nozzle head, and using different openings in the nozzle to squirt water at a different angle to aim for the correct spot. Occasionally, two nozzles are used, each dedicated for one area. The control logic is also attached to a pressure switch or a proximity sensor in the toilet seat, and operates only when the seat is occupied. The very first models did not include this automatic switch-off. A number of curious users pressed the button while watching the toilet to see its mode of operation, and promptly received a jet of warm water in their faces.|$|E
500|$|The second attack {{occurred}} on June 20, 1832, {{two weeks after}} the first incident. [...] In the attack, a large Sauk war party attacked Blue Mounds and two members of the militia, Emerson Green and George Force, were killed. Eyewitness accounts estimated the size of the group between 50-100 warriors. The night before the second attack of June 20 strange noises were heard {{in the vicinity of the}} fort. Force and Green had left the fort, on horseback, to investigate the previous night's disturbances and were several miles east of Fort Blue Mounds when they came across Black Hawk's band, guided to the fort by sympathetic Ho-Chunk. Force was killed immediately but Green broke for the fort and almost made it back to safety when, in view of the fort's occupants, his horse was shot <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>underneath</b> him. Green was surrounded by the war party and killed, eyewitness accounts indicate that his body was badly mutilated.|$|E

500|$|Stalingrads hull was towed from Nikolayev on 19 May 1955 {{by three}} tugs, but was driven ashore by high winds on 23 May at the {{southern}} entrance to Sevastopol Bay. She grounded on a very rocky bottom in very shallow water only about [...] from shore. A number of the ordinary methods to refloat a ship couldn't be used because she was very nearly empty and so nothing could be off-loaded and the rocky bottom meant that it couldn't be excavated <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>underneath</b> her. The first attempt used brute force provided by the cruisers [...] and Kerch to unsuccessfully tow her off. Several other attempts were made using explosive charges to create shock waves that would pivot her stern into deeper water in combination with tugs attempting to pull her around, but these were counterproductive in that several holes were blown in her sides which flooded several compartments and grounded her that much more firmly. At this time a more detailed assessment {{was made of the}} situation and 259 steel projections were discovered on the underside of her hull, left over from her launching cradles. These ranged in length from [...] and totally invalidated all calculations about the amount of force required to free her.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1970s and 1980s {{trends in}} the {{worldwide}} market favored fruitier, less tannic wines that could be consumed at a younger age. A group of Barolo producers, led by the house of Ceretto, Paolo Cordero di Montezemolo, Elio Altare, and Renato Ratti, started making more modern, international styles of Barolos by using shorter periods for maceration (days as opposed to weeks) and fermentation (usually 4872 hours or at most 810 days), less time aging in new small oak barrels and {{an extended period of}} bottle aging prior to release. By using modern technology, including specialized tanks that allow the wine to be pumped <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>underneath</b> the cap of skins and then pumped over, they found ways to maximize color extraction and minimize harsh tannins. Prior to this [...] "modernist" [...] movement, Nebbiolo was often harvested slightly unripe and at high yields which left the grapes with harsh green tannins that had not had time to fully polymerize. To maximize color extraction, producers would subject the wine to extended periods of maceration, taking up to several weeks, and then several years aging in large oak casks to soften the wine. Through the long slow process of oxidation, the perception of tannins would lessen (such as occurs when decanting wine), but the fruit would also fade and become oxidized. The decline in fruit would {{no longer be able to}} balance the remaining harsh tannins, leaving a bitter, astringent wine with withered fruit. To counter this change, some producers would blend in other grape varieties such as Arneis and Barbera to add color, fruit or softness to the wine.|$|E

2500|$|No crater {{should be}} expected. The 10,000-pound thrust Descent Propulsion System was {{throttled}} very far down {{during the final}} landing. The Lunar Module was no longer quickly decelerating, so the descent engine only had to support the lander's own weight, which was lessened by the Moon's gravity and by the near exhaustion of the descent propellants. At landing, the engine thrust divided by the nozzle exit area is only about 10 kilopascals (1.5 PSI). Beyond the engine nozzle, the plume spreads, and the pressure drops very quickly. Rocket exhaust gasses expand much more quickly after leaving the engine nozzle in a vacuum than in an atmosphere. The effect of an atmosphere on rocket plumes can be easily seen in launches from Earth; as the rocket rises through the thinning atmosphere, the exhaust plumes broaden very noticeably. To lessen this, rocket engines made for vacuums have longer bells than those made for use on Earth, but they still cannot stop this spreading. The lander's exhaust gasses, therefore, expanded quickly well beyond the landing site. The descent engines did scatter {{a lot of very}} fine surface dust as seen in 16mm movies of each landing, and many mission commanders spoke of its effect on visibility. The landers were generally moving horizontally as well as vertically, and photos do show scouring of the surface along the final descent path. Finally, the lunar regolith is very compact below its surface dust layer, making it impossible for the descent engine to blast out a [...] "crater". A blast crater was measured under the Apollo 11 lander using shadow lengths of the descent engine bell and estimates of the amount that the landing gear had compressed and how deep the lander footpads had pressed into the lunar surface and {{it was found that the}} engine had eroded between 4 and 6 inches of regolith <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>underneath</b> the engine bell during the final descent and landing.|$|E
