5|$|Burial 278 {{was that}} of an infant, {{deposited}} in a cist under the floor of Terrace 1 Structure 5 in the acropolis. It was unaccompanied by any offering, the few ceramic fragments found associated with the cist were dated to the Late Classic Period. The remains were laid out <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>back,</b> with the skull oriented to the south.|$|E
5|$|Burial 69 {{was found}} {{in front of the}} base of Group 18 Structure 2. The remains were {{extremely}} poorly preserved but the deceased may have been laid out <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>back</b> with the head towards the north. Associated funerary offerings included a tripod plate, a polychrome vase and a flint projectile point. The burial was securely dated to the Late Classic.|$|E
5|$|The Danube crested newt's {{back and}} sides are dark brown with black spots and white stippling. The belly is orange to red (in other crested newts, {{it is usually}} yellow or orange–yellow), with small or {{medium-sized}} black blotches that have sharp edges. Like all crested newts, T.dobrogicus males develop a crest <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>back</b> and tail during breeding phase, which can be quite high and jagged and usually starts between the eyes and nostrils. Another feature of males at breeding season is a bluish-white stripe along the tail.|$|E

5|$|The player gains {{points by}} {{defeating}} multiple enemies consecutively and {{can participate in}} a bonus round to gain more points. Enemies are defeated by kicking them over once they have been flipped <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>back.</b> This is accomplished by hitting the platform the enemy is on directly beneath them. If the player allows too much time to pass after doing this, the enemy will flip itself back over, changing in color and increasing speed. Each phase has {{a certain number of}} enemies, with the final enemy immediately changing color and increasing to maximum speed. Hitting a flipped enemy from underneath causes it to right itself and start moving again, but it does not change speed or color.|$|E
5|$|Sharks figure {{prominently}} in Hawaiian mythology. Stories tell {{of men with}} shark jaws <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>back</b> who could change between shark and human form. A common theme was that a shark-man would warn beach-goers of sharks in the waters. The beach-goers would laugh and ignore the warnings and get eaten by the shark-man who warned them. Hawaiian mythology also includes many shark gods. Among a fishing people, {{the most popular of}} all aumakua, or deified ancestor guardians, are shark aumakua. Kamaku describes in detail how to offer a corpse to become a shark. The body transforms gradually until the kahuna can point the awe-struck family to the markings on the shark's body that correspond to the clothing in which the beloved's body had been wrapped. Such a shark aumakua becomes the family pet, receiving food, and driving fish into the family net and warding off danger. Like all aumakua it had evil uses such as helping kill enemies. The ruling chiefs typically forbade such sorcery. Many Native Hawaiian families claim such an aumakua, who is known by name to the whole community.|$|E
5|$|According to Haga, the story's main {{theme was}} saving Elena from the curse and then {{returning}} to a normal life. The world design, narrative complexity and number of characters was {{kept to a minimum}} so players would have their attention directed upon the main characters' plight. When developing the characters, Haga wanted players to relate easily to Aeron, and he was developed to become not too outspoken or assertive. The character Elena was present from the beginning of development, but due to the negative feedback of testers, Elena needed to undergo a major overhaul, including redesigning her monster transformation so that players would sympathize better with her condition, and all the dialogue and cutscenes involving her being redone from scratch. As a result of these developments, the character was portrayed as a strong-willed woman {{who did not want to}} be a burden on Aeron despite her condition, in addition to helping him rather than just letting him handle the entire quest. Mavda and her husband were designed to contrast with the relationship between Aeron and Elena: while they looked odd, they were in fact a devoted couple similar to the main protagonists. Her design originated from the initial ideas for the game's merchant, who would have a large pack <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>back.</b> She was compared by Haga to cynical witches found in traditional European fairy tales.|$|E

5|$|The main Monpa festivals held in {{the monastery}} are the Choksar, Losar, Ajilamu, and Torgya. Choksar is the festival when the Lamas recite {{religious}} scriptures in the monasteries. Following the religious recitations, the villagers carry the scriptures <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>back</b> and circumambulate their agricultural land seeking blessings for good yield of crops without any infestations by pests and to protect against attack by wild animals. In the Losar festival, which {{marks the beginning of}} the Tibetan New Year, people visit the monastery and offer prayers. Torgya, also known as Tawang-Torgya, is an annual festival that is exclusively {{held in the}} monastery. It is held according to the Buddhist calendar days of 28th to 30th of Dawachukchipa, which corresponds to 10 to 12 January of the Gregorian calendar, and is a Monpa celebration. The objective of the festival is to ward off evil spirits and ushering all round prosperity and happiness {{to the people in the}} ensuing year. During the three-day festival, dances performed by artists in colorful costumes and masks are held in the courtyard, including the Pha Chan and the Losjker Chungiye, the latter of which is performed by the monks of the monastery. Each dance represents a myth and costumes and masks represent animal forms such as cows, tigers, sheep, monkeys and so forth.|$|E

25|$|The Buddhist Lamas {{would read}} {{religious}} scriptures in the Gompas {{for a few}} days during Choskar. Thereafter, the villagers will walk around the cultivated fields with the sutras <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>back.</b> The significance of this festival is to pray for better cultivation and protect the grains from insects and wild animals. The prosperity of the villagers is not excluded as well.|$|E
25|$|The central square {{space of}} the {{interior}} of the viharas is defined by square columns forming a more or less square open area. Outside this are long rectangular aisles on each side, forming a kind of cloister. Along the side and rear walls are a number of small cells entered by a narrow doorway; these are roughly square, and have small niches <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>back</b> walls. Originally they had wooden doors. The centre of the rear wall has a larger shrine-room behind, containing a large Buddha statue.|$|E

25|$|After a {{successful}} approach, negatively buoyant {{objects such as}} a weight belt are removed. The priority is then to transport the person to the water's edge in preparation for removal from the water. The person is turned <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>back</b> with a secure grip used to tow from behind. If the person is cooperative they may be towed {{in a similar fashion}} held at the armpits. If the person is unconscious they may be pulled in a similar fashion held at the chin and cheeks, ensuring that the mouth and nose are well above the water.|$|E
25|$|The Mystic River Passage {{is a small}} water filled {{passage that}} {{eventually}} opens {{up to the second}} largest room in the cave. The room is called the T Room and is {{in the shape of the}} letter T. The cave extends beyond the T Room, but the passage becomes much smaller and narrower than before. To enter the passage one must lie <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>back</b> and keep their face above the water. The passage is extremely tight and filled with mud and water causing many to call it the “Sewer Pipe.” The end of the passage has not been reached.|$|E
25|$|Leaping and {{arboreal}} insects {{seems like}} a good explanation for this evolutionary process for several reasons. Because early winged insects were lacking the sophisticated wing folding mechanism of neopterous insects, they must {{have lived in the}} open and not been able to hide or search for food under leaves, in cracks, under rocks and other such confined spaces. In these old forests there weren't many open places where insects with huge structures <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>back</b> could have lived without experiencing huge disadvantages. If insects got their wings on land and not in water, which clearly seems to be the case, the tree canopies would be the most obvious place where such gliding structures could have emerged, in a time when the air was a new territory.|$|E

25|$|As the Red defense collapsed, Wilkman was {{now able}} to enter Länkipohja, only {{to be hit by}} their own men as the Aminoff {{battalion}} mistook them as Reds. Finally the Whites took the village at 3 PM as the Reds fled south across the ice of lake Längelmävesi. After Länkipohja was lost, only remaining Reds were now the 300 fighters of Tuusula Red Guard who were still resisting in Vilkkilä. The Wilkman battalion attacked <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>back</b> and the battle was over in the late afternoon. Most of the Reds managed to flee, but about 100 surrendered believing that they were treated like prisoners of war. However, all the surrendered Reds were executed. Leander Viljanen, the commander of the Tuusula Red Guard, hid from the Whites and committed a suicide on the next day.|$|E
25|$|About 90% of {{the time}} sciatica {{is due to a}} spinal disc {{herniation}} pressing on one of the lumbar or sacral nerve roots. Other problems that may result in sciatica include spondylolisthesis, spinal stenosis, piriformis syndrome, pelvic tumors, and compression by a baby's head during pregnancy. The straight-leg-raising test is often helpful in diagnosis. The test is positive if, when the leg is raised while a person is lying <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>back,</b> pain shoots below the knee. In most cases medical imaging is not needed. Exceptions to this are when bowel or bladder function is affected, there is significant loss of feeling or weakness, symptoms are long standing, or there is a concern of a tumor or infection. Conditions that may present similarly are diseases of the hip and early herpes zoster before the rash appears.|$|E
25|$|The Indians were poised with cavalry on both flanks, their center {{comprising}} infantry with War Elephants {{which were}} heavily armored and were strapped {{on with a}} castle-like howdah <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>back</b> carrying a trio of archers and javelin hurlers towering among or before them in equal intervals of fifty feet to defend the vulnerable flanks. All of the War-Elephants were equipped with fire-hardened leather and quilted armor for protection while their foreheads and trunks bore steel-plates to defend against enemy arrows. The Pauravan Army itself was dressed in flamboyantly hued outfits wearing steel helmets, bright scarves and baldrics wielding axes, lances and maces. King Porus, seated atop the tallest War Elephant selected from his elephant corps, himself was not mounted on Howdah, as he wore a remarkable chain mail armor and hence had no need of the additional protection of a tower.|$|E
