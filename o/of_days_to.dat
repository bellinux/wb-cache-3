5|$|In early 1953, the Việt Minh under Võ Nguyên Giáp {{commenced}} {{an invasion}} of Laos to exert additional pressure on Paris and on the French forces stationed in Indochina. In the area of Muong Khoua were the Việt Minh 308th, 312th and 316th divisions, whose long supply lines were maintained by a veritable army of 200,000 porters. The French command—headed then by Raoul Salan—ordered {{the establishment of a}} series of French outposts in northern Laos to resist the Việt Minh invading forces {{for as long as possible}} to buy time for the fortification of Luang Prabang and Vientiane, the capital cities of Laos. The King of Laos, Sisavang Vong, remained in Luang Prabang, which added greater impetus to French efforts. The terrain of northern Laos, and the local climate, isolated many of the outposts with a night-time fog known as crachin, thick jungle, a lack of roads, and steep terrain. Each outpost was given a certain number <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>to</b> withstand Việt Minh forces, including Muong Khoua which was issued orders on April 13 to hold for fourteen days—until April 27.|$|E

25|$|The {{role of the}} two gods at the kalendae {{of every}} month is that of {{presiding}} over {{the birth of the}} new moon. Janus and Juno cooperate as the first looks after the passage from the previous to the ensuing month while the second helps it through the strength of her vitality. The rites of the kalendae included the invocations to Juno Covella, giving the number <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>to</b> the nonae, a sacrifice to Janus by the rex sacrorum and the pontifex minor at the curia Calabra and one to Juno by the regina sacrorum in the Regia: originally when the month was still lunar the pontifex minor had the task of signalling the appearance of the new moon. While the meaning of the epithet Covella is unknown and debated, that of the rituals is clear as the divine couple is supposed to oversee, protect and help the moon during the particularly dangerous time of her darkness and her labours: the role of Juno Covella is hence {{the same as that of}} Lucina for women during parturition. The association of the two gods is reflected on the human level at the difficult time of labours as is apparent in the custom of putting a key, symbol of Janus, in the hand of the woman with the aim of ensuring an easy delivery, while she had to invoke Juno Lucina. At the nonae Caprotinae similarly Juno had the function of aiding and strengthening the moon as the nocturnal light, at the time when her force was supposed to be at its lowest, after the Summer solstice.|$|E

500|$|At {{one point}} in the episode, the Springfield {{residents}} try to set the record for largest human pyramid, which fails when the pyramid collapses, causing the people to roll into a giant ball. According to director Kirkland, the scene, which the staff members refer to as the [...] "people ball", was very difficult to animate, and it [...] "almost gave [...] a migraine" [...] determining how to implement it in the episode. While {{trying to figure out how}} to animate the [...] "people ball", Kirkland spray-painted a globe with white primer and assigned layout artist Paul Wee to draw the Springfield citizens on it with black ink. Normally, the Simpsons animators each draw ten scenes per week, but because he drew the [...] "people ball", Wee was excused from these duties. Since drawing the [...] "people ball" [...] by hand would have [...] "murdered" [...] the animators, they soon decided to photograph it for each frame of the scene. The photographs were taken in Kirkland's garage and were then photocopied using a Xerox photocopier. Executive producer and current showrunner Al Jean stated that the technique for animating the [...] "people ball" [...] was [...] "extremely interesting", [...] although it has never been used again in the series. The [...] "master drawing" [...] of the human pyramid, which Kirkland also stated was very complicated, took animator Matthew Schofield a couple <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>to</b> draw. The drawing then became a reference for the other animators to use when animating the scene.|$|E
