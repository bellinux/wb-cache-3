5|$|The body of {{the coconut}} crab is, like that of all decapods, divided into a front section (cephalothorax), which has 10 legs, and an abdomen. The front-most pair <b>of</b> <b>legs</b> has large chelae (claws), with the left being larger than the right. The next two pairs, as with other hermit crabs, are large, {{powerful}} walking legs with pointed tips, which allow coconut crabs to climb vertical or overhanging surfaces. The fourth pair <b>of</b> <b>legs</b> is smaller with tweezer-like chelae at the end, allowing young coconut crabs to grip {{the inside of a}} shell or coconut husk to carry for protection; adults use this pair for walking and climbing. The last pair <b>of</b> <b>legs</b> is very small and is used by females to tend their eggs, and by the males in mating. This last pair <b>of</b> <b>legs</b> is usually held inside the carapace, in the cavity containing the breathing organs. There is some difference in color between the animals found on different islands, ranging from orange-red to purplish blue; in most regions, blue is the predominant color, but in some places, including the Seychelles, most individuals are red.|$|E
5|$|The thorax is a tagma {{composed}} of three sections, the prothorax, mesothorax and the metathorax. The anterior segment, {{closest to the}} head, is the prothorax, with the major features being the first pair <b>of</b> <b>legs</b> and the pronotum. The middle segment is the mesothorax, with the major features being the second pair <b>of</b> <b>legs</b> and the anterior wings. The third and most posterior segment, abutting the abdomen, is the metathorax, which features the third pair <b>of</b> <b>legs</b> and the posterior wings. Each segment is dilineated by an intersegmental suture. Each segment has four basic regions. The dorsal surface is called the tergum (or notum) to distinguish it from the abdominal terga. The two lateral regions are called the pleura (singular: pleuron) and the ventral aspect is called the sternum. In turn, the notum of the prothorax is called the pronotum, the notum for the mesothorax is called the mesonotum and the notum for the metathorax is called the metanotum. Continuing with this logic, the mesopleura and metapleura, {{as well as the}} mesosternum and metasternum, are used.|$|E
5|$|When receptive, females respond {{similarly}} to both male types: approach and settle; extend the foremost pair <b>of</b> <b>legs</b> or tap with them. Both male morphs typically end their initial display and start leg-clapping and zig-zag dancing.|$|E

The scientific study of millipedes is known as diplopodology, and a scientist who studies them is called a diplopodologist.|$|E

5|$|The {{female worker}} ants {{do not have}} wings and {{reproductive}} females lose their wings after their mating flights in order to begin their colonies.
