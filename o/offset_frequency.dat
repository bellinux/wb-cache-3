25|$|The {{breakthrough}} {{which led}} to a practical frequency comb was the development of technology for stabilizing the carrier–envelope <b>offset</b> <b>frequency.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{are other}} {{applications}} {{that do not}} need to lock the carrier–envelope <b>offset</b> <b>frequency</b> to a radio-frequency signal. These include, among others, optical communications, the synthesis of optical arbitrary waveforms, spectroscopy (especially dual-comb spectroscopy) or radio-frequency photonics.|$|E
25|$|Measurement of the carrier–envelope <b>offset</b> <b>frequency</b> {{is usually}} {{done with a}} self-referencing technique, in which the phase of {{one part of the}} {{spectrum}} is compared to its harmonic. Different possible approaches for carrier–envelope offset phase control were proposed in 1999. The two simplest approaches, which require only one nonlinear optical process, are described in the following.|$|E
30|$|From (4), the {{estimation}} of sampling <b>frequency</b> <b>offset</b> can be translated into {{the estimation}} of carrier <b>frequency</b> <b>offset,</b> {{and the result of}} carrier frequency estimation can be used to compensate both the sampling <b>frequency</b> <b>offset</b> and carrier <b>frequency</b> <b>offset.</b>|$|R
40|$|Here, it {{is shown}} that when two optical {{frequency}} combs with identical mode spacing but different <b>offset</b> <b>frequencies</b> copropagate through a nonlinear optical fiber, four-wave mixing between them generates new modes. Although the spacings {{between the new}} modes depend on the difference of the <b>offset</b> <b>frequencies,</b> they appear irregular {{because of the large}} number of possible four-wave-mixing processes. However, when the difference in the <b>offset</b> <b>frequencies</b> is an integer fraction of the mode spacing of the original combs, the cascaded four-wave mixing generates a new comb with a fixed mode spacing given by the difference in the <b>offset</b> <b>frequencies.</b> This process can be used to substantially increase the mode density of a frequency comb. The method can be used in conjunction with new sources of frequency combs, such as quantum cascade lasers and microresonators, which have large mode spacing of tens of GHz. Decreasing the mode spacing of such sources is likely to increase their applicability...|$|R

25|$|The {{other is}} doing {{experiments}} with few-cycle pulses, like above-threshold ionization, attosecond pulses, highly efficient nonlinear optics or high-harmonics generation. This can be single pulses, {{so that no}} comb exists, and therefore {{it is not possible}} to define a carrier–envelope <b>offset</b> <b>frequency,</b> rather the carrier–envelope offset phase is important. A second photodiode can be added to the setup to gather phase and amplitude in a single shot, or difference-frequency generation can be used to even lock the offset on a single-shot basis, albeit with low power efficiency.|$|E

30|$|The BER of SISO-OFDM systems {{impaired}} by <b>frequency</b> <b>offset</b> is {{analyzed in}} [11], {{in which the}} <b>frequency</b> <b>offset</b> {{is assumed to be}} perfectly known at the receiver, and, based on the intercarrier interference (ICI) analysis, the BER is evaluated for multipath fading channels. Many <b>frequency</b> <b>offset</b> estimators have been proposed [8, 12 – 14]. A synchronization algorithm for MIMO-OFDM systems is proposed in [15], which considers an identical timing <b>offset</b> and <b>frequency</b> <b>offset</b> with respect to each transmit-receive antenna pair. In [10], where <b>frequency</b> <b>offsets</b> for different transmit-receive antennas are assumed to be different, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for either the <b>frequency</b> <b>offsets</b> or channel estimation variance errors for MIMO-OFDM is derived. More documents on MIMO-OFDM channel estimation by considering the <b>frequency</b> <b>offset</b> are available at [16, 17].|$|R
40|$|A {{joint frame}} {{synchronization}} and reversed spectrum signal differentiation method for DRM Plus digital broadcasting systems is proposed. The proposed scheme can detect the fast frame synchronization and determine whether normal spectrum signal or reversed spectrum signal without carrier <b>frequency</b> <b>offset</b> & sampling <b>frequency</b> <b>offset</b> compensation, enabling fast frame synchronization. The proposed method shows outstanding performance in environments where symbol timing <b>offsets</b> and sampling <b>frequency</b> <b>offsets</b> exist...|$|R
30|$|Since {{there is}} no big <b>frequency</b> <b>offset</b> {{difference}} between stations after the coarse <b>frequency</b> <b>offset</b> synchronization, the inter-carrier-interference (ICI) term caused by the residual <b>frequency</b> <b>offset</b> is ignored for the simplicity in (1) whereas the accumulated phase rotation term caused by <b>frequency</b> <b>offset</b> is still included.|$|R
2500|$|In Ti:sapphire lasers using prisms for {{dispersion}} control, the carrier–envelope <b>offset</b> <b>frequency</b> can {{be controlled}} by tilting the high reflector mirror {{at the end of}} the prism pair. [...] This can be done using piezoelectric transducers.|$|E
2500|$|An {{alternative}} to stabilizing the carrier–envelope <b>offset</b> <b>frequency</b> is to cancel it completely {{by use of}} difference frequency generation (DFG). If the difference frequency of light of opposite ends of a broadened spectrum is generated in a nonlinear crystal, the resulting frequency comb is carrier–envelope offset-free since the two spectral parts contributing to the DFG share the same carrier–envelope <b>offset</b> <b>frequency.</b> This was first proposed in 1999 [...] and recently demonstrated using an erbium fiber frequency comb at the telecom wavelength. This simple approach has the advantage that no electronic feedback loop is needed as in conventional stabilization techniques. It promises to be more robust and stable against environmental perturbations.|$|E
2500|$|Alternatively, difference-frequency {{generation}} (DFG) can be used. From {{light of}} {{opposite ends of}} the broadened spectrum the difference frequency is generated in a nonlinear crystal, and a heterodyne beat between this mixing product and light at the same wavelength of the original spectrum is measured. [...] This beat frequency, detectable with a photodiode, is the carrier–envelope <b>offset</b> <b>frequency.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of clock <b>frequency</b> <b>offset</b> between {{transmitter and receiver}} of IR UWB (Impulse Radio Ultra Wide Band) system is talked about in this study. Firstly, this study highlight the fact that clock <b>frequency</b> <b>offset</b> in UWB system will decrease {{the performance of the}} coherent receiver and then the necessity of <b>frequency</b> <b>offset</b> estimation before acquisition step is stated. To improve the acquisition failure situation caused by <b>frequency</b> <b>offset,</b> a new acquisition structure with <b>frequency</b> <b>offset</b> estimation, as well as a new method to estimate <b>frequency</b> <b>offset,</b> is proposed. The scheme employs the characteristics of the symmetry and linearity of correlation to approximate the <b>frequency</b> <b>offset</b> in a range of searching area and has good accuracy. As the simulation results reveal, the proposed acquisition structure with <b>frequency</b> <b>offset</b> estimation outperforms the traditional acquisition system and the acquisition failure caused by <b>frequency</b> <b>offset</b> is improved greatly...|$|R

The performance of an OFDM system is degraded by both the <b>Frequency</b> <b>Offset</b> and the Phase Offset. The degradation of Bit Error Rate (BER) caused {{by the presence of}} Phase <b>Offset</b> and <b>Frequency</b> <b>Offset</b> is analytically evaluated. Hence, closed form expressions are derived to compute the BER with Rayleigh, Weibull and Nakagami fading channels assuming Gaussian probability density function of the <b>Frequency</b> <b>Offset</b> and Phase Offset. BER performance results are evaluated numerically following the analytical approach...|$|R
3000|$|... {{contains}} the column scaling ambiguity Λ, it is immaterial for estimating {{the timing and}} <b>frequency</b> <b>offset</b> of each user. It is because the timing and <b>frequency</b> <b>offset</b> of each user is obtained by phase differential term. Therefore, the scaling effect on the matrix is diminished. In addition, each timing <b>offset</b> with <b>frequency</b> <b>offset</b> is even automatically paired without heavy computational search for the pairing.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the absence}} of active stabilization, the {{repetition}} rate and carrier–envelope <b>offset</b> <b>frequency</b> {{would be free to}} drift. They vary with changes in the cavity length, refractive index of laser optics, and nonlinear effects such as the Kerr effect. [...] The repetition rate can be stabilized using a piezoelectric transducer, which moves a mirror to change the cavity length.|$|E
2500|$|In the [...] "f − 2f" [...] technique, {{light at}} the lower-energy side of the broadened {{spectrum}} is doubled using second-harmonic generation (SHG) in a nonlinear crystal, and a heterodyne beat is generated between that and {{light at the}} same wavelength on the upper-energy side of the spectrum. [...] This beat signal, detectable with a photodiode, includes a difference-frequency component, which is the carrier–envelope <b>offset</b> <b>frequency.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In high {{repetition}} rate Ti:sapphire ring lasers, which often use double-chirped mirrors to control dispersion, modulation of the pump power using an acousto-optic modulator {{is often used}} to control the <b>offset</b> <b>frequency.</b> [...] The phase slip depends strongly on the Kerr effect, and by changing the pump power one changes the peak intensity of the laser pulse and thus the size of the Kerr phase shift. This shift is far smaller than 6 rad, so an additional device for coarse adjustment is needed. A pair of wedges, one moving in or out of the intra-cavity laser beam can be used for this purpose.|$|E

In this paper, we {{address the problem of}} designing optimal training signals for SISO OFDM channel estimation in the presence of <b>frequency</b> <b>offsets.</b> First, we present optimal training signals for OFDM channel estimation in the absence of <b>frequency</b> <b>offset</b> which include all existing optimal training signals for SISO OFDM channel estimation as a subset. Then we derive the optimal training signals for SISO OFDM channel estimation which are the most robust to <b>frequency</b> <b>offsets.</b> In the absence of <b>frequency</b> <b>offsets,</b> channel estimation mean square error depends only on the ratio of training signal energy to noise variance.

40|$|Abstract- Orthogonal {{frequency-division}} multiplexing (OFDM) has been employed in several {{current and future}} 4 -th generation (4 G) wireless standards. <b>Frequency</b> <b>offsets</b> in OFDM introduce intercarrier interference (ICI). Channel estimations are also required. This thesis focuses on the channel and <b>frequency</b> <b>offset</b> estimation for OFDMbased systems. For cooperative-relay OFDM with <b>frequency</b> <b>offsets,</b> where inter-relay interference (IRI) exists, channel estimation is developed. Optimal pilot designs are proposed by minimizing the IRI in the mean square error (MSE) of the least square (LS) channel estimation. The impact of <b>frequency</b> <b>offset</b> on the channel estimation accuracy is derived. The pairwise error probability (PEP) with both the <b>frequency</b> <b>offset</b> and channel estimation errors is evaluated. The power allocation is discussed. For multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) OFDMsystems, channel and <b>frequency</b> <b>offset</b> estimation errors are investigated. The signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) is first analyzed given channel and <b>frequency</b> <b>offset</b> estimation errors. The bit error rate (BER) is then approximated for multiple-antenna reception with maximal ratio combing (MRC) and equal gain combining (EGC). For orthogonal {{frequency-division multiplexing}} access (OFDMA) systems, the variance of the <b>frequency</b> <b>offset</b> estimation is derived {{as a function of}} SINR and signalto- noise ratio (SNR). This variance information is exploited to improve the accuracy of <b>frequency</b> <b>offset</b> estimators.

50|$|At {{this point}} the IF signal {{consists}} of a video carrier signal at one frequency and the sound carrier at a fixed offset. A demodulator recovers the video signal. Also at {{the output of the}} same demodulator is a new frequency modulated sound carrier at the <b>offset</b> <b>frequency.</b> In some sets made before 1948, this was filtered out, and the sound IF of about 22 MHz was sent to an FM demodulator to recover the basic sound signal. In newer sets, this new carrier at the <b>offset</b> <b>frequency</b> was allowed to remain as intercarrier sound, and it was sent to an FM demodulator to recover the basic sound signal. One particular advantage of intercarrier sound is that when the front panel fine tuning knob is adjusted, the sound carrier frequency does not change with the tuning, but stays at the above-mentioned <b>offset</b> <b>frequency.</b> Consequently, it is easier to tune the picture without losing the sound.|$|E
