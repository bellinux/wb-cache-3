5|$|Regardless of the masing molecule, {{there are}} a few {{requirements}} that must be met for a strong maser source to exist. <b>One</b> <b>requirement</b> is a radio continuum background source to provide the radiation amplified by the maser, as all maser transitions take place at radio wavelengths. The masing molecule must have a pumping mechanism to create the population inversion, and sufficient density and path length for significant amplification to take place. These combine to constrain when and where megamaser emission for a given molecule will take place. The specific conditions for each molecule known to produce megamasers are different, as exemplified by {{the fact that there is}} no known galaxy that hosts both of the two most common megamaser species, hydroxyl and water. As such, the different molecules with known megamasers will be addressed individually.|$|E

2500|$|The {{cellular}} {{level of}} beta-catenin is mostly controlled by its ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation. The E3 ubiquitin ligase TrCP1 (also known as β-TrCP) can recognize β-catenin as its substrate through a short linear motif on the disordered N-terminus. However, this motif (Asp-Ser-Gly-Ile-His-Ser) of β-catenin {{needs to be}} phosphorylated on the two serines {{in order to be}} capable to bind β-TrCP. Phosphorylation of the motif is performed by Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 alpha and beta (GSK3α and GSK3β). GSK3s are constitutively active enzymes implicated in several important regulatory processes. There is <b>one</b> <b>requirement,</b> though: substrates of GSK3 need to be pre-phosphorylated four amino acids downstream (C-terminally) of the actual target site. Thus it also requires a [...] "priming kinase" [...] for its activities. In the case of beta-catenin, the most important priming kinase is Casein Kinase I (CKI). Once a serin-threonine rich substrate has been [...] "primed", GSK3 can [...] "walk" [...] across it from C-terminal to N-terminal direction, phosphorylating every 4th serine or threonine residues in a row. This process will result in dual phosphorylation of the aforementioned β-TrCP recognition motif as well.|$|E
2500|$|Post's {{problem was}} solved with a method called the {{priority}} method; a proof using {{this method is}} called a priority argument. [...] This method is primarily used to construct recursively enumerable sets with particular properties. To use this method, the desired properties of the set to be constructed are broken up into an infinite list of goals, known as requirements, so that satisfying all the requirements will cause the set constructed to have the desired properties. [...] Each requirement is assigned to a natural number representing the priority of the requirement; so 0 is assigned to the most important priority, 1 to the second most important, and so on. [...] The set is then constructed in stages, each stage attempting to satisfy one of more of the requirements by either adding numbers to the set or banning numbers from the set so that the final set will satisfy the requirement. It may happen that satisfying <b>one</b> <b>requirement</b> will cause another to become unsatisfied; the priority order is used {{to decide what to}} do in such an event.|$|E

[...] The length and overall height of the ship were limited {{by the size of}} the Navy's airship shed at Fuhlsbüttel, but Pietzker's proposals enabled the diameter of the airship to be increased without increasing [...] overall height firstly by changing the position of the keel, moving it from outside the main hull structure to within it, and secondly by placing the engine cars closer to the hull. It was powered by four [...] Maybach engines in two engine cars, each car driving a pair of four-bladed propellers which were mounted either side of the envelope via driveshafts and bevel gears.

2500|$|By December 2013, the UCLASS concept {{aircraft}} {{had shifted}} around significantly.

[...] It was planned to weigh , {{about the size of}} the F-14 Tomcat and much larger than the X-47B, and be around [...] in length, longer than the F/A-18 Super Hornet, with endurance potentially up to 14 hours. [...] Other roles were being considered such as an aerial refueling platform to extend the range of fighters, transferring [...] of fuel and still staying airborne for up to 7.5 hours. The four industry teams pushed back against the idea of a more capable UCLASS because the specifications would be significantly different from aircraft they developed for the PDR phase, and cost per aircraft would also increase from $35-$50 million to $100 million. [...] Top-level UCLASS requirements of providing 24-hour persistent ISR coverage from the carrier at “tactically significant” ranges with limited strike capabilities at mid-to-long ranges remained fixed since spring 2013, though detailed specifications had been refined. Cost constraints drove Navy requirements for the UCLASS.

2500|$|The {{idea of the}} {{priority}} method for constructing a r.e. set X is to list a countable sequence of requirements that X must satisfy. For example, to construct a r.e. set X between 0 and 0prime& {{it is enough to}} satisfy the requirements Ae and Be for each natural number e, where Ae requires that the oracle machine with index e does not compute 0prime& from X and Be requires that the Turing machine with index e (and no oracle) does not compute X. [...] These requirements are put into a priority ordering, which is an explicit bijection of the requirements and the natural numbers. The proof proceeds inductively with one stage for each natural number; these stages {{can be thought of as}} steps of time during which the set X is enumerated. [...] At each stage, numbers may be put into X or forever prevented from entering X in an attempt to satisfy requirements (that is, force them to hold once all of X has been enumerated). [...] Sometimes, a number can be enumerated into X to satisfy <b>one</b> <b>requirement</b> but doing this would cause a previously satisfied requirement to become unsatisfied (that is, to be injured). [...] The priority order on requirements is used to determine which requirement to satisfy in this case. [...] The informal idea is that if a requirement is injured then it will eventually stop being injured after all higher priority requirements have stopped being injured, although not every priority argument has this property. [...] An argument must be made that the overall set X is r.e. and satisfies all the requirements. Priority arguments can be used to prove many facts about r.e. sets; the requirements used and the manner in which they are satisfied must be carefully chosen to produce the required result.|$|E
