5|$|We played Birmingham City in {{pre-season}} {{and he got}} {{a lovely}} ovation from their supporters and it was the same at Yeovil last year. He got a lovely clap at Northampton a few weeks ago when he was taken <b>off.</b> <b>I</b> don't think that happened by coincidence. And I've got a feeling that if he leaves Cheltenham he will get a similar reception if he comes back with another club. Supporters recognise him and they see the whole-heartedness and the commitment and the ability that he has got.|$|E
5|$|I {{remained}} on the wreck until she went down; the suction took me down some way, and a man got hold of my leg, but I managed to kick him off and came up and struck out for some pieces of wood {{that were on the}} water and started for land, about two miles <b>off.</b> <b>I</b> was in the water about five hours, as the shore was so rocky and the surf ran so high that a great many were lost trying to land. Nearly all those that took to the water without their clothes on were taken by sharks; hundreds of them were all round us, and I saw men taken by them close to me, but as I was dressed (having on a flannel shirt and trousers) they preferred the others. I was not in the least hurt, and am happy to say, kept my head clear; most of the officers lost their lives from losing their presence of mind and trying to take money with them, and from not throwing off their coats. - Letter from Lieutenant J.F. Girardot, 43rd Light Infantry, to his father, 1 March 1852.|$|E

6000|$|... "Bills {{are like}} dram-drinking," [...] said the {{discreet}} young lord: [...] "when one once begins, {{it is very}} hard to leave <b>off.</b> <b>Is</b> it true that the men are here now, Mark?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Are you in {{communication}} with General Banks? Is he coming toward you or going farther <b>off?</b> <b>Is</b> there or has there been anything to hinder his coming directly to you by water from Alexandria? ...|$|R
25|$|Through {{a door in}} the bed we see Pixie and {{the girls}} arrive through a locker into a locker room where they start to prepare {{themselves}} for the clap <b>off.</b> <b>I</b> shot at MC Motors and as this location is used a lot, I didn't want it to look like other videos but liked the textures and structure. We built a lockerroom with a pink perplex floor, leopard printdrops and a circular red pouffe.|$|E
25|$|In verses {{five and}} six, Mazaraki gives his verdict on the property. He notes {{the absence of}} bird song, which he regards as a very bad sign. In verse six the doctor declares: “If no birds are heard/death reigns here./My advice is that we depart this place quickly/so <b>off</b> <b>I</b> go”. The doctor mounts up {{and returns to the}} city in verse seven, {{accompanied}} by Stampfer, Gutmann, and Barnett. Only Salomon “with his prophetic eyes” remains behind to spend the night on that hill, we are told in verse eight.|$|E
500|$|... "I'd {{been told}} that my whole life, but at this {{critical}} juncture, with my career taking <b>off,</b> <b>I</b> didn't have the wherewithal to argue. [...] We [...] shared a house and spent weeks exercising [...] [...] I was as motivated as ever {{to come out on}} top. [...] I felt good when it was over. I enjoed the compliments about my [...] "new" [...] shape. I shot the video and did in fact reshape my image." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wisdom {{falls from}} the lips of my brother," [...] he said. [...] "I was well <b>off</b> {{yesterday}} and <b>I</b> am badly <b>off</b> to-day, but <b>I</b> may be well <b>off</b> again to-morrow--if <b>I</b> have good luck." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Girls, do {{you know}} that Carrie has gone abroad? There has been so much talk, her father could n't bear it, and took the whole family <b>off.</b> <b>Is</b> n't that gay?" [...] said one lively damsel, who had just come in.|$|R
500|$|National Review writer Mark Hemingway lauded the film's {{celebration of}} liberty. [...] "If there's a better {{celluloid}} expression of ordinary American freedom than Ferris Bueller's Day <b>Off,</b> <b>I</b> {{have yet to}} see it. If you could take one day and do absolutely anything, piling into a convertible with your best girl and your best friend and taking in a baseball game, an art museum, and a fine meal seems about as good as it gets," [...] wrote Hemingway.|$|E
500|$|An't (sometimes a'n't) {{arose from}} am not {{and are not}} almost simultaneously. An't first appears in print {{in the work of}} English Restoration playwrights. In 1695 an't was used as a {{contraction}} of [...] "am not", in William Congreve's play Love for Love: [...] "I can hear you farther <b>off,</b> <b>I</b> an't deaf". But as early as 1696 Sir John Vanbrugh uses an't to mean [...] "are not" [...] in The Relapse: [...] "Hark thee shoemaker! These shoes an't ugly, but they don't fit me".|$|E
500|$|Capitalizing on the success, the Revolutionary forces quickly {{replaced}} the bridge planking and gave chase. [...] One enterprising company led {{by one of}} Caswell's lieutenants forded the creek above the bridge, flanking the retreating Loyalists. [...] Colonel Moore {{arrived on the scene}} a few hours after the battle. [...] He stated in his report that 30 Loyalists were killed or wounded, [...] "but as numbers of them must have fallen into the creek, besides more that were carried <b>off,</b> <b>I</b> suppose their loss may be estimated at fifty." [...] The Revolutionary leaders reported one killed and one wounded.|$|E
6000|$|... "Jump in, Brooke," [...] {{cried the}} Captain, {{as he sat}} in the stern-sheets looking up at our hero, who was busily engaged {{assisting}} the first mate to complete the arrangements of his boat, [...] "we've struck twice already. <b>I</b> must shove <b>off.</b> <b>Is</b> Raywood ready?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would give}} half of {{whatever}} {{there is in}} the mine to have you come. But things being as they are, well, I guess we can call it <b>off.</b> <b>Is</b> there any chance in the world, Kirk, of your ever ceasing to be a bloated capitalist? Could any of your stocks go back on you?" ...|$|R

500|$|On October 11, 2013, {{the band}} {{reportedly}} {{began working on}} their eighth studio album, Kintsugi, produced by Rich Costey. This was then confirmed by the group's official Instagram profile in which an image was uploaded with the caption [...] "DCFC LP8 begins". In an interview with Stereogum, Gibbard said of the new album, [...] "I do think {{from start to finish}} it's a much better record than Codes And Keys. If that record turned anybody <b>off,</b> <b>I</b> feel pretty strongly that this one could win them back. There are threads in this one that connect back to our earliest stuff that people love." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of the {{announcement}} of Windsor's departure, it was reported she wanted to take a two-year break, but after that would like to make return appearances as Peggy. However, in September 2010, she ruled out a return, saying, [...] "It was a bit selfish of me but I didn't want to be killed <b>off.</b> <b>I</b> am never going to go back but I like to think that 's still out there somewhere." [...] At the recording of the new series of The Rob Brydon Show for BBC Two, Brydon asked if she would consider returning, to which Windsor replied, [...] "Never say never".|$|E
500|$|Boycott was {{involved}} in a number of disputes while on Achill. Two years after his arrival, he was unsuccessfully sued for assault by Thomas Clarke, a local man. Clarke said that he had gone to Boycott's house because Boycott owed him money. He said that he had asked for repayment of the debt, and that Boycott had refused to pay him and told him to go away, which Clarke refused to do. Clarke alleged that Boycott approached him and said: [...] "If you do not be <b>off,</b> <b>I</b> will make you." [...] Clarke later withdrew his allegations, and said that Boycott did not actually owe him any money.|$|E

"No doubt, ye had need to {{be always}} on the look out where there are such varmints; but hereaway, Arrowhead, there are no foes to fear, and {{therefore}} no need to take yer friends by surprise. But ye're proud o' your gifts, lad, an' I suppose it's natural to like to show them <b>off.</b> <b>Is</b> the canoe ready?" ...|$|R

500|$|... "After a while I {{got sick}} of wearing tons of jewelry—I wanted to clean myself <b>off.</b> <b>I</b> see my new look as very {{innocent}} and feminine and unadorned. It {{makes me feel}} good. Growing up, I admired the kind of beautiful glamorous woman—from Brigitte Bardot to Grace Kelly—who doesn't seem to be around much anymore. I think it's time {{for that kind of}} glamor to come back. In pop music generally, people have one image. You get pigeonholed. I'm lucky {{enough to be able to}} change and still be accepted. If you think about it, that's what they do in the movies; play a part, change characters, looks and attitudes. I guess I do it to entertain myself." ...|$|E
500|$|On August 14, 2010, [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] debuted {{at number}} 142 on the UK Singles chart, and it moved from number seventy-one to number 40 on the R chart. After the digital release of remixes, the song rose to number 71 on the UK Singles chart, {{becoming}} the ninth consecutive single <b>off</b> <b>I</b> Am... Sasha Fierce to peak within the top 75. It also moved from number 44 to number 25 on its R chart on September 11, 2010. The following week, on September 18, 2010, [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] moved up twenty {{places on the}} UK Singles to land at number 51 and ascended to number 14 on its R chart.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after Mangini joined Dream Theater, Portnoy e-mailed {{the band}} asking to rejoin, but his attempt was rebuffed. Reflecting on his arrival to the band, Mangini told Noisecreep, [...] "As I see it, as I look back, I really think what {{happened}} was that this band kind of started over. They were in a new place as they looked for a drummer, and I when got the news, after the shock wore <b>off,</b> <b>I</b> knew what I wanted to do – which was just basically come in and try to support where they wanted to go. They had a vision, they had great ideas, and I just wanted to help them achieve those things." ...|$|E

500|$|A November 2005 demo {{contained}} thirteen songs, {{which included}} rough versions of [...] "Aesthetics of Hate" [...] and [...] "Halo". [...] "Aesthetics of Hate" [...] contained what Flynn {{described as a}} [...] "totally fucking lame [...] "Angel of Death" [...] rip <b>off.</b> <b>I</b> hated it every time we played it so I {{was glad to see}} that part go!" [...] In mid August 2006, Machine Head announced that the title of their sixth studio effort would be The Blackening. Flynn and drummer Dave McClain spent August 18 and 19 jamming together, fine tuning songs chosen for the album and performing pre-production. Phil Demmel resumed lead guitar duties and Adam Duce returned as bassist.|$|E
500|$|Brown {{was offered}} the part of Dot Cotton {{for a period of}} three months {{initially}} and in her own words, she was brought in [...] "merely to be Nick Cotton's mother because Nick was coming back again". Brown has told Decca Aitkenhead of The Guardian in 2009 that she was wary of joining a soap opera as she had seen EastEnders once on television, [...] "and there was an argument going on, and I thought, 'Oh, I don't want to watch all that,' so I switched it <b>off.</b> <b>I</b> didn't watch it again until I was asked to be in it." [...] The role was extended and the character {{has become one of the}} longest-running to have featured in EastEnders.|$|E
500|$|The court heard that, in 1988 while Jacobs {{was serving}} his {{sentence}} for affray, a guard found rap lyrics in his cell, in Jacobs' handwriting, that described Blakelock's killing: [...] "we start chop {{him on his}} hand we chop him on him finger we chop him on him leg we chop him on his shoulder him head him chest him neck.." [...] The defence responded that Bob Marley had not been prosecuted for [...] "I Shot the Sheriff." [...] The court was also told that, when Jacobs was arrested for a separate offence in May 2000, by then aged 30, he reportedly told an officer: [...] "F*** <b>off,</b> <b>I</b> {{was one of them}} who killed PC Blakelock," [...] which the defence called a [...] "flippant street remark." ...|$|E
