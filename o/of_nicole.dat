5|$|Cecil {{decided the}} game would start {{a day before}} the Parisian cafe {{explosion}} in the original game, filling in some <b>of</b> <b>Nicole</b> Collard's back-story. To this end, Cecil also drafted in the acclaimed comic book artist Dave Gibbons, with whom Revolution worked previously on their 1994 cult classic adventure Beneath a Steel Sky. In addition to working on the visual references for the game, Gibbons also produced a comic book to accompany the game's DS release. Gibbons stated {{that he decided to}} return to video game work on this game because he knew producing character shots with a range of expressions would be challenging, and he knew he would enjoy it, based upon past experience.|$|E
5|$|In the past, Adrian Monk (Tony Shalhoub) was a San Francisco Police Department's investigator, but {{the death}} of his wife, Trudy, led him to develop depression, obsessive–compulsive {{disorder}} and multiple phobias. Now, as a private detective, Monk investigates the murder <b>of</b> <b>Nicole</b> Vasquez (Michelle Addison). Later, a shooting occurs during a campaign rally, resulting in the bodyguard of mayoral candidate Warren St. Claire (Michael Hogan) getting killed. The incumbent mayor orders Captain Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine) to bring Monk in on the case, and, as Monk's former supervisor, reluctantly, he does.|$|E
5|$|The {{remnants}} <b>of</b> <b>Nicole,</b> {{combined with}} the extratropical storm, produced strong winds in New England, with gusts of up to 65mph (105km/h). In Maine, the winds snapped branches off trees, and also downed trees and power lines. Power outages were reported, primarily in coastal portions of Washington and Hancock Counties. Nicole produced moderate swells along the East Coast of the United States. Conditions for surfing were best in New York and Rhode Island, where swells of over 4feet (1.2m) occurred.|$|E

5|$|On October5, a {{national}} disaster was declared for Jamaica {{due to the}} effects <b>of</b> <b>Nicole.</b> In response, the USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance provided US$50,000 for the purchase and delivery of relief supplies and fuel for emergency vehicles. About J$4million (US$46,800) was donated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries to the Greenhouse Growers Association for the repair of greenhouses. In conjunction with the Food and Agriculture Organization, an estimated J$12million (US$140,400) was made available to initiate the planting of about 50,000 crop seedlings. The Veterinary Division provided financial assistance to livestock farmers and dispatched animal technicians with prophylactic medication and vitamins to avert foot rot disease in small ruminants, including goats and sheep. The cost of the medications was estimated at J$2million (US$23,400). The Banana Board's Catastrophe Fund, {{which at the time}} comprised J$50million (US$585,000), delivered both monetary support and human resources to local banana and plantain farmers.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian Hurricane Centre issued seven bulletins on the storm, {{though the}} system only briefly entered the centre's {{response}} zone before it dissipated. Due to moisture from Nicole {{combined with the}} extratropical storm, the Atlantic Storm Prediction Centre issued heavy rainfall and wind warnings for large portions of the Canadian Maritimes. The remnants <b>of</b> <b>Nicole,</b> combined with a powerful extratropical storm, produced strong winds across the Maritimes, including over 80mph (130km/h) on western Cape Breton. The strong winds uprooted trees and downed power lines, while the winds combined with rough seas cancelled ferry crossings and restricted access to the Confederation Bridge. The storm complex also dropped over 2inches (60mm) of rainfall, causing flooding in eastern Nova Scotia. The storm's passage {{during the middle of}} apple harvest caused troubles for Annapolis Valley.|$|E
5|$|The complex {{interaction}} between a cold front, multiple tropical waves, {{and a broad}} {{area of low pressure}} in the wake <b>of</b> <b>Nicole</b> {{led to the formation of}} a tropical depression by 00:00UTC on October11 about 115mi (185km) southeast of Cabo Gracias a Dios. The nascent cyclone intensified into Tropical Storm Paula six hours later, briefly moving ashore the northeastern tip of Honduras early on October11 before re-emerging into the northwestern Caribbean. Amid a favorable environment, Paula intensified into a hurricane by 00:00UTC on October12 and attained peak winds of 105mph (165km/h) at 18:00UTC while maintaining an unusually small size. An increase in shear prompted a steady weakening trend as the system turned north and then east. Paula fell to tropical storm intensity early on October14, making landfall between Santa Lucia and Puerto Esperanza with winds of 65mph (100km/h). The system further weakened to a tropical depression early on October15 and degenerated into a remnant low by 12:00UTC. The remnant low quickly became diffuse, dissipating at 18:00UTC.|$|E

5|$|Nicole {{produced}} {{a tremendous amount}} of rain in Jamaica, totaling to 37.42in (950.5mm) in Belleisle. Severe flooding and landslides affected up to 507,831 residents, resulting 16 deaths and 42 injuries. Flooded roadways isolated communities, trapping hundreds of people in their homes. Over 288,000 residences lost power, over 40 percent of the island's water supply systems were inoperable at one point, and dozens of bridges collapsed. Infrastructure damage totaled to $235.4 million, while property damage reached $3.2 million and agricultural damage amounted to $6.8 million. In nearby Cuba, rainfall reached 9.22in (234mm) and winds gusted to 53mph (85km/h); houses were flooded, crops were damaged, and livestock was killed as a result. Similar impacts occurred across the Cayman Islands, with sporadic power outages, flooding in low-lying locations, and damaged houses. While the remnants <b>of</b> <b>Nicole</b> produced only minor impacts across Florida, mainly in the form of street flooding, impacts were much more severe across the Mid-Atlantic as the system combined with a large area of low pressure across the region. Record-breaking rainfall, accumulating to 22.54in (572.5mm) in Wilmington, North Carolina, closed over 150 roadways, knocked out power, and caused traffic accidents.|$|E
5|$|On March 21, 2009, Ubisoft {{released}} {{a special edition}} of The Shadow of the Templars for the Wii and Nintendo DS. According to Cecil, the Director's Cut came about thanks to a group of Broken Sword fans, who started an online petition begging him to bring the series to the Wii and DS. The game starts a day before the Parisian cafe explosion in the original game, filling in some <b>of</b> <b>Nicole</b> Collard's back-story. Dave Gibbons, with whom Revolution worked previously on their 1994 cult classic adventure Beneath a Steel Sky, worked on visual references for the game; He also produced a comic book to accompany the game's DS release. In the Director's Cut, Hazel Ellerby returns to voice Nicole Collard in the new sections, playing Nico again {{for the first time since}} the original game's release. Rolf Saxon, as in every sequel, also returns to voice George Stobbart. Unlike in the original game, players control Nicole Collard for selected game sections. Besides the new character artwork by Gibbons during conversations, the Director's Cut also features a new first person view for certain puzzles.

In May 2010, a version with higher resolution and a digital comic was released on the iPad. A PC version was released on August 27, 2010 on various digital distribution services.|$|E
