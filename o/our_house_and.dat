25|$|Marlena was {{introduced}} {{as a guest}} character in June 1976, by executive producer Betty Corday. The show decided to cast actress Deidre Hall, who was already known in the soap world {{for her role as}} Barbara on The Young and the Restless. The character was brought in as the psychiatrist of already established character – Mickey Horton. This puts her in close contact with the soap's core family, The Hortons. This also allows her to meet her first new lover in Salem, Don Craig (Mickey's assistant). Specifically, she {{played a key role in}} a storyline involving her twin sister, Samantha Evans (who was played by Hall's real life twin, Andrea Hall) at the same sanitarium Mickey was committed to. The character proved to be popular, and they decided to put her on contract. Marlena eventually started a relationship with Roman Brady, who established her to a core family on the show, the Brady family. In the 1980s, Hall had decided to explore primetime. She landed the lead role on the family oriented series, <b>Our</b> <b>House,</b> <b>and</b> guest starred on other prime time hits such as Wiseguy and Columbo. She left Days of Our Lives after her primetime and daytime schedule became too hard to balance. In 1991 (after the primetime series ended), Hall began to miss daytime's creative outlet, and returned to the show that same year. Her return prompted a 10% increase in the Nielsen ratings for the soap.|$|E

60|$|So I {{feel that}} if We Men, who are left alone in <b>our</b> <b>houses</b> <b>and</b> apartments in the summer-time, would only set {{ourselves}} to it, we could make life not only a little brighter for ourselves but also a little less bright for those about us.|$|R

2500|$|On top of {{his grief}} for his family and friends, Zubeidi was greatly embittered {{by the fact that}} none of the Israelis who had {{accepted}} his mother's hospitality, and whom he had thought were his friends, tried to contact him. In a 2006 interview he stated angrily, [...] "You took <b>our</b> <b>house</b> <b>and</b> our mother and you killed our brother. We gave you everything and what did we get in return? A bullet in my mother’s chest. We opened our home and you demolished it. Every week, 20-30 Israelis would come to do theatre there. We fed them. And afterward, not one of them picked up the phone. That is when we saw the real face of the left in Israel." [...] The Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades may reach peace with Israel, he says, but he won’t personally. He won’t forgive the killing of his mother and brother and the razing of his house.|$|E

6000|$|... "Nonsense, man," [...] I replied. [...] "When our burglars {{walk into}} <b>our</b> <b>houses</b> <b>and</b> politely demand, {{thousands}} of dollars' worth of jewels, and then dine and bang the piano {{an hour or}} two before leaving, how do you, a mere murderer, expect to come in contact with the detective that is looking for you?" ...|$|R

However, from 1723 to 1823 the office was a sinecure held by members of the Abercrombie family, not necessarily connected with artistic ability.|$|R

60|$|We had {{no police}} force, {{not even a}} village organization. There was a small railway station near <b>our</b> <b>house,</b> <b>and</b> six miles away was the county town. For fire and police {{protection}} each household was obliged to depend upon itself.|$|E
