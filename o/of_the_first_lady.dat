5|$|The First Lady of the United States is {{the hostess}} of the White House. The {{position}} is traditionally filled by {{the wife of}} the President of the United States, but, on occasion, the title has been applied to women who were not presidents’ wives, such as when the president was a bachelor or widower, or when {{the wife of the}} president was unable to fulfill the duties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Lady</b> herself. The First Lady is not an elected position; it carries no official duties and receives no salary. Nonetheless, she attends many official ceremonies and functions of state either along with or in place of the president. Traditionally, the First Lady does not hold outside employment while occupying the office. She has her own staff, including the White House Social Secretary, the Chief of Staff, the Press Secretary, the Chief Floral Designer, and the Executive Chef. The Office <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Lady</b> is also in charge of all social and ceremonial events of the White House, and is a branch of the Executive Office of the President.|$|E
5|$|Compromised as a {{reporter}} by her personal relationship with Roosevelt, Hickok left the AP and began work as the chief investigator for the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA), a department of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal. Hickok encouraged or inspired several of Eleanor Roosevelt's initiatives, including her syndicated column, her all-women press conferences, and her planned community at Arthurdale, West Virginia. As Hickok grew more demanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Lady,</b> however, the pair's initial closeness lessened. Following complications with her diabetes, Hickok resigned from FERA in 1936 and worked for three years promoting the 1939 New York World's Fair. From 1940 to 1945, she served as the executive secretary of the Women's Division of the Democratic National Committee, living at the White House {{for most of this}} time. As her diabetes steadily worsened, she lived out her final years at Hyde Park to be near Roosevelt, publishing several books.|$|E

25|$|The colony was {{established}} on November 7, 1924, and was initially named Colonia Regina de Alvear, in honor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>lady,</b> Regina Pacini de Alvear. Héctor Valsecchi {{was named the}} first president of the company. Bonoli and his helper, Emilio Bignami, planned the organization and development of the area. The company spent most of its starting capital of US$1.4 million buying the 5,000 hectares. During the first year, they worked 1,300 hectares, which were divided into lots of 5, 10 and 15 hectares. To settle this area, the company gave preference to the Italian immigrants that already lived in Argentina. During the second stage, the company cultivated 1,200 hectares; these were given to Italian families that wanted to immigrate to Argentina. Those in this second wave of settlement were selected by the officials of the company. By 1927, 1,000 people had settled in the town. Soon a hospital, a church, a school, a library and a sports club were built. The Bank of Rome gave the settlement a loan of 5 million lire, in spite of Benito Mussolini's plan to use that money to support Italian workers in Italy. Further loans to the settlement were leveraged by Bonoli's connection to Ottavio Dinale. Dinale, a collaborator of Mussolini, had influence with the General Commissariat of Emigration (Italian: Commissariato Generale dell'Emigrazione). The loans were given by the Banca Commerciale Italiana, through the Francés y Italiano para América del Sur bank and the Italia y Río de la Plata bank.|$|E

500|$|Erskine {{himself was}} a [...] "singular {{compound}} of good and bad qualities". In addition to his legal career {{he was elected to}} Parliament in 1734 and he survived the vicissitudes of the Jacobite rebellions unscathed. He was a philanderer and over-partial to claret, whilst at the same time deeply religious. This last quality would have been instrumental in any decision not to have his wife assassinated, and he did not marry his long-term partner Fanny Lindsay until after he had heard <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>Lady</b> Grange's death.|$|E
500|$|She was {{involved}} by being [...] "the {{eyes and the}} ears" [...] of the New Deal. She looked to the future and was committed to social reform. One of those programs helped working women receive better wages. The New Deal also placed women into less machine work and more white collar work. Women {{did not have to}} work in the factories making war supplies because men were coming home so they could take over the long days and nights women had been working to contribute to the war efforts. Roosevelt brought unprecedented activism and ability to the role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Lady.</b>|$|E

500|$|That same day, Hickok interviewed Roosevelt in a White House bathroom, {{her first}} {{official}} interview as First Lady. By this time, Hickok was deeply {{in love with}} Roosevelt and finding {{it increasingly difficult to}} provide objective reporting. In addition, Hickok's job kept her largely in New York, while Eleanor was in Washington. Both women were troubled by the separation, professing their love by telephone and letter; Roosevelt put a picture of Hickok up in her study, which she told Hickok she kissed every night and every morning. During this period, Roosevelt wrote daily ten- to fifteen-page letters to [...] "Hick", who was planning to write a biography <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Lady.</b>|$|E
500|$|Roosevelt {{also had}} a close {{relationship}} with Associated Press (AP) reporter Lorena Hickok, who covered her during the last months of the presidential campaign and [...] "fell madly in love with her". During this period, Roosevelt wrote daily 10- to 15-page letters to [...] "Hick", who was planning to write a biography <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Lady.</b> The letters included such endearments as, [...] "I want to put my arms around you & kiss you at the corner of your mouth," [...] and, [...] "I can't kiss you, so I kiss your 'picture' good night and good morning!" [...] At Franklin's 1933 inauguration, Eleanor wore a sapphire ring Hickok had given her. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover despised Roosevelt's liberalism, her stance regarding civil rights, and her and her husband FDR's criticisms of Hoover's surveillance tactics, and so Hoover maintained a large file on Roosevelt, which the filmmakers of the biopic J. Edgar (2011) indicate included compromising evidence of this relationship, which Hoover intended to blackmail Roosevelt with. Compromised as a reporter, Hickok soon resigned her position with the AP to be closer to Eleanor, who secured her a job as an investigator for a New Deal program.|$|E
500|$|Roosevelt was an unprecedentedly outspoken First Lady {{who made}} far more {{use of the}} media than her predecessors; she held 348 press {{conferences}} over the span of her husband's 12-year presidency. Inspired by her relationship with Hickok, Roosevelt placed a ban on male reporters attending the press conferences, effectively forcing newspapers to keep female reporters on staff in order to cover them. She relaxed the rule only once, on her return from her 1943 Pacific trip. Because the Gridiron Club banned women from its annual Gridiron Dinner for journalists, Roosevelt hosted a competing event for female reporters at the White House, which she called [...] "Gridiron Widows". [...] She was interviewed by many newspapers; the New Orleans journalist Iris Kelso described Mrs. Roosevelt as her most interesting interviewee ever. [...] In {{the early days of}} her all-female press conferences, she said they would not address [...] "politics, legislation, or executive decision,", since the role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Lady</b> was expected to be non-political at that time. She also agreed at first that she would avoid discussing her views on pending congressional measures. Still, the press conferences provided a welcome opportunity for the women reporters to speak directly with Mrs. Roosevelt, access that had been unavailable in previous administrations.|$|E

500|$|Separately {{from the}} Independent Counsel investigation, Judicial Watch, a {{conservative}} watchdog group, engaged in long-running litigation over the White House personnel file controversy. [...] Judicial Watch's Cara Leslie Alexander et al. vs. Federal Bureau of Investigation et al. class action lawsuit, filed {{on behalf of}} {{several members of the}} Reagan and George H. W. Bush Administrations, alleged that Livingstone, along with Anthony Marceca and William Kennedy, obtained the files and then rifled through them. [...] Judicial Watch founder and Clintons antagonist suprême Larry Klayman attracted enough attention with the case to have the recurring Larry Claypool character modeled after him on the television series The West Wing. [...] As late as January 2000, Judicial Watch was filing affidavits in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia under Judge Royce C. Lamberth related to the case. [...] In their $90 million lawsuit, they claimed that the First Lady did, despite her denials, know Livingstone – indeed, that Livingstone had bragged to associates he was very close to both the president and his wife – and that Clinton had personally hired him for the security job. (White House defenders pointed out that Livingstone had a long history of exaggerating his importance and connections.) Judicial Watch also said they had five sources who claimed Livingstone had been hired by and worked under the First Lady, and also discovered some photographs of Livingstone in the vicinity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Lady</b> (but not talking with him). [...] In December 2002 Judicial Watch obtained a ruling from Judge Lamberth that recently uncovered White House e-mails be searched for possible evidence in the lawsuit. [...] Klayman said, [...] "Hillary Clinton was the mastermind of Filegate. She will not escape justice." [...] Klayman and Judicial Watch had a severe falling out in 2003, however, and several years went by with little or nothing happening in the lawsuit.|$|E
