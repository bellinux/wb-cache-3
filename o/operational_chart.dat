The work of Anthonisen et al. (1976), who produced an <b>operational</b> <b>chart</b> providing guidance {{on the free}} ammonia concentrations most likely to produce nitrite oxidizer inhibition, {{is considered by many}} to be the definitive work that established the inhibitory nature of free ammonia in wastewater treatment systems. Over the past three decades several investigators have reported discrepancies in the range of inhibitory free ammonia concentrations. Anthonisen et al. (1976) reported inhibition of nitrite-oxidizers at free ammonia concentrations of 0. 1 to 1 mg/L, Turk and Mavinic (1986) reported no significant nitrite-oxidizer inhibition for free ammonia concentrations below 10 mg NH 3 -N/L, whereas Mauret et al. (1996) concluded that free ammonia inhibits Nitrobacter, in the range of 6. 6 to 8. 9 mg NH 3 -N/L. On the other hand, Gieseke et al.

To imitate human visual inspection of raw images, we have designed and implemented a data mining application that first categorizes pixels into regions, and then extracts for each region a complex feature set of more than 30 attributes.

A proxy based on stage of development data from the National Ice Center (NIC) weekly <b>operational</b> <b>charts</b> is {{used to create a}} high-resolution time series of sea ice concentration, thickness and volume for 2000 - 2009. Record-length mean thickness and volume of Antarctic sea ice are 66. 7 cm and 7. 7 x 10 ^ 3 km^ 3. The mean growth and decay seasons in the Southern Ocean and in the Ross sector are 210 days and 155 days, but at least at least one week shorter (growth) and longer (decay) in the Amundsen/Bellingshausen sector. Over 90 % of the Antarctic continental shelf is covered with sea ice for 3 - 5 months, and for 2 to 4 months longer periods in the Amundsen/Bellingshausen and Ross sectors. Yearly mean sea ice area (extent) in the Southern Ocean increased at a rate of 0. 71 x 10 ^ 6 km^ 2 /decade (0. 70 x 10 ^ 6 km^ 2 /decade), equivalent to a 7. 7 %/decade (6. 3 %/decade) rise. A comparable trend of 9. 1 %/decade (8. 5 %/decade) is estimated in the Ross sector, at 0. 21 x 10 ^ 6 km 2 /decade (0. 23 x 10 ^ 6 km 2 /decade). The opposite trend is found in the Amundsen/Bellingshausen sector: a - 0. 15 x 10 ^ 6 km^ 2 /decade (- 0. 17 x 10 ^ 6 km^ 2 /decade) decline, or - 14. 6 %/decade (- 13. 4 %/decade). The estimated annual increase of Antarctic sea ice thickness is 22. 6 cm/decade (49. 2 %/decade) and of volume is 3. 78 x 10 ^ 3 km^ 3 /decade (68. 3 %/decade). The Ross sector showed similar trends for thickness, at 23. 8 cm/decade (47. 0 %/decade), and volume, at 1. 11 x 10 ^ 3 km^ 3 /decade (75. 8 %/decade). Thickness has increased in the Amundsen/Bellingshausen sector, 20. 7 cm/decade (44. 8 %/decade), but with a less pronounced volume rise of 0. 17 x 10 ^ 3 km^ 3 /decade (26. 0 %/decade). Monthly sea ice thickness anomalies show a weak response to the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index. A strong positive response is observed in 2008 when a negative a negative ENSO index compounded to a positive Southern Annular Mode (SAM) index.

Numerical analyses from the U. K. Meteorological Office, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, and the U. S. National Centers for Environmental Prediction are compared with high quality analyses prepared using all available late data and high-resolution satellite imagery. The subjective assessment of the analyses indicated that no large, synoptic-scale systems were missing, but major discrepancies were found {{in terms of the}} depth of the lows, location errors, and failures to resolve the complexities of systems. Generally, the central pressures of the lows were handled better than the locations of the centers. Only 4 lows {{out of a total of}} 161 in the Eastern Hemisphere during the period 22 – 28 July had to be relocated more than 500 km. High-quality satellite imagery was very important in correcting the locations of the lows and in resolving the structure of multicentered systems, which were often found to be much more complex than analyzed on the <b>operational</b> <b>charts.</b> The satellite imagery was of less value over the continent since some of the lows here, which were analyzed using automatic weather station data, had no cloud associated with them as a result of the atmosphere being very dry. Few changes were made to the positions of anticyclones and only minor modifications to ridges were required. The mean pressure at mean sea level fields for July 1994 as produced by the four models were all very similar, but the Australian model stood out as slightly different over the Amundsen Sea because of large differences in the handling on one large low during the early part of the month. The Phillpot technique for the analysis of the 500 -hPa surface over the interior of the continent was of particular value in resolving structure in the circulation. ...|$|R

40|$|Geiger, CathleenAlthough sea ice concentration, extent, {{and type}} can be {{measured}} with acceptable accuracy by satellite or airborne remote sensing techniques, sea ice thickness measurements are difficult to obtain accurately, even in situ. Modeling sea ice volume and associated transport requires input data for ice motion, {{as well as for}} the distribution of sea ice thickness. There is a need to develop new sea ice models driven by the best available data. The majority of sea ice thickness measurements in the Southern Ocean are derived from drill holes, and more recently upward looking sonar and electromagnetic methods, but these data points are sparse. The most comprehensive sea ice thickness dataset for Antarctic sea ice available to date is the Antarctic Sea Ice Processes and Climate (ASPeCt) program, which includes 23, 373 ship-based observations collected over two decades; however, this dataset has spatial and temporal gaps.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{evaluation}} of operational conditions such as temperature, exposure time and flux on the polarization of a Schottky electron collection CdTe detector. A Schottky e- collection CdTe Medipix 3 RX hybrid pixel detector was developed {{as a part of}} the CALIPSO-HIZPAD 2 EU project. The 128 × 128 pixel matrix and 0. 75 mm thick CdTe sensor bump-bonded to Medipix 3 RX readout chips enabled the study of the polarization effects. Single and quad module Medipix 3 RX chips were used which had 128 × 128 and 256 × 256 pixel matrices, respectively. This study reports the sensor-level and pixel-level polarization effects of the detector obtained from a laboratory X-ray source. We report that the sensor-level polarization is highly dependent on temperature, flux and exposure time. Furthermore, the study of pixel-level polarization effects led to identification of a new type of pixel behaviour that is characterised by three distinct phases and, thus, named “tri-phase” (3 -P) pixels. The 3 -P pixels were the dominant cause of degradation of the flat-field image uniformity under high flux operation. A new method of identifying the optimum operational conditions that utilises a criterion related to the 3 -P pixels is proposed. A generated optimum <b>operational</b> conditions <b>chart</b> under the new method is reported. The criterion is used for bias voltage reset depolarization of the detector. The method successfully represented the dependency of polarization on temperature, flux and exposure time and was reproducible for multiple sensors. Operating the detector under the 3 -P pixel criterion resulted in the total efficiency not falling below 95 %...|$|R
40|$|Observations of sea {{ice from}} space are {{routinely}} {{used to monitor}} sea ice extent, concentration and type to support human marine activity and climate change studies. In this study, eight dual-polarization (dual-pol) (HH/HV) RADARSAT- 2 ScanSAR images acquired over the Gulf of St. Lawrence {{during the winter of}} 2009 are analysed to determine what new or improved sea ice information is provided by dual-pol C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data at wide swath widths, relative to single co-pol data. The objective {{of this study is to}} assess how dual-pol RADARSAT- 2 ScanSAR data might improve <b>operational</b> ice <b>charts</b> and derived sea ice climate data records. In order to evaluate the dual-pol data, ice thickness and surface roughness measurements and optical remote sensing data were compared to backscatter signatures observed in the SAR data. The study found that: i) dual-pol data provide improved separation of ice and open water, particularly at steep incidence angles and high wind speeds; ii) the contrast between new, young and first-year (FY) ice types is reduced in the cross-pol channel; and iii) large areas of heavily deformed ice can reliably be separated from level ice in the dual-pol data, but areas of light and moderately ridged ice cannot be resolved and the thickness of heavily deformed ice cannot be determined. These results are limited to observations of new, young and FY ice types in winter conditions. From an operational perspective, the improved separation of ice and open water will increase the accuracy of ice edge and total ice concentration estimates while reducing the time required to produce image analysis charts. Further work is needed to determine if areas of heavily ridged ice can be separated from areas of heavily rafted ice based on knowledge of ice conditions in the days preceding the formation of high backscatter deformed ice. If rafted and ridged ice can be separated, tactical ridged ice information should be included on image analysis charts. The dual-pol data can also provide small improvements to ice extent and concentration data in derived climate data records. Further analysis of dual-pol RADARSAT- 2 ScanSAR data over additional ice regimes and seasons is required...|$|R
40|$|<b>Operational</b> sea ice <b>charts</b> are {{currently}} produced manually, an inefficient process resulting in subjective ice charts. Hence, {{there is a}} need for automating this procedure. This thesis investigates how polarimetric microwave radar signatures relate to the physical properties of sea ice, and how these signatures may contribute to the development of robust automatic algorithms. Our analyses are based on polarimetric space-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) scenes co- with in-situ data obtained north of Svalbard in April 2011. The thesis consists of three papers. The first paper investigated the performance of a feature based automatic segmentation algorithm and compared it to two manual drawn ice charts. The analysis revealed big discrepancies between the ice charts and demonstrated benefits of incorporating polarimetric information in sea ice charting. The objective of the second paper was to explore the transferability of information from one scene to another. Three overlapping scenes from consecutive days were automatically segmented. Utilising one scene as reference, two strategies for labelling the other scenes were explored. The analysis showed that under stable environmental conditions and an incidence angle difference of ∼ 7 ◦ between the reference scene and the test scene, the results were reasonable. In the third paper we investigated the classification potential of 44 polarimetric features. Ground-truth pixels were manually selected and input to an automatic feature selection process. The feature subsets were input to classifier and evaluated based on the number of correctly classified pixels. The best feature subset included six features. These achieved a classification accuracy of 70 %, reflecting the complexity of the scen...|$|R

40|$|Electronic charts {{are a new}} {{navigation}} {{aid that}} can provide significant benefits to maritime navigationsafety, and commerce. More than simply a computer graphics display, electronic chart systems combine both geographic and textual data into a readily useful <b>operational</b> tool. Electronic <b>charts</b> are a real-time navigation system that integrates a variety of information that is displayed and interpreted by the mariner. IHO Special Publication 52 (IHO-S- 52) is the IHO Specification for Chart Content and Display of ECDIS. It includes appendices describing the means/process for updating, color and symbol specifications. Electronic charts automate the process of integrating real-time positions with the chart display and allow the navigator to continuously assess the position and safety of the vessel. This paper discussed the key problems, which will provide the theoretical foundation and practical experience. On the bases of analyzing the S- 52 standard, this paper discussed the key technology in the Electronic chart display system, including such follows: Propose a new automatic assignment symbols which consist of points, lines and areas. According to the S- 57 standard and S- 52 standard, it is decided by the objects attribute when a symbol was shown. In {{order to meet the}} mariner’s evolving requirements, it should be designed with enough flexibility. It contains conditional symbology procedures for cases where symbolizing depends on circumstance, such as the mariner can select a safety depth or safety contour. For a safety depth, all soundings {{less than or equal to}} the safety depth are emphasized. For a safety contour, ECDIS highlights this contour over other depth contours.
