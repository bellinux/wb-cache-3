5|$|The human ear {{consists}} of three parts—the <b>outer</b> <b>ear,</b> middle ear and inner ear. The ear canal of the <b>outer</b> <b>ear</b> is separated from the air-filled tympanic cavity {{of the middle ear}} by the eardrum. The middle ear contains the three small bones—the ossicles—involved in the transmission of sound, and is connected to the throat at the nasopharynx, via the pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube. The inner ear contains the otolith organs—the utricle and saccule—and the semicircular canals belonging to the vestibular system, as well as the cochlea of the auditory system.|$|E
5|$|During {{embryogenesis}} the ear develops {{as three}} distinct structures: the inner ear, {{the middle ear}} and the <b>outer</b> <b>ear.</b> Each structure originates from a different germ layer: the ectoderm, endoderm and mesenchyme.|$|E
5|$|Sound that {{travels through}} the <b>outer</b> <b>ear</b> {{impacts on the}} eardrum, and causes it to vibrate. The three {{ossicles}} bones transmit this sound to a second window (the oval window) which protects the fluid-filled inner ear. In detail, the pinna of the <b>outer</b> <b>ear</b> helps to focus a sound, which impacts on the eardrum. The malleus rests on the membrane, and receives the vibration. This vibration is transmitted along the incus and stapes to the oval window. Two small muscles, the tensor tympani and stapedius, also help modulate noise. The two muscles reflexively contract to dampen excessive vibrations. Vibration of the oval window causes vibration of the endolymph within the vestibule and the cochlea.|$|E

5|$|Hearing loss may {{be either}} partial or total. This {{may be a}} result of injury or damage, {{congenital}} disease, or physiological causes. When hearing loss is a result of injury or damage to the <b>outer</b> <b>ear</b> or middle ear, it is known as conductive hearing loss. When deafness is a result of injury or damage to the inner ear, vestibulochoclear nerve, or brain, it is known as sensorineural hearing loss.|$|E
5|$|The <b>outer</b> <b>ear</b> is {{supplied}} {{by a number}} of arteries. The posterior auricular artery provides the majority of the blood supply. The anterior auricular arteries provide some supply to the outer rim of the ear and scalp behind it. The posterior auricular artery is a direct branch of the external carotid artery, and the anterior auricular arteries are branches from the superficial temporal artery. The occipital artery also plays a role.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle ear}} lies between the <b>outer</b> <b>ear</b> {{and the inner}} ear. It {{consists}} of an air-filled cavity called the tympanic cavity and includes the three ossicles and their attaching ligaments; the auditory tube; and the round and oval windows. The ossicles are three small bones that function together to receive, amplify, and transmit the sound from the eardrum to the inner ear. The ossicles are the malleus (hammer), incus (anvil), and the stapes (stirrup). The stapes is the smallest named bone in the body. The middle ear also connects to the upper throat at the nasopharynx via the pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube.|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo report {{use of the}} Vibrant Soundbridge (VSB) in {{patients}} with congenital deformation of the middle and <b>outer</b> <b>ears</b> and investigate its utility in this patient population. MethodFour patients with congenital deformation of middle and <b>outer</b> <b>ears</b> underwent VSB implantation. All were male (aged 3 - 18 years, average 13. 5 years) and operated on the left side. Malformation was bilateral in 3 patients and unilateral in 1 patient. Surgical techniques were modified to accommodate each patient's unique conditions and needs. The implant site was approached via the facial recess in 3 patients and through a retro-facial nerve route in 1 patient. The VSB implant was connected to either the stapes (2 cases) or the round window (2 cases). Pure tone and speech audiometry results and daily communication capabilities before and after VSB activation were compared. ResultsThe operations were successful in all patients, with no complications. The patient communication level improved significantly after VSB activation. Average air conduction pure tone threshold or conditioned reflex audiometry threshold improved by 35 dB in the 0. 25 - 4 kHz range, from 69 dB HL before VSB activation to 34 dB HL after. The sentence recognition rate in quiet at 65 dB SPL went up to 86 % from 0 % without VSB for patients with bilateral deformation and remained at 100 % for the patient with unilateral deformity. However, for the latter patient, the rate improved to 20 % from 0 % without VSB in noise (- 8 dB SNR). ConclusionVSB is an excellent solution for improving hearing {{in patients}} with congenital deformation of middle and <b>outer</b> <b>ears.</b> Operation can be completed and good results can be achieved even in patients with unique conditions and needs...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} a placebo-controlled study of {{transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation}} (TENS) {{applied to the}} contralateral lower leg and <b>outer</b> <b>ears</b> of an amputee with non-painful phantom sensations. The subject received TENS or placebo stimulation on separate sessions in which baseline periods of no stimulation alternated with periods of TENS (or placebo). Throughout the two sessions, continuous measures of stump skin conductance, surface skin temperature and phantom intensity were obtained. The results showed that TENS applied to the contralateral leg was significantly more effective than a placebo in decreasing the intensity of phantom sensations, whereas stimulation of the <b>outer</b> <b>ears</b> led to a non-significant increase. The pattern of electrodermal activity on the TENS session was consistently linear during baseline periods, indicating a progressive increase in sympathetic sudomotor activity. In contrast, during periods of electrical stimulation the pattern of electrodermal activity was consistently curvilinear indicating an initial decrease followed by an increase in sudomotor responses. Changes in stump skin conductance correlated significantly with changes in phantom sensations both in TENS and placebo sessions suggesting a relationship between sympathetic activity at the stump and paresthesias referred to the phantom. Two hypotheses are presented to account for these findings...|$|R

5|$|The three {{ossicles}} transmit {{sound from}} the <b>outer</b> <b>ear</b> to the inner ear. The malleus receives vibrations from sound pressure on the eardrum, where it is connected at its longest part (the manubrium or handle) by a ligament. It transmits vibrations to the incus, which in turn transmits the vibrations to the small stapes bone. The wide base of the stapes rests on the oval window. As the stapes vibrates, vibrations are transmitted through the oval window, causing movement of fluid within the cochlea.|$|E
5|$|Two sets {{of muscles}} are {{associated}} with the outer ear: the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles. In some mammals, these muscles can adjust the direction of the pinna. In humans, these muscles have little or no effect. The ear muscles are supplied by the facial nerve, which also supplies sensation to the skin of the ear itself, {{as well as to the}} external ear cavity. The great auricular nerve, auricular nerve, auriculotemporal nerve, and lesser and greater occipital nerves of the cervical plexus all supply sensation to parts of the <b>outer</b> <b>ear</b> and the surrounding skin.|$|E
5|$|Miniopterus manavi is a {{diminutive}} species with fur of medium length. The upperparts are blackish or reddish brown. Other small Malagasy Miniopterus are lighter. The ears mostly lack hair and {{end in a}} rounded tip. The tragus (a projection {{on the inner side}} of the <b>outer</b> <b>ear)</b> is thin for most of its length, ends in an angular tip, and has a flange at the medial side (towards the midline of the animal). The tragus is differently shaped in other species. The wings and uropatagium (tail membrane) are blackish and are attached to the upper leg at the same level, above the ankle. The uropatagium is densely haired above and more sparsely below, as in M.mahafaliensis and M.brachytragos; M.griveaudi and M.aelleni have more nearly naked uropatagia.|$|E
50|$|Spinose ear ticks are a {{constant}} source of annoyance and irritation for their definitive hosts. Their tendency to occur in large numbers can cause ulceration of the inner ear, high sensitivity of the ears, large amounts of blood loss, and even deafness.

Several cases of human infestation have been reported, and the tick has been incriminated in some instances of pathogen transmission.|$|R
40|$|Biodiversity is {{a notable}} outcome of {{biological}} evolution. In {{the process of}} adaptive radiation, functional principles of sensing in biology have been adapted to suit different tasks and constraints. The biosonar system of bats {{is an example of}} such an adaptive radiation in sensing that also offers particularly advantageous conditions for a biodiversity-level analysis of adaptation principles with potential engineering relevance. The beamforming capabilities of bat biosonar are tied to the geometries of external baffle structures, i. e., the <b>outer</b> <b>ears</b> used for reception and the noseleaves used to shape the emitted biosonar pulses. Since the geometries of these baffles determine their functions, which in turn can also be expressed by a shape (the beampattern), biosonar beamforming can be described by two interrelated shape spaces, one for biological form and the other for biological function. A shape space representation for the <b>outer</b> <b>ears</b> can be obtained by a cylindrical transform of the ear surfaces followed by principal component analysis. The results of this analysis are in a form that is suitable to inform the design of technical baffle shapes. However, additional analysis methods need to be developed for noseleaves, beampatterns, as well as the link between form and function. ∗ Address all correspondence to this author...|$|R

5|$|A {{medium-sized}} gray bat, Myotis escalerai {{is similar}} to Myotis nattereri. The fur is long and soft; with a brown tone on the back, and the brighter underparts approaching white. The feet are dark gray. Much of the face is pink, and the muzzle is pointed, with long hairs on the upper lip resembling a moustache. The long ears are brown to gray. The tragus, a projection {{on the inner side}} of the <b>outer</b> <b>ear,</b> is long and reaches {{to the middle of the}} ear and colored gray to yellow, becoming darker from the base towards the tip. According to several authors, it differs from M.nattereri in showing a distinct fringe of hairs on the tail membrane, but bat specialist A.M. Hutson writes that this feature does not distinguish the two species. In addition, the presence of an S-shaped spur on the uropatagium (membrane between the hind legs), which approaches the middle of the membrane, is a distinctive feature of this species. With its broad wings, low flight, and rapid wingbeats, the species is capable of precise, agile flight.|$|E
5|$|Anomalies and malformations of the pinna are common. These {{anomalies}} include chromosome syndromes such as ring 18. Children {{may also}} present cases of abnormal ear canals and low ear implantation. In rare cases no pinna is formed (atresia), or is extremely small (microtia). Small pinnae can develop when the auricular hillocks do not develop properly. The ear canal can fail to develop {{if it does}} not channelise properly or if there is an obstruction. Reconstructive surgery to treat hearing loss is considered as an option for children older than five, with a cosmetic surgical procedure to reduce the size or change the shape of the ear is called an otoplasty. The initial medical intervention is aimed at assessing the baby's hearing and the condition of the ear canal, as well as the middle and inner ear. Depending on the results of tests, reconstruction of the <b>outer</b> <b>ear</b> is done in stages, with planning for any possible repairs {{of the rest of the}} ear.|$|E

The tragus (a projection {{on the inner side}} of the <b>outer</b> <b>ear)</b> is long and has a broad base with a crest at the side, and ends in a blunt to slightly rounded tip. In M.manavi and M.griveaudi, in contrast, the base is narrower, in M.mahafaliensis, the sides of the tragus are parallel, and M.brachytragus has a short, blunt tragus sparsely covered with hair. The wing membrane is also brown, but the uropatagium is lighter. The wing membrane and uropatagium are attached to the upper leg at the same level, above the ankle. The uropatagium is sparsely covered with thin, but clearly visible hairs. In contrast, M.manavi, M.mahafaliensis, and M.brachytragos have densely covered uropatagia and that of M.griveaudi is almost naked. Individuals from Anjouan have significantly shorter hindfeet than those from Madagascar, but otherwise the two populations cannot be distinguished on the basis of external characteristics.|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} animal species utilize the {{ultraviolet}} (UV) component of sunlight as their environmental cues, whereas physiological roles of UV photoreception in mammals, especially in human beings, remain open questions. Here {{we report that}} mouse neuropsin (OPN 5) encoded by the Opn 5 gene exhibited an absorption maximum (lmax) at 380 nm when reconstituted with 11 -cis-retinal. Upon UV-light illumination, OPN 5 was converted to a blue-absorbing photoproduct (lmax 470 nm), which was stable {{in the dark and}} reverted to the UV-absorbing state by the subsequent orange light illumination, indicating its bistable nature. Human OPN 5 also had an absorption maximum at 380 nm with spectral properties similar to mouse OPN 5, revealing that OPN 5 is the first and hitherto unknown human opsin with peak sensitivity in the UV region. OPN 5 was capable of activating heterotrimeric G protein Gi in a UV-dependent manner.
