5|$|Zero Mission is {{the first}} game in the Metroid series to include a {{sequence}} in which the player controls Samus without her Power Suit. In {{this portion of the}} game, Samus is more vulnerable to damage, must crawl through ducts <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> without the help of her Morph Ball mode, and has a weak pistol that briefly stuns enemies as her only weapon. However, Samus retains all energy tanks she acquired previously.|$|E
25|$|On March 26, 2004, Austin {{allegedly}} assaulted {{his girlfriend}} Tess Broussard during a dispute at his Texas home, {{according to a}} San Antonio Police Department report. Broussard claimed that Austin grabbed her, and she began struggling with him, who eventually threw her to the ground. Broussard landed <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees,</b> and later told officers she had injured her right hand. Broussard provided a written statement to police, who photographed her injuries.|$|E
25|$|Kate {{heard the}} crash, and knew an {{eastbound}} passenger train {{was due in}} Moingona about midnight, stopping shortly before heading east over the Des Moines River and then Honey Creek. She found the surviving crew members and shouted that she would get help, having to cross the Des Moines River bridge along the way. Although she started with a lantern, it went out, and she crawled the span <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> with only lightning for illumination. Once across, she had to cover about two miles on ground to the Moingona depot to sound the alarm. She then led a party back to rescue two of the crew members. Edgar Wood, perched in a tree, grasped a rope thrown to him, and came ashore hand-over-hand. Adam Agar couldn't be reached until the floodwaters began to recede. Pat Donahue's corpse was eventually found in a cornfield a quarter mile downstream from the bridge, but A.P. Olmsted was never found. The passenger train was stopped at Scranton, with about 200 aboard.|$|E

500|$|Mikami was {{indifferent}} to the main character's gender. During the early creation process, he left the decision to his staff, who ultimately chose a female character. Because P.N.03 {{takes place in a}} space colony, Mikami wanted Vanessa's country of origin to be ambiguous. To that end, she was given a combination of French, German, and English names. Vanessa's movements were animated freehand, without motion capture technology. The designers posed Vanessa crouched <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> to resemble a jaguar, as an homage to the Jaguar title. The staff integrated rhythmic motions to her maneuvers to emulate dancing and to make her appear stylish. Kobayashi wanted Vanessa to be a [...] "cool and sexy mercenary with a tough exterior that hides her dark past." [...] In retrospect, he was proud of the character's style and movements.|$|E
2500|$|A November 6, 1971, cartoon in The New Yorker by Whitney Darrow, Jr. shows a {{cleaning}} lady <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> scrubbing an office floor while saying to another one: [...] "I'd {{like to see}} George Plimpton do this sometime." [...] In another cartoon in The New Yorker, a patient {{looks up at the}} masked surgeon about to operate on him and asks, [...] "Wait a minute! How do I know you're not George Plimpton?" [...] A feature in Mad Magazine titled [...] "Some Really Dangerous Jobs for George Plimpton" [...] spotlighted him trying to swim across Lake Erie, strolling through New York's Times Square {{in the middle of the}} night, and spending a day with Jerry Lewis.|$|E
2500|$|According to the prosecution, Knox had {{attacked}} Kercher in her bedroom, repeatedly banged {{her head against}} a wall, forcefully held her face, and tried to strangle her. Mignini suggested Knox had taunted Kercher and may have said, [...] "You acted the goody-goody so much, now {{we are going to}} show you. Now you're going to be forced to have sex!" [...] The prosecution theorized that Guede, Knox, and Sollecito had removed Kercher's jeans, and held her <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> while Guede sexually abused her; that Knox had cut Kercher with a knife before inflicting the fatal stab wound; and that she had then stolen Kercher's mobile phones and money to fake a burglary. On 5December 2009, Knox and Sollecito were convicted of murder and sentenced to 26 years' imprisonment.|$|E
60|$|Now it chanced that Gudruda had rested <b>her</b> chin <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> {{was gazing}} into Eric's eyes beneath {{the shadow of}} her hair.|$|R
60|$|The {{last words}} were whispered hurriedly; Lillian saw the glitter of an antique ring, felt {{the touch of}} bearded lips <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> Paul was gone.|$|R
60|$|Mary rested <b>her</b> cheek <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> {{looked at}} him with her grave steady face, not very much discomposed after the first glimpse of his meaning.|$|R
60|$|And then Ustane crept {{past her}} <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees,</b> and went.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll pick 'em up, ma'am," [...] cried Kitty, {{who loved}} to be useful; and down she went <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees,</b> and {{carefully}} picked up every runaway.|$|E
60|$|The old woman, who {{appeared}} to have been subdued by exhaustion, crept <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> to her side, and laying her head on her daughter's breast, moaned piteously.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Except {{the best}} sort,' tenderly whispered Violet. Theodora rested <b>her</b> head <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> {{remained}} perfectly still for some moments, then looked up, {{and spoke in}} a depressed voice.|$|R
50|$|Pantha's human/panther {{physiology}} {{gave her}} superhuman strength, speed, and agility, {{as well as}} heightened senses (such as hearing, smelling, and night-vision), enhanced reflexes, <b>and</b> retractable claws <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> feet.|$|R
60|$|She rose <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees,</b> and waited, {{looking up}} intently into my face. In that attitude--more {{like a dog}} than a human being--she {{repeated}} her customary petition {{when she wanted to}} fix words that interested her in her mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then you may stay." [...] Cornelia {{turned and}} marched {{out of the}} parlor with a state that failed her more and more, the higher she mounted toward her room. If {{it had been a}} flight further she would have had to crawl <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'They don't {{keep this}} room so tidy as the other,' Alice thought to herself, as she noticed {{several of the}} chessmen down in the hearth among the cinders: but in another moment, with a little 'Oh!' of surprise, she was down <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> {{watching}} them. The chessmen were walking about, two and two! ...|$|E
60|$|Lonely {{and miserable}} {{she sat down}} by the fire and stared into the red embers. Then, flinging the feather from her hair, she put <b>her</b> head <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> sobbed passionately.|$|R
60|$|Do√±a Mercedes rose without replying, {{and left}} the room. The lovely enthusiast dropped <b>her</b> head <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> {{remained}} silent, taking no notice of me, a cloud of sorrow <b>on</b> <b>her</b> countenance.|$|R
6000|$|She rested <b>her</b> elbow <b>on</b> <b>her</b> knee <b>and</b> <b>her</b> chin <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> {{took that}} problem under deep consideration. Presently {{she looked up}} and answered, with a rising {{inflection}} implying a shade of uncertainty, ...|$|R
60|$|When he {{scrambled}} {{to his feet}} again Hetty {{was sitting in the}} snow close by him, and Flora Schuyler creeping out of a wreath of it <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees.</b> The sleigh lay on one side, not far away, with the Badger rolling and kicking amidst a tangle of harness, though the other horse was still upon its feet.|$|E
60|$|She shuddered to {{approach}} the pit; but she crept towards it <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees,</b> and called to him as loud as she could call. She listened, but no sound replied. She called again and listened; still no answering sound. She did this, twenty, thirty times. She took a little clod of earth from the broken ground where he had stumbled, and threw it in. She could not hear it fall.|$|E
6000|$|I entreated her {{to wait a}} little; I {{tried to}} place her in a chair. She pushed me contemptuously away, and went {{down on the floor}} <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees.</b> [...] "I shall find him," [...] she said to herself; [...] "I shall find him in spite of them!" [...] She began to crawl over the floor, feeling the empty space before her with her hand. It was horrible. I {{followed}} her, and raised her again, by main force.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{they may}} want to settle something," [...] she replied vaguely, putting <b>her</b> feet <b>on</b> the ground, resting <b>her</b> chin <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> looking out of her large dark eyes contemplatively at the fire.|$|R
60|$|John laughed, {{and watched}} her for a minute, as she poised a pretty little {{preparation}} of lace <b>and</b> flowers <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> regarded it with the genuine interest which his harangue had failed to waken.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said the}} lady, resting <b>her</b> cheek <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> gazing <b>on</b> the fire, [...] "it's all very interesting; and so odd that you two men, with {{nearly the same}} experiences, should be neighbors." ...|$|R
60|$|There was a {{woman sitting}} on the stairs, either asleep or forlorn, whose head was bent down <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees.</b> As {{it was not easy}} to pass without {{treading}} on her, and as she was perfectly regardless of his near approach, he stopped, and touched her on the shoulder. Looking up, she showed him quite a young face, but one whose bloom and promise were all swept away, as if the haggard winter should unnaturally kill the spring.|$|E
60|$|Pretty {{soon she}} had to duck her head to pass under the fence that {{separated}} the meadow from the pasture lot; but she got through all right, and then kept on down the stream, until she came close to the deep pool. She couldn't wade through this, as I have explained; so she got on dry land and crept <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> {{up to the edge}} of the bank, so as not to scare the fishes, if any were swimming in the pool.|$|E
6000|$|I took a carving-knife {{from off}} the table, and {{standing}} over her I brought it down gently {{on top of}} her head. [...] "Rise, Sir Jane Puddle," [...] said I, to which the maid gave a smothered gasp, and--would you believe it, madam?--she crept out of the room <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees.</b> The cook waited on us at breakfast, and I truly believe that the landlord and his wife {{breathed a sigh of relief}} when we left the Ship Inn, for their sordid souls had never heard of knighthood, but knew all about assassination.|$|E
6000|$|The {{little girl}} stirred in her berth, and then lifted herself <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> stared round at them through her tangled golden hair. [...] "Is it morning, yet?" [...] she asked sleepily. [...] "Is it to-morrow?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{kindness}} and sympathy in her tone broke Marcella down. Tears rushed to her eyes. She bowed <b>her</b> head <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> said sobbingly, [...] "Oh, I am tired! But it's not that. I'm--I'm in such trouble." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A-huh!" [...] ejaculated Bo. Then {{she rolled}} over, not without groans, and, once upon her face, she raised herself <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> {{turned to a}} sitting posture. [...] "Where's everybody?... Oh, Nell, it's {{perfectly}} lovely here. Paradise!" ...|$|R
