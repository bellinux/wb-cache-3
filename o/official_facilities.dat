6000|$|I wish {{to express}} my {{gratitude}} for certain good offices which Augustus secured for me in January, 1917. I {{had been invited to}} visit the theatre of war in Flanders by the Commander-in-Chief: an invitation which was, under the circumstances, a summons to duty. Thus I had occasion to spend some days in procuring the necessary passport and other <b>official</b> <b>facilities</b> for my journey. It happened just then that the Stage Society gave a performance of this little play. It opened the heart of every official to me. I have always been treated with distinguished consideration in my contracts with bureaucracy during the war; but on this occasion I found myself persona grata in the highest degree. There was only one word when the formalities were disposed of; and that was [...] "We are up against Augustus all day." [...] The showing-up of Augustus scandalized one or two innocent and patriotic critics who regarded the prowess of the British army as inextricably bound up with Highcastle prestige. But our Government departments knew better: their problem was how to win the war with Augustus on their backs, well-meaning, brave, patriotic, but obstructively fussy, self-important, imbecile, and disastrous.|$|E

50|$|After {{the fall}} of the last {{military}} junta and the return to democracy in 1983, the building continued to serve its official functions, until 2001, when human rights organizations demanded that it be preserved. On 2001-03-22 the Ministry of Government of the province of Santa Fe dictated Resolution No. 0060 to fulfill this request. The <b>official</b> <b>facilities</b> were dismantled and the police headquarters were moved elsewhere. A part of the building was given to municipal control, another one was turned into a delegation of the provincial government, and the central courtyard became an open public square.

It now hosts a memorial exhibition managed by relatives of victims of forced disappearance.|$|E
5000|$|In 1994, {{channels}} of communication were opened with Israel through the Belgian embassies in Tel Aviv and Tunis. Tunisian Foreign Minister Habib Ben Yahia and then-Israeli Foreign Minister Ehud Barak met in Barcelona in 1995 to expand official {{relations between the two}} countries after relations had been confined to [...] "two communications channels" [...] in the Belgian embassies in each of Tunis and Tel Aviv. On Jan. 22, 1996, then US Secretary of State Warren Christopher announced [...] "that for the first time Israel and Tunisia will establish <b>official</b> <b>facilities</b> called [...] "interests sections" [...] in each other's countries. By April 15 of this year, each nation will host representatives of the other government so as to facilitate political consultations, travel, and trade between their two countries". According to plan, Israel opened an interest office in Tunisia in April and six weeks later, in May, Tunisian diplomat Khemaies Jhinaoui went to Israel to open his country's interest office in Tel Aviv.Relations worsened in the early 2000s after the start of the Second Intifada. On October 22, 2000, President Ben Ali announced that he would break all diplomatic ties with Israel following the [...] "violence in the Palestinian-controlled territories". Israel expressed its disappointment at the Tunisian decision to sever relations and close the interest offices in Tel Aviv and Tunis. The Israeli Foreign Ministry said: [...] "It appears that Tunisia has elected to renounce its potential role as a bridge for dialogue between Israel and its neighbours, thereby harming the critical effort to promote regional peace." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{airport was}} named after a person, M. Graham Clark, and the {{donation}} agreement between the college and the county calls for the airport to always be named M. Graham Clark Field, though it is usually referred to as Clark Field, or simply as [...] "Clark." [...] The <b>official</b> <b>Facilities</b> Directory lists the airport {{under the name of}} the town it was originally officially associated with, Point Lookout, so some pilots will refer to the airport as [...] "Point Lookout." [...] The Kansas City Sectional Chart depicts the airport as [...] "Clark-Taney County", but on two lines, so some pilots refer to it as [...] "Clark County." [...] Some local pilots refer to it as [...] "Taney County." [...] Some transient pilots associating the airport with the principal city of Branson refer to it as [...] "Branson," [...] despite the proximity of the newly developed Branson Airport about eight miles to the southeast. Most recently, there has been a proposal to officially rename the airport as [...] "M. Graham Clark Branson Downtown Taney County Airport" [...] as a marketing move to attract some of the low end corporate traffic from nearby Boone County Airport or the Branson Airport. Although the airport board has never adopted the proposal, many local pilots pushing for the change have been referring to the airport as [...] "Branson Downtown" [...] or simply [...] "Downtown". The use of so many names for the same airport has also been known to cause radio confusion in dense traffic. It is not unusual for approaching traffic making an initial call to refer to the airport as [...] "Clark Point Lookout Branson Downtown Taney County [...] [...] [...]" [...] in an attempt to be specific, and use a shorter name on subsequent calls.|$|E
40|$|In {{view of the}} {{upcoming}} Sydney Olympics and several recent reports describing the experience at the Atlantic Olympics, we report {{the findings of the}} only Australian study which, to our knowledge, measured the impact of a large-scale sporting event on a public hospital. The study also provided an avenue for increased surveillance for communicable diseases. We prospectively assessed the utilisation of the Royal Darwin Hospital (RDH) by visiting athletes, officials and spectators during the 1997 Arafura Games, a biannual, seven-day international sporting event which attracts some 4, 000 athletes and their supporters from across Australia, South-East Asia and the Pacific.

40|$|Three {{types of}} medical {{systems can be}} {{identified}} in Cambodia : the western biomedical sector, either public or private; the traditional practice, recorded on manuscripts, {{of a group of}} mainly male specialists, the kru Khmer; and the folk methods, combining herbal, ritual and increasingly pharmaceutical components, that women use daily for their families. While the international aid agencies tend to adopt a more positive view of the traditional practionners, women's knowledge about care is widely ignored or even condemned by the professional sector. Yet they are the first health providers in a country plagued by extremely high morbidity incidences and a low utilization rate of the <b>official</b> <b>facilities.</b> While asserting that this contempt for domestic care evolves from a gender-biased evaluation of knowledge, this paper attempts to show why female domestic methods of healing deserve more attention and respect.
