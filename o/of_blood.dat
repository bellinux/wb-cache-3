5|$|The 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin became {{notable for}} a scandal {{involving}} the emerging trend <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> doping, the use <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> transfusions or synthetic hormones such as Erythropoietin (EPO) to improve oxygen flow and thus reduce fatigue. The Italian police conducted {{a raid on}} the Austrian cross-country ski team's residence during the Games where they seized blood-doping specimens and equipment. This event followed the pre-Olympics suspension of 12 cross-country skiers who tested positive for unusually high levels of haemoglobin, which is evidence <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> doping.|$|E

5|$|A few {{vertebrate}} {{species such}} as the Texas horned lizard are able to shoot squirts <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> from their eyes, by rapidly increasing the blood pressure within the eye sockets, if threatened. Because an individual may lose up to 53% <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> in a single squirt, this is only used against persistent predators like foxes, wolves and coyotes (Canidae), as a last defence. Canids often drop horned lizards after being squirted, and attempt to wipe or shake the blood out of their mouths, suggesting that the fluid has a foul taste; they choose other lizards if given the choice, suggesting a learned aversion towards horned lizards as prey.|$|E

5|$|A {{stand-alone}} expansion for Infamous 2, titled Infamous: Festival <b>of</b> <b>Blood,</b> {{was announced}} at Gamescom and released on October 25, 2011. A vampire-themed spinoff, Infamous: Festival <b>of</b> <b>Blood</b> features a non-canon story set in New Marais. The story follows an infected Cole that must kill the vampire which bit him {{in order to}} save his soul. The game featured new enemies and powers. A sequel to Infamous 2, titled Infamous Second Son was announced at PlayStation Meeting 2013 for PlayStation 4 and was released on March 31, 2014 worldwide. The game takes place seven years after Infamous 2 and follows a new protagonist in the city of Seattle.|$|E

5|$|Calcium is an {{essential}} element needed in large quantities. The Ca2+ ion acts as an electrolyte and {{is vital to the}} health of the muscular, circulatory, and digestive systems; is indispensable to the building of bone; and supports synthesis and function <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> cells. For example, it regulates the contraction of muscles, nerve conduction, and the clotting <b>of</b> <b>blood.</b> As a result, intra- and extracellular calcium levels are tightly regulated by the body. Calcium can play this role because the Ca2+ ion forms stable coordination complexes with many organic compounds, especially proteins; it also forms compounds with a wide range of solubilities, enabling the formation of skeletons.|$|E

5|$|Once {{dissection}} has occurred, two mechanisms {{contribute to}} the development of stroke symptoms. Firstly, the flow through the blood vessel may be disrupted due to the accumulation <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> under the vessel wall, leading to ischemia (insufficient blood supply). Secondly, irregularities in the vessel wall and turbulence increase the risk of thrombosis (the formation <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> clots) and embolism (migration) of these clots of the brain. From various lines of evidence, it appears that thrombosis and embolism is the predominant problem.|$|E
5|$|Once microbubbles have formed, {{they can}} grow by either a {{reduction}} in pressure or by diffusion of gas into the gas from its surroundings. In the body, bubbles may be located within tissues or carried along with the bloodstream. The speed <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> flow within a blood vessel {{and the rate of}} delivery <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> to capillaries (perfusion) are the main factors that determine whether dissolved gas is taken up by tissue bubbles or circulation bubbles for bubble growth.|$|E

5|$|Severe {{disease is}} marked by the {{problems}} of capillary permeability (an allowance of fluid and protein normally contained within blood to pass) and disordered blood clotting.

Leaky capillaries (and the critical phase) {{are thought to be}} caused by an immune system response. Other processes of interest include infected cells that become necrotic—which affect both coagulation and fibrinolysis (the opposing systems <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> clotting and clot degradation)—and low platelets in the blood, also a factor in normal clotting.|$|E
