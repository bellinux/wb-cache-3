40|$|In {{the face}} of {{increasing}} water scarcity, reducing the consumptive and degradative water use of crop production is important to produce more food and/or for the environment. The thesis explores the potential for reducing the green, blue and grey water footprint (WF) of irrigated crop production by model-based assessment of different (combinations of) field management practices. First, the effect of management practices on ET and/or nitrogen(N) load to freshwater, and on crop yield are simulated (using AquaCrop or APEX models). The ET is partitioned into its green and blue part by applying a shadow water-balance method, which is developed in the thesis. Then green, blue and grey WF of crop production resulting from different management practices are calculated using the global WF accounting standard. The field management practices considered in this thesis are: four irrigation techniques, four irrigation strategies, three mulching practices, different N-application rates, two forms of nitrogen, and two tillage practices. We analyse various cases, including three crops, four different environments, different hydrologic years (dry to wet), and different soil types. The results show that compared to the reference (furrow and full irrigation without mulching), the maximum reduction in the blue and consumptive WF of crop production {{can be achieved by}} practicing drip/subsurface drip with deficit irrigation and synthetic mulching. Reducing the N-application rate will generally result in a higher reduction of the grey WF per tonne than changing the form of N applied, the tillage practice or the irrigation strategy. For reducing both consumptive WF and grey WF per tonne, one can best apply manure-N instead of inorganic-N, and deficit instead of full irrigation. Trade-offs between crop yield, blue and grey WF are likely: increasing the N-application rate to increase the crop yield to its maximum, decreases the blue WF per tonne, and increases the grey WF per tonne. Aiming at cost-effective consumptive WF reduction, application of marginal cost curves shows that, one can best improve the irrigation strategy first, next the mulching practice can best be changed from no mulching to <b>organic</b> <b>mulching,</b> and finally the irrigation technique from furrow or sprinkler to drip irrigation...|$|E

Six weed management practices were applied comprising two ‘dead’ <b>organic</b> <b>mulching</b> materials (dry shoots of Tithonia diversifolia and dry leaves of Pinus patula) each at 10 cm and 15 cm; solarisation achieved by covering the soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for four weeks; weeding twice (standard farmers practice) and unweeded check. Treatment arrangement was a split plot with crops as main plots and weed control treatments as subplots laid out in a randomized complete block with four replications. The pines mulches (15 cm) produced the highest yield of tomato (49. 3 t/ha) and sweet pepper (27. 9 t/ha). This mulching level was also most effective in suppressing weeds with up to 86 % of weed dry biomass reduction compared to unweeded check. However, weeds of Oxalis spp. managed to penetrate through the pine mulch layer. The 15 cm pine mulch was also the most effective treatment for the control of insects pests with a significant average reduction in a mixed insect population by up to 52 %. Mulching in-creased presence of beneficial comprising of mostly coccinellids, spiders and bees (up to 144 %). Pine mulches was best overall in insect pest control and increased marketability of the fruits by an average of 46. 8 % compared to normal farmers practice.

40|$|Reducing {{the water}} {{footprint}} (WF) {{of the process}} of growing irrigated crops is an indispensable element in water management, particularly in water-scarce areas. To achieve this, information on marginal cost curves (MCCs) that rank management packages according to their cost-effectiveness to reduce the WF need to support the decision making. MCCs enable the estimation of the cost associated with a certain WF reduction target, e. g. towards a given WF permit (expressed in m 3   ha − 1 per season) or to a certain WF benchmark (expressed in m 3   t − 1 of crop). This paper aims to develop MCCs for WF reduction for a range of selected cases. AquaCrop, a soil-water-balance and crop-growth model, is used to estimate the effect of different management packages on evapotranspiration and crop yield and thus the WF of crop production. A management package is defined as a specific combination of management practices: irrigation technique (furrow, sprinkler, drip or subsurface drip); irrigation strategy (full or deficit irrigation); and mulching practice (no, organic or synthetic mulching). The annual average cost for each management package is estimated as the annualized capital cost plus the annual costs of maintenance and operations (i. e. costs of water, energy and labour). Different cases are considered, including three crops (maize, tomato and potato); four types of environment (humid in UK, sub-humid in Italy, semi-arid in Spain and arid in Israel); three hydrologic years (wet, normal and dry years) and three soil types (loam, silty clay loam and sandy loam). For each crop, alternative WF reduction pathways were developed, after which the most cost-effective pathway was selected to develop the MCC for WF reduction. When aiming at WF reduction one can best improve the irrigation strategy first, next the mulching practice and finally the irrigation technique. Moving from a full to deficit irrigation strategy is found to be a no-regret measure: it reduces the WF by reducing water consumption at negligible yield reduction while reducing the cost for irrigation water and the associated costs for energy and labour. Next, moving from no to <b>organic</b> <b>mulching</b> has a high cost-effectiveness, reducing the WF significantly at low cost. Finally, changing from sprinkler or furrow to drip or subsurface drip irrigation reduces the WF, but at a significant cost...|$|E
40|$|Essential oils crops offer high value, low volume end {{products}} for export. Tasmannia lanceolata is currently commercially utilised for its plant extract {{on a small}} scale, but the consistency of yield and quality potentially offered by plantation production of the species {{has the capacity to}} significantly increase the size of the industry. Early attempts at small scale plantation production highlighted the need to understand the ecophysiology of the species. Climatic and nutritional effects on the growth and plant extract yield and quality of the species were investigated in both glasshouse and field trial conditions. Experiments were conducted on growth responses to manipulated levels of light, temperature, wind and nutrients (with separate experiments focusing specifically on the macronutrients N, P and K and fertiliser rate respectively). Further investigations described the pollen structure of T. lanceolata, as well as vectors that may aid in pollination. Temperature and light levels were manipulated in growth cabinets to determine optimal rates of photosynthesis, and stomatal effects. High light levels and temperatures up to 25 °C, positively affected photosynthetic rate. At 25 °C, photosynthetic rate significantly declined and stomatal conductance significantly increased. A wind tunnel was used to test plant photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and plant water potential over three different wind speed treatments (16, 28 and 43 km/h). Photosynthetic rate declined at higher wind speeds, while stomatal conductance and plant water potential increased at higher wind speeds, while plants were kept at a constant temperature (20 °C). Two field trials with three mulch treatments (bare soil, organic mulch and plastic mulch) and two shelter treatments (with and without tree guards) were applied at two sites. Tree guards increased height and stem circumference after 12 months at both sites on all mulch treatments. Plastic matting and <b>organic</b> <b>mulching</b> increased plant height at one site, while organic mulch significantly increased height of plants over bare soil at the other site. Photosynthetic rates of plants were increased by tree guards under both low and high ambient light conditions. Yield of the most important plant extract component, polygodial, was unaffected by tree guards. Three levels of N, P and K were applied to potted plants in a glasshouse over a 10 month period. The highest application level of N (20 mM) achieved the most growth, with considerably increased plant height, leaf number and stem circumference, along with greater yields of polygodial as a percentage of dry matter. Higher rates of N together with lower rates of P produced particularly strong growth. No advances in growth were achieved above the medium level applications of K (6 mM) and P (1 mM), and oil yield was significantly lowered at the highest treatment levels of both K (12 mM) and P (2 mM). Five levels of Osmocote Plus Trace Elements were applied to glasshouse grown plants to better understand the effects of total nutrient levels, including nutrients other than N, P and K. Plant height, leaf number and stem width were all affected by fertiliser treatments, with greatest plant height at the highest fertiliser rate but not greatest leaf number or stem width. The lowest fertiliser rate produced a significantly higher extract yield than higher fertiliser treatments, but significantly lower plant growth. Polygodial yield as a proportion of oil yield was unaffected by fertiliser rate. Plant pollen was analysed and pollination was examined in the species. Although a single pollen grain was identified on the leg of a muscoid fly, no positive identification was made that this represented the main pollination vector. Gas chromatography of male and female flower samples indicated very strong similarities between the two, however no compounds were identified that could lead to positive determination of suitable pollination vectors based on known pheromone preferences. Insect traps were laid out in the field to look specifically at the role of native bees in the pollination of T. lanceolata, however no positive identification was made of their role in pollination. The research conducted for this thesis showed that understanding the ecophysiological implications and managing for high winds and temperature will be key to site selection and the implementation of successful commercial production systems, and that adequate and carefully targeted nutrition will be essential for optimising growth and plant extract yield. Critical nutrient values identified in this study will aid in calibrating fertiliser rates for commercial production...|$|E

In the region of Sofia, a 2 -years field experiment for growing broccoli with covering the soil surface was carried out. Different <b>organic</b> <b>mulches</b> were overspread by layer of 5 cm thickness. Data was collected {{about the effect of}} mulching on weed infestation. The weeds were divided into two groups – monocotyledons and dicotyledons and their weight was measured. It was found out that there were differences in the level of weed infestation between the control (without mulching) and the variants with different <b>organic</b> <b>mulches...</b>|$|R

Bright prospects for palm oil commodity in the world encourage people to plant oil palm in acidic mineral soil, which could face some obstacles, on physical, chemical and biological soil properties. In the dry season, oil palm has the type of oil palm roots are shallow making it relatively less tolerant to drought. Because of these problems {{is an attempt to}} solve the problem in oil palm land by using <b>organic</b> <b>mulch</b> (oil palm empty fruit bunches, Calopogonium, palm midrib and ferns). This research has been carried out in the experimental farm of the Agriculture Faculty Riau University, from June to September 2012. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effect of <b>organic</b> <b>mulch</b> on soil physical and chemical properties, as well as the root growth of palm oil using a randomized block design (RBD), that consists of 5 treatments and 3 replications. The results of this study shown that treated soil using <b>organic</b> <b>mulch</b> had the significant difference compare to soil without mulch in the whole observation parameters. <b>Organic</b> <b>mulches</b> can improve total pore space, C-organic, N-total, soil water content and soil temperature and decrease soil bulk density. It also, can increase the weight of the roots, root dry weight, root occupy and the plant root volume...|$|R

Scope of better utilization of soil moisture was documented through all the mulches, especially during initial crop growth stages, when the moisture content was 1 - 3 % higher in mulches. Soil temperature was more moderate under <b>organic</b> <b>mulches.</b> Paddy husk recorded significantly higher plant biomass, while the effect of mulching in enhancing root growth was clearly documented. <b>Organic</b> <b>mulches</b> produced more roots (25 and 40 % higher root weight and root length densities compared to no-mulch) in sub-surface (> 0. 15 m) layers, probably due to greater retention of soil moisture in deeper layers and relatively narrow range of soil temperature changes under these systems. Incremental N dose significantly improved all the plant parameters in both mulch and no-mulch treatments. Grain yield was 13 - 21 % higher under mulch and so with increasing N levels. Nitrogen uptake was higher in <b>organic</b> <b>mulches</b> and also with higher N doses, while polyethylene mulch showed mixed trend. Mulches were effective in reducing 3 - 11 % crop water use and improved its efficiency by 25 %. Grain yield and biomass were well-correlated with leaf area index (r= 0. 87 and 0. 91, respectively) and water use was better correlated with root length than its weight. Results indicated substantial improvement in water and N use efficiency and crop growth in wheat under surface <b>mulching,</b> and the <b>organic</b> <b>mulches,</b> especially rice husk performed better than synthetic <b>mulches.</b> <b>Organic</b> and synthetic <b>mulch</b> Crop growth N uptake Water use Wheat...|$|R
