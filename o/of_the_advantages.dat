5|$|Double hulls {{have become}} {{popular in the}} past ten years. Designing a vessel with double sides adds {{primarily}} to its breadth, since bulkers are already required to have double bottoms. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> of the double hull is to make room to place all the structural elements in the sides, removing them from the holds. This increases the volume of the holds, and simplifies their structure which helps in loading, unloading, and cleaning. Double sides also improve a ship's capacity for ballasting, which is useful when carrying light goods: the ship may have to increase its draft for stability or seakeeping reasons, which is done by adding ballast water.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, the Marine Racecar Board of the National Academy of Science {{conducted}} a survey of industry experts regarding {{the pros and cons}} of double-hull design. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> of the double-hull design that were mentioned include ease of ballasting in emergency situations, reduced practice of saltwater ballasting in cargo tanks decreases corrosion, increased environmental protection, cargo discharge is quicker, more complete and easier, tank washing is more efficient, and better protection in low-impact collisions and grounding.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{innovations}} of the Dewey Decimal system {{was that of}} positioning books on the shelves {{in relation to other}} books on similar topics. When the system was first introduced, most libraries in the US used fixed positioning: each book was assigned a permanent shelf position based on the book's height and date of acquisition. Library stacks were generally closed to all but the most privileged patrons, so shelf browsing was not considered of importance. The use of the Dewey Decimal system increased during the early 20th century as librarians were convinced <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> of relative positioning and of open shelf access for patrons.|$|E

5|$|Oxygen {{toxicity}} is {{a catastrophic}} hazard in diving, because a seizure results in near certain death by drowning. The seizure may occur suddenly {{and with no}} warning symptoms. The effects are sudden convulsions and unconsciousness, during which victims can lose their regulator and drown. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> of a full-face diving mask is prevention of regulator loss {{in the event of}} a seizure. As there is an increased risk of central nervous system oxygen toxicity on deep dives, long dives and dives where oxygen-rich breathing gases are used, divers are taught to calculate a maximum operating depth for oxygen-rich breathing gases, and cylinders containing such mixtures must be clearly marked with that depth.|$|E
5|$|The {{final results}} of the Italian {{campaign}} were limited in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> gained by the Empire. The city of Ancona became a Byzantine base in Italy, accepting the Emperor as sovereign. The Normans of Sicily had been damaged and now came {{to terms with the}} Empire, ensuring peace for the rest of Manuel's reign. The Empire's ability to get involved in Italian affairs had been demonstrated. However, given the enormous quantities of gold which had been lavished on the project, it also demonstrated the limits of what money and diplomacy alone could achieve. The expense of Manuel's involvement in Italy must have cost the treasury a great deal (probably more than 2,160,000 hyperpyra or 30,000 pounds of gold), and yet it produced only limited solid gains.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 50percent of midshipmen {{were the}} sons of {{professional}} men, which included {{the sons of}} naval officers, and there were notable sailing families throughout the Age of Sail, such as the Saumarez, Hood, and Parker families. The niceties of preferment and promotion made family connections an obvious advantage for prospective officers. Members of the peerage and landed gentry formed the next largest group, about 27percent of officers. The numbers were smaller, but similarly, their connections gave them excellent prospects for promotion, {{and they had a}} considerable influence on the Royal Navy. A notable member of this group was Prince William, later William IV, who served as a midshipman from 1780–1785. The rest were from commercial or working class backgrounds, and because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> possessed by the nobility and professional sailors, their chances of promotion to lieutenant were slim.|$|E

5|$|The {{nematode}} worm Caenorhabditis elegans, like Drosophila, {{has been}} studied largely because of its importance in genetics. In the early 1970s, Sydney Brenner chose it as a model organism for studying the way that genes control development. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> of working with this worm is that the body plan is very stereotyped: the nervous system of the hermaphrodite contains exactly 302 neurons, always in the same places, making identical synaptic connections in every worm. Brenner's team sliced worms into thousands of ultrathin sections and photographed each one under an electron microscope, then visually matched fibers from section to section, to map out every neuron and synapse in the entire body. The complete neuronal wiring diagram of C.elegans – its connectome was achieved. Nothing approaching this level of detail is available for any other organism, and the information gained has enabled a multitude of studies that would otherwise have not been possible.|$|E
5|$|While at Princeton, she got {{involved}} with the Third World Center (now known as the Carl A. Fields Center), an academic and cultural group that supported minority students, running their day care center, which also included after school tutoring. She challenged the teaching methodology for French because she felt {{that it should be}} more conversational. As part of her requirements for graduation, she wrote a thesis titled Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community. She researched her thesis by sending a questionnaire to African American graduates, requesting they specify when and how comfortable they were with their race prior to their enrollment at Princeton and how they felt about it when they were a student and since then. Of the 400 alumni to whom she sent the survey, fewer than 90 responded, and her findings did not support her hope that the black alumni would still identify with the African American community, even though they had attended an elite university with all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> that accrues to its graduates. She majored in sociology and minored in African American studies, graduating cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in 1985.|$|E

40|$|We analyze a unidimensional {{model of}} two-candidate electoral {{competition}} where voters have im- perfect {{information about the}} candidates' policy proposals, that is, voters cannot observe the exact policy proposals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> candidates but only which candidate offers the most leftist/rightist platform.

In this equilibrium <b>the</b> behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two candidates tends to maximum extremism, due to <b>the</b> voters' lack <b>of</b> information.
