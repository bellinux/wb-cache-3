The former version of the challenged statute operated directly to compensate women for past economic discrimination and was deliberately enacted to compensate women for the particular economic disabilities they suffered. The subsequent amendment of § 415 was not a Congressional admission that its previous policy was invidiously discriminatory. The retired male worker's Fifth Amendment rights were not violated by the prospective application of § 415, as the Constitution did not forbid statutory changes to have a beginning and thus to discriminate between the rights of an earlier and later time.|$|E

This statement is strong and ignores the social perspective. However, if we assume that workers start receiving <b>old-age</b> <b>benefits</b> earlier than when they are no longer able to earn on their own, we neglect the interests of younger workers whose remuneration has to finance this policy (Góra 2013).|$|R

30|$|We {{believe that}} the {{availability}} of old-age benefits affects the job search behaviour and results in premature labour force withdrawal. If a person receives an <b>old-age</b> <b>benefit</b> or perceives it as a forthcoming income option, she can become discouraged from active job search. We focus on the outflow from unemployment to inactivity to check if the discouragement affects unemployed older workers who (soon) decide on retirement. As we analyse the older workers’ behaviour just prior to potential retirement, we do not examine the pure discouraged worker effect. Instead, we extend the traditional definition to look at premature withdrawals from the labour market.|$|E
30|$|We {{examine whether}} easy and early access to old-age {{benefits}} induce older workers to become inactive. We use Polish LFS data.

More males leave the workforce in contractions than re-enter in expansions. If <b>old-age</b> <b>benefit</b> becomes {{the main source of}} income, the worker (after 1  year) is 8 to 20 times more likely to exit the market than unemployment or social welfare beneficiaries. Our findings support higher retirement age—the age when workers become eligible for old-age benefits.|$|E

30|$|We {{primarily}} {{contribute to}} the literature by analysing {{the impact of the}} availability of <b>old-age</b> <b>benefits</b> on the participation of older workers. We check if these benefits tempt workers to exit from the labour force. These benefits may demotivate workers from further job search activity, causing low participation rates. Thus, we extend the definition of the discouraged worker effect and do not refer to pure cyclicality of the labour force participation. In macroeconomic perspective, we seek for the asymmetry in the size and duration of the effect. We find a time-varying discouraged worker effect. The added worker effect prevails at first. Then, the discouraged worker effect arises. It is asymmetric in intensity (stronger in recessions than expansions) and length (certain workers leave the workforce permanently). In a microeconomic perspective, females and older workers are more likely to quit the labour market. The availability of <b>old-age</b> <b>benefits</b> multiplies the probability of withdrawal from the labour market. We perceive our findings as an argument to increase the retirement age, which we understand as the age of the availability of the <b>old-age</b> <b>benefits.</b>|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was {{to find out which}} impacts of the {{parametric}} changes, linked to the change of law no. 155 / 1995 Sb. about pension insurance, as amended, affected the number of applications for early retirement in the Jindřichův Hradec district. The need to solve this problem arose from the questioning of Section 15 of act no. 155 / 1995 Sb., as amended, regarding social insurance, which governs the assignment of the calculation basis used to work out the percentual pension allowance. The Constitutional Court concluded that the defined rules generate significant differences between the amount paid into the insurance system and the amount of the <b>old-age</b> <b>benefit</b> received. On this basis the MPSV (Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs) compiled the rule changes for calculation of <b>old-age</b> <b>benefit</b> and together with the other parametric changes prepared, this was proposed as the so-called ?minor pension reform?. The proposal passed through the legislative process and with effect from 30 th September 2011 the rules for the calculation of the <b>old-age</b> <b>benefit</b> changed according to the new Act (no. 220 / 2011 Sb.) that amends Act no. 155 / 1995 Sb. on social insurance, as amended by subsequent rules, and several other Acts. The new regulations favour citizens with higher incomes. For persons with a lower income the change resulted in lower pensions received, as a result of which some have chosen to apply for early retirement. The {{aim of this}} thesis was to survey applications for all types of retirement in the years 2010 and 2011 with emphasis on the number of applications for early retirement in the district of J. Hradec and to analyse the length of prematurity at the time the application for early retirement was submitted. The comparison periods were the months from March to September of the respective years. Based on the given aims, quantitative research was chosen as the method of standardised research and two hypotheses were tested: 1. As a consequence of the changes in the regulations for the benefit calculation the number of early retirement applications has risen. 2. The highest interest in allowance of early retirement was shown by citizens with a maximum of 1 year left before reaching the age limit at which they were entitled to old-age pension benefits. The research was carried out by content and secondary analysis of data contained in the official statistics of ČSSZ (Czech Social Security Administration) and OSSZ (District Social Security Administration) and other available materials for the years 2010 and 2011. After analysis and evaluation of the required information the first defined hypothesis was confirmed; citizens were choosing early retirement regardless {{of the fact that the}} percentual assessment of the calculation basis would be reduced for every 90 days before retirement age, but were able to retain their original pension calculation basis. They were making this decision despite the fact that by reduction of the received <b>old-age</b> <b>benefit</b> their pension was lowered by approximately 12 %. In this case, providing they satisfied the legal condition of insurance duration, they used the opportunity to retire before reaching the age limit for old-age pension, which meant 3 years early. In the final phase it was confirmed that in the tracked period applications from citizens with up to 1 year left to reach the retirement age did not predominate. The number of applicants retiring 3 years earlier was approximately the same as those with one year left. There were slightly fewer citizens with two years left to satisfy the legal condition of the insurance duration. In the conclusion of the results section, data are also mentioned which evidence the number of state pensions being paid and the expenses used for these benefits from the national budget. This is quite a considerable amount and it continues to rise with the number of pensions being paid...|$|E

40|$|Since Sri Lanka’s {{independence}} in 1948, social welfare for the country’s fishing populations {{has been the}} responsibility of successive governments. During {{the latter half of}} the last millennium, the State has been channelling huge amounts of public funds into a number of social welfare and social security measures. However, the emphasis has mainly been on promotional welfare measures, such as housing, sanitation, infrastructure and training. Among the common problems in the delivery of such measures are regional disparities in the distribution of benefits (with the southern regions receiving the lion’s share), and expenditure on welfare dwindling with a change of government. If social security measures are defined, as by the ILO, to include medical care, sickness benefit, unemployment benefit, <b>old-age</b> <b>benefit,</b> employment injury benefit, family benefit, maternity benefit, invalidity benefit and urvivors’ benefit, then only the Fishermen’s Pension and ocial Security Benefit Scheme provides some kind of social ecurity for Sri Lanka’s fishing populations.

40|$|This {{research}} report seeks {{to answer the}} question of whether <b>old-age</b> <b>benefit</b> rules for women could be altered with the aim not only of ensuring better benefits for older women but also of stimulating fertility. To address this question, a micro-simulation model has been developed. The input data for the model has been drawn from labour force survey data on employment patterns by age, gender, education, numbers of children, variations in the timing of caring for children and wage profiles for five countries: Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Germany. Future retirement benefits are simulated under three variants: variant I uses country-specific labour market data and old-age pension systems; variant II makes use of German labour market data and country-specific old-age pension systems; and finally, variant III refers to country-specific labour market data and the Polish defined-contribution system. Each simulation variant entails four scenarios, which refer to the number of children and the timing of childcare. The simulations show that the effects of differences in old-age systems for retirement benefits are relatively small and that what really matters is the labour market structure, which reflects the impact of children on employment patterns. Therefore, the report concludes that policies aimed at reducing the negative consequences children have on the labour market participation of mothers are recommended for increasing their old-age pensions. This approach would also help to diminish work–family tensions, which in turn could facilitate positive decisions about having children...|$|E

40|$|Given human longevity, fertility, {{health and}} social developments, workers become {{inactive}} relatively early throughout Europe. This partially stems from older workers being pushed out of the labour market and from personal motivation to prefer benefits to wages. We focus on this latter effect and analyse whether workers would have stayed active had they not been tempted by {{the availability of the}} <b>old-age</b> <b>benefits.</b> We focus on Poland, a country severely experiencing the problem of population ageing. In 2013 persons 50 + accounted for 37 % of the total population. Although they enjoy a relatively low unemployment rate, their participation and employment rates are very low: 34 % and 32 %, respectively. We analyse whether {{this is due to the}} discouraged worker effect. We identify the cyclical properties of activity and discouraged worker rates, and estimate a set of logistic regressions to identify the determinants of the exits from the labour market. Cyclical analysis indicates that the added worker effect prevails over the discouraged worker effect. The discouraged worker effect appears with a delay of a few quarters. The process is asymmetric for females. Workers often permanently leave the market. The availability of <b>old-age</b> <b>benefits</b> increases the probability of outflow from unemployment to inactivity, as do unemployment rate changes.
