For example, in 2010, the New Forest Pony Enthusiasts Club (NFPEC), a {{registered}} riding club whose members compete only on purebred registered New Forest ponies, won the Quadrille competition at the London International Horse Show at Olympia. This was a significant win, as the British Riding Clubs Quadrille is a national competition, with only four teams from the whole of Britain selected to compete at the National Final.|$|E
5|$|Their roles imposed several design {{limitations}} on the vessels. The vessels were designed to operate in coastal areas, which required a shallow draft {{in order for them}} to be able to enter any port on the Baltic seaboard.

Because Stosch envisioned only local deployments for the vessels, they had limited coal stowage, as they could easily replenish their supply.|$|E

5|$|Black's view on {{due process}} drew from his reading of British history; to him, due process meant all persons {{were to be}} tried in {{accordance}} with the Bill of Rights' procedural guarantees and in accordance with constitutionally pursuant laws. Black advocated equal treatment by the government for all persons, regardless of wealth, age, or race. Black's view of due process was restrictive {{in the sense that it}} was premised <b>on</b> <b>equal</b> procedures; it did not extend to substantive due process. This was in accordance with Black's literalist views. Black did not tie procedural due process exclusively to the Bill of Rights, but he did tie it exclusively to the Bill of Rights combined with other explicit provisions of the Constitution.|$|E

5|$|Further {{deliveries}} of {{new aircraft}} from Germany {{continued in the}} early months of 1945 to replace losses, with 39 arriving by the end of March. These included, in addition to regular Messerschmitt Bf 109G deliveries, the final dozen Dornier Do 17 medium bombers, which arrived in January. In March, despite the loss of 15 Bf 109G, ten Morane-Saulnier M.S.406, three Fiat CR.42 and two Fiat G.50, the ZNDH's fighter force included 23 Messerschmitt Bf 109G, three Morane-Saulnier M.S.406, six Fiat G.50 and two Messerschmitt Bf 110G fighters. With the Bf 109G the ZNDH were finally able to face the USAAF and RAF <b>on</b> <b>equal</b> terms, with two squadrons equipped with the type from late 1944. In April, the ZNDH still possessed 176 aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, {{the journal}} Zoologica {{was founded by}} Osborn and Hornaday {{specifically}} as a place for Beebe to publish his research. The first {{issue of the journal}} contained twenty papers, ten of which were written by Beebe, and two more of which were jointly written by him and Lee Saunders Crandall, the zoo's assistant curator of birds. The following year Beebe received a promotion from the Zoological Society, placing him <b>on</b> <b>equal</b> footing with the research scientists at the Museum of Natural History. This promotion explicitly granted him two months off each year, for the purpose of further research expeditions. The first expedition conducted under his new privileges, beginning in February 1908, took him to Trinidad and Venezuela to research birds and insects. During this expedition Beebe captured 40 live birds for the zoo, belonging to 14 different species.|$|E
5|$|In France, the {{unilateral}} British {{decision to}} evacuate through Dunkirk rather than counter-attack to the south, {{and the perceived}} preference of the Royal Navy for evacuating British forces {{at the expense of}} the French, led to some bitter resentment. According to Churchill, French Admiral François Darlan originally ordered that the British forces should receive preference, but on 31 May, he intervened at a meeting in Paris to order that the evacuation should proceed <b>on</b> <b>equal</b> terms and that the British would form the rearguard. In fact, the 35,000 men who finally surrendered after covering the final evacuations were mostly French soldiers of 2nd Light Mechanized Division and the 68th Infantry Division. Their resistance allowed the evacuation effort to be extended to 4 June, on which date another 26,175 Frenchmen were transported to England.|$|E

In the occasion, they meet Ouros, the last of the Xel'Naga who reveals that to confront Amon <b>on</b> <b>equal</b> terms, Kerrigan must inherit Ouros' essence and become a Xel'Naga herself, as Ouros himself is at the last of his strength. Assisted by the Zerg, Terran and Protoss forces, the empowered Kerrigan vanquishes Amon, before disappearing without a trace. Two years later, Kerrigan appears before Raynor in human form and he departs with her to never be heard from again, while the Zerg, the Terran and the Protoss civilizations begin to rebuild in an age of peace and prosperity.|$|E
5|$|Once it {{was clear}} that U.S. {{territory}} was not in danger of being attacked by enemy air units, Saville's expertise in air defense was not needed. In March 1943, he was made director of tactical development at the Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics (AAFSAT) at Orlando, Florida, where he reorganized the Army Air Forces Board by July 2, 1943. Saville's structure put tactical and strategic development <b>on</b> <b>equal</b> footing, and tied together the efforts of the Chief of Air Staff for Operations, Commitments, and Requirements (OC), the Proving Ground Command and the School of Applied Tactics. Saville charged the AAFSAT with developing air defense doctrines and tactics, and with the testing of air defense equipment and methods.|$|E

5|$|The Northumbrian king, Æthelred, {{was assassinated}} in April 796, and {{less than a month}} later his successor, Osbald, was deposed in favour of Eardwulf. Eardwulf had Alhmund killed in 800; Alhmund was the son of King Alhred of Northumbria, who had reigned from 765 to 774. Alhmund's death was {{regarded}} as a martyrdom, and his cult subsequently developed at Derby, in Mercian territory, perhaps implying Mercian involvement in Northumbrian politics at the time. Coenwulf gave hospitality to Eardwulf's enemies, who had been exiled from Northumbria, and consequently Eardwulf invaded Mercia in 801. The invasion was inconclusive, however, and peace was arranged <b>on</b> <b>equal</b> terms. Coenwulf may also have been behind the coup in 806 that led to Eardwulf losing his throne, and he likely continued to support Eardwulf's enemies after Eardwulf returned in 808.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} of 1159 {{and the subsequent}} schism shows the necessity of amending the rules concerning papal elections.

The decree confirmed also that all three orders of the College of Cardinals (bishops, priests and deacons) are equal in the papal elections. Although the practice allowing the participation of cardinal-priests and cardinal-deacons <b>on</b> <b>equal</b> rights with cardinal-bishops had been introduced no later than in the papal election, 1118, the decree In Nomine Domini (1059) conferring the special electoral rights on the cardinal-bishops had never been formally revoked up to that time.|$|E
