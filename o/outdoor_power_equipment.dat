25|$|In December 2010, several groups, {{including}} the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, the American Petroleum Institute, the Association of International Automobile Manufacturers, the National Marine Manufacturers Association, the <b>Outdoor</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Equipment</b> Institute, and the Grocery Manufacturers Association, {{filed suit against}} the EPA in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The plaintiffs argued the EPA {{does not have the}} authority to issue a “partial waiver” that covers some cars and not others. Among other arguments, the groups argued that the higher ethanol blend is not only a problem for cars, but also for fuel pumps and underground tanks not designed for the E15 mixture. It was also argued that the rise in ethanol has contributed to the big jump in corn prices in recent years. In August 2012, the federal appeals court rejected the suit against the EPA. The case was thrown out on a technical reason, as the court ruled the groups did not have legal standing to challenge EPA's decision to issue the waiver for E15. In June 2013 the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal from industry groups opposed to the EPA ruling about E15, and let the 2012 federal appeals court ruling stand.|$|E
25|$|In March 2009 Growth Energy, a {{lobbying}} {{group for the}} ethanol industry, formally requested the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to allow the ethanol content in gasoline to be increased to 15%, from 10%. In October 2010, the EPA granted a waiver to allow up to 15% blends to be sold for cars and trucks with a model year of 2007 or later, representing about 15% of vehicles on the roads. In January 2011 the waiver was expanded to authorize use of E15 to include model year 2001 through 2006 passenger vehicles. The EPA also decided not to grant any waiver for E15 use in any motorcycles, heavy-duty vehicles, or non-road engines because current testing data does not support such a waiver. According to the Renewable Fuels Association the E15 waivers now cover 62% of vehicles {{on the road in}} the country. In December 2010 several groups, including the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, the American Petroleum Institute, the Association of International Automobile Manufacturers, the National Marine Manufacturers Association, the <b>Outdoor</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Equipment</b> Institute, and the Grocery Manufacturers Association, filed suit against the EPA in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

40|$|Power {{transformers}} play a {{vital role}} across the electrical grid network. This element of the grid network is commonly located in the outdoor environment. Unfortunately, there is no well defined environmental condition {{to be used as a}} design guide line. Therefore, this leads to a lack of defining the solar load effect, the worst maximum and minimum ambient temperature, the climbing ambient temperature variation per hour, the Pico and micro climate effects, the maximum altitude, the worst maximum and minimum relative humidity and the dew point temperature. In the present study, the thermal design of a single phase transformer is examined numerically. The environmental condition was selected based on 3 different cities in the northern hemisphere. These cities are Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Colorado spring, USA and Ottawa, Canada. These cities represent the different environmental conditions which the power transformer can be subjected to it. The current investigation will determine the temperature variation across the windings, insulators and the core. These temperature variations can be eventually used to determine the potential thermal stresses which can lead to the major failure of the transformer. Finally, the authors will propose an environmental condition, which can be used in this type of product, which, in turns, can be used as a starting point for the thermal community to develop a special standard for <b>outdoor</b> high <b>powered</b> <b>equipment...</b>|$|R
