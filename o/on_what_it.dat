The father only has minor {{injuries}} but the police seem to believe {{he had something to}} do with the incident. Maddy tries to find out what is happening from the father, who is not talking to the police. She seems to have some connection with him but can't seem to put her finger <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is.|$|E
5|$|The {{obvious choice}} for a supreme {{commander}} in the Pacific was General Douglas MacArthur. He had been ordered to leave the Philippines for Australia to take command of a reconstituted ABDA area on 22 February 1942, and had therefore been promised the command even before there were discussions <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> should be. MacArthur had solid support from the President, the Army and the American people, but not the Navy. The Commander in Chief, United States Fleet, Admiral Ernest King, saw the Pacific lines of communication primarily as a naval responsibility and would not yield command to an Army officer and proposed a division placing all of the Solomons within the Australian area, but excluding the New Hebrides, New Caledonia, and New Zealand. While the Army planners, led by Brigadier General Dwight Eisenhower, were willing to compromise on a divided command, they objected to placing Australia and New Zealand in separate theatres. The Joint Chiefs of Staff discussed the matter between 9 and 16 March, the result {{of which was a}} decision to adopt the Navy's plan, with only minor amendments.|$|E
5|$|When we came {{to record}} it in the studio we {{struggled}} because there was something just not quite right about it and I wasn't happy about where we'd left it and where we were happy to leave it and we couldn't put our finger <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was {{and so it was}} a really nice day one day, me and Chris were just trying, I was actually just trying to record bass at the time and me and Chris were just sitting down trying to brainstorm it and work out what was wrong and so I started trying to just do a few different bass lines and stuff. Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E

25|$|They {{are usually}} {{caused by a}} {{bacterial}} infection. Often {{many different types of}} bacteria are involved in a single infection. In the United States and many other areas of the world the most common bacteria present is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Rarely, parasites can cause abscesses; this is more common in the developing world. Diagnosis of a skin abscess is usually made based <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> looks like, and is confirmed by cutting it open. Ultrasound imaging may be useful in cases in which the diagnosis is not clear. In abscesses around the anus, computer tomography (CT) may be important to look for deeper infection.|$|E

25|$|The Soviet Union, {{after long}} {{peering through the}} keyhole of a closed door <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> {{considered}} a Western sphere of influence, now found itself invited over the threshold {{as a friend of}} the Arabs. Shortly after it reopened, the canal was traversed by the first Soviet warships since World War I. The Soviets' burgeoning influence in the Middle East, although it was not to last, included acquiring Mediterranean bases, introducing multipurpose projects, supporting the budding Palestinian liberation movement and penetrating the Arab countries. Nasser claimed to be the defender of the Palestinian cause, but his anti-Israel warlike rhetoric damaged the Palestinians since it convinced a lot of the Israelis to oppose reconciliation with the Palestinians.|$|E
25|$|Mexico drilled {{its first}} shale gas well in 2011, in the Burgos Basin of {{northern}} Mexico, in {{the equivalent of}} the Eagle Ford Formation of the US. But as of February 2013, there have been only six productive shale gas and tight oil wells drilled in Mexico (a seventh was abandoned as non-productive), all producing from Eagle Ford equivalent. The national oil company Pemex has limited investment capital, and focuses its effort <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> sees as higher-return conventional oil and gas projects, rather than gas shales or tight oil. The US Energy Information Administration estimates Mexico's recoverable reserves of shale gas to be 681 trillion cubic feet, the fourth largest shale gas reserves in the world.|$|E
25|$|Trade {{unions and}} {{collective}} bargaining were outlawed from {{no later than}} {{the middle of the}} 14th century when the Ordinance of Labourers was enacted in the Kingdom of England. As collective bargaining and early worker unions grew with the onset of the Industrial Revolution, the government began to clamp down <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> saw as the danger of popular unrest {{at the time of the}} Napoleonic Wars. In 1799, the Combination Act was passed, which banned trade unions and collective bargaining by British workers. Although the unions were subject to often severe repression until 1824, they were already widespread in cities such as London. Workplace militancy had also manifested itself as Luddism and had been prominent in struggles such as the 1820 Rising in Scotland, in which 60,000 workers went on a general strike, which was soon crushed. Sympathy for the plight of the workers brought repeal of the acts in 1824, although the Combination Act 1825 severely restricted their activity.|$|E
