5|$|During late July 2009, a moonlet was {{discovered}} in the B Ring, 480km from the <b>outer</b> <b>edge</b> of the ring, by the shadow it cast. It {{is estimated to be}} 300m in diameter. Unlike the A Ring moonlets (see below), it does not induce a 'propeller' feature, probably due to the density of the B Ring.|$|E
50|$|The 24 <b>outer</b> <b>edges</b> {{cannot be}} flipped, since the {{interior}} shape of those pieces is asymmetrical. Corresponding <b>outer</b> <b>edges</b> are distinguishable, since {{the pieces are}} mirror images of each other. Any permutation of the <b>outer</b> <b>edges</b> is possible, including odd permutations, giving 24! arrangements. The 12 central edges can be flipped. Eleven can be flipped and arranged independently, giving 12!/2 × 211 or 12! × 210 possibilities (an odd permutation of the corners implies an odd permutation of the central edges, and vice versa, thus the division by 2). There are 24! × 12! × 210 possibilities for the inner and <b>outer</b> <b>edges</b> together.|$|R
50|$|A dendroidal set is a {{contravariant}} functor from Ω to sets, where Ω is {{the tree}} category consisting of finite rooted trees considered as operads, whose morphisms are operad morphisms.

5|$|The {{orbit of}} Thebe lies near the <b>outer</b> <b>edge</b> of the Thebe gossamer ring, which is {{composed}} of the dust ejected from the satellite.

However, many publications do not mention the Arago ring at all.|$|E
5|$|A careful {{examination}} of Facsimile No. 2 {{shows that there}} is a difference between most of the hieroglyphic signs and the signs on the right third of the figure on the <b>outer</b> <b>edge</b> as well as the outer portions of the sections numbered 12–15. These signs are hieratic, not hieroglyphic, and are inverted, or upside down, to the rest of the text. In fact, they are a fairly accurate copy of lines 2, 3, and 4 of the Joseph Smith Papyrus XI, which contains a portion of the Book of Breathings. Especially clear is the word snsn, in section 14, and part of the name of the mother of the owner of the papyrus, (tay-)uby.t, repeated twice on the <b>outer</b> <b>edge.</b> An ink drawing of the hypocephalus in the Church Historian's office shows these same areas as being blank. It is likely that these portions were destroyed on the original hypocephalus and someone (the engraver, one of Joseph Smith's associates, or Joseph himself) copied the lines from the Book of Breathings papyrus for aesthetic purposes.|$|E
5|$|Amalthea is in a {{close orbit}} around Jupiter and is within the <b>outer</b> <b>edge</b> of the Amalthea Gossamer Ring, which is formed from dust ejected from its surface. From its surface, Jupiter would appear 46.5 degrees in diameter. Amalthea is {{the largest of the}} inner {{satellites}} of Jupiter. Irregularly shaped and reddish in color, it is thought to consist of porous water ice with unknown amounts of other materials. Its surface features include large craters and ridges.|$|E

5|$|The cloudy <b>outer</b> <b>edge</b> {{of the eye}} {{is called}} the “eyewall”. The eyewall {{typically}} expands outward with height, resembling an arena football stadium; this phenomenon is {{sometimes referred to as}} the stadium effect. The eyewall is where the greatest wind speeds are found, air rises most rapidly, clouds reach to their highest altitude, and precipitation is the heaviest. The heaviest wind damage occurs where a tropical cyclone's eyewall passes over land.|$|E
5|$|The {{second largest}} of the inner {{satellites}} of Jupiter, Thebe orbits within the <b>outer</b> <b>edge</b> of the Thebe gossamer ring that is formed from dust ejected from its surface. It is irregularly shaped and reddish in colour, and is thought like Amalthea to consist of porous water ice with unknown amounts of other materials. Its surface features include large craters and high mountains—some of them are comparable {{to the size of}} the moon itself.|$|E
5|$|The ε ring {{is known}} to have {{interior}} and exterior shepherd moons—Cordelia and Ophelia, respectively. The inner edge of the ring is in 24:25 resonance with Cordelia, and the <b>outer</b> <b>edge</b> is in 14:13 resonance with Ophelia. The masses of the moons need to be at least three times the mass of the ring to confine it effectively. The mass of the ε ring is estimated to be about 1016kg.|$|E
25|$|By radiographic, i.e. X-Ray, methods, after arteries have {{developed}} advanced calcified atherosclerotic plaque, IMT {{can also be}} semi-estimated by {{the distance between the}} <b>outer</b> <b>edges</b> of calcification (actually this leaves out most of the media) and the <b>outer</b> <b>edges</b> of an angiographic dye column within the artery lumen.

5|$|Discovery {{of active}} {{volcanic}} {{activity on the}} moon Io was probably the greatest surprise. It {{was the first time}} active volcanoes had been seen on another body in the Solar System. It appears that activity on Io affects the entire Jovian system. Io appears to be the primary source of matter that pervades the Jovian magnetosphere – the region of space that surrounds the planet influenced by the planet's strong magnetic field. Sulfur, oxygen, and sodium, apparently erupted by Io's volcanoes and sputtered off the surface by impact of high-energy particles, were detected at the <b>outer</b> <b>edge</b> of the magnetosphere of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Even on a {{habitable}} {{planet with}} enough radioisotopes to heat its interior, various prebiotic molecules are required {{in order to}} produce life; therefore, the distribution of these molecules in the galaxy is important in determining the galactic habitable zone. A 2008 study by Samantha Blair and colleagues attempted to determine the <b>outer</b> <b>edge</b> of the galactic habitable zone by means of analyzing formaldehyde and carbon monoxide emissions from various giant molecular clouds scattered throughout the Milky Way; however, the data is neither conclusive nor complete.|$|E
5|$|His first {{project for}} Webb and Knapp was an {{apartment}} building with funding from the Housing Act of 1949. Pei's design {{was based on a}} circular tower with concentric rings. The areas closest to the supporting pillar handled utilities and circulation; the apartments themselves were located toward the <b>outer</b> <b>edge.</b> Zeckendorf loved the design and even showed it off to Le Corbusier when they met. The cost of such an unusual design was too high, however, and the building never moved beyond the model stage.|$|E

5|$|Skirting the <b>outer</b> <b>edge</b> of the {{asteroid}} belt is the Cybele group, orbiting between 3.3 and 3.5AU. These have a 7:4 orbital resonance with Jupiter. The Hilda family orbit between 3.5 and 4.2AU, and have relatively circular orbits and a stable 3:2 orbital resonance with Jupiter. There are few asteroids beyond 4.2AU, until Jupiter's orbit. Here the two families of Trojan asteroids can be found, which, at least for objects larger than 1km, are approximately as numerous as {{the asteroid}}s {{of the asteroid}} belt.|$|E
5|$|The <b>outer</b> <b>edge</b> of the vulcanoid zone is {{approximately}} 0.21AU from the Sun. More distant objects are unstable {{due to the}} gravitational influence of Mercury and would be perturbed into Mercury-crossing orbits on timescales {{of the order of}} 100 million years. The inner edge is not sharply defined: objects closer than 0.06AU are highly susceptible to Poynting–Robertson drag and the Yarkovsky effect, and even out to 0.09AU vulcanoids would have temperatures of 1,000K or more, which is hot enough for evaporation of rocks to be the limiting factor in their lifetime.|$|E
5|$|The {{volume of}} the vulcanoid zone is very small {{compared}} to that of the asteroid belt. Collisions between objects in the vulcanoid zone would be frequent and highly energetic, tending to lead to the destruction of the objects. The most favourable location for vulcanoids is probably in circular orbits near the <b>outer</b> <b>edge</b> of the vulcanoid zone. Vulcanoids are unlikely to have inclinations of more than about 10° to the ecliptic. Mercury trojans, asteroids trapped in Mercury's Lagrange points, are also possible.|$|E
