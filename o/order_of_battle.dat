5|$|In 1948, Australia's {{part-time}} military force, {{under the}} guise of the Citizens Military Force (CMF), was re-raised.

5|$|In 1948, when Australia's {{part-time}} {{military force}} was re-raised as the Citizens Military Force (CMF), the 10th Battalion {{returned to the}} <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>battle,</b> readopting the designation of The Adelaide Rifles. Throughout the 1950s, as part of Central Command, the battalion provided training for national servicemen until 1960, when a widespread re-organisation of the CMF saw the creation of six state-based multi-battalion regiments as the smaller, regional regiments of the past were consolidated. As a result, the 10th Battalion was subsumed into the pentropic 1st Battalion, Royal South Australia Regiment, providing two companies: 'D' (The Adelaide Company) and 'E' (The Port Adelaide Company). In 1961, the battalion, although technically off the Army's <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>battle,</b> was entrusted with the 12 battle honours that had been earned by the 2/10th Battalion during World War II.|$|E
5|$|The 6th Division's {{structure}} changed considerably during World War II, with units being detached or {{attached to}} meet operational needs. This was particularly so during early 1942 and late 1943. Below is a divisional <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>battle</b> that {{is indicative of}} its generic make up. In addition to those listed, during 1942–1943, the 14th, 21st, 25th and 30th Brigades were also attached, albeit temporarily for varying periods.|$|E
5|$|The battalions of the {{regiment}} {{are capable of}} providing seven of the ten regular battlegroups that the Australian Army has available for deployment. The current <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>battle</b> sees 5 and 7 RAR {{as part of the}} 1st Brigade based in Darwin and Adelaide; 1, 2, and 3 RAR as part of the 3rd Brigade in Townsville; and 6 and 8/9 RAR as part of the 7th Brigade in Brisbane.|$|E

5|$|This <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>battle</b> {{was almost}} always followed, {{the battle of the}} Great Plains and the battle of Zama being among the few notable exceptions.

5|$|Through 1941 and 1942, 1st SAS formed part of Clarke's overall {{strategy}} to deceive the Axis about {{the strength of}} Allied forces in the region. In early 1942, this ad hoc situation was formalised as Operation Cascade; an entire fictional <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>battle</b> featuring numerous units.|$|E
5|$|During 18 August 1940, Luftwaffe units flew a {{total of}} 970 sorties over Britain: some 495 by medium bombers, 460 by fighters and 15 by {{reconnaissance}} units. Of this total, about 170 of the bomber sorties were flown {{on the night of}} 17/18 August; the remainder were flown during the daylight hours on 18 August. Less than half of the available (or serviceable) aircraft on the Luftflotte 2 and Luftflotte 3 <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>battle</b> were involved in the action that day, so {{it was clear that the}} Luftwaffe was not greatly extended in providing forces for the offensive. Luftflotte 5 did not take any part in the fighting, although its reconnaissance aircraft were active over England and Scotland.|$|E

5|$|Faulty {{intelligence}} was the component that was mostly {{responsible for the}} failure of Adlertag. While the gap between the British and Germans was not yet wide in this regard, the British were starting to gain a decisive lead in intelligence. The breaking of the Enigma machine and poor Luftwaffe signals discipline allowed the British easy access to German communications traffic. The impact of Ultra on the Battle of Britain is a matter of dispute, with Official Histories claiming there was no direct impact. Whatever the truth, Ultra, and the Y service in particular, gave the British an increasingly accurate picture of German <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>battle</b> deployments.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war, the 2nd Battalion was re-raised as part of the Citizens Military Force in 1948. In 1960, it {{was reduced}} to a company-level {{formation}} but was re-formed as a battalion of the Royal New South Wales Regiment in 1965. It remained on the Australian <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>battle</b> until 1987 when it was amalgamated with the 17th Battalion, to form the 2nd/17th Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment, a unit which remains part of the Australian Army Reserve today.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1941, when David Stirling was {{pitching}} his idea for a dedicated airborne commando unit (which later evolved into the Special Air Service) he obtained Clarke's support partly by promising to use the SAS name. From late 1942, Clarke used the 1st SAS in his major <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>battle</b> deception (codenamed Operation Cascade). The brigade formed part of the fictional 4th Airborne Division; between then {{and the end of}} the war it was used to mislead Axis commanders about the strength of Allied forces in North Africa, and as part of several specific tactical deceptions.|$|E

Some 22 Bf 109s of I./JG 3 took off, along with four from Stab./JG 3, 15 from III./JG 3 and 19 Fw 190s from IV./JG 3. KG 51 contributed some 21 of their 30 Messerschmitt Me 262 jets to the action.

5|$|Most of the {{division}} returned to New York in September 1945, and from there went to Camp Bowie, Texas. On 7 December 1945, {{the division}} was deactivated from the active duty force and its members reassigned to other Army units. The following year, on 10 September 1946, the 45th Infantry Division was reconstituted as a National Guard unit. Instead of comprising units from several states, the post-war 45th was an all-Oklahoma organization. During this time the division was also reorganized and {{as a part of}} this process the 157th Infantry was removed from the division's <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>battle</b> and replaced with the 279th Infantry Regiment.|$|E
5|$|No {{additional}} SPUs {{were set}} up in 1992, regardless of discrepancies between the November 1991 reorganisation scheme and the actual <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>battle</b> of the special police.

Following a reorganisation of the force carried out in 2001, the regionally based units were amalgamated into four units—Zagreb, Split, Rijeka and Osijek. At the same time, the special police was reduced to 300 personnel.|$|E
