5|$|During the Paris Peace Conference, the Armenian {{delegation}} {{presented an}} assessment of $3.7 billion (about $ billion today) worth of material losses owned solely by the Armenian church. During the conference in February 1920, the Armenian community presented an additional demand for the restitution <b>of</b> <b>property</b> <b>and</b> assets seized by the Ottoman government. The joint declaration, which was submitted to the Supreme Council by the Armenian delegation and prepared by the religious leaders of the Armenian community, claimed that the Ottoman government had destroyed 2,000 churches and 200 monasteries and had provided the legal system for giving these properties to other parties. The declaration also provided a financial assessment of the total losses of personal property and assets of both Turkish and Russian Armenia with 14,598,510,000 and 4,532,472,000 francs respectively; totaling to an estimated $ billion today. Furthermore, the Armenian community asked for the restitution of church owned property and reimbursement of its generated income. The Ottoman government never responded to this declaration and so restitution did not occur.|$|E
5|$|Federal {{prosecutors}} {{launched an}} investigation {{to determine if}} he had acted out of hatred for Obama. Writings by Ortega-Hernandez and testimonies from {{those who knew him}} revealed that he believed that he was Jesus, and that President Obama was the Antichrist and the devil. Ortega-Hernandez was not found to be affiliated with any extremist groups. In September 2013, Ortega-Hernandez pled guilty to two of the nineteen charges against him: one count of destruction <b>of</b> <b>property</b> <b>and</b> one count of discharging a firearm during a crime of violence. As part of his plea bargain, the remaining charges were dropped, including the charge of attempting to assassinate the President, which carried a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. On March 31, 2014, Ortega-Hernandez was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment by Judge Rosemary M. Collyer. His lawyers had asked for a 10-year sentence, stating Ortega-Hernandez was suffering from depression and stress. Prosecutors had asked for the maximum sentence of 27Â½ years. He is serving his sentence at United States Penitentiary, Beaumont, with a release date of October 24, 2033.|$|E

5|$|Frederick grew {{up during}} a tumultuous {{political}} period as {{the concept of}} liberalism in Germany, which evolved during the 1840s, was gaining widespread and enthusiastic support. The liberals sought a unified Germany and were constitutional monarchists who desired a constitution to ensure equal protection under the law, the protection <b>of</b> <b>property,</b> <b>and</b> the safeguarding of basic civil rights. Overall, the liberals desired a government ruled by popular representation. When Frederick was 17, these emergent nationalistic and liberal sentiments sparked a series of political uprisings across the German states and elsewhere in Europe. In Germany, their goal was to protect freedoms, such as the freedom of assembly and freedom of the press, {{and to create a}} German parliament and constitution. Although the uprisings ultimately brought about no lasting changes, liberal sentiments remained an influential force in German politics throughout Frederick's life.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch East India Company (VOC) {{arrived in}} {{southern}} Formosa in 1624 and, after building their stronghold of Fort Zeelandia {{on the peninsula}} of Tayouan, began to sound out local villages as {{to the possibility of}} forming alliances. Although initially the intention was to run the colony solely as an entrepÃ´t (a trading port), the Dutch later decided that they needed control over the hinterland to provide some security. Additionally, a large percentage of supplies for the Dutch colonists had to be shipped from Batavia at great expense and irregular intervals, and the government of the fledgling colony was keen to source foodstuffs and other supplies locally. The Company decided to ally with the closest village, the relatively small Sinkan, who were able to supply them firewood, venison and fish. However, relations with the other villages were not so friendly. The aboriginal settlements of the area were involved in more or less constant low-level warfare with each other (head-hunting raids and looting <b>of</b> <b>property),</b> <b>and</b> an alliance with Sinkan put the Dutch at odds with the foes of that village. In 1625 the Dutch bought a piece of land from the Sinkaners for the sum of fifteen cangans (a kind of cloth), where they then built the town of Sakam for Dutch and Chinese merchants.|$|E
5|$|The Smuts {{family were}} {{traditional}} Afrikaner farmers. As such, questions <b>of</b> <b>property</b> <b>and</b> family affairs were extensively governed by custom. Custom dictated {{that it was}} upon the first son that family expectations fell; the family would strive, so far as their means allowed, to provide him with the best possible education {{with the goal of}} paving the way for his entry into one of the professions. As for the others, they would be put to work on the farm, {{while at the same time}} receiving a rudimentary home education. As the second son this was to be Jan's role. While he remained at the farm, his elder brother, Michiel, was sent to begin his schooling in Riebeek West, destined, like his uncle Boudewyn, for a future as a predikant in the Dutch Reformed Church.|$|E

This paper provides a systematic analysis <b>of</b> the <b>property</b> models with special emphasis on relations between separation task, equilibrium <b>properties</b> <b>and</b> energy consumption. The presented analysis helps to establish the role <b>of</b> <b>properties</b> <b>and</b> the <b>property</b> model in design of separation by distillation. Based on the roles <b>of</b> <b>properties</b> <b>and</b> <b>property</b> models, a general guideline that serves as a useful roadmap for design and analysis of various types of separation with distillation is proposed. Finally, the roles and the guidelines are highlighted through simple illustrative examples. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
