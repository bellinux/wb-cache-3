25|$|Velázquez {{was also}} a {{faithful}} supporter of the technocrat current within the PRI, which sought to dismantle the nationalist economic policies of the Mexican Revolution in order to open México to foreign investment.

During those years the minimum wage in real terms fell by nearly 70 percent.

25|$|The largest {{centers of}} the urban area {{maintain}} global city status and as a whole the metropolitan region is host to 13 consulates from Asian, European, North American, Oceanian, and South American nations.

Since the implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>Free</b> Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994, San Diego–Tijuana has become a dominant commercial center in the United States and Mexico. The economic success of globalization has allowed San Diego–Tijuana to grow to the third richest region in the former Californias region, with a GDP of $136.3 billion in 2002. Renowned for natural beauty, tourism is a leading industry {{in the region and}} its coastal environs have been paramount factors in the growth of action sports-lifestyle companies.
