40|$|An {{important}} {{recent development}} in U. S. capital markets is the tremendous {{growth in the}} secondary market trading of syndicated loans. This paper uses a unique trading data set for syndicated loans over the period 1997 to 2003 to empirically investigate two major issues. First, we present a statistical overview of the recent growth in the secondary market trading of syndicated loans. Second, we examine the determinants <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>syndicated</b> <b>loans</b> {{are most likely to}} be traded in the secondary market using binomial logistic regression models. We find that syndicated loans that are larger, have longer maturities, are underwritten by larger syndicates, and are used for debt repayment, takeovers, and leveraged buyouts are more likely to be traded. Lender reputation plays an important role as well, with loans originated by very active lenders more likely to be traded. We also find that syndicated loans made to borrowers with only senior debt ratings are more likely to be traded in the secondary market than loans made to borrowers with both a debt rating and equity that trades in a stock exchange. This result most likely reflects the growing demand of institutional investors for the higher yields of levered and highly levered syndicated loans made to riskier opaque borrowers with less available market information...|$|E

As a result, during the crisis the volume of <b>syndicated</b> <b>loans</b> grew steadily, in contrast to other countries.

40|$|I {{examine whether}} cross-listing of non-U. S. firms on the U.

Cross-listing also leads to foreign lenders holding a larger portion in <b>syndicated</b> <b>loans.</b> Good legal system, strong creditor protection, low corruption and high level of economic development weaken the effect of cross-listing on <b>loan</b> <b>syndicate</b> structure. Cross-listing significantly affects {{the probability of a}} loan with a foreign lead lender, while domestic listing has no such effect.

40|$|This work {{undertakes}} {{the first}} comprehensive theoretical assessment of <b>syndicated</b> <b>loans.</b> It is shown that syndicated and bilateral (single lender) loans should be good substitutes in meeting a borrower's financing requirements, but that <b>syndicated</b> <b>loans</b> are more complex and impose additional risks to the parties {{in the way they}} are arranged. The existing explantions of loan syndication - that they are hybrids of private bank loans and public debt instruments, that syndication is a portfolio management tool, and that <b>loans</b> are <b>syndicated</b> where they are too large to be provided bilaterally - are unable to substantially explain both the nature of <b>syndicated</b> <b>loans</b> and practice in the loan markets. A rigorous new explanation is developed, which shows that syndication reduces the rate of lending costs, so that the return to the loan originator is greater, and the borrower's cost of financing is lower, where a <b>loan</b> is <b>syndicated</b> rather than provided bilaterally. This explanation is shown to hold in competitive loan markets and to be consistent with the observation that <b>syndicated</b> <b>loans</b> are generally larger than other loans. Incidental to this new explanation, new expressions of the return to a bank from providing a loan on a bilateral basis and from originating a <b>syndicated</b> <b>loan</b> are also developed. New algorithms are also developed for determining the distribution of the commitments from syndicate participants and thus the originator's final hold, the amount it must lend itself, where the loan is underwritten. This provides, for the first time, a rigorous basis for assessing the expected return, and the risk, for the originator of a given <b>syndicated</b> <b>loan.</b> Finally, empirical testing finds that a bank's observed lending history is significant to its decision to participate in a new <b>syndicated</b> <b>loan</b> but that predictions <b>of</b> participation, <b>which</b> are fundamental inputs into the final hold algorithms, based on this information have relatively little power. It follows that there is competitive advantage to loan originators that have access to other, private information on potential participants' lending intentions...|$|R
