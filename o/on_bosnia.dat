5|$|As the Kingdom of Bosnia {{continued}} to expand, Tvrtko's attention {{shifted to the}} Adriatic coast. He gained control of the entire Pomorje and the major maritime cities of the area, established new settlements and started building a navy, but never succeeded in subjugating the lords of the independent Serbian territories. The death of King Louis and the accession of Queen Mary in 1382 allowed Tvrtko {{to take advantage of}} the ensuing succession crisis in Hungary and Croatia. After bitter fighting, from 1385 to 1390, Tvrtko succeeded in conquering large parts of Slavonia, Dalmatia, and Croatia proper. Following the Battle of Kosovo in 1389, his tenuous claim to Serbia became a mere fiction, as the Serbian rulers he sought to subdue became vassals of the victorious Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman Turks also launched their first attacks <b>on</b> <b>Bosnia</b> during Tvrtko's reign, but his army was able to repel them. Tvrtko's sudden death in 1391 prevented him from solidifying the Kotromanić hold on Croatian lands.|$|E
5|$|The {{capabilities}} of the HV increased dramatically {{in the first few}} months of 1992 because it acquired large stockpiles of JNA's weapons in the Battle of the Barracks. After the JNA disengaged in Croatia, its personnel prepared to set up a new Bosnian Serb army, later renamed the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS). The move followed the Bosnian Serb declaration of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 9 January 1992, ahead of the 29 February1 March 1992 referendum <b>on</b> <b>Bosnia</b> and Herzegovina's independence. The referendum would later be cited as a pretext for the Bosnian War, which commenced in early April 1992, when the VRS's artillery began shelling Sarajevo. The JNA and the VRS in Bosnia and Herzegovina were confronted by the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), reporting to the Bosniak-dominated central government and the Bosnian Croat leadership respectively. The HV sometimes deployed to Bosnia and Herzegovina to support the HVO.|$|E
5|$|The reforms became firmly {{rooted in}} Bosnia during the 1860s, when the Ottoman {{governor}} (vali) {{of the province}} was Topal Sherif Osman Pasha, {{though most of the}} changes proceeded at a slow pace. According to the recently issued Ottoman constitutional law, each vilayet (first-order administrative division) was to have an official printing house and an official gazette. The Constitutional Law for the Vilayet of Bosnia, published in 1865, promoted the province from the rank of eyalet to that of vilayet, and Article9 of this law stipulated that there be an official printing house in its capital. Osman Pasha also had other motivations to establish a printing house. At that time, the press in the Principality of Serbia and in South Slavic parts of the Austrian Empire sharply criticised the Ottoman regime in Bosnia. Textbooks imported from Serbia for Serb elementary schools in Bosnia also disseminated nationalist sentiment, which Osman Pasha saw as anti-Ottoman. In his view, the national movement of the Serbs in Bosnia presented a danger for Ottoman state interests. To protect their hold <b>on</b> <b>Bosnia,</b> the Ottomans sought to promote the idea of a unitary Bosnian nation, thus counteracting the particular national identities and political aspirations of Bosnia's Serbs, Croats, and Muslims.|$|E

Croatian President Franjo Tuđman, in a letter to United States senator Robert Dole, later presented the agreement as part of a Conference <b>on</b> <b>Bosnia</b> and Herzegovina sponsored by the European Community.

25|$|Pakistan's {{intelligence}} agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), {{became involved}} in supporting Muslims around the world. Despite the UN arms embargo <b>on</b> <b>Bosnia,</b> ISI's Director-General Javed Nasir later confessed that the ISI airlifted anti-tank weapons and missiles to the Bosnian mujahideen which turned the tide in favour of Bosnian Muslims and forced the Serbs to lift the siege. Under Nasir's leadership the ISI was also involved in supporting Chinese Muslims in Xinjiang Province, rebel Muslim groups in the Philippines, and some religious groups in Central Asia.|$|E

25|$|Jović's memoirs {{show that}} Milošević had on 5 December 1991 ordered for the JNA troops in BiH to be reorganized, its non-Bosnian {{personnel}} to be withdrawn, in case recognition {{would result in}} the perceival of JNA as a foreign force; left would be Bosnian Serbs to form the nucleus of a Bosnian Serb army. Accordingly, {{by the end of the}} month the JNA in BiH had only 10–15% from outside the republic.

Jović's memoirs suggest that Milošević planned for an attack <b>on</b> <b>Bosnia</b> well in advance.|$|E
25|$|By now Thomas {{suspected}} that Mehmed intended on conquering his kingdom too. He therefore started taking {{more interest in}} Christian coalition against the Turks and cooperating more closely with his father-in-law. The lack of a firmer action against the Ottomans was blamed on Bosnian Christians, whom he described as being more inclined towards the Muslims than towards other Christians. The heavy Ottoman defeat by Hungarians at the Battle of Belgrade in July 1456 did nothing to alleviate Thomas' situation, as Mehmed started exerting an even greater pressure <b>on</b> <b>Bosnia.</b> In addition to financial extortion, Thomas was now forbidden to export silver, which Mehmed claimed for himself. This severe crippling of Bosnian economy suffocated the kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, in Bosnia, Gradaščević {{decided to}} carry on his {{campaign}} in Herzegovina despite the unfavorable climate. The captain of Livno, Ibrahim-beg Fidrus, was ordered to launch a final attack against the local captains and to thus end all domestic opposition to the autonomy movement. To achieve this, Fidrus first attacked Ljubuški and the local captain Sulejman-beg. In a significant victory, Fidrus defeated Sulejman-beg and secured the whole of Herzegovina except Stolac in the process. Unfortunately, the segment of the army that laid siege to Stolac itself met with failure in early March of the next year. Receiving information that the Bosnian ranks were depleted due to the winter, the captain of Stolac Ali-paša Rizvanbegović broke the siege, counterattacking the rebels and dispersing their forces. A force had already been sent towards Stolac from Sarajevo, {{under the command of}} Mujaga Zlatar, but was ordered back by Gradaščević on March 16 after he received news of a major offensive <b>on</b> <b>Bosnia</b> being planned by the Grand Vizier.|$|E

A Home Guard document described him as the most intelligent and dangerous rebel leader, who planned and carried out attacks in a highly systematic manner. The headquarters was especially concerned about Stojanović's treatment of captured Home Guards: he would give them a communist propaganda speech, offer them food and cigarettes, dress their wounds, and let them go home. According to the headquarters, this treatment rendered these particular Home Guards useless in future operations against the Partisans. According to Drago Karasijević, the courage and fighting spirit of the Kozara Partisans became famous in Bosanska Krajina, {{in other parts of}} Bosnia and in the areas of the NDH bordering <b>on</b> <b>Bosnia.</b> In the villages of Kozara, people sang about Stojanović: ...|$|E
