Moreover, the Piojillo river overflowed its banks, killing many people and resulting in considerable damage. Elsewhere, destruction was reported in San Jose del Cabo, Cabo San Lucas, San Lucas, and Puntas Arena; Pichilinague also received moderate damage.

25|$|Viking {{settlements}} in Ireland and Great Britain {{are thought to}} have been primarily male enterprises, however some graves show nearly equal male/female distribution. Disagreement is partly due to method of classification; previous archaeology often guessed biological sex from burial artifacts, whereas modern archaeology may use osteology to find biological sex, and isotope analysis to find origin (DNA sampling is usually not possible). The males buried during that period in a cemetery on the Isle of Man had mainly names of Norse origin, while the females there had names of indigenous origin. Irish and British women are mentioned in old texts on the founding of Iceland, indicating that the Viking explorers were accompanied there by women from the British Isles who either came along voluntarily or were taken along by force. Genetic studies of the population in the Western Isles and Isle of Skye also show that Viking settlements were established mainly by male Vikings who mated with women from the local populations <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>places.</b>|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} the Dutch arrived in the early 17th century, major Chinese {{settlements}} existed along the north coast of Java. Most were traders and merchants, but they also practiced agriculture in inland areas. The Dutch contracted many of these immigrants as skilled artisans {{in the construction of}} Batavia (Jakarta) on the northwestern coast of Java. A recently created harbor was selected as the new headquarters of the Dutch East India Company ( [...] , VOC) in 1609 by Jan Pieterszoon Coen. It grew into a major hub for trade with China and India. Batavia became home to the largest Chinese community in the archipelago and remains so in the 21st century. Coen and other early Governors-General promoted the entry of Chinese immigrants to new settlements [...] "for the benefit <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>places</b> and for the purpose of gathering spices like cloves, nutmeg, and mace". The port's Chinese population of 300–400 in 1619 had grown to at least 10,000 by 1740. The Dutch, however, introduced a racial classification system that separated residents of Chinese ancestry from those of other ancestry. The Dutch colonial rule saw the rise of anti-Chinese policies.|$|E

5|$|Four {{different}} types of male flowers exist. On {{the basis of these}} flower types, the genus has often been split into four genera—a more narrowly defined Attalea, Orbignya, Maximiliana and Scheelea. The species sometimes referred to Orbignya have coiled anthers, while the other groups have straight ones. The petals <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>placed</b> in Maximiliana are much shorter than the stamens, while <b>those</b> <b>placed</b> in Scheelea and a more narrowly defined Attalea have petals that are longer than the stamens. Five species do not fit easily into any of these groups; this fact has been used as an argument in favour of considering this group a single genus.|$|R

2500|$|After {{his arrival}} in London, being demanded of sundry his friends what thing he had brought them home of that country, [...] had nothing left to present them withal but a piece of this black stone. And it fortuned a gentlewoman, one of the adventurer’s wives, to have a piece thereof, which by chance she threw and burned in the fire so long that at the length being taken forth and {{quenched}} in a little vinegar it glistered with a bright marquesset of gold. Whereupon the matter being called in some question, it was brought to certain goldfinders in London to make assay thereof, who indeed found it to hold gold, and that very richly for the quantity. Afterwards the same goldfinders promised great matters thereof {{if there were any}} store to be found, and offered themselves to adventure for the searching of those parts from whence the same was brought. [...] Some that had great hope of the matter sought secretly to have a lease at her Majesty’s hands <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>places,</b> whereby to enjoy the mass of so great a public profit unto their own private gains. In conclusion, the hope of the same gold ore to be found kindled a greater opinion in the hearts of many to advance the voyage again.|$|E
