40|$|Ozone depletions in {{the polar}} {{stratosphere}} during the energetic solar proton event on 4 August 1972 were observed by the backscattered ultraviolet (BUV) experiments on the Nimbus 4 satellite. The observed <b>ozone</b> <b>contents,</b> the <b>ozone</b> depressions and their temporal variations above the 4 mb level exhibited distinct asymmetries between {{the northern and}} southern hemispheres. Since the ozone destroying solar particles precipitate rather symmetrically into the two polar atmospheres, due to the geomagnetic dipole field, it is suggested that these asymmetries may be explained in terms of the differences in dynamics between the summer and the winter polar atmospheres. In the summer (northern) hemisphere, the stratospheric and mesospheric ozone depletion and recovery are smooth functions of time due to the preponderance of undistributed orderly flow in this region. On the other hand, the temporal variation of the upper stratospheric ozone in the winter polar atmosphere (southern hemisphere) exhibits large amplitude irregularities. These characteristic differences between the two polar atmospheres are also evident in the vertical distributions of temperatures and winds observed by balloons and rocket soundings...|$|R

The present study on the environmental compatibility of a planned space transport system restricts itself to the lower stage of the SAeNGER space transport system conceived in Germany. This preference of the lower stage had the following reasons: relatively substantiated emission data were available at an early stage; the cruising altitude around 25 km in the ozone layer of the stratosphere indicated an accumulation of the climate relevant emissions water vapor and nitrogen oxides in one layer and thus a potential hazard to the ozone layer; the airbreathing engines of the lower stage, in contrast to the upper stage, lead to nitrogen oxide emissions which together with water vapor increase the concentration of two catalysts that are essentially contributing to ozone depletion in the stratosphere.

5000|$|Sheldon Ungar, a Canadian sociologist, {{assumes that}} while the {{quantity}} of specialized knowledge is exploding, in contrast scientific ignorance among lay people is the norm and even increasing. Public opinion failed to tie climate change to concrete events {{which could be used}} as a threshold or beacon to signify immediate danger. Scientific predictions of a temperature rise of [...] to [...] over several decades do not resonate with people, for example in North America, who experience similar swings during a single day. As scientists define global warming as a problem of the future, a liability in the [...] "attention economy", pessimistic outlooks in general and the attribution of extreme weather to climate change have often been discredited or ridiculed in the public arena (compare the Gore effect). Even when James Hansen tried to use the 1988-89 North American drought as a call to action, scientists kept stating, in line with the IPCC findings, that even extreme weather is not climate. While the greenhouse effect, per se, is essential for life on earth, the case was quite different with the ozone hole and other metaphors about ozone depletion. The scientific assessment of the ozone problem also had large uncertainties; both the <b>ozone</b> <b>content</b> of the upper atmosphere and its depletion are complicated to measure and the link between ozone depletion and rates of enhanced skin cancer is rather weak.

40|$|Soon {{after the}} {{discovery}} of the Antarctic ozone hole it became clear that particles in the polar stratosphere had an infl uence on the destruction of the ozone layer. Two major types of particles, sulphate aerosols and Polar Stratospheric Clouds (PSCs), provide the surfaces where fast heterogeneous chemical reactions convert inactive halogen reservoir species into potentially ozone-destroying radicals. Lidar measurements have been used to classify the PSCs. Following the Mt. Pinatubo eruption in June 1991 {{it was found that the}} Arctic stratosphere was loaded with aerosols, and that aerosols observed with lidar and ozone observed with ozone sondes displayed a layered structure, and that the aerosol and <b>ozone</b> <b>contents</b> in the layers frequently appeared to be negatively correlated. The layered structure was probably due to modulation induced by the dynamics at the edge of the polar vortex. Lidar observations of the Mt. Pinatubo aerosols were in several cases accompanied by balloon-borne backscatter soundings, whereby backscatter measurements in three different wavelengths made it possible to obtain information about the particle sizes. An investigation of the infl uence of synoptic temperature histories on the physical properties of PSC particles has shown that most of the liquid type 1 b particles were observed in the process of an ongoing, relatively fast, and continuous cooling from temperatures clearly above the nitric acid trihydrate condensation temperature (TNAT).

40|$|During the Second SAGE 111 Ozone Loss and Validation Experiment (SOLVE II), the 14 - channel NASA Ames Airborne Trackmg Sunphotometer (AATS- 14) {{was mounted}} on the NASA DC- 8 and {{successfully}} measured spectra of total and aerosol optical depth (TOD and AOD) during the sunlit portions of eight science flights. Values of <b>ozone</b> column <b>content</b> above the aircraft have been derived from the AATS- 14 data by using a linear least squares method. For each AATS- 14 measured TOD spectrum, this method iteratively finds the <b>ozone</b> column <b>content</b> that yields the best match between measured and calculated TOD. The calculations assume the known Chappuis ozone band shape and a three-parameter AOD shape (quadratic in log-log space). Seven of the AATS- 14 channels (each employing an interference filter with a nominal full-width at half maximum bandpass of - 5 nm) are within the Chappuis band, with center wavelengths between 452. 9 nm and 864. 5 nm. One channel (604. 4 nm) is near the peak, and three channels (499. 4, 519. 4 and 675. 1 nm) have ozone absorption within 30 - 40 % of that at the peak. For the typical DC- 8 SOLVE II cruising altitudes of approx. 8 - 12 km and the background stratospheric aerosol conditions that prevailed during SOLVE 11, absorption of incoming solar radiation by ozone comprised a significant fraction of the aerosol-plus-ozone optical depth measured in the four AATS- 14 channels centered between 499. 4 and 675. 1 nm. Typical AODs above the DC- 8 ranged from 0. 003 - 0. 008 in these channels. For comparison, an ozone overburden of 0. 3 atm-cm (300 DU) translates to ozone optical depths of 0. 009, 0. 014, 0. 041, and 0. 012, respectively, at these same wavelengths.

40|$|CO, one of {{the most}} {{important}} trace gases, regulates tropospheric methane, hydroxyl radical, and <b>ozone</b> <b>contents.</b> Ten to 25 % of the estimated global CO flux may be consumed by soils annually. Depth profiles for 14 CO oxidation and CO concentration indicated that CO oxidation occurred primarily in surface soils and that photooxidation of soil organic matter did not necessarily contribute significantly to CO fluxes. Kinetic analyses revealed that the apparent Km was about 18 nM (17 ppm) and the Vmax was 6. 9 μmol g (fresh weight) − 1 h− 1; the apparent Km was similar to the apparent Km for atmospheric methane consumption, but the Vmax was more than 100 times higher. Atmospheric CO oxidation responded sensitively to soil water regimes; decreases in water content in initially saturated soils resulted in increased uptake, and optimum uptake occurred at water contents of 30 to 60 %. However, extended drying led to decreased uptake and net CO production. Rewetting could restore CO uptake, albeit with a pronounced hysteresis. The responses to changing temperatures indicated that the optimum temperature for net uptake was between 20 and 25 °C and that there was a transition to net production at temperatures above 30 °C. The responses to methyl fluoride and acetylene indicated that populations other than ammonia oxidizers and methanotrophs must be involved in forest soils. The response to acetylene was notable, since the strong initial inhibition was reversed after 12 h of incubation; in contrast, methyl fluoride did not have an inhibitory effect. Ammonium did not inhibit CO uptake; the level of nitrite inhibition was initially substantial, but nitrite inhibition was reversible over time. Nitrite inhibition appeared to occur through indirect effects based on abiological formation of NO...|$|R

The focus {{of this study is}} on the composition of the troposphere, mainly associated with ozone which acts as a greenhouse gas, is damaging to living organisms, and co-determines the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere. A coupled tropospheric chemistry - general circulation model (ECHAM) has been applied to the simulation of tropospheric ozone distributions, using emissions of ozone precursors (NOx, CO, higher hydrocarbons) as boundary conditions. The model has been extended with detailed parameterizations for dry deposition of trace species, for the lower stratospheric ozone concentration which is used as boundary condition, and for the treatment of higher hydrocarbon species. The model has been extensively evaluated by comparison with observed long-term climatological data and with in-situ measurements from specific measurement campaigns. A proper representation of all ozone sources and sinks is prerequisite to an accurate estimate of the anthropogenic ozone increase in the troposphere. The representativity of stratosphere-troposphere exchange, which forms a major source for ozone in the troposphere, and its contribution to tropospheric ozone levels has been studied. Simulations have been performed using pre-industrial, present-day and future emission scenarios as boundary conditions, and the radiative forcing associated with the ozone increases has been estimated.
