5|$|As Vandygriff and his {{men began}} pulling back from the mountain, North Korean fire was falling in the platoon area from nearly all directions. The squad leaders started {{to break up the}} weapons that the platoon could not take out with them. At this time they {{discovered}} Brown was dead. Vandygriff told his troops not to remove the identification tags from the dead they would be leaving behind, as the tags would be the only means of identification later. Vandygriff put his platoon in a V formation and led them off the hill by the same trail they had ascended, picking up four wounded men <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{flew into}} the mountain at an angle of 15 to 20 degrees, with the starboard side towards the mountain. The aircraft was ascending at a seven-degree angle, plus/minus one degree. The tip of the starboard wing {{was the first to}} hit the mountain, followed by engine number four (the right-most). The engine was immediately torn off and the aircraft started to rotate. The aircraft started being torn in the back rib of the starboard wing. Then the nose and port wing from engine number two (the inner) hit a depression in the mountain-face, causing engine number one to loosen from its nacelle and the port wing to break between the engines. At the same time the aircraft's body was broken in two. The aircraft's forward movement stopped, the wreck pieces rotated with the vertical stabilizer away from the mountain-side, the port wing caught on fire and exploded {{and the rest of the}} aircraft fell down the slope. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down,</b> the starboard wing caught on fire.|$|E

The crew had started duty at Bodø Airport at 13:30 (Central European Time, UTC+1) and were to make a round trip to Trondheim Airport, with intermediate stops at Sandnessjøen Airport, Mosjøen Airport, Brønnøysund Airport and Rørvik Airport as Flight 711. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down,</b> the flight canceled its stop at Mosjøen because of bad weather.

5|$|In {{the next}} match, Sensational Sherri stood at ringside as Shawn Michaels defended his Intercontinental Championship against Marty Jannetty. She {{did not reveal}} her {{allegiance}} to either man. Jannetty gained the early advantage, knocking Michaels {{out of the ring}} and diving onto him through the ropes. He then attacked Michaels by jumping off the top rope, but Michaels countering this move by hitting him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down.</b> Michaels hit Jannetty's shoulder against the ring post and focused on wearing down the shoulder once both men had re-entered the ring. Michaels missed an attack from the top rope, which allowed Jannetty to punch him repeatedly. Michaels recovered and threw Jannetty out of the ring, but Jannetty then suplexed Michaels over the rope and onto the arena floor. Sherri turned on Michaels by slapping him in the face, and Jannetty threw Michaels back into the ring with a belly-to-back suplex. Jannetty performed a powerslam and a DDT on Michaels. Michaels attempted to punch Jannetty but knocked the referee unconscious instead. Sherri came into the ring and tried to hit Michaels with her shoe. Michaels moved out of the way, and Sherri hit Jannetty instead. When the referee recovered, Michaels performed a superkick on Jannetty and pinned him to retain the championship.|$|E
5|$|When {{the safety}} car {{came in on}} lap42, Hamilton led, while Heidfeld and Piquet were running second and third. Behind them were Massa, Kubica, Kovalainen, Trulli, Vettel, Alonso, Webber, Rosberg and Räikkönen. Webber's Red Bull had been {{dripping}} oil {{for a couple of}} laps after picking up debris from Glock's crash, and on lap40 he pulled out of the race. Räikkönen quickly passed Rosberg, and then overtook the squabbling Vettel and Alonso <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> to the hairpin, while Hamilton desperately tried to pull away at the front. Räikkönen passed Trulli twolaps later, while Kovalainen overtook Kubica for fifth place. Coulthard and Barrichello collided on the 48thlap with both cars pitting for repairs. Barrichello retired threelaps later due to damage sustained {{as a result of the}} incident. Hamilton pitted on lap50, coming out behind Heidfeld, Piquet, Massa and Kovalainen. Kovalainen let his teammate past at the hairpin one lap later, meaning that Hamilton was now fourth. On lap52, Heidfeld set a new fastest lap time of 1:15.987. He was the only driver to go under one minute 16 seconds during the Grand Prix. At the end of the following lap, Heidfeld entered the pits with a sizeable gap over Piquet, returning to the field comfortably ahead of Kovalainen, but behind Hamilton.|$|E

50|$|As {{with all}} weight {{training}} movements, {{it is important}} to keep the weight under smooth control <b>on</b> both <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> and <b>the</b> <b>way</b> up.

As with most weight training exercises, it is recommended to start off with a lighter weight and then to gradually increase the weight as the muscles get stronger.|$|R
25|$|By {{creating}} this system, information flow was primarily in one direction, {{and continued to}} be split out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down.</b> For instance, the filter room might be receiving 15 reports per minute from various CH sites, but these would be about formations that might cover the entire coast of Great Britain. Portions of these reports, say those over Kent, {{would be sent to}} 11 Group, while others, the attack on RAF Driffield for instance, would only be relayed to 13 Group. In turn, 11 Group's operations room would relay only those tracks of interest down to the sectors, filtering out tracks that were out of their range, or being handled by other sectors. Finally, the sector operators only had to relay information to the pilots that actually had an effect on their flight– data about other formations was not relayed, freeing the radio time.|$|E

Paifu makes a daring rescue by learning flight at the last minute and saves Maruyama and himself from immediate death. On the way back, Maruyama talks of how he is going to buy a boat with the money he makes forcing Paifu to reveal that he had lied to him about the payment of 1,000,000 yen. Maruyama admits that he is disappointed, but not infuriated as Paifu saved his life. The four are praised as they returned to the village. One month later, Paifu, Jose and everyone else from the village meet Maruyama out at sea with a ghost boat that all fixed up together.|$|E
25|$|Later that night, DDP and Rhyno faced Kane and the Undertaker. During the match, {{there was}} {{interference}} from the Alliance.

Backstage, many WWF and Alliance wrestlers were fighting each other, and the WWF {{seemed to be on}} the losing end of things. A truck was seen driving up to the arena, however, and Austin came out with his cue stick and proceeded to beat down any WCW and ECW wrestlers in his path.

25|$|Their first-round match-up with Cleveland {{was widely}} seen as the most evenly matched series in the 2006 NBA Playoffs. The teams {{exchanged}} wins {{during the first two}} games in Cleveland, with Game 2 highlighted by the Wizards holding LeBron James to 7–25 shooting from the floor while Brendan Haywood gave James a hard foul in the first quarter that many cited as the key to shaking up the rest of James's game. In Game 3 at the Verizon Center, James hit a 4-footer <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> with 5.7 seconds left to take the game and the series lead for the Cavs with a 97–96 win.

Yet in Games 5 and 6, the Cavs would take control of the series, both games decided by one point in overtime.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, Messner {{succeeded in}} {{climbing}} Manaslu {{on what was}} then the totally unknown south face of the mountain, of which there were not even any pictures. From the last high-altitude camp he climbed with Frank Jäger, who turned back before reaching the summit. Shortly after Messner reached the summit, the weather changed and heavy fog and snow descended. Initially Messner became lost <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down,</b> but later found {{his way back to the}} camp, where Horst Fankhauser and Andi Schlick were waiting for him and Jäger. Jäger did not return, although his cries were heard from the camp. Orientation had become too difficult. Fankhauser and Schlick began to search for him that evening, but lost their way and sought shelter at first in a snow cave. Messner himself was no longer in a position to help the search. The following day, only Horst Fankhauser returned. Andi Schlick had left the snow cave during the night and become lost. So the expedition had to mourn the loss of two climbers. Messner was later criticised for having let Franz Jäger go back down the mountain alone.|$|E
