5|$|Gerard was {{a patron}} <b>of</b> <b>learning,</b> <b>to</b> {{the extent that}} he urged at least one of his clergy to study Hebrew, a {{language}} not commonly studied at that time. He himself was a student of astrology, which led to suggestions that he was a magician and a sorcerer. Partly because of such rumours, and his unpopular attempts to reform his cathedral clergy, Gerard was denied a burial inside York Minster after his sudden death in 1108. His successor as archbishop subsequently had Gerard's remains moved into the cathedral church from their initial resting place beside the cathedral porch.|$|E

These effects are particularly dangerous because a diver may feel they are not experiencing narcosis, yet still be affected by it.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} later Luis is elected Chair of the ship's ruling council, and helps bring about a {{settlement}} wherein the people on board can choose {{whether or not to}} stay on the ship, and also choose whether the ship stays in orbit around Hsin Ti Chiu. Hsing has a child by Hiroshi, but Hiroshi dies soon afterward, of heart failure. The ship's educational curriculum is revised, and all schools are required to allow teachers who are not angels to teach material relevant to living on the new planet. The new planet proves to be habitable by humans, and around a quarter of the ship's population moves to it, settling down despite the difficulty <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> live on a planet again. The ship leaves, not intending to return.|$|E

5|$|Handel's {{earliest}} opera compositions, in the German style, {{date from}} his Hamburg years, 1704–06, {{under the influence}} of Johann Mattheson. In 1706 he traveled to Italy where he remained for three years, developing his compositional skills. He first settled in Florence where he was introduced to Alessandro and Domenico Scarlatti. His first opera composed in Italy, though still reflecting the influence of Hamburg and Mattheson, was Rodrigo (1707, original title Vincer se stesso ê la maggior vittoria), was presented there. It was not particularly successful, but was part of Handel's process <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> compose opera in the Italian style and to set Italian words to music.|$|E
5|$|Political {{and social}} trends {{of the late}} 1970s shifted away from the early 1970s hippie attitudes that had led to the genre's {{development}} and popularity. The rise in punk cynicism made the utopian ideals expressed in progressive rock lyrics unfashionable. Virtuosity was rejected, as the expense of purchasing quality instruments and the time investment <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> play them were seen as barriers to rock's energy and immediacy. There were also changes in the music industry, as record companies disappeared and merged into large media conglomerates. Promoting and developing experimental music {{was not part of}} the marketing strategy for these large corporations, who focused their attention on identifying and targeting profitable market niches.|$|E
5|$|Population {{declined}} {{in the first half}} of the 14th century, starting with the Great Famine in 1315, followed by the Black Death of 1348–50. Despite the decline, however, German artists, engineers, and scientists developed a wide array of techniques similar to those used by the Italian artists and designers of the time who flourished in such merchant city-states as Venice, Florence and Genoa. Artistic and cultural centres throughout the German states produced such artists as the Augsburg painters Hans Holbein and his son, and Albrecht Dürer. Johannes Gutenberg introduced moveable-type printing to Europe, a development that laid the basis for the spread <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> the masses.|$|E

5|$|The {{book has}} often been {{described}} as a Bildungsroman or coming of age story, as it explores Ged's process <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> cope with power and come to terms with death. The novel also carries Taoist themes about a fundamental balance in the universe of Earthsea, which wizards are supposed to maintain, closely tied to the idea that language and names have power to affect the material world and alter this balance. Although the structure of the story {{is similar to that of}} a traditional epic, critics have also described it as subverting this genre in many ways, such as by making the protagonist dark-skinned, in comparison to more typical white-skinned heroes.|$|E

As soon as she could walk, her mother said, she was following her about, book in hand, begging to be taught to read stories for herself. She read them soon to so much purpose that before she was five years old, she had finished the Bible, being rewarded by a polyglot Testament for the feat, and had also read Plutarch, which at every subsequent reading gave her an equal pleasure, and at seven, had mastered Racine in the original, upon which she began the study of Latin with her father.|$|E
