5|$|The bulk of {{information}} about Lōʻihi comes from dives made {{in response to the}} 1996 eruption. In a dive conducted almost immediately after seismic activity was reported, visibility was greatly reduced by high concentrations of displaced minerals and large floating mats of bacteria in the water. The bacteria that feed on the dissolved nutrients had already begun colonizing the new hydrothermal vents at Pele's Pit (formed from the collapse of the old ones), and may be indicators <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> of material ejected from the newly formed vents. They were carefully sampled for further analysis in a laboratory. An OBO briefly sat on the summit before a more permanent probe could be installed.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} such experiments.

25|$|Nevertheless, a {{conditional}} correspondence exists. There {{are three}} relevant kinds of wall here: purely diathermal, adiabatic, and permeable to matter.

25|$|Many {{philosophers}} {{throughout history}} had, arguably, {{been tempted to}} reduce two {{of these kinds of}} belief and knowledge to the other one: René Descartes and David Hume thought that the only knowledge that people start with is self-knowledge. Some logical positivists (and some would say Wittgenstein, or Wilfrid Sellars) held that people start with beliefs only about the external world. (Arguably, Friedrich Schelling and Emmanuel Levinas held that people start with beliefs only about other people.) It is not possible, on Davidson's view, for a person to have only one of the three kinds of mental content; anyone who has beliefs of one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> must have beliefs of the other two kinds.|$|E

500|$|All of {{the fossils}} are oval in outline. [...] Elongated {{specimens}} illustrate that the organism {{was capable of}} stretching in an anterior-posterior direction, perhaps {{by as much as}} a factor of two. The only type of symmetry visible in the White Sea specimens is bilateral; {{there is no sign of}} any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> of radial symmetry that are normal in the Cnidaria, the group that includes jellyfish, sea anemones and hydras. The Australian fossils were originally described as a type of jellyfish, but this is inconsistent with the bilateral symmetry in the fossils. The White Sea fossils and the surrounding sediments also show that Kimberella lived on the surface of the sea-floor.|$|E

The revised text became the second edition, published in 1951 in both the UK and the US.|$|E

500|$|Another {{influence}} from Old English sources is {{the appearance of}} named blades of renown, adorned in runes. In using his elf-blade Bilbo finally takes his first independent heroic action. By his naming the blade [...] "Sting" [...] we see Bilbo's acceptance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> of cultural and linguistic practices found in Beowulf, signifying his entrance into the ancient world in which he found himself. This progression culminates in Bilbo stealing a cup from the dragon's hoard, rousing him to wrath—an incident directly mirroring Beowulf and an action entirely determined by traditional narrative patterns. As Tolkien wrote, [...] "The episode of the theft arose naturally (and almost inevitably) from the circumstances. It is difficult to think of any other way of conducting the story at this point. I fancy the author of Beowulf would say much the same." ...|$|E
500|$|Music {{journalist}} Paul Lester locates [...] "the {{golden age}} of adroit, intelligent art-pop" [...] to when the bands 10cc, Roxy Music and Sparks [...] "were mixing and matching from different genres and eras, well before the term 'postmodern' existed in the pop realm." [...] The effect of the Velvet Underground gave rock musicians like Iggy Pop of the Stooges a self-consciousness about their work. Iggy was inspired to transform his personality into an art object, which would in turn influence singer David Bowie, {{and led to the}} Stooges' role as the group linking 1960s hard rock to 1970s punk. In the 1970s, a similarly self-conscious art/pop community (which Frith calls [...] "the most significant" [...] of the period) began to coalesce in the Mercer Arts Center in New York. The school encouraged the continuation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> of collaboration between high and low art once exemplified by the Factory, as drummer Jerry Harrison (later of Talking Heads) explained: [...] "it started with the Velvet Underground and {{all of the things that}} were identified with Andy Warhol." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ozu {{was widely}} noted for a style {{characterized}} by a frequent avoidance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> of camera movements—such as panning shots, tracking shots or crane shots—employed by most film directors. (As he himself would sometimes remark, [...] "I'm not a dynamic director like Akira Kurosawa.") Bordwell notes that, of all the common technical practices that Ozu refused to emulate, he was [...] "most absolute" [...] in refusing to reframe (for example, by panning slightly) the moving human figure {{in order to keep}} it in view; this critic claims {{that there is not a}} single reframing in all of Ozu's films from 1930 on. In the late films (that is, those from Late Spring on), the director [...] "will use walls, screens, or doors to block off the sides of the frame so that people walk into a central depth," [...] thus maintaining focus on the human figure without any motion of the camera.|$|E
