5|$|A viral genome, {{irrespective}} of nucleic acid type, {{is almost always}} either single-stranded or double-stranded. Single-stranded genomes consist of an unpaired nucleic acid, analogous to <b>one-half</b> of a ladder split down the middle. Double-stranded genomes consist of two complementary paired nucleic acids, analogous to a ladder. The virus particles of some virus families, such as those belonging to the Hepadnaviridae, contain a genome that is partially double-stranded and partially single-stranded.|$|E
5|$|After being {{signed by}} WWE, the {{brothers}} worked as enhancement talents, before gaining notoriety in the tag team division, {{partly due to}} their participation in Tables, Ladders and Chairs matches. With the addition of Lita, the team became known as Team Xtreme and continued to rise in popularity. As a tag team wrestler, Hardy is an 11-time world tag team champion (six World Tag Team Championships, one WCW Tag Team Championship, one Raw Tag Team Championship, two TNA World Tag Team Championships, and one ROH World Tag Team Championship) – all with his brother Matt. On the independent circuit, Jeff was also <b>one-half</b> of the OMEGA Tag Team Champions with Matt in their second reign and <b>one-half</b> of the Crash Tag Team Champions with Matt in their first reign.|$|E

5|$|A notable {{physical}} {{difference between}} these metals is their density, with zirconium having about <b>one-half</b> the density of hafnium. The most notable nuclear properties of hafnium are its high thermal neutron-capture cross-section and that the nuclei of several different hafnium isotopes readily absorb two or more neutrons apiece. In contrast with this, zirconium is practically transparent to thermal neutrons, and {{it is commonly used}} for the metal components of nuclear reactors – especially the cladding of their nuclear fuel rods.|$|E
5|$|As of 2010, Canadians make up 0.5% of the world's total population, having {{relied upon}} {{immigration}} for {{population growth and}} social development. Approximately 41% of current Canadians are first- or second-generation immigrants, and 20% of Canadian residents in the 2000s were not born in the country. Statistics Canada projects that, by 2031, nearly <b>one-half</b> of Canadians above the age of 15 will be foreign-born or have one foreign-born parent. Indigenous peoples, according to the 2011 Canadian Census, numbered at 1,400,685 or 4.3% of the country's 33,476,688 population.|$|E
5|$|As the Polish troops {{entered the}} city, the first pogrom in modern Vilnius started, {{as noted by}} the Timothy D. Snyder, citing Michał Pius Römer. Dozens of people {{connected}} with the Lit-Bel were arrested, and some were executed; Norman Davies cites a death toll for all – Jews and non-Jews, under Polish rule – as 65. Jews constituted close to <b>one-half</b> of Vilnius's population, according to the German census of 1916, and many victims of fighting and subsequent repression in Vilnius were Jews. Henry Morgenthau, Sr. counted 65, Joseph W. Bendersky counted over a hundred.|$|E
5|$|Davis {{started a}} {{pineapple}} plantation on Key Biscayne; six acres (two-and-a-half hectares) {{had been cleared}} and planted in pineapples in 1893–94. Davis also directed his caretaker to plant <b>one-half</b> to one acre (two-tenths to four-tenths of a hectare) of bananas. By 1898, {{a great variety of}} tropical fruit trees had been planted on the island. Davis also had a large dwelling built for his use. It was a two-story cottage with five bedrooms and verandas on three sides, raised ten feet above the ground on pilings to protect against storm surges.|$|E
5|$|Finance chair Walter M. Gibson, {{supported}} by Minister of the Interior Samuel G. Wilder, pushed a new currency law through the 1880 legislature. It allowed the kingdom to purchase {{gold and silver}} bullion to be struck into new Hawaiian coins. Having the kingdom issue its own coins was one {{means by which the}} government hoped to improve Native Hawaiian morale, as their numbers and their influence had both been declining over the previous few decades. The king became more interested in coinage bearing his likeness during his world tour of 1881. During this journey, he was contacted by the owner of a New Caledonia nickel mining company hoping to use the metal in coinage, and sample five-cent pieces were sent to the king after his return to Honolulu. They found little favor, possibly because Hawaii's motto was misspelled. No action was taken until 1882, when the king appointed Gibson to lead the government. He moved forward with the coin idea; the currency was to have the king's image on the obverse side, and Hawaii's coat of arms and motto Ua Mau ke Ea o ka ʻĀina i ka Pono (The Life of the Land is Perpetuated in Righteousness) on the reverse. The 1880 law specified that the silver coins were to be in denominations of one dollar, fifty cents, twenty-five cents, and twelve and <b>one-half</b> cents. Twelve and <b>one-half</b> cents, or one bit (one Spanish colonial real) was sometimes the day's pay for a laborer.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, the United States and Canada {{signed the}} Columbia River Treaty, {{which focused on}} flood control and the {{maximization}} of downstream power generation. Canada agreed to build dams and provide reservoir storage, and the United States agreed to deliver to Canada <b>one-half</b> {{of the increase in}} USdownstream power benefits as estimated five years in advance. Canada's obligation was met by building three dams (two on the Columbia, and one on the Duncan River), the last of which was completed in 1973.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{scientists}} and engineers {{have contributed to the}} advancement of agricultural sciences, electronics, industrial robotics, optics, chemicals, semiconductors, life sciences and various fields of engineering. Japan leads the world in robotics production and use, possessing more than 20% (300,000 of 1.3 million) of the world's industrial robots —though its share was historically even higher, representing <b>one-half</b> of all industrial robots worldwide in 2000. Japan boasts the third highest number of scientists, technicians, and engineers per capita in the world with 83 scientists, technicians and engineers per 10,000 employees.|$|E
5|$|Operation Freedom Deal {{followed}} Operation Menu. Under Freedom Deal, from 19 May 1970 to 15 August 1973, U.S. {{bombing of}} Cambodia extended {{over the entire}} eastern <b>one-half</b> {{of the country and}} was especially intense in the heavily populated southeastern one-quarter of the country, including a wide ring surrounding the largest city of Phnom Penh. In large areas, according to maps of U.S. bombing sites, it appears that nearly every square mile of land was hit by bombs.|$|E
5|$|Shepherd {{satellites}} {{are small}} moons that orbit within, or just beyond, a planet's ring system. They {{have the effect}} of sculpting the rings: giving them sharp edges, and creating gaps between them. Saturn's shepherd moons are Pan (Encke gap), Daphnis (Keeler gap), Atlas (A Ring), Prometheus (F Ring) and Pandora (F Ring). These moons together with co-orbitals (see below) probably formed as a result of accretion of the friable ring material on preexisting denser cores. The cores with sizes from one-third to <b>one-half</b> the present day moons may be themselves collisional shards formed when a parental satellite of the rings disintegrated.|$|E
5|$|TNA {{management}} {{were very}} upset with Sean Waltman after {{he failed to}} appear {{to participate in the}} Four Way Elimination Tag Team match. This anger was due to Waltman being <b>one-half</b> of the winners of the Chris Candido Memorial Tag Team Tournament. Despite not appearing on the show, Waltman was in Orlando and dressed to compete, but did not arrive at the arena in time. Waltman was not used by TNA until January15, 2006 when he appeared at their Final Resolution PPV event.|$|E
5|$|The {{foundation}} document stipulated that fees {{were to be}} fixed by the governors and could range from £4–8 per year; in 1888, the fees charged were £7/10s per year. Provision was made for the allocation of scholarships {{to the value of}} the tuition fees for one in every ten boys in the school; <b>one-half</b> of the scholarships were arranged by the governors and awarded only to boys who had spent three years education in a public elementary school. Around the turn of the 20thcentury, an attempt was made to attract younger boys into the school by reducing fees for those under the age of 12 from £2/20s to £2 per term.|$|E
5|$|The jury {{agreed with}} Adams and acquitted {{six of the}} {{soldiers}} after two and <b>one-half</b> hours' deliberation. Two of the soldiers were found guilty of manslaughter because there was overwhelming evidence that they had fired directly into the crowd. The jury's decisions suggest that they believed the soldiers had felt threatened by the crowd, but should have delayed firing. Patrick Carr, the fifth victim, corroborated this with deathbed testimony delivered to his doctor. The convicted soldiers were granted reduced sentences by invoking Benefit of clergy, which reduced their punishment from a death sentence to branding of the thumb in open court.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} flag has {{a length of}} 2.20meters and a width of 1.47m, a ratio of 2 to 3. The field is split into three horizontal colored bands, a yellow band of <b>one-half</b> the flag's width, a blue band of one-quarter the width, and a red band of one-quarter the width. All three bands extend {{the full length of}} the flag. The flag is charged with the Ecuadorian coat of arms scaled to <b>one-half</b> the width of the flag and centered in the field. The coat of arms itself is constructed in a rectangle with proportions 12:10. The national standard has the same design as the {{national flag}}, but is square, with length 0.9m and width 0.9m. When used by military units and organizations, lettering can encircle the coat of arms with a diameter of 55 centimeters. The lettering must be 4cm in height, 3cm in width, gold-colored Roman font, embroidered with gold thread. The only other regulated size is a table flag (banderola) where the flag is 200mm wide and 300mm long. When manufacturing the national flag, sellers to the public must include the name of their company, along with the year of manufacture, by placing a 20 × 10mm tag on the reverse side of the flag on the sleeve.|$|E
5|$|Vmax is {{only one}} of several {{important}} kinetic parameters. The amount of substrate needed to achieve a given rate of reaction is also important. This is given by the Michaelis-Menten constant (Km), which is the substrate concentration required for an enzyme to reach <b>one-half</b> its maximum reaction rate; generally, each enzyme has a characteristic Km for a given substrate. Another useful constant is kcat, also called the turnover number, which is the number of substrate molecules handled by one active site per second.|$|E
5|$|Warenne offered King John 500 {{marks for}} licence to marry Melisent, {{the widow of}} Richard de Mountfichet, lord of the manor of Stansted in Essex. Warenne's only {{surviving}} child and sole-heiress was his daughter, Beatrice, whom he married to Doun Bardolf, the holder of a <b>one-half</b> moiety of the feudal barony of Shelford in Nottinghamshire. Beatrice married secondly Ralph, and thirdly Hubert de Burgh. Beatrice had a son, William Bardolf, by her first marriage, who became the eventual heir of his maternal grandfather. Bardolf's rights to the barony were controlled by Beatrice's third husband, who did not relinquish them {{until his death in}} 1243.|$|E
5|$|Adam Gutschmidt, {{reviewing}} the event for Online Onslaught, gave {{a rating of}} one-quarter star for the Nightstick on a Pole match and <b>one-half</b> star each for the High Energy vs. The Headshrinkers match and the Yokozuna vs. Virgil match. He enjoyed the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match, although he was disappointed by its lack of buildup prior to the event. He also felt that the Flair/Ramon vs. Savage/Perfect match {{was a good one}} until the ending got out of control. Pro Wrestling Torch columnist agreed, stating that the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match was the best and that the Flair/Ramon vs. Savage/Perfect bout was also enjoyable, but he recommended fast-forwarding {{through the rest of the}} show.|$|E
5|$|Although {{women were}} on a lower social tier than men (according to Confucian ethics), they enjoyed many social and legal {{privileges}} and wielded considerable power {{at home and in}} their own small businesses. As Song society became more and more prosperous and parents on the bride's side of the family provided larger dowries for her marriage, women naturally gained many new legal rights in ownership of property. Under certain circumstances, an unmarried daughter without brothers, or a surviving mother without sons, could inherit <b>one-half</b> of her father's share of undivided family property. There were many notable and well-educated women, and it was a common practice for women to educate their sons during their earliest youth. The mother of the scientist, general, diplomat, and statesman Shen Kuo taught him essentials of military strategy. There were also exceptional women writers and poets, such as Li Qingzhao (1084–1151), who became famous even in her lifetime.|$|E
5|$|At age sixteen, Stone began {{teaching}} in district schools, as her brothers and sister, Rhoda, also did. Her beginning pay of $1.00 a day was {{much lower than}} that of male teachers, and when she substituted for her brother, Bowman, one winter, she received less pay than he received. When she protested to the school committee that she had taught all the subjects Bowman had, it replied that they could give her “only a woman’s pay.” Lower pay for women was one of the arguments cited by those promoting the hiring of women as teachers: “To make education universal, it must be at moderate expense, and women can afford to teach for <b>one-half,</b> or even less, the salary which men would ask.” Although Stone’s salary increased along with the size of her schools, until she finally received $16 a month, it was always lower than the male rate.|$|E
5|$|Business US Highway127 (Bus. US127) {{starts at}} the Price Road {{interchange}} along US127 south of St. Johns. From here, Bus. US127 follows Price Road to the former US27 and turns north along South Old US27. In the city of St Johns, it is known as Whittemore Street and intersects M-21 (State Street). Bus. US127 continues north on North Old US27 to its northern terminus. The northern terminus of Bus. US127 nearly coincides with {{the northern end of}} the existing US127 freeway in Clinton County. Approximately <b>one-half</b> mile (0.8km) north of the Bus. US127 interchange north of St. Johns, the US127 freeway merges back onto its former alignment to proceed northerly into Gratiot County.|$|E
5|$|In 1967 U.S. recon {{photographs}} uncovered {{an unusual}} sight. POL barrels were spotted {{floating in the}} waters of the Kong River south of Ban Bak, Laos. Soon, PAVN was making use of the Banghiang River which flowed southwestward from the Demilitarized Zone {{all the way to the}} Mekong River, for the same purposes. The watertight drums were launched en masse from tributary streams into the main channel, floated downstream, and were recovered by systems of nets and booms. The Kaman River was added to the system in 1969. By 1970 the North Vietnamese were making intense use of streams and rivers to supplement their logistical route, especially in the rainy season, when the water levels rose and the roadways became impassable mires. During one two and <b>one-half</b> month period during 1969, over 10,000 POL barrels were spotted in the waterways of southeastern Laos.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, CenturyLink Field {{became the}} first stadium in the NFL to install a FieldTurf {{artificial}} field. The surface is made of plastic fibers rooted {{in a mixture of}} ground rubber and sand. The field was replaced in the spring of 2008 after tests showed that compression of the sand and rubber increased the risk of player injuries. FieldTurf won the bid for the second installation over Polytan. For the replacement surface, a one-inch (two and <b>one-half</b> centimeters) poured rubber foundation was added to prevent the compression from reoccurring. Under the naming rights agreement, Qwest paid $500,000 for the installation and First & Goal paid the remaining amount, which was undisclosed. By 2010 the FieldTurf's quality had decreased with the blades becoming matted down. It also failed FIFA's quality testing to be ranked 2 Star. A new FieldTurf surface was laid down in 2012 and it met the requirements of a 2 Star field after testing.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the war, the majority of finance for the Southern government came via duties on international trade. The import tariff, enacted in May 1861, was set at 12.5% and it roughly matched in coverage the previously existing Federal tariff, the Tariff of 1857. Between February 17 and May 1 of 1861, 65% of all government revenue was raised from the import tariff. However, revenue from the tariffs all but disappeared after the Union imposed its blockade of Southern coasts. By November 1861 the proportion of government revenue coming from custom duties had dropped to <b>one-half</b> of one percent. Secretary of Treasure Memminger had expected that the tariff would bring in about 25 million dollars in revenue in the first year alone. In fact, the total revenue raised in this way during the entire war was only about $3.4 million.|$|E
5|$|M-116 {{begins in}} Ludington at the {{intersection}} of James Street and Ludington Avenue. It is at this intersection where US10 turns southward and heads to the Ludington–Manitowoc ferry docks. From here, M-116 continues westward along Ludington Avenue through a mixed commercial area for about <b>one-half</b> mile (0.8km) before turning north on Lakeshore Drive. The road continues as North Lakeshore Drive through resident areas and passes the Lakeview Cemetery. Before passing the Lincoln Hills Golf Club, M-116 crosses a narrow section of Lincoln Lake and then curves westward towards the shore of Lake Michigan as it approaches the state park. The route runs along the coast of Lake Michigan for the remainder of its route, through an area of sand dunes, until reaching its northern terminus at the entrance to Ludington State Park.|$|E
