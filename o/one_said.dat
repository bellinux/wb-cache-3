500|$|A {{vibrant and}} {{harmonious}} community sprung {{up on the}} road, which even won the begrudging respect of the authorities.

500|$|Devil Children has {{received}} {{a wide range of}} reviews, ranging from negative to positive. Writers at Famitsu commented that the series did not change much between installments, although <b>one</b> <b>said</b> they enjoyed the stability and reliability in that. Kurt Kalata and Christopher J. Snelgrove of Hardcore Gaming 101 described the games as [...] "relatively decent for being fairly conventional RPGs".|$|E
500|$|Although {{received}} poorly by critics, {{the pilot}} managed to finish first among total viewers and adults 18–49 for its night. Many critics criticized the acting and the writing; <b>one</b> <b>said</b> {{that it had}} the [...] "worst writing of the new season". A few found {{that even though the}} series did not seem great, it [...] "had potential". Jason Dohring's performance was praised, and one critic wished that he had [...] "a bit more screen time".|$|E
500|$|On Wednesday, April 30, a coroner's inquest was held. Frank testified {{about his}} {{activities}} on Saturday and other witnesses produced corroboration.

You get Britney releasing [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] and Gaga's [...] "Born This Way" [...] available on iTunes the day you hear it first. That's how it should be.

500|$|The {{first episode}} of the anime series was called the [...] "masterpiece of the new season" [...] by ANN, which also complimented the musical score as [...] "understated but highly effective". Two reviewers at ANN gave it the highest {{possible}} rating, and <b>one</b> <b>said</b> {{that he would have}} given it a higher rating if possible. Another praised its [...] "honest and heartfelt storytelling" [...] while saying {{it would be easy to}} call the episode's pacing [...] "almost too-languid". A fourth reviewer found it to be typical of Adachi anime adaptations, but that the production values were [...] "at best, mediocre and, at times, brushing up against the marginal".|$|E
500|$|Johnny Herbert, who had {{previously}} been Zanardi's teammate in Formula <b>One,</b> <b>said</b> of the incident, [...] "It's a big shock to everybody. You have accidents, yes, but you don't expect something this gruesome." [...] Laz Denes, a spokesman for Zanardi's Mo Nunn Racing team, said the impact was [...] "immense, almost harder than anything I've ever seen." [...] According to Denes, the point of contact [...] "was about 12 inches past the cockpit," [...] and he called Zanardi's survival a [...] "miracle". Tagliani commented several days after the crash that Zanardi was constantly in his thoughts. During his hospital stay, Zanardi contacted Tagliani {{and told him that}} he was not at fault.|$|E

500|$|While Rand {{was working}} as a script reader for Paramount Pictures, her boss put her in touch with the Bobbs-Merrill Company. A {{recently}} hired editor, Archibald Ogden, liked the book, but two internal reviewers gave conflicting opinions. <b>One</b> <b>said</b> it was a great book that would never sell; the other said it was trash but would sell well. Ogden's boss, Bobbs-Merrill president D.L. Chambers, decided to reject the book. Ogden responded by wiring to the head office, [...] "If this is not the book for you, then I am not the editor for you." [...] His strong stand won Rand the contract on December 10, 1941. She also got a $1,000 advance so she could work full-time to complete the novel by January 1, 1943.|$|E
500|$|... 15 illustrators {{responded to}} the letter; three {{declined}} to participate, one {{did not know how}} to contribute to what he called a vague project, one thought the project was stupid and badly paid, and <b>one</b> <b>said</b> he was afraid. 12 drawings had been submittedthree from newspaper employees and two which did not directly show Muhammad. The editors thought that some of the illustrators who had not responded were employed by other newspapers and were thus contractually prohibited from working for Jyllands-Posten. In the end, editor-in-chief Carsten Juste decided that given its inconclusive results, the story was better suited as an opinion piece rather than a news story, and it was decided to publish it in the culture section, entirely under the direction of editor Flemming Rose.|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews, however, were negative. Sarah Stegall of SF Scope {{gave the}} pilot a decent review, {{and said that}} if Moonlight could survive [...] "the Friday night time slot" [...] and the [...] "thwarted {{expectations}} of [...] fans who were expecting Blade", {{she thought it would}} [...] "rock". Kara Howland of TV Guide gave the pilot a positive review, and thought it was a [...] "solid start". Several critics praised Jason Dohring's portrayal of Josef. <b>One</b> <b>said</b> that he gave the pilot [...] "a small burst of energy", while another said that he made it [...] "crackle with a bit of wit". Dohring was described as [...] "a welcome presence", and one critic wished for [...] "a bit more screen time".

500|$|In 2002 Schapira interviewed three {{anonymous}} Israeli soldiers, [...] "Ariel, Alexej and Idan," [...] {{who said}} they had been on duty at the IDF post that day. They knew something was about to happen, <b>one</b> <b>said,</b> because of the camera crews that had gathered. One soldier said the live fire started from the high-rise Palestinian blocks known as [...] "the twins"; the shooter was firing at the IDF post, he said. The soldier added that he had not seen the al-Durrahs. The Israelis returned fire on a Palestinian station 30 metres {{to the left of the}} al-Durrahs. Their weapons were equipped with optics that allowed them to fire accurately, according to the soldier, and none of them had switched to automatic fire. In the view of the soldier, the shooting of Jamal and Muhammad was no accident. The shots did not come from the Israeli position, he said.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, John Myles, who had {{replaced}} Salt {{and who now}} led the Canningites, had been gathering witnesses who could claim they had seen Mary Squires {{in the vicinity of}} Enfield Wash. [...] <b>One</b> <b>said</b> he had seen two men dragging a woman towards Enfield early in January. [...] Others told him they had on 29January seen [...] "a miserable poor wretch" [...] travelling toward London. [...] Myles found witnesses who claimed they had seen Squires at Enfield Wash in December and January. [...] Myles unwittingly made Gascoyne aware of his investigation when he asked a John Cooper of Salisbury his opinion of seven of Gascoyne's witnesses, who claimed they had seen Squires in Coombe. [...] Cooper wrote back affirming the good character of Thomas Greville (who had testified for Squires at her trial), but later sent the same information to Gascoyne, offering his support.|$|E
500|$|Walton of The Moving Picture News, who {{typically}} praised Thanhouser films, deviated {{from the norm}} by immediately dismissing the film as a whole by stating, [...] "This theme is getting threadbare; a foreign film is almost identical. The son's wife acts brutally to her husband's mother; things are set right by a child. Compare Gaumont's Twilight of a Soldier's Life, etc. The acting of the child is charming, and of the old lady a womanly concept – even to details. The wife's grabbing the old lady's bag, umbrella, etc. was, as <b>one</b> <b>said</b> who sat next to me, 'a bit too rushed. This criticism of the theme was accurate because the Gaumont Film Company release had a nearly identical plot except that that [...] "grandma" [...] was an elderly soldier. The similarities between the two films likely are coincidental because the Gaumont film was released four days prior.|$|E
