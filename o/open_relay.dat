25|$|During 2001 Xtra and Actrix (another New Zealand Internet service provider) won a High Court {{injunction}} to force Alan Brown, the maintainer of the <b>Open</b> <b>Relay</b> Behavior-modification System (ORBS) anti-spam blacklist, {{to remove them}} from the list. ORBS was a blacklist of IP addresses relating to open mail relays like those run by Xtra, which enable spammers to send unsolicited bulk e-mail. Hundreds of organisations subscribed to the list, including Bigfoot.com {{and at least one}} other large free mail provider. They rejected e-mail from any IP address listed in ORBS. The court action led (indirectly) to the end of one of the oldest DNSBL services.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most famous}} open mail relay {{operating}} today is probably that of John Gilmore, who argues that running an <b>open</b> <b>relay</b> {{is a free}} speech issue. His server is included on many <b>open</b> <b>relay</b> blacklists (many of which are generated by [...] "automatic detection", that is, by anti-spam blacklisters sending an (unsolicited) test e-mail to other servers {{to see if they}} will be relayed). These measures cause much of his outgoing e-mail to be blocked. Along with his further deliberate configuration of the server, his <b>open</b> <b>relay</b> enables people to send e-mail without their IP address being directly visible to the recipient and thereby send e-mail anonymously. In 2002, his <b>open</b> <b>relay,</b> along with 24 others, was used by a computer worm to propagate.|$|E

50|$|In response, mail system administrators {{concerned}} about spam began {{to demand that}} other mail operators configure MTAs to cease being <b>open</b> <b>relays.</b> The first DNSBLs, such as MAPS RBL and the now-defunct ORBS, aimed chiefly at allowing mail sites to refuse mail from known <b>open</b> <b>relays.</b> By 2003 less than 1% of corporate mail servers were available as <b>open</b> <b>relays,</b> down from 91% in 1997.|$|R
50|$|Others started DNS-based blacklists of <b>open</b> <b>relays.</b>|$|R
50|$|Internet {{initiatives}} to close <b>open</b> <b>relays</b> have ultimately missed their intended purpose because spammers have created distributed botnets of zombie computers that contain malware with mail relaying capability. The {{number of clients}} under spammers' control is now so great that previous anti-spam countermeasures that focused on closing <b>open</b> <b>relays</b> are no longer effective.|$|R
50|$|Soon {{after the}} advent of the RBL, others started {{developing}} their own lists with different policies. One of the first was Alan Brown's <b>Open</b> <b>Relay</b> Behavior-modification System (ORBS). This used automated testing to discover and list mail servers running as open mail relaysâ€”exploitable by spammers to carry their spam. ORBS was controversial at the time because many people felt running an <b>open</b> <b>relay</b> was acceptable, and that scanning the Internet for open mail servers could be abusive.|$|E
5000|$|If the MUA {{is badly}} configured, {{it can also}} use a {{different}} relay, such as an outmoded <b>open</b> <b>relay,</b> that often doesn't authenticate the user.|$|E
5000|$|In the mid-1990s, {{with the}} rise of spamming, spammers resorted to {{re-routing}} their e-mail through third party e-mail servers to avoid detection and to exploit the additional resources of these <b>open</b> <b>relay</b> servers. Spammers would send one e-mail to the <b>open</b> <b>relay</b> and (effectively) include a large blind carbon copy list, then the <b>open</b> <b>relay</b> would relay that spam to the entire list. [...] While this greatly reduced the bandwidth requirements for spammers at a time when Internet connections were limited, it forced each spam to be an exact copy and thus easier to detect. After abuse by spammers became widespread, operating an <b>open</b> <b>relay</b> came to be frowned upon among the majority of Internet server administrators and other prominent users. [...] Open relays are recommended against in RFC 2505 and RFC 5321 (which defines SMTP). The exact copy nature of spam using open relays made it easy to create bulk e-mail detection systems such as Vipul's Razor and the Distributed Checksum Clearinghouse. To counter this, spammers were forced to switch to using hash busters to make them less effective and the advantage of using open relays was removed since every copy of spam was [...] "unique" [...] and had to be sent individually.|$|E
50|$|A website {{was created}} in 2001 by Brad Baker called stoporbs.org, to offer {{assistance}} to other mail administrators who had been listed on the ORBS blacklist {{for reasons other than}} <b>open</b> <b>relays.</b> Many administrators felt that by listing servers for other than the reasons advertised (<b>open</b> <b>relays),</b> the list was not reliable for the supposed purpose.|$|R
50|$|NJABL {{maintained}} {{a list of}} known and potential spam sources (<b>open</b> mail <b>relays,</b> <b>open</b> proxies, open form to mail HTTP gateways, dynamic IP pools, and direct spammers) {{for the purpose of}} being able to tag or refuse e-mail and thereby block spam from certain sources. NJABL automatically retests only listed <b>open</b> <b>relays</b> every 90 days.|$|R
50|$|The Internet Mail Consortium (IMC) {{reported}} 55% of mail servers were <b>open</b> <b>relays</b> in 1998, {{but less}} than 1% in 2002.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] 4 x 2.5 {{kilometre}} <b>open</b> <b>relay</b> {{competition of}} the 2014 Winter Paralympics {{was held at}} Laura Biathlon & Ski Complex near Krasnaya Polyana, Sochi. The competition took place on 15 March 2014 ...|$|E
50|$|A server that is {{accessible}} on the wider Internet {{and does not}} enforce these kinds of access restrictions is known as an <b>open</b> <b>relay.</b> This is now generally considered a bad practice worthy of blacklisting.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Open</b> <b>relay</b> {{honeypot}}s include Jackpot, {{written in}} Java by Jack Cleaver; smtpot.py, written in Python by Karl A. Krueger; and spamhole (honeypot)|spamhole, written in C. The Bubblegum Proxypot {{is an open}} source honeypot (or [...] "proxypot").|$|E
50|$|An {{open proxy}} is one which will create {{connections}} for any client to any server, without authentication. Like <b>open</b> <b>relays,</b> <b>open</b> proxies were once relatively common, as many administrators {{did not see}} a need to restrict access to them.|$|R
50|$|Since <b>open</b> mail <b>relays</b> make {{no effort}} to {{authenticate}} the sender of an e-mail, <b>open</b> mail <b>relays</b> are vulnerable to address spoofing.|$|R
5000|$|Related to {{the testing}} regime, which was {{excessive}} {{in the eyes}} of a number of email administrators, Brown's policy of adding servers he was unable to test to the list, {{whether or not they were}} actually <b>open</b> <b>relays,</b> was also a matter of dispute. Another complaint was that <b>open</b> <b>relays</b> that had never sent spam were listed without notice. False listings on ORBS were also alleged, particularly when Brown was engaged in legal or other dispute against the listed party ...|$|R
50|$|Several {{groups had}} cached the lists, retested the open relays, and {{replaced}} ORBS. Running an <b>open</b> <b>relay</b> became even {{a bigger problem}} than before. DNSBLs listing open relays got so effective that spammers shifted to insecure proxy servers.|$|E
50|$|Alan Hodgson started Dorkslayers in September 1998. By November 1998 he {{was forced}} to close, since his {{upstream}} BCTel considered the <b>open</b> <b>relay</b> scanning to be abusive. The successor ORBS project was then moved to Alan Brown in New Zealand.|$|E
50|$|The Can Spam Act of 2003 {{makes it}} illegal to send spam through an <b>open</b> <b>relay</b> in the United States, but makes no {{provision}} regarding sending personal e-mail through them or regarding their operation, although {{the effectiveness of the}} act has been questioned.|$|E
5000|$|Spam still {{flows through}} <b>open</b> <b>relays,</b> but the volume {{is much smaller}} than in 2001 to 2002. While most spam {{originates}} in the U.S., spammers hop through <b>open</b> <b>relays</b> across political boundaries to mask their origin. Honeypot operators may use intercepted relay tests to recognize and thwart attempts to relay spam through their honeypots. [...] "Thwart" [...] may mean [...] "accept the relay spam but decline to deliver it." [...] Honeypot operators may discover other details concerning the spam and the spammer by examining the captured spam messages.|$|R
50|$|<b>Open</b> <b>relays</b> {{have also}} {{resulted}} from security flaws in software, rather than misconfiguration by system administrators. In these cases, security patches {{need to be}} applied to close the relay.|$|R
50|$|<b>Open</b> <b>relays</b> and {{forwarders}} {{are in an}} unlucky {{position with}} regards to this issue, generally they can't guarantee that the MAIL FROM address indicates the originator, and they also can't guarantee that final delivery will succeed.|$|R
50|$|SORBS ("Spam and <b>Open</b> <b>Relay</b> Blocking System") {{is a list}} {{of e-mail}} servers {{suspected}} of sending or relaying spam (a DNS Blackhole List). It has been augmented with complementary lists that include various other classes of hosts, allowing for customized email rejection by its users.|$|E
50|$|These honeypots {{can reveal}} the abuser's IP address and provide bulk spam capture (which enables {{operators}} to determine spammers' URLs and response mechanisms). For <b>open</b> <b>relay</b> honeypots, {{it is possible}} to determine the e-mail addresses ("dropboxes") spammers use as targets for their test messages, which are the tool they use to detect open relays. It is then simple to deceive the spammer: transmit any illicit relay e-mail received addressed to that dropbox e-mail address. That tells the spammer the honeypot is a genuine abusable <b>open</b> <b>relay,</b> and they often respond by sending large quantities of relay spam to that honeypot, which stops it. The apparent source may be another abused systemâ€”spammers and other abusers may use a chain of abused systems to make detection of the original starting point of the abuse traffic difficult.|$|E
50|$|There is an {{informal}} protocol for the addresses returned by DNSBL queries which match. Most DNSBLs return an {{address in the}} 127.0.0.0/8 IP loopback network. The address 127.0.0.2 indicates a generic listing. Other addresses in this block may indicate something specific about the listingâ€”that it indicates an <b>open</b> <b>relay,</b> proxy, spammer-owned host, etc. For details see RFC 5782.|$|E
50|$|Many MTAs used {{to accept}} {{messages}} for any recipient on the Internet {{and do their}} best to deliver them. Such MTAs are called <b>open</b> mail <b>relays.</b> This was very important {{in the early days of}} the Internet when network connections were unreliable. However, this mechanism proved to be exploitable by originators of unsolicited bulk email and as a consequence <b>open</b> mail <b>relays</b> have become rare, and many MTAs do not accept messages from <b>open</b> mail <b>relays.</b>|$|R
50|$|Spammers {{frequently}} {{seek out}} and make use of vulnerable third-party systems such as <b>open</b> mail <b>relays</b> and <b>open</b> proxy servers. SMTP forwards mail from one server to anotherâ€”mail servers that ISPs run commonly require some form of authentication {{to ensure that the}} user is a customer of that ISP. <b>Open</b> <b>relays,</b> however, do not properly check who is using the mail server and pass all mail to the destination address, making it harder to track down spammers.|$|R
50|$|This trend {{reduced the}} {{percentage}} of mail senders that were <b>open</b> <b>relays</b> from over 90% down to well under 1% over several years. This led to spammers adopting other techniques, {{such as the use}} of botnets of zombie computers to send spam.|$|R
50|$|Non-commercial whitelists are {{operated}} by various non-profit organisations, ISPs and others interested in blocking spam. Rather than paying fees the sender must pass {{a series of}} tests; for example, his email server must not be an <b>open</b> <b>relay</b> and have a static IP address. The operator of the whitelist may remove a server from the list if complaints are received.|$|E
50|$|John Gilmore {{and other}} <b>open</b> <b>relay</b> proponents declare {{that they do}} not support spam and spamming, but see bigger threat in {{attempts}} to limit web capabilities that may block evolution of the new, next generation technologies. They compare the network communication restrictions with restrictions that some phone companies tried to place on their lines in the past, preventing transferring of computer data rather than speech.|$|E
50|$|At the 1925 Ontario Ladies Track and Field championships, in {{a single}} day performance, Rosenfeld placed first in discus, shot put, 220 yd dash, low hurdles, and long jump, and placed second in the javelin and 100 yd dash. In the mid-1920s, she held {{national}} records in the 440 yd <b>open</b> <b>relay</b> with a CNE relay team, {{as well as in the}} standing broad jump, discus, javelin, and shot put.|$|E
