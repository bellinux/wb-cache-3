500|$|The {{kindergarten}} {{reading program}} {{was the first}} step in the Avery Coonley School's transition to a new focus on the education of the gifted, which coincided with a growing public awareness of the needs <b>of</b> <b>gifted</b> <b>children</b> in the late 1960s. The increasing focus on gifted education was symbolized by the 1972 Marland Report to the United States Congress, which was the first acknowledgment of the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>gifted</b> <b>children</b> and their specific educational needs. The report found that [...] "gifted children are, in fact, deprived and can suffer psychological damage and permanent impairment of their abilities to function well which is equal to or greater than the similar deprivation suffered by any other population with special needs". The report highlighted the necessity for educational services for the gifted, and the near total lack of such programs in the public schools at the time. Malach believed that the educational philosophy of Avery Coonley was well aligned with the most important objectives of a gifted program, namely, [...] "the stimulation of individual interests... the development of student initiative, the development of self-acceptance, concept development, and recognition of the early ability to undertake complex learning tasks." ...|$|E

2500|$|Alfred Binet {{published}} Mental Fatigue in 1898, {{in which}} he attempted to apply the experimental method to educational psychology. [...] In this experimental method he advocated for two types of experiments, experiments done in the lab and experiments done in the classroom. [...] In 1904 he was appointed the Minister of Public Education. This is {{when he began to}} look for a way to distinguish children with developmental disabilities. Binet strongly supported special education programs because he believed that [...] "abnormality" [...] could be cured. [...] The Binet-Simon test was the first intelligence test and was the first to distinguish between [...] "normal children" [...] and those with developmental disabilities. [...] Binet believed {{that it was important to}} study individual differences between age groups and children of the same age. He also believed that it was important for teachers to take into account individual students strengths and also the needs of the classroom as a whole when teaching and creating a good learning environment. He also believed that it was important to train teachers in observation so that they would be able to see individual differences among children and adjust the curriculum to the students. Binet also emphasized that practice of material was important. [...] In 1916 Lewis Terman revised the Binet-Simon so that the average score was always 100. The test became known as the Stanford-Binet and was one of the most widely used tests of intelligence. [...] Terman, unlike Binet, was interested in using intelligence test to identify gifted children who had high intelligence. In his longitudinal study <b>of</b> <b>gifted</b> <b>children,</b> who became known as the Termites, Terman found that gifted children become gifted adults.|$|E
