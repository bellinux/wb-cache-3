Night Shyamalan leads you into a {{fascinating}} labyrinth, an alternative universe that lurks right under <b>our</b> <b>noses.</b> In this case, it's the mythological world and, in these modern times, the secret design to that labyrinth, the key to the path, is contained in comic books." ...|$|E
500|$|Even some staunch traditionalists {{from both}} the urban and rural folk music {{communities}} had an affinity for the Kingstons' polished commercial versions of older songs. In her memoir And A Voice To Sing With, singer and activist Joan Baez recalled that [...] "Traveling across the country {{with my mother and}} sisters, we heard the commercial songs of the budding folk boom for the first time, the Kingston Trio's 'Tom Dooley' and 'Scotch and Soda.' Before I turned into a snob and learned to look down upon all commercial folk music as bastardized and unholy, I loved the Kingston Trio. When I became one of the leading practitioners of 'pure folk,' I still loved them..." [...] Arthel [...] "Doc" [...] Watson of North Carolina, {{one of the most respected}} and influential musicians performing traditional music, remarked, [...] "I’ll tell you who pointed all <b>our</b> <b>noses</b> in the right direction, even the traditional performers. They got us interested in trying to put the good stuff out there—the Kingston Trio. They got me interested in it!" ...|$|E
500|$|Dean-Charles Chapman, who portrayed King Tommen Baratheon, {{spoke about}} filming his death scene, saying [...] "I was jumping onto a crash mat. Height-wise, I think if I was {{standing}} on the floor, it was up to my chest. But the crash mat was pretty thick. I must have done that about 50 times. My face was pretty bruised up. My face took it a little bit." [...] Eugene Simon, who portrayed Lancel Lannister, also spoke about his death scene revealing about his discussions with Sapochnik, [...] "the note was when Lancel was dragging his body, {{there was a sense of}} someone who is trying to put aside their pain of being stabbed and being paralyzed as much as possible in order to try to defend what little hope there is left of trying to save the sept and also to save their life. It really only comes down to the very last few nanoseconds of footage that you realize the cause is lost." [...] Simon also stated about the filming of Jonathan Pryce's, who portrays the High Sparrow, final scene, [...] "we had a very big nice round of applause when that took place. I remember that scene very well; we had 200 or so supporting actors in there, all of whom were so committed. They stayed there all day and did wonderful reactions to all the really intense bits. When the first part of the bomb goes off, all of them really, really performed that there was a full-on nuclear explosion going on underneath them." [...] He continued, [...] "We had a big round of applause and celebration after that scene was done because I think we all knew it was going to be pretty monumentous. We said goodbye to countless Tyrells, Kevan Lannister my father, the High Sparrow and dozens of other. It was a pretty extraordinary day." [...] In regards to the non-verbal exchange between Jaime and Cersei Lannister when she is sitting on the Iron Throne, Sapochnik stated [...] "I thought that non-verbal exchange was a very interesting moment but it wasn't clear from the script what exactly Benioff and Weiss wanted. So we just tried a few things, following <b>our</b> <b>noses,</b> drawing from what we knew about these characters and what you see was one of the versions we shot. Interestingly in the edit I still couldn't find a version I felt worked so I actually dropped the moment entirely out of my cut but David and Dan reinstated and to great effect. In fact, I can't really remember the sequence without it anymore. I think he's saying 'don't' and she's saying 'too late.'" [...] He continued [...] "The wonderful thing about filmmaking is you make and remake your film or episode a number of times over the duration of its existence. Firstly in the script stage, second is in prep when you plan how you're going to execute it. Third is in production when you actually get there and have to change everything and finally, in the edit, when you realize what you thought something meant means something totally different when put before or after another juxtaposing or complimentary image." ...|$|E

Mothers can recognize their babies by smell, and newborns also recognize their mothers in the same way before the development of other senses. It is also the most mysterious sense among all, but people are often unaware of what <b>our</b> <b>nose</b> tells us. Although <b>our</b> <b>nose</b> does not work as precise as other animals, it is still possible to utilize our sense of smell for gathering information of our surrounding and registering memorable events. On the other hand, the scent of a place can be intentionally organized for the purpose of enhancing the existing establishment...|$|R

50|$|We use <b>our</b> <b>nose</b> {{and throat}} as a {{regenerative}} heat exchanger when we breathe. The cooler air coming in is warmed, so that it reaches the lungs as warm air.

Some animals, including humans, have curled sheets of bone inside the nose called nasal turbinates to increase the surface area for heat exchange.|$|R
