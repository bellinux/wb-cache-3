5|$|Unbeknownst to the band, their fanbase was {{connecting}} {{and growing}} on the internet, which was helping to boost the reputation and sales of Pinkerton. When it was released, Pinkerton was considered a critical and commercial failure; however, {{in the years following}} the release of the album, it would gain a much more positive reputation due to word-of-mouth <b>on</b> <b>message</b> boards and various web pages. This expanding internet activity would later {{set the stage for the}} band's 2001 comeback. Renewed interaction between band members took place when Weezer was offered a lucrative offer to perform in Japan in August 2000 for the Summer Sonic Festival. Rehearsals for the show reinvigorated the band into talking about making a new album. The band returned to performing in June 2000, playing low-key shows around Los Angeles under the pseudonym Goat Punishment, ensuring that Weezer would only perform for longtime fans who would recognize the name.|$|E

25|$|In {{computer}} science, communicating {{sequential processes}} (CSP) is a formal language for describing patterns of interaction in concurrent systems. It {{is a member}} of the family of mathematical theories of concurrency known as process algebras, or process calculi, based <b>on</b> <b>message</b> passing via channels. CSP was highly influential in the design of the occam programming language, and also influenced the design of programming languages such as Limbo, RaftLib, Go, Crystal, and Clojure's core.async.|$|E

25|$|Before {{the modern}} era, {{cryptography}} focused <b>on</b> <b>message</b> confidentiality (i.e., encryption)—conversion of messages from a comprehensible form into an incomprehensible one {{and back again}} at the other end, rendering it unreadable by interceptors or eavesdroppers without secret knowledge (namely the key needed for decryption of that message). Encryption attempted to ensure secrecy in communications, {{such as those of}} spies, military leaders, and diplomats. In recent decades, the field has expanded beyond confidentiality concerns to include techniques for message integrity checking, sender/receiver identity authentication, digital signatures, interactive proofs and secure computation, among others.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMulticast group {{communication}} protocols are used extensively in fault-tolerant distributed systems. For many such protocols, the acknowledgments for individual messages define a causal order <b>on</b> <b>messages.</b> Maintaining {{the consistency of}} information, replicated on several processors to protect it against faults, is greatly simplified by a total order <b>on</b> <b>messages.</b> We present algorithms that incrementally convert a causal order <b>on</b> <b>messages</b> into a total order and that tolerate both crash and Byzantine process faults. Varying compromises between latency to message ordering and resilience to faults yield four distinct algorithms. All of these algorithms use a multistage voting strategy to achieve agreement on the total order and exploit the random structure of the causal order to ensure probabilistic termination...|$|R
25|$|Arguably, {{concurrent}} {{logic programming}} is based <b>on</b> <b>message</b> passing and consequently {{is subject to}} the same indeterminacy as other concurrent message-passing systems, such as Actors (see Indeterminacy in concurrent computation). Carl Hewitt has argued that, concurrent logic programming is not based on logic in his sense that computational steps cannot be logically deduced. However, in concurrent logic programming, any result of a terminating computation is a logical consequence of the program, and any partial result of a partial computation is a logical consequence of the program and the residual goal (process network). Consequently, the indeterminacy of computations implies that not all logical consequences of the program can be deduced.|$|E

500|$|Harrison's {{health was}} a minor {{campaign}} issue; it was presented by the Whigs as robust, and by Democrats as decrepit. The campaign released a letter from his doctor, testifying to his good health; this was a presidential election first. Another testament to Harrison's health was his speeches: he gave 24 addresses between June and October, all in Ohio and lasting up to three hours; Van Buren did not give any. Harrison {{did not have the}} campaign trail to himself; Vice President Johnson told Van Buren that the President should [...] "go out among the voters as I intended doing". Democrats tried to paint Johnson as the true hero of the Battle of the Thames, but the Vice President refused to criticize Harrison's conduct in battle. Nevertheless, Johnson spoke with such enthusiasm that he may have set off a riot in Cleveland, and was followed onto the trail late in the campaign by John Tyler, who had difficulty staying <b>on</b> <b>message</b> and resorted to telling questioners, [...] "I am in favor of what General Harrison and Mr. Clay are in favor of." ...|$|E

From the {{suggestions}} of fans <b>on</b> <b>message</b> boards and newsgroups, reviews of Baldur's Gate, and internal suggestions, {{a list of}} constructive criticism was compiled; from this list, a slightly shorter one of features {{to be added to}} the game was made. Some of the items on this list were: support for higher resolutions, such as 800 by 600 pixels and above; 3D support; non-pausing dialogue in multiplayer; drop off panels in the interface; character kits; dual-wielding of weapons; a streamlined journal and annotable map; deathmatch; and inclusion of famous AD monsters such as the dragon. Not many features had to be cut, and they kept as many as they could. Because of the engine's mature state of development, most features were fairly easy to add. Ben Smedstad, the producer of the game, said, [...] "The engine was up and running since day one, which is a huge morale booster. When a monster is complete, we put it into the 'override' directory and it appears in the game! This is a huge change from working on the original." [...] Late in the project, deathmatch was removed, while non-pausing dialogue, which proved [...] "the most problematic feature", was removed early on before being reintroduced in early 2000.|$|E
