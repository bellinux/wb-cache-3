In this paper, an emergy-based method is conducted to measure the resources input of Chinese industry from 1997 to 2006. Resources inflows including fossil fuels, mineral resources, agricultural products, and other imported materials are accounted, based on which related indicators including resources intensity, industrial output, and environmental emissions are investigated. Results show a steady upward trend for the total resources input of Chinese industry during the past decade. The total resources input amounted to 1. 53 × 1025 sej in 2006, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>non-renewable</b> one accounted for 70. 65 % owing to the dominating input of fossil fuels and nonmetal minerals. Resources intensity measured by the ratio of resources input to industrial value added declined gradually during 1997 – 2002, but {{the rapid expansion of}} resource–intensive sub–sectors resulted in a reverse trend since 2003. The current resources use pattern of Chinese industry is characterized by increasing input of non-renewable resources, excessive expansion of resource–intensive production, and tremendous challenge from environmental pressure...|$|E
40|$|Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tool {{has been}} applied to {{evaluate}} environmental impacts through the whole building life cycle. LCA has been carried out in accordance to the international standard of ISO 14040 and ISO 14044. As a reference, an application of LCA has been made to a Catalan house located in Barcelona, Spain with a projected 50 years life span. In this work, construction, use (operation and maintenance) and end-of-life phases have been considered. The operational energy consumed during the dwelling period was modeled using a mix of electrical power for electrical appliances, illumination, heating and cooling; and using thermal energy from natural gas for domestic hot water and cooking. Result shows that the highest environmental impacts during the dwelling's life cycle took place during the use phase. The total impact of global warming potential was 4. 52 + 01 kgCO(2) -Equiv. m(- 2) a(- 1) of which use phase accounted for 92 % (operation 90 % and maintenance 2 %), construction represented 7 % and end-of-life contributed less than 1 %. Regarding the operation phase, cooling had the highest environmental burden with 33 %, heating represented 9 %, followed by illumination 26 % and electrical appliances 19 %. The other two household activities accounted for less than 12 % (domestic hot water 9 % and cooking 4 %) of total phase. During the construction phase, the production of building materials represented about 97 %, transport to the job site 2 % and waste management 1 % of total phase. The total primary energy demand was 5. 26 E+ 01 MJ m(- 2) a(- 1) (gross calorific value) <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>non-renewable</b> primary energy demand represents 78 % and renewable energy demand 22 %. In summary, data for a Catalan home has been provided to evaluate environmental impacts using LCA tool. Data have been modelled into the Gabi software system.

In dark fermentation, carbohydrates are converted to hydrogen by fermentative microorganisms including strict anaerobe and facultative anaerobe bacteria. A theoretical maximum of 4 mol H2/mol glucose can be produced and, besides hydrogen, sugars are converted to volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohols as by-products during this process. Photo fermentative bacteria are able to generate hydrogen from VFAs. Hence, metabolites formed in dark fermentation can be used as feedstock in photo fermentation to enhance the overall yield of hydrogen.|$|R

The paper also highlights the need to switch over from the utilization <b>of</b> artificial fibres, <b>which</b> are <b>non-renewable</b> and fossil fuel products, to environmental beneficial materials like green fibres. The utilization of plant products like sisal and jute fibres and their composites in various structural engineering applications addresses the issues of sustainability and renewability with constructional materials. The paper describes a suitable mechanical treatment method like high temperature conditioning, which aids us in further improving the properties of these woven natural materials like sisal and jute for composite fabrication and utilization. Heat treated natural fibres of woven sisal and jute were utilized for confining concrete cylinders similar to CFRP and GFRP confinement and their confinement characteristics were obtained and compared. All the cylinders were subjected to monotonic axial compressive loads, so as to evaluate the effect of confinement on the axial load carrying capacity and all their failure modes were discussed thoroughly. The results indicated superior performance by sisal FRP as well as jute FRP confined cylinders as compared to controlled or unconfined cylinders, also sisal FRP wrapped cylinders displayed ultimate axial load of comparable magnitude to CFRP confinement. Natural FRP confinement displayed superior confinement modulus and confinement strength, also the ultimate axial load of concrete cylinders confined with natural FRPs underwent 66 % enhancement by sisal FRP and 48 % enhancement by jute FRP, in comparison with controlled or unconfined cylinders. Enhancement in axial load carrying capacity was 83 % with CFRP confinement and 180 % with GFRP confinement.

The increasing demands of energy are consumed by using fossil fuels <b>which</b> are <b>non-renewable</b> {{and will be}} depleted within 150 years from now if this growth rate stays but if this rate increases further the depleting time will decrease from the estimated one. Because of low reservation of crude oil, Bangladesh has to import oils from other countries, these costs a lot. About 95 % of these demands can be meted through biodiesel. Biodiesel prepared from both edible and non-edible oils. After meeting demands of edible oil of the country {{it is impossible to}} produce biodiesel from edible oils. But it is possible to meet the biodiesel demand of the country almost 100 % through non-edible oil derived biodiesel. Arable lands of Bangladesh can’t be used for the growing purposes of non-edible oil seeds, but if rail and road sides are used {{there is no need for}} extra lands. After surveying lands for this purpose it seems that Bangladesh can get a total amount of 47750 Km of road and rail side areas for the cultivation of non-edible seeds. Among these forest seeds Nageswar, Pitraj, Sultana champa Ponyal, Rata, Oil palm, Chaulmoogra, Bakul, Kusum, jaina have sufficient oil content along with plenty of growth in Bangladesh. Cultivating these seeds 1100000 tones of biodiesel can be produced on the basis of their oil content and yield. Which decreases the amount of imported crude oil as well as meets the oil demand of the country, thus Bangladesh can be able to save about $ 6 billion per year means a great economic savings that can be used for the development of the country...|$|R
40|$|Limitations <b>of</b> diesel <b>which</b> is a <b>non-renewable</b> energy sources, {{requires}} {{alternative fuels}} to renewable and environmentally friendly, for example is biodiesel. The main reaction is {{the production of}} biodiesel esterification and transesterification, but these conventional reactions are slow, {{requires a lot of}} alcohol and a catalyst, the reaction has not been perfect, and the products do not meet SNI and ASTM standards. In this research, mixing castor oil and palm oil as biodiesel feedstock, but it aims to obtain the optimum conditions for the blending ratio variable mass castor and palm oil, the amount of catalyst to oil, and the mole ratio of methanol-oil with helped by ultrasonic waves. The resulting biodiesel product is expected to meet SNI and ASTM standards. The main tool used is the ultrasonic cleaner. Variable that is the ratio of the mass of castor oil and palm 1 : 1, 2 : 1, and 3 : 1, the amount of catalyst KOH 1 %, 1. 5 %, and 2 % by mass of oil, and methanol-oil mole ratio 3 : 1, 6 : 1, and 9 : 1. The results obtained highest conversion achieved in the mass ratio 2 : 1 castor oil and palm oil, catalyst 1. 5 % by mass of oil, and the mole ratio of 6 : 1 with a mixture of methanol-conversion 95. 341 % where diesel fuel product meets SNI and ASTM standards...|$|R
40|$|International audienceInorganic {{phosphate}} (Pi) {{and zinc}} (Zn) are two essential nutrients for plant growth. In soils, these two minerals are either present in low amounts or are poorly available to plants. Consequently, worldwide agriculture has {{become dependent on}} external sources of Pi and Zn fertilizers to increase crop yields. However, this strategy is neither economically nor ecologically sustainable in the long term, particularly for Pi, <b>which</b> is a <b>non-renewable</b> resource. To date, research has emphasized the analysis of mineral nutrition considering each nutrient individually, and showed that Pi and Zn homeostasis is highly regulated in a complex process. Interestingly, numerous observations point to an unexpected interconnection between the homeostasis of the two nutrients. Nevertheless, despite their fundamental importance, the molecular bases and biological significance of these interactions remain largely unknown. Such interconnections can account for shortcomings of current agronomic models that typically focus on improving the assimilation of individual elements. Here, current knowledge on the regulation of the transport and signalling of Pi and Zn individually is reviewed, and then insights are provided on the recent progress made towards {{a better understanding of}} the Zn-Pi homeostasis interaction in plants...|$|R
