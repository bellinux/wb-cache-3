500|$|In January 2010, Republican Governor Linda Lingle {{publicly}} {{recommended that}} the city alter plans for the rail line after news reports on FTA documents where the federal agency raised issues over declining tax revenues {{in connection with a}} global economic recession, and commissioned a study by the state to review the project's finances in March. [...] The state financial study, publicly released on December 2, 2010, indicated that the project would likely experience a $1.7billion overrun above the $5.3billion projected cost, and that collections from the General Excise Tax would be 30% below forecasts. [...] Then Mayor Peter Carlisle (Democrat) dismissed the study as [...] "damaged goods," [...] and [...] "a pre-determined anti-rail rant." [...] He also pointed to several conclusions as [...] "erroneous" [...] and [...] "inaccurate" [...] before concluding that [...] "spending a third of a million dollars for this shoddy, biased analysis is an appalling waste of <b>our</b> <b>tax</b> dollars." [...] Lingle's Democratic successor, Neil Abercrombie, publicly stated that the financial analysis would not affect his decision to approve or disapprove of the project, saying that the state's responsibility is limited to the environmental review process, and that decisions regarding the project's finances belong to the city and the FTA. [...] Governor Abercrombie subsequently approved the project's final environmental impact statement on December 16, 2010. [...] The Honolulu City Council held a hearing on January 12, 2011 about the state's financial review, but the hearing was not attended by any state officials, who had been invited to testify.|$|E

60|$|Property in Great Britain is secure. It {{would be}} a great mistake to suppose that that {{security}} depends upon the House of Lords. If the security of property in a powerful nation like our own were dependent upon the action or inaction of 500 or 600 persons, that security would long ago have been swept away. The security of property depends upon its wide diffusion among great numbers and all classes of the population, and it becomes more secure year by year because it is gradually being more widely distributed. The vital processes of civilisation require, and the combined interests of millions guarantee, the security of property. A society in which property was insecure would speedily degenerate into barbarism; a society in which property was absolutely secure, irrespective of all conceptions of justice in regard to the manner of its acquisition, would degenerate, not to barbarism, but death. No one claims that a Government should from time to time, according to its conceptions of justice, attempt fundamentally to recast the bases on which property is erected. The process must be a gradual one; must be a social and a moral process, working steadily in the mind and {{in the body of the}} community; but we contend, when new burdens have to be apportioned, when new revenues have to be procured, when the necessary upkeep of the State requires further taxes to be imposed--we contend that, in distributing the new burdens, a Government should have regard first of all to ability to pay and, secondly, that they should have regard to some extent, and so far as is practicable, to the means and the process by which different forms of wealth have been acquired; and that they should make a sensible difference between wealth which is the fruit of productive enterprise and industry or of individual skill, and wealth which represents the capture by individuals of socially created values. We say that ought to be taken into consideration. We are taking it into consideration now by the difference we have made in the income-tax between earned and unearned incomes, by the difference we make between the taxation which is imposed upon a fortune which a man makes himself and the fortune which he obtains from a relative or a stranger. We are taking it into consideration in <b>our</b> <b>tax</b> on mining royalties, in our licence duties and in our taxes on the unearned increment in land. The State, we contend, has a special claim upon the monopoly value of the liquor licence, which the State itself has created, and which the State itself maintains from year to year by its sole authority. If that claim has not previously been made good, that is only because the liquor interest have had the power, by using one branch of the Legislature, to keep the nation out of its rights. All the more reason to make our claim good now.|$|E
