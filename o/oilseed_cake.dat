40|$|In {{the recent}} years, new {{perspectives}} for oilseed crops are open as renewable and valuable feedstocks for biorefinery processes. In fact, {{these kind of}} crops are particularly suitable for obtaining, through a cascading use of total biomass, highest added-value products, such as bio-based products and industrial materials (pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, fine chemicals, cosmetics, agrochemicals, biomaterials), over bioenergy. In particular, <b>oilseed</b> <b>cakes,</b> deriving from plant oil extraction, represent interesting co-products. They are usually used as animal feed, due to their high protein and energy contents. The nutritional values of <b>oilseed</b> <b>cakes</b> as animal feed and the feed performance has been extensively studied. On the other hand, the <b>oilseed</b> <b>cakes</b> contain bioactive substances, such as phenolic acids, flavonoids, lignans and other antioxidant compounds, {{which could be used}} as food additive, supplement or cosmeceutical additive for the protection of foods and human health. However, there are only few reports about their phytochemical characteristics. In view of a cascading approach of biomass utilization, the extraction of these chemicals can be considered in order to increase the added value of these co-products. In the present study, four different oilseed crops are considered: camelina (Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz., var. Italia), linseed (Linum usitatissimum L., var. Sideral and Buenos Aires), safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L., var. Pieve and Montola 2000) and crambe (Crambe abyssinica L., var. Mario 2000). They were cultivated in open field conditions, during two consecutive years (2014 and 2015), in two environments of central and northern Italy (Pisa and Bologna). After the agronomical evaluation (seed yield, harvest index, oil and protein content), the cakes, obtained from oil extraction, were chemically characterized. The content of total phenolic compounds (by the Folin-Ciocalteau assay), total flavonoids (by the aluminum-chloride method), and lignan quality profile (by HPLC-PDA/UV-ESI-MS/MS) were assessed. At the same time, the radical-scavenging activity was investigated by the DPPH method. The phytochemical characterization of the obtained seed cakes showed that these co-products contained considerable amounts of bioactive substances, varying depending on the oilseed crops. In particular, camelina seed cake showed the highest content of polyphenols and flavonoids, while safflower and linseed exhibited the strongest radical-scavenging activity. For linseed cake, the profile of lignans showed the presence of secoisolariciresinol-diglucoside as the main compound of this interesting class of chemicals. In conclusion, this study suggests that <b>oilseed</b> <b>cakes</b> from the investigated crops, due to their interesting phytochemicals and bioactive values, would be valuable candidates as functional foods and natural dietary supplements. These results, together with the good agronomic performance in terms of crop seed yield and oil content, suggest that these novel oilseed crops can be successfully introduced into the cereal based cropping systems of the tested environmental conditions, with potential agro-environmental and economic benefits...|$|R

For various reasons, the areas cultivating castor beans were substantially reduced, {{and it is now}} a distant third behind the principal producers, India and China. Castor oil is a very strategic industrial raw material, but its production is complicated by the presence of toxic substances and allergens in the beans and thus in the seed cake by-product of oil extraction. Castor plants are suitable for semiarid zones and for small producers. The European Union, especially France, has successfully attempted cultivation of this plant but for the reasons above-mentioned decided to limit itself to importing castor oil. As part of a scientific agreement, Embrapa (through Labex) and Cirad (through its fat and oil research team) considered ways of contributing to the resumption of castor bean production in Brazil. The following possibilities are being or can be explored: a new concept for oil extraction (using acetone as the solvent) with the simultaneous production of an <b>oilseed</b> <b>cake</b> with reduced or no allergenic problems; lipase production from this biomass as well as the production of high value biomolecules.

Nitrogen input to the system was from various feed materials, including 6. 8 Mt (38 % of total) from roughage, 4. 4 Mt (24 %) from byproducts, 2. 3 Mt (13 %) from cereal grains, and 1. 6 Mt (9 %) each from crop residues and <b>oilseed</b> <b>cakes,</b> with the remaining N (16 %) obtained from other feedstuffs. Nitrogen outputs from the system included edible animal products (2. 4 t, 13 % of total), nonedible animal parts (e. g., bones, skins) (3. 8 Mt, 21 %), and excreta (12 Mt, 66 %). At the national level, the excreta would average 28 Mg (as excreted) and 90 kg N ha(- 1) of cropland. However, at the provincial level, it varied from 1 Mg ha(- 1) (5 kg N ha(- 1)) in Qinghai to 97 Mg ha(- 1) (243 kg N ha(- 1)) in Sichuan. In regions with excreta in the intermediate rate (e. g., Hebei Province, 115 kg N ha(- 1)) or high rare (e. g., Sichuan Province, 243 kg N ha(- 1)), animal manure contributes significantly to nutrients polluting groundwater and/or surface waters. It is crucial for China to develop and implement proper management practices to maximum the beneficial use of the 12 Mt excreta N while minimizing its environmental footprint...|$|R
40|$|The {{valorization}} of Brassica oilseed crops, {{starting from}} the agronomical phase up to the exploitation of the derived products, was studied. Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz applications in biorefineries is of deep interest, given the high added value of its oil and <b>oilseed</b> <b>cake</b> residue. Camelina was evaluated {{as a case study}} for the cultivation in the Po valley. In such conditions, camelina has shown to be potentially well adaptable and had a positive impact on the yields of the subsequent crop. Thus, studies on camelina management and its impact on soil properties deserve more attention. Novel Brassica defatted seed meals (DSMs), containing different glucosinolates, were applied in the control of the southern root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne incognita (Kofoid & White Chitwood) in controlled glasshouse conditions. Among different Brassica DSMs, the best results in the reduction of M. incognita infestation were achieved by Eruca sativa, Barbarea verna and Brassica nigra DSMs. These first results open new perspectives for innovative bioactive molecules for biofumigation applied in cropping systems where nematode suppression is critical. Finally, the effect of Brassica DSMs, applied in formulations with and without crude glycerin, on seed germination inhibition was evaluated. The most effective formulations were applied in in vitro and glasshouse trials to evaluate the germination inhibition of black-grass (Alopecurus myosuriodes Huds.). Both in vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed the effectiveness of Brassica DSMs formulated with glycerin, especially B. nigra, in germination inhibition. Among different advantages, the proposed formulations for weed control are completely bio-based, organic farming friendly, present a good fertilizing properties and a combined effect both on weeds and on soil borne pests and diseases...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{reserves}} {{of fuel and}} energy resources saving {{in the production of}} oil extraction is the improvement of equipment energy-intensive modes, and forepress in particular. Therefore the authors used an efficient energy saving method, based on the optimi-zation of the oilseeds pressing in the forepress on technical and economic indicator. Specific heat and energy losses were used as the optimi-zation criterion. We propose an automatic optimization of the two-stage pressing, including the measuring of oil content in the seeds of the original material and expeller oilcake, initial product temperature, flow rate of the initial product and oil output in the first stage pressing in forepress and the second stage extracting in the spin expeller. Additionally, the steam is fed in the tank roaster, mean-integral product temperature in the roaster and after it is measured, steam flow rate and power consumption of regulated forepress drive is determined. From the measured oil content values of the starting material and expeller <b>oilseed</b> <b>cake</b> the current value of their ratio is determined. Depending on it the frequency of screw rotation is set in forepress by influencing the power of forepress regulated drive with the correction of ratio of oil content on the current pressure in the press nip. According to the temperature of the initial product the steam flow with the correction by value of mean-integral temperature in the tank roaster is determined. When the pressure reaches its maximum value the speed of the fore-press screw is reduced, and the heating temperature of the product in the area of tank roaster is stabilized by changing the steam flow in it with the correction of the current value of the temperature of the starting material...|$|E
40|$|Inadequate {{nutrition}} is {{the main}} cause of low productivity of livestock in sub-Saharan Africa. The primary feed resources include fodder trees, natural pastures and crop residues. This paper presents results from studies conducted at ILRI in evaluations of these resources. The effect of supplementing teff straw with lablab or cowpea in cattle on microbial protein supply was evaluated using urinary purine derivatives. There was no effect of type of supplement but the level of supplementation significantly improved microbial protein supply. Similarly, supplementing maize stover with <b>oilseed</b> <b>cake</b> increased total microbial protein flow in sheep. Teff straw supplemented with Sesbania sesban increased dry matter degradation and liquid passage rates. Degradation of Sesbania, Leucaena, Chamaecytisus and Vernonia foliage was also evaluated. Sesbania was degraded rapidly and Vernonia slowly. The effects of anti-nutrient extracts from Vernonia amygdalina, Chamaecytisus palmensis, Sesbania sesban and Acacia angustissima were tested on pure cultures of cellulolytic rumen microbes and A. angustissima prolonged the lag phase. A angustissima killed sheep and Tephrosia caused massive rumen statis. Studies conducted in semi-arid West Africa indicated that the microbial digestive activity, as measured by the disappearance in sacco of a standard forage, varies both seasonally and across animal species. Genetic variation in feeding value of crop residues, forage legumes and fodder trees were assessed. The variation among varieties of sorghum and pearl millet were relatively small and inconsistent across years. Relatively larger differences were observed in forage legumes. Preliminary results suggest possibilities for identifying geographical areas that produce better quality fodder trees. Future work should include the biochemical basis of the interactions between rumen microbes and the chemicals contained in fodder trees, and the seasonal variations of microbial populations in various ruminants across agro-ecological zones...|$|E
40|$|Biorefinery {{of rubber}} tree side streams could add {{economic}} value and income for farmers, who already grow the trees for latex production. The {{objective of this}} research was to design a process for the recovery of proteinaceous fractions from rubber tree. The aimed applications were expected to be suitable for local use, particularly in Indonesia, being one of the world’s largest rubber producers. Rubber seed was selected as a model biomass based on its availability (21 - 144 kg-protein/ha) and its oil content that enables the combination of protein and biodiesel productions within a biorefinery framework. Experimental works were focused on three parts: separation of protein and oil from rubber seed kernel, enzymatic hydrolysis of rubber seed protein into amino acids, and separation of amino acids from hydrolysate. Using alkaline extraction, up to 80 % protein from the total original amount of protein in the kernel could be recovered in the extract, comparable to protein recoveries from other <b>oilseeds</b> and <b>oilseed</b> <b>cakes.</b> Seed type and pre-treatment had the most influence on protein recovery. Following protein extraction, the extracted proteins were recovered via isoelectric precipitation, resulting in rubber seed protein concentrate that can be used as such or can be processed further. Different protease combinations were used to hydrolyse rubber seed protein concentrate. After 24 h hydrolysis of rubber seed protein, up to 53 % degree of hydrolysis and 35 % protein recovery as free amino acids could be achieved. Combination of Pronase + Peptidase R resulted in the highest recovery and concentration of hydrophobic amino acids (phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, tyrosine, tryptophan, valine, methionine, and proline) in the hydrolysate. Some hydrophobic amino acids are essential in human and farm animal diets, therefore they can potentially be applied as a group in food and feed. Ethanol was used as an anti-solvent for selective precipitation of amino acids. Ethanol was able to selectively increase the hydrophobic amino acid fraction in rubber seed protein hydrolysate from 59 % (mol/mol) in the starting material to 76 % in the supernatant. Leucine and valine contributed most to this increase. The results of this study show that rubber seed proteins can be applied locally as animal feed or in industries for technical applications...|$|R
50|$|No {{matter the}} design, the same end {{products}} are {{obtained from the}} operation of an oilseed press. After the oil {{is removed from the}} oilseed, an <b>oilseed</b> meal or <b>cake</b> remains. This valuable by-product is especially rich in protein. Aside from safflower and sunflower meal, most oilseed meals contain around 40% crude protein. Although this allows most oilseed meals to be readily applied as protein supplements for ruminants such as cattle, the truth is that many of these meals have undesirable amino acid ratios or exhibit poor digestibility limits their use in swine and poultry diets.|$|R
40|$|Abstract This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the production of methane, carbon dioxide, and volatile fatty acids and changes in ruminal pH in vitro with <b>oilseed</b> press <b>cakes</b> inclusion, such as, cottonseed, sunflower, castor bean, moringa and jatropha at four different levels (0, 30, 50 and 70 %) in replacement to the sugarcane in ruminant feeding using semi-automated in vitro technique. The byproduct that produced less CO 2 was cottonseed cake (p = 0. 0059). The cakes that produced {{the least amount of}} CH 4 were moringa at 70 % (p < 0. 05) and cottonseed at 70 % levels (p < 0. 0001). The cakes that had the highest increases in VFAs were cottonseed and castor (p < 0. 0001). Additionally, greater pH was moringa at 70 % and cottonseed at 50 % levels (p < 0. 0001). The greater acetate concentration was 70 % cottonseed cake, propionate concentration with 30 % cottonseed and butyrate concentration with 50 % moringa in sugarcane replace. At the 70 % level, the moringa cake displayed the highest decreases in methane production and reduction in energy loss. At the 50 % substitution level, the cottonseed cake is the most suitable replacement for sugarcane {{in order to reduce the}} production of greenhouse gases. 201...|$|R
