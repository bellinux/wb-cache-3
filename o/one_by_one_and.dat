Each time he does so, the pot takes on the {{symptoms}} of the ones who ask for help, it starts disturbing the son and prevents him from having any peace of mind. This continues until the son finally gives up and provides aid to the town. Upon doing this, the pot's ailments are removed <b>one</b> <b>by</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> the son's ordeal finally ends one day when the slipper he received from his father falls out of the pot; he puts the slipper on the pot's foot and the two walk off into the sunset.|$|E
5|$|Ignoring the batteries, Stopford {{ordered his}} {{squadron}} to attack at 09:00 on 24 February, HMS Defiance leading the line. Shortly after the main batteries of Stopford's ships {{of the line}} came into the battle, the French ships were overwhelmed <b>one</b> <b>by</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> shortly after noon all three had been driven ashore with heavy casualties. British histories recount that all three were destroyed, although French histories report that they were salvaged but found to be damaged beyond repair. The fleet under Willaumez was trapped in the anchorage at Basque Roads on 26 February and defeated at the Battle of Basque Roads in April with heavy losses.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, {{the hunting}} {{is done by}} {{a select group of}} fishermen. When a pod of {{dolphins}} has been spotted, they're driven into a bay by the fishermen while banging on metal rods in the water to scare and confuse the dolphins. When the dolphins are in the bay, it is quickly closed off with nets so the dolphins cannot escape. The dolphins are usually not caught and killed immediately, but instead left to calm down over night. The following day, the dolphins are caught <b>one</b> <b>by</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> killed.|$|E

After doing this, it will pick off the berries <b>one</b> <b>by</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> eat them. It uses its partially open bill to probe and move aside debris like leaf litter. It is generally wary and secretive, and selfish when mated. This manifests in warning its partner with threat displays to keep it at a distance. Even so, it has occasionally been seen to openly forage in short grass near thickets and in streams or muddy tracks.|$|E
5|$|Another notable {{king of the}} Anuradhapura Kingdom is Valagamba (103, 89–77 BC), {{also known}} as Vatthagamani Abhaya, who was overthrown by five invaders from South India. He regained his throne after {{defeating}} these invaders <b>one</b> <b>by</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> unified the country again under his rule. Saddha Tissa (137–119 BC), Mahaculi Mahatissa (77–63 BC), Vasabha (67–111), Gajabahu I (114–136), Dhatusena (455–473), Aggabodhi I (571–604) and Aggabodhi II (604–614) were among the rulers who held sway over the entire country after Dutthagamani and Valagamba. Rulers from Kutakanna Tissa (44–22 BC) to Amandagamani (29–19 BC) also managed to keep the whole country {{under the rule of}} the Anuradhapura Kingdom. Other rulers could not maintain their rule over the whole island, and independent regions often existed in Ruhuna and Malayarata (hill country) for limited periods. During the final years of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, rebellions sprang up and the authority of the kings gradually declined. By the time of Mahinda V (982–1017), the last king of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, the rule of the king had become so weak that he could not even properly organize the collection of taxes.|$|E

Imhotep returns to full strength by killing the Americans <b>one</b> <b>by</b> <b>one,</b> <b>and</b> brings the ten plagues back to Egypt. Seeking a way to stop Imhotep, Rick, Evelyn and Jonathan meet Ardeth at a museum. Ardeth hypothesizes that Imhotep wants to resurrect Anck-su-Namun again and plans to do so by sacrificing Evelyn. Evelyn believes that if the Book of the Dead brought Imhotep back to life, the Book of the Living can kill him again, and deduces the book's whereabouts. Imhotep corners the group with an army of slaves. Evelyn agrees to accompany Imhotep if he spares the rest of the group.|$|E

5|$|Villaret, {{believing that}} the {{stronger}} British fleet would destroy his own 12 ships of the line, ordered his force to fall back to the inshore anchorage off Groix, hoping to take shelter in protected coastal waters. Several of his ships were too slow, falling behind so that {{early in the morning}} of 23 June the rearmost ships of his fleet were caught by the British vanguard, overhauled <b>one</b> <b>by</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> brought to battle. Although Villaret fought a determined rearguard action, three French ships were captured, all with very heavy casualties, and the remainder of the French fleet was left scattered across miles of coastline. In this position they were highly vulnerable to continued British attack, but after only a few hours' engagement, concerned that his ships might be wrecked on the rocky coastline, Bridport called off the action and allowed Villaret to regroup inshore and retreat to Lorient.|$|E
5|$|While racing opponents, {{the player}} must {{successfully}} manoeuvre the Jet Ski around various buoys. There {{are two types}} of buoys: red colored, which must be passed on the right side, and yellow buoys, which must be passed on the left side. Each time a buoy is correctly passed, a power arrow in the game's HUD will light, allowing the player's Jet Ski to gain speed. Up to five power arrows can be lit in order to obtain maximum power. Therefore, maintaining this process will allow the player to maintain a high speed. Failure to correctly pass a single buoy will result in the loss of all the player's accumulated power (though the power arrows can be lit again <b>one</b> <b>by</b> <b>one)</b> <b>and</b> missing five buoys {{over the course of a}} race will result in disqualification. Leaving the course area limited by pink buoys for more than five seconds will also result in disqualification.|$|E

25|$|Insertion sort is {{a simple}} sorting {{algorithm}} that is relatively efficient for small lists and mostly sorted lists, and is often used as part of more sophisticated algorithms. It works by taking elements from the list <b>one</b> <b>by</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> inserting them in their correct position into a new sorted list. In arrays, the new list and the remaining elements can share the array's space, but insertion is expensive, requiring shifting all following elements over by one. Shellsort (see below) is a variant of insertion sort that is more efficient for larger lists.|$|E

25|$|After {{about two}} hours, exhaustion, thirst {{and the heat}} of summer took their toll on the Portuguese rowers, {{and many of their}} ships were left behind. Eight of them, the vanguard of the Portuguese fleet, {{attacked}} the small island of Saltés and destroyed the property of the fishermen in the vicinity. Seeing that the Portuguese had fallen into his trap, de Tovar launched his ships against the enemy in compact formation, and easily captured the Portuguese galleys. The rest of the Portuguese fleet approached in disarray <b>one</b> <b>by</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> were captured by the Castilians without difficulty.

25|$|At 11:00am, Decaen came up {{in support}} of Drouet's brigade near the {{southern}} edge of the battlefield. The situation was very fluid, with units blundering into each other in a heavy snowfall. The fresh infusion of French troops finally broke through the opposition. Drouet led his troops north to the highway, where the 8th Line still battled Liechtenstein's cavalry. Spearheaded by the Polish Danube Legion, Decaen turned east to grapple with Riesch. Decaen's men overcame Riesch's small columns <b>one</b> <b>by</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> pushed them back to the heights of Albaching.

25|$|In Vana Parva, the {{circumstances}} behind Kartikeya's birth legend {{do not involve}} Shiva and Parvati. Rather it is deity Agni who goes to a hermitage of seven married Rishis (sages).

According to the legend, Svaha {{takes the form of}} six of the wives, <b>one</b> <b>by</b> <b>one,</b> <b>and</b> sleeps with Agni. She does not take the form of Arundhati, Vasistha's wife, because of Arundhati's extraordinary virtuous powers.

25|$|The {{display on}} a net sounder shows the {{distance}} of the net from the bottom (or the surface), rather than the depth of water as with the echo-sounder's hull-mounted transducer. Fixed to the headline of the net, the footrope can usually be seen which gives an indication of the net performance. Any fish passing into the net can also be seen, allowing fine adjustments to be made to catch the most fish possible. In other fisheries, where the amount of fish in the net is important, catch sensor transducers are mounted at various positions on the cod-end of the net. As the cod-end fills up these catch sensor transducers are triggered <b>one</b> <b>by</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> this information is transmitted acoustically to display monitors on the bridge of the vessel. The skipper can then decide when to haul the net.|$|E
25|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1793 Hood was distracted by the Siege of Toulon, but did sent a {{squadron}} with orders to attack San Fiorenzo. The attack achieved initial success but was driven off by the fortifications at the Torra di Fornali. After the fall of Toulon in December 1793, Hood turned his main attention to Corsica and ordered a joint operation against the town, attacking from the sea and with amphibious landings. Over two weeks the main defences of the town were defeated {{by a series of}} artillery operations which drove the French out of their defences <b>one</b> <b>by</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> destroyed the French shipping in the harbour. On 18 February the French garrison withdrew across the island to Bastia, which was attacked in turn later in the spring. By August 1794, the French had been driven from Corsica, which had become a self-governing part of the British Empire.|$|E
