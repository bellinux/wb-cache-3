40|$|The {{reduction}} of torque ripple {{is the main}} target in research for designing a variable drive system with switched reluctance motors (SRM) for higher torque density and better efficiency. This ripple {{is due to the}} transition of excitation current between the adjacent phases. Precise control of turn-on and turn <b>off</b> <b>angle</b> is required to smooth the torque. In this paper, the effects of selecting the turn-on and turn-off angles are simulated in detail. It is observed that with the extended turn-on and turn <b>off</b> <b>angles,</b> the precise selection of turn-on and turn <b>off</b> <b>angle</b> can alter the shape of the excitation current in the stator coil and its point of overlapping with the adjacent coil. Therefore the transition between different phases can be smoothed out. The impact of this alteration on the excitation current and torque ripple as a function of different parameters of dwell angle is studied in detail in this paper. It is found that a sinusoidal current shape can also be obtained with the proper selection of these parameters. </em...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{automatic}} segmentation method for accurate pupil boundary detection for iris recognition purpose using graph cuts is presented. Most iris segmentation algorithms used for iris recognition consider the pupil as a circular area and fit a circle to its boundary. Considering the pupil to be a circle {{is a method}} which is sensitive to the imaging condition because {{in the case of}} <b>off</b> <b>angle</b> imaging the pupil becomes an ellipse instead of a circle. In addition the pupil cannot be considered a perfect circle even if the <b>off</b> <b>angle</b> imaging is avoided. Most information in iris area exist in the collarette which is a small area around the pupil therefore a small error in detecting the pupil boundary may result in poor performance of the identification system. The presented graph cut method uses the gray level values of pixels to compute the weights of the links in the graph. The graph has two terminals, one represents the pupil and the other one represents the rest of the image, considered as the background. The method is explained and its high performance is demonstrated by experiments based on applying the method on the CASIA eye image database...|$|R

40|$|The main {{target of}} a {{steering}} system is that the driver can change vehicle trajectory {{in accordance with the}} desired direction.  Power steering has become a standard feature in automobile.   It provides assisting power when the driver turns the steering wheel. The well-known power steering types include; Hydraulic Power Steering (HPS), Electro - Hydraulic Power Steering (EHPS), and Electric Power Steering (EPS). EHPS or EPS uses an Electronic Control Unit (ECU) which is specific for each vehicle. The ECU should be able to regulate power of electric motor to provide corresponding assisting power for the steering wheel. Therefore ECU requires input signals, one of which is vehicle wheel angle that can be indicated from the vehicle steering wheel angle. Incremental type of Rotary Encoder (RE) is used in steering angle sensor on a minibus. RE specification used was 60 pulses per rotation and the minibus steering transmission specification is 3. 5 round of right wheel <b>off</b> <b>angle</b> to the left wheel <b>off</b> <b>angle.</b> So we get the RE angular resolution 6 ºper pulse and 105 number of pulses to half of the steering transmission ratio.

The results obtained 2 pulses deviation, or equivalent to 12 º of steering angle. </p...|$|R
