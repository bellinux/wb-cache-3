5|$|Dawson relayed {{this story}} to Bulawayo, where Company {{authorities}} made enquiries. No {{man who had been}} attached to the column corroborated the account. The Company thought it unlikely that a Matabele inDuna would simply invent a story such as this, however, and angrily speculated that if it were true, then negotiations with Lobengula might have been <b>opened</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> war ended before Wilson crossed the river, and the entire episode of the Shangani Patrol avoided (though, as historian Robert Cary writes, this surmision ignores the fact that Forbes had been ordered to capture Lobengula, not end the war). Lawyers appointed by the Company launched a formal investigation early in 1894.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{penetrations}} inland, the key beach objectives had {{not been}} achieved.

5|$|During World War II, a bypass of {{downtown}} South Haven was built; the former route of US31 {{through the heart}} of the city was designated Bus. US31 at that time. After the war, the route of US31 north of Charlevoix was realigned to follow the shoreline; this section opened by the middle of 1949. The route of the highway between Holland and West Olive was changed to run on a more angular course northwesterly in 1950. A few years later, a bypass to the south and east of Holland <b>opened</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> former route through down was redesignated as a business loop in 1954.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, a {{rerouting}} of US16 eliminated M-126 between Nunica and Muskegon; {{the previous}} routing of US16 between Nunica and Ferrysburg was redesignated M-104 at this time. This highway designation was truncated on November 25, 1961, after the I-96/US16 freeway <b>opened,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> section of M-104 between the freeway {{and the old}} US16 routing was transferred to local control. Another short segment of the highway was bypassed when a new bridge was built between Spring Lake and Ferrysburg in 1965.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, a {{southern}} bypass of Battle Creek opened along Columbia Avenue, {{and the former}} routing through downtown on Michigan Avenue became a Business US12 (Bus. US12). In late 1951 or early 1952, a northerly bypass of Jackson <b>opened,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> former route through downtown on Michigan Avenue became another Bus. US12. By the next year, the western half of the Jackson bypass opened, including a bypass of Parma. In 1954, a new bypass of Kalamazoo and Galesburg opened; US12 was rerouted to follow the new highway while M-96 replaced {{part of the old}} route and the US12A in the area.|$|E

5|$|SR 133 was {{constructed}} as a county road by the 1910s; the portion from I-405 to I-5 was upgraded to a freeway four decades later.

In 1998, the majority of the Eastern Transportation Corridor <b>opened,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> connector between I-5 and SR 241 was designated as a toll extension of SR 133.|$|E
5|$|The {{first state}} highway through St. Ignace was an {{extension}} of US31 that was added {{by the end of}} 1927. In 1936, US2 was realigned to run into downtown St. Ignace from the west and replaced US31 through town. The business loop was commissioned in 1960 when the I-75/US2 freeway <b>opened,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> former route of US2 through downtown was renumbered BL I-75.|$|E

5|$|Three spacewalks were {{conducted}} by the crew of STS-97, {{all of which were}} completed prior to opening the hatch between shuttle and station. On 8 December, the hatch between the two was <b>opened</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two crews greeted each other for the first time. It had remained closed to maintain their respective atmospheric pressures. The Expedition 1 crew took this opportunity to leave the station and tour the inside of the space shuttle, which was thought to be good for their psychological well-being.|$|E
5|$|Tyler and the Kentish men {{advanced}} to Canterbury, entering the walled city and castle without resistance on 10 June. The rebels deposed the absent Archbishop of Canterbury, Sudbury, {{and made the}} cathedral monks swear loyalty to their cause. They attacked properties in the city with links to the hated royal council, and searched the city for suspected enemies, dragging the suspects {{out of their houses}} and executing them. The city gaol was <b>opened</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> prisoners freed. Tyler then persuaded a few thousand of the rebels to leave Canterbury and advance with him on London the next morning.|$|E
5|$|Aberdeen {{joint station}} was congested, {{resulting}} in delayed trains, and the low, open platforms were frequently covered in oily slime {{due to the}} large quantities of fish that passed through. Agreement with the Caledonian Railway over rebuilding the station had been reached in 1899, but the companies fell out over widening the line to the south. Moving the goods station to the east was similarly complex, with conflicts with the harbour commissioners and the town council. In 1908 new platforms {{on the western side}} <b>opened</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> adjoining station hotel was bought in 1910. Foundations for the new building were laid in 1913 and the station was largely complete by July 1914, although outbreak of war delayed further progress and the station was finally completed in 1920.|$|E

5|$|After {{the poll}} closes, the {{presiding}} officer of each polling station seals the ballot boxes without opening them. Candidates or their polling agents may affix their own seals to the ballot boxes. The ballot boxes are then taken to counting centres to be <b>opened</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ballots counted. A candidate or {{his or her}} counting agent may ask the returning officer for a recount of votes if {{the difference between the}} number of votes for the candidate with the most votes and any other candidate's number of votes is 2% or less, excluding rejected and tendered votes. After all counts, and recounts if any, have been completed, the returning officer ascertains whether the total number of electors registered to vote overseas is less than the difference between the number of votes for the two candidates with the highest number of votes. If so, the returning officer declares the candidate with the highest number of votes to be elected as President. If not, the overseas votes may be decisive. The returning officer then states the number of votes cast for each candidate and the date and location where the overseas votes will be counted.|$|E
5|$|An {{engineering}} report {{dating back}} to 1961 suggested that building a bypass around the last two mainline tunnels {{was the best way}} to solve the congestion. The Commission awarded three contracts to construct the bypass from July 1966 to March 1967. The contracts cost $17.2 million for roadway and another $2.5 million for construction of a new Sideling Hill Service Plaza to replace the Cove Valley Service Plaza, which was along the to-be-bypassed alignment. The $2.5 million project was to include ramps from both directions to the service plaza, so it could serve both directions. The style of the tunnel bypass was to follow the same style as the Laurel Hill bypass. On November 26, 1968, the three twinned tunnels <b>opened,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bypass of the Rays Hill and Sideling Hill Tunnels opened. The new bypass also opened the Breezewood Interchange and the number of lanes along the turnpike expanded to four (two in each direction) or five (two in each direction, plus a climbing lane going uphill).|$|E
5|$|Another freeway section {{from north}} of Green Bay to Suamico was opened in 1971. In 1972, the divided-highway segment between Suamico and Abrams <b>opened,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> state started the {{construction}} of additional freeways between Green Bay and Milwaukee. The bypasses of Sheboygan and Cedar Grove were converted to full freeways in 1973. Another segment of freeway opened in 1975 that bypassed Port Washington and connected the freeway sections that ended near Grafton and Cedar Grove. I-43 was first designated on the 1978 official state highway map along US141 from Milwaukee to Sheboygan; missing segments of I-43 between Green Bay and Milwaukee are shown as either under construction or proposed. By 1980, the northern bypass of Green Bay was under construction and I-43/US141 was open from Maribel to Branch northwest of Manitowoc; US141 was truncated to end at {{the northern end of}} the Sheboygan bypass. I-43 was initially completed in 1981, and the southern terminus of US141 was moved again, truncating the highway to end in Bellevue by 1983.|$|E
