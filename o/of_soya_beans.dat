The objectives of this experiment were: (1) to determine the response in growing steers to increasing levels of molassed sugar-beet pulp (MSBP) as a supplement to grass silage, (2) to compare MSBP and barley, and (3) to ascertain if there was a response to the inclusion <b>of</b> <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> meal as a protein source with both MSBP and barley. Weanling steers (n = 154) were assigned to the following treatments: (1) silage only, (2) silage plus a low level of MSBP, (3) silage plus a low level <b>of</b> MSBP plus <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> meal, (4) silage plus a high level of MSBP, (5) silage plus a high level <b>of</b> MSBP plus <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> meal, (6) silage plus a high level of barley, and (7) silage plus a high level <b>of</b> barley plus <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> meal. Low MSBP, high MSBP and barley levels were 1. 5 kg, 3. 0 kg and 3. 0 kg per head daily, respectively. Where <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> meal was included it replaced 0. 2 kg/day (low) or 0. 4 kg/day (high) of MSBP or barley. The duration of the treatments was 125 days (winter) after which the animals grazed together for 148 days. Silage intake decreased linearly (P < 0. 001) with increasing MSBP level. Addition <b>of</b> <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> meal had no effect on silage intake with low MSBP or barley but increased (P < 0. 05) intake with high MSBP. Live-weight gain increased both linearly (P < 0. 001) and quadratically (P < 0. 01) with increasing MSBP. There was a significant live-weight response to the addition <b>of</b> <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> meal which was greater at the high than at the low MSBP level and was greater for MSBP than barley.

During shade period, <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> biomass was severely reduced, and stem elongation was stimulated. Typical features of shade grown leaves were found, such as lower LMA (leaf mass per unit area), thinner thickness, higher chlorophyll content, lower chlorophyll a:b ratio.

50|$|Before daybreak on 16 March 2011, the Maltese-registered MS Oliva {{cargo carrier}} ran aground at Spinners Point on the island's northwestern shore.

Malnutrition among the POWs was such a serious problem {{that some of them}} suffered from impaired vision. Accordingly, senior officers among the POWs asked Audus to produce yeast, as he had at Jaarmarkt, to provide the men with needed vitamins to survive. In a 2008 interview, Audus said that his Japanese captors knew that he was producing vitamin-rich yeast and actually promoted his work, and used it to supplement Japanese soldiers' diets.This time, however, there was no maize grain available. He solved this problem by isolating a mould fungus that not only produced the vitamins but also enabled him to produce an easily digestible protein through the fermentation <b>of</b> <b>soya</b> <b>beans.</b> These dietary supplements, in combination with the construction of a sea latrine that stopped a dysentery outbreak, helped lower POW deaths at the camp from 334 over a five-month period to 52 during the nine months preceding liberation. Audus and his fellow prisoners left the camp on 1 August 1945, and when examined at a hospital afterwards, it turned out that he had sustained irreversible damage to his retinas.|$|E

Four irrigation regimes: 80 - 85 % (T 1), 70 - 75 % (T 2), 60 - 65 % (T 3) of field capacity, and non-irrigated regime (T 0) were evaluated each experimental year. The experimental design was a randomised complete block with four replications on a Calcaric Chernozem. Water stress (drought) during growing season in the non-irrigated treatment (T 0) decreased plant physiological activity, vegetative growth, and productivity <b>of</b> <b>soya</b> <b>bean.</b> Irrigation treatments significantly (P < 0. 01) influenced <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> seed yield and yield components. The treatment T 2 produced higher seed yield than T 1 and T 3.

40|$|Nutritional {{value of}} most plant {{materials}} {{is limited by}} the presence of numerous naturally occurring compounds which interfere with nutrient digestion and absorption. Although processing is employed widely in removal of these factors, selection of cultivars <b>of</b> <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> with inherently low levels would have a considerable impact on efficiency of non-ruminant livestock production. The review considers the role of plant breeding in achieving this objective. The most abundant trypsin inhibitors are the Kunitz and the Bowman Birk inhibitors, containing 181 and 71 amino acids respectively. The Kunitz inhibitor is present at a concentration of 1. 4 g/kg of total seed contents and the Bowman Birk inhibitor 1. 6 g/kg. A large number of isoforms of the Bowman Birk inhibitor have been described in soya bean cultivars and {{it has been shown that}} the general properties of the inhibitor are, in fact, attributable to different isoforms. Nulls for both Bowman-Birk and Kunitz trypsin inhibitors have been identified, allowing new low trypsin inhibitor cultivars to be produced. However, research into breeding for low trypsin inhibitor cultivars currently has limited application as trypsin inhibitors contribute a major proportion of the methionine content <b>of</b> <b>soya</b> <b>beans.</b> Trypsin inhibitors are thought to be involved in the regulation of and protection against unwanted proteolysis in plant tissues and also act as a defense mechanism against attack from diseases, insects and animals.

40|$|Solid-substrate fermentations (SSF) are {{restricted}} by heat- and mass transfer limitations, which {{might result in}} unfavourable growth conditions. One way to prevent such conditions is by agitation of the substrate. In this study a Rotating Drum Reactor (RDR) was designed for the fermentation <b>of</b> <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> with Rhizopus oligosporus. The aim {{of the study was}} to develop a process for the controlled fermentation <b>of</b> <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> into a microbiologically safe and protein rich product. The reactor and the measurement and control system enable an automatic control of the process. The most important process parameters are: rotation speed, substrate temperature, rotation frequency and the relative humidity. A major disadvantage of RDR that has been cited in literature is the sensitivity of micro-organisms towards agitation. In our study we have shown that the fungal activity in a discontinuous RDR remained high up to 70 hours while in the traditional non-agitated systems fungal activity decreases already after 36 hours of incubation. During fermentation several enzymes, viz. lipases, proteases, phytases and carbohydrases are formed by R. oligosporus. Due to the enzymatic activity, changes in the chemical composition <b>of</b> <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> were observed. At increasing temperatures a decrease in the total fat content was observed. It was also observed that the level of free fatty acids was lower than expected based on the decrease in glyceride bound fatty acids. This might be explained by the fact that R. oligosporus used fatty acids as a source of carbon. It was also observed that the firmness of the product in the RDR was significantly less compared to the non-agitated samples. In the RDR we observed increased activities of exo-proteases and glycosidases compared with the traditional non-agitated systems. It was shown that lactic acid (> 0. 05 % w/v, pH 4. 2) delayed the germination of Rhizopus oligosporus.

Transcript Mphaka	I am walking along a narrow path leading to a communal field which is 70 to 100 metres from the last house in the boundary of the village. From here I can see a group of people most of them leaning forward, perhaps an indication that they are picking the soya beans. And I am almost there now and I can see a well tended piece of land. It seems they also grew maize on this land because there are some left-over husks all around me. (Song) The women and few men around here have broken into singing, praising the development taking place around here, one of them being the introduction <b>of</b> <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> which they are mentioning in their song, which they are claiming is improving the nutrition status of their malnourished children and home based patients. Chavula	My name is Mercy Chavula. I am the chairperson for the Orphan and Home Based Care Committee in our village. Today we came here to harvest our soya beans from the community garden. Mphaka	I am wondering, is it very beneficial to grow Soya beans here? Chavula	Initially we had no idea that the crop is this nutritious. We used to know that there is soya and we used to see it. But when this ADRA project started, they opened our eyes to the great potential of soya. We now extract milk from soya; can make cakes using its flour, and can also apply the flour into any other relish to make it more nutritious. We use soya to feed the under-nourished orphans and the sick. But of course, everybody else eats as well. There is a noticeable improvement in the health of children who used to be under-nourished, and the sick gain some appetite with soya beans. Mphaka	What is the future <b>of</b> <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> with the phasing out of the ADRA project next year? Chavula	We are not very worried. I think we have been empowered enough to continue. We know how to prepare it nutritiously for food, and above all, we know how to grow it. We feel that very soon, we shall be growing it in larger quantities for sale as well. We have been made to understand that the price at the market is higher than other crops. Mphaka	(Song) As the harvesting <b>of</b> <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> continues with prospects of increased acreage in future, so does the singing. A sign of celebration and satisfaction with the way the health of the community is being improved. From Blantyre, Malawi, I am Patrick Mphaka. (Song continues and fades out). End of track.

40|$|The {{nucleotide}} sequence for the 4. 5 - 5 S ribosomal DNA region from the chloroplastids <b>of</b> <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> was determined {{as the basis}} of further comparative studies on the structure and evolution of this intergenic region. Comparisons with other plant sequences as well as equivalent sequences in eubacteria suggest that the longer internal transcribed spacer regions of plants have evolved, at least in part, by DNA sequence duplications and that the presence of the 4. 5 S rRNA in chloroplast may result from the accidental acquisition of a RNA maturation site during the evolution of longer internal transcribed spacer regions. Estimates of the secondary structures also indicate only a very limited retention of structural features and suggest that the primary role of the intergenic sequences may be to bring processed sites into close proximity...|$|E

The kernels <b>of</b> <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> cultivars Bosa and ZPS 015 were subjected to the treatments of extrusion, autoclaving, micronisation and microwave roasting. Depending on the technological processing procedure, the kernels were exposed to temperatures ranging from 60 to 150 °C for 25 to 30 seconds during extrusion and for 30 minutes during autoclaving. The temperature that developed {{in the course of}} the microwave radiation and autoclaving did not cause statistically significant differences between oil content in heat treated and fresh kernels <b>of</b> <b>soya</b> <b>bean.</b> However, the oil content was higher in <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> flakes (micronized kernels) and lower in grits than in fresh kernels. The heat treatments resulted in the significant decrease of the linolenic fatty acid content. Depending on the temperature and applied heat treatments, the content of linoleic and oleic fatty acid oscillated. High temperatures caused changes in unsaturated fatty acids with 18 carbon atoms resulting in relative increase of the stearic acid content. The lipoxygenase activity decreased in correlation with increased temperatures and the time of heating. The maximum drop of the activity was observed after kernel exposure to the extrusion and micronisation processes at the temperature of 100 oC. However, a significant lipoxygenase activity increase was recorded in both studied cultivars after one-minute microwave heating, i. e. at the temperature about 60 °C. A further temperature increase led to a gradual denaturation of the enzyme and therefore to its decreased activity...|$|R
