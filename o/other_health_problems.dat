5|$|The common cold, {{also known}} simply as a cold, is a viral {{infectious}} disease of the upper respiratory tract that primarily affects the nose. The throat, sinuses, and larynx may also be affected. Signs and symptoms may begin less than two days following exposure. They include coughing, sore throat, runny nose, sneezing, headache, and fever. People usually recover in seven to ten days. Some symptoms may last up to three weeks. In those with <b>other</b> <b>health</b> <b>problems,</b> pneumonia may occasionally develop.|$|E
5|$|Frequent {{hand washing}} {{reduces the risk}} of viral spread. Wearing a {{surgical}} mask is also useful. Yearly vaccinations against influenza are recommended by the World Health Organization for those at high risk. The vaccine is usually effective against three or four types of influenza. It is usually well tolerated. A vaccine made for one year may not be useful in the following year, since the virus evolves rapidly. Antiviral drugs such as the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir, among others, have been used to treat influenza. Their benefits in those who are otherwise healthy {{do not appear to be}} greater than their risks. No benefit has been found in those with <b>other</b> <b>health</b> <b>problems.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pesticides are {{formulated}} to kill pests, {{but many}} have detrimental effects on non-target species; {{of particular concern}} is {{the damage done to}} honey-bees, solitary bees and other pollinating insects and in this regard, the time of day when the spray is applied can be important. The widely used neonicotinoids have been banned on flowering crops in some countries because of their effects on bees. Some pesticides may cause cancer and <b>other</b> <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> in humans, as well as being harmful to wildlife. There can be acute effects immediately after exposure or chronic effects after continuous low-level, or occasional exposure. Maximum residue limits for pesticides in foodstuffs and animal feed are set by many nations.|$|E
5000|$|Medical therapies or {{treatments}} are efforts to cure or improve a disease or <b>other</b> <b>health</b> <b>problem.</b> In the medical field, therapy {{is synonymous with}} the word treatment.

5|$|The {{mainstay}} {{treatment of}} epilepsy is anticonvulsant medications, possibly for the person's entire life. The choice of anticonvulsant {{is based on}} seizure type, epilepsy syndrome, other medications used, <b>other</b> <b>health</b> <b>problems,</b> and the person's age and lifestyle. A single medication is recommended initially; {{if this is not}} effective, switching to a single other medication is recommended. Two medications at once is recommended only if a single medication does not work. In about half, the first agent is effective; a second single agent helps in about 13% and a third or two agents at the same time may help an additional 4%. About 30% of people continue to have seizures despite anticonvulsant treatment.|$|E

5|$|In adults, viruses {{account for}} {{approximately}} {{a third and}} in children for about 15% of pneumonia cases. Commonly implicated agents include rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, and parainfluenza. Herpes simplex virus rarely causes pneumonia, except in groups such as: newborns, persons with cancer, transplant recipients, and people with significant burns. People following organ transplantation or those otherwise-immunocompromised present high rates of cytomegalovirus pneumonia. Those with viral infections may be secondarily infected with the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, or Haemophilus influenzae, particularly when <b>other</b> <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> are present. Different viruses predominate at different periods of the year; during influenza season, for example, influenza may account for over half of all viral cases. Outbreaks of other viruses also occasionally occur, including hantaviruses and coronavirus.|$|E
5|$|Influenza spreads {{around the}} world in a yearly outbreak, {{resulting}} in about three to five million cases of severe illness and about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths. In the Northern and Southern parts of the world, outbreaks occur mainly in winter while in areas around the equator outbreaks may occur at any time of the year. Death occurs mostly in the young, the old and those with <b>other</b> <b>health</b> <b>problems.</b> Larger outbreaks known as pandemics are less frequent. In the 20th century, three influenza pandemics occurred: Spanish influenza in 1918 (~50 million deaths), Asian influenza in 1957 (two million deaths), and Hong Kong influenza in 1968 (one million deaths). The World Health Organization declared an outbreak of a new type of influenza A/H1N1 to be a pandemic in June 2009. Influenza may also affect other animals, including pigs, horses and birds.|$|E
5|$|NSAIDs are {{the usual}} {{first-line}} treatment for gout. No specific agent is significantly {{more or less}} effective than any other. Improvement may be seen within four hours and treatment is recommended for one to two weeks. They are not recommended, however, in those with certain <b>other</b> <b>health</b> <b>problems,</b> such as gastrointestinal bleeding, kidney failure, or heart failure. While indometacin has historically been {{the most commonly used}} NSAID, an alternative, such as ibuprofen, may be preferred due to its better side effect profile in the absence of superior effectiveness. For those at risk of gastric side effects from NSAIDs, an additional proton pump inhibitor may be given. There is some evidence that COX-2 inhibitors may work as well as nonselective NSAIDs for acute gout attack with fewer side effects.|$|E

5|$|Negative {{effects of}} the coast trade on the native peoples of the Northwest {{included}} waves of epidemic disease, smallpox worst of all. <b>Other</b> <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> included the spread of alcoholism, tuberculosis, venereal diseases including syphilis, and sterility. The coast trade also promoted and enhanced the pre-existing system of native slavery and native slave trading. The overall number of slaves increased, as did their distribution and exploitation. Despite these negative effects, the North West Coast natives were largely spared the additional effects that would have come had there been more permanent posts, political administration, missionizing, and colonization. The early traders were mostly seasonal visitors and the later HBC posts were few and small. Missionization and direct colonial rule over the coastal natives did not begin in earnest until the late 19th century. During the early 19th century, native culture not only survived but flourished.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{establish}} {{the effect of}} self-rated and measured functional hearing on depression, taking age and gender into account. Additionally, the study investigates if hearing-aid usage mitigates the effect, and if <b>other</b> physical <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> and social engagement confound it. Design: Cross-sectional data from the UK Biobank resource, including subjective and behavioural measures of functional hearing and multifactorial measures of depressive episodes and symptoms, were accessed and analysed using multi-regression analyses. Study sample: Over 100 000 community-dwelling, 39 – 70 year-old volunteers. Results: Irrespective of measurement method, poor functional hearing was significantly (p < 0. 001) associated {{with higher levels of}} depressive episodes (≤ 0. 16 factor scores) and depressive symptoms (≤ 0. 30 factor scores) when controlling for age and gender. Associations were stronger for subjective reports, for depressive symptoms, and the younger participants. Females generally reported higher levels of depression. Hearing-aid usage did not show a mitigating effect on the associations. <b>Other</b> physical <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> particularly partially confounded the effects. Conclusion: Data support an association between functional hearing and depression that is stronger in the younger participants (40 – 49 years old) and for milder depression. The association was not alleviated by hearing-aid usage, but was partially confounded by <b>other</b> physical <b>health</b> <b>problems.</b> 12 page(s...|$|R
