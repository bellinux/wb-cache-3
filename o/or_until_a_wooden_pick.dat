In 1875, the present church building opened, as the region's Catholic population, mainly of French Canadian and Irish immigrant origin, began to grow rapidly. Following the creation of the dioceses in 1904, this facility was elevated to cathedral status. In 1936, the parish assumed its current name.|$|R

50|$|Some of {{the fabric}} of the current {{building}} is from the 16th century. Further work was undertaken in the 17th century when the church was known as All Saints. In 1810 a south extension was built, although the Elizabethan windows were relocated and reused in the south wall. The church fell into a state if disrepair and in 1856 suffered a Victorian restoration under the architect C.E. Giles. The priest responsible for the rebuilding and restoration of 1856 to 1859, Samuel Heathcote (at the Church 1854 to 1906), was appointed Perpetual curate but was signing the registers as Vicar from 21 November 1889 showing that Williton had become a parish separate from Watchet. The church had <b>a</b> small spire <b>until</b> it was damaged during a storm after which the bells were housed <b>until</b> <b>a</b> <b>wooden</b> bellcote <b>until</b> <b>a</b> new stone one was built in 1896.|$|R
