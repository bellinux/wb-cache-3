It reported income before grants to IDA members of $2.18 billion in fiscal year 2011, up from $1.95 billion in fiscal 2010 and $299 million in fiscal 2009. The increase in income before grants is ascribed to higher earnings from the IFC's investments and also from higher service fees. The IFC reported a partial offset from lower liquid asset trading income, higher administrative costs, and higher advisory service expenses. The IFC made $600 million in grants to IDA countries in fiscal 2011, up from $200 million in fiscal 2010 and $450 million in fiscal 2009. The IFC reported a net income of $1.58 billion in fiscal year 2011. In previous years, the IFC had reported {{a net loss of}} $151 million in fiscal 2009 and $1.75 billion in fiscal 2010.

A review {{of this debate}} reveals that investors have traditionally argued for more <b>comprehensive</b> definitions of <b>income,</b> whereas managers have traditionally argued for less comprehensive measures. We compare performance for both income definitions and component sets. Our results reveal that among <b>income</b> definitions, <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> defined by Statement 130 dominates both traditional net <b>income</b> and fully <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income.</b> No definition dominates clearly.

40|$|The {{financial}} {{performance of the}} firms {{is one of the}} major concerns for the users of financial statements. Accounting standard setting bodies have encouraged firms to report <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> which is believed to have much more value relevant information than traditional net income. The objective of this paper is to assess the usefulness of <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> and net income in explaining future firm performance. Based on a sample that includes 102 non-financial firms, the empirical analysis indicates that there are advantages of reporting <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> in predicting corporate {{financial performance}}.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to compare the {{usefulness}} between net <b>income</b> and <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income.</b> The results by SUR (seemingly unrelated regression) show the following evidence. Although net income is more persistent than <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> in one year, the persistence of <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> is higher than net income in another year. We cannot support the claim that one is always more persistent than another. Consistent with prior expectation, <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> is more timely than net income. However, we cannot meaningfully test the effect of conservatism on both income. The value relevance and price informativeness of net income is not significantly different from those of <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income.</b> We cannot find the strong evidence, which support the insistence that one is superior to another. These empirical results will make a important contribution to the setting of accounting standard for performanc...|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} some market based {{evidence on the}} usefulness of <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> disclosures in a Statement of Changes in Equity (SCE). Using a sample of listed New Zealand firms, we find no evidence that separate disclosure of the <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> items provides any value relevant information {{above and beyond the}} aggregate <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> figure. Likewise, in the post-SCE period, we find no evidence of an increase in the incremental value relevance of the <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> items over net income. While our results are sensitive to outliers, they suggest that standards requiring disclosure of a SCE may not be necessary. Copyright Blackwell Publishers Ltd 2000. ...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{international}} {{trends in}} the reporting of <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> {{can be summed up}} as follows: the new reporting format for <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> that the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) have set their sights on for future introduction will lead to a fundamentally different way of reporting <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> from the current IASB standards (IAS 1 as revised in 2007), current FASB standards (FAS 130) and current Japanese standards, which more or less advocate the same method of business performance reporting. Whereas both net <b>income</b> and <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> are reported under the current business performance reporting format, the proposed new IASB/FASB format will banish net income from performance reporting.

Essentially, our study provides a market test of the Maines and McDaniel (2000) hypothesis that the inclusion of noncore operations in <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> may introduce extraneous noise for investors as a single class. We find evidence that the incorporation of revaluations of non-current operating assets and the non-reporting of extraordinary items in <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> significantly reduces value relevance, with net income from ordinary operations the dominant valuation metric.
