5|$|Concerned at {{the expense}} of {{maintaining}} the Falkland Islands in an era <b>of</b> <b>budget</b> cuts, the UK again considered transferring sovereignty to Argentina in the early Thatcher government.

After the war, the United Kingdom expanded its military presence, building RAF Mount Pleasant and increasing the size of its garrison. The war also left some 117 minefields containing nearly 20,000 mines of various types, including anti-vehicle and anti-personnel mines. Due to the large number of deminer casualties, initial attempts to clear the mines ceased in 1983.|$|E
