5|$|The {{little brown}} bat (sometimes called little brown myotis) (Myotis lucifugus) is {{a species of}} the genus Myotis (mouse-eared bats), {{one of the most}} common bats of North America. It has been a model {{organism}} for the study <b>of</b> <b>bats</b> (chiropterology).|$|E
5|$|The phylogenetic {{relationships}} {{of the different}} groups <b>of</b> <b>bats</b> {{have been the subject}} of much debate. The traditional subdivision between Megachiroptera and Microchiroptera reflected the view that these groups <b>of</b> <b>bats</b> had evolved independently of each other for a long time, from a common ancestor already capable of flight. This hypothesis recognized differences between microbats and megabats and acknowledged that flight has only evolved once in mammals. Most molecular biological evidence supports the view that bats form a single or monophyletic group. In the 1980s, a hypothesis based on morphological evidence was offered that stated the Megachiroptera evolved flight separately from the Microchiroptera. The so-called flying primate hypothesis proposed that, when adaptations to flight are removed, the Megachiroptera are allied to primates by anatomical features not shared with Microchiroptera. For example, the brains of megabats have advanced characteristics that link them to primates. Although recent genetic studies strongly support the monophyly <b>of</b> <b>bats,</b> debate continues as to the meaning of available genetic and morphological evidence.|$|E

40|$|The {{original}} {{objective of}} work {{described in this}} thesis was to study neural control of diet-induced thermogenesis in BAT. The hypothesis was that impairment of central warmth perception by capsaicin-desensitization (CAP-DES) would diminish central suppression <b>of</b> <b>BAT</b> thermogenesis by heat generated {{as a consequence of}} food ingestion, and thus enhance sympathetic-mediated diet-induced hypertrophy <b>of</b> <b>BAT.</b> Unexpectedly, CAP-DES caused atrophy <b>of</b> <b>BAT</b> and prevented diet-induced thermogenesis in BAT. This novel finding led to a modification of objectives to find out why CAP-DES induces atrophy <b>of</b> <b>BAT</b> and to study further the consequences for the CAP-DES rat of the atrophied state <b>of</b> its <b>BAT.</b> Atrophy <b>of</b> <b>BAT</b> in the CAP-DES rat involved loss of total protein, loss of mitochondrial proteins and loss <b>of</b> cells. <b>BAT</b> <b>of</b> the CAP-DES rat was unresponsive to stimulation by diet and cold-induced growth was retarded. The most extensive destruction <b>of</b> <b>BAT</b> occurred at 1 day, gradually reversed over the next 28 days, then reappeared at 8 months. A preliminary study in which a neurotransmitter of sensory nerves, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) was infused for several days suggested that the effect of CAP-DES might be due to removal of a trophic influence of neuropeptides of sensory nerves, known to be depleted in <b>BAT</b> <b>of</b> the CAP-DES rat. The association between atrophied BAT and obesity in several different animal models suggested that CAP-DES rats might become obese. However, CAP-DES rats fed an obesity-inducing diet (high fat) for 10 weeks did not become any more obese than control rats eating the same diet and aging-induced obesity was reduced in the CAP-DES rat. Conclusions. Neuropeptides of sensory nerves {{play an important role in}} control <b>of</b> <b>BAT</b> thermogenic capacity, supplementing that of noradrenaline. The relation <b>of</b> atrophied <b>BAT</b> to energy balance in the CAP-DES rat remains to be elucidated...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess {{independent}} predictors of 2 -deoxy- 2 -[(18) F]fluoro-D-glucose ((18) F-FDG) uptake in brown adipose tissue (BAT) in patients undergoing repeated positron emission tomography (PET) /computed tomography (CT) scans. PROCEDURES: Eight hundred forty-eight (mean age 50. 9 [*]±[*] 16 years) patients in whom PET/CT scan was repeated (mean interval 5 [*]±[*] 1. 5 months) constituted the study group. (18) F-FDG uptake in characteristic areas <b>of</b> <b>BAT,</b> with CT density of adipose tissue, greater than background soft-tissue activity was considered as evidence <b>of</b> <b>BAT</b> uptake. Both distribution and maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) were registered. Clinical and anamnestic data were collected for each patient. RESULTS: (18) F-FDG uptake in BAT was present in 8. 6 % patients at first scan. Independent predictors of presence of uptake were age (younger), gender (female), body mass index (lower), and maximum outdoor temperature (lower). Age was the only independent predictor <b>of</b> <b>BAT</b> (18) F-FDG uptake distribution, while SUVmax was related to both age and outdoor temperature. Independent determinants <b>of</b> persistence <b>of</b> <b>BAT</b> (18) F-FDG uptake at second PET/CT were outdoor temperature at time of second scan and extension <b>of</b> metabolically active <b>BAT</b> at first scan. CONCLUSIONS: Age, body mass index, and outdoor temperature are significant determinants <b>of</b> <b>BAT</b> evidence at (18) F-FDG PET/CT. Moreover, extension <b>of</b> <b>BAT</b> and outdoor temperature are the strongest determinants <b>of</b> persistence <b>of</b> <b>BAT</b> evidence on (18) F-FDG PET/CT in repeated scan...|$|R

40|$|From mouse to man, brown {{adipose tissue}} (BAT) is a {{significant}} source of thermogenesis contributing to the maintenance of the body temperature homeostasis during the challenge of low environmental temperature. In rodents, BAT thermogenesis also contributes to the febrile increase in core temperature during the immune response. BAT sympathetic nerve activity controlling BAT thermogenesis is regulated by CNS neural networks which respond reflexively to thermal afferent signals from cutaneous and body core thermoreceptors, as well as to alterations in the discharge of central neurons with intrinsic thermosensitivity. Superimposed on the core thermoregulatory circuit for the activation <b>of</b> <b>BAT</b> thermogenesis, is the permissive, modulatory influence of central neural networks controlling metabolic aspects of energy homeostasis. The recent confirmation of the presence <b>of</b> <b>BAT</b> in human and its function as an energy consuming organ have stimulated interest in the potential for the pharmacological activation <b>of</b> <b>BAT</b> to reduce adiposity in the obese. In contrast, the inhibition <b>of</b> <b>BAT</b> thermogenesis could facilitate the induction of therapeutic hypothermia for fever reduction or to improve outcomes in stroke or cardiac ischemia by reducing infarct size through a lowering of metabolic oxygen demand. This review summarizes the central circuits for the autonomic control <b>of</b> <b>BAT</b> thermogenesis and highlights the potential clinical relevance of the pharmacological inhibition or activation <b>of</b> <b>BAT</b> thermogenesis...|$|R
5|$|The finger bones <b>of</b> <b>bats</b> {{are much}} more {{flexible}} than those of other mammals, owing to their flattened cross-section and to low levels of minerals, such as calcium, near their tips. The elongation of bat digits, a key feature required for wing development, {{is due to the}} upregulation of bone morphogenetic proteins (Bmps). During embryonic development, the gene controlling Bmp signaling, Bmp2, is subjected to increased expression in bat forelimbs—resulting in the extension of the manual digits. This crucial genetic alteration helps create the specialized limbs required for volant locomotion. The relative proportion of extant bat forelimb digits compared with those of Eocene fossil bats have no significant differences in relative digit proportion, suggesting that bat wing morphology has been conserved for over 50 million years. During flight, the bones take on bending and shearing stress; and the bending stresses felt are smaller than terrestrial mammals, however the shearing stress is larger. The wing bones <b>of</b> <b>bats</b> have a slightly lower breaking stress point than those of birds.|$|E

5|$|A common idea in {{the comics}} is that Bruce saw a Zorro film with his parents before they were murdered.

5|$|Even {{though the}} fossil record <b>of</b> <b>bats</b> extends over 50 million years, their fossils are {{extremely}} rare. The fossil record of the greater noctule in the Iberian Peninsula suggests that they lived at different geographical locations from that of today.

40|$|BACKGROUND The uptake of 18 F-FDG {{in brown}} adipose tissue (BAT) may have {{important}} implications in understanding the pathophysiology <b>of</b> <b>BAT</b> and obesity. Because of the thermal implications <b>of</b> <b>BAT</b> uptake <b>of</b> 18 F-FDG, this study aimed to contribute to existing knowledge by assessing patients scanned in a subtropical environment with particular reference to ethnicity. PATIENTS AND METHODS A retrospective study was carried out to determine the prevalence and pattern <b>of</b> <b>BAT</b> uptake in patients undergoing 18 F-FDG PET-CT imaging in a PET facility located in a subtropical climatic zone. Standardized uptake values were obtained for regions <b>of</b> <b>BAT</b> uptake <b>of</b> 18 F-FDG, and the distribution pattern was assessed according to anatomical region, sex, age, BMI and ethnicity. RESULTS Following a reveiw {{of a total of}} 386 scans, 38 patients showed <b>BAT</b> uptake <b>of</b> 18 F-FDG (9. 85 %), with the mass and activity <b>of</b> <b>BAT</b> being greater in women than in men (11. 95 and 6. 88 %, respectively). <b>BAT</b> uptake <b>of</b> 18 F-FDG in the neck/supraclavicular, axillary and mediastinal regions was greater in adults whose BMI was less than 18 kg/m 2. However, perirenal BAT activity was shown to be greater in obese individuals. The frequency <b>of</b> <b>BAT</b> uptake <b>of</b> 18 F-FDG was 55 % in winter as against 45 % during summer (P< 0. 012). There was no statistical difference in BAT uptake between black and white patients. CONCLUSION This study shows the pattern and prevalence <b>of</b> <b>BAT</b> in patients in a subtropical environment. Although the average seasonal temperatures are higher in a subtropical climate, a seasonal variation in BAT expression was observed, although there were no differences with respect to patient ethnicity.
