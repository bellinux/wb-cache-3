2500|$|It is {{not within}} the scope of this paper, however, to discuss {{technical}} criteria by which hypotheses are given high, low, or negative degrees of confirmation. <b>Our</b> <b>purpose</b> is simply to glance at several examples of a type of scientific activity which fails completely to conform to scientific standards, {{but at the same time}} is the result of such intricate mental activity that it wins temporary acceptance by many laymen insufficiently informed to recognize the scientist's incompetence. Although there obviously is no sharp line separating competent from incompetent research, and there are occasions when a scientific [...] "orthodoxy" [...] may delay the acceptance of novel views, the fact remains that the distance between the work of competent scientists and the speculations of a Voliva or Velikovsky is so great that a qualitative difference emerges which justifies the label of [...] "pseudo-science."

2500|$|If {{the parties}} {{themselves}} could {{agree to the}} terms, the Code as a rule left them free to make contracts. Their deed of agreement was drawn up in the temple by a notary public and confirmed with an oath [...] "by god and the king."

The manner in which it was executed may have been sufficient guarantee that its stipulations were not impious or illegal. Custom or public opinion doubtlessly ensured that the parties would not agree to [...] "wrong". If a dispute arose, the judges dealt first with the contract. They might not sustain it, but if the parties did not dispute it, they were free to observe it. The judges' decision might, however, be appealed. Many contracts contain the proviso that in case of future dispute, the parties would abide by [...] "the decision of the king." [...] The Code made known, in a vast number of cases, what that decision would be, and many cases of appeal to the king were returned to the judges with orders to decide in accordance with it.

2500|$|Psychology was {{a popular}} topic in Enlightenment Europe. In Germany, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646â€“1716) applied his {{principles}} of calculus to the mind, arguing that mental activity took place on an indivisible continuumâ€”most notably, that among an infinity of human perceptions and desires, the difference between conscious and unconscious awareness {{is only a matter}} of degree. Christian Wolff identified psychology as its own science, writing Psychologia empirica in 1732 and Psychologia rationalis in 1734. This notion advanced further under Immanuel Kant, who established the idea of anthropology, with psychology as an important subdivision. However, Kant explicitly and notoriously rejected the idea of experimental psychology, writing that [...] "the empirical doctrine of the soul can also never approach chemistry even as a systematic art of analysis or experimental doctrine, for in it the manifold of inner observation can be separated only by mere division in thought, and cannot then be held separate and recombined at will (but still less does another thinking subject suffer himself to be experimented upon to suit <b>our</b> <b>purpose),</b> and even observation by itself already changes and displaces the state of the observed object." [...] Having consulted philosophers Hegel and Herbart, in 1825 the Prussian state established psychology as a mandatory discipline in its rapidly expanding and highly influential educational system. However, this discipline did not yet embrace experimentation. In England, early psychology involved phrenology and the response to social problems including alcoholism, violence, and the country's well-populated mental asylums.|$|E
2500|$|Change {{of title}} and {{extension}} of scope â€“ Preface to Volume 6.Editorial AnnouncementThe Editors desire to announce to their readers an important modification in {{the scope and}} contents of this work. As originally planned and hitherto announced, the series was intended to furnish the original sources, printed and documentary, {{for the history of}} the Philippine Islands only {{to the beginning of the}} nineteenth century. To most of our readers, the reasons for this are obvious: the fact that the classic period of Philippine history is thus bounded; the comparative rarity and inaccessibility of most material therein to the general public; the vast extent of the field covered by Philippine history, and the necessary limitations of space imposed upon the selection of material for this work; the closing of foreign archives to all investigators after an early date in the nineteenth century; and the greater difficulty, in that later period, of securing a proper historical perspective. But so many and urgent requests have come to us, from subscribers and reviewers, for such extension of this series as shall cover the entire period of Spanish domination, that we have decided to modify the former plan in the manner here briefly indicated.It is <b>our</b> <b>purpose</b> not to exceed the number of volumes already announced, fifty-five. We are able to do this because in our original plan, to avoid a subsequent increase in the number of volumes, a certain amount of space was purposely left for possible future changes as a result of later investigations to be made in foreign archives, or on account of the necessary excision of extraneous or irrelevant matter from the printed works which are to be presented in this series. The new title will be [...] "The Philippine Islands: 1493â€“1898." [...] The early and especially important history of the islands will be covered as fully as before. For the history of the nineteenth century, we will present various important decrees, reports, and other official documents; and provide a clear, careful, and impartial synopsis of some of the best historical matter extant, down to the close of the Spanish rÃ©gime. Throughout the series will be used, as has been done from the beginning, all the best material available â€“ historical, descriptive, and statistical â€“ for reference and annotation. With the copious and prepared bibliography of Philippine historical literature, and the full analytical index, which will close the series; the broad and representative character of the material selected throughout; and the impartial and non-sectarian attitude maintained, the Editors trust that this change will still further enable scholars, historical writers, and general readers alike to study, with reliable and satisfactory material, the history of the Philippine Islands from their first discovery by Europeans to the close of the Spanish rÃ©gime, and incidentally the history of the entire Orient.|$|E
