40|$|Ten {{years on}} from signing the <b>Ohrid</b> Framework <b>Agreement,</b> is the Republic of Macedonia’s peace process, of which {{municipal}} decentralisation {{is a primary}} component, broadly benefitting all communities equally? To what extent is municipal decentralisation and minority protection mechanisms administered {{at the local level}} preserving Macedonian society’s multiethnic character, or has the country taken a step closer towards the development of a binational state? There were definitely ‘winners’ {{as a result of the}} <b>Ohrid</b> Framework <b>Agreement,</b> but were there also ‘losers’, and who are they? The decentralisation process in Macedonia has widely been regarded as a success story by regional and international actors alike. It is frequently considered a suitable model of ethnic conflict management that can be replicated in other regional contexts, such as for Serbs living in neighbouring Kosovo. Decentralisation sought to offer limited autonomy to Macedonia’s ethnic communities, in particular the ethnic Albanians. By increasing the number of competencies administered at the municipal level, the reforms aimed to provide local, culturally diverse communities greater control over the management of their own affairs. This paper seeks to apprise the minority rights protection mechanisms contained in the 2001 <b>Ohrid</b> Framework <b>Agreement,</b> particularly those at the municipal level, along with implementation of the wider of decentralisation reforms. The paper will also consider the claim that the protection mechanisms envisaged in Ohrid and the process of decentralisation to date has not benefitted all Macedonia’s ethnic communities equally. Instead, it has reinforced steps towards bi-nationalism at the expense of genuine multiculturalism...|$|R

Georgievski was accused of direct involvement in the conflict, to the point of having ignited it, for personal benefits.

50|$|An {{autonomy}} referendum {{was held}} in Macedonia on 7 November 2004. Voters were asked whether they approved of overturning the municipal redistricting plans that gave greater autonomy to ethnic Albanians following the <b>Ohrid</b> <b>Agreement</b> that ended the 2001 conflict between ethnic Albanian militants and the predominantly ethnic Macedonian government forces.

40|$|The <b>Ohrid</b> Framework <b>Agreement</b> (OFA) {{was signed}} on 13 August 2001. The signing of this {{agreement}} {{was a response to}} the armed conflict in Macedonia between the Macedonian Army and police and the paramilitary Albanian National Liberation Army (NLA). With the OFA, some of the demands of the ethnic Albanians in Macedonia were accepted. Even though officially signed in Skopje, the agreement was called the <b>Ohrid</b> Framework <b>Agreement</b> {{due to the fact that}} the signing was preceded by a series of negotiations that took place mainly in Ohrid. The signatories of the OFA were the leaders of the four biggest political parties in Macedonia (the two biggest ethnic Macedonian and the two biggest ethnic Albanian parties), the president, and one special representative each of the USA and the European Union (EU), respectively. Therefore, the agreement is guaranteed by the international community. Nevertheless, there was no official UN resolution, similar to that for Kosovo’s conflict, for example. The purpose of this chapter is to analyze and comment on all ten points in the agreement which provided a foundation for a new power-sharing system and internal restructuring of Macedonia, mainly through constitutional amendments, and passing new and revising old laws. In spite of the fact that the OFA may seem controversial, it was a response to the circumstances in which it was signed – an armed conflict and harsh international pressure. Debates on the decisions of the agreement, its meaning, and role continue today. ...|$|R

Since an Albanian armed insurgency erupted in February 2001, the political agenda had indeed been virtually dominated by interethnic issues. In 2001, early international involvement had prevented the armed confrontation from turning into a full scale civil war.
