5000|$|The United Nations Charter [...] prohibits {{not only}} the use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> but also the threat of such use <b>of</b> <b>force,</b> but there is {{discussion}} on whether this prohibition applies only to (militarily) credible threats, whether (or when) {{the threat of the}} use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> in self-defence is permitted, and what actions (not necessarily accompanied by a verbal threat) can be considered a threat. [...] The International Court of Justice has provided guidance on the legality of the use of threats: generally, if the use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> would be lawful, the threat of such use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> is also legal, and if the actual use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> is later found lawful, then the prior threat is also deemed lawful.|$|R
5|$|Long {{before the}} first incarcerees arrived in March 1942, Manzanar was home to Native Americans, who lived mostly in villages near several creeks in the area. Ranchers and miners {{formally}} established the town of Manzanar in 1910, but abandoned the town by 1929 after the City of Los Angeles purchased the water rights to virtually the entire area. As different as these groups were, their histories displayed a common thread <b>of</b> <b>forced</b> relocation.|$|E
5|$|Lung {{function}} {{testing is}} carried out by evaluating a person's capacity to inhale and exhale in different circumstances. The volume of air inhaled and exhaled by a person at rest is the tidal volume (normally 500-750mL); the inspiratory reserve volume and expiratory reserve volume are the additional amounts a person is able to forcibly inhale and exhale respectively. The summed total <b>of</b> <b>forced</b> inspiration and expiration is a person's vital capacity. Not all air is expelled from the lungs even after a forced breath out; {{the remainder of the}} air is called the residual volume. Together these terms are referred to as lung volumes.|$|E
5|$|Ninety-five {{per cent}} of bird species are {{socially}} monogamous. These species pair {{for at least}} the length of the breeding season or—in some cases—for several years or until the death of one mate. Monogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care, which is especially important for species in which females require males' assistance for successful brood-rearing. Among many socially monogamous species, extra-pair copulation (infidelity) is common. Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males, but may also be the result <b>of</b> <b>forced</b> copulation in ducks and other anatids.|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} substantive {{framework of}} the use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> in international law has been challenged by recent developments involving non-state actors. This dissertation considers {{the legality of the}} use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> against non-state actors, specifically terrorists, where the terrorist acts are not attributable to the territorial state. The United States' air campaign against the Islamic State in Syria is examined to determine whether the United States' conduct constitutes a lawful exercise of the use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> in international law. The substantive {{framework of the}} use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> in international law is first analysed, which includes an explanation of the scope of the prohibition of the use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> in international law and the various exceptions to this prohibition. This is followed by a description of the focus of this paper, terrorism and counterterrorism, and of the development of the use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> against terrorists in international law. The current status of the use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> against terrorists in international law is elucidated. The United States' use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> against the Islamic State in Syria is contextualised through the provision of a brief history of the conflict in Syria and the emergence of the Islamic State as a terrorist threat. Possible legal justifications regarding United States' use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> in Syria are examined to conclude whether the air strikes are lawful in terms of international law on the use <b>of</b> <b>force.</b> It is hoped that this paper will contribute to the growing debate about the legality of the use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> against terrorists and eventually, to a clearer framework on the use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> in international law...|$|R

40|$|News and/or {{claims on}} {{excessive}} use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> {{by law enforcement}} officials to civilians {{have been placed in}} media outlets. Not only in Turkey, but also in all the world, excessive use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> is considered as a violent act independent from its having a legal basis. It is occured both in physical form and in the form of threats, gestures, intimidation and abusive language. This article investigates use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> by law enforcement moving from the general literature and specifically focuses on the problem of excessive use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> in Turkey regarding both legal basis <b>of</b> use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> and determinants <b>of</b> applying excessive <b>force.</b> Discussion in the article depends on literature, face-to-face interviews, and media sources. Determinants of excessive use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> are argued to have legal, organizational, individual, political and technical aspects. At the end, some policy implications for policymakers and practitioners on preventing excessive use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> will be discusse...|$|R

Some Western critics, including Dutch critic A. Teeuw and writer A. H. Johns, consider it to be the first true Indonesian novel, as opposed to Azab dan Sengsara, which was less developed in its theme <b>of</b> <b>forced</b> marriage and the negative aspects of adat.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese, {{after their}} arrival in Sri Lanka in 1505, began a {{campaign}} <b>of</b> <b>forced</b> conversion {{and destruction of}} many Buddhist and Hindu temples around the island. They destroyed the Munneswaram temple completely in 1578 CE {{with the exception of}} the basement, and used the core of the building as a Roman Catholic chapel. Jesuits recorded that they used iron bars to destroy the presiding deity. According to a 1640 Portuguese records, they were able to convert 500 people from the village of Munneswaram as Roman Catholics. However, the locals and temple administrators were able to hide many of the idols of the temple complex before the destruction.|$|E

According to the proclamation, {{as a result of these}} offenses, the god Marduk abandoned Babylon and sought a more righteous king. Marduk called forth Cyrus to enter Babylon and become its new ruler.|$|E

For {{there to be}} robbery there must be [...] "force or fear" [...] in perpetrating the theft. Questions concerning the degree <b>of</b> <b>force</b> necessary for robbery {{have been the subject}} of much litigation. Merely snatching the property from the victim's person is not sufficient force unless the victim resists or one of the items is attached or carried in such a way that a significant amount <b>of</b> <b>force</b> must be used to free the item from the victim's person.|$|R

40|$|The United Nations Charter's use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> {{paradigm}} prohibits all uses <b>of</b> <b>force</b> {{by states}} except {{in respect of}} self-defence or when authorised by the Security Council. However, in 1999, NATO, without express authorisation from the Security Council, undertook non-defensive military action against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, {{in response to the}} ongoing crisis in Kosovo. Then, in March 2003, the United States led a coalition of states in a war against Iraq. This military action was also not expressly authorised by the Security Council. Both of these uses <b>of</b> <b>force</b> are ~neral 1 y considered to constitute primafacie breaches of the Charter's use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> paradigm. These breaches of the Charter have led some observers to claim that the [...] :f Charter's use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> paradigm is now 'dead'. It is argued that the invasion of Iraq by the United States-led coalition represents a fmal assault on the Charter's use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> rules. These spectacular breaches of the Charter demonstrate that states no longer consider the Charter's use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> paradigm to be authoritative and controlling. Thereby, the Charter's use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> paradigm is no longer valid. Through the prism ofKosovo and Iraq, this thesis examines the question of :he impact of breaches of the Charter's use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> paradigm upon its :ontinued validity. It is posited that although the Charter's use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> rules lave been breached, these breaches do not mean that the Charter's use of orce paradigm is repudiated by states and thereby no longer valid. It is ontended that in spite of these breaches the Charter's use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> laradigm remains authoritative. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
