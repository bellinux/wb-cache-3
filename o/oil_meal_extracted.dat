40|$|The {{antioxidant}} {{activity of}} methanolic extracts from Sclerocarya birrea kernel <b>oil</b> <b>meal,</b> <b>extracted</b> using two different methods was evaluated. The extraction {{was carried out}} using magnetic stirring of the material in methanol/water (80 : 20 v/v) overnight followed by two ultra-sonic treatments for 45 min. (Overnight extract, ONEXT) and three ultra-sonic treatments for 45 min. only (Ultra-sonic extract, USEXT), respectively. Three fractions were obtained from each extract and the contents of total phenolic compounds were determined in each fraction according to the Folin-Ciocalteau method as 34. 6, 54. 8, and 58. 6 mg/g of dry product in ONEXT and 29. 6, 84. 8, 143. 9 mg/g in USEXT, respectively. The antioxidant activity of the extracts was evaluated according to the β -carotene-linoleic acid assay, where the extracts and their fractions showed significant effect (p< 0. 05). The antioxidative properties of the extracts obtained from the two extraction methods described were similar. The AAC (antioxidant activity coefficient) of these extracts and their fractions increased with an increasing concentration of the extract. The effect of ONEXT and USEXT at the 0. 2 and 0. 8 % levels on the oxidative stability of sunflower oil at 70 °C was tested {{in the dark and}} compared with the commonly used synthetic antioxidant BHA. The oil peroxide values (PVs) were significantly (p< 0. 05) lower with the addition of extract in comparison to a control. In comparison to BHA (0. 02 %) the increase of PVs after the addition of ONEXT (0. 2 % and 0. 8 %) and USEXT (0. 8 %), respectively, was reduced. The oxidation of sunflower oil, treated with 0. 2 %, 0. 5 %, and 1. 0 % of ONEXT and USEXT, respectively, was tested using the Rancimat test at 120 °C. Both extracts increased the induction time compared to a control and BHA, and the stabilization factor F increased with the concentration. Se ha evaluado la actividad antioxidante de extractos metanólicos de torta de aceite de semilla de Sclerocarya birrea extraídos usando dos métodos diferentes. La extracción se llevó a cabo mediante agitación magnética del material en metanol/agua (80 : 20 v/v) durante toda la noche seguida de dos tratamientos con ultrasonidos durante 45 min. (extracto ONEXT) y solo tres tratamientos con ultrasonidos durante 45 min. (extracto USEXT), respectivamente. Se obtuvieron tres fracciones de cada extracto y el contenido total de compuestos fenólicos se determinó en cada fracción según el método de Folin-Ciocalteau como 34. 6, 54. 8 y 58. 6 mg/g de producto seco en ONEXT y 29. 6, 84. 8 y 143. 9 mg/g en USEXT, respectivamente. La actividad antioxidante de los extractos fue evaluada mediante el ensayo del β -carotenoácido linoleico donde los extractos y sus fracciones mostraron efectos significativos (p< 0. 05). Las propiedades antioxidantes de los extractos obtenidos mediante los dos métodos de extracción descritos fueron similares. El coeficiente de actividad antioxidante (AAC) de estos extractos y sus fracciones aumentó al aumentar la concentración del extracto. Se evaluó el efecto de ONEXT y USEXT, a niveles del 0, 2 y 0, 8 %, sobre la estabilidad oxidativa de aceite de girasol a 70 °C y en la oscuridad y se comparó con el antioxidante sintético comúnmente utilizado BHA. Los índices de peróxidos (PVs) fueron significativamente (p< 0. 05) más bajos con la adición de extracto en comparación con un control. En comparación con BHA (0. 02 %) el aumento de PVs después de la adición de ONEXT (0. 2 % y 0. 8 %) y USEXT (0. 8 %), respectivamente, se redujo. La oxidación del aceite de girasol tratado con 0. 2 %, 0. 5 %, y 1. 0 % de ONEXT y USEXT, respectivamente, fue probada usando el método Rancimat a 120 °C. En ambos extractos aumentó el periodo de inducción al compararlos con un control y BHA, y el factor de estabilización F aumentó con la concentración. </font...|$|E

The symptoms and post-mortem lesions suggest that the causal agent was probabl 7 a toxin(s from Aspergillus flavus. Soybean <b>oil</b> <b>meal</b> and the two sources of peanut <b>oil</b> <b>meal</b> wer supplemented with lysine, methionine and glyoine. Lysine was the first limiting amino acid in the peanut <b>oil</b> <b>meal.</b> Supplementat 1 oi,. of the peanut <b>oil</b> <b>meal</b> with the three amino acids resulted in growth rate almost as good as that of chicks on the soybean <b>oil</b> <b>meal</b> diet. Addition of amino acids to the toxic peanut 011 meal did not improve its quality nor decrease the high mortality. In the soybean <b>oil</b> <b>meal</b> diet, methionine was found to be the first limiting amino acid. Growth rate due to lysine, glycine or combinations of the three amino acids was lower than that due to methionine supplementation alone. In the last experiment, the peanut <b>oil</b> <b>meal</b> was supplemented with fish meal. Supplementation above 50 percent may probably not be economical under the conditions of this experiment. Regression of weight gain per unit of feed consumed on the three amino acids gave significant (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) coefficients of 0. 301, 0. 562 and 0. 350 for lysine, sulfur amino acids and glycine respectively.

(1954) have shown that the amino acid content of rapeseed protein is reasonably well balanced, commercial rapeseed <b>oil</b> <b>meal</b> has been shown (Blakely and Anderson, 1948; Kratzer et al., 1954; Klain et al., 1956) to be somewhat limiting in lysine. In addition it has been estab-lished (Astwood el al: 1949 a, b; Carroll, 1949) that rapeseed contains a goitrogen, L- 5 -vinyl- 2 -thiooxazolidone and possibly other toxic principles (Charipper an...|$|R
40|$|IT HAS been {{repeatedly}} observed, both at this station and by other workers, that optimal growth of chicks is not ob-tained on rations containing soybean <b>oil</b> <b>meal</b> {{as the principal}} protein source. Christiansen, Deobald, Halpin and Hart (1940) showed that diets containing soy-bean <b>oil</b> <b>meal</b> at levels providing appar-ently adequate quantities of protein would not support normal growth. These find-ings were confirmed by Carver and Evans (1943), by Berry, Carrick, Roberts, and Hauge (1943), by Hammond and Titus (1944) and more recently by other workers. Supplementation of such rations {{with a variety of}} natural products, in amounts sufficient to supply only relatively small amounts of additional protein, has been shown to result in marked improvement of growth. Because of the importance of these findings, studies were instituted at this station with the view of determining the effects of adding certain natural and synthetic materials to corn-soybean <b>oil</b> <b>meal</b> rations. The results of some of these experiments are reported here...|$|R
40|$|C OFFEE is {{the leading}} {{agricultural}} crop of Colombia, and often is pro-duced in excess of quantities needed to fill export demands. This has led to investiga-tions of alternative uses for coffee in addi-tion to its consumption as a beverage. Encouraging pilot studies {{have been based on}} the possible use of solvent ex-tracted coffee oil in food products. Analyti-cal data on coffee oil have revealed its com-position to be similar to other edible vege-table oils (Sivetz, 1963). However, since the coffee bean contains approximately 11 - 13 % oil, the solvent <b>extracted</b> residue, coffee <b>oil</b> <b>meal,</b> represents a considerable proportion of the original product. For more efficient utilization of surplus coffee, use must be made of the coffee <b>oil</b> <b>meal.</b> Although results have been published on the feeding of coffee by-products, particu-larly coffee pulp and grounds, to produc-tion animals (Martinez and Noel James, 1953; Hammond, 1944), little information is available on the nutritional value of coffee <b>oil</b> <b>meal.</b> Based on proximate anal-yses reported by Carew et al. (1966) and summarized in Table 1, coffee <b>oil</b> <b>meal</b> ap-pears adequate for consideration in animal feeding, although its fiber content would probably limit its usefulness in diets for most monogastric animals.

40|$|RINGROSE and Morgan (1938) re-> • ported that {{hydraulic}} {{cottonseed meal}} could replace {{one-half of the}} meat scraps in chick starter rations. Boatner et al. (1948) showed that chick growth was retarded by gossypol and related sub-stances in cottonseed meal. Clark et al. (1948) found solvent cottonseed meal to be slightly superior to hydraulic cotton-seed meal when fed to chicks. They also reported that equal parts of solvent or hy-draulic cottonseed <b>meal</b> with soybean <b>oil</b> <b>meal</b> gave results similar to that obtained with soybean <b>oil</b> <b>meal</b> alone. Lillie and Bird (1950) concluded from their studies that the toxicity of cottonseed pigment glands fed to chicks daily by capsule was due entirely to the gossypol content of the glands. Richardson and Blaylock (1950 a) obtained rapid growth in young chickens fed a diet which contained cot-tonseed meal as {{the only source of}} protein, when the diet was supplemented with vi-tamin B 12 and synthetic lysine. Richard-son and Blaylock (1950 b) found that mix-tures of soybean <b>oil</b> <b>meal</b> and cottonseed meal were unsatisfactory for poults, com-pared to an all-soybean <b>oil</b> <b>meal</b> diet. No proteins of animal origin were used in these diets.

40|$|Modern {{agriculture}} {{is in need}} of alternative methods of pest control due to a rise in pest resistance and growing demand for organic crops. Brassicaceae seed <b>meal</b> <b>extracts</b> show potential as natural pesticides, and are more consistent and manageable than using Brassicaceae seed meal itself. In Oriental (Brassica juncea L.) mustard, the glucosinolate sinigrin hydrolyzes to produce the biologically active compound 2 -propenyl isothiocyanate, which can be used to control nematodes and other soil pests. Due to the extraction process, the mustard <b>meal</b> <b>extract</b> requires formulation with myrosinase enzyme from mustard meal, a buffer, and ascorbic acid to facilitate the hydrolysis reaction and formation of 2 -propenyl isothiocyanate. We are researching how to formulate the mustard <b>meal</b> <b>extract</b> for optimal release of active pesticidal compounds when applied to varying soil types. The 2 -propenyl isothiocyanate is unstable and difficult to quantify in the soil environment, so we have researched alternative methods of quantifying product formation via an enzymatic assay and ion chromatography. Methods for producing and drying the powdered mustard <b>meal</b> <b>extract</b> are being analyzed as well as optimization of the added myrosinase, buffer, and ascorbic acid to result in an effective extract formulation with the potential for organic certification...|$|R
40|$|CORN and soybean <b>oil</b> <b>meal</b> are {{the major}} sources of amino acids in high energy laying diets. When the protein level of such diets is altered, the amino acid pattern is altered {{simultaneously}} due to the shift in the relative amounts of protein originating from corn and soybean <b>oil</b> <b>meal.</b> For this reason data regarding the optimum combination of corn and soybean protein would be pertinent to the interpretation of experiments concerned with levels of pro-tein. Almquist and Grau (1944) fed graded combinations of soybean and sesame pro-tein to chicks in isonitrogenous diets and found that a sesame-soybean protein ratio...|$|R

By virtue of its conditioning effects and protein content, it is widely used in the feeding of larger animals including swine. In the latter case, meat meal or tankage is used as an additional protein supplement. In poultry rations however, even after the inclusion of animal protein supplements in amounts and of a quality normally considered adequate, {{it has not been}} possible to use linseed <b>oil</b> <b>meal</b> to any appreciable extent without inferior growth results...|$|R
40|$|Swine {{experiment}} I, page 43, {{reported the}} results of feeding mustard seed <b>oil</b> <b>meal</b> to fattening pigs on alfalfa pasture, when mixed with tankage and other protein supplements. Pigs were fed with protein supplement mixtures in which the mustard seed <b>oil</b> <b>meal</b> composed as much as 50 percent of the supplement. The results of feeding it in such large proportions were so satisfactory that it was desired to ascertain whether it were possible to increase further the amount of mustard seed meal in the mixture with tankage and still get good results. Consequently two lots of pigs were fed with an increased percentage of mustard seed <b>oil</b> <b>meal.</b> In addition last year in connection with some other studies there was produced at the Kansas Experiment Station some dehydrated brome grass meal. This meal had a protein content of about 20. 9 percent. As there was no information at hand concerning the use and palatability of brome grass meal in swine feeding, it was thought advisable to compare it with dehydrated alfalfa meal...|$|R
40|$|In {{the poultry}} industry, several {{alternative}} methods for disposal of dead birds have been developed. This study evaluated {{the efficacy of}} a dehydrated poultry mortality-soybean meal (DPSM) product, made from 60 % on-farm whole dead birds, 40 % soybean <b>oil</b> <b>meal,</b> and a preservative amendment, for inclusion in broiler diets. Composite samples of the DPSM product were obtained for nutritional and microbiological analysis. A subsequent 42 -d broiler growout experiment was conducted using DPSM incrementally (0 to 100 %) substituted for the protein source component (i. e., soybean <b>oil</b> <b>meal)</b> in starter and grower diets. Nutritionally, the DPSM product was similar to soybean <b>oil</b> <b>meal</b> (SBOM), with approximately 51. 5 % CP, 2. 81 % Lys, 0. 72 % Met, 1. 85 % Thr, 3. 14 % Arg, and 1. 36 % TSAA. True amino acid digestibilities of DPSM, however, were higher than soybean <b>oil</b> <b>meal.</b> Likewise, crude fat (18. 03 %) and ash (8. 00 %) concentrations of DPSM were higher than those typically observed for SBOM. Although at low levels, 13 genera of bacteria (including some pathogenic organisms) were isolated from the DPSM product. When replacing SBOM in broiler starter and grower diets, DPSM, at lower, more practical replacement rates, did not significantly influence body weight, feed consumption, or feed conversion. According {{to the results of}} this study, using DPSM in partial substitution for SBOM in broiler diets was a safe, efficient, and economically feasible alternative for dead bird disposal.
