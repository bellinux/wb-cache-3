5|$|There was {{considerable}} debate whether pterosaurs ambulated as quadrupeds or as bipeds. In the 1980s, paleontologist Kevin Padian suggested that smaller pterosaurs with longer hindlimbs, such as Dimorphodon, might have walked or even run bipedally, {{in addition to}} flying, like road runners. However, {{a large number of}} pterosaur trackways were later found with a distinctive four-toed hind foot and three-toed front foot; these are the unmistakable prints of pterosaurs walking <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>fours.</b>|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{appearances}} in movies, Iguanodon {{has also been}} featured on the television documentary miniseries Walking with Dinosaurs (1999) produced by the BBC, and played a starring role in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's book, The Lost World as well as featuring in an episode of the Discovery Channel documentary, Dinosaur Planet (incorrectly portrayed being able to run <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>fours</b> and living in the Late Cretaceous). It also was present in Bob Bakker's Raptor Red (1995), as a Utahraptor prey item. A main belt asteroid, , has been named 9941 Iguanodon in honour of the genus.|$|E
5|$|By 1916 Frederick Warne & Co had {{discontinued}} Miss Moppet in its panorama format, and republished {{the story}} in a book format that year. Potter illustrated a frontispiece of the kitten and mouse seated in profile, and a title page vignette of a mouse <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>fours</b> facing the reader for the book format. At , the book's dimensions were smaller than other Peter Rabbit books. In 1917, she suggested to her publisher that Appley Dapply's Nursery Rhymes {{be published in the}} smaller Miss Moppet format.|$|E

5|$|He {{played in}} all four of England's games at the 1962 FIFA World Cup in Chile, scoring one goal in the 3–1 victory over Argentina before playing in the quarter-final defeat to Brazil. During the defeat to Brazil a stray dog ran onto the pitch and evaded all of the players' efforts to catch it until Greaves got down <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>fours</b> to beckon the animal. The Brazilian player Garrincha thought the {{incident}} was so amusing that he took the dog home as a pet.|$|E
5|$|During his {{re-examination}} of Iguanodon, David Norman {{was able}} to show that this posture was unlikely, because the long tail was stiffened with ossified tendons. To get the tripodal pose, the tail would literally have to be broken. Putting the animal in a horizontal posture makes many aspects of the arms and pectoral girdle more understandable. For example, the hand is relatively immobile, with the three central fingers grouped together, bearing hoof-like phalanges, and able to hyperextend. This would have allowed them to bear weight. The wrist is also relatively immobile, and the arms and shoulder bones robust. These features all suggest that the animal spent time <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>fours.</b>|$|E
5|$|Large three-toed {{footprints}} {{are known}} in Early Cretaceous rocks of England, particularly Wealden beds on the Isle of Wight, and these trace fossils were originally difficult to interpret. Some authors associated them with dinosaurs early on. In 1846, E. Tagert {{went so far}} as to assign them to an ichnogenus he named Iguanodon, and Samuel Beckles noted in 1854 that they looked like bird tracks, but might have come from dinosaurs. The identity of the trackmakers was greatly clarified upon the discovery in 1857 of the hind leg of a young Iguanodon, with distinctly three-toed feet, showing that such dinosaurs could have made the tracks. Despite the lack of direct evidence, these tracks are often attributed to Iguanodon. A trackway in England shows what may be an Iguanodon moving <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>fours,</b> but the foot prints are poor, making a direct connection difficult. Tracks assigned to the ichnogenus Iguanodon are known from locations including places in Europe where the body fossil Iguanodon is known, to Spitsbergen, Svalbard, Norway.|$|E

5|$|Potter {{either had}} no live {{models for the}} eastern {{chipmunk}} characters, or borrowed a pet chipmunk from a cousin. Initially, {{she may have been}} unsure of how to draw the chipmunks and chose to clothe them, then was forced to follow suit and clothe the two main players as well, while leaving the other squirrels in their natural state. Or, she may have clothed Timmy and Goody because they collect their nuts in sacks (an unnatural way for squirrels to behave) in imitation of a ruse she employed in Peter Rabbit when Peter only walks on his hind legs while wearing his blue jacket. When he loses his jacket, he reverts to being an animal and moves about <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>fours.</b> Because Timmy and Chippy were not drawn from nature, the two suggest stuffed animals in their lack of engaging facial expressions.|$|E
5|$|Fighting {{techniques}} differ {{amongst the}} bovid families and also {{depend on their}} build. While the hartebeest fight on knees, others usually fight <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>fours.</b> Gazelles of various sizes use different methods of combat. Gazelles usually box, and in serious fights may clash and fence, consisting of hard blows from short range. Ibex, goat and sheep males stand upright and clash into each other downwards. Wildebeest use powerful head butting in aggressive clashes. If horns become entangled, the opponents move in a circular manner to unlock them. Muskoxen will ram into each other at high speeds. As a rule, only two bovids of equal build and level of defence engage in a fight, which is intended to determine the superior of the two. Individuals that are evidently inferior to others would rather flee than fight; for example, immature males do not fight with the mature bulls. Generally, bovids direct their attacks on the opponent's head rather than its body. The S-shaped horns, such as those on the impala, have various sections that help in ramming, holding, and stabbing. Serious fights leading to injury are rare.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Madonna {{collaborated with}} {{photographer}} Steven Klein for an art installation project called X-Static Process. The installation portrayed Madonna in different incarnations of her spiritual practices– from yogi, prophet, queen to freak and pole dancer. The publication was a worldwide success, {{leading to a}} number of exhibitions in New York, London, Paris, Düsseldorf, Berlin and Florence. After the exhibition was over, Madonna was inspired by the images from the exhibitions and decided to incorporate them into her then unplanned tour and asked Klein to help her with the task. She then began developing her sixth concert tour called Re-Invention World Tour. The poster released for the tour used one of the images from the installation project. It featured Madonna in a seventeenth-century-style dress, crawling <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>fours</b> towards the camera. The central theme of the show was unity versus violence. It was divided into five acts with different themes: French Baroque-Marie Antionette Revival, Military-Army, Circus-Cabaret, Acoustic and Scottish-Tribal segments. During the Q Awards, Elton John accused Madonna for lip-synching in her shows which gained great controversy but was denied by Madonna's representatives. Although musician Prince's Musicology Live 2004ever tour was initially projected to be the highest grossing tour of 2004, Billboard Boxscore published that the Re-Invention Tour had sold 55 out of the 56 shows and grossed $125 million. At the 2004 Billboard Touring Awards, Re-Invention Tour received the Top Tour while Madonna's tour manager Caresse Henry was awarded the Top Manager award. A documentary, titled I'm Going to Tell You a Secret, which chronicled the tour, was released in 2005.|$|E

25|$|August Goldfuss {{depicted}} pterosaurs as flying reptiles {{that used}} their wing claws to climb cliffs. He hypothesized that on land, {{they would have}} had to travel <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>fours.</b> He also suggested that they may have been covered in hair.|$|E
25|$|Stokes {{described}} the new ichnogenus and species Pteraichnus saltwashensis from the Late Jurassic Morrison Formation of Utah, USA, interpreting them as pterosaur tracks. Stokes reported {{the presence of}} an impression left by the putative pterosaurian trackmaker's wing finger, although this claim is probably mistaken. If his identification of these tracks was correct, it would mean that pterosaurs walked <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>fours.</b>|$|E
25|$|Various {{aspects of}} {{pterosaur}} biology invited controversy from the beginning. Samuel Thomas von Soemmering ignited a multi-century {{debate over how}} pterosaurs walked on the ground by suggesting they crawled <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>fours</b> like bats. August Quenstedt, by contrast, argued that they walked on their hind limbs. In the early 20th century, Hankin and Watson in the first major study of pterosaur flight biomechanics concluded that on the ground these reptiles were altogether helpless and could only scoot along on their stomachs like penguins. The debate gained steam in 1957 when William Stokes reported unusual tracks left by a four-footed animal he suspected was a pterosaur walking along the ground. In 1984, Kevin Padian, who had recently argued that pterosaurs walked on their hind legs, dismissed Stokes's tracks as those of a crocodilian. However, in the mid-1990s, Jean-Michel Mazin and others reported that fossil footprints in Crayssac, France {{were similar to those}} reported by Stokes from the US. Mazin's tracks were more obviously pterosaurian in origin and settled the debate in favor of pterosaurs walking <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>fours.</b>|$|E
