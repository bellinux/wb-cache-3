In recent decades several Glacier Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) have occurred, which have resulted in destruction of land and infrastructure for several tens of kilometres down valley. As a result, the growth of supra-glacial lakes {{is considered to be a}} potential hazard to human lives and livelihoods. Therefore, there is a need for better understanding of the factors involved in lake emergence and subsequent evolution, in order to prepare for and alleviate future GLOF events. On the basis of the above premise, a detailed study of one glacier in the region, the Ngozumpa, was undertaken. The specific objectives of the study were to: 1)   study initial lake inception;  2)   understand glacial lake development cycles;  3)  monitor lake development rates; and   4)   provide a baseline for future glaciological studies on the Ngozumpa Glacier. It was found that certain criteria are requisite for glacial lake formation, and that the evolution of lakes on the glacier is controlled by the englacial base level. Two types of lake exist on the Ngozumpa; 1) ‘Perched Lakes’, occupying closed basins above the englacial water table, and 2) lakes controlled by the altitude of outflow through the lateral moraine. A single example of the second <b>type,</b> <b>Spillway</b> Lake, currently exists on the Ngozumpa.

The multi-sources generation mechanisms are first proposed basing on the prototype observation results, vortex sound model, turbulent flow model and acoustic numerical model.

The results of the analyses reveal that the submerged jets in the plunge pool only contribute to an on-site LFN energy of 0 – 1. 0 Hz, and the strong shear layers around the high-velocity submerged jets and wall jet development areas are the main acoustic source regions of LFN in the plunge pool. In addition, the nappe-cavity coupled vibration, which is induced when the discharge nappe vibrates with close frequency to the model frequency of the cavity, can induce on-site LFN energy with wider frequency spectrum energy within 0 – 4. 0 Hz.

The construction of check dams in debris-flow valleys is considered a useful strategy for mitigating the damages downstream. In this paper, a new <b>type</b> of <b>spillway</b> structure with lateral contraction was proposed to distribute debris flows after the check dam storage filled up. Four different lateral contraction ratios of the spillway were considered in experiments that investigated debris-flow patterns, scour characteristics, and energy dissipation rates when debris flows passed through the spillway. The results indicated that lateral contraction considerably influenced the extension of debris-flow nappes. The drop length of the nappe at η  [*]=[*]  0. 7 (η  means lateral contraction ratio) was approximately 1. 4  times larger than at η  [*]=[*]  0. 4. The collision, friction, and mixing forces between the debris-flow nappes and debris flows in downstream plunge pools dissipated much of the debris-flow kinetic energy, ranging from 42. 03  to 78. 08...|$|R
