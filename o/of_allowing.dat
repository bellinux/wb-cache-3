30|$|The {{level of}} rigidities of {{external}} agents (namely, local residents and firms) in modifying the rate <b>of</b> <b>allowed</b> {{immigrants in the}} city (specific for each municipality) is captured by the constant parameter γ (> 0) 10, which reflects a marginal, increasing, and convex disutility cost in {{the rate at which}} the change in the number <b>of</b> <b>allowed</b> immigrants takes place. In this setting, the (stock) variable of the number <b>of</b> <b>allowed</b> immigrants might constitute a sluggish control variable since, as mentioned above, the variable over which the municipal authority has a better and direct control is represented by the the rate of change in the flow <b>of</b> <b>allowed</b> immigrants; therefore, following the approach suggested by Feichtinger et al. (1994), I assume that the rate of change in the flow <b>of</b> <b>allowed</b> immigrants would constitute a better control variable rather than its stock.|$|R

5|$|After {{six innings}} <b>of</b> <b>allowing</b> no earned runs – {{which gave him}} a total of 13 innings against the Yankees and Cardinals with only one earned run allowed on a torn ankle tendon – Schilling made way for Alan Embree, who pitched a {{scoreless}} seventh. Mike Timlin replaced Embree in the eighth, in which a sacrifice fly by Scott Rolen reduced the Red Sox lead to four. Keith Foulke then came in to strike out Jim Edmonds to end the inning and also pitched the ninth to end the game. For the second game in a row, the Red Sox won despite committing four fielding errors.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the late}} 1960s, fires were {{generally}} {{believed to be}} detrimental for parks and forests, and management policies were aimed at suppressing fires as quickly as possible. However, as the beneficial ecological role of fire became better understood in the decades before 1988, a policy was adopted <b>of</b> <b>allowing</b> natural fires to burn under controlled conditions, which proved highly successful in reducing the area lost annually to wildfires.|$|E

Edward died two years later, leaving a widow and infant daughter. Holding the {{position}} of comptroller of the Duchess of Kent's household for the next nineteen years, Conroy also acted as her confidant and political agent, among other roles. Together, they designed the Kensington System, an elaborate and strict system of rules for the upbringing of young Victoria, designed to render her weak-willed and utterly dependent upon them in the hope <b>of</b> <b>allowing</b> them one day to wield power through her.|$|E

Liepert blamed their departures on better offers from other employers, although New Democrat leader Brian Mason speculated that the government's health restructuring may have been to blame.

5|$|In November 2008, SMRT Corporation and Land Transport Authority (LTA) {{announced}} that the last ten refurbished trainsets would have one-third of their seats replaced with metal rails to create extra standing space. The move was justified on grounds <b>of</b> <b>allowing</b> more standing space onboard during peak-hour services. The reduction of seats per row from nine to seven after refurbishment was already unpopular among commuters; the decision to further reduce seating capacity drew sharp criticism against the operator and LTA. As of December 2015, all 66 C151s from one-third of their seats {{have been replaced by}} metal bars to create extra standing space.|$|E

5|$|In The Political Demands of Isolated Indian Bands in British Columbia, Thomson {{points out}} the {{benefits}} in some level (albeit small) of separatist policies. He argues the benefits <b>of</b> <b>allowing</b> ethnic groups, like the Amish and the Hutterites in the United States and Canada or the Sami in Norway, {{to live on the}} edges of governance. These are ethnic groups that would prefer to retain their ethnic identity and thus prefer separatist policies for themselves, as they do not require them to conform to policies for all ethnicities of the nation.|$|E

5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, some Protestant Christians {{moved from a}} {{position}} <b>of</b> <b>allowing</b> moderate use of alcohol (sometimes called moderationism) to either deciding that not imbibing was wisest in the present circumstances (abstentionism) or prohibiting all ordinary consumption of alcohol because it {{was believed to be}} a sin (prohibitionism). Many Protestant churches, particularly Methodists and Evangelical groups, advocated abstentionism and were early leaders in the temperance movement of the 19th and 20th centuries. Today, all three positions exist in Christianity, but the historic position remains the most common worldwide, due to the adherence by the largest bodies of Christians, namely Anglicanism, Roman Catholicism, and Eastern Orthodoxy.|$|E
