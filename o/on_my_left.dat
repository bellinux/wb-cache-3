25|$|I congratulated Michel {{and then}} sat down. <b>On</b> <b>my</b> <b>left</b> was Guttierez, trying to provide a sample for the doctor, while Pollentier was in the other corner. They both had {{difficulty}} in urinating... Suddenly, the doctor cried out: 'What are you doing?' to Guttierez. I looked round and saw there was some urine in the Frenchman's test flask and a small plastic tube in his hand. He was confused and tried to say the tube {{had been in his}} pocket. I was overcome with surprise and thought 'I'm glad he isn't one of my team'. But then, about a minute later, panic returned when the doctor pulled down Pollentier's shorts and revealed this plastic tube which you all now know about.|$|E

60|$|There was not {{a branch}} above me that I could break, but a few feet below was a slender, dead limb. I slid down and got it, and, holding <b>on</b> with <b>my</b> <b>left</b> arm and legs, I began to thrash the cub. He growled fiercely. snapped at the stick, and began to back down.|$|R

2500|$|In December 2005, Geldof {{agreed to}} give advice on global poverty to the Conservative Party. [...] He stated, however, that he was uninterested in party politics, and would {{continue}} to 'shake hands with the devil <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>left</b> and the devil on my right,' {{in order to achieve}} results.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{have only}} two men out of my company and 20 out of some other company. We need support, but it is almost suicide {{to try to get}} it here as we are swept by machine gun fire and a {{constant}} barrage is on us. I have no one <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>left</b> and only a few on my right. I will hold." ...|$|E
60|$|I spun <b>on</b> <b>my</b> {{heel and}} <b>left</b> him, {{nor did he}} follow; and a great lump was in my throat and tears welling in my eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, as {{a matter}} of fact, he didn't seem any too keen <b>on</b> <b>my</b> company. I <b>left</b> him in the locker-room chewing a cigar. Gave me the {{impression}} of having something on his mind." ...|$|R
60|$|I was {{too much}} disgusted to reply--I turned <b>on</b> <b>my</b> heel, and <b>left</b> him in silence. There was an up train at {{two o'clock in the}} afternoon, and by that train I {{returned}} to London.|$|R
2500|$|... "Blood Roses", which Amos had {{initially}} intended {{to serve as}} the opening track to the album, finds the singer scorned over a failed relationship, belting out lines such as, [...] "can't forget the things you never said" [...] and [...] "I've shaved every place where you've been boy". Regarding [...] "Caught a Lite Sneeze", Amos says, [...] "the whole current is doing anything so that you don't have to face yourself. Nothing is enough"; her previous relationships with men being the song's backbone with lines like, [...] "boys <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>left</b> side, boys on my right side, boys in the middle and you're not here, I need a big loan from the girl zone." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album's {{cover is}} {{a photo of}} Amos holding a large rifle, sitting {{in a rocking chair}} on the porch of an old wooden building. One of her legs is out of her pants and flung {{over the side of the}} chair. A snake coils around the chair and a large rooster hangs from the roof of the porch. The image is a nod to her song [...] "Me and a Gun," [...] which appears on the album Little Earthquakes and recounts a rape she sustained. [...] "Well, it's [...] a {{reference}} to Me and a Gun, a song I wrote that was on Little Earthquakes. And the idea that there's a dead cock on my right and alive snake <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>left.</b> And the idea is that death and life... creation... what it's taken me to get here with men, and I don't want to be angry anymore. And you turn it over and you put the gun down, but I'm not pretending what it's taken to get me here. But no more resentment." [...] It was taken by Cindy Palmano in October 1995 in New Orleans.|$|E
2500|$|A bizarre moment {{occurred}} in round 8, whilst in a headlock, Maidana {{appeared to have}} bitten Mayweather's left hand. Mayweather explained this in the post fight, [...] "I didn't know what it was. Something happened and then my fingers were numb. After the eighth round my fingers were numb. I could only use my other hand. He bit me. I realized he bit me. We were tangled {{in the middle of}} the ring and all of a sudden I felt something <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>left</b> hand." [...] Maidana denied the bite, [...] "Maybe he thinks I'm a dog, but I never bit him. He was rubbing my eyes that round. He may have had his glove in my mouth, but I never bit him." [...] After round 9, Maidana appeared to be confused as he started walking towards the wrong corner. Mayweather immediately ran towards him to point to his corner, much to the amusement of the crowd. Maidana was unhappy with the final verdict and thought he won the fight, [...] "If the judges want to give the fight to fighters that run, they can give it to him. I was attacking all the time. Maybe I'm wrong, but I thought that I was the aggressor. I kept my plan to be aggressive but he kept holding and pushing. I don't want to waste my time with a third fight. I trained with all my heart to get this type of result. This is not fair. There's not reason for another fight." [...] For the sequel, Mayweather earned a minimum of $32 million and Maidana earned a career high $3 million.|$|E
60|$|Without bestowing {{upon him}} another look, I turned <b>on</b> <b>my</b> heel and <b>left</b> the room. I had set <b>my</b> foot <b>on</b> the stair, when I heard {{the rustle of}} a dress, and the low voice which I knew so well calling my name.|$|R
6000|$|A {{score of}} retorts, all deliciously inadvisable, tickled my tongue, so I said nothing, contenting myself with holding <b>on</b> with <b>my</b> <b>left</b> hand while I nursed my {{stinging}} right hand under my arm-pit. Beyond her, {{across the floor}} of the main cabin, I saw the steward in pursuit of Captain West's Bible and a sheaf of Miss West's music. And as she gurgled and laughed at me, beholding her in this intimacy of storm, the thought flashed through my brain: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, but {{you shall}} march {{with your arms}} bound until we are there, and the fight wi' the redskins is over," [...] said the robber-chief, [...] "and if I find treachery in your acts or looks I'll blow your brains out <b>on</b> the spot. <b>My</b> <b>left</b> hand, you shall find, can {{work as well as}} the right wi' the revolver." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You, Miss Lenora," [...] he said, [...] "will please sit <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>left,</b> and you, Miss Laura, on my right. Mr. Quest, {{will you}} sit {{on the other side}} of Miss Laura, and Mr. Harris two places down <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>left.</b> There is an old lady who expects to be at the table, but the steward tells me she hasn't been in yet." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{design of}} Star Fleet Battles began during 1975... Jim Brown... and I {{were playing a}} lot of Jutland.... One {{afternoon}} I was studying the Jutland battle that was in progress <b>on</b> <b>my</b> floor (<b>left</b> from the previous evening) when the [...] re-run of the day came on. I began {{to consider the possibility}} of doing a space game on the Jutland system. JagdPanther was in operation at the time, and I had vague thoughts that I could somehow get a license for the game.|$|R
2500|$|The {{regiment}} {{had been}} raised for service the Jacobite rising of 1689, and {{was present at the}} final Battle of Dunkeld in August of that year; here, it fortified the town and held off a strong force of Highlanders. Blackadder himself was uninjured, despite [...] "several falling <b>on</b> <b>my</b> right and <b>left</b> hand".|$|R
60|$|But I turned <b>on</b> <b>my</b> {{heel and}} <b>left</b> him. That was the last. I could stand it no longer. The thing must end right there, I thought, curse him! The earth should be quit of him. And as I {{went over the}} hill, I could hear his monstrous laugh reverberating against the sky.|$|R

6000|$|My {{own opinion}} is that Shakspere did [...] "know Latin pretty well," [...] and was no SCHOLAR, as his contemporaries {{reckoned}} scholarship. He left school, if tradition speak true, by a year later than the age, twelve, when Bacon went to Cambridge. Will, a clever kind of lad (<b>on</b> <b>my</b> theory), <b>left</b> school {{at an age when}} some other clever lads became freshmen. Why not? Gilbert Burnet (of whom you may have heard as Bishop of Salisbury under William III) took his degree at the age of fourteen.|$|R
60|$|I {{arrived at}} Mount Sharon; was {{received}} by my friends there with their wonted kindness; and after {{being a little}} rallied <b>on</b> <b>my</b> having suddenly <b>left</b> them on the preceding evening, I agreed to make atonement by staying all night, and dismissed the lad who attended with my fishing-rod, to carry that information to Shepherd's Bush. It may be doubted whether he went thither, or in a different direction.|$|R
5000|$|Jim Walker (2001): “Once {{during a}} break I stayed <b>on</b> <b>my</b> kit, you know, fooling around, when {{suddenly}} Keith jumped up and shouted to me to repeat {{whatever it was that}} Id been playing. It was just some hi-hat thing. Id always focused <b>on</b> developing <b>my</b> <b>left</b> hand side, in other words my hi-hat side. Anyway, I repeated it. Wobble instinctively came up with the perfect bassline part. Then Keith, who had heard exactly what he wanted through the thing Id started, played the most blistering guitar part I think I ever heard him play. That was how PIL wrote: through the subconscious. That song ended up being named You Stupid Person. It was meant to be our second single. ... It was actually a lot better than Public Image. It would have been impossible to keep from being a number one hit, and probably would have broke us in America all by itself. We managed to demo it, Ive still got a copy.” ...|$|R
60|$|Our {{conversation}} had lasted {{but a few}} seconds, and an instant after I was on my way, the lantern <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>left</b> arm and the pistol in my right hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Can {{you move}} the table, mademoiselle?" [...] he asked her. [...] "Try to drag it here, {{to the wall}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>left,</b> {{as close to the}} door as you can bring it." ...|$|E
60|$|Starbottle. The lady on {{my right}} is--er--the niece of your father,--your cousin. The lady <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>left,</b> engaged in {{soothing}} the--er--bashful timidity of infancy, is--er--that is--er--claims to be, {{the mother of the}} child of Alexander Morton.|$|E
60|$|I did not, of course, wait to {{hear any}} more of that abominable talk. I sped home as fast as my old legs would carry me. That self-same evening, {{as soon as it}} was dark, Mme. la Marquise, {{carrying}} M. le Vicomte in her arms and I carrying a pack with a few necessaries <b>on</b> <b>my</b> back, <b>left</b> the ancestral home of the Mortaines never to return to it again: for within an hour of our flight a detachment of the revolutionary army made a descent upon the chateau; they ransacked it from attic to cellar, and finding nothing there to satisfy their lust of hate, they burned the stately mansion down to the ground.|$|R
6000|$|... "Granted {{that it was}} her own fault, if you please. But {{surely you}} have punished her enough by your long seclusion, and can afford to shew a tardy magnanimity by this time. There she is, I think, just come in at the door <b>on</b> the <b>left.</b> <b>My</b> sight is so wretched. Is it not she?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps you've a {{right to}} say that you left it a little to mine." [...] Mixed up with the spoils there, rising before him as if she were in a manner their keeper, she felt that she must {{absolutely}} dissociate herself. Mrs. Gereth had made it impossible to do anything but give her away. [...] "I can only tell you that, <b>on</b> <b>my</b> side, I <b>left</b> it to her. I never dreamed either that she would pick out so many things." ...|$|R
