5|$|Short-period comets have orbits lasting {{less than}} two hundred years. Long-period comets have orbits lasting {{thousands}} of years. Short-period comets are thought to <b>originate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Kuiper belt, whereas long-period comets, such as Hale–Bopp, are thought to <b>originate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Oort cloud. Many comet groups, such as the Kreutz Sungrazers, formed from the breakup of a single parent. Some comets with hyperbolic orbits may originate outside the Solar System, but determining their precise orbits is difficult. Old comets that have had most of their volatiles driven out by solar warming are often categorised as asteroids.|$|E
5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma, {{also known}} as bile duct cancer, {{is a form of}} cancer that is {{composed}} of mutated epithelial cells (or cells showing characteristics of epithelial differentiation) that <b>originate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bile ducts which drain bile from the liver into the small intestine. Other biliary tract cancers include gallbladder cancer and cancer of the ampulla of Vater.|$|E
5|$|Comets {{usually have}} highly {{eccentric}} elliptical orbits, {{and they have}} a wide range of orbital periods, ranging from several years to potentially several millions of years. Short-period comets <b>originate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Kuiper belt or its associated scattered disc, which lie beyond the orbit of Neptune. Long-period comets are thought to <b>originate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Oort cloud, a spherical cloud of icy bodies extending from outside the Kuiper belt to halfway to the nearest star. Long-period comets are set in motion towards the Sun from the Oort cloud by gravitational perturbations caused by passing stars and the galactic tide. Hyperbolic comets may pass once through the inner Solar System before being flung to interstellar space. The appearance of a comet is called an apparition.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Comparing the {{epidemiology}} of fractures <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cervical and apical regions {{may help}} to understand the causes and risk of a vertical root fracture. We aimed to determine the frequency of vertical root fractures in different fracture sites and how the fracture site relates to fracture direction and post length. Methods: Teeth diagnosed with a vertical root fracture were retrospectively surveyed for age and sex of the patient, type of tooth, a fracture region <b>in</b> <b>the</b> longitudinal axial direction, site of the fracture, and presence of a post <b>The</b> fracture region <b>in</b> <b>the</b> longitudinal axial direction was classified as an incomplete fracture, complete fracture, and uncertain. Incomplete fractures were further classified into a fracture <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cervical region, a fracture <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> midregion, and a fracture <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> apical region. Posts were evaluated by loss of post and length of post. Results: Fractures <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cervical and apical region occurred around the same frequency, whereas fractures <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> midregion were extremely scarce. Of <b>the</b> fractures <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cervical region, 36. 2 % were in a mesial and/or distal site and 57. 4 % in a buccal and/or lingual site. Of <b>the</b> fractures <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> apical region, 90. 8 % were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> buccal and/ or lingual site. The {{number of cases of}} fractures <b>Originating</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> apical region decreased with increased post length. Conclusions: Sites of fracture and post length differed greatly between fractures <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cervical region and the apical region, suggesting that risk factors for fractures <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cervical and apical regions are different...|$|R

The sternocleidomastoid muscle tilts and rotates the head, while the trapezius muscle, connecting to the scapula, acts to shrug the shoulder.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Jordan's radio stations {{are based in}} Amman. The first radio station to <b>originate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city was Hunna Amman in 1959; it mainly broadcast traditional Bedouin music. In 2000, Amman Net became the first de facto private radio station to be established in the country, despite private ownership of radio stations being illegal at the time. After private ownership was legalized in 2002, several more radio stations were created. There were eight registered radio stations broadcasting from Amman by 2007. Most English language stations play pop music targeted towards young audiences.|$|E

5|$|Arizona {{has been}} {{affected}} by hurricanes on numerous occasions. Usually, these storms <b>originate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eastern Pacific Ocean, make landfall in the Mexican states of Baja California or Sonora, and dissipate before crossing into the United States. Thus, in most cases, {{it is only the}} tropical cyclones' remnant moisture that produces heavy rainfall—and in some occasions, flooding—in portions of Arizona. However, approximately every five years, a tropical cyclone retains sufficient strength to enter the state as a tropical storm or a tropical depression. Arizonans can expect indirect flash floods caused by the remnants of tropical cyclones to occur about every two years.|$|E
5|$|Comets can loosely {{be divided}} into two {{categories}}: short-period and long-period—the latter being thought to <b>originate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Oort cloud. The two major categories of short-period comets are Jupiter-family comets (JFCs) and Halley-type comets. Halley-type comets, which are named after their prototype, Halley's Comet, are thought to have originated in the Oort cloud but to have been drawn into the inner Solar System by the gravity of the giant planets, whereas the JFCs are thought to have originated in the scattered disc. The centaurs are thought to be a dynamically intermediate stage between the scattered disc and the Jupiter family.|$|E
5|$|Females {{have two}} {{openings}} located under {{the edge of}} the mantle in the mantle cavity: the opening of the vagina and an opening for laying eggs. The vagina accepts the sperm during copulation. The vagina is connected to the bursa copulatrix and to the spermatheca (for storing sperm). The other opening is for laying eggs. Egg cells <b>originate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ovary. Egg cells travel through the oviduct to the fertilization chamber, where fertilization occur. Eggs then develop in the glandular uterus. A capsule is formed in the diverticulum next to the uterus. The eggs are then laid.|$|E

5|$|Few at {{the time}} {{realized}} how important the issue would become, with {{the absence of a}} bill of rights becoming the main argument of the anti-Federalists against ratification. Most of the Convention's delegates thought that states already protected individual rights, and that the Constitution did not authorize the national government to take away rights, so {{there was no need to}} include protections of rights. Once the Convention moved beyond this point, the delegates addressed a couple of last-minute issues. Importantly, they modified the language that required spending bills to <b>originate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Representatives and be flatly accepted or rejected, unmodified, by the Senate. The new language empowered the Senate to modify spending bills proposed by the House.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to relatively long-wavelength radiation, Jupiter also emits synchrotron radiation (also {{known as the}} Jovian decimetric radiation or DIM radiation) with frequencies {{in the range of}} 0.1–15GHz (wavelength from 3m to 2cm), which is the bremsstrahlung radiation of the relativistic electrons trapped in the inner radiation belts of the planet. The energy of the electrons that contribute to the DIM emissions is from 0.1 to 100MeV, while the leading contribution comes from the electrons with energy in the range 1–20MeV. This radiation is well understood and was used {{since the beginning of the}} 1960s to study the structure of the planet's magnetic field and radiation belts. The particles in the radiation belts <b>originate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> outer magnetosphere and are adiabatically accelerated, when they are transported to the inner magnetosphere.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to endometrial carcinomas, the uncommon endometrial stromal sarcomas are cancers that <b>originate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> non-glandular connective tissue of the endometrium. They are generally non-aggressive and, if they recur, can take decades. Metastases to the lungs and pelvic or peritoneal cavities {{are the most}} frequent. They typically have estrogen and/or progesterone receptors. The prognosis for low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma is good, with 60–90% five-year survival. High-grade undifferentiated endometrial sarcoma (HGUS) has a worse prognosis, with high rates of recurrence and 25% five-year survival. HGUS prognosis is dictated by {{whether or not the}} cancer has invaded the arteries and veins. Without vascular invasion, the five-year survival is 83%; it drops to 17% when vascular invasion is observed. Stage I ESS has the best prognosis, with five-year survival of 98% and ten-year survival of 89%. ESS makes up 0.2% of uterine cancers.|$|E
