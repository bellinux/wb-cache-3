5000|$|As {{with all}} waterfalls, hikers must {{exercise}} caution.

5|$|In every {{review and}} study {{conducted}} to date, the courage, valor, and {{discipline of the}} soldiers who fought at Wanat have been universally praised. These soldiers were well-trained, well-led, and fought bravely to defeat a determined and intense enemy action to overrun their base in Wanat.

After Amon's defeat, Valerian has turned the Terran Dominion into a government of peace and prosperity.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is likely}} that Native American tribes knew <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> for centuries. Captain William Clark <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lewis and Clark Expedition made a note in his journal about hearing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> but {{did not believe the}} story. The first European to see <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> was likely French fur trapper Baptise Ducharme who claimed to see <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> in 1824, 1826 and 1839. Jim Bridger and fellow {{explorer}} James Gremmell claimed they visited <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> in 1846. In 1851, Bridger provided missionary Father Pierre-Jean De Smet a map showing <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>falls.</b> <b>The</b> Cook-Folsom-Peterson Expedition, a private group of three explorers named <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> in 1869. [...] <b>The</b> earliest images <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> were drawn by Private Charles Moore, a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Army escort <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition which explored the Yellowstone River in August-September 1870. [...] During <b>the</b> Hayden Expedition <b>of</b> 1871, <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> were documented in photographs by William Henry Jackson and later in paintings by Thomas Moran. In January 1887, Frank Jay Haynes took the first winter photographs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>falls.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1860, Livingstone {{returned}} to the area and made a detailed study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> with John Kirk. Other early European visitors included Portuguese explorer Serpa Pinto, Czech explorer Emil Holub, who made the first detailed plan <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> and its surroundings in 1875 (published in 1880), and British artist Thomas Baines, who executed some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earliest paintings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>falls.</b> Until <b>the</b> area was opened up by <b>the</b> building <b>of</b> <b>the</b> railway in 1905, though, <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> were seldom visited by other Europeans. Some writers believe that the Portuguese priest Gon√ßalo da Silveira was the first European to catch sight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> back in <b>the</b> sixteenth century.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> {{is given}} as 200 ft (61 m) in Kevin Adams' book, North Carolina Waterfalls and 250 ft (77.1 m) by NCWaterfalls.com.

5|$|In the film, {{only five}} {{songs from the}} album are used in their entirety. Moreover, one song in the film, not {{included}} in the soundtrack, is the original version of Adho Andha Paravai Pola from the 1965 film Aayirathil Oruvan, which was bought from the original copyright holders of the song in December 2007. The film's picturisation of the three exploring the ruins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fallen</b> kingdom in the song, were praised.|$|E
5|$|National {{governmental}} {{bodies and}} charities were rapidly formed to produce memorials for these sites. The British government, for example, {{set up the}} Battle Exploits Committee in 1919 to create national battlefield memorials, alongside {{the work of the}} IWGC. Initially their intent was to celebrate the more heroic aspects of the fighting, and to avoid the flavour of memorials to the fallen that were being built elsewhere; by 1921, however, the committee had entered into a partnership with IWGC and adopted the same focus on the sacrifice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fallen</b> soldiers. The Canadian Battlefields Memorials Commission (CBMC) was similarly established in 1920 to produce war memorials for the major battlefields involving Canadian forces.|$|E
5|$|On April 27, nine <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fallen</b> militants {{were buried}} in Erec. Some 400 ethnic Albanians {{attended}} their funerals. The dead {{ranged in age from}} seventeen to forty-five years old. Villagers claimed that some of the dead had been arrested days before their deaths and thus could not have been ambushed, as the Yugoslav authorities claimed. Such claims could not be independently verified by Western reporters. In a 1998 report, Amnesty International affirmed that the 19 men had been killed in an ambush while trying to smuggle weapons into Kosovo.|$|E
50|$|At <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> {{is a set}} {{of small}} waterfalls {{dropping}} over about 8 metres. <b>The</b> final stage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> is over a 6-metre drop, raised to an effective 11m <b>fall</b> by <b>the</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water. <b>The</b> <b>falls</b> are a popular tourist attraction, being close to Taupo and readily accessible from State Highway One.|$|R
50|$|Various local tour {{companies}} offer trips to <b>the</b> Minyon <b>Falls,</b> including several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nimbin Tour buses; the day walks {{are available to}} <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> and night-time walks at <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>falls.</b>|$|R

5|$|Petry's wounds {{resulted}} {{in his right}} arm having to be amputated below the elbow. He was evacuated to an American hospital in Germany, where he spent several weeks in recovery before being transferred to Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center in Fort Hood, Texas. He now uses an advanced prosthetic in place of his right hand. On the prosthetic is a small plaque listing the names <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fallen</b> Rangers of his regiment.

5|$|The Przeworsk culture, {{named after}} a town in Lesser Poland, near which another burial ground was found, {{originated}} like the Oksywie culture around 250 BC, but lasted a long time. In its course it went through many changes, formed tribal and political structures, fought wars, also with the Romans, until in the 5th century AD its highly developed society of farmers, artisans, warriors and chiefs left for the temptations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fallen</b> empire lands (for many of them it happened possibly rather quickly, {{during the first half}} of that century).|$|E
5|$|The Town and County War Memorial {{does not}} contain a list of casualties. The local branch of the Royal British Legion {{launched}} a campaign for a memorial dedicated to the town and containing a list of names. A garden of remembrance was built in Abington Square, {{the location of the}} original temporary cenotaph, and unveiled by Major General Sir John Brown in 1937; the names <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fallen</b> were inscribed on the garden walls. The memorial to Edgar Mobbs‚Äîa professional rugby player from Northampton who was killed in the First World War in 1917‚Äîwas moved into the garden.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>falls</b> {{is named}} for the slick rocks {{at the top and}} bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>falls.</b> Before {{becoming}} a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pisgah National Forest, a cattle trail crossed Slick Rock Creek near <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>falls,</b> and occasionally, a stray animal would be carried over <b>the</b> <b>falls.</b>|$|R
50|$|Another major match {{going into}} the show is a No Disqualification match pitting Jimmy Jacobs against his former ally in <b>The</b> Age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fall,</b> Necro Butcher. <b>The</b> feud began when Jacobs abused his {{authority}} over Necro during his time with <b>The</b> Age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fall,</b> frustrating him {{to the point where}} he quit, to which Jacobs responded by having <b>The</b> Age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fall</b> violently attack him on several occasions.|$|R

5|$|The game {{received}} generally positive reviews, with {{praise for}} its visuals, traversal system, combat system, and humor. However, {{the game was}} criticized {{for the lack of}} a compelling story or innovative quest design. It received numerous nominations, including Best Xbox Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications. The game was supported with multiple downloadable content, including the story-based The Mystery of the Mooil Rig and Dawn of the Rise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fallen</b> Machine, after the game's release.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{point of}} the Dictum was the {{re-establishment}} of royal authority. The Provisions of Oxford, that had been forced on the king, were repudiated, and it was {{made clear that the}} appointment of ministers was entirely a royal prerogative. King Henry in turn reconfirmed Magna Carta and the Charter of the Forest. Measures were taken to renounce the increasing veneration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fallen</b> Simon de Montfort, whom some were already starting to consider a martyr and a possible saint.|$|E
5|$|The {{script was}} written by Ehren Kruger, who also collaborated on the {{narrative}} of Revenge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fallen.</b> Dark of the Moon employed both regular 35mm film cameras and specially-developed 3-D cameras, with filming locations in Chicago, Florida, Indiana, Milwaukee, Moscow, and Washington, D.C.. The film was rendered specifically for 3-D, and the visual effects involved more complex robots which took longer to render. In May 2011, {{it was announced that}} Paramount would move Dark of the Moon release date of July 1 to June 29, in order to monitor an early response to footage.|$|E
