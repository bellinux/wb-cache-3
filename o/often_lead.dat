5|$|A sungrazing comet is a comet {{that passes}} {{extremely}} {{close to the}} Sun at perihelion, generally within a few million kilometres. Although small sungrazers can be completely evaporated during such a close approach to the Sun, larger sungrazers can survive many perihelion passages. However, the strong tidal forces they experience <b>often</b> <b>lead</b> to their fragmentation.|$|E
5|$|Predators and prey {{interact}} and coevolve, the predator {{to catch the}} prey more effectively, the prey to escape. The coevolution of the two mutually imposes selective pressures. These <b>often</b> <b>lead</b> to an evolutionary arms race between prey and predator, resulting in antipredator adaptations.|$|E
5|$|Root {{extensions}} are additions {{of one or}} two sounds, often plosives, {{to the end of a}} root. These extensions do {{not seem}} to change the meaning of a root, and <b>often</b> <b>lead</b> to variant root forms across different descendants. The source and function of these extensions is not known.|$|E

5|$|Christopher Douglas {{argues that}} Jardine liked {{to make his}} runs when his side was in {{difficulty}} and enjoyed being tested; his approach would <b>often</b> <b>lead</b> his team to recovery from an unfavourable situation. Douglas comments that Jardine held {{his place in the}} England side despite strong competition from other batsmen. His defensive technique rescued England from weak positions in around a dozen innings and only played in two losses with England (which were his two least successful games with the bat). He also excelled in the main Gentlemen v Players fixture at Lord's, making a good score in each of his appearances in this match. Jack Hobbs classed him as a great batsman and believed that he was under-rated by his contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|Danny Baranowsky, the game's {{composer}} and who previously worked with McMillen on Super Meat Boy, was involved early {{on with the}} project shortly {{after the completion of}} the first prototype. McMillen and Baranowsky worked back and forth, with McMillen providing artwork from the game and allowing Baranowsky to develop the musical themes based on that; this would <b>often</b> <b>lead</b> to McMillen creating more art to support the music as it progressed. Baranowsky had been drawn to The Binding of Isaac as though the game puts forth a dark tone, he stated it had rather silly undertones underneath and such that one could not take it too seriously. Some of the songs were inspired by classical choral music but modified to fit the theme of the game. Other works were inspired by boss fight songs composed by Nobuo Uematsu for the Final Fantasy series. Baranowsky also had additional time after finishing the main songs for the game to craft short additional tracks that were used for special rooms like shops and secret areas.|$|E
