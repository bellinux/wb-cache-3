5|$|Chaplin {{then shot}} the {{sequence}} where the Little Tramp first meets the millionaire and prevents him from committing suicide. During filming, Henry Clive suddenly {{decided that he}} did not want to jump into the tank <b>of</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> in the scene, causing Chaplin to storm off the set and fire Clive. He was quickly replaced by Harry Myers, who Chaplin had known while under contract at Keystone Studios. Chaplin finished shooting the sequence on July 29, 1929 with exteriors at Pasadena Bridge. Chaplin then shot a sequence that was eventually cut from the film involving the Little Tramp attempting to retrieve a stick that was stuck in a wall. The scene included a young Charles Lederer; Chaplin later praised the scene, but insisted that it needed to be cut. He then continued filming the scenes with the millionaire until September 29, 1929.|$|E
5|$|Acid {{digestion}} is a two-stage process, {{involving the}} use of up to 93% sulfuric acid at 210–230°C. First, 60% sulfuric acid is added, thickening the reaction mixture as products are formed. Then, fuming sulfuric acid is added and the mixture is kept at the same temperature for another five hours to reduce the volume of solution remaining after dilution. The concentration of the sulfuric acid is selected based on reaction rate and viscosity, which both increase with concentration, albeit with viscosity retarding the reaction. Increasing the temperature also speeds up the reaction, but temperatures of 300°C and above must be avoided, because they cause insoluble thorium pyrophosphate to form. Since dissolution is very exothermic, the monazite sand cannot {{be added to the}} acid too quickly. Conversely, at temperatures below 200°C the reaction does not go fast enough for the process to be practical. To ensure that no precipitates form to block the reactive monazite surface, the mass of acid used must be twice that of the sand, instead of the 60% that would be expected from stoichiometry. The mixture is then cooled to 70°C and diluted with ten times its volume <b>of</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water,</b> so that any remaining monazite sinks to the bottom while the rare earths and thorium remain in solution. Thorium may then be separated by precipitating it as the phosphate at pH 1.3, since the rare earths do not precipitate until pH 2.|$|E

5|$|One day at Emain Macha, Cú Chulainn overhears Cathbad {{teaching}} his pupils. One {{asks him}} what that day is auspicious for, and Cathbad replies that any warrior who takes arms that day will have everlasting fame. Cú Chulainn, though only seven years old, goes to Conchobar {{and asks for}} arms. None of the weapons given to him withstand his strength, until Conchobar gives him his own weapons. But when Cathbad sees this he grieves, because he had not finished his prophecy—the warrior who took arms that day would be famous, but his life would be short. Soon afterwards, {{in response to a}} similar prophecy by Cathbad, Cú Chulainn demands a chariot from Conchobar, and only the king's own chariot withstands him. He sets off on a foray and kills the three sons of Nechtan Scéne, who had boasted they had killed more Ulstermen than there were Ulstermen still living. He returns to Emain Macha in his battle frenzy, and the Ulstermen are afraid he will slaughter them all. Conchobar's wife Mugain leads out the women of Emain, and they bare their breasts to him. He averts his eyes, and the Ulstermen wrestle him into a barrel <b>of</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water,</b> which explodes from the heat of his body. They put him in a second barrel, which boils, and a third, which warms to a pleasant temperature.|$|E

40|$|In early May of 1998 {{we saw the}} {{sea surface}} {{temperature}} signature {{of one of the}} strongest El Niños on record decay within a span of several weeks. At 125 W the SST dropped over 5 ºC in 17 days. What caused this abrupt end to the 1997 - 1998 El Niño? It is my goal to attempt to answer this question, at least in part, through the investigation of TAO mooring data including wind velocity, ocean SST, ocean currents, and sub-surface temperatures. There are number of mechanisms by which the SST of the eastern equatorial Pacific can be changed: 1. We know that upwelling <b>of</b> <b>colder</b> ocean <b>water</b> results from Ekman divergence at the Equator due to the persistent Easterlies. During El Niño, when these Easterlies are weakened and westerly wind bursts are present, this upwelling can be shut down. 2. Westward advection <b>of</b> <b>colder</b> <b>waters</b> by the North Equatorial Current may play a significant part in the SST variability. 3. The strength of the shear layer above the Equatorial Undercurrent {{may play a role in}} the entrainment <b>of</b> <b>colder</b> <b>water</b> into the mixed layer. The strength of this shear is dependent upon the zonal pressure gradient set up by the Easterlies. 4.

25|$|Two English {{works on}} the medical uses of water were {{published}} in the 18th century that inaugurated the new fashion for hydrotherapy. One of these was by Sir John Floyer, a physician of Lichfield, who, struck by the remedial use of certain springs by the neighbouring peasantry, investigated the history of cold bathing and published a book on the subject in 1702. The book ran through six editions within a few years and the translation of this book into German was largely drawn upon by Dr J. S. Hahn of Silesia as the basis for his book called On the Healing Virtues <b>of</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>Water,</b> Inwardly and Outwardly Applied, as Proved by Experience, published in 1738.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the unusual}} {{relationship}} between water's temperature and its density, lakes form layers called thermoclines, layers of drastically varying temperature relative to depth. Fresh water is most dense at about 4 degrees Celsius (39.2°F) at sea level. When {{the temperature of}} the water at the surface of a lake reaches the same temperature as deeper water, as it does during the cooler months in temperate climates, the water in the lake can mix, bringing oxygen-starved water up from the depths and bringing oxygen down to decomposing sediments. Deep temperate lakes can maintain a reservoir <b>of</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> year-round, which allows some cities to tap that reservoir for deep lake water cooling.|$|E
25|$|Primary erythromelalgia {{management}} is symptomatic, i.e. treating painful symptoms only. Specific management tactics include avoidance of attack triggers such as: heat, change in temperature, exercise or over exertion, alcohol and spicy foods.

Whilst a cool environment is helpful in keeping the symptoms in control, the use <b>of</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> baths is strongly discouraged.

40|$|Following {{the passage}} of {{hurricane}} Betsy (1965) through the Gulf of Mexico two flights were made five days apart aboard a research aircraft to collect sea-surface temperatures with an infrared radiometer. The purpose was to {{study the effects of}} a hurricane on the sea-surface temperatures field. Data from the first flight, which occurred one to two days after the hurricane passage, showed two cores <b>of</b> <b>colder</b> <b>water</b> {{to the right of the}} storm’s track and very little structure to the left. The flight made five days later still showed a core <b>of</b> <b>colder</b> <b>water</b> to the right, but by this time its shape had been badly distorted by the surface current system. These results are compared with the findings of other investigators, and the value of real-time synoptic coverage with the use of aircraft is pointed out. The plan for an experiment utilizing aircraft and airborne oceanographic techniques to provide a 3 -dimensional picture of the ocean temperature structure prior to and following a hurricane is also presented. 1...|$|R
5000|$|As hurricanes {{pass over}} warm {{areas of the}} Gulf of Mexico, they convert the ocean’s heat into storm energy. As this energy {{is removed from the}} seas, a wake <b>of</b> <b>colder</b> <b>water</b> can be {{detected}} along the hurricane’s path. This is because heat is withdrawn from the ocean mixed layer in a number of ways. For instance, sensible and latent heat are lost directly to the tropical cyclone across the air-sea interface. Also, the horizontal divergence of wind-driven mixed layer currents results in the upwelling <b>of</b> <b>colder</b> thermocline <b>water.</b> Finally, the turbulent entrainment <b>of</b> <b>colder</b> thermocline <b>waters</b> caused by wind stirring also results in the cooling of the surface waters. [...] These are the reasons that the depth of the ocean mixed layer is more important in hurricane deepening than sea surface temperature. A thin veneer of warm surface waters will be more susceptible to hurricane induced cooling than waters with a larger mixed layer and deeper thermocline. Furthermore, models suggest that cyclones are more likely to reach a larger fraction of their maximum potential intensity over warm oceanic features where the 26 °C isotherm extends beyond 100 meters.|$|R

25|$|A light batter is made <b>of</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> (sometimes {{sparkling}} {{water is}} used to keep the batter light) and soft wheat flour (cake, pastry or all-purpose flour). Eggs, baking soda or baking powder, starch, oil, and/or spices may also be added. Tempura batter is traditionally mixed in small batches using chopsticks {{for only a few}} seconds, leaving lumps in the mixture that, along with the cold batter temperature, result in the unique fluffy and crisp tempura structure when cooked. The batter is often kept cold by adding ice, or by placing the bowl inside a larger bowl with ice in it. Overmixing the batter will result in activation of wheat gluten, which causes the flour mixture to become soft and dough-like when fried.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the Normand gave a {{particularly}} large heating area (tube surface area) {{in relation to the}} grate area. The cost of this was a dense nest of tubes, where each of the numerous rows of tubes was bent into a different and complex shape. Tube ends entered the cylindrical drums perpendicularly, for good sealing. The space needed for all these tubes filled the entire lower half of the steam drum, requiring both a large drum and a separate steam dome from which to collect dry steam. The external boiler casing entered the flue uptake at one end, usually enclosing this dome. The ends of the drums extended outside the casing as hemispherical domes. Cold downcomers outside the casing linked these drums, providing a path for the return circulation <b>of</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
