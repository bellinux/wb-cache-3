5|$|The army group's {{previous}} commander, Georg von Küchler, had {{pleaded for}} permission to withdraw to the Panther Line in Estonia, which was still only half-completed at that stage. Model immediately cracked down on such talk, instituting a new policy he called Shield and Sword (Schild und Schwert). Under this doctrine, ground would only temporarily be ceded, to gather reserves for an immediate counter-attack that would drive the Red Army back and relieve pressure <b>on</b> <b>other</b> <b>areas</b> of the front. These statements of aggressive intent won over Hitler and OKH, who had no substantial reserves to send him, but were still unwilling to lose territory. Historians have since debated their significance, some claiming that Shield and Sword was Hitler's invention, while others say they were a calculated ploy by Model to disguise his true intent—to pull back to the Panther Line.|$|E

25|$|Logic and the {{philosophy}} of language are closely related. Philosophy of language {{has to do with}} the study of how our language engages and interacts with our thinking. Logic has an immediate impact <b>on</b> <b>other</b> <b>areas</b> of study. Studying logic and the relationship between logic and ordinary speech can help a person better structure his own arguments and critique the arguments of others. Many popular arguments are filled with errors because so many people are untrained in logic and unaware of how to formulate an argument correctly.|$|E

The ‘bronze halberd’ (not {{to be confused with the}} medieval halberd) was a weapon in use in Ireland from around 2400–2000 BC They are essentially broad blades that were mounted horizontally on a meter long handle, giving greater reach and impact than any known contemporary weapon (O’Flaherty 2007). They were subsequently widely adopted in other parts of Europe (Schuhmacher 2002), possibly showing a change in the technology of warfare.|$|E
500|$|The {{concerns}} were partially realized; the features, although not cut, were reduced, leaving Freelancer with a virtual world {{that did not}} live up to the industry's expectations. [...] It presented a static galaxy, where territories of various factions never change despite the groups' frequent raids and attacks on each other, and commodity prices remain fixed. [...] Nonetheless, reviewers from video game sites, such as Eurogamer and GameSpy, accepted the limitations and focused <b>on</b> <b>other</b> <b>areas</b> of the game. [...] They found the lack of variety a greater detraction from the game than the compromised dynamic world. [...] Excluding the single-player campaign, players never meet any memorable NPC because almost everyone sounds American. [...] According to Game Nation TV, after playing for a while, every character and place looked similar {{to the extent that the}} game makes [...] "Star Trek look like a xenomorphic zoo". [...] Furthermore, instead of serving as entertainment, the missions, which entail the pilot to fly to a particular location and destroy the enemies there, are so repetitive that they become chores to the reviewers instead.|$|E

Taking advantage of steady budgetary growth, from $116 million in 1975 to over $250 million by 1987, Boorstin actively participated in enhancing ties with scholars, authors, publishers, cultural leaders, and the business community.

2500|$|Chapter 8 sums up Keynes's {{relevance}} to the current age as of 2009. [...] The author suggests that Keynes would likely advise us to rethink macroeconomic policy, with {{a greater emphasis on}} balanced growth and with a somewhat large role for government in ensuring there is a smooth flow of investment to help protect the economy from unpredictable shocks. Macroeconomics should be reformed so that it again recognises the role of uncertainty and so it draws <b>on</b> <b>other</b> <b>areas</b> of knowledge such as history and International political economy, with a less central role for maths.
