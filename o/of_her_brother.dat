She was too overcome to speak and John Makini Kapena, one of her brother's minister, had to address the people on her behalf. After the visit, in the name <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>brother,</b> Liliʻuokalani made Father Damien a knight commander of the Royal Order of Kalākaua for his service to her subjects.

5|$|In 1336 John married Maud de Badlesmere, who was {{the second}} of the four daughters of Bartholomew de Badlesmere, 1st Baron Badlesmere, of Badlesmere in Kent and Margaret de Clare. Maud was a {{co-heiress}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>brother</b> Giles de Badlesmere, 2nd Baron Badlesmere. When Giles died in 1338, this brought {{a significant part of the}} Badlesmere inheritance into de Vere's hands. The marriage also forged a strong bond with William Bohun, Earl of Northampton, who had married Badlesmere's third daughter, Elizabeth de Badlesmere, and thus became Oxford's brother-in-law. The two campaigned together, sat on the same commissions and died the same year.|$|E
5|$|In October 1941, Reggie {{was offered}} a post as {{lecturer}} at Farouk University in Alexandria. The couple moved from Cairo to share a flat with fellow teacher Robert Liddell.

Almost immediately after her arrival in Alexandria came devastating news <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>brother</b> Oliver's death in a plane crash.

5|$|According {{to local}} newspapers, Barrett left {{approximately}} £1.7million to {{his two brothers}} and two sisters. This sum was apparently largely acquired from royalties from Pink Floyd compilations and live recordings featuring songs he had written while with the band. A tribute concert called Games for May {{was held at the}} Barbican Centre, London on 10 May 2007 with Robyn Hitchcock, Captain Sensible, Damon Albarn, Chrissie Hynde, Kevin Ayers and his Pink Floyd bandmates performing. A series of events called The City Wakes was held in Cambridge in October 2008 to celebrate Barrett's life, art and music. Barrett's sister, Rosemary Breen, supported this, the first-ever series of official events in memory <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>brother.</b> After the festival's success, arts charity Escape Artists announced plans to create a centre in Cambridge, using art to help people suffering from mental health problems. A memorial bench has been placed in the Botanic Gardens in Cambridge and a more prominent tribute is planned in the city.|$|E

5|$|Charles was {{the only}} son of Charles Martel, Prince of Salerno, and his wife, Clemence of Austria. He was born in 1288; the place of his birth is unknown. Charles Martel was the firstborn son of Charles II of Naples and Charles II's wife, Mary, who was a {{daughter}} of Stephen V of Hungary. After the death <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>brother,</b> Ladislaus IV of Hungary, in 1290, Queen Mary announced her claim to Hungary, stating that the House of Árpád (the royal family of Hungary) had become extinct with Ladislaus's death. However, her father's cousin, Andrew also laid claim to the throne, although his father, Stephen the Posthumous, had been regarded a bastard by all {{other members of the}} royal family. For all that, the Hungarian lords and prelates preferred Andrew against Mary and he was crowned king of Hungary on 23July 1290. She transferred her claim to Hungary to Charles Martel in January 1292. The Babonići, Frankopans, Šubići and other Croatian and Slavonian noble families seemingly acknowledged Charles Martel's claim, but in fact their loyalty vacillated between Charles Martel and AndrewIII.|$|E
5|$|In 1713 Cosimo III {{altered the}} Tuscan laws of {{succession}} {{to allow the}} accession of his daughter, and spent his final years canvassing the European powers to agree to recognise this statute. However, in 1735, {{as part of a}} territorial arrangement, the European powers appointed Francis Stephen of Lorraine as heir, and he duly ascended the Tuscan throne in her stead. After the death of Johann Wilhelm, Anna Maria Luisa returned to Florence, where she enjoyed the rank of first lady until the accession <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>brother</b> Gian Gastone, who banished her to the Villa La Quiete. When Gian Gastone died in 1737, Francis Stephen's envoy offered Anna Maria Luisa the position of nominal regent of Tuscany, but she declined. Her death, in 1743, brought the grand ducal House of Medici to an end. Her remains were interred in the Medicean necropolis, the Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence, which she helped complete.|$|E
5|$|Lady Jane Grey was the {{great-granddaughter}} of Henry VII {{through his}} youngest daughter Mary Tudor, and first cousin once removed to his grandson, King Edward VI. After Edward's death, a Protestant faction proclaimed her queen over Henry VIII's daughters, hoping {{to prevent the}} Catholic Mary Tudor from taking the throne. Two weeks after the death <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>brother,</b> Mary, {{with the support of}} the English people, claimed the throne, which Jane relinquished only nine days after being installed. She and her husband, Lord Guildford Dudley, were imprisoned in the Tower of London on charges of high treason. Jane's trial was conducted in November, but her sentence of death was suspended. In February 1554, Jane's father Henry, who had been pardoned, participated in Wyatt's rebellion. On 12 February, Mary had Jane, then aged 16, and her husband beheaded; Jane's father suffered the same fate two days later.|$|E
