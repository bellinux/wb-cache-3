5|$|Ghosh {{went against}} the {{expectations}} <b>of</b> <b>casting</b> a popular actor from Bollywood. He signed Bengali actor Abir Chatterjee to play Vidya's husband. According to Ghosh, popular Bollywood actors were not {{willing to work with}} him after his two previous flops. He also believed that audience might expect more screen-time from a better-known actor. Several other Bengali film and television actors, such as Indraneil Sengupta and Kharaj Mukherjee, were cast in supporting roles.|$|E
5|$|Multiple-tube {{seed drill}}: The wooden seed drill existed in China by the 3rd century BC, while the multiple-tube iron seed drill was first invented in China by the 2nd century BC, during the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD). The seed drill allowed for greater speed and {{regulation}} of distributing seeds in lined rows of crops instead <b>of</b> <b>casting</b> them {{out onto the}} farm field.|$|E

5|$|When {{platinum}} {{was declared}} a strategic government resource during World War II, many jewelry bands were {{made out of}} palladium. As recently as September 2001, palladium was more expensive than platinum and rarely used in jewelry because of the technical difficulty <b>of</b> <b>casting.</b> Currently, the casting problem has been resolved and use in jewelry has increased because platinum has increased in price while palladium decreased.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{supporting}} roles, {{one of the}} highest-profile pieces <b>of</b> <b>casting</b> was Malcolm McDowell as Soho porn baron Benny Barrett. Barrett appears in scenes across various episodes from 1966 through to 1979, but the production could only afford him for three weeks. This was because McDowell was then a resident in the United States. All of McDowell's scenes were therefore shot by Stuart Urban {{as part of the}} first block of filming, as opposed {{to the rest of the}} production which was filmed roughly chronologically. This was considered more than worthwhile, however, for the prestige of being able to use an actor such as McDowell, predominantly a film actor who rarely did television work.|$|E

5|$|Lead and tin: high density; {{extremely}} close dimensional accuracy; used for special forms of corrosion resistance. Such alloys {{are not used}} in foodservice applications for public health reasons. Type metal, an alloy of lead, tin and antimony (with sometimes traces of copper) is used for casting hand-set type in letterpress printing and hot foil blocking. Traditionally cast in hand jerk moulds now predominantly die cast after the industrialisation of the type foundries. Around 1900 the slug casting machines came onto the market and added further automation, with sometimes dozens <b>of</b> <b>casting</b> machines at one newspaper office.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{corrosion}} is the predominant mechanism for the deterioration <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> iron pipes, leading to the reduction of pipe capacity and ultimate collapse of the pipes. In order to assess the remaining service life <b>of</b> corroded <b>cast</b> iron pipes, it is imperative to understand the mechanisms of corrosion over a long term and to develop models for pipe deterioration. Although many studies have been carried out to determine the corrosion behavior <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> iron, little research has been undertaken to understand how cast iron pipes behave over a longer time scale than hours, days, or weeks. The present paper intends to fill the gap regarding the long-term corrosion behaviour <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> iron pipes in the absence of historical data. In this paper, a comprehensive experimental program is presented in which the corrosion behaviour of three exservice pipes was thoroughly examined in three simulated service environments. It has been found in the paper that localised corrosion is the primary form <b>of</b> corrosion <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> iron water pipes. It has also been found that the microstructure <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> irons is a key factor that affects the corrosion behaviour <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> iron pipes. The paper concludes that long-term tests on corrosion behaviour <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> iron pipes can help develop models for corrosion-induced deterioration of the pipes for use in predicting the remaining service life of the pipes...|$|R

5|$|Many of the film's {{actors were}} unknown {{at the time}} <b>of</b> <b>casting.</b> The film was the acting debut of four cast members; Ken Wahl, Tony Ganios, Erland van Lidth and Michael Wright. It was also the feature film debut of Toni Kalem, who had {{previously}} acted on television. Kaufman intentionally cast unknown actors; Wahl {{was on his way}} to a job in a pizza parlor when someone sent a photograph of him to Rudin, thinking he could play one of the smaller roles in the film. Kaufman felt Wahl was talented so he cast him in the lead role instead.|$|E

5|$|Scholars of {{religion}} Paul Ingram and Frederick Streng {{argued that the}} teachings of Buddhism challenge Augustine's view of good and evil, proposing a dualism in which good and evil have equal value instead <b>of</b> <b>casting</b> good over evil, as Augustine did. This {{is similar to the}} Manicheist account of good and evil– that the two are equal and in conflict– though Buddhism teaches that the two will come to a final conclusion and transcend the conflict. Ingram and Streng argued that the Augustinian theodicy fails to account for the existence of evil before Adam's sin, which Genesis presents {{in the form of the}} serpent's temptation.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{aim of the}} {{investigation}} was to verify if published data for calculation of the hardenability of steel {{can be used for}} calculation <b>of</b> hardenability <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> steel and the optimal selection of these data for obtaining the best agreement between calculated and experimental data. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis of the hardenability <b>of</b> low alloy <b>cast</b> steel was carried out using Jominy test and analytical Grossmann method. The optimal data for calculation of ideal critical diameter,Di and Jominy curve were selected. Findings: The hardenability curves <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> steel measured on different planes of Jominy test show scatter on the contrary to forged steelPractical implications: Results of investigations prove that data for calculation of hardenability parameters used for steel can be applied with sufficient accuracy for calculation the hardenability <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> steel.

5|$|The Han-era Chinese used {{bronze and}} iron {{to make a}} range of weapons, culinary tools, carpenters' tools and {{domestic}} wares. A significant product of these improved iron-smelting techniques was the manufacture of new agricultural tools. The three-legged iron seed drill, invented by the 2nd century BC, enabled farmers to carefully plant crops in rows instead <b>of</b> <b>casting</b> seeds out by hand. The heavy moldboard iron plow, also invented during the Han dynasty, required only one man to control it, two oxen to pull it. It had three plowshares, a seed box for the drills, a tool which turned down the soil and could sow roughly 45,730 m2 (11.3 acres) of land in a single day.|$|E

5|$|Culver first {{appeared}} as Casey Donovan in Boys in the Sand, directed by Wakefield Poole, in 1971. The film {{was an instant}} success and {{is considered one of}} the great classics of male erotic cinema. With the success and celebrity he garnered from the film, Donovan believed that he would be able to cross over into mainstream film. While there were meetings with directors like John Schlesinger and Raymond St. Jacques and talk <b>of</b> <b>casting</b> him in mainstream projects including adaptations of novels by Mary Renault and Patricia Nell Warren, the only film opportunities opened for him were as the star of more erotic films. These included the bisexual porn film Score, The Back Row with George Payne, L. A. Tool & Die with Bob Blount and Richard Locke, The Other Side of Aspen with Al Parker and Dick Fisk, Boys in the Sand II and Inevitable Love, with Jon King and Jamie Wingo. Shortly before his death he starred, heavily intoxicated, in the fisting movie Fucked Up, for Christopher Rage. He also appeared in a number of heterosexual porn films, most notably The Opening of Misty Beethoven where he had a scene with Constance Money.|$|E
5|$|Jordan Nagai as Russell. Throughout {{most of the}} film, {{he makes}} several {{comments}} to Carl that suggest that Russell's father and mother are no longer together. Russell's design was based on Pixar animator Peter Sohn. Docter auditioned 400 boys in a nationwide casting call for the part. Nagai, who is Japanese American, showed up to an audition with his brother, who was actually the one auditioning. Docter realized Nagai behaved and spoke non-stop like Russell and chose him for the part. Nagai {{was eight years old}} when cast. Docter encouraged Nagai to act physically as well as vocally when recording the role, lifting him upside down and tickling him for the scene where Russell encounters Kevin.
