50|$|Electronic {{multi-function}} fuzes {{started to}} appear around 1980. Using solid-state electronics they were relatively cheap and reliable, {{and became the}} standard fitted fuze in <b>operational</b> <b>ammunition</b> stocks in some western armies. The early versions were often limited to proximity airburst, albeit with height of burst options, and impact. Some offered a go/no-go functional test through the fuze setter.|$|E
40|$|Ammunition collectively termed {{practice}} ammunition {{is available in}} a multiplicity of designs suitable {{for use in a}} wide range of service ordnance. Ammunition used for practice contains live components and is designed to inflict minimum damage to or at the target. It is used primarily to reduce costs associated with using <b>operational</b> <b>ammunition</b> for maintaining those skills acquired during initial training programs. This report investigates the feasibility of producing locally a low cost purpose designed practice projectile to be used by the Medium Gun Regiment for training with 155 mm howitzers. The overall aim was to review the current processes for manufacturing high explosive filled projectiles and then to identify those processes which might not be necessary for the manufacture of practice projectiles, thereby reducing production costs. Two configurations, one utilizing production shell bodies filled with high explosive substitute and the second based on a hollow shell, ar...|$|E
40|$|There is no ‘quick-fix ’ {{solution}} to the problem of identifying a surplus of con-ventional ammunition. Surplus identification must differentiate functioning, <b>operational</b> <b>ammunition,</b> which is required for a nation’s armed services, from ammunition that either fails to meet or exceeds those requirements. The identification process requires making qualitative and quantitative assess-ments of ammunition and maintaining a precise ‘balance sheet ’ that can be used to calculate projected ammunition expenditure rates against the types, quantities, and condition of ammunition within national stockpiles. Surplus identification therefore depends on having a comprehensive monitoring and accounting system that covers the entire national stockpile. When these sys-tems are not in place, states have no means to determine whether their stock-piles meet or exceed requirements. Estimates and calculations It is important to make a distinction between a surplus estimate and the proc-ess of calculating a surplus. The first is a broad gauge of a given state’s propen...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedTomahawk cruise missiles (TCM) cost {{over one million}} dollars and are in short supply. U. S. Navy ships require TCM and other conventional ammunition be loaded in appropriate amounts prior to deploying to sea. A typical deployment lasts for six months and, when completed, any remaining ammunition must be unloaded and made ready for other deploying ships. For ships under Commander, Naval Surface Force U. S. Pacific Fleet (SURFPAC), about 3, 500 tons of ammunition must be loaded and unloaded annually; this currently costs 14 million dollars for just pilots, tugboats and fuel. This thesis formulates and solves an integer linear program, Surface Navy Scheduler (SNSKED), to prescribe an ammunition load and unload schedule for San Diego homeported ships. SNSKED seeks a schedule with minimized costs subject to constraints on ships availability, port capabilities and support assets. We test SNSKED on a realistic quarterly scenario consisting of 19 combatant ships, three weapons stations, two ammunition ships, five mission types, two ammunition types, and three ways of loading ammunition. SNSKED provides optimal schedules that reduce costs by over 16 percent. We also use SNSKED to evaluate different <b>operational</b> policies, <b>ammunition</b> port utilization, and ammunition loading times. Lieutenant Commander, United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|Ammunition {{accounting}} {{refers to}} information management {{systems and the}} associated operating procedures {{that are designed to}} record, numerically monitor, 1 verify, issue, and receive ammunition in stockpiles. Accurate accounting of stockpiles is an essential control measure in stock-pile management and security, one that can quickly identify stockpile losses or inaccuracies resulting from misplaced munitions, and wrongly issued or illicitly diverted stocks. Comprehensive accounting procedures are also a core component of effec-tive technical surveillance of ammunition. When used to record physical in-spection reports, they facilitate the management of unstable ammunition and thereby help to minimize the risks of explosion. Maintaining a comprehensive national stockpile inventory Stockpile safety and security apply to all state security force stocks of ammunition within a given country. These stocks, which encompass those of militaries, police forc-es, and other government agencies, can together be termed the ‘national stockpile’. 2 They comprise <b>operational</b> <b>ammunition</b> stocks (used to support routine oper-ations), war reserve ammunition, training ammunition, experimental ammuni-tion, ammunition at the point of manufacture, and ammunition awaiting disposal (Wilkinson, 2006, p. 232). Effective accounting procedures need to apply to all these categories of ammunition if states are to keep risks to safety and security within acceptable limits and maximize the efficient use of the national stockpile. 50 Conventional Ammunition in Surplus As Table 5. 1 illustrates, accounting is a core component of most stockpile management and security procedures. It can be roughly divided into two broad activities, contributing to the safety of stocks (i. e. minimizing the risk of explosion) and maintaining security (i. e. minimizing the risk of loss or diver-sion that could result in ammunition entering the illicit market). Accurate ac-counting of the national stockpile therefore necessitates the classification of ammunition for the purposes of monitoring: 1) the physical and chemical condition of stocks; and 2) the necessary measures required to secure particu-lar types of stocks from loss or theft...|$|E
40|$|Diversion is the {{unauthorized}} {{transfer of}} arms and ammunition from the stocks of legal users to the illicit market. Throughout the world, it sustains the activities of non-state armed groups, terrorist organizations, and armed crim-inality. It {{is one of the}} principal sources of illicit weaponry and represents a grave threat to the safety of civilian populations, {{as well as to the}} security of the state itself. Diversion takes many forms, ranging from large international transfers organized by corrupt military officials to low-level, localized theft and resale of munitions by military and police forces. Diversion affects all countries, and it occurs at all points in the national stockpile chain. This chapter systematizes types of diversion from national stockpiles. In each case, it highlights relevant stockpile management and physical se-curity measures that can be taken to curtail diversion. It concludes that di-version is largely a self-inflicted problem that stems from poor stockpile management by national authorities. However, many of the factors that fa-cilitate diversion can often be made less problematic by relatively simple, low-cost measures. Diversion in context Diversion poses a risk to any legally held quantity of arms and ammunition. It is a threat to <b>operational</b> <b>ammunition</b> stocks (used to support routine opera-tions), reserve ammunition, training ammunition, experimental ammuni-tion, 2 ammunition at the point of manufacture, and ammunition awaiting 146 Conventional Ammunition in Surplus disposal (Wilkinson, 2006, p. 232). Certain types of ammunition, however, pose a greater and more widespread risk than others. This is particularly so of small, portable munitions, such as small arms, light weapons, and their ammunition. These weapons are not only distributed throughout the na-tional stockpile, but are often deployed outside of secured facilities and un-der little centralized control. That said, it would be wrong to focus only on the smallest of conventional munitions. As the following sections outline, when conditions are permissive, almost any munitions can be (and are) sub-ject to diversion...|$|E
40|$|For a more {{in-depth}} {{understanding of the}} aging processes of munitions in expeditionary operations, research is performed {{with respect to the}} influence of transport, storage and use on the safety of ammunition. Within this programme the influences of parameters like temperature, humidity, vibrations, shock and combinations of these conditions which most likely affect the aging or stability of ammunition and pyrotechnic materials, are investigated experimentally. In addition, the experimental results will be used as input for simulations. The results of this programme will allow TNO Defence, Security and Safety to advise the Dutch Armed Forces on the technical issues related to the safe use of ammunition in expeditionary operations. With ongoing expeditionary operations and known extreme conditions, it is a worthwhile exercise to compare realistic loadings (either temperature, humidity, vibrations or shock) with the test conditions of the original Type Classification programmes, since it is very likely that the ammunition is subjected to conditions exceeding those for which the ammunition has originally been tested/classified. In {{the first phase of the}} programme, relevant health monitoring parameters have been identified, some of which are of essential importance for the health monitoring of ammunition during expeditionary operations. Models will be used or developed which describe the influence of these parameters on the aging of munition that is subjected to these extreme conditions. For collecting all relevant information regarding the <b>operational</b> stress on <b>ammunition,</b> a number of 40 sensors (temperature, humidity and vibration) have been placed on the different vehicles in Afghanistan. These sensors will give valuable information regarding the real stress during the Expeditionary Operations. The programme will result in architecture for a decision sheet for safe use of munition by the Dutch Armed Forces during expeditionary operations...|$|R
