5|$|Regeneration {{is useful}} in VFDs only where {{the value of the}} {{recovered}} energy is large compared to the extra cost of a regenerative system, and if the system requires frequent braking and starting. Regenerative VFDs are widely used where speed control of <b>overhauling</b> loads is required.|$|E

50|$|A top <b>overhaul</b> only {{covers the}} {{replacement}} of components inside the cylinder head without removing the engine from the vehicle, such as valve and rocker arm replacement. It {{may or may not}} include a valve job. A major <b>overhaul</b> however covers the whole engine assembly, which requires the engine to be removed from the vehicle and transferred to an engine stand. An <b>overhauled</b> engine refers to a major <b>overhaul.</b> By comparison, a major <b>overhaul</b> costs more than a top <b>overhaul.</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a repair shop with {{multiple}} parallel servers, which has to carry out planned <b>overhauls.</b> Each <b>overhaul</b> consists {{of a large number}} of maintenance jobs. The <b>overhaul</b> process is interrupted by randomly arriving emergency jobs. To control the delivery performance of the <b>overhauls,</b> knowledge about the <b>overhaul</b> makespan distribution should be available. Using a 2 -dimensional Markov model, we derive the first and second moment of the <b>overhaul</b> makespan analytically for the case that the repair times of all <b>overhaul</b> jobs are identically and exponentially distributed. For the case of nonidentical repair time distributions, an approximation is presented. Simulation shows that the makespan distribution fitted on these moments gives an excellent approximation...|$|R

He was selected as commandant by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, and later served in the administration of John F. Kennedy. He reformed the Corps, emphasizing combat readiness and fiscal efficiency, against what was perceived as politicking among its officers.|$|E

Instead, the funds were spent on <b>overhauling</b> the ship's powerplant. In August 1988, Iowa set sail on sea trials around the Chesapeake Bay area and then began refresher training in the waters around Florida and Puerto Rico in October.|$|E

5|$|On February 6, 1977, Amtrak {{announced}} plans to spend $24.4 million to overhaul all 61 cars {{as part of a}} larger fleet renewal program. In early 1977, some cars were repainted in Amtrak's Phase I paint scheme with red, white and blue ends and a small Amtrak logo. On September 28, the Amtrak board approved a more limited overhaul program of 16 Metroliners, as well as the purchase of the first 8 AEM-7 electric locomotives. On November 7, Amtrak released a specification for <b>overhauling</b> the 57 unmodified cars. It awarded a $20 million overhaul contract to GE that month.|$|E

40|$|A {{preventive}} maintenance policy with minimal repair at failure, periodic <b>overhaul</b> and replacement is considered. A model describing {{the effect of}} <b>overhaul</b> is proposed and the expected cost rate is obtained under negligible or non-negligible maintenance time. Based on this model, the optimal number of <b>overhauls</b> and optimal interval between <b>overhauls</b> for minimizing the expected cost rate over infinite time horizon are determined. Under some mild conditions, a unique optimal maintenance policy exists and a closed form expression for the optimal interval between <b>overhauls</b> is derived when the lifetime of the system follows Weibull distribution.

They won the 1961–62 Second Division title and were promoted to the First Division. Two seasons later, Liverpool won their first League title since 1946–47, thereby qualifying for Liverpool's first participation in UEFA competition. The following season, Liverpool won their first FA Cup. Further League titles followed in 1965–66 and 1972–73. 1973 brought their first European trophy, the 1972-73 UEFA Cup. The following season, Shankly's last, they won the FA Cup again.|$|E

In 1966 and again in 1968, activists within the ACLU encouraged the organization to adopt a policy <b>overhauling</b> the welfare system, and guaranteeing low-income families a baseline income; but the ACLU board did not approve the proposals. The ACLU {{played a key role}} in the 1968 King v. Smith decision, where the Supreme Court ruled that welfare benefits for children could not be denied by a state simply because the mother cohabited with a boyfriend.|$|E
5|$|The cruiser then {{returned}} to the Rufiji River so work could begin on <b>overhauling</b> her engines; the parts would need to be transported overland to the shipyard in Dar es Salaam where they could be rebuilt. While moored in the town of Salale, the ship was heavily camouflaged and defensive arrangements were erected. These included positioning soldiers and field guns to defend the approaches to the cruiser and establishing a network of coast watchers and telegraph lines to watch for hostile ships. An improvised minefield was also laid in the delta to keep the British ships from entering the river.|$|E

40|$|This article systematizes {{data on the}} {{new system}} for {{organizing}} and funding the <b>overhaul</b> of common property in an apartment building (AB), {{being one of the}} most important directions of communal services reform. The purpose of optimization of the <b>overhaul</b> system of apartment building common property is effective functioning of the AB common property <b>overhaul</b> system. The optimization shall be implemented by applying international practices, while considering the specifics of domestic procedures of apartment building <b>overhaul</b> system. A defining concept in this new <b>overhaul</b> system is the <b>overhaul</b> fund whose main source would be obligatory target payments made by owners of apartments in apartment buildings. The owners from each apartment building should select one of two possible ways to create such a fund (on a special account or on a regional operator’s account). The article deals with development of regulatory framework for <b>overhauls</b> of common property in apartment buildings, approval of the regional program, minimum rate of contribution for the <b>overhaul,</b> as well as creation and management of the regional operator’s activities. Considering a number of existing issues, this article lists basic ways how to optimize the <b>overhaul</b> system for apartment buildings.

5|$|The use of sleeve {{valves and}} oil baths to {{lubricate}} {{the moving parts}} of the engine units was inspired by contemporary internal combustion engine practice. This included oscillating gear that gave a 25-degree axial movement to the sleeves, allowing even lubrication of the moving parts. However, this resulted in an over-complicated mechanism that was difficult to maintain, perpetuating the seizures {{it was meant to}} eradicate. This feature was removed from both bogies of the prototype as the trials progressed. Another innovative feature of the steam bogie assembly was the ability to interchange them when faults occurred, an easy operation for maintenance staff when compared to the complexities of <b>overhauling</b> a regular steam locomotive's motion.|$|E
