25|$|In the Sulu Sea the {{presence}} of a dangerous reef and passing it at night was cause to turn back and steam slowly to pass the reef in daylight even though that increased contact with Japanese forces already in northeastern Borneo and Davao on Mindanao with still no confirmation of Japanese safe passage. The reef and string of islands marking the entrance to the Celebes Sea were passed safely in daylight of 3 January when the news of Manila's occupation by Japanese troops arrived along with the beginnings of a storm. The news caused considerable distress as the Filipino medical personnel and wounded aboard had left family there and the storm caused distress on <b>open</b> <b>decks,</b> soaking cots and sending some near the ship's rail. One man died in emergency amputation during the storm.|$|E
25|$|Although {{functioning}} as a hospital ship with Colonel Carroll and Lt. Fellmeth organizing the Filipino doctors and nurses into shifts the ship was not equipped as a hospital ship. Medical supplies had been hurriedly loaded. Patients were packed aboard with many on <b>open</b> <b>decks</b> {{and close to the}} ship's rails. The operating room was the ship's saloon. Of more concern, there was still, and never was, official Japanese government or military confirmation that the ship was recognized as a hospital ship and had been granted safe passage. Though final clearance had come from the International Red Cross in Geneva there was only official silence after the director of the Japanese Red Cross in Tokyo, Prince Shimadzu, had noted within Red Cross channels that the ship's status would be respected.|$|E

2500|$|MV Dartmouth Castle {{was built}} to a classic motor {{passenger}} vessel design, with <b>open</b> <b>decks</b> forward and aft of a lower deck saloon, and an open promenade deck above, with the wheelhouse at its forward end. [...] This wheelhouse was considerably older than the ship, having been originally fitted to the previous Dartmouth Castle - a 1907 vintage paddle steamer. [...] The promenade deck also featured {{a number of very}} tall ventilators, a canopy above, and a rather ugly landing deck - a raised deck allowing passengers to board from a high quayside at low tide.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1910 both ships, {{still missing}} their eight-inch guns, were {{commissioned}} into the Armed Reserve of the Baltic Fleet. The decision permitted the Navy {{to bring their}} crews to full strength. In the end of July Andrei Pervozvanny sailed to its sea trials with 583 men on board, Imperator Pavel I sailed to her trials in September–October with even fewer men. As predicted by theory, they turned out very [...] "wet" [...] ships even in calm seas. At [...] bow waves swept over all <b>open</b> <b>decks</b> and flooded the lookout cupolas and optical sights of main gun turrets, effectively prohibiting fire at high speed. Ivan Bubnov recommended fitting Andreis protruding bow ram with a scoop-shaped fairing, which would decrease bow wave height from [...] to [...] and eliminate flooding, but the NTC shelved the proposal.|$|E

2500|$|Once the Île de France was berthed at its New York pier, {{her career}} as a {{passenger}} ship was temporarily ended. Since the French were not anxious to return the ship to its homeland, it was towed to Staten Island by ten tugs and was laid up after special dredging that cost $30,000. Its crew of 800 persons was reduced to a security staff of 100 while it was inoperative for the next five months. Then during March 1940, commanded by the British Admiralty, to which it had been lent, the ship was loaded with 12,000 tons of war materials, submarine oil, tanks, shells, and several uncrated bombers that were stowed on the aft <b>open</b> <b>decks.</b> On 1 May 1940 she departed for Europe, veiled in gray and black. From there, it traveled to Singapore where, after the Fall of France, it was officially seized by the British. [...] In 1941 it returned to New York [...] and made several crossings from the northeast as a troop ship such as the one on February 14, 1944, sailing from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Greenock, Scotland, carrying among others the 814th Tank Destroyer Battalion.|$|E
