5|$|The {{cost of the}} Senedd {{increased}} from £12M in 1997 to £69.6M in 2006, an increase of 580%. In a report published in March 2008 by the Wales Audit Office, {{the reason for the}} difference between the two costs were that the <b>original</b> <b>estimate</b> of £12M was not based on any detailed design of the final requirements of the building. Extra costs of the building were due to unforeseen security measures after the 11 September attacks in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{construction}} costs meant the final total was £736,000, up from an <b>original</b> <b>estimate</b> of £235,000. The need for heating {{brought with it}} the requirement for boiler houses, plus additional foundations which were needed for the buildings {{to the north of}} the railway. Lieutenant J.G.N. Clifts of the Royal Engineers created the design for the site and buildings, and the contractor involved was a U.S. Army civil engineering company, appearing on records as American Construction Company. A temporary railway siding was created to aid in the delivery of building supplies. By 13 December 1918, several sheds had been completed, as were the Officers' Mess, sleeping quarters and the Navy and Army Canteen Board.|$|E

5|$|Calthrop {{constructed}} {{the line for}} £35,944, £11,000 less than the <b>original</b> <b>estimate.</b> He had Kitson & Co construct two 2-6-4T locomotives, similar in outline but smaller than the Barsi Light Railway locomotives. Goods rolling stock included four coaches, two bogie open wagons and one bogie van, once again similar to Barsi stock. He also introduced four transporter wagons, designed to transport standard-gauge wagons. Each station on route had a short section of standard-gauge track where the wagons could be placed. The use of transporter wagons eliminated transshipment, and removed the need for large numbers of goods wagons.|$|E

5|$|Subsequent {{analyses}} {{called the}} original landing zone estimate into question: Scott, who was flying the aircraft manually because of Cooper's speed and altitude demands, later determined that his flight path was significantly farther east than initially assumed. Additional {{data from a}} variety of sources—in particular Continental Airlines pilot Tom Bohan, who was flying four minutes behind Flight 305—indicated that the wind direction factored into drop zone calculations had been wrong, possibly by as much as 80 degrees. This and other supplemental data suggested that the actual drop zone was probably south-southeast of the <b>original</b> <b>estimate,</b> in the drainage area of the Washougal River.|$|E
5|$|The Senedd was {{constructed}} in two phases, the first in 2001 and the second from August 2003 until it was {{handed over to the}} National Assembly in February 2006. Between phases, the National Assembly changed contractors and the project's management structure, but retained Rogers as the scheme architect. The building was nearly six times over budget and four years and 10 months late, compared to the original estimates of the project in 1997. Total costs rose due to unforeseen security measures after the 11 September attacks, and because the National Assembly did not have an independent cost appraisal of the project until December 2000, three years after the <b>original</b> <b>estimate.</b> Phase 2 costs rose by less than 6% over budget, and that phase was six months late.|$|E
5|$|The {{distance}} to Vega {{can be determined}} by measuring its parallax shift against the background stars as the Earth orbits the Sun. The first person to publish a star's parallax was Friedrich G. W. von Struve, when he announced a value of 0.125arcseconds (0.125″) for Vega. Friedrich Bessel was skeptical about Struve's data, and, when Bessel published a parallax of 0.314″ for the star system 61 Cygni, Struve revised his value for Vega's parallax to nearly double the <b>original</b> <b>estimate.</b> This change cast further doubt on Struve's data. Thus most astronomers at the time, including Struve, credited Bessel with the first published parallax result. However, Struve's initial result was actually close to the currently accepted value of 0.129″, {{as determined by the}} Hipparcos astrometry satellite.|$|E

5|$|The {{failure to}} {{identify}} the reorganization of the defenses was a rare intelligence breakdown for the Allies. Post-action reports still documented the <b>original</b> <b>estimate</b> and assumed that the 352nd had been deployed to the coastal defenses by chance, a few days previously, {{as part of an}} anti-invasion exercise. The source of this inaccurate information came from German prisoners of war from the 352nd Infantry Division captured on D-Day as reported by the 16th Infantry S-3 D-Day Action Report. In fact, Allied intelligence had already become aware of the relocation of the 352nd Infantry Division on June 4. This information was passed on to V Infantry Corps and 1st Infantry Division HQ through 1st Army, but at that late stage in the operations, no plans were changed.|$|E
5|$|Widely {{divergent}} {{costs for}} the project were discussed. The <b>original</b> <b>estimate</b> was £140,000 if the railway was built, and £200,000 if the tunnel was built. Opponents suggested the cost would be nearer £700,000, and John Rennie estimated the tunnel line would cost £440,790 in 1809. Opponents argued that the real intent was to improve the water supply for the Basingstoke Canal or to line the pockets of George Hollis, {{the owner of the}} Itchen Navigation. There was considerable interest in the scheme, as 1,244 shares of £100 had been subscribed by early 1809, but with opposition from land and mill owners, and Rennie's report indicating much higher costs, the project was dropped.|$|E
5|$|De Gomme {{prepared}} several {{plans for}} the King in 1665; a further iteration of the designs was submitted in 1670 and given royal approval. Work began the same year but it took until 1685 to complete the project. The work {{was carried out by}} skilled contractors, who were supplemented by large teams of pressed men brought in from across the region; during 1671, up to 256 workers were employed on the site. Around 3,000 timber piles had to be brought from Norway for the project in 1671 to support the foundations in the marshy ground. The resources needed for the King's multiple defence projects became stretched, and one of the planned bastions at Tilbury, originally planned to face the river, was cancelled in 1681, in part to save money.

5|$|Mr Knight of Cannington {{alerted the}} nuns {{to the sale}} of Taunton Lodge, and they raised the £3,150 {{required}} to purchase it. They completed the purchase in early May 1807, after some minor quibbles with the Coles family. When the abbess visited the Lodge prior to the purchase, she had identified that it would require £1,000 worth of improvements {{in addition to the}} money already spent on its acquisition. The plans included extending the existing building to gain a staircase and some dormitories for the school girls, and the addition of a new wing that would include a chapel, infirmary, four cells, and rooms for the male chaplain and servants. The new building was begun in March 1808, and by June of that year, the entire community had moved from Winchester, despite the work being ongoing. The shell of the new body was completed by the autumn of 1808, but the work was delayed {{due to a lack of}} finances as £1,908 had already been spent on altering the old building. This cost did not include the erection of the new wing, thus the constructions costs were already far surpassing the <b>original</b> <b>estimate.</b>|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{significant}} debate {{as to the}} star's actual distance from Earth. The debate revolves around the different methodologies to measure distanceparallax being the most central, but photometric and spectroscopic observations yielding valuable insights as well. Before the Hipparcos mission, the estimated distance for the Pleiades star cluster was around 135 parsecs or 440 light years. However, when the Hipparcos Catalogue was published in 1997, the new parallax measurement indicated a much closer distance of about 119 ± 1.0 pc (388 ± 3.2 ly), triggering substantial controversy among astronomers. If the Hipparcos estimate were accurate, some astronomers contend, then stars in the cluster {{would have to be}} fainter than Sun-like starsa notion that would challenge some of the fundamental precepts of stellar structure. Interferometric measurements taken in 2004 by the Hubble Telescope's Fine Guidance Sensors and corroborated by studies from Caltech and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory showed the <b>original</b> <b>estimate</b> of 135 pc or 440 ly to be the correct figure. However a recent study published in 2009 has argued otherwise, publishing a new parallax measurement of 8.32 mas with a very tight error factor of 0.13 mas yielding a distance of 120.2 ± 1.9 pc or 392.0 ± 6.0 ly. Which distance estimate future astrometric calculations will corroborate remains to be seen, although the upcoming Gaia mission with its expected launch in late 2012 could well prove to be the ultimate arbiter in this debate.|$|E
