5|$|The Sainte-Laguë {{method is}} used for allocating {{parliamentary}} seats to parties. As a result, the percentage of representatives is roughly equal to the nationwide percentage <b>of</b> <b>votes.</b> Still, a party with a high number <b>of</b> <b>votes</b> in only one constituency can win a seat there even if the nationwide percentage is low. This has happened several times in Norwegian history. Conversely, if a party's initial representation in Parliament is proportionally less than its share <b>of</b> <b>votes,</b> the party may seat more representatives through leveling seats, provided that the nationwide percentage is above the election threshold, at 4 percent. In 2005, nineteen seats were allocated via the leveling system.|$|E
