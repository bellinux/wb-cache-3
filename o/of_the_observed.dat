5|$|If {{the mass}} of a main-sequence star is lower than {{approximately}} half a solar mass, it will never become hot enough to fuse helium in its core. It is thought that, over a lifespan that considerably exceeds {{the age of the}} Universe (c. 13.8 billion years), such a star will eventually burn all its hydrogen and end its evolution as a helium white dwarf composed chiefly of helium-4 nuclei. Due to the very long time this process takes, it is not thought to be the origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>observed</b> helium white dwarfs. Rather, they are thought to be the product of mass loss in binary systems or mass loss due to a large planetary companion.|$|E
5|$|No {{subspecies}} are recognised, and {{the degree}} of geographic variation is unclear. Adult male birds which breed on the mainland have been reported as having lighter upperparts and underparts than their Tasmanian relatives, and females are said to be browner, but these differences may also result from worn plumage. Furthermore, migration across the Bass Strait by some birds obfuscates the issue. Mainland and Tasmanian birds are the same size. Ornithologists Richard Schodde and Ian Mason argued that the poor quality of museum collections and partially migratory habits meant that discrete subspecies could not be distinguished on the basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>observed</b> variation within the species.|$|E

The fluctuations did not occur simultaneously along all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>observed</b> wavelengths, which Jeremy Goodman of Princeton University explained as being the result of the radio waves being bent by interstellar plasma in the Milky Way. Such radio scintillations (rapid variations in the radio luminosity of an object) occur only when the source has an apparent diameter of less than 3microarcseconds.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} theorise {{that the}} galactic tide {{may have contributed}} to the formation of the Oort cloud by increasing the perihelia (smallest distances to the Sun) of planetesimals with large aphelia (largest distances to the Sun). The effects of the galactic tide are quite complex, and depend heavily on the behaviour of individual objects within a planetary system. Cumulatively, however, the effect can be quite significant: up to 90% of all comets originating from the Oort cloud may be the result of the galactic tide. Statistical models <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>observed</b> orbits of long-period comets argue that the galactic tide is the principal means by which their orbits are perturbed toward the inner Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Their {{experiment}} {{showed a}} statistically significant difference in the thickness of the stomach mucosa. The mucosa of rats fed raw or cooked potato modified with the GNA gene was thicker than that of rats fed the unmodified potato. The crypt length in the jejunum was greater on rats fed the raw modified potato, although there was no statistical difference observed in the rats fed the cooked potato. As these effects were not observed in rats fed the control potatoes spiked with GNA, Pusztai concluded that the differences were a result of the transformation procedure, rather than the presence of GNA. Pusztai's collaborator Stanley Ewen said that the cauliflower mosaic virus used as a promoter could likely be the cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>observed</b> changes.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, Weksler {{and colleagues}} {{followed}} the 2001 definition by Sánchez {{and others for}} the restricted genus Oryzomys, but added O.antillarum from Jamaica as a species. Carleton and Joaquin Arroyo-Cabrales reviewed Oryzomys from western Mexico in 2009 and in this context provided an extended diagnosis of Oryzomys. They recognized eight species: the six previously mentioned plus O.albiventer and O.peninsulae. Also in 2009, Robert Voss and Weksler identified the subfossil Oryzomys curasoae from Curaçao as an island population of O.gorgasi. The next year, Delton Hanson and colleagues published a study using DNA sequence data from the cytochrome b, interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein, and alcohol dehydrogenase 1 genes to assess relationships within Oryzomys.

50|$|The preparative state, with {{unspecified}} phase, leaves {{room for}} <b>the</b> several members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ensemble to interact in respectively several various ways with other systems. An example is {{when an individual}} system is passed to an observing device so as to interact with it. Individual systems with various phases are scattered in various respective directions in <b>the</b> analyzing part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>observing</b> device, in a probabilistic way. In each such direction, a detector is placed, in order to complete the observation. When the system hits <b>the</b> analyzing part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>observing</b> device, that scatters it, it ceases to be adequately described by its own wave function in isolation. Instead it interacts with <b>the</b> <b>observing</b> device in ways partly determined by <b>the</b> properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>observing</b> device. In particular, there is in general no phase coherence between system and observing device. This lack of coherence introduces an element of probabilistic randomness to the system-device interaction. It is this randomness that is described by the probability calculated by the Born rule. There are two independent originative random processes, one that <b>of</b> preparative phase, <b>the</b> other that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>observing</b> device. <b>The</b> random process that is actually observed, however, is neither of those originative ones. It is the phase difference between them, a single derived random process.|$|R
