40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} directed cographs, which {{are defined by}} Bechet et al. by the disjoint union, series, and order composition, from <b>an</b> algorithmic point <b>of</b> view. Using their recursive structure we give dynamic programming algorithms to show that for every directed cograph the size <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>largest</b> edgeless subdigraph, the size <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>largest</b> subdigraph which is a tournament, the size <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>largest</b> semicomplete subdigraph, and the size <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>largest</b> complete subdigraph can be computed in linear time. Our main {{results show that the}} hamiltonian path, hamiltonian cycle, regular subdigraph, and directed cut problem are polynomial on directed cographs. </p...|$|R

5|$|Divers are aquatic birds {{the size}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> duck, {{to which they}} are unrelated. They swim well and fly {{adequately}} but, because their legs are placed towards the rear of the body, are clumsy on land. They feed on fish and other aquatic animals.|$|E
5|$|Glimmer and Taxable {{were very}} similar operations. They were {{executed}} {{in the early hours}} of 6 June 1944 whilst the invasion fleet was approaching Normandy. Taxable simulated an invasion force approaching Cap d'Antifer and Glimmer threatened Pas-de-Calais. By dropping chaff in progressive patterns, Royal Air Force (RAF) bombers were able to create the illusion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> fleet on coastal radar screens. Beneath the chaff, small boats towed radar reflector balloons and simulated the radio traffic expected <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> fleet. Once German forces were drawn to the coast, it was planned that the RAF would attempt to contain them in this region, and away from Normandy, by bombing bridges and roads.|$|E
