We developed Virtual <b>Office</b> <b>Environment</b> <b>System</b> (VOES), and avatar is used to navigate and to interact with other participants. For easy and intuitive control of avatar motion in the system, we use continuous hand gesture recognition system. State automata are proposed in hand gesture recognition to segment continuous hand gesture and to remove meaningless motion. Using avatar and gesture interface, this system provides natural navigation and interaction in virtual <b>environment</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{acceptance}} of novel office automation devices and systems depends primarily on {{their potential for}} increasing productivity and their ease of use. This paper discusses the tech-nology and ergonomics of several new office automation devices. Four major office inter-actions are noted: transacting, documenting, telephoning, and meeting. For each, human factors characteristics are examined to provide an understanding of which systems can most easily be incorporated into existing <b>office</b> <b>environments.</b> <b>Systems</b> design methodolo-gies, originally developed for military use, will find increasing utility for solving complex civilian problems. There is now a need to apply this methodology {{to the design of}} equipment, tasks, and systems. More research is needed to increase our understanding of office auto-mation and how it may be implemented. Particularly important are comparative field studies of office tasks and office automation devices and systems...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} enable the {{widespread}} use of robots in home and <b>office</b> <b>environments,</b> <b>systems</b> with natural interaction capabilities have to be developed. A prerequisite for natural interaction is the robot's ability to automatically recognize when and how long a person's attention is directed towards it for communication. As in open environments several persons can be present simultaneously, the detection of the communication partner is of particular importance. In this paper we present an attention system for a mobile robot which enables the robot to shift its attention to the person of interest and to maintain attention during interaction. Our approach is based on a method for multi-modal person tracking which uses a pan-tilt camera for face recognition, two microphones for sound source localization, and a laser range finder for leg detection. Shifting of attention is realized by turning the camera into the direction of the person which is currently speaking. From the orientation of the head it is decided whether the speaker addresses the robot. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated with an evaluation. In addition, qualitative results from the performance of the robot at the exhibition part of the ICVS' 03 are provided...|$|R
40|$|Background: Concentration of {{knowledge}} work in cities generates innovations entailing economic development. This paper addresses {{the challenge of}} turning around the present trend of urban sprawl toward the concentrated knowledge work in cities. The assumption is that dislocation of office and residential housing entailing longer commuting mileage is {{the main cause of}} urban sprawl. Methods: The life cycle costs method is used for comparison of <b>office</b> <b>systems.</b> The present <b>offices</b> <b>system</b> is compared to the concentrated mega <b>offices</b> <b>system</b> outside cities, as well as the local and home offices within cities. The life cycle costs are assessed with statistical data on space, materials and energy, and information services. These are the main resources of the <b>offices</b> <b>systems</b> given labor and capital. Results: Commuting costs about 22 % of the annual average wage and causes congestion, fragmentation of districts, health risks and pollution. These high costs can be reduced by changes in the <b>office</b> <b>systems.</b> The present <b>office</b> <b>system</b> with commuting adds 40 % to the average labor costs. The innovative <b>office</b> <b>systems</b> reduce these costs by 15 to 28 % of the present offices. Sensitivity analyses underpin the findings for nearly all urban conditions. The local <b>office</b> <b>systems</b> are particularly cost-effective. The local <b>office</b> <b>system</b> can also save nearly 78 % energy and reduce 74 % CO 2 emission of the present offices along with less space use. Congestion, as well as fragmentation of communities and nature caused by commuting can be avoided. Conclusions: Some project developers invest in the distributed offices. Policies encourage such investments if they reallocate funds from infrastructure into refurbishing of the available housing and internalize the external effects of land use in the costs of real estate development. These policies increase smartness of cities, reduce energy use, and improve living qualities in cities...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{technological}} advances have {{made possible the}} automation of traditional office functions such as document preparation, storage, retrieval, inter-personal communication, etc. With the increased pervasiveness of <b>office</b> <b>systems</b> technology, selection of the appropriate technology components can be a complex and difficult task.

In this paper, we propose to structure the selection problem in a hierarchical fashion, with the top level representing the single overall objective, the intermediate level(s) representing the users' needs, and the lowest level representing the viable candidate set of alternative <b>office</b> <b>systems</b> to be evaluated. A recently developed technique termed analytical hierarchies is employed, and a case study is presented to illustrate how the technique can be used in the selection of <b>office</b> <b>systems</b> components. ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{test the}} impact of {{physician}} education and facilitator assisted <b>office</b> <b>system</b> interventions on cancer early detection and preventive services. DESIGN [...] A randomised trial of two interventions alone and in combination. SETTING AND SUBJECTS [...] Physicians in 98 ambulatory care practices in the United States. INTERVENTIONS [...] The education intervention consisted of a day long physician meeting directed at improving knowledge, attitudes, and skills relevant to cancer prevention and early detection. The <b>office</b> <b>system</b> intervention consisted of assistance from a project facilitator in establishing routines for providing needed services. These routines included division of responsibilities for providing services among physicians and their staff {{and the use of}} medical record flow sheets. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] The proportions of patients provided the cancer prevention and early detection services indicated annually according to the US National Cancer Institute. RESULTS [...] Based on cross sectional patient surveys, the <b>office</b> <b>system</b> intervention was associated with an increase in mammography, the recommendation to do breast self examination, clinical breast examination, faecal occult blood testing, advice to quit smoking, and the recommendation to decrease dietary fat. Education was associated only with an increase in mammography. Record review for a patient cohort confirmed cross sectional survey findings regarding the <b>office</b> <b>system</b> for mammography and faecal occult blood testing. CONCLUSION [...] Community practices assisted by a facilitator in {{the development and implementation of}} an <b>office</b> <b>system</b> can substantially improve provision of cancer early detection and preventive services...|$|R
