5|$|Aside from humans, {{octopuses}} may be preyed on by fishes, seabirds, sea otters, pinnipeds, cetaceans, {{and other}} cephalopods. Octopuses typically hide or disguise themselves by camouflage and mimicry; some have conspicuous warning coloration (aposematism) or deimatic behavior. An octopus may spend 40% {{of its time}} hidden away in its den. When the octopus is approached, it may extend an arm to investigate. 66% of Enteroctopus dolfleini in one study had scars, with 50% having amputated arms. The blue rings of the highly venomous blue-ringed octopus are hidden in muscular skin folds which contract when the animal is threatened, exposing the iridescent warning. The Atlantic white-spotted octopus (Callistoctopus macropus) turns bright brownish red with oval white spots all <b>over</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> high contrast display. Displays are often reinforced by stretching out the animal's arms, fins or web {{to make it look}} as big and threatening as possible.|$|E
5|$|For example, in {{the common}} {{cuttlefish}} the display consists of flattening the body, making the skin pale, showing a pair of eyespots on the mantle, dark eye rings, and a dark line on the fins, and dilating the pupils of the eyes. The common octopus similarly displays pale skin and dark eye rings with dilated pupils, but also curls its arms and stretches out the web between the arms as far as possible, and squirts out jets of water. Other octopuses such as Atlantic white-spotted octopus turn bright brownish red with oval white spots all <b>over</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> high contrast display. The paper nautilus can rapidly change its appearance: it suddenly withdraws the shining iridescent web formed by its first pair of arms from its shell.|$|E

5|$|In Robson's {{first home}} match in charge, bottom-placed Newcastle faced second bottom Sheffield Wednesday, {{thrashing}} them 8–0. In {{his first season}} in charge, 1999–2000, Robson led the club to an 11th-place finish, with 14 wins from his 32 matches in charge. In late 2000, following the resignation of ex-Magpies boss Kevin Keegan as England manager, the FA asked Newcastle club chairman Freddy Shepherd to permit Robson to take <b>over</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> part-time caretaker capacity, but the request was refused. Robson guided Newcastle from bottom of the Premier League to a fourth-place finish in the 2001–02 season. The following season, Newcastle finished third, ensuring qualification for the UEFA Champions League {{for the second consecutive}} year.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} of Sam and Max {{were created in}} Purcell's youth; Purcell's younger brother Dave originally came up with several comics around {{the idea of a}} dog and rabbit detective duo. Dave would often leave unfinished comics around the house. Deliberately making the characters mix up each other's names, shoot at each other and mock {{the way in which they}} had been drawn, Steve, in a case of sibling rivalry, would sometimes finish the stories in parodies of their original form. This developed from Steve mocking his brother's to the creation of his own stories with the characters. In the late 1970s, Dave Purcell gave Steve the rights to the characters; he signed them <b>over</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> contract on Steve's birthday and allowed him to develop the characters in his own way. Purcell believes that his younger brother has recovered and forgiven him from their earlier years. Having kept one as a pet in his youth, Purcell has an interest in rats, which are commonly featured in his artistic work.|$|E
5|$|Toothache {{may occur}} at any age, in any gender {{and in any}} {{geographic}} region. Diagnosing and relieving toothache {{is considered one of}} the main responsibilities of dentists. Irreversible pulpitis is thought to be the most common reason that people seek emergency dental treatment. Since dental caries associated with pulpitis is the most common cause, toothache is more common in populations that are at higher risk of dental caries. The prevalence of caries in a population is dependent upon factors such as diet (refined sugars), socioeconomic status, and exposure to fluoride (such as areas without water fluoridation). In the United States, an estimated 12% of the general population reported that they suffered from toothache at some point in the six months before questioning. Individuals aged 18–34 reported much higher experience of toothache than those aged 75 or <b>over.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> survey of Australian schoolchildren, 12% had experienced toothache before the age of five, and 32% by the age of 12. Dental trauma is extremely common and tends to occur more often in children than adults.|$|E

25|$|Andrews was {{selected}} for Australia's team for the inaugural Women's World Twenty20 held in England in 2009. The Australians hosted New Zealand for <b>a</b> three-match series <b>in</b> tropical Darwin {{at the beginning of}} June before the World Cup, and Andrews showed good form taking five wickets at 11.40 at an economy rate of only 5.70, with a best of 3/13 from three <b>overs</b> <b>in</b> the final match, helping Australia seal the series 2–1. However, she could not maintain the form. She took 0/31 from three <b>overs</b> <b>in</b> the team's only warm-up on English soil, against the hosts, and was retained for all the matches, despite taking only two wickets at 43.50 and taking an economy rate of 7.56. Andrews took 0/25 from three <b>overs</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> nine-wicket loss to New Zealand, but was retained for the match against the Wester Indies, taking 2/19 from four <b>overs</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> eight-wicket win. She was again attacked in the group match against South Africa, taking 0/19 from two <b>overs</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 24-run win that qualified Australia for the semi-finals. Andrews was retained and was again ineffective, taking 0/24 from 2.3 overs as the hosts won by eight wickets to reach the final, which they won.

25|$|Urinals in {{high-capacity}} washrooms {{are usually}} arranged {{in one or}} more rows directly opposite the door, so that users have their backs to people entering or standing outside. Urinals in the street may be arranged in a circle, with all users facing the center, with partitions high enough that they cannot wet each other, and usually high enough that they cannot see <b>over.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> street urinal with an outside screen or wall, the users may stand back to back.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability of}} a fishery to recover from {{overfishing}} depends on whether the ecosystem's conditions are suitable for the recovery. Dramatic changes in species composition can result in an ecosystem shift, where other equilibrium energy flows involve species compositions different from those that had been present before the depletion of the original fish stock. For example, once trout have been overfished, carp might take <b>over</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> way that {{makes it impossible for}} the trout to re-establish a breeding population.|$|E
25|$|The artwork on {{the walls}} was a {{particular}} feature of the school in its early years.
