5|$|Because {{high levels}} of jitter have been {{detected}} in the spectrum of HAT-P-33, the ability to collect the most sensitive radial velocity measurements possible has been dulled. The loss <b>of</b> <b>accuracy</b> has prevented astronomers from disregarding the possibility that HAT-P-33 is actually a binary star, where the secondary, dimmer companion is visually indistinguishable from the brighter primary companion. If this is the case, then the dimmer star in the HAT-P-33 system {{would have to have}} a mass that is less than 0.55 times that of the Sun. A search for a binary companion star using adaptive optics at the MMT Observatory was negative.|$|E

5|$|The {{observation}} {{of a total}} solar eclipse of May 29, 1919, helped to confirm Einstein's theory of general relativity. By comparing the apparent distance between stars in the constellation Taurus, with and without the Sun between them, Arthur Eddington stated that the theoretical predictions about gravitational lenses were confirmed. The observation with the Sun between the stars was only possible during totality since the stars are then visible. Though Eddington's observations were near the experimental limits <b>of</b> <b>accuracy</b> at the time, work in the later half of the 20th century confirmed his results.|$|E

5|$|A {{criticism}} {{of this method}} {{is that it can}} be statistically weak. Schaefer in particular has questioned how robust the claimed alignments in the Caracol are. Because of the wide variety of evidence, which can include artefacts as well as sites, there is no one way to practice archaeoastronomy. Despite this it is accepted that archaeoastronomy is not a discipline that sits in isolation. Because archaeoastronomy is an interdisciplinary field, whatever is being investigated should make sense both archaeologically and astronomically. Studies {{are more likely to be}} considered sound if they use theoretical tools found in archaeology like analogy and homology and if they can demonstrate an understanding <b>of</b> <b>accuracy</b> and precision found in astronomy. Both quantitative analyses and interpretations based on ethnographic analogies and other contextual evidence have recently been applied in systematic studies of architectural orientations in the Maya area and in other parts of Mesoamerica.|$|E
5|$|For {{decades after}} the {{discovery}} of GRBs, astronomers searched for a counterpart at other wavelengths: i.e., any astronomical object in positional coincidence with a recently observed burst. Astronomers considered many distinct classes of objects, including white dwarfs, pulsars, supernovae, globular clusters, quasars, Seyfert galaxies, and BL Lac objects. All such searches were unsuccessful, {{and in a few}} cases particularly well-localized bursts (those whose positions were determined with what was then a high degree <b>of</b> <b>accuracy)</b> could be clearly shown to have no bright objects of any nature consistent with the position derived from the detecting satellites. This suggested an origin of either very faint stars or extremely distant galaxies. Even the most accurate positions contained numerous faint stars and galaxies, and it was widely agreed that final resolution of the origins of cosmic gamma-ray bursts would require both new satellites and faster communication.|$|E

To determine the final location of Flight 370, the BTO and BFO analyses were considered in combination with aircraft performance limitations, such as altitude, airspeed, and wind. The BFO analysis was able to isolate the Doppler shift between the aircraft and determine the relative motion of the aircraft to the satellite, which is reduced by the limited range of speeds at which the aircraft can fly and thus a limited set of speed/direction combinations exist that correlate with the calculated Doppler shifts.|$|E
5|$|The Solar System is chaotic over million- and billion-year timescales, {{with the}} orbits of the planets open to {{long-term}} variations. One notable example of this chaos is the Neptune–Pluto system, which lies in a 3:2 orbital resonance. Although the resonance itself will remain stable, it becomes impossible to predict the position of Pluto with any degree <b>of</b> <b>accuracy</b> more than 10–20million years (the Lyapunov time) into the future. Another example is Earth's axial tilt, which, due to friction raised within Earth's mantle by tidal interactions with the Moon (see below), will be incomputable at some point between 1.5 and 4.5 billion years from now.|$|E
5|$|Water clocks, or Fenjaan, in Persia {{reached a}} level <b>of</b> <b>accuracy</b> {{comparable}} to today's standards of timekeeping. The fenjaan {{was the most}} accurate and commonly used timekeeping device for calculating the amount or the time that a farmer must take water from a qanat or well for irrigation of the farms, until it was replaced by more accurate current clock. Persian water clocks were a practical and useful tool for the qanat's shareholders to calculate {{the length of time}} they could divert water to their farm. The qanat was the only water source for agriculture and irrigation so a just and fair water distribution was very important. Therefore, a very fair and clever old person was elected to be the manager of the water clock, and at least two full-time managers were needed to control and observe the number of fenjaans and announce the exact time during the days and nights.|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} goal in diagnostic medicine {{research is to}} estimate and compare the <b>accuracies</b> <b>of</b> diagnostic tests, which serve two purposes 1) providing reliable information about a patient’s condition and 2) influencing patient care.

We propose to give a gentle introduction to the statistical methods commonly used in diagnostic medicine covering some broad issues and scenarios. In particular, power calculations, estimation <b>of</b> the <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> a diagnostic test, comparison <b>of</b> <b>accuracies</b> <b>of</b> competing diagnostic tests, and regression analysis <b>of</b> diagnostic <b>accuracy</b> data will be discussed.
