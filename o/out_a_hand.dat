5|$|When Lincoln {{finds that}} the camera has not {{detected}} any motion, the group sets out into the forest once more. Wendy is dragged away by the shark and killed. The shark attacks Cameron, and Chapman shoots {{him in the head}} to end his pain. Hoffman and Mike soon join up with Chapman and Lincoln. Hoffman plans to start a large fire to attract the shark, as he surmises that the heat will confuse it, but it kills him before he can drop a lighter. Mike pulls <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> grenade but the shark bites off his legs, and Chapman and Lincoln make the decision to run away. The shark reappears and attempts to kill Mike, but he pulls the grenade's pin, causing them both to explode. After reporting the incident to the police station, Chapman and Lincoln see multiple shark fins in the snow and escape. Later, a woman named Daphne approaches Ethan's grave to lay a wreath, and a shark fin approaches her as she walks out of the graveyard.|$|E
5|$|Late in Friday's {{first season}} in Wales, Cardiff took on Luton Town on 16 April 1977. Cardiff {{were in the}} relegation zone and had not won in seven games, while Luton were fifth in the table and {{challenging}} for promotion. After clashing repeatedly early in the match with Luton goalkeeper Milija Aleksic, Friday was lectured by the referee for a high tackle on the goalkeeper in the 36th minute. Friday held <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> to apologise, but Aleksic reacted angrily. When the free kick was taken, Friday ran back, stole the ball from Luton defender John Faulkner, broke away, rounded Aleksic and slotted the ball past him into the net. In celebration, Friday jogged back past the goalkeeper while giving him the V-sign. Cardiff won the match 4–2 {{and at the end}} of the season avoided relegation to the third tier only on goal difference. Meanwhile, without Friday, Reading were relegated back to the Fourth Division by one point. Friday's actions became even stranger during his time at Cardiff; after they lost the second leg of the Welsh Cup final 3–0 to Shrewsbury Town on 18 May 1977, the players and staff were awoken in the middle of the night by loud bangs coming from below their rooms. The cause was found to be Friday, standing on the hotel's snooker table in his underpants and throwing the balls around the room in fury.|$|E
25|$|Essex's army, {{for want}} of {{material}} resources, had had to be content with the capture of Reading. A Royalist force under Hertford and Prince Maurice von Simmern (Rupert's brother) moved {{out as far as}} Salisbury to hold <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> to their friends in Devonshire. Waller, the only Parliamentary commander left in the field in the west, had to abandon his conquests in the Severn valley to oppose the further progress of his intimate friend and present enemy, Hopton.|$|E

25|$|Scenes of TVXQ posing {{with women}} are {{interspersed}} throughout the video. The duo are seen seducing the women by touching their faces, brushing up their legs and fingering up their arms. Halfway into the song, the video cuts into an animated dance break, with a solo dance by each member. Bebop music is played. After the break, {{the band and}} dancers freeze. Yunho snaps his fingers and they are brought back to motion. When the song ends, the duo walk back into the marble hallway. They stop by the portrait of the muses and is enamored by the muse in the middle, who reaches <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand.</b> They are then pulled into the painting. The video ends with TVXQ's tenth anniversary Tense logo.|$|E
500|$|England drew 0–0 {{in their}} opening group {{game of the}} World Cup against Uruguay after the South Americans came {{to play for a}} draw. They then beat Mexico 2–0 after a [...] "tremendous goal" [...] from Bobby Charlton opened up the game shortly before the half-time whistle. England beat France 2–0 in the final group game, with Charlton {{assisting}} Roger Hunt after heading the ball onto the post. England eliminated Argentina in the quarter finals with a 1–0 win – their efforts were greatly aided after Argentine centre-half Antonio Rattín was sent off for dissent, after which Argentina stopped attacking the ball and concentrated of holding out for a draw with their aggressive defending. England's opponents in the semi-finals were Portugal, who had giant centre-forward José Augusto Torres to compete with Charlton for aerial balls. Late in the game Charlton gave away a penalty by sticking <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> to stop Torres from scoring; Eusébio scored the penalty but was largely contained by Nobby Stiles, and England won the game 2–1 after two goals from Bobby Charlton.|$|E
2500|$|On October 29, {{this large}} vigilante band of some 250 men {{assembled}} and entered eastern Caldwell County. [...] When the Missourian raiders approached the settlement {{on the afternoon}} of October 30, some 30 to 40 Latter Day Saint families were living or encamped there. [...] Despite an attempt by the Mormons to parley, the mob attacked. [...] Thomas McBride surrendered his rifle to Jacob Rogers, who shot McBride with his own gun. [...] When McBride held <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand,</b> Rogers cut it off with a corn knife, then may have further mangled his body while McBride was still alive. [...] Other members of the mob opened fire, which sent the Latter-day Saints fleeing in all directions.|$|E

2500|$|These two poets {{have often}} been {{compared}} to each other. [...] To some extent this is because they were good friends and slightly older {{than most of the}} other leading members of their generation, as well as sharing similar career-paths, but they also seemed to share a similar approach to poetry. [...] Their poems often have a rarefied quality and tend not to deal with [...] "particulars", readily identifiable people and places. [...] However, they did differ in many respects as exemplified by the titles they gave to their published lectures on Spanish poetry. [...] At Johns Hopkins, Salinas published a collection called Reality and the Poet in Spanish Poetry, whereas Guillén’s Norton lectures were called Language and Poetry. [...] Both devoted single lectures to Góngora and San Juan de la Cruz and the comparisons between them are instructive. [...] Salinas seems to want to show us the poetic reality behind or beyond appearances, to educate us into how to see whereas Guillén gives us an account of the thoughts and sense-impressions going through his own mind: [...] the reader is a viewer of this process not a participant in it. [...] Vicente Aleixandre recalled visiting Salinas and finding him at his desk with his daughter on one knee and his son on the other and stretching <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> clutching a pen to shake hands with his visitor. [...] Although he was also devoted to his family, Guillén probably worked in a secluded study.|$|E
2500|$|On 19 February 2015, it was {{revealed}} West had already filmed his final scenes and left the show. Former Fawlty Towers star, Andrew Sachs, was announced to be joining the show on 10 March 2015 as Cyril Bishop, roommate of Stan when he is admitted to hospital. Sachs' first scenes were announced to air on 18 March 2015. Cyril died in the following episode, saddening Stan. Bradshaw-White teased Stan's exit week {{in an interview with}} Inside Soap, saying that Tina would take over Stan's care when Mick and Shirley become too embroiled in arguing to notice the pain he is going through. Discussing Stan's death, Bradshaw-White said, [...] "Stan has another one of his episodes and Tina just falls apart. So {{the rest of the family}} end up sending her home - they think she's not going to be able to cope with him dying. Tina goes back to The Vic thinking that she'll come in and see her dad again in the morning, but then he tragically dies that night." [...] Stan's final scenes aired on 10 April 2015 when after an emotional heart-to-heart with Shirley, he peacefully died in a hospice. Rather than the regular [...] "Doof Doofs" [...] that feature at the end of each episode, Fly Me to the Moon, as sung by Tony Bennett, was played over the credits in tribute to Stan. Following his on-screen exit, West spoke out in support of Prostate Cancer UK and signed up for the Men United campaign, [...] "Stan was probably the archetypal bad patient. He was very slow in thinking about his condition and recognising what it might be. He was slow to seek diagnosis, slow to act on the diagnosis and reluctant to see doctors. He was terrible really, something we should all look at and not do the same. What Men United seeks to do, and it's terribly important, is to hold <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> to people to say, 'Come on, you will see people here with whom you can swap experiences, swap ideas, swap thoughts, swap feelings'. You don't have to stand there and wait for people to come, because they won't. You just need a little push and you will like it when you get there." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fourth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), chapter [...] Judah left his {{brothers}} {{to live near}} an Adullamite named Hirah. Judah married {{the daughter of a}} Canaanite named Shua and had three sons named Er, Onan, and Shelah. Judah arranged for Er to marry a woman named Tamar, but Er was wicked and God killed him. Judah directed Onan to perform a brother's duty and have children with Tamar in Er's name. But Onan knew that the children would not be counted as his, so he spilled his seed, and God killed him as well. Then Judah told Tamar to remain a widow in his house until Shelah could grown up, thinking that if Tamar wed Shelah, he might also die. Later, when Judah's wife died, he went with his friend Hirah to his sheep-shearers at Timnah. When Tamar learned that Judah had gone to Timnah, she took off her widow's garments and put on a veil and sat on the road to Timnah, for she saw that Shelah had grown up and Judah had not given her to be his wife. Judah took her for a harlot, offered her a young goat for her services, and gave her his signet and staff as a pledge for payment, and they cohabited and she conceived. Judah sent Hirah to deliver the young goat and collect his pledge, but he asked about and did not find her. When Hirah reported to Judah that the men of the place said that there had been no harlot there, Judah put the matter to rest {{so as not to be}} put to shame. About three months later, Judah heard that Tamar had played the harlot and become pregnant, and he ordered her to be brought forth and burned. When they seized her, she sent Judah the pledge to identify, saying that she was pregnant by the man whose things they were. Judah acknowledged them and said that she was more righteous than he, inasmuch as he had failed to give her to Shelah. When Tamar delivered, one twin – whom she would name Zerah – put <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> and the midwife bound it with a scarlet thread, but then he drew it back and his brother – whom she would name Perez – came out. The fourth reading ( [...] , aliyah) and a closed portion ( [...] , setumah) end here with the end of chapter ...|$|E
