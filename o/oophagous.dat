To protect its sensitive brain and eyes from the temperature changes accompanying these movements, the bigeye thresher has a vascular exchange system called the rete mirabile around those organs. This species feeds mainly on fish and squid, which are stunned via whip-like strikes of the long tail. Bigeye threshers are ovoviviparous, usually bearing litters of two pups. The embryos are <b>oophagous</b> and feed on ova produced by the mother while inside the uterus.

It has been assessed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
50|$|The {{crocodile}} shark is aplacental viviparous and typically {{gives birth to}} litters of four, two pups to each uterus. The gestation period is unknown but believed to be long. The embryos have yolk sacs at 3 - 4 cm (1.2 - 1.6 in) long; once the yolk sac is fully absorbed they become oophagous: the mother produces large numbers of thin-walled egg capsules that contain 2 - 9 eggs each, which are then consumed by the unborn embryos. The abdomens of the embryos become characteristically distended with ingested yolk material, which can make up {{a quarter of the}} embryo's total weight. It is unclear how two {{crocodile shark}} fetuses manage to share a single uterus, when in some other <b>oophagous</b> mackerel sharks such as the sand tiger shark (Carcharias taurus), only one fetus survives in each uterus. The pups are born at approximately 40 cm (16 in) long; males attain maturity at 74 - 110 cm (29 - 43 in) and females at 89 - 102 cm (35 - 40 in). There is no defined reproductive season.|$|E
5000|$|R. vampyrus is a phytotelm breeder {{and lays}} its eggs in small water-filled tree holes {{during the rainy}} seasons, {{generally}} 0.3-1.2 m above the ground. The eggs are laid in foam nests {{on the wall of}} the tree hole. Tadpoles develop from the non-pigmented eggs. The tadpoles are long and dark-brown in colour. Their tails are about three times as long as their bodies. The species shows an unusual tadpole mouthpart morphology unknown in other anurans, namely presence of a specific serrated horny arch on the upper jaw, and a pair of fang-like horny teeth on the lower jaw. The two keratinised hooks project forward, and are supported laterally by two similar sized fleshy papillae on the margin of the reduced lower labium. The species is named after these unusual [...] "fangs". These unique mouthparts indicate that the tadpoles are strictly feeding on eggs (<b>oophagous)</b> and the extra unfertilised eggs (specifically for food) are deposited by the mother frog in the water hole. This is an example of advanced parental care.|$|E
5000|$|No {{pregnant}} smalltooth sand tigers {{have ever}} been found; this species is presumed to be ovoviviparous as in other mackerel sharks. Villaviencio-Garayzar (1996) described a 3.6 m (11.8 ft) female from the Gulf of California that contained [...] "hundreds of ova" [...] in her right ovary, which would support the embryos being <b>oophagous.</b> Whether the embryos also cannibalize each other as in the grey nurse shark is unknown. The size at birth {{is estimated to be}} 1.0 - 1.1 m (3.3 - 3.6 ft). With a few recorded exceptions, juveniles are found in deep water and only adults are present above a depth of 200 m (660 ft); this may serve to reduce predation on young individuals by large, shallow-water predators such as the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias). Males mature at a length of 2.0 - 2.5 m (6.6 - 8.2 ft) and females at a length of 3.0 - 3.5 m (9.4 - 11.5 ft). Faint scars seen on some individuals may be related to courtship.|$|E
50|$|Like {{the rest}} of the {{mackerel}} sharks, the pelagic thresher is ovoviviparous. It gives birth to two pups at a time (rarely just one), one per uterus. With no defined breeding season, most adult females are pregnant throughout the year; the gestation period is uncertain, but has been suggested to be less than one year as in the common thresher. The developing embryos are sustained by a yolk sac until they are 12 cm (4.7 in) long, after which they are <b>oophagous</b> and feed on egg capsules produced by the mother. Each capsule measures about 55 mm (2.2 in) long and 12 mm (0.5 in) across, and contains 20 - 30 ova. Early stage embryos have specialized teeth for opening the capsules, while later-stage embryos have their teeth hidden and swallow the capsules whole, their teeth not becoming functional again until just after birth. No evidence of sibling cannibalism has been found as in the sand tiger shark (Carcharias taurus). Young pelagic threshers are born unusually large, up to 1.6 m (5.2 ft) long or 43% the length of the mother, which likely reduces predation on the newborns.|$|E
5000|$|Oophaga pumilio is an {{external}} breeder, {{and other species}} of the genus Oophaga are notable in the amphibian world for exhibiting {{a high degree of}} parental care. The strawberry poison frog has dual parental care. The males defend and water the nests, and the females feed the <b>oophagous</b> tadpoles their unfertilized eggs. Although both male and female contribute to parental care, females invest more heavily in terms of energy expenditure, time investment, and loss of potential reproduction. Females provide energetically costly eggs to the tadpoles for 6-8 weeks (until metamorphosis), remain sexually inactive during tadpole rearing, and care for only one clutch of four to 6 tadpoles at a time. The males, though, contribute the relatively [...] "cheap" [...] (in terms of energy) act of watering and protecting the eggs for a relatively short period (10-12 days), and can care for multiple nests at one time. The extreme maternal investment in their offspring {{is believed to be the}} result of high egg mortality. Only 5 - 12% of the clutch develops into tadpoles, so the female's fitness may be best increased by making sure those few eggs that form tadpoles survive.|$|E

40|$|Oophagy is a {{behavioural}} {{pattern that}} {{has been found in}} a large variety of predator species in the animal kingdom. In contrast to other modes of feeding, it is peculiar in that it involves the detection, capture and ingestion of immobile prey. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the evolutionary origin and persistence of this pattern, but they have rarely been tested. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the benefits of a heterospecific <b>oophagous</b> tactic over a non-oophageous diet in terms of biomass intake. To this end, stomach contents were gathered by flushing the stomachs of male and female Alpine newts (Mesotriton alpestris) found in forestry ruts (i. e. pools caused by traffic) during their reproductive period. Prey items were identified, classified into functional categories and their dry mass determined. Frog (Rana temporaria) eggs are valuable prey items that give a higher biomass intake to individuals foraging on them than on those relying on invertebrates. Both sexes of newts practice oophagy but frog eggs are a transient resource that is only available during a part of their aquatic phase. Consequently, the newts adjust their diet to invertebrate predation later in the season after the peak of the frogs' breeding season. Oophagy is thus facultative and not obligate in the study species. The correlated occurrence of prey and predator, similarities between frog eggs and mobile potential prey (tadpoles), and high resource intake are all in favour of the occurrence and persistence of an <b>oophagous</b> feeding tactic.

We also assessed if the predator and the parasitoids could impact the T. absoluta population dynamics. Combined use of T. achaeae and predators in tomato greenhouses has proven efficient in limiting T. absoluta population growth (better than predators alone). However, our findings suggest the importance of integrating the M. pygmaeus presence in the greenhouse tomato crop when using <b>oophagous</b> parasitoids for inundative biological control of T. absoluta, notably to ensure maximum efficacy of the parasitoids against T. absoluta both through (1) the inundative release, and (2) subsequent impact of parasitoids' offspring...|$|E
40|$|The {{persistent}} pods of the tree, Acacia caven that do {{not fall}} from the tree provide opportunities for {{the appearance of a}} diverse group of insects the following season. Such pods collected during the spring of 1999 in Chile were indehiscent with highly sclerified pod walls. In contrast, persistent pods collected in Uruguay after a wet winter and spring (2002) were partially dehiscent, inducing the deterioration of the woody pods, and consequently exposing the seeds. These persistent pods are a natural refuge for insect species, namely two bruchid beetles (Pseudopachymeria spinipes, Stator furcatus), one scolytidae (Dendroctonus sp), lepidopterous larvae, ant colonies (Camponotus sp), one species of <b>oophagous</b> parasitoid (Uscana espinae group senex), the gregarious larval-pupae parasitoid Monoksa dorsiplana (Pteromalidae) and two species of Horismenus spp. (Eulophidae). The patriline of M. dorsiplana is frequently formed by 1 son + 7 daughters...|$|E
40|$|Despite renewed {{interest}} in the biogeography and evolutionary history of Old World tree frogs (Rhacophoridae), this family still includes enigmatic frogs with ambiguous phyloge-netic placement. During fieldwork in four northeastern states of India, we discovered several populations of tree hole breeding frogs with <b>oophagous</b> tadpoles. We used molecular data, consisting of two nuclear and three mitochondrial gene fragments for all known rhacophorid genera, to investigate the phylogenetic position of these new frogs. Our analyses identify a previously overlooked, yet distinct evolutionary lineage of frogs that warrants recognition as a new genus and is here described as Frankixalus gen. nov. This genus, which contains the enigmatic ‘Polypedates ’ jerdonii described by Günther in 1876, forms the sister group of a clade containing Kurixalus, Pseudophilautus, Raorchestes,Mercurana and Beddomixalus. The distinctiveness of this evolutionary lineage is also corroborated by the external mor-phology of adults and tadpoles, adult osteology, breeding ecology, and life history features...|$|E
