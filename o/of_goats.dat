5|$|In 1992, Alan W. Gentry of the Natural History Museum, London {{divided the}} eight major subfamilies of Bovidae into two major clades {{on the basis}} of their {{evolutionary}} history: the Boodontia, which comprised only the Bovinae, and the Aegodontia, which consisted of the rest of the subfamilies. Boodonts have somewhat primitive teeth, resembling those of oxen, whereas aegodonts have more advanced teeth like those <b>of</b> <b>goats.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sheep {{and goats}} are closely related: both {{are in the}} {{subfamily}} Caprinae. However, they are separate species, so hybrids rarely occur, and are always infertile. A hybrid of a ewe and a buck (a male goat) is called a sheep-goat hybrid (only a single such animal has been confirmed), and {{is not to be}} confused with the sheep-goat chimera, though both are known as geep. Visual differences between sheep and goats include the beard <b>of</b> <b>goats</b> and divided upper lip of sheep. Sheep tails also hang down, even when short or docked, while the short tails <b>of</b> <b>goats</b> are held upwards. Also, sheep breeds are often naturally polled (either in both sexes or just in the female), while naturally polled goats are rare (though many are polled artificially). Males of the two species differ in that buck goats acquire a unique and strong odor during the rut, whereas rams do not.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{after the}} victory the festival of the Agroteras Thysia ("sacrifice to the Agrotéra") {{was held at}} Agrae near Athens, in honor of Artemis Agrotera ("Artemis the Huntress"). This was in {{fulfillment}} of a vow made by the city before the battle, to offer in sacrifice a number <b>of</b> <b>goats</b> {{equal to that of}} the Persians slain in the conflict. The number was so great, it was decided to offer 500 goats yearly until the number was filled. Xenophon notes that at his time, 90 years after the battle, goats were still offered yearly.|$|E
40|$|Goat's milk today {{gets more}} and more attention. In {{comparison}} {{with other types of}} milk, the production <b>of</b> <b>goat's</b> milk increases the most. Although, the basic composition <b>of</b> <b>goat's</b> and cow's milk is very similar, goat's milk has an important dietetic and therapeutic advantages. In spite <b>of</b> that <b>goat's</b> milk is less explored. In this paper all main components <b>of</b> <b>goat's</b> milk and the somatic cells number are compared with cow's milk.

30|$|Meat {{products}} {{coming from}} such conditions often deteriorate due to bacterial contamination, especially in warm climates [8] like Malawi. Many researchers have isolated and identified heterogeneous types of microflora from fresh meat {{and this is}} backed by limited studies on carcass microbiological quality <b>of</b> <b>goat</b> meat appearing in literature [17]. So far, no studies have been reported on microbial quality <b>of</b> <b>goat</b> meat in Malawi. Therefore, {{this study was designed}} to assess the microbiological profile <b>of</b> <b>goat</b> carcasses and water used in both formal and informal slaughter slabs thereby evaluating sanitary quality <b>of</b> <b>goat</b> meat sold to consumers in Lilongwe, Malawi.|$|R
5|$|The {{next big}} {{headland}} is Foreland Point, {{after which the}} path comes to Lynmouth with the Lynton and Lynmouth Cliff Railway linking it with Lynton on the hill above.

Beyond Lynton the path passes through the Valley of the Rocks, known for its herd <b>of</b> <b>goats,</b> then Duty Point and Lee Bay, then Crock Point and Woody Bay. After Highveer Rocks the path crosses the small River Heddon then skirts Trentishoe Down and Holdstone Down and climbs Great Hangman.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the diverse}} bovid species occur in Africa. The maximum {{concentration}} is in the savannas of eastern Africa. Depending on their feeding habits, several species have radiated over large stretches of land, and hence several variations in dental and limb morphology are observed. Duikers inhabit the equatorial rainforests, sitatunga, and lechwe occur near swamps, eland inhabit grasslands, springbok and oryx occur in deserts, bongo and anoa live in dense forests, and mountain goats and takin live at high altitudes. A few bovid species also occur in Europe, Asia, and North America. Sheep and goats are found primarily in Eurasia, though the Barbary sheep and the ibex form part of the African fauna. The muskox is confined to the arctic tundra. Several bovid species have been domesticated by human beings. The domestication <b>of</b> <b>goats</b> and sheep began 10 thousand years ago, while cattle were domesticated about 7.5 thousand years ago.|$|E
5|$|The {{first record}} of Auriga's stars was in Mesopotamia as a {{constellation}} called GAM, representing a scimitar or crook. However, {{this may have}} represented just Capella (Alpha Aurigae) or the modern constellation as a whole; this figure was alternatively called Gamlum or MUL.GAM in the MUL.APIN. The crook of Auriga stood for a goat-herd or shepherd. It was formed {{from most of the}} stars of the modern constellation; all of the bright stars were included except for Elnath, traditionally assigned to both Taurus and Auriga. Later, Bedouin astronomers created constellations that were groups of animals, where each star represented one animal. The stars of Auriga comprised a herd <b>of</b> <b>goats,</b> an association also present in Greek mythology. The association with goats carried into the Greek astronomical tradition, though it later became associated with a charioteer along with the shepherd.|$|E
40|$|The quality {{characteristics}} of three groups <b>of</b> <b>goat</b> meat obtained from {{one year and}} three years old Anglonubian crossed native, and culled Saanen crossed native were investigated. Significant differences in fat, ash and total collagen content, were observed among groups <b>of</b> <b>goat</b> meat (P 0. 05) during storage. The influence <b>of</b> groups <b>of</b> <b>goat</b> meat on TBARS value was significantly observed (P< 0. 05) when processed in water and brine. Massaman curry could reduce the change in TBARS value <b>of</b> canned <b>goat</b> meat during storage.

40|$|The Bachelor thesis {{deals with}} {{composition}} <b>of</b> <b>goat</b> milk and effects influencing {{changes in the}} composition <b>of</b> <b>goat</b> milk. Goat milk is a product, quality of which is affected by {{a large number of}} factors. The outcome of this thesis is classified information about factors affecting the amount and composition <b>of</b> produced <b>goat</b> milk; the factors are divided into three main categories - biological factors, nutritional factors and factors of technology and management. Nutritional factors, in particular amount, quality and nutritional properties of feed and water, most affect the amount and composition of produced milk. Another essential factor is a genetic disposition which includes the individuality <b>of</b> the <b>goat,</b> its breed and pedigree. Among the other significant factors which affect quality <b>of</b> <b>goat</b> milk, we can classify health, age, lactation phase, technology and hygiene of milking, housing and treatment and a climate. Less important factor is e. g. earliness of weaning kids. All the factors are interconnected. Neglecting several less important factors can significantly negatively affect the composition <b>of</b> <b>goat</b> milk even though extraordinary care will be given to factors that are considered essential (and vice versa). Therefore it is important to take into consideration all factors involved, from the process <b>of</b> creation <b>of</b> <b>goat</b> milk to its manufacture...|$|R
40|$|In {{my thesis}} I discuss the {{evaluation}} <b>of</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>goat</b> milk coming from small-scale goat farmers. In the Czech Republic, goats have been bred for many years. Recently, goat milk {{is becoming more}} and more popular and is often searched by consumers as a type of food suitable for a healthy, balanced diet. The result of this is an increasing amount <b>of</b> <b>goat</b> farmers, especially those operating on smaller scale. In my thesis I describe the historical, as well as the current state <b>of</b> <b>goat</b> keeping in the Czech Republic and worldwide. The nutritional and dietary values <b>of</b> <b>goat</b> milk, its quality features and hygienic requirements are described as well. Also a part of the thesis is a laboratory evaluation of milk <b>of</b> two dairy <b>goats</b> kept at a small-scale farmer...|$|R
5|$|After {{an idyllic}} period, which is recounted {{in the first}} section of his Childhood Memories, Ion Creangă was sent to primary school, an {{institution}} then in the care of Orthodox Church authorities, where he became noted for his rebellious attitude and appetite for truancy. Among his colleagues was a female student, Smărăndița popii (known later as Smaranda Posea), for whom he developed an affection which lasted into his adult life, over decades in which the two no longer saw each other. He was taught reading and writing in Cyrillic alphabet through peer tutoring techniques, before the overseeing teacher, , was lassoed off the street and conscripted by the Moldavian military at some point before 1848. After another teacher, whom the Memories portray as a drunk, died from cholera in late 1848, David Creangă withdrew his grandson from the local school and took him to a similar establishment in Broșteni, handing him into the care of a middle-aged woman, Irinuca. Ion Creangă spent several months at Irinuca's remote house on the Bistrița River, before the proximity <b>of</b> <b>goats</b> resulted in a scabies infection and his hastened departure for Pipirig, where he cured himself using birch extract, a folk remedy mastered by his maternal grandmother Nastasia.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{aimed to}} {{elucidate}} whether CSN 1 S 2 protein <b>of</b> <b>goat's</b> milk {{was able to}} inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine [interleukin (IL) - 17 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α], RAGE, and caspase- 3 expression in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) rats. A total of 24 Wistar female rats, were randomly assigned into four groups: control group (C), CSN 1 S 2 protein <b>of</b> <b>goat's</b> milk group (CM), CFA-induced RA-rats group (RA), and the RA group treated by CSN 1 S 2 protein <b>of</b> <b>goat's</b> milk (RAM). The severity of erythema and swelling in lower extremities were counted by scoring. IL- 17, TNF-α, RAGE, and caspase- 3 expression in synovial membranes were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and western blotting. Erythema and swelling in the RA group was significantly attenuated by goat's milk CSN 1 S 2 (p    0. 05). Western blotting analysis showed that the expression of IL- 17, RAGE, TNF-α, and caspase- 3 {{were higher in the}} RA group compared with the control group. CSN 1 S 2 protein <b>of</b> <b>goat's</b> milk decreased RAGE and TNF-α expression, but increased the IL- 17 and caspase- 3 expression. In conclusion, CSN 1 S 2 protein <b>of</b> <b>goat's</b> milk decreased erythema, swelling, and inflammation in lower extremities. The CSN 1 S 2 protein <b>of</b> <b>goat's</b> milk also decreased TNF-α and RAGE expression in the synovial membrane of ankle joints. Unfortunately, CSN 1 S 2 protein <b>of</b> <b>goat's</b> milk may induce the production of IL- 17. Therefore CSN 1 S 2 protein <b>of</b> <b>goat's</b> milk may provide a nutritional therapy for attenuating the inflammation found in rheumatoid arthritis...|$|R
