40|$|BackgroundThe <b>osteoblastic</b> <b>bone</b> flare or {{response}} is the paradoxical phenomenon {{of increase in}} the quantity and/or density of bone lesions {{in the presence of}} well-documented disease response to treatment in other tumor sites. It results from the rapid repair and increased <b>osteoblastic</b> activity in <b>bone</b> metastases responding to therapy and therefore represents treatment efficacy. Nevertheless, no reliable markers can differentiate an osteoblastic flare or response from disease progression. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) <b>osteoblastic</b> <b>bone</b> flare or response has been reported in only a few patients. MethodsPre- and posttreatment CT scans of NSCLC patients with osteolytic bone lesions and treated with erlotinib as a single treatment modality were reviewed. ResultsIn 3 cases fulfilling these criteria and responding to erlotinib according to RECIST criteria, an <b>osteoblastic</b> <b>bone</b> response was found. With the increasing use of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients with NSCLC harboring mutations predicting a good response, the osteoblastic response will likely be increasingly seen. Awareness of this phenomenon with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors is important for physicians treating patients with NSCLC, so that it is not misinterpreted as progressive disease resulting in premature cessation of effective therapy...|$|R

40|$|Reduction {{in levels}} of sex hormones at {{menopause}} in women is associated with two common, major outcomes, the accumulation of white adipose tissue, and the progressive loss of bone because of excess osteoclastic <b>bone</b> resorption exceeding <b>osteoblastic</b> <b>bone</b> formation. Current antiresorptive therapies can reduce osteoclastic activity but have only limited capacity to stimulate <b>osteoblastic</b> <b>bone</b> formation and restore lost skeletal mass. Likewise, the availability of effective pharmacological weight loss treatments is currently limited. Here we demonstrate that conditional deletion of hypothalamic neuropeptide Y 2 receptors can prevent ongoing bone loss in sex hormone-deficient adult male and female mice. This benefit is attributable solely to activation of an anabolic <b>osteoblastic</b> <b>bone</b> formation response that counterbalances persistent elevation of bone resorption, suggesting the Y 2 -mediated anabolic pathway to be independent of sex hormones. Furthermore, the increase in fat mass that typically occurs after ovariectomy is prevented by germ line deletion of Y 2 receptors, whereas in male mice body weight and fat mass were consistently lower than wild-type regardless of sex hormone status. Therefore, this study indicates a role for Y 2 receptors in the accumulation of adipose tissue in the hypogonadal state and demonstrates that hypothalamic Y 2 receptors constitutively restrain osteoblastic activity {{even in the absence}} of sex hormones. The increase in bone formation after release of this tonic inhibition suggests a promising new avenue for osteoporosis treatment...|$|R

There is growing evidence that nutritional and food factors may play a part in the prevention of bone loss with aging and have been to be worthy of notice in the prevention of osteoporsis.

Mice with homozygous deletion of CaR mimic the syndrome of NSHPT. To determine effects of CaR deficiency on skeletal development and interactions between CaR and 1, 25 (OH) (2) D(3) or PTH on calcium and skeletal homeostasis, {{we compared the}} skeletal phenotypes of homozygous CaR-deficient (CaR(-/-)) mice to those of double homozygous CaR- and 1 α(OH) ase-deficient [CaR(-/-) 1 α(OH) ase(-/-) ] mice or those of double homozygous CaR- and PTH-deficient [CaR(-/-) PTH(-/-) ] mice at 2 weeks of age. Compared to wild-type littermates, CaR(-/-) mice had hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism, and severe skeletal growth retardation. Chondrocyte proliferation and PTHrP expression in growth plates were reduced significantly, whereas trabecular volume, osteoblast number, osteocalcin-positive areas, expression of the ALP, type I collagen, osteocalcin genes, and serum ALP levels were increased significantly. Deletion of 1 α(OH) ase in CaR(-/-) mice resulted in a longer lifespan, normocalcemia, lower serum phosphorus, greater elevation in PTH, slight improvement in skeletal growth with increased chondrocyte proliferation and PTHrP expression, and further increases in indices of <b>osteoblastic</b> <b>bone</b> formation. Deletion of PTH in CaR(-/-) mice resulted in rescue of early lethality, normocalcemia, increased serum phosphorus, undetectable serum PTH, normalization in skeletal growth with normal chondrocyte proliferation and enhanced PTHrP expression, and dramatic decreases in indices of <b>osteoblastic</b> <b>bone</b> formation. Our results indicate that reductions in hypercalcemia {{play a critical role}} in preventing the early lethality of CaR(-/-) mice and that defects in endochondral bone formation in CaR(-/-) mice result from effects of the marked elevation in serum calcium concentration and the decreases in serum phosphorus concentration and skeletal PTHrP levels, whereas the increased <b>osteoblastic</b> <b>bone</b> formation results from direct effects of PTH...|$|R

To investigate the role of Cthrc 1 in bone, we generated Cthrc 1 -null mice and transgenic mice which overexpress Cthrc 1 in osteoblasts (Cthrc 1 transgenic mice). Microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) and bone histomorphometry analyses showed that Cthrc 1 -null mice displayed low bone mass {{as a result of}} decreased <b>osteoblastic</b> <b>bone</b> formation, whereas Cthrc 1 transgenic mice displayed high bone mass by increase in <b>osteoblastic</b> <b>bone</b> formation.

In vitro, colony-forming unit (CFU) assays in bone marrow cells harvested from Cthrc 1 -null mice or Cthrc 1 transgenic mice revealed that Cthrc 1 stimulated differentiation and mineralization of osteoprogenitor cells.

40|$|The {{reciprocal}} {{interaction between}} cancer cells and the tissue-specific stroma {{is critical for}} primary and metastatic tumor growth progression. Prostate cancer cells colonize preferentially bone (osteotropism), where they alter the physiological balance between osteoblast-mediated bone formation and osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, and elicit prevalently an osteoblastic response (osteoinduction). The molecular cues provided by osteoblasts for the survival and growth of bone metastatic prostate cancer cells are largely unknown. We exploited the sufficient divergence between human and mouse RNA sequences together with redefinition of highly species-specific gene arrays by computer-aided and experimental exclusion of cross-hybridizing oligonucleotide probes. This strategy allowed the dissection of the stroma (mouse) from the cancer cell (human) transcriptome in bone metastasis xenograft models of human osteoinductive prostate cancer cells (VCaP and C 4 - 2 B). As a result, we generated the <b>osteoblastic</b> <b>bone</b> metastasis-associated stroma transcriptome (OB-BMST). Subtraction of genes shared by inflammation, wound healing and desmoplastic responses, and by the tissue type-independent stroma responses {{to a variety of}} non-osteotropic and osteotropic primary cancers generated a curated gene signature ("Core" OB-BMST) putatively representing the bone marrow/bone-specific stroma response to prostate cancer-induced, <b>osteoblastic</b> <b>bone</b> metastasis. The expression pattern of three representative Core OB-BMST genes (PTN, EPHA 3 and FSCN 1) seems to confirm the bone specificity of this response. A robust induction of genes involved in osteogenesis and angiogenesis dominates both the OB-BMST and Core OB-BMST. This translates in an amplification of hematopoietic and, remarkably, prostate epithelial stem cell niche components that may function as a self-reinforcing bone metastatic niche providing a growth support specific for osteoinductive prostate cancer cells. The induction of this combinatorial stem cell niche is a novel mechanism that may also explain cancer cell osteotropism and local interference with hematopoiesis (myelophthisis). Accordingly, these stem cell niche components may represent innovative therapeutic targets and/or serum biomarkers in <b>osteoblastic</b> <b>bone</b> metastasis...|$|R

This calibration factors for the three biggest spheres of the NEMA phantom allow to adapt the calibration factor for different lesion dimensions [30].

Transgenic overexpression of GPB 5 in mice results in cranial abnormalities, but the role of thyrostimulin in bone remains unknown. We hypothesized that thyrostimulin exerts paracrine actions in bone and determined: 1) GPA 2 and GPB 5 expression in osteoblasts and osteoclasts, 2) the skeletal consequences of thyrostimulin deficiency in GPB 5 knockout (KO) mice, and 3) osteoblast and osteoclast responses to thyrostimulin treatment.

While the mechanisms of aberrant AR activation in advanced prostate cancer have been extensively studied, the downstream AR target genes involved in the progression of castration resistance are largely unknown. Here, we identifyWNT 7 B as a direct AR target gene highly expressed in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells. Our results show that expression of WNT 7 B is necessary for the growth of prostate cancer cells and that this effect is enhanced under androgen-deprived conditions. Further analyses reveal that WNT 7 B promotes androgen-independent growth of CRPC cells likely through the activation of protein kinase C isozymes. Our results also show that prostate cancer-produced WNT 7 B induces osteoblast differentiation in vitro through a direct cell–cell interaction, and that WNT 7 B is upregulated in human prostate cancer xenografts that cause an osteoblastic reaction when grown in bone.

30|$|In the {{consideration}} of a potential implant insertion {{the need for a}} bone augmentation or a sinus lift needs to be considered as well. Although there are only very few cases in the literature with augmentation of bone/sinus lift [18, 28], these procedures are linked to a functioning vascular recipient site with working osteoclastic resorption and <b>osteoblastic</b> <b>bone</b> formation, and this is compromised in patients with antiresorptive therapy. Due to the denudation of the bone at the recipient site the vascular situation might be even more compromised, possibly resulting in more BP-ONJ cases so that any kind of augmentation should be considered with extreme care.|$|R

It is characteristically {{a disease of}} elderly men associated {{with the development of}} <b>osteoblastic</b> <b>bone</b> metastases and initial hormone responsiveness to androgen deprivation. Previously regarded as a Cinderella of cancers, there is currently more controversy concerning the detection and management of both localised and metastatic disease than for any other common malignancy. A balance needs to be drawn between the potential gains of more aggressive management and the disadvantages in terms of increased treatment side effects and cost, taking into account both the natural course of the disease and the life expectancy of patients...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOsteoporosis {{arises from}} an {{imbalance}} between <b>osteoblastic</b> <b>bone</b> formation and osteoclastic bone resorption. In this study, we screened molecules from marine natural products that stimulate osteoblast differentiation. We found that phorbaketal A significantly stimulates osteoblast differentiation in mesenchymal cells. Increased interaction of TAZ and Runx 2 stimulated phorbaketal A-induced expression of osteoblastic marker genes. The activation of ERK {{was important for}} the stimulation of differentiation because an inhibitor of ERK blocked phorbaketal A-induced osteogenic differentiation. Taken together, {{the results showed that}} phorbaketal A stimulates TAZ-mediated osteoblast differentiation through the activation of ERK.
