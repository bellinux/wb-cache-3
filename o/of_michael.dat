5|$|Early Bulgarian {{historian}} Petar Nikov {{suggested that}} despot Michael of the Donja Kamenica church is identical with Bulgarian tsar Michael Shishman (r. 1323–1330) who, before his accession to the throne, was despot of Vidin. However, Michael Shishman's father was named Shishman, not Michael, and was usually titled despot rather than tsar. In turn, Mavrodinov proposed {{the theory that}} despot Michael is an otherwise unknown son <b>of</b> <b>Michael</b> Shishman, who was installed as despot of Vidin by his father after his coronation in 1323. In any case, this unknown son <b>of</b> <b>Michael</b> Shishman was probably dead by 1331 because Belaur is mentioned as the ruler of Vidin shortly thereafter. The latter theory is the most established identification of despot Michael in Bulgarian historiography.|$|E
