40|$|Background: S 100 A 12 is an {{endogenous}} ligand of the receptor {{for advanced}} glycation end products (RAGE). Plasma S 100 A 12 levels {{are high in}} end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (HD). Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is common in HD patients and is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates in this population. To date, however, no study has specifically assessed the relationship between plasma S 100 A 12 and PAD in HD patients. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 152 HD patients in <b>our</b> <b>affiliated</b> hospital. We investigated PAD history and patient characteristics and quantified plasma S 100 A 12 levels in all participants. Results: HD patients with PAD (n = 26; 21. 9 [13. 6 – 33. 4] ng/ml) showed significantly higher plasma S 100 A 12 levels than HD patients without PAD (n = 126; 11. 8 [7. 5 – 17. 6]ng/ml; p Conclusion: These results suggest that plasma S 100 A 12 levels are strongly associated with PAD prevalence in ESRD patients undergoing HD...|$|R
40|$|Background: Coeliac {{disease has}} an {{increased}} pre-valence {{in a number}} of autoimmune endocrine conditions. An association between coeliac disease and Addison’s disease has been proposed in isolated case reports, but has not been formally studied. Aim: To investigate the extent of this association. Design: Prospective screening of patients with con-firmed Addison’s disease. Methods: From central computerized records, we identified all living patients with a diagnosis of auto-immune Addison’s disease in the past 30 years and presently attending <b>our</b> <b>affiliated</b> hospitals. After exclusions, 44 were invited to attend for screening. Results: Of 41 patients screened, five (12. 2 %) had coeliac disease: Three were previously diagnosed coeliacs and this was confirmed on review, includ-ing examination of biopsy material. A further two had positive IgA-endomysial antibodies. Histo-logical confirmation was obtained in both cases. Neither had laboratory or clinical evidence of malabsorption. Discussion: In this series of patients with Addison’s disease, a higher co-morbidity with coeliac disease was observed than in any previously studied endo-crine condition. We recommend that coeliac sero-logy (anti-endomysial and tissue transglutaminase antibody) testing be incorporated routinely into the autoimmune screen for other conditions in patients with Addison’s disease...|$|R

30|$|With {{institutional}} review board approval and waiver of informed consent from <b>our</b> <b>affiliated</b> university, we created a database of adult patients who successively underwent elective or emergent vascular surgery from 2005 – 2011 at a tertiary care Veterans Administration (VA) medical center using the VA integrated electronic health record, VISTA, International Classification of Diseases (ICD)- 9 diagnosis codes, and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes. For the current study, only cases whose administrative data indicated the use of monitored anesthesia care or regional anesthesia were included; documentation of general anesthesia or presence of an inhaled anesthetic agent on the intraoperative anesthetic record represented criteria for exclusion. We aggregated each patient’s demographic and preoperative prescription information. Details of surgery such as key timepoints (i.e., entry to operating room, surgical incision), procedural duration, the type of anesthesia (e.g., local/MAC or regional), and type of procedure were extracted from the electronic health record and used to identify eligible cases. After chart review, we grouped patients based on their use of preoperative β-blockers; patients with a documented active oral β-blocker prescription for ≥[*] 1  month before surgery {{were included in the}} β-blocker group while all others were included in the no β-blocker group. The present study employed methods similar to a previous study although the cases selected represented a distinct and separate sample and did not overlap with the sample used for the previous study (Mudumbai et al. 2012).|$|R
40|$|Develop and {{evaluate}} an electrochemical method to identify healthy individuals, malignant hematopathic patients and solid tumor patients by detecting the leukocytes in whole-blood. A total of 114 individual blood samples obtained from <b>our</b> <b>affiliated</b> hospital in China (June 2015 - August 2015) {{were divided into}} three groups: healthy individuals (n = 35), hematologic malignancies (n = 41) and solid tumors (n = 38). An electrochemical workstation system {{was used to measure}} differential pulse voltammetry due to the different electrochemical behaviors of leukocytes in blood samples. Then, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to analyze the scanning curves and to compare the peak potential and peak current. The scanning curve demonstrated the specific electrochemical behaviors of the blank potassium ferricyanide solution and that mixed with blood samples in different groups. Significant differences in mean peak potentials of mixture and shifts (ΔEp (mV)) were observed of the three groups (P< = 0. 001). 106. 00 ± 9. 00 and 3. 14 ± 7. 48 for Group healthy individuals, 120. 90 ± 11. 18 and 18. 10 ± 8. 81 for Group hematologic malignancies, 136. 84 ± 11. 53 and 32. 89 ± 10. 50 for Group solid tumors, respectively.

40|$|The {{increased}} use of ultrasonography in the management and evaluation of pregnancy has provided {{a unique opportunity to}} observe the anatomy of the developing fetus from 12 weeks gestation until term. Twenty-eight surgically important anatomic abnormalities have been diagnosed in utero by sonographic examinations at <b>our</b> <b>affiliated</b> institutions over the past three and a half years. These include ascites (five cases), gastroschisis (four cases), omphalocele (three cases), sacrococcygeal teratoma, cystic hygroma, hydrocele, duodenal atresia, multicystic kidney (two cases each), and one each of jejunal atresia, conjoined twins, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, urethral valves, urethral agenesis, and hydronephrosis secondary to reflux. Prenatal diagnosis by ultrasonographic examination has signifcantly improved perinatal management. Elective caesarean section has benefited infants with lesions causing dystocia, such as sacrococcygeal teratoma, omphalocele, and conjoined twins. Advance notification of surgeons and neonatalogists has reduced the delays of postnatal evaluation and treatment that contribute, significantly, to complications and death. In addition, transfer of the pregnant mother carrying an infant with a significant surgical anomaly to a center with facilities for neonatal surgery and specialized postoperative care can be properly planned for in advance. In the near future, intrauterine fetal surgery or palliative intervention may provide increased salvage of patients with obstructive uropathy and diaphragmatic hernia, both of which carry high mortality rates secondary to in utero damage. Sonography has proven useful in following the dilatation of either intestinal or urinary tract structures in utero. In our hands, maternal sonography has improved the surgical care of the newborn and may open a new frontier of intrauterine fetal surgery in the future...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{differences in}} the treatment strategies for ruptured aneurysms among 26 hospitals affiliated with Nagoya University and any changes in those strategies based on responses to a questionnaire. We also surveyed the data concerning patients with a ruptured aneurysm collected from <b>our</b> <b>affiliated</b> hospitals between 2001 and 2002. In half of the institutes, angiography is performed immediately after an urgent medical examination, there are only five hospitals (20 %) which have a basic policy of terminating the angiography within three to six hours after onset. In half of the institutes, {{the timing of the}} treatment also depends on the location of the aneurysm. In particular, the treatment for vertebro-basilar aneurysms tends to be done the next day or later. Low-grade subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients with mild symptoms tended not to be given any sedative drugs (46 %), while patients with SAH in some institutes were sedated without informed consent regardless of the severity. The main treatment method for most anterior circulation aneurysms was clipping. Concerning aneurysms located in the posterior circulation and the origin of the ophthalmic artery, clipping and coiling were equally selected. Almost all the hospitals (92 %) responded that their treatment strategy had not changed even after the report of the International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial (ISAT). There {{is a great deal of}} difference in treatment strategies and indications among institutions. In particular, institutions without neuroendovascular interventionists (NETists) frequently persist in the conventional policy, making it urgently necessary to bring NETists up-to-date on the latest advance in endovascular treatment...|$|R

The paper provides a snapshot summary of various activities and current proposals at Cal Poly, followed by referenced discussions on the question of why promote multidisciplinary education, the problems encountered, and possible organizational models. The paper ends with suggestions for next steps that include: completion of an inventory of existing activities; an analysis of the survey results to find points of convergence and potential opportunities; and creation of a task force, consisting of members who are well-informed of the literature and are interested in program transformation, to develop a strategic vision with goals and conceptual designs. Although the literature on multidisciplinary education is extensive, it is generally focused on case studies and barriers. Nonetheless, this review reveals important lessons worthy of our attention. These are: • Barriers to, and mechanisms for, multidisciplinary education are {{two sides of the same}} coin. • The various forms of multidisciplinary structures, as found in the literature, arise predominately from research-focused institutions. Our Cal Poly mission of teaching with <b>our</b> <b>affiliated</b> fiscal practices must be an acknowledged context when evaluating applicability of these structures. • Multidisciplinary activities are more successful if they also support other institutional priorities, and if there is commitment of leadership. • Multidisciplinary education presents us with a paradox. One must possess disciplinary expertise before one can contribute to, or learn effectively from, the multidisciplinary space. • Matrix organizations may be suitable for organizing multidisciplinary research. • A network of hubs, threads and roles may be best for organizing a multidisciplinary educational approach...|$|R
