5|$|In the {{ten years}} after the fall of Zaculeu various Spanish expeditions crossed into the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes and engaged in the gradual and complex conquest of the Chuj and Q'anjob'al. The Spanish were {{attracted}} to the region in the hope of extracting gold, silver and other riches from the mountains but their remoteness, the difficult terrain and relatively low population made their conquest and exploitation extremely difficult. The population of the Cuchumatanes is estimated to have been 260,000 before European contact. By the time the Spanish physically arrived in the region this had collapsed to 150,000 because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old World diseases that had run ahead of them.|$|E

This study was undertaken on 277 students of economics faculty of semarang state university as the samples using propotional random sampling. In addition, the data collection technique used was a questionnaire, then the data were analyzed by path analysis. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study showed that there were 21. 7 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> effectof personality towards the entrepreneurial interest, 18 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> adversity quotient toward <b>the</b> student’s entrepreneurial interest, 57 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> self efficacy towards <b>the</b> student’s entrepreneurial interest, 49 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> personality towards <b>the</b> self efficacy, 20. 2 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> adversity quotient towards <b>the</b> self efficacy, 27. 9 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> personality through self efficacy towards the students’ entrepreneurial interest, and 11. 5 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> adversity quotient through <b>the</b> self efficacy towards the entrepreneurial interest.

5|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Livonian Crusade in the Baltic was the {{introduction}} of stone and brick fortifications. Although {{there were hundreds of}} wooden castles in Prussia and Livonia, the use of bricks and mortar was unknown in the region before the Crusaders. Until the 13th century and start of the 14th centuries, their design was heterogeneous, however this period saw the emergence of a standard plan in the region: a square plan, with four wings around a central courtyard. It was common for castles in the East to have arrowslits in the curtain wall at multiple levels; contemporary builders in Europe were wary of this as they believed it weakened the wall. Arrowslits did not compromise the wall's strength, {{but it was not until}} Edward I's programme of castle building that they were widely adopted in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Arlene then {{entered the}} Gulf of Mexico later that {{afternoon}} and strengthened further to its peak strength of 70mph (110km/h). The official forecast at this time called for further intensification to minimal hurricane strength. This did not occur however and Arlene instead weakened as result of dry air entering the circulation. The storm made landfall just west of Pensacola, Florida in the afternoon of June 11 as a moderate tropical storm with winds of 60mph (95km/h). As most of the convection of the storm were located north and east of the center, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm were on land long before it made landfall. Arlene was the most intense landfalling June storm since Hurricane Allison hit the same location as a strong tropical storm during the 1995 season. Arlene weakened into a tropical depression later that day, but managed to persist as a tropical system as it moved north over the United States. The storm finally became extratropical on June 13 just northeast of Flint, Michigan and was absorbed by a larger system the next day.|$|E

5|$|As the {{inception}} of the United Nations as an intergovernmental entity slowly began formalizing in 1944, delegates from 44 of its early member states met at a hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire for the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference, now commonly referred to as the Bretton Woods conference. Delegates remained cognizant <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Depression, struggles to sustain the international gold standard during the 1930s, and related market instabilities. Whereas previous discourse on the international monetary system focused on fixed versus floating exchange rates, Bretton Woods delegates favored pegged exchange rates for their flexibility. Under this system, nations would peg their exchange rates to the U.S. dollar, which would be convertible to gold at $35 USD per ounce. This arrangement is commonly referred to as the Bretton Woods system. Rather than maintaining fixed rates, nations would peg their currencies to the U.S. dollar and allow their exchange rates to fluctuate within a 1% band of the agreed-upon parity. To meet this requirement, central banks would intervene via sales or purchases of their currencies against the dollar. Members could adjust their pegs in response to long-run fundamental disequillibria in the balance of payments, but were responsible for correcting imbalances via fiscal and monetary policy tools before resorting to repegging strategies. The adjustable pegging enabled greater exchange rate stability for commercial and financial transactions which fostered unprecedented growth in international trade and foreign investment. This feature grew from delegates' experiences in the 1930s when excessively volatile exchange rates and the reactive protectionist exchange controls that followed proved destructive to trade and prolonged the deflationary effects of the Great Depression. Capital mobility faced de facto limits under the system as governments instituted restrictions on capital flows and aligned their monetary policy to support their pegs.|$|E
5|$|To {{determine}} winds aloft, rawinsondes determine {{wind speed}} by GPS, radio navigation, or radar tracking of the probe. Alternatively, {{movement of the}} parent weather balloon position can be tracked from the ground visually using theodolites. Remote sensing techniques for wind include SODAR, Doppler lidars and radars, which can measure the Doppler shift of electromagnetic radiation scattered or reflected off suspended aerosols or molecules, and radiometers and radars {{can be used to}} measure the surface roughness of the ocean from space or airplanes. Ocean roughness can be used to estimate wind velocity close to the sea surface over oceans. Geostationary satellite imagery can be used to estimate the winds throughout the atmosphere based upon how far clouds move from one image to the next.

40|$|This study uses {{data from}} the National Longitudinal Survey <b>of</b> Youth to {{investigate}} <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> minimum drinking age laws (MDALs) on youth alcohol consumption. Two considerations motivated the analysis. First, results from previous studies provide conflicting evidence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> MDALs on alcohol consumption. Second, all previous studies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> MDALs on alcohol consumption have failed to control for unmeasured time-varying state effects. This study addresses this latter issue by using a difference-in-differences-in-differences (DDD) methodology. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> this study were mixed. On the one hand, a preponderance <b>of</b> estimates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> MDALs on alcohol consumption are negative, although many are {{not significantly different from}} zero. On the other hand, estimates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> MDALs differ by gender and exhibit some variation across samples and methods. In the end, I believe the estimates presented in this article are not sufficient to draw a definitive conclusion and suggest the need for additional research.
