5|$|MYCN <b>oncogene</b> {{amplification}} {{within the}} tumor {{is a common}} finding in neuroblastoma. The degree of amplification shows a bimodal distribution: either 3- to 10-fold, or 100- to 300-fold. The presence of this mutation is highly correlated to advanced stages of disease.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{experimental}} therapies for endometrial cancer under research, including immunologic, hormonal, and chemotherapeutic treatments. Trastuzumab (Herceptin), an antibody against the Her2 protein, {{has been used}} in cancers known to be positive for the Her2/neu <b>oncogene,</b> but research is still underway. Immunologic therapies are also under investigation, particularly in uterine papillary serous carcinoma.|$|E
40|$|Evidence for {{the direct}} {{involvement}} {{of a family}} of genes, designated <b>oncogenes,</b> in human tumorigenesis is rapidly accumulating. Several of the <b>oncogenes</b> iden-tified to date have been associated with specific forms of human cancer. <b>Oncogenes</b> are believed to cause tu-morigenesis either individually or by acting in concert; the interaction of oncogene-encoded proteins possibly accounts for the multistage nature of cancer. As the rate of discovery of new <b>oncogenes</b> has decreased markedly over the past few years, it is currently ex-pected that the total number of <b>oncogenes</b> will not ex-pand much beyond 30. <b>Oncogenes</b> are present in the human genome as nor-mal cellular genes (proto-oncogenes) with normal cel-lular functions. Proto-oncogene amino acid sequence...|$|R
50|$|Most normal cells {{will undergo}} a {{programmed}} form of rapid cell death (apoptosis) when critical functions are altered and malfunctioning. Activated <b>oncogenes</b> can cause those cells designated for apoptosis {{to survive and}} proliferate instead. Most <b>oncogenes</b> began as proto-oncogenes, normal genes involved in cell growth and proliferation or inhibition of apoptosis. If normal genes promoting cellular growth, through mutation, are up-regulated, (gain of function mutation) they will predispose the cell to cancer and are thus termed <b>oncogenes.</b> Usually multiple <b>oncogenes,</b> along with mutated apoptotic and/or tumor suppressor genes will all act in concert to cause cancer. Since the 1970s, dozens of <b>oncogenes</b> {{have been identified in}} human cancer. Many cancer drugs target the proteins encoded by <b>oncogenes.</b>|$|R
40|$|Transplacental {{exposure}} of rats {{to a single}} dose of the direct acting carcinogen methylnitrosourea (MNU) results in the induction {{of a variety of}} neoplasias of neuroectodermal, epithelial, and mesenchymal origin. Molecular analysis of the <b>oncogenes</b> present in these tumors revealed a striking degree of tissue specificity. neu <b>oncogenes</b> were found to be reproducibly activated in tumors derived from the peripheral nervous system (PNS), but not in those arising from the central nervous system (CNS). No ras <b>oncogenes</b> were found in either PNS- or CNS-derived tumors. However, Ha-ras <b>oncogenes</b> were detected in each of three mammary carcinomas and Ki-ras <b>oncogenes</b> were present in each of five kidney mesenchymal tumors. These results illustrate that phenotypic expression of activated <b>oncogenes</b> in vivo is not a random process and suggest that normal developmental programs may {{play an important role in}} modulating the activation of specific <b>oncogenes</b> by chemical carcinogens. PCR analysis revealed that each of the ras <b>oncogenes</b> detected in these transplacentally induced tumors became activated by the same G [...] A transition in the second base of codon 12. Since G [...] A transitions are the preferred mutations induced by MNU, it is likely that these ras <b>oncogenes</b> may have been directly targeted by MNU during embryonic development...|$|R
5|$|Base J (beta-d-glucopyranosyloxymethyluracil), a {{modified}} form of uracil, {{is also found}} in several organisms: the flagellates Diplonema and Euglena, and all the kinetoplastid genera. Biosynthesis of J occurs in two steps: in the first step, a specific thymidine in DNA is converted into hydroxymethyldeoxyuridine; in the second, HOMedU is glycosylated to form J. Proteins that bind specifically to this base have been identified. These proteins appear to be distant relatives of the Tet1 <b>oncogene</b> that is involved in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia. J appears to act as a termination signal for RNA polymerase II.|$|E
5|$|PTEN and p27 loss of {{function}} mutations {{are associated with a}} good prognosis, particularly in obese women. The Her2/neu <b>oncogene,</b> which indicates a poor prognosis, is expressed in 20% of endometrioid and serous carcinomas. CTNNB1 (beta-catenin; a transcription gene) mutations are found in 14–44% of endometrial cancers and may indicate a good prognosis, but the data is unclear. Beta-catenin mutations are commonly found in endometrial cancers with squamous cells. FGFR2 mutations are found in approximately 10% of endometrial cancers, and their prognostic significance is unclear. SPOP is another tumor suppressor gene found to be mutated in some cases of endometrial cancer: 9% of clear cell endometrial carcinomas and 8% of serous endometrial carcinomas have mutations in this gene.|$|E
25|$|Chromothripsis {{has been}} seen to cause <b>oncogene</b> {{amplification}}, amplification of <b>oncogene</b> containing regions {{and the loss of}} tumour suppressors.|$|E
50|$|The {{expression}} of <b>oncogenes</b> can be regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs), small RNAs 21-25 nucleotides in length that control gene expression by downregulating them. Mutations in such microRNAs (known as oncomirs) {{can lead to}} activation of <b>oncogenes.</b> Antisense messenger RNAs could theoretically be used to block the effects of <b>oncogenes.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Oncogenes</b> have {{previously}} {{been reported in}} the DNAs of mouse fibroblast lines which had become transformed after in vitro exposure to the carcinogen 3 -methylcholanthrene. These <b>oncogenes</b> are now shown to be versions of the cellular Kirsten ras gene and are therefore homologous to <b>oncogenes</b> detected in a variety of human tumor DNAs...|$|R
40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) {{are small}} noncoding RNAs which play {{essential}} roles in many important biological processes. Therefore, their dysfunction {{is associated with}} a variety of human diseases, including cancer. Increasing evidence shows that miRNAs can act as <b>oncogenes</b> or tumor suppressors, and although there is great interest in research into these cancerassociated miRNAs, little is known about them. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of putative human miRNA <b>oncogenes</b> and tumor suppressors. We found that miRNA <b>oncogenes</b> and tumor suppressors clearly show different patterns in function, evolutionary rate, expression, chromosome distribution, molecule size, free energy, transcription factors, and targets. For example, miRNA <b>oncogenes</b> are located mainly in the amplified regions in human cancers, whereas miRNA tumor suppressors are located mainly in the deleted regions. miRNA <b>oncogenes</b> tend to cleave target mRNAs more frequently than miRNA tumor suppressors. These results indicate that these two types of cancer-associated miRNAs play different roles in cancer formation and development. Moreover, the patterns identified here can discriminate novel miRNA <b>oncogenes</b> and tumor suppressors {{with a high degree of}} accuracy. This study represents the first large-scale bioinformatic analysis of human miRNA <b>oncogenes</b> and tumor suppressors. Our findings provide help for not only understanding of miRNAs in cancer but also for the specific identification of novel miRNAs as miRNA <b>oncogenes</b> and tumor suppressors. I...|$|R

50|$|Martin Zenke’s {{research}} {{focuses on}} the transcriptional regulation of gene expression. In 1986 {{he and his colleagues}} showed that transcriptional enhancers exhibit a modular structure and are composed of individual elements, which on their own are rather weak but act in synergy, and thereby build up enhancer activity. In 1988 Martin Zenke started to work on retroviral <b>oncogenes,</b> in particular on the v-erbA and v-rel <b>oncogenes.</b> His laboratory constructed a series of <b>oncogenes</b> that could be switched on and off at will. These conditional <b>oncogenes</b> were used to study differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells into red blood cells and antigen presenting dendritic cells.|$|R
50|$|The {{affected}} {{genes are}} divided into two broad categories. <b>Oncogenes</b> are genes that promote cell growth and reproduction. Tumor suppressor genes are genes that inhibit cell division and survival. Malignant transformation can occur through the formation of novel <b>oncogenes,</b> the inappropriate over-expression of normal <b>oncogenes,</b> or by the under-expression or disabling of tumor suppressor genes. Typically, changes in multiple genes are required to transform a normal cell into a cancer cell.|$|R
40|$|The {{conversion}} of cells from a normal phenotype to full malignancy apparently requires multiple genetic events. Efforts to reconstruct multistep tumorigenesis in cell culture {{have shown that}} two types of <b>oncogenes</b> (typified by HRAS and MYC) can cooperate to elicit complete transformation. Transformation of embryonic rodent cells by single <b>oncogenes</b> is reputed either not to occur or to require specialized circumstances. It has not been known how the large group of <b>oncogenes</b> that encode protein-tyrosine kinases might fit into this scheme. We now report that v-src, a prototype for the kinase <b>oncogenes,</b> can convert rat embryo fibroblasts to a fully transformed and tumorigenic phenotype when the gene is expressed vigorously. By contrast, v-src had no demonstrable effect on diploid human fibroblasts. Our results sustain the view {{that it is possible}} for at least some <b>oncogenes</b> to achieve a potency sufficient for unilateral tumorigenesis...|$|R
25|$|In 1975 the {{functioning}} of oncoviruses was clarified considerably. Until that time, {{it was thought that}} these viruses carried certain genes called oncogenes which, when inserted into the host's genome, would cause cancer. Michael Bishop and Harold Varmus showed that the <b>oncogene</b> of Rous sarcoma virus is in fact not specific to the virus but is contained in the genome of healthy animals of many species. The oncovirus can switch this pre-existing benign proto-oncogene on, turning it into a true <b>oncogene</b> that causes cancer.|$|E
25|$|An <b>oncogene</b> is a {{gene that}} is mutated or {{expressed}} at high levels, and thus helps turn a normal cell into a tumor cell. In the late 1970s, Robert Weinberg {{and his team of}} researchers began the search for a human <b>oncogene.</b> Using gene transfer techniques, researchers in his lab inserted DNA from human bladder tumor cells into normal animal cells. When the animal cells turned cancerous, Dr. Weinberg's associates began inserting smaller pieces of DNA into the normal cell. By 1980, they found a single fragment that turned the normal cell cancerous. This gene was found to belong to a sub-family of related genes, called ras, that was later discovered {{to play a role in}} causing bladder, lung, and colon cancer in both rats and humans. More results emerged in 1982 when Dr. Weinberg's laboratory discovered that a single, subtle genetic glitch in this <b>oncogene</b> topples the delicate balance between a bladder cell's normal and cancerous states.|$|E
25|$|Although c-Raf is {{very clearly}} capable of mutating into an <b>oncogene</b> in {{experimental}} settings, {{and even in}} a few human tumors, its brethren kinase B-Raf is the true major player in carcinogenesis in humans.|$|E
25|$|Comparative oncogenomics uses cross-species {{comparisons}} to identify <b>oncogenes.</b> This research involves studying cancer genomes, transcriptomes and proteomes in model organisms such as mice, identifying potential <b>oncogenes</b> and referring back to human cancer samples {{to see whether}} homologues of these <b>oncogenes</b> are important in causing human cancers. Genetic alterations in mouse models {{are similar to those}} found in human cancers. These models are generated by methods including retroviral insertion mutagenesis or graft transplantation of cancerous cells.|$|R
