They were not allowed to return until 1945.|$|E

Inscriptions mention guilds of weavers, oilmen, artisans, basket and mat makers and fruit sellers. A Saundatti inscription refers to an assemblage <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> of a district headed by the guilds of the region. Some guilds were considered superior to others, just as some corporations were, and received royal charters determining their powers and privileges. Inscriptions suggest these guilds had their own militia to protect goods in transit and, like village assemblies, they operated banks that lent money to traders and businesses.|$|E

25|$|It is {{possible}} for schizophrenia to develop at any age, but it mostly happens to people within the ages of 16–30 (generally males 16–25 and females 25–30) - about 75 percent of people living with the illness develop it at this age. There is a likelihood of children developing schizophrenia, though it is quite rare {{before the age of}} 12. Also, new cases are uncommon after age 40. In addition, about 1 percent of the world's population will develop schizophrenia over their lifetime, therefore out <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> born, one in 100 will develop schizophrenia by age 55. There is on average a somewhat earlier onset for men than women, with the possible influence of the female hormone estrogen being one hypothesis and sociocultural influences another.|$|E
25|$|To ensure {{his control}} over the new class of governors, Naresuan decreed that all freemen subject to phrai service had become phrai luang, bound {{directly}} to the king, who distributed {{the use of their}} services to his officials. This measure gave the king a theoretical monopoly on all manpower, and the idea developed that since the king owned the services <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>people,</b> he also possessed all the land. Ministerial offices and governorships—-and the sakdina that went with them—-were usually inherited positions dominated by a few families often connected to the king by marriage. Indeed, marriage was frequently used by Thai kings to cement alliances between themselves and powerful families, a custom prevailing through the nineteenth century. As a result of this policy, the king's wives usually numbered in the dozens.|$|E
