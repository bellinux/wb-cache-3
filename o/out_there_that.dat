25|$|James Harmon Brown and Barbara Esensten, {{new head}} {{writers of the}} series, were {{reluctant}} to state whether or not Havins would be departing the soap opera. In their interview with TV Guide, the two remained ambiguous about the matter, though hinting at a recast. Barbara Esensten commented:It’s <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>that</b> we will probably lose her, and it certainly isn’t our choice. However, we’re still writing the show as if she’s not leaving. If we should have to recast Babe, we’ll help the actor take over the part by writing specifically for the new actor like what we did with the Greenlee recast. We saw some little things in Sabine Singh (Greenlee), so we wrote for her accordingly, but you get into real trouble when you completely change the character for a recast. Luckily, Jim and I don’t have any trouble separating the actor from a character because the latter is really paramount in our eyes.|$|E

I don't understand why pop stars are put on such a high pedestal over other celebrities. Why do members of Parliament feel that they need to scrutinize her for having a gun, and 'She's in the public,' and 'She should know better,' and 'She's a role model,' but what about every other celebrity out there? What about every other actor? That's very strange to me. I was really surprised at how much the gun use was scrutinized. [...] a professional criminal, so it makes sense he has a gun.

Both Jaffe and Barlog said that the reason God of War II appeared on the PlayStation 2 instead of the PlayStation 3—which was released four months prior to God of War II—was because [...] "there's a 100 million people <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>that</b> will be able to play God of War II as soon as it launches."

While advocating for the bill in a committee hearing, Wolf admitted “it never occurred to me that there were that many businesses <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>that</b> didn't offer this as a benefit,” and referred to the experience as “an eye-opener.” Although the proposal eventually expired without being passed, for reasons Wolf described as a compromise with the legislature having already passed an incremental minimum wage increase, he campaigned for a ballot measure in 2014 which would mandate universal employee sick time.|$|E

500|$|Though {{the initial}} {{growth of the}} fandom {{may have come from}} 4chan {{participants}} enjoying the ironic nature of grown men enjoying a show for girls, the fandom continues to grow based on sincere appreciation of the work.

Prof. Roberta Pearson of the University of Nottingham in film and television studies stated that [...] "This is a level of fan devotion I've not seen before," [...] while Prof. Charles Soukup of the University of Northern Colorado in communication studies suggested that this effort is an indication of the [...] "ultra-cult era" [...] that bronies exhibit, where [...] "media consumers discover extremely unexpected and obscure media texts to cultivate uniqueness and distinctiveness for their mediated identities".|$|E
