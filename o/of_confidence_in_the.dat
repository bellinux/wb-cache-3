5|$|In a {{referendum}} {{called by the}} National Council, and held {{on the same day}} as {{the second round of the}} presidential election, the electorate voted to overturn a law providing for the nationalization of citizens' share in the major national insurance company. Nearly three quarters of the votes were cast against the law. After both election and referendum results were announced, the Prime Minister Janez Janša announced that he might resign, following what he perceived to be a heavy defeat for the Government. The Government later won a vote <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> National Assembly.|$|E
5|$|Owing {{to a lack}} <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> local currency, the US {{dollar is}} widely {{accepted}} as a medium of exchange alongside the Somali shilling. Dollarization notwithstanding, the large issuance of the Somali shilling has increasingly fueled price hikes, especially for low value transactions. This inflationary environment, however, is expected {{to come to an}} end as soon as the Central Bank assumes full control of monetary policy and replaces the presently circulating currency introduced by the private sector.|$|E
5|$|Executive {{power is}} {{exercised}} by the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers {{which make up}} the government, while the legislative power is vested in the unicameral parliament, the Grand National Assembly of Turkey. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature, and the Constitutional Court is charged with ruling on the conformity of laws and decrees with the constitution. The Council of State is the tribunal of last resort for administrative cases, and the High Court of Appeals for all others. The prime minister is elected by the parliament through a vote <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> government and is most often {{the head of the}} party having the most seats in parliament. The prime minister is Binali Yıldırım, who replaced Ahmet Davutoğlu on 24 May 2016.|$|E

5|$|Initially, President Grinius {{refused to}} resign, {{but he was}} {{eventually}} persuaded that Polish invasion was imminent and that Smetona had sworn to uphold the constitution. On 19 December 42 delegates of the Seimas met (without the Social Democrats or the Peasant Popular Union) and elected Aleksandras Stulginskis as the new Speaker of the Seimas. Stulginskis was the formal head of state {{for a few hours}} before Smetona was elected as the President (38 deputies voted for, two against, and two abstained). The Seimas also passed a vote <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new cabinet formed by Voldemaras. Constitutional formalities were observed thereby. The Lithuanian National Union secured other major roles: Antanas Merkys assumed office as Minister of Defense and Ignas Musteikis as Minister of the Interior.|$|E
5|$|Mahler {{had been}} {{convinced}} {{from the start}} of the work's significance; in renouncing the pessimism that had marked much of his music, he offered the Eighth as an expression <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eternal human spirit. In the period following the composer's death, performances were comparatively rare. However, from the mid-20th century onwards the symphony has been heard regularly in concert halls all over the world, and has been recorded many times. While recognising its wide popularity, modern critics have divided opinions on the work; Theodor W. Adorno, Robert Simpson and Jonathan Carr found its optimism unconvincing, and considered it artistically and musically inferior to Mahler's other symphonies. Conversely, it has also been compared—by Deryck Cooke—to Ludwig van Beethoven's Symphony No.9 as a defining human statement for its century.|$|E
5|$|As the Sole Survivor {{gradually}} expands their influence, tape {{recordings and}} journal entries reveal that despite its popularity, Nuka-World was under threat from serious mismanagement {{in the weeks}} and months prior to the Great War. Gradually, John-Caleb Bradberton, the creator of Nuka-Cola and the architect of Nuka-World, is revealed to have redirected resources to fund Project Cobalt, a weapons development project for the United States military. This culminated in the creation of Nuka-Cola Quantum, a variation of Nuka-Cola made with radioactive isotopes. In exchange for his support, the military agreed to include Bradberton in LEAP-X, an attempt to artificially prolong life; however, Braxton, the general in charge of Project Cobalt, saw Bradberton's prediction of an imminent war as a lack <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> military, and thus betrayed him. When the Sole Survivor accesses Bradberton's office, they discover a hidden elevator leading to a private Vault. Inside is Bradberton's still-living head attached to a life support machine, a punishment by Braxton for doubting the military. The player is given the choice of shutting off the power and euthanizing Bradberton at his request, or keeping him alive for the sake of Sierra Petrovita, a recurring character from Fallout 3 who idolises Bradberton.|$|E

In June 1985, business magnate Robert Maxwell announced a takeover of Sinclair Research, through Hollis Brothers, a subsidiary of his Pergamon Press. However the deal was aborted in August 1985.|$|E
