Factors such as stochastic evolutionary forces acting on genes involved in organelle biogenesis, organelle-nuclear gene interactions, and physical limitations may, to varying degrees, dictate the selective constraint that per-cell organelle number is under.

Rfo, a nuclear gene that restores male fertility, alters the expression of Orf 138 at the post-transcriptional level. The Ogura CMS/Rfo two-component system is a useful model for investigating nuclear–cytoplasmic interactions, {{as well as the}} physiological basis of fertility restoration. Using a combination of positional cloning and microsynteny analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana and radish, we genetically and physically delimited the Rfo locus to a 15 -kb DNA segment. Analysis of this segment shows that Rfo {{is a member of the}} pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) family.

In this process, a massive transfer of genes from the genome of the endosymbiont {{to the nuclear}} genome of the host cell occurred. Whereas intron-free <b>organellar</b> <b>genes</b> could conceivably enter the nucleus as DNA pieces and become functional nuclear genes, the transfer mechanisms of <b>organellar</b> <b>genes</b> containing prokaryotic-type group I or group II introns are not clear. ResultsWe describe an experimental system {{that allows us to}} screen for functional endosymbiotic gene transfer of intron-containing chloroplast genes to the nuclear genome. To distinguish between DNA-mediated and RNA/complementary DNA-mediated transfer, we have constructed an antibiotic resistance gene that is interrupted by a chloroplast group II intron and whose expression is dependent upon both intron removal and gene transfer from the chloroplast genome to the nuclear genome. Screening chloroplast-transformed tobacco plants for the acquisition of the antibiotic resistance via gene transfer to the nucleus, a large number of transfer events were selected. We show that all events involved the direct DNA-mediated transfer of the intron-containing chloroplast gene into the nuclear genome. Gene activity in the nucleus is brought about by utilization of cryptic splice sites within chloroplast intron sequences resulting in appearance of a contiguous reading frame. ConclusionOur data pinpoint mechanisms for the functional transfer of <b>organellar</b> <b>genes</b> to the nucleus and demonstrate that intron possession is not an insurmountable obstacle to DNA-mediated endosymbiotic gene transfer...|$|R

These interactions result in large expressosome-like assemblies that we termed mitochondrial organization of gene expression (MIOREX) complexes.

40|$|The Arabidopsis thaliana nuclear genome {{sequence}} revealed several open reading frames encoding proteins {{related to}} group II intron-encoded reverse transcriptase/maturases. Here, we show via sequence alignments {{that at least}} four such open reading frames are conserved in the nuclear genomes of A. thaliana and Oryza sativa (rice) and that they encode putative proteins belonging to two different classes (nMat- 1 and nMat- 2), neither of which {{is associated with a}} group II intron RNA structure. The two nMat- 1 proteins have reverse transcriptase, maturase and DNA endonuclease domains characteristic of canonical group II intron-encoded proteins, while the two nMat- 2 proteins have reverse transcriptase and maturase domains linked to a novel C-terminal domain. Although some nMat proteins have mutations expected to inactivate intron mobility functions, all could potentially retain the RNA splicing function. These nuclear maturase-like proteins may be imported into organelles to function in group II intron splicing and/or they may have assumed other cellular functions.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{intracellular}} signaling from chloroplast to nucleus plays a vital role in stress responses to survive environmental perturbations. The chloroplasts were proposed as sensors to heat stress since components of the photosynthetic apparatus housed in the chloroplast are the primary susceptible targets of thermal damage in plants. Thus, communicating subcellular perturbations to the nucleus is critical during exposure to extreme environmental conditions such as heat stress. By coordinating expression of stress specific nuclear genes essential for adaptive responses to hostile environment, plants optimize different cell functions and activate acclimation responses through retrograde signaling pathways. Such diverse metabolic and biosynthetic functions require efficient communication between plastids and the nucleus. In recent years several putative retrograde signals released from plastids that regulate nuclear genes have been identified and signaling pathways have been proposed. In this review, we provide an update on retrograde signals derived from tetrapyrroles, carotenoids, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and <b>organellar</b> <b>gene</b> expression (OGE) in the context of heat stress responses and address their roles in retrograde regulation of heat-responsive gene expression, systemic acquired acclimation and cellular coordination in plants...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Because organellar genomes {{are often}} unipa-rentally inherited, {{chloroplast}} (cp) and mitochondrial (mt) DNA polymorphisms {{have become the}} markers of choice for investigating evolutionary issues such as sex-biased dispersal and the directionality of introgression. To the extent that organellar inheritance is strictly maternal, {{it has also been}} suggested that the insertion of transgenes into either the chloroplast or mitochondrial genomes would reduce the likelihood of gene escape via pollen flow from crop fields into wild plant populations. In this paper we describe the adaptation of chloroplast simple sequence repeats (cpSSRs) for use in the Com-positae. This work resulted in the identification of 12 loci that are variable across the family, seven of which were further shown to be highly polymorphic within sunflower (Helianthus annuus). We then used these markers, along with a novel mtDNA restriction fragment length poly-morphism (RFLP), to investigate the mode of organellar inheritance in a series of experimental crosses designed to mimic the initial stages of crop-wild hybridization in sunflower. Although we cannot rule out the possibility of extremely rare paternal transmission, our results provide the best evidence to date of strict maternal organellar inheritance in sunflower, suggesting that <b>organellar</b> <b>gene</b> containment may be a viable strategy in sunflower.

40|$|During the {{evolution}} of the eukaryotic cell, plastids and mitochondria arose from an endosymbiotic process, which determined the presence of three genetic compartments into the incipient plant cell. After that, these three genetic materials from host and symbiont suffered several rearrangements, bringing on a complex interaction between nuclear and <b>organellar</b> <b>gene</b> products. Nowadays, plastids harbor a small genome with ~ 130 genes in a 100 - 220 kb sequence in higher plants. Plastid genes are mostly highly conserved between plant species, being useful for phylogenetic analysis in higher taxa. However, intergenic spacers have a relatively higher mutation rate and are important markers to study genetic diversity and divergence within natural plant populations. The predominant uniparental inheritance of plastids is like a highly desirable feature for phylogeny studies. Moreover, the gene content and genome rearrangements are efficient tools to capture and understand evolutionary events between different plant species. Currently, genetic engineering of the plastid genome (plastome) offers a number of attractive advantages as high-level of foreign protein expression, marker-gene excision, gene expression in operon and transgene containment because of maternal inheritance of plastid genome in most crops. Therefore, plastid genome can be used for adding new characteristics related to synthesis of metabolic compounds, biopharmaceutical and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses.

However, Doyle (1997) notes that when the history of the organellar genome is {{different from that of the}} nuclear genome (e.g. in lineage sorting or introgression) every comparison sequence in these genomes will give a false phylogenetic pattern for those taxa, and this can confound phylogenetic reconstruction.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{roles of}} non-coding RNAs in {{regulating}} gene expression have been extensively studied in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, however few reports exist {{as to their}} roles in <b>organellar</b> <b>gene</b> regulation. Evidence for accumulation of natural antisense RNAs (asRNAs) in chloroplasts comes from the expressed sequence tag database and cDNA libraries, while functional data have been largely obtained from artificial asRNAs. In this study, we used Nicotiana tabacum to investigate the effect on sense strand transcripts of overexpressing a natural chloroplast asRNA, AS 5, which is complementary to the region which encodes the 5 S rRNA and tRNA Arg. Results AS 5 -overexpressing (AS 5 ox) plants obtained by chloroplast transformation exhibited slower growth and slightly pale green leaves. Analysis of AS 5 transcripts revealed four distinct species in wild-type (WT) and AS 5 ox plants, and additional AS 5 ox -specific products. Of the corresponding sense strand transcripts, tRNA Arg overaccumulated several-fold in transgenic plants whereas 5 S rRNA was unaffected. However, run-on transcription showed that the 5 S- trnR region was transcribed four-fold more in the AS 5 ox plants compared to WT, indicating that overexpression of AS 5 was associated with decreased stability of 5 S rRNA. In addition, polysome analysis of the transformants showed less 5 S rRNA and rbcL mRNA associated with ribosomes. Conclusions Our results suggest that AS 5 can modulate 5 S rRNA levels, giving it the potential to affect Chloroplast translation and plant growth.

Members of the “mitochondrial transcription termination factor” (mTERF) family, which are present in both metazoans and plants, are involved in <b>organellar</b> <b>gene</b> expression. Arabidopsis thaliana contains 35 mTERF proteins, of which mTERF 10, mTERF 11, and mTERF 12 were previously assigned to the “chloroplast-associated” group. Here, we show that all three are localized to chloroplast nucleoids, which are associated with PGE. Knock-down of MTERF 10, MTERF 11, or MTERF 12 has no overt phenotypic effect under normal growth conditions. However, in silico analysis of MTERF 10, - 11, and - 12 expression levels points to a possible involvement of mTERF 10 and mTERF 11 in responses to abiotic stress. Exposing mutant lines for 7 days to moderate heat (30 °C) or light stress (400 μmol photons m− 2 s− 1) fails to induce a phenotype in mterf mutant lines. However, growth on MS medium supplemented with NaCl reveals that overexpression of MTERF 11 results in higher salt tolerance. Conversely, mterf 10 mutants are hypersensitive to salt stress, while plants that modestly overexpress MTERF 10 are markedly less susceptible. Furthermore, MTERF 10 overexpression leads to enhanced germination and growth on MS medium supplemented with ABA. These findings point to an involvement of mTERF 10 in salt tolerance, possibly through an ABA-mediated mechanism. Thus, characterization of {{an increasing number of}} plant mTERF proteins reveals their roles in the response, tolerance and acclimation to different abiotic stresses...|$|E

Cis-elements for two PPR genes and several RNA editing sites were analyzed for sequence changes by pairwise nucleotide substitution frequency, pairwise indel frequency, and maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic distances. All three of these analyses demonstrated that sequences within the cis-element are highly conserved compared with surrounding sequences. In addition, we have compared sequences around chloroplast editing sites and homologous sequences in species that lack an editing site due to the presence of a genomic T. Cis-elements for RNA editing sites are highly conserved in angiosperms; by contrast, comparable sequences around a genomically encoded T exhibit higher rates of nucleotide substitution, higher frequencies of indels, and greater ML distances. The loss in requirement for editing to create the ndhD start codon has resulted in the conversion of the PPR gene responsible for editing that site to a pseudogene. We show that organellar dependence on nuclear-encoded PPR proteins for gene expression has constrained the evolution of cis-elements that are required at the level of RNA processing. Thus, the expansion of the PPR gene family in plants has had a dramatic effect on the evolution of plant organelle genomes...|$|E
40|$|Genes for {{mitochondrial}} and chloroplast proteins {{are distributed}} between the nuclear and organellar genomes. Organelle biogenesis and metabolism, therefore, require appropriate coordination of gene {{expression in the}} different compartments to ensure efficient synthesis of essential multiprotein complexes of mixed genetic origin. Whereas organelle-to-nucleus signaling influences nuclear gene expression at the transcriptional level, <b>organellar</b> <b>gene</b> expression (OGE) {{is thought to be}} primarily regulated posttranscriptionally. Here, we show that intracompartmental and intercompartmental transcriptional networks coordinate the expression of genes for organellar functions. Nearly 1, 300 ATH 1 microarray-based transcriptional profiles of nuclear and organellar genes for mitochondrial and chloroplast proteins in the model plant Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) were analyzed. The activity of genes involved in organellar energy production (OEP) or OGE in each of the organelles and in the nucleus is highly coordinated. Intracompartmental networks that link the OEP and OGE gene sets serve to synchronize the expression of nucleus- and organelle-encoded proteins. At a higher regulatory level, coexpression of organellar and nuclear OEP/OGE genes typically modulates chloroplast functions but affects mitochondria only when chloroplast functions are perturbed. Under conditions that induce energy shortage, the intercompartmental coregulation of photosynthesis genes can even override intracompartmental networks. We conclude that dynamic intracompartmental and intercompartmental transcriptional networks for OEP and OGE genes adjust the activity of organelles in response to the cellular energy state and environmental stresses, and we identify candidate cis-elements involved in the transcriptional coregulation of nuclear genes. Regarding the transcriptional regulation of chloroplast genes, novel tentative target genes of σ factors are identified. ...|$|E
40|$|The complex gene {{expression}} mechanisms {{that occur in}} plant mitochondria, such as RNA editing and splicing, are not yet well understood. RNA editing in higher plant mitochondria is a highly specific process which modifies mRNA sequences by C-to-U conversions. It {{has been suggested that}} in some cases this process is required for splicing. Here, we use an experimental model based on the introduction of DNA into isolated mitochondria by electroporation to study <b>organellar</b> <b>gene</b> expression events. Our aim was to compare processing and editing of potato small ribosomal protein 10 gene (rps 10) transcripts in heterologous (wheat mitochondria) and homologous (potato mitochondria) contexts. rps 10 is a suitable model because it contains a group II intron, is absent in wheat mitochondria but is actively expressed in potato mitochondria, where transcripts are spliced and undergo five C-to-U editing events. For this purpose, conditions for electroporating isolated potato mitochondria were established. rps 10 was placed under the control of either potato or wheat cox 2 promoters. We found that rps 10 was only transcribed under the control of a cognate promoter. In wheat mitochondria, rps 10 transcripts were neither spliced nor edited while they are correctly processed in potato mitochondria. Interestingly, a wheat editing site grafted into rps 10 was not recognized by wheat mitochondria but was correctly edited in potato mitochondria. Taken together, these results suggest that editing might occur only when the transcripts are engaged in processing and {{that they would not be}} available to editing factors outside of a putative RNA maturation machinery complex...|$|E
40|$|Group II intron self-splicing is {{essential}} for correct expression of <b>organellar</b> <b>genes</b> in plants, fungi, and yeast, {{as well as of}} bacterial genes. Self-excision of these autocatalytic introns from the primary RNA transcript is achieved in a two-step mechanism apparently analogous to the one of the eukaryotic spliceosome. The 2 '-OH of a conserved adenosine (the branch point) located within domain 6 (D 6) acts as the nucleophile in the first step of splicing. Despite the biological importance of group II introns, little is known about their structural organization and usage of metal ions in catalysis. Here we report the first solution structure of a catalytically active D 6 construct encompassing the branch point and the neighboring helical regions from the mitochondrial yeast intron ai 5 . The branch adenosine is the single unpaired nucleotide, and, in contrast to the spliceosomal branch site, resides within the helix being partially stacked between the two flanking GU wobble pairs. We identified a novel prominent Mg 2 + binding site in the major groove of the branch site. Importantly, Mg 2 + addition does not impair stacking of the branch-adenosine, but in contrast rather strengthens the interaction with the flanking uridines, as shown by NMR- and fluorescence studies. This means, that domain 6 presents the branch adenosine in a stacked fashion to the core of group II introns upon folding to the active conformation...|$|R
40|$|The pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) {{gene family}} {{represents}} one of the largest gene families in higher plants. Accumulating data suggest that PPR proteins play a central and broad role in modulating the expression of <b>organellar</b> <b>genes</b> in plants. Here we report a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant named young seedling albino (ysa) derived from the rice thermo/photoperiod-sensitive genic male-sterile line Pei'ai 64 S, which is a leading male-sterile line for commercial two-line hybrid rice production. The ysa mutant develops albino leaves before the three-leaf stage, but the mutant gradually turns green and recovers to normal green at the six-leaf stage. Further investigation showed that the change in leaf color in ysa mutant is associated with changes in chlorophyll content and chloroplast development. Map-based cloning revealed that YSA encodes a PPR protein with 16 tandem PPR motifs. YSA is highly expressed in young leaves and stems, and its expression level is regulated by light. We showed that the ysa mutation has no apparent negative effects on several important agronomic traits, such as fertility, stigma extrusion rate, selfed seed-setting rate, hybrid seed-setting rate, and yield heterosis under normal growth conditions. We further demonstrated that ysa can be used as an early marker for efficient identification and elimination of false hybrids in commercial hybrid rice production, resulting in yield increases by up to approximately 537 kg ha− 1...|$|R
40|$|Plant variegations are {{characterized}} {{by the presence of}} white sectors in normally green tissues and organs. Whereas the white sectors contain defective plastids that lack coloured pigments, the green sectors contain morphologically normal chloroplasts. Variegation mutants are defective in chloroplast developmental processes and arise due to mutations in nuclear or <b>organellar</b> <b>genes.</b> Despite their widespread occurrence in nature, only a few variegations have been studied at the molecular level. In this review, recent progress toward understanding two Arabidopsis variegations, immutans (im) and var 2 is summarized. Both im and var 2 are caused by nuclear recessive mutations and the responsible genes have been cloned and characterized. IMMUTANS functions as a chloroplast terminal oxidase that transfers electrons from the plastoquinol pool to oxygen. It appears to be a versatile electron sink, especially early in chloroplast development, when its function is crucial for carotenoid biosynthesis, and in excess light, when it serves as a ‘safety valve’. IM also probably functions in chlororespiration. VAR 2 encodes a chloroplast FtsH metalloprotease (termed AtFtsH 2). Along with other AtFtsH proteins (AtFtsH 1, 5 and 8), it forms complexes in the thylakoid membrane that are probably involved in the process of PSII repair during photoinhibition. A model has been proposed to explain the mechanism of var 2 variegation, which suggests that threshold levels of FtsH complexes are required for green sector formation. It is concluded that studies on im and var 2 have provided novel insights into nuclear–chloroplast interactions and, especially, into mechanisms of photoprotection...|$|R
