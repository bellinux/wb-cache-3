5|$|Historians {{generally}} {{give credit}} to Colonel Noel Parrish, Commander of Tuskegee Field from 1942 to 1946, for his enlightened leadership and fair treatment of cadets which improved morale by reducing the amount <b>of</b> <b>segregation</b> and overcrowding and improving relations with both blacks and whites {{in the town of}} Tuskegee. The record of the Airmen became a driving force for President Harry S Truman's decision to desegregate the U.S. military in 1948.|$|E

The {{following}} 35 governors of Arkansas, ruling for a total of 90 years, were all Democrats, until Republican Winthrop Rockefeller became governor in 1966 defeating James D. Johnson. Winthrop became governor while his brother Nelson was governor of New York, while the defeat of Johnson in Arkansas and William M.

5|$|One notable {{section of}} Riverside is Silvertown, a {{subdivision}} developed in 1887 for African Americans. Initially isolated from largely white Riverside to the east, it was eventually {{absorbed into the}} growing neighborhood. As such, Silvertown residents became some of the few black plantation house owners in Riverside through the period <b>of</b> <b>segregation.</b> A few one-story wood-frame houses in the area may date to the original development, including one pantation house owned by a woman and then her daughter from 1887 into the 1980s.|$|E

The three strategies [...] fair-share plans, exclusionary zoning lawsuits, and community housing audits [...] are reviewed and analyzed in terms of their potential success in reducing involuntary segregation.

5|$|Connecticut was {{selected}} as {{a participant in the}} 2009 International Bowl following a 7–5 regular season where they won their first five games, only to lose five of their last seven contests. Facing the Huskies were the Buffalo Bulls with a regular season record of 8–5, highlighted by an upset win over then-No.12 and undefeated Ball State in the 2008 MAC Championship Game. Pre-game media coverage focused on the legacy of the 1958 Buffalo Bulls, the first team from the university to be invited to a bowl game. When told that the two African-American members of the team {{would not be allowed to}} play because <b>of</b> <b>segregation,</b> the team elected to refuse the bowl bid.

5|$|During Franklin's administration, Eleanor {{became an}} {{important}} connection to the African-American population in the era <b>of</b> <b>segregation.</b> Despite the President's desire to placate Southern sentiment, Eleanor was vocal in her support {{of the civil rights}} movement. After her experience with Arthurdale and her inspections of New Deal programs in Southern states, she concluded that New Deal programs were discriminating against African-Americans, who received a disproportionately small share of relief moneys. Eleanor became one of the only voices in the Roosevelt White House insisting that benefits be equally extended to Americans of all races.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two main}} {{features}} <b>of</b> non-equilibrium <b>segregation,</b> by which it is most easily distinguished from equilibrium segregation. In the non-equilibrium effect, the magnitude <b>of</b> the <b>segregation</b> increases with increasing temperature and the alloy can be homogenized without further quenching because its lowest energy state corresponds to a uniform solute distribution. In contrast, the equilibrium segregated state, by definition, is the lowest energy state {{in a system that}} exhibits equilibrium segregation, and the extent <b>of</b> the <b>segregation</b> effect decreases with increasing temperature. The details <b>of</b> non-equilibrium <b>segregation</b> {{are not going to be}} discussed here, but can be found in the review by Harries and Marwick.|$|R

The standard case in this area, Re London Wine Co (Shippers) Ltd, was distinguished because the subject matter there was potentially different, while all of Moss's shares were identical.

5|$|Long {{interested}} in an administrative role, White {{was the leading}} candidate for principal of the neglected Roberts Vaux Consolidated School. In 1864, he was appointed principal, the first black person in Philadelphia to assume such a role. Originally housed in the poorly ventilated basement of the Zoar Methodist Church, under White's leadership, the Vaux school moved to the building formerly housing the William D.

5|$|Moss was {{the founder}} and {{director}} of Moss Electrical Co Ltd, and owned 950 of the 1,000 available shares. In September 1986 he said that Hunter, the finance director, could have 50 of these shares as part of his employment. Crucially, he made no statement or trust involving the other 900 shares. This gift of 50 shares was never implemented because of tax concerns, the risks of a takeover, and mainly because Moss changed his mind. Hunter brought a case against Moss claiming his 50 shares, which rested on two issues. First, whether the language used was sufficient to create a trust, and second, whether or not the trust failed to provide the three certainties because of the lack <b>of</b> <b>segregation</b> between the shares.|$|E

40|$|The {{relation}} between grain boundary segregation and hydrogen embrittlement of metals may be discussed from two stand points : 1 °) Hydrogen {{has a strong}} tendency to segregate in structure defects, among them, in grain boundaries. Hydrogen segregation controls the properties of hydrogenated materials in many cases (hydrogen diffusion, hydrogen induced cracking, electrical properties in semiconductors, etc) and more precisely their mechanical behaviour (embrittlement itself). 2 °) The occurence <b>of</b> grain boundary <b>segregations</b> <b>of</b> impurities and/or alloying elements may modify the hydrogen embrittlement behaviour of the material : synergetic effects <b>of</b> <b>segregations</b> (S, P, Sb, [...] .) and hydrogen on embrittlement, or, reversely, inhibiting effects <b>of</b> given <b>segregations</b> (carbon), on hydrogen induced grain boundary embrittlement. These two aspects are obviously linked as the grain boundary <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen {{is a function of}} possible interaction between hydrogen and other elements.
