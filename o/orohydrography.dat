40|$|One of {{the great}} goals of CTA is to bring {{together}} dispersed information and knowledge {{and to make it}} available to a large number of users. This is particularly important when dealing with the problems caused by the drought in the Sahel, which is why CTA published the first livestock atlas covering all the arid areas of the Sudan. CTA entrusted the task to CIRAD-EMVT which, since 1958, has mapped over 2. 0 m km 2 of the Sahel. French, British and Sudanese scientists pulled together their efforts in order to publish this atlas, which incorporates extensive data on livestock and their development. The atlas is a synthesis of livestock and pasture potential of the regions of the Sudan where rainfall averages between 70 and 500 mm per annum. The publication responds to a perceived need for this kind of information among national research services and decision-makers, as well as among international development and aid agencies. The atlas contains comprehensive information on animal-rearing and its development in a region where climatic conditions play a paramount role. It is a follow-up of a survey carried out, in French and under the sponsorship of CTA, of seven West African countries situated in dry tropical zones. It is part of a series which includes a compilation of the common climatic elements for an animal-rearing area spreading from the Atlantic to the Ethiopian border. The Sudan atlas covers twelve subjects which highlight two main themes. The first is a study of the environment and comprises the following topics: general presentation, phyto-geography and botany, climate and soils, feed resources, range use, cropping, water resources, pastoral production and economy and livestock movements. The second part deals with human activity, livestock resources, animal health and veterinary services. The study covers more than 800, 000 km 2. The atlas also contains an agro-pastoral map at 1 : 500, 000, in twelve sheets. The publication will provide planners with a reliable information source and agricultural authorities with an important tool for monitoring natural resources. Furthermore, this work helps to identify the information gaps that still need to be explored. Sudan, with an area of more than 2. 5 m km 2 is Africa's largest country. Its population has increased rapidly during the last 20 years. From 15 million inhabitants in 1970, it has grown to an estimated 27. 3 million today. Sudan controls only the middle section of the Nile but this river dictates the country's present and future patterns of land use and provides 96 % of the annual surface run-off (estimated at 136. 5 cubic km). The Sudanese economy is based primarily on agriculture and pastoralism. Together these contribute 35 % of GNP and employs 70 % of the labour force. Most of the livestock are raised under nomadic or semi-nomadic conditions but these herds men are gradually becoming settled and are increasingly turning to cultivation. The atlas contains 33 pages, of which 12 are devoted to a cartographical survey. It features the <b>orohydrography</b> of the region an essential data on climate, population distribution and economic factors. It includes two maps of the vegetation of Sudan, one based on the classification made by Harrison and Jackson in 1958 and the other made by IEMVT in 1986 - 1987. The use of aerial photography from the Landsat satellite complements this information. The atlas has been produced by the department of Livestock Production and Veterinary Medicine of the French-based Centre for International Cooperation in Agricultural Development Research (CIRAD-EMVT), in collaboration with the Range Pasture Administration of the Sudan. The section on water resources was produced by the Geological and Mining Research Bureau (BRGM). Several institutions have provided assistance to CIRAD-EMVT in the production of the atlas: in the United Kingdom the Natural Resources Institute (NRI), Overseas Development Administration (ODA), Durham University and Bangor University; in the Republic of Sudan, the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural and Animal Resources, the Forestry Department, and the Rural Water Department. The authors were A Durag, (DVM, Director, Range Pasture Administration) F El Moulah (Range Scientist, Range Pasture Administration), G. Forgiarini (Remote Sensing Specialist, CIRAD-EMVT), H I Khatab (DVM, Ministry of Agriculture and Natural and Animal Resources), G Lamarque (Cartographer, CIRAD-EMVT), M El Sammani (Socio-Economist, University of Khartoum), G Tacher (Director, CIRAD-EMVT), H Torrent (Hydrogeologist, BRGM) and G Uilenberg (Scientific Director - Animal Health, CIRAD-EMVT). The scientific editors were J C Bille (Range Ecologist) and R T Wilson (Animal Scientist/Natural Resources Ecologist). The technical production was carried out at CIRAD-EMVT. CTA provided financial support because of its mandate to disseminate scientific and technical information in order to aid the formulation of development strategies by ACP countries. The socio-economic importance of pastoralism in the Sudan, and the need to protect an exceptionally fragile ecosystem, were additional factors which led CTA to support this publication. atla...|$|E
40|$|In several past issues SPORE has {{featured}} atlases on {{the pastoral}} {{resources of the}} countries of the western Sahel (see box page 9). These have now been consolidated in a single atlas, which also deals thematically with various aspects of vegetation, water, resources, cattle and animal husbandry. The new volume Livestock and pastoral potential in the Sahel is a major work which draws together current information on the effects of drought on the 3 -way interdependence of man-animal-plant which always has been, and will continue to be, the basis of development of pastoralism. The atlas {{is the result of a}} joint project by CTA and IEMVT (Institut d'Elevage et de Medicine Veterinaire des Pays Tropicaux), and collates all the data collected by IEMVT over the last 40 years. This compendium contains all the available information on came-breeding and its evolution. It took six years to produce and is aimed at state technical services, regional organizations and funding agencies. The data covers an area of more than 3, 500, 000 km 2 (six times the size of France); it incorporates a synthesis of all available previously published work and takes into account findings in veterinary sciences and parasitology. The use of aerial photography from the Landsat satellite complements this information. Among the contributors were specialists in human geography and hydrogeologists from BRGM (Bureau de Recherches Geologiques et Minieres), as well as scientists from national institutions working on the development of pastoralism. The atlas contains more than 180 pages, of which 32 are devoted to a cartographical survey (scale 1 : 500, 000) of the pastoral vegetation of the whole western Sahelian zone, an area which receives an annual rainfall of between 150 and 600 mm. It features the <b>orohydrography</b> of the region, and essential data on climate, population distribution, and economic factors. The Atlas also provides an overview of plant species distribution based on field sampling of thousands of plants. A comparison between normal and drought rainfall levels is included to show the response of local vegetation to climatic variations. The keys to the agropastoral maps are both for reference and also to show a projection of how fodder production and carrying capacity may change according to variations in rainfall (since there can be no consideration of pasture without a simultaneous investigation of water). There is also a map showing deficiences in major and minor plant nutrients, and this constitutes the first step towards more detailed, larger-scale maps, which will facilitate more rational utilization of pasturelands. Starting with the wholly traditional scene of the 1950 s, the atlas includes a detailed overview of the situations encountered by ethnic groups of pastoralists over the past three decades. The response of pastoral people to the establishment of the new environmental order and its consequences for both nomadism and settled agriculture is described. Domestic animal breeds are categorized and described according to region using archive documents and numerous reference works which have been complemented by research done in the field. Livestock breeding and rearing is affected by the tsetse fly and the advances in the campaigns against this pest are detailed. The tsetse, various vectors of pathogens which affect both animals and man, and ticks and their distribution have a section devoted to them, with maps showing the influence of rainfall on the distribution of the various pest species. A preliminary summary of present knowledge on intestinal parasites is included. Finally, the organization and current state of the veterinary infrastructure in the relevant countries is analysed. In the Sahel the twin scourges of drought and rapid population growth demand solutions which will bring livestock production into line with agricultural development. The availability of this new atlas will spur decision makers and planners in their consideration of the fast-changing needs of this region. The text, covering such a variety of themes, demonstrates the complexity of the problems, the importance of a regional strategy, and the necessity of integrating research findings in order to facilitate the development of pastoralism and crop production. From this point of view scientists and students will benefit from the publication, which will provide them with both databank and food for thought. CTA's financial support for the book springs from its mandate to disseminate scientific and technical information in order to aid the formulation of the development strategies of ACP countries. The socio-economic importance of pastoralism in the Sahelian region and the need to protect an exceptionally fragile ecosystem amply justify CTA's choice of subject matter. CTA and IEMVT are continuing their collaboration in the preparation of two further atlases, on the pastoral resources of North Cameroon and Sudan, which will be published in the near future.
