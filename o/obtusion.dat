40|$|Today the {{technologies}} of trenchless reconstruction of pipelines are becoming and more {{widely used in}} Russia and abroad. One of the most perspective is methods is shock-free destruction of the old pipeline being replaced {{with the help of}} hydraulic installations with working mechanism representing a cutting unit with knife disks and a conic expander. A construction of a working mechanism, which allows making trenchless reconstruction of pipelines of different diameters, is optimized and patented and its developmental prototype is manufactured. The dependence of pipeline cutting force from knifes <b>obtusion</b> of the working mechanisms. The cutting force of old steel pipelines with obtuse knife increases proportional to the value of its <b>obtusion.</b> Two stands for endurance tests of the knifes in laboratory environment are offered and patented...|$|E
