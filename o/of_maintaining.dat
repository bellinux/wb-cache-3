5|$|After scalemaker Saxton {{left the}} Mint Service in 1844, {{much of the}} work <b>of</b> <b>maintaining</b> and modifying the {{sensitive}} balances for which Saxton was responsible fell to Peale. The Chief Coiner made a number of improvements to the scales, which he wrote up for an article in the Journal of The Franklin Institute in 1847. These balances, sensitive to , were protected by plate glass from air currents and dust.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} Raw arrived in South Vietnam there were {{tensions}} between the Army and RAAF over the employment of No. 9 Squadron, with the Army perceiving that the unit was not providing enough support to 1 ATF. Raw believed that the Task Force headquarters had unrealistic expectations as the Army officers {{did not understand the}} difficulty <b>of</b> <b>maintaining</b> and operating helicopters.|$|E

5|$|Brooke-Little {{maintained}} {{an interest in}} Irish heraldry even after he was promoted from Norroy and Ulster to Clarenceux. After the Director of the National Library of Ireland was made the Chief Herald of Ireland, Brooke-Little wrote to the Daily Telegraph of the importance <b>of</b> <b>maintaining</b> a strong tradition of heraldic and genealogical expertise in the Irish Office of Arms.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, the 5th and 8th King's (Liverpool Irish) {{received}} specialist {{training at}} Ayrshire {{in preparation for}} a planned invasion of France. They had been selected to form the nucleus of the 5th and 7th Beach Groups, which would have the objectives <b>of</b> <b>maintaining</b> beach organisation, securing positions, and providing defence against counter-attack.|$|E
5|$|In October 2016, the MetroWest Regional Transit Authority (MWRTA) {{took over}} {{management}} of the station from the MBTA under a lease agreement. The agreement relieves the MBTA from the cost <b>of</b> <b>maintaining</b> the station, while allowing the MWRTA to use parking revenue to construct bus shelters and additional parking areas. An additional parking lot was opened inside the wye {{on the north side}} of the station in August 2017.|$|E

5|$|Like {{the other}} services, the Congolese Air Force is {{not capable of}} {{carrying}} out its responsibilities. Few of the Air Force's aircraft are currently flyable or capable of being restored to service and {{it is unclear whether}} the Air Force is capable <b>of</b> <b>maintaining</b> even unsophisticated aircraft. Moreover, Jane's states that the Air Force's Ecole de Pilotage is 'in near total disarray' though Belgium has offered to restart the Air Force's pilot training program.|$|E
5|$|Not all inhibitors of {{oxidative}} phosphorylation are toxins. In brown adipose tissue, regulated proton channels called uncoupling proteins can uncouple respiration from ATP synthesis. This rapid respiration produces heat, and {{is particularly important}} as a way <b>of</b> <b>maintaining</b> body temperature for hibernating animals, although these proteins may also have a more general function in cells' responses to stress.|$|E
5|$|Paul's {{foreign policy}} of nonintervention made him the only 2008 Republican presidential {{candidate}} to have voted against the Iraq War Resolution in 2002. He advocates withdrawal from the United Nations, and from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, for reasons <b>of</b> <b>maintaining</b> strong national sovereignty.|$|E

The garrison, consisting of units from ground, naval and air forces, reports its command to the Central Military Commission.|$|E
5|$|The Environment Agency's {{long-term}} {{policy is}} {{to hold the line}} only to protect communities and infrastructure, with managed retreat as the solution to rising sea levels elsewhere, even at sites like Cley where the financial benefits from the recreational value of the reserve outweigh the cost <b>of</b> <b>maintaining</b> the sea defences. A scheme to allow tidal flooding of part of the reserve has already been implemented at Titchwell Marsh.|$|E
5|$|The F-22 {{is highly}} maneuverable at both {{supersonic}} and subsonic speeds. Computerized {{flight control system}} and full-authority digital engine control (FADEC) make the aircraft highly departure resistant and controllable. The Raptor's relaxed stability and powerful thrust-vectoring engines enable the aircraft to turn tightly and perform very high alpha (angle of attack) maneuvers such as the Herbst maneuver (J-turn) and Pugachev's Cobra. The aircraft is also capable <b>of</b> <b>maintaining</b> over 60° alpha while having some roll control.|$|E

5|$|The ease <b>of</b> <b>maintaining</b> {{these birds}} in captivity {{has made them}} popular for {{studying}} behavior and physiology. Feeding behavior can be predicted by the optimal foraging theory, where animals minimize time and energy spent to maximize food intake. This theory has been tested by studying the strategies used by scaly-breasted munias to increase their feeding efficacy.|$|E
5|$|The five {{versions}} of the Lost World Pyramid were each larger than the previous version. They were not built directly centred upon the preceding version due to the necessity <b>of</b> <b>maintaining</b> the E-Group plaza area between the pyramid and the East Platform. This led {{to the destruction of}} the previous version's east face each time a new version was superimposed over the older version.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight was}} {{operated}} {{for the purpose}} <b>of</b> <b>maintaining</b> the currency of the instrument rating {{of two of the}} airline's pilots. Shortly after takeoff and only seconds after climbing through , the plane began banking to the right. It continued to roll through 90degrees; the nose then dropped suddenly and moments later it struck the ground. All three members of the flight crew were killed upon impact.|$|E

5|$|The funding {{produced}} by the Battleship Texas Commission was {{not up to the}} task <b>of</b> <b>maintaining</b> the ship. Consequently, years of neglect resulted in cracks and gaps in coated surfaces, water intrusion, and steel deterioration. Paint in interior spaces began to crack, then flake, exposing metal surfaces underneath, which began to rust. At the same time, pipes open to the sea ultimately failed, flooding various voids and bunkers.|$|E
5|$|The {{payment of}} death duties and the {{difficulty}} <b>of</b> <b>maintaining</b> a large estate during the Second World War forced the Cubitt family to begin selling packets of land. Cubitt's mansion was abandoned until its demolition in 1953, by which time the family {{was living in a}} Regency-style house converted from the housing that had been provided for the garden and stable staff in more affluent times.|$|E
5|$|The {{road that}} {{currently}} carries the SR-202 designation has existed since 1937, when it connected US-40 and US-50 along the Garfield Cut-Off Road. The Utah State Legislature designated the road SR-202 in 1969, thus taking responsibility <b>of</b> <b>maintaining</b> {{the road from}} the county. No changes or alterations have been made to SR-202, except for the legal definition of the road, which has changed twice since it was formed.|$|E
