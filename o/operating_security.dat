40|$|During {{power system}} operations, the system {{operators}} are often struggling with identifying the dynamic <b>operating</b> <b>security</b> modes {{of the system}} in a fast, accurate and reliable manner. The system security constraints are in fact boundaries that surround all possible operating modes (scenarios) of the power system. In other words, these boundaries form the feasible operating domain - in the parameter space spanned by various operating variables - within which the system can safely be operated. For a given operating scenario, the associated security level {{is measured by the}} “distance” (for example, the Euclidean norm) of the operating point from the security region boundary. This paper reports on the results of a recently completed research and development paper, which included the development of innovative computerized schemes, which are capable of identifying dynamic <b>operating</b> <b>security</b> modes during the on-line operation of electric power systems. The methodology adopted in this paper includes the development of advanced, highly efficient computerized algorithms for fast identification of dynamic <b>operating</b> <b>security</b> modes of power systems. One of the salient outcomes of this paper is the development of a novel framework for identification and representation of <b>operating</b> <b>security</b> regions in power systems as well as evaluation of security levels associated with different operating scenarios. While the concepts and principles presented are general, the work of this paper is confined to the interpretation of the security boundary in terms of system stability criteria. Of course, the framework presented is applicable quite as well to other criteria that may be considered...|$|E

40|$|In {{sociology}} {{the understanding}} of the essence of operation security’s concept is inextricably linked with the concepts of «uncertainty», «risk», «challenge», «threat», «danger». The logical ordering of these concepts will allow characterizing the layered structure of the phenomenon of <b>operating</b> <b>security,</b> revealing the specific state of the object of <b>operating</b> <b>security</b> and evaluating the degree of influence of destabilizing factors. Uncertainty should be viewed as trends in the state of an object over time. Uncertainty as such is closely linked with the concept of risk. Reduction of the risk is necessary for minimization of the ignorance and uncertainty. The risk determines the probability of damage to the <b>operating</b> <b>security</b> object, which {{is in a state of}} dynamic equilibrium and is constantly changing. The challenge is a minimal risk, it is distinguished by the presence of the imaginary readiness to prevent the damage of the security object. The threat is characterized by realism, a focus on a high degree of readiness to prevent the damage of the security object. Danger is the combination of factors that can have a negative impact on nature, human society, technological systems. The risk is characterized by the hypothetical absence of the addressee, which is aimed at its impact. The differences between the concepts of «uncertainty», «risk», «challenge», «threat», «danger» have been revealed through the subjective intention and objective capabilities, which characterize objects’ and subjects’ security. The greatest risk is associated with the presence of threats, which are characterized by the presence of two components at one time. A high or medium level of risk is determined by the presence of at least one component. Whereas minimal risk is the absence of a component in a specific point in time, but with the possibility of one of them in future. Analysis of the concepts led to the conclusion that all these concepts are related to one another by the degree of damage to the individual, society and state. The use of these categories will allow ranking the range of possible threats to the security of life and will contribute to the development of adequate, appropriate technologies to combat it, to minimize their negative effects and, consequently, will improve the current system of ensuring safety of personality, society and state...|$|E

In order to study Rotor/Stator interaction phenomenon in axial flow pump, TJ 04 -ZL- 02 hydraulic axial flow pump model is investigated under different operating condition by unsteady simulation based on k-ω turbulence model. Numerical results show that: different flow operating conditions will lead to different Rotor/Stator interaction phenomenon, and also different pressure fluctuation. Fluctuation amplitude in design operating condition is smaller than off design operating condition. So the study proves that pump running in the design operating conditions has important beneficial to the pump operational stability...|$|E
