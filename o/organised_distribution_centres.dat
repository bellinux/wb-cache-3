40|$|The {{location}} of <b>distribution</b> <b>centres</b> for online retailers {{has become an}} important issue for many companies. The operation of the <b>distribution</b> <b>centre</b> for e-commerce seems {{to be different from}} the traditional concept of <b>distribution</b> <b>centres.</b> This study considers how the {{location of}} <b>distribution</b> <b>centres</b> are designed and operated for online retailing using a computer simulation with actual data. This paper analyses current issues in order to propose an effective location for e-commerce <b>distribution</b> <b>centres.</b> An effective location for a multi-distribution system over a wide geographical area is required. This paper clearly points out the importance of locating e-commerce <b>distribution</b> <b>centres</b> over a wide geographical area by performing a computer simulation using actual data on the assumption that online resale business customers live in a metropolitan area. The study created a business model in which a buffer warehouse, which primarily handled commodities with high-frequency shipments, was located near a large consumption area and was used in addition to a large-scale <b>distribution</b> <b>centre.</b> The validity of the created business model was verified by performing a simulation based on actual data. The result revealed that these recommended improvement measures for the location of e-commerce <b>distribution</b> <b>centres</b> can function effectively...|$|R

While the key component of reducing the logistics costs is the distribu-tion centre. The location of <b>distribution</b> <b>centre</b> becomes {{one of the most}} crucial factors that influence the design and manage the logistics system. Regarding the entire supply chain in logistics, the <b>distribution</b> <b>centre</b> takes up vast percentage of the total costs of total logistics operations costs. Indeed, the transportation costs, labour costs and the facilities cost also related to the location of <b>distribution</b> <b>centre.</b> Regarding to this situation, this research is pay-ing attention to the location of <b>distribution</b> <b>centre.</b> Firstly, the main objective of this research is to determine how to getthe appropriate position to be the <b>distribution</b> <b>centre</b> in order to minimize the logistics costs and maximize the value of the whole logistics supply. Meanwhile, develop the whole system of logistics to re-duce the wastes and catch up the customer demand.
