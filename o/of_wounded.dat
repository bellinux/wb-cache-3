We examined whether there is any higher risk <b>of</b> <b>wound</b> infection in patients undergo a reoperation after an initial operation or excision/incision biopsy. Methods and ResultsA retrospective review of medical charts of patients with breast operations between January 1990 and July 2008 was carried out. The overall incidence <b>of</b> <b>wound</b> infection was 18. 2 % (231 / 1267). The rate <b>of</b> <b>wound</b> infection was (32 %) when reoperation was done after previous modified radical mastectomy, 18. 9 % and 16. 8 % when the previous operations were lumpectomy/segmenectomy with axillary dissection and simple mastectomy without axillary dissection, respectively and (10. 8 %) when reoperation was performed after previous biopsy. Reoperation involving axillary dissection was associated with significantly higher rates <b>of</b> <b>wound</b> infection (p< 0. 01).

40|$|AbstractÐSeveral {{wound healing}} rate {{measures}} have been introduced with the main goal of enabling quanti®cation {{of the effects of}} various therapeutic modalities on the healing <b>of</b> open <b>wounds.</b> Different de®nitions <b>of</b> <b>wound</b> healing rate render comparison of clinical results dif®cult. The goal {{of the present study was}} to propose a measure <b>of</b> <b>wound</b> healing rate that is independent <b>of</b> initial <b>wound</b> extent and to present a method <b>of</b> <b>wound</b> healing rate prediction. Comparisons were made <b>of</b> <b>wound</b> healing rate de®ned as absolute area healed per day, percentage of initial area healed per day and advance <b>of</b> the <b>wound</b> margin towards the wound centre per day. Analysis was performed on 300 wound cases. A disadvantage <b>of</b> <b>wound</b> healing measures that either use absolute area healed per day or percentage of initial area healed per day is their very limited use for comparing healing rates <b>of</b> <b>wounds</b> with different initial sizes. This disadvantage was overcome by incorporating a wound perimeter; thus obtaining a measure of the advance <b>of</b> the <b>wound</b> margin towards the wound centre. A de®nition of healing rate expressed as the greatest average wound margin distance from the wound centre divided by the time to complete wound closure is proposed. Because not all wounds are closed in the observation period, the time to complete wound closure has to be predicted. A method <b>of</b> <b>wound</b> healing rate prediction is presented based on a delayed exponential model the parameters of which are obtained from at least ®ve weekly wound area measurements.
