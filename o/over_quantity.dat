500|$|Aoife Wilson of Eurogamer was {{critical}} of Batgirl's characterization, calling it a [...] "bland, no-frills reading of the character, to be frank, which focuses on her familial connections rather than her youthful exuberance." [...] Wilson also lamented that the emphasis on Batgirl's hacking abilities proved {{to be no more}} than a simple extension of Arkham Knights remote hacking environmental puzzles. She offered words similar to Stapleton's on how the lack of additional challenge maps confines the Batgirl character model to only the DLC. Wilson was skeptical as to whether the future season pass DLC would be worth purchasing unless there was an increase in production value and a real introduction to new gadgets and gameplay variety. Carter gave the DLC a 6.5 out of 10, reacting positively to the confinement to the [...] "good bits" [...] of Arkham Knight, more specifically the lack of the Batmobile and an emphasis on puzzle-solving - he also compared it favorably to the Harley Quinn and Red Hood story packs towards which he previously gave negative reviews. In contrast to Stapleton, Carter felt that not many of the environments were particularly memorable, and also felt the length was sufficient compared to the game's previous story packs. Carter pointed out that a benefit to the game would be a free-roaming option involving the downloadable characters. Meanwhile, Erik Kain of Forbes felt that the DLC should have been provided free of charge, remarking on the campaign's shortness and calling it [...] "straightforward" [...] and [...] "lackluster". He also criticized Warner Bros. for their marketing campaign with Arkham Knight and its DLC, commenting on their sacrificing quality <b>over</b> <b>quantity</b> to continuously charge customers for rather mediocre content.|$|E

Ruggierie praised Beyoncé's performance, particularly the strong vocals demonstrated in [...] "1+1" [...] and concluded [...] "watching her command a stadium stage for two hours was another reminder of her limitless ambition". However, {{it was noted that}} Beyoncé did not speak to the crowd very often. After Beyoncé's hometown performance in Houston, Brandon Caldwell of the Houston Press introduced his article stating [...] "Hours after the slaying, the wig snatching, the fitted snatching, the life getting, the boy byes and various curses of shock, amazement and confusion, I stood with a perplexed look on my face. How? How does Beyoncé do this? On this level? With this magnitude?". Lorraine Ali of the Los Angeles Times concluded her positive review of the Pasadena stop of the tour with [...] "Soaking wet and sitting onstage alone, she left the audience with the closing number, [...] "Halo". She'd been baptized and reborn into a less-perfect version of Queen Bey, allowing a more powerful Beyoncé to arise from that imperfection". Jim Harrington of the San Jose Mercury News began his article stating [...] "there were so many moving parts – a tremendous swirl of sharply choreographed dance routines, cool special effects, brilliant fireworks and other tactics for delighting tens of thousands", Harrington noted however that too many snippets of songs rather than their full versions were performed, feeling quality <b>over</b> <b>quantity</b> was missed. The first Canadian show of the tour in Edmonton was performed in cold and rainy conditions, with Beyoncé stating [...] "Can you feel your fingers? I can't feel mine" [...] and [...] "I have to say this is the coldest show I've ever done". Despite this, Sandra Sperounes of the Edmonton Journal commented [...] "not even rain or bitter wind could stop our Ms. Flawless, our Survivor, our Queen Bey from dazzling an estimated 40,000 fans at Commonwealth Stadium on a stormy Friday night." [...] Sperounes concluded [...] "the sun was nowhere to be found, but thanks to Bey's brilliant set, the crowd left beaming with giddiness, girl power and generosity".|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} a multiple-stage game in which, at {{the final}} stage, two (managerial) firms compete <b>over</b> <b>quantities</b> in the product market. Prior to this stage, firm-specific unions set the workers' wages, while the owners of both firms hire managers and provide them with incentive contracts.

The possibility of multiple equilibria arises, where both owners choose managerial contracts before or after unions' wage setting, crucially depending on unions' preferences. Such results also prove to be true for a remarkable degree of asymmetry in preferences over wages vis-Ã -vis employment across unions...|$|R
40|$|In default of the theorem of "detailed balance": Pi;=P;i, {{with regard}} to {{elementary}} transition probabilities, several "balance" theorems are introduced and proved {{on the basis of}} symmetry of physical laws in space-time. (1) First theorem of "averaged balance" (Sec. 5) : We can establish P;;=P;; by averaging <b>over</b> <b>quantities</b> of "minus class. " Table V (Sec. 3) gives a list of "minus" quantities. (2) The so-called "detailed balance of col­lisions" in classical physics is a special case of Theorem I. (3) Heitler-Coester's theorem of "semidetailed balance" is also a special case of Theorem I. (4) Second theorem of "averaged balance" (Sec. 5) : We can establish Pi;=P;; by averaging <b>over</b> <b>quantities</b> with PR= - 1. The quantities with PR= - 1 are listed in Table II (Sec. 2). (5) Theorem of "cyclic balance" (Sec. 7) : In classical physics, a chain of transitions i [...] >j [...] >k [...] >· ·· [...] >i repeats itself cyclically. (6) Theorem of "long-range balance" (Sec. 7) : The time average of transition probability from i to j is equal to the time average of transition probability from j to i. Theorems I, II, and III, are direct consequences of inversibility (covariance for space-and-time inversion). Theorem IV is a consequence of reversibility (covariance for time reversal). Theorems V and VI are connected with ergodicity of Markoff's chains. This ergodicity is proved by the condition of bilateral normalization of transition probabilities: l:; P;;= 1, l:; Pi;= 1. This bilateral normalization in turn can be derived from either reversibility or inversibility. The limits of validity of all these balance theorems in actual applications are carefully examined in the text...|$|R
