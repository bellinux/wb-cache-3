500|$|Pat Toomay, the Buffalo Bills’ {{defensive}} line MVP and former Dallas Cowboy, who he believed {{was placed on}} the expansion list as a form of blackballing due to the publication of his novel The Crunch, noting in a 2014 Sports Illustrated article that the novel [...] "was the kind <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> write AFTER you retire, not while you're still playing".|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} 2014 CGI special's release, a comic which was {{published}} by IDW Publishing was withdrawn after retailers complained {{that they wanted to}} boycott the issue. The comic, which shows the Powerpuff Girls with breasts and dressed in latex, was designed by an artist who works for Cartoon Network. The artist was [...] "thinking of it more along the lines of 'female empowerment' than the kind <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> guys are talking about". Cartoon Network said in a statement: [...] "We recognise some fans' reaction to the cover and, as such, will no longer be releasing it at comic book shops." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} {{towards the}} video was mostly positive. Adam Fairholm from the Internet Music Video Database praised Shakira's dance moves and {{flexibility in the}} video and complimented Nava's direction. James Montgomery from MTV also commended Shakira's dancing, noting that she [...] "even manages to out-Beyoncé". He also complimented Shakira's body, commenting that her posterior is the [...] "breakout star of the video". Anna Pickard from The Guardian appreciated the originality of the video and noted that [...] "the moves contained in this video are not the kind <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> see every day". Andrew Bast from The Daily Beast, however, gave the video a negative review and criticized it for being overly sexual.|$|E

500|$|Immediately after (Turn On) The Music Machine was released, {{the band}} left for another U.S. tour, despite pleas {{by the group}} to arrange an {{appearance}} at the Monterey Pop Festival. In the small off-periods in their hard-pressed schedule, the Music Machine demoed a new batch of Bonniwell originals at RCA Studios in New York City and Cosimo Matassa's facility in New Orleans, before polishing the tunes back in Los Angeles. From the sessions emerged the group's third single [...] "Double Yellow Line", which was released in April 1967, and bubbled under the Billboard Hot 100 at number 111. The subsequent release, [...] "Eagle Never Hunts the Fly" [...] failed to chart, but {{is often described as}} Bonniwell's tour de force—a tune Ross praised as [...] "sonically compelling works and a lot to listen to, for the time. It was the kind <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> just didn’t hear, you almost worried about getting those sounds onto a 45".|$|E
500|$|Quatermass 2 {{received}} mixed reviews. Campbell Dixon in The Daily Telegraph {{found the}} film “all good grisly fun, {{if this is}} the sort <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> enjoy”. The reviewer in The Times remarked that “the writer of the original story, Mr Nigel Kneale, and the director, Mr Val Guest, between them keep things moving at the right speed, without digressions. The film has an air of respect for the issues touched on, and this impression is confirmed by the acting generally”. On the other hand, Jympson Harman of the London Evening News wrote: “Science-fiction hokum can be convincing, exciting or just plain laughable. Quatermass II [...] fails on all these scores, I am afraid”. Similarly, the reviewer in the Daily Herald felt “The whole thing is daft and full of stilted dialogue. [...] At the end a detective says: “How am I going to make a report on all this?” I felt the same way”.|$|E
500|$|Cameron Adams from News.com.au wrote: [...] " [...] poured {{much of her}} sadness {{into her}} {{intimate}} two-hour Tears of a Clown show, peppering emotional renditions of her hits with cheeky jokes and banter." [...] In another article reviewing the show, Adams noted that Tears of a Clown was [...] "the sort <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> never thought you'd see a superstar do". He complimented Madonna's jokes, chatting about her life in-between songs, for being [...] "raw and vulnerable" [...] and confessed that it was [...] "fascinating— and difficult— to watch. We're not used to Madonna on stage doing {{anything less than a}} fully rehearsed, slick stage show." [...] Concluding the review, Adams believed that Tears of a Clown professed Madonna's touring direction into the future. Writing for The Independent Nick Levine noticed that the singer [...] "tested out her stand-up comedy skills with a series of risqué jokes and took the opportunity to defend her controversial fashion sense." [...] Debbie Cuthbertson from The Sydney Morning Herald gave a positive review of the show, saying [...] "For the queen of self-control, it was an open, at times even vulnerable insight into her persona. She seemed relaxed, drinking Cosmopolitans as she spoke at length between songs." [...] Cuthbertson also commended the choice of Forum Theatre as a venue believing it to be [...] "inspired, and her crew lit up the grand old dame in a way that showcased all her delicate charms in a way I can't recall any other act having ever done." ...|$|E

The Lady Of The Lake appears and tells Arthur {{that he and the}} Knights have been in a Broadway musical all along. Patsy also reveals he is half Jewish, but didn't want to say {{anything}} to Arthur because [...] "that's not really the sort <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> say to a heavily armed Christian." [...] All that's left is for King Arthur to find the Grail and marry someone. After picking up on some not-too-subtle hints, Arthur decides to marry the Lady Of The Lake after he finds the Grail ("Twice in Every Show").|$|E
