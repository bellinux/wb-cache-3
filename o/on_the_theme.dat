5|$|In May 1843, Etty was one {{of eight}} artists chosen by Prince Albert to paint frescoes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> of Milton's Comus for a new {{pavilion}} being built in the grounds of Buckingham Palace. Etty was unhappy with his selection, as fresco was a medium with which he had no experience, but reluctantly did so, choosing to paint <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> of Circe and the Sirens Three. The result was a disaster. Etty found himself unable to retouch or alter his existing work, as any freshly applied paint would flake away from the existing paint layer, and the lunette shape of the panel left Etty with a large empty space above the central figures. Etty's fresco was deemed unsalvageable, and although he offered to paint a replacement <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> of Hesperus he was rejected, and William Dyce was commissioned to paint a replacement fresco. Etty was paid only a token £40 fee.|$|E

5|$|Another {{variation}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> {{was produced}} {{later in the}} season. Like the BT46B, the BT46C removed the radiators from the front wing assembly leaving a clean aerodynamic wing and moving the centre of gravity further back again. The standard radiators were replaced by units from a Volkswagen Golf mounted behind the front wheels out of the airstream in a region of positive pressure.|$|E
5|$|Chinmoy (1931–2007) {{joined the}} ashram in 1944. Later, {{he wrote the}} play about Sri Aurobindo's life – Sri Aurobindo: Descent of the Blue – and a book, Infinite: Sri Aurobindo. An author, composer, artist and athlete, he was {{perhaps best known for}} holding public events <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> of inner peace and world harmony (such as concerts, meditations, and races).|$|E
5|$|In 2011 David Pountney was {{appointed}} to succeed Fisher as chief executive. He had worked with the company since the 1970s, most recently on a 2006 The Flying Dutchman with Terfel which was set in space. In 2013 he programmed a trilogy of operas set in Tudor England: Donizetti's Anna Bolena, Maria Stuarda and Roberto Devereux, with another trilogy the following year, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> of fallen women – Puccini's Manon Lescaut, Henze's Boulevard Solitude and Verdi's La traviata. For 2016 Pountney scheduled another trilogy, this time <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> of Figaro, consisting of Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro and Rossini's The Barber of Seville and a new work, Figaro Gets a Divorce with music by Elena Langer and libretto by Pountney.|$|E

5|$|The Fifth Symphony has a non-customary structure, {{comprising}} two movements {{instead of}} the common three or four.

5|$|A {{preoccupation with}} his own {{mortality}} permeates Shostakovich's later works, among them the later quartets and the Fourteenth Symphony of 1969 (a song cycle based {{on a number of}} poems <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> of death). This piece also finds Shostakovich at his most extreme with musical language, with twelve-tone themes and dense polyphony used throughout. Shostakovich dedicated this score to his close friend Benjamin Britten, who conducted its Western premiere at the 1970 Aldeburgh Festival. The Fifteenth Symphony of 1971 is, by contrast, melodic and retrospective in nature, quoting Wagner, Rossini and the composer's own Fourth Symphony.|$|E
5|$|Academic {{journals}} and conferences, however, {{have continued to}} comment <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> of race within the game. In 2011, Andre Brock from Games and Culture said that the game drew from well-established racial and gender stereotypes, saying that the African people were only ever depicted as savage, even before transitioning into zombies. Writing for the Digital Games Research Association in 2011, Geyser and Tshabalala noted that racial stereotyping {{had never been in}} intention of Capcom, though compared their depiction of Africa to that of the 1899 novel Heart of Darkness. Post-colonial Africa, they opined, was portrayed as being unable to take care of itself, and at the mercy of Western influences.|$|E

5|$|After {{the success}} of Trial by Jury, Gilbert and Sullivan were {{suddenly}} in demand to write more operas together. Over the next two years, Richard D'Oyly Carte and Carl Rosa were two of several theatrical managers who negotiated with the team but were unable to come to terms. Carte proposed a revival of Thespis for the 1875 Christmas season, which Gilbert and Sullivan would have revised, but {{he was unable to}} obtain financing for the project. In early 1876, Carte requested that Gilbert and Sullivan create another one-act opera <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> of burglars, but this was never completed.|$|E
5|$|In 1888 Cecil Rhodes paid a {{visit to}} Victoria College. As the leader of the College debating society, Smuts was called upon to deliver the {{welcoming}} address on behalf of the student body.

5|$|In 2010, Palmer was {{appointed}} {{professor in the}} Department of Philosophy at Texas A University.

Wilson in Ethics and Daniel A. Dombrowski in the Journal of Animal Ethics.

The image horrified Hall; her guilt at being depicted in a drawing that she saw as blasphemous led to her choice of a religious subject for her next novel, The Master of the House.|$|E
5|$|Jay Wolpert {{developed}} a script based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> park ride in 2001, and Stuart Beattie rewrote it in early 2002. Around that time, producer Jerry Bruckheimer {{became involved in}} the project; he had Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio work on the script, adding the supernatural curse to the storyline. Filming took place from October 2002 to March 2003 in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and on sets constructed around Los Angeles, California. It was also significant in being the first film released under the Walt Disney Pictures banner to be rated PG-13 by the MPAA.|$|E

5|$|Seabirds {{evolved to}} exploit {{different}} food {{resources in the}} world's seas and oceans, and to a great extent, their physiology and behaviour have been shaped by their diet. These evolutionary forces have often caused species in different families and even orders to evolve similar strategies and adaptations to the same problems, leading to remarkable convergent evolution, such as that between auks and penguins. There are four basic feeding strategies, or ecological guilds, for feeding at sea: surface feeding, pursuit diving, plunge diving and predation of higher vertebrates; within these guilds there are multiple variations <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme.</b>|$|E
5|$|Writing in {{the book}} The Films of Luc Besson, Susan Hayward, {{director}} of Film Studies at the University of Exeter, considered Le Dernier Combat and The Fifth Element to be Besson's two film's which focus <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> of environmental damage, as waste and pollution are visible throughout both films. Capitalism was also {{considered to be a}} theme; consumer commodities were said to be signs of death, such as the abandoned cars in the desert and the floating washing machines in a flooded abandoned factory.|$|E
