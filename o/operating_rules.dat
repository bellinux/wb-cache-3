5|$|The 1996 Maryland train {{collision}} {{occurred on}} February 16, 1996, when a MARC commuter train collided with Amtrak's Capitol Limited passenger train in Silver Spring, Maryland. An {{investigation by the}} National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found that {{the crew of the}} MARC train had forgotten the indication of an approach signal which they had passed before a station stop, and as a consequence could not slow down in time after encountering a stop signal. The collision killed three crew and eight passengers on the MARC train; a further eleven passengers on the MARC train and fifteen passengers and crew on the Capitol Limited were injured. Total damage was estimated at $7.5 million. The crash {{led to the creation of}} comprehensive federal rules for passenger car design, the first in the history of passenger service in the United States, as well as changes to <b>operating</b> <b>rules.</b>|$|E

40|$|Genetic algorithms, founded {{upon the}} {{principle}} of evolution, are applicable to many optimization problems, especially popular for solving parameter optimization problems. Reservoir <b>operating</b> <b>rule</b> curves {{are the most common}} way for guiding and managing the reservoir operation. These rule curves traditionally are derived through intensive simulation techniques. The main aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the efficiency and effectiveness of two genetic algorithms (GAs), i. e., binary coded and real coded, to derive multipurpose reservoir <b>operating</b> <b>rule</b> curves. The curves are assumed to be piecewise linear functions where the coordinates of their inflection points are the unknowns and we want to optimize system performance. The applicability and effectiveness of the proposed methods are tested on the operation of the Shih-Men reservoir in Taiwan. The current M- 5 operating curves of the Shih-Men reservoir are also evaluated. The results show that the GAs provide an adequate, effective and robust way for searching the rule curves. Both sets of <b>operating</b> <b>rule</b> curves obtained from GAs have better performance, in terms of water release deficit and hydropower, than the current M- 5 <b>operating</b> <b>rule</b> curves, while the real-coded GA is more efficient than the binary-coded GA.

40|$|SummaryOperating rule curves {{have been}} widely applied to {{reservoir}} operation, due to their ease of implementation. However, these curves excluding ecological requirement are generally derived from observed or synthetic flows and have rarely been determined by future flows under climate change. This paper develops an integrated adaptive optimization model (IAOM) for derivation of multipurpose reservoir <b>operating</b> <b>rule</b> curves including ecological <b>operating</b> <b>rule</b> curve under future climate change. Steps in the proposed IAOM include: (1) weather generator module to generate feasible future climate conditions, (2) VIC model as the hydrological simulation module to generate streamflows from those future weather conditions, and (3) multipurpose reservoir optimization module to determine the optimal reservoir operations to deal with climate change. China’s Danjiangkou reservoir in Han River basin is selected for a case study. The results demonstrate that the IAOM provides optimal multipurpose reservoir <b>operating</b> <b>rule</b> curves that reflect the hydrologic characteristics of future climate change. Ecological supply water operation will alleviate negative effect of dam on river ecosystem without reducing conservation benefits and flood control standard. Therefore, they can consult with reservoir administrators if it is useful results for operations...|$|R

However, combat losses during these reconnaissance missions heightened Lavelle's concern about the <b>operating</b> <b>rules</b> and the effect on his crews.

25|$|The <b>operating</b> <b>rules</b> for trains with {{a single}} {{engineer}} is that all signals are to be reported to the conductor. This allows the conductor to 'pull the air' (apply the emergency brakes) should the engineer appear to be incapacitated for any reason. However, in this incident, {{according to the data}} video, the last two signals were not reported, nor did the conductor apply the brakes.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory and}} {{application}} of these protective devices {{is an important part}} of the education of a power engineer who specializes in power system protection. The need to act quickly to protect circuits and equipment as well as the general public often requires protective relays to respond and trip a breaker within a few thousandths of a second. In some instances these clearance times are prescribed in legislation or <b>operating</b> <b>rules.</b> A maintenance or testing program is used to determine the performance and availability of protection systems.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Operating</b> <b>Rule</b> Program was {{developed}} in an earlier study to furnish a means to determine optimum desalting plant size, optimal <b>operating</b> <b>rule,</b> and costs of operating in conjunction with existing water supply systems, under the present study, five further objectives were accomplished: (1) The program was applied to a New York City water supply system feasibility study {{in connection with a}} dual purpose nuclear power plant to develop costs for adding firm yield to the New York City water supply system in conjunctive operation with the desalting plant. (2) The program was modified to enable assessment of stage construction of desalting units when used in conjunction with a natural water supply system on the basis of both constant costs over the period of analysis and inflationary costs. Techniques were developed for applying the program to determine the optimal plant module size, timing of units, and cost of the water. (3) A separate, smaller program {{was developed}} to enable analysis of desalting plant operation in conjunction with a natural water supply system having no storage capacity. (4) A training program provided instruction to a selected group designated by OSW on the detailed use and application of the Modified <b>Operating</b> <b>Rule</b> Program.

50|$|Rule 55 was an <b>operating</b> <b>rule</b> which applied on British {{railways}} in the 19th and 20th centuries, {{and which}} was superseded by the Modular Rulebook following re-privatisation of the railways.

25|$|Trains {{can travel}} {{at very high}} speed, but they are heavy, are unable to deviate from the track and require a great {{distance}} to stop. Possible accidents include derailment (jumping the track), a collision with another train or collision with automobiles, other vehicles or pedestrians at level crossings. The last accounts {{for the majority of}} rail accidents and casualties. The most important safety measures to prevent accidents are strict <b>operating</b> <b>rules,</b> e.g. railway signalling and gates or grade separation at crossings. Train whistles, bells or horns warn of the presence of a train, while trackside signals maintain the distances between trains.|$|E
25|$|The {{signalling}} {{process is}} traditionally {{carried out in}} a signal box, a small building that houses the lever frame required for the signalman to operate switches and signal equipment. These are placed at various intervals along the route of a railway, controlling specified sections of track. More recent technological developments have made such operational doctrine superfluous, with the centralization of signalling operations to regional control rooms. This has been facilitated by {{the increased use of}} computers, allowing vast sections of track to be monitored from a single location. The common method of block signalling divides the track into zones guarded by combinations of block signals, <b>operating</b> <b>rules,</b> and automatic-control devices so that only one train may be in a block at any time.|$|E

2500|$|In older locomotives, the {{throttle}} mechanism was ratcheted {{so that it}} was not possible to advance more than one power position at a time. The engine driver could not, for example, pull {{the throttle}} from notch 2 to notch 4 without stopping at notch 3. This feature was intended to prevent rough train handling due to abrupt power increases caused by rapid throttle motion ("throttle stripping," [...] an <b>operating</b> <b>rules</b> violation on many railroads). [...] Modern locomotives no longer have this restriction, as their control systems are able to smoothly modulate power and avoid sudden changes in train loading regardless of how the engine driver operates the controls.|$|E

2500|$|Since Conrail {{acquired}} many separate railways, and the North American railway {{signalling system}} is not standardized, operators needed to qualify on {{as many as seven}} different signalling systems. The varying systems include, but are not limited to, the PRR position light signals, the NYC searchlight signals and tri-light signals, and the EL tri-light signals. The NYC tri-light was adopted as Conrail's systemwide standard for new signal installations. Most of the existing technologies were defined by the Northeast <b>Operating</b> <b>Rules</b> Advisory Committee (NORAC). Conrail had its own, unique tri-light signal modernization program that was applied to many routes. Today, most Northeastern railroads associated with former Conrail assets are working towards standardization of all systems as vertical color light signals.

2500|$|Soon {{after the}} advent of the automobile, speeds were {{increasing}} and the popularity of enclosed cars made the concept of [...] "stop, look, and listen" [...] at railroad crossings difficult. Fatalities at crossings were increasing. Though the idea of automatic grade crossing protection was not new, no one had invented a fail-safe, universally recognized system. In those days, many crossings were protected by a watchman who warned of an oncoming train by swinging a red lantern in a side-to-side arc, used universally in the U.S. to signify [...] "stop". This motion is still used today by railroad workers to indicate stop per the General Code of <b>Operating</b> <b>Rules</b> (GCOR) Rule 5.3.1. It was presumed that a mechanical device that mimicked that movement would catch the eye of approaching motorists and give an unmistakable warning.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{possible}} exception to that general {{rule on the}} Canadian side was CKLW in Windsor, Ontario, {{across the river from}} Detroit. Originally licensed as a Class II-B (now Class B) station and always operating in full compliance with the technical specifications and <b>operating</b> <b>rules</b> of its CRTC licence (i.e., protection of the entire Mexican border nights and protection of co-channel Canadian stations days and nights), CKLW's 50,000-watt directional signal blanketed much of Michigan and northern Ohio east to Cleveland days and nights, and south to Toledo, Lima and Dayton in the daytime. [...] American-owned until 1970 as part of the RKO General chain (along with such other top 40 powerhouses as KHJ in Los Angeles and KFRC in San Francisco), it functioned essentially as a Detroit-market station during the 1960s and 1970s. Its Motown-flavored personality Top 40 format made {{it one of the most}} highly rated stations in the Midwestern US. The decline of AM radio as a music source in the 1970s, combined with new Canadian government rules imposing minimum domestic music content, made it difficult for CKLW to continue to compete for listeners with Detroit-based, US-licensed FM music stations, which offered clean stereo sound and faced no program content or music playlist restrictions. CKLW abandoned the Top 40 format and its efforts to compete in the Detroit market in the 1980s. Today it is a news/talk station aimed specifically at an Ontario audience, though still containing a significant amount of American syndicated talk.|$|E
2500|$|Section 112 of the Canadian Rail <b>Operating</b> <b>Rules</b> states [...] "when {{equipment}} is left {{at any point}} {{a sufficient number of}} hand brakes must be applied to prevent it from moving" [...] and [...] "the effectiveness of the hand brakes must be tested” before relying on their retarding force. The engineer tests the hand brakes by seeing if the train budges when trying to push and pull the train with locomotive power. If a train is left on an incline, the number of handbrakes needed to hold the train increases. It takes 2–3 minutes per car to set the hand brakes. The track from Nantes to Lac-Mégantic is downhill on a 1.2% grade. Nantes is [...] above sea level, Lac Mégantic is [...] lower at [...] The MMA claimed that its braking policy required the activation of hand brakes on the five locomotives and 11 freight cars, or 20.5% of the total train. However, the TSB confirmed evidence in the criminal charges citing MMA procedures requiring nine brakes to hold a 70–79 car train. The TSB concluded that a minimum of 17 and possibly as many as 26 hand brakes would have been needed to secure the train, depending on the amount of force with which they had been applied. Transport Canada does not validate the special instructions of a railway company or give any specific guidance on how many brakes must be applied for parked freight trains. While Transport Canada had repeatedly reprimanded MMA from 2004 to 2009 and in 2011 and 2012 for violations of CROR Section 112 handbrake requirements on parked trains in Nantes, no fines had been issued for the infractions.|$|E

50|$|Within the United States, each {{railroad}} operator formulates its own operating practices, {{subject to}} the regulations in Title 49 Part 236 of the Code of Federal Regulations).

Major railroads on the East Coast have adopted the NORAC rules. Most railroads west of the Mississippi River, as well as the U.S. operations of the Canadian Pacific Railway, use the GCOR.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new and}} heuristic approach for improving the performance of multipurpose reservoirs already in operation. The main characteristic of the method is that the analyst must first learn from the past experience of the manager and synthesize it into a very simple <b>operating</b> <b>rule.</b> Then, the analyst must point out {{with the help of}} the manager what the acceptable modifications of such a rule are. Only after these phases have been carried out can possible improvements in the management be obtained by using standard optimization techniques. The method has been applied to the case of Lake Como, (Northern Italy), and the results are quite satisfactory since the major objectives of the management can be substantially improved. The average duration of the floods on the lake shores and the mean volume of the water deficits in the downstream agricultural areas are about halved, without lowering the mean yearly electricity production of the downstream run-of-river plants. Moreover, the advantages of a revision of the active storage and of a possible protection of the shores of the town of Como are also investigated. All the results of this study had a direct impact on the management of the lake. In fact, the proposed <b>operating</b> <b>rule</b> has been programmed on a microcomputer, which is now used every day by the manager as an essential support for his final decision; the active storage was lowered in June 1982 by the Ministry of Public Works, and the sunken part of Como town will be soon repaved and elevated by the Municipality...|$|R
