5|$|The {{construction}} works were complex, and many contractors {{were involved in}} delivering them. The CTRL Section 2 {{construction works}} had caused considerable disruption around the Kings Cross area of London; in their wake redevelopment was stimulated. The large redevelopment area includes the run-down areas of post-industrial and ex-railway land close to King's Cross and St Pancras, a conservation area with many listed buildings; this was promoted as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> for building the CTRL. It has been postulated that this development was actually suppressed by the construction project, and some affected districts were said still {{to be in a}} poor state in 2005.|$|E
25|$|The leader, being {{equidistant}} {{from all}} sections, in principle hears the best sound. The often intense sonic experience of {{standing in the}} center of the square is considered <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> of leading, and sometimes a guest will be invited as a courtesy to stand next to the leader during a song.|$|E
25|$|The {{need for}} grid storage to provide peak power {{is reduced by}} demand side time of use pricing, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> of smart meters. At the {{household}} level, consumers may choose less expensive off-peak times for clothes washer/dryers, dishwashers, showers and cooking.

25|$|There {{are many}} {{benefits}} to spending time alone. Freedom {{is considered to}} be <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> of solitude; the constraints of others will not have any effect on a person who is spending time in solitude, therefore giving the person more latitude in their actions. With increased freedom, a person’s choices {{are less likely to be}} affected by exchanges with others.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> of {{mechanical}} harvesting is {{the relatively low}} cost. A harvester is able to run 24 {{hours a day and}} pick 80-200 tons of grapes, compared to the 1-2 tons that an experienced human picker could harvest. In hot climates, where picking quickly or in the cool of night is a priority, mechanical harvesting can accomplish these goals very well.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> being {{a member}} of the school's JTC and Combined Cadet Force was that Derby School pupils were allowed to {{undertake}} Cert.'A' training in all military matters and in Derby this meant that final exams were held at The Barracks at Sinfin in Derby, the home of the Sherwood Foresters Regiment. Passing out with a Cert.'A' meant that when the boys were later called up to undertake their National Service they were one step ahead of the majority of young men.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> side <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{railroad}} extension was {{a building}} boom <b>of</b> mansions in <b>the</b> newly accessible village of East Hampton {{resulting in the}} wealthy venturing further east from Southampton with the Maidstone Golf Club opening 1891.|$|R

25|$|In July 1949, {{approval}} {{was given}} to convert one Grant to the self-propelled configuration and the prototype subsequently underwent user and firing trials at Puckapunyal in December 1949. It was {{then returned to the}} factory for modifications and completion of the stowage arrangements. Following general acceptance by the Army, authorisation was given in February 1950 to convert another 13 Grants to Yerambas. The first of these conversions was completed in November 1950 and the last was delivered in August 1952. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> of the conversion was standardisation, as the Grant tank was still used by the 2nd Armoured Brigade itself, whilst the 25pounder field gun was also the standard field artillery equipment in service. It was also the cheapest available solution.|$|E
25|$|Hackett {{lobbied for}} the {{creation}} of an African-American community hospital but was unsuccessful. In 1921, Hackett purchased the residence of former Territorial Governor Joseph Kibbey which was located next door to his house at 1342 E. Jefferson St.. In 1922, he established the Booker T. Washington Memorial Hospital a private medical in that residence. The hospital didn't have many beds at first and each bed was situated in the screened porch of the house. Hackett purchased three adjoining lots and was, therefore, able to expand the hospital. He also had six cottages built for tuberculosis patients. He charged his patients $12.50 to $35.00 per week for a hospital stay. Hackett opened a pharmacy nearby and recruited Southern African-American nurses with college nursing degrees to join his staff. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> which the African-American doctors and nurses gained from joining him was the opportunity to gain valuable experience in their chosen field.|$|E
25|$|After serving {{five years}} in the Maryland General Assembly, Anderson was elected {{chairman}} of the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland. As chairman he sponsored and saw passed Maryland's Minority Business Enterprise Act. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> of this act for minority business was increased participation in major state projects like the building of Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Nearly 20% of the contracts let for the construction of the new ballpark went to minority owned businesses. After 12 years in the House, Anderson ran for the Senate in 1994 but was defeated in the Democratic primary. He practiced law for the next 8 years. In 2002, he made a run for the House of Delegates. As before he was a non-incumbent running against four incumbents for three seats. Unlike his first race in 1982 where he beat all the incumbents and finished first, this time Anderson finished third with a razor-thin 100-vote margin of victory over 4th-place finisher incumbent Ken Montague. In the 2006 general election campaign, Anderson joined with 43rd district incumbents Senator Joan Carter Conway, and Delegates Maggie McIntosh and Ann Marie Doory to defeat a field of 6 other challengers.|$|E

2500|$|An MMU also {{mitigates}} {{the problem}} of fragmentation of memory. [...] After blocks of memory have been allocated and freed, the free memory may become fragmented (discontinuous) so that the largest contiguous block of free memory may be {{much smaller than the}} total amount. [...] With virtual memory, a contiguous range of virtual addresses can be mapped to several non-contiguous blocks of physical memory; this non-contiguous allocation is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> of paging.|$|E

According to the first which may be called the big economy assumption, the European economy not being poisoned by structural desequilibria - the huge private sector deficit (about 5 % of GDP) which characterises the American economy {{as a consequence of}} past overinvestment - should soon rebound {{in such a way that}} the prospect for 2002, and in a greater extent for 2003, will be rather bright. After all, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> rightly expected from <b>the</b> creation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> euro is that it transforms a collection of small and medium sized economies into one big economy arithmetically less open to trade and enjoying thus a greater degree of autonomy ( [...] .) ...|$|R

2500|$|HIV infects a cell through fusion {{with the}} cell membrane, which {{requires}} two different cellular molecular participants, CD4 and a chemokine receptor (differing {{depending on the}} cell type). [...] Approaches to blocking this virus/cell fusion have shown some promise in preventing entry of the virus into a cell. [...] At least one of theses entry inhibitors—a biomimetic peptide marketed under the brand name Fuzeon—has received FDA approval {{and has been in}} use for some time. [...] Potentially, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> from the use of an effective entry-blocking or entry-inhibiting agent is that it potentially may not only prevent the spread of the virus within an infected individual but also the spread from an infected to an uninfected individual.|$|E

2500|$|These criticisms {{continued}} through the 1990s under the Clinton administration, who furthered the anti-regulatory environment through his Executive Order 12866. EO 12866 changed some of Reagan's language, requiring benefits to justify, rather than exceed costs, and added [...] "reduction of discrimination or bias" [...] as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> to be analyzed. Criticisms of aspects of CBA, including uncertainly valuations, discounting future values, and the calculation of risk, were used to argue that CBA should play no part in the regulatory process. The use of CBA in the regulatory process continues today under the Obama administration, though the debate over its practical and objective value continues. Some analysts oppose the use of CBA in policy making, while those in favor of its use favor improvements to the analysis and calculations.|$|E

2500|$|Vine {{training}} {{systems can}} be broadly classified {{by a number of}} different measurements. One of the oldest means was based on the relative height of the trunk with the distance of the canopy from the ground being described as high-trained (also known as [...] "high culture" [...] or vignes hautes) or low-trained (vignes basses). The ancient Romans were adherents of the high-trained vine systems with the tendone system of vines trained high over head along a pergola being one example. In the 1950s, Austrian winemaker Lenz Moser advocated the high-culture style of training, recommending low density plantings of vines with trunks 4ft (1.25 m) high. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> of a high-trained system is better frost protection versus low-trained systems such as the gobelet training system which tend to hang low to the ground. Some training systems such as the Guyot and cordons can be adapted to both high and low trained styles.|$|E
