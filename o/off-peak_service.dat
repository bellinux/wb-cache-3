5|$|On this line, {{the station}} is on the Bank or City branch; the next {{stations}} are Borough {{to the north and}} Kennington to the south. The typical <b>off-peak</b> <b>service</b> (as of January 2015) in trains per hour (tph) is 10tph northbound to each of High Barnet and Edgware and 20tph southbound to Morden.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} timetable allowed 18 {{minutes for}} the journey. <b>Off-peak</b> <b>service</b> frequency was every 15 minutes, increased to ten minutes during the morning peak and reduced 20 minutes in the early mornings and after 8pm. From May 1864, workmen's returns were offered on the 5:30am and 5:40am services from Paddington {{at the cost of}} a single ticket (3d).|$|E
5|$|In 1907 the weekday <b>off-peak</b> <b>service</b> {{was four}} trains per hour from East Ham to Ealing Broadway, four per hour from Mansion House to {{alternately}} Richmond and Wimbledon and two per hour from Wimbledon to High Street Kensington and Ealing Broadway to Whitechapel. Four trains per hour ran from Putney Bridge to Earl's Court, two continuing to High Street Kensington. From South Harrow {{there were two}} trains per hour to Mill Hill Park, and four trains per hour from Hounslow Barracks to Mill Hill Park, two of these continuing to South Acton.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, WMATA {{board member}} Jim Graham and D.C. Mayor Anthony A. Williams {{proposed}} re-extending Yellow Line service to Fort Totten {{or even to}} Greenbelt, which was the originally planned northern terminus for the line. Their proposal did not involve construction of any new track, because either extension would run along the same route as the existing Green Line and would thus relieve crowding on that line. Suburban {{members of the board}} initially resisted the proposal. Through a compromise that also increased service on the Red Line, on April 20, 2006 the WMATA board approved a Yellow Line extension to the Fort Totten station during off-peak hours. An 18-month pilot program began on December 31, 2006, at a cost of $5.75 million to the District of Columbia. As of 2011, the <b>off-peak</b> <b>service</b> continues.|$|E

25|$|This {{project was}} dormant from {{approximately}} 2002 to 2009, but an environmental assessment was announced by Metro-North, {{to be completed}} by 2011. The study was in conjunction with ongoing studies for the best uses of Penn Station. The study advances a single option of full (both peak and <b>off-peak)</b> <b>service</b> to Penn on the New Haven and Hudson Lines. Separate options for <b>off-peak</b> <b>service</b> are still being considered separate from the study, as implementation could take place with existing infrastructure and equipment. However, the project was delayed, so environmental and federal reviews are {{to be completed by}} 2017.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to these extensions, the frequency of service was improved. Rush hour service operated every 40 minutes, and <b>off-peak</b> <b>service</b> hourly. Selected trips also served the Yellow Brick Road industrial Park in Golden Ring.|$|E
25|$|In {{its last}} years of operation, the line saw an hourly <b>off-peak</b> <b>service</b> on weekdays, two-hourly on Sundays from Oxted to Lewes. During rush hours, the service was {{supplemented}} by trains from Victoria to Brighton via Hurst Green.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{pilot program}} {{launched}} in 1992 allowed {{up to four}} bikes per train for <b>off-peak</b> <b>service,</b> with bicycles were carried in the cab car (northernmost car). Bicycle capacity was expanded to twelve bikes per train for all trains in 1995, followed by a doubling to 24 bikes per train for all trains in 1996.|$|E

25|$|The <b>off-peak</b> <b>service</b> is one train {{per hour}} in each {{direction}} between Maidenhead and Marlow. During morning and evening peak times a two trains per hour service is achieved by using two trains: one shuttling between Marlow and Bourne End, and another between Bourne End and Maidenhead/London Paddington. This is possible because Bourne End station has two platforms {{that may be used}} simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|Express {{bus service}} is {{generally}} geared towards peak hour commuters {{from the outer}} boroughs and neighboring suburbs that lack rail or subway services to and from Midtown Manhattan or Lower Manhattan. Some routes also provide significant <b>off-peak</b> <b>service</b> from early morning to late evening, every day (notably the X10, X17, X27, X28, BxM1/2, BxM3, BxM4, BxM6, BxM7, BxM8, BxM9, BxM10, BxM11, QM2, QM4 and QM5/6; the X1 runs 24 hours a day). 45-foot MCI and Prevost over-the-road coaches are used for express service.|$|E
25|$|The mid-Sussex {{electrification}} of 1938 {{resulted in}} the express steam services from Portsmouth and Bognor Regis being replaced by electric services which were routed through Dorking, calling at Sutton and Victoria only. These gave commuters from Dorking their fastest ever link to Victoria (34 minutes during peak hours). In the timetable change of May 1978 the mid-Sussex express services were routed via Gatwick Airport and the <b>off-peak</b> <b>service</b> to Dorking was reduced to two semi-fast services from Victoria per hour, with services to Horsham running every two hours. Now the average journey time to London termini takes a passenger 55 minutes.|$|E

25|$|From June 2006, {{the service}} between East Finchley and Camden Town was {{suspended}} for two non-consecutive weekends every month, with service on the Edgware branch suspended for the other two weeks. This was part of Tube Lines's redevelopment of some Edgware and High Barnet Branch stations, including replacement of track, signals, as well as station maintenance. This included refurbishment of all High Barnet branch stations from West Finchley to Camden Town. In October 2006, <b>off-peak</b> <b>service</b> between Mill Hill East and Finchley Central was cut back to a shuttle, {{except for a few}} weekend through trains.|$|E
25|$|By 1967, {{all other}} ferries in New York City had closed due to {{competition}} by automobile traffic, and the St. George to Whitehall route {{was the only}} ferry in the city. It remained as such until the 1980s, when other ferry routes were restarted. <b>Off-peak</b> <b>service</b> was reduced in 1967, but two months later that service was restored. However, due to the city's mid-1970s financial crisis, night service ended on July 1, 1975, with alternate service being provided by the Fourth Avenue subway. Night service was restored in the 1980s after two boats, comprising the current Austen class, were ordered specifically for overnight voyages. These boats entered service in 1986.|$|E
25|$|The {{station is}} in London fare zone 6. The typical <b>off-peak</b> <b>service</b> {{from the station}} is twelve District line trains per hour to Upminster and twelve to Earl's Court, of which six {{continue}} to Ealing Broadway and six continue to Richmond. At peak periods the number of trains per hour increases to fifteen and some trains continue from Earl's Court to Wimbledon. Services towards central London operate from approximately 05:00 to 23:30 and services to Upminster operate from approximately 06:00 to 01:30. The journey time to Upminster is four minutes; to Barking is approximately 15 minutes, and to Tower Hill is approximately 40 minutes. The station has a ticket office that is open for eleven hours a week. During 2011 there were 1.98 million passenger entries and exits at the station, higher than the annual usage over the preceding two years, and typical for a suburban station.|$|E
25|$|As of 2016, six {{sets are}} {{operated}} on the Dublin-Cork route's clockface timetable. On some <b>off-peak</b> <b>services</b> smaller 22000 Class sets are used since larger sets are expensive to operate.|$|R

500|$|GO Transit's {{commuter}} rail services [...] carry {{the large majority}} of its overall ridership. Until 2012, five GO Train lines operated only during weekday rush hour periods in the peak direction (inbound towards Union Station in the morning and outbound in the afternoons and early evenings), with <b>off-peak</b> <b>service</b> on these routes being provided solely by buses. Since then, partial off-peak train service has been added to three of these lines. The present <b>off-peak</b> <b>service</b> is as follows: ...|$|E
50|$|Rush hour {{services}} provide two (inbound) morning {{services and}} one (outbound) evening service non-stop between Surbiton and Waterloo. <b>Off-peak</b> <b>services</b> run only twice per hour (once on Sundays) and are considerably slower, stopping at intermediate stations between Surbiton and Waterloo.|$|R
50|$|Introduction to the Kapiti Line was {{achieved}} in August 2011 when sufficient units became available.
