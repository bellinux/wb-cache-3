5|$|As {{animals at}} {{the summit of the}} food chain, bears do not have many predators. The most {{important}} are humans, and as they started cultivating crops, they increasingly came in conflict with the bears that raided them.

The tiger is the only four-legged predator that regularly preys <b>on</b> <b>adult</b> bears, including brown bears, sloth bears, Asiatic black bears, and sun bears.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian sparrowhawk's pale underparts {{and darker}} upperparts are {{an example of}} countershading, which helps {{to break up the}} bird's outline.

Accordingly, his return trip to Siam had to be postponed in order for him to recover in Switzerland. There he spent almost two years in Davos and later Klosters, until September 1931 when he attended the League of Nations annual conference before returning to Siam via a Nippon Yusen ship departing from Naples, Italy. He finally arrived in Siam on 23 October 1931, after spending over nine years abroad.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1943, Madgwick {{participated in}} {{government}} educational {{planning for the}} post-war years. He {{played a major role}} in the establishment of the Commonwealth Reconstruction Training Scheme to provide government assistance to ex-servicemembers to complete or undertake university education. In 1944 Madgwick and colleagues began drafting their vision for post-war adult education and articulated their vision at the Workers Education Association of New South Wales Conference, held 10–11 March 1944 in Sydney. They followed-up the conference with a formal, published paper, which called for heavy Commonwealth government involvement and expenditures <b>on</b> <b>adult</b> education. Their proposed plan, however, was rejected by the Prime Minister's office, which, to Madgwick's disappointment selected a more modest program. Madgwick's active duty service ended in March 1946 and he was transferred to reserve officer status on 19 April 1946.|$|E

Bandai Entertainment released the series as individual volumes and parts. Four volumes were released containing the first seventeen episodes and three parts contained the whole series.

Bandai Entertainment added the episodes to their YouTube channel beginning on February 1, 2009. The episodes were then made available on Crunchyroll between April 25, 2009 till December 31, 2012.

5|$|Family Guy {{had been}} {{canceled}} in 2002 due to low ratings, but was revived by Fox after reruns <b>on</b> <b>Adult</b> Swim became the cable network's most watched program, {{and more than}} three million DVDs of the show were sold. Much of the plot and many of the technical aspects of the episode, as well as the title, are direct parodies of the 1959 Alfred Hitchcock movie North by Northwest; in addition, the episode makes use of Bernard Herrmann's theme music from that film. The episode contains many cultural references; in the opening sequence Peter lists 29shows that were canceled by Fox after Family Guy was canceled and says that if all of those shows were to be canceled, they might have a chance at returning.|$|E
5|$|Homosexual arousal in {{childhood}} appeared to predict adult homosexuality, while homosexual activities and arousal during adolescence {{had a very}} strong connection with adult homosexuality. Rape and sexual molestation {{did not appear to be}} significant in the development of homosexuality. Heterosexual arousal during childhood had a very small effect <b>on</b> <b>adult</b> sexual preference. Homosexual women were more likely to have their first homosexual encounter before their first heterosexual encounter. Phenomena associated with physical maturation, such as the age at which menstruation began, did not appear to play a significant role in the development of sexual preference, while parental attitudes toward sex and failure to enjoy early heterosexual activity also seemed unimportant. Sexual feelings seemed important in the development of adult homosexuality.|$|E

5|$|In 1936 Madgwick was {{a visiting}} Harbison-Higginbotham Scholar at the University of Melbourne. The same year, Madgwick took an {{appointment}} {{as a senior}} lecturer in economic history at the University of Sydney. In this capacity, Madgwick frequently worked with the university's department of tutorial classes and helped found the Sydney University Lecturers' Association. In 1937, he accepted appointment as Secretary of the Sydney University Extension Board (SUEB), which focused <b>on</b> <b>adult</b> education in surrounding communities, including lectures, tutorial classes, and study circles. Madgwick held the position until 1940, often travelling to rural communities in the Northern Rivers and New England areas of New South Wales to present lectures.

5|$|Natural predators include wading birds, such as reef egrets, white-faced herons, white ibises and swamp harriers. Other predators include snakes, skinks, red foxes, tortoises, and eels {{and other}} fish, such as redfin perch and European carp, several {{varieties}} of gudgeon, {{and a range}} of invertebrate predators, such as the large brown mantis. Predation <b>on</b> <b>adult</b> frogs has been recorded for the red-bellied black snake, tiger snake, laughing kookaburra, and sacred kingfisher; wading birds and other snakes, such as the green tree snake and the copperhead snake, are also believed to be predators of the frog. The relative magnitude of the various predatorial threats to the frog and its tadpoles is not known. Before the frog became rare, and when subsistence lifestyles were more common, it was hunted and eaten by Australian Aborigines. It was also used in dissection demonstrations in biology classes, and caught by humans for feeding pet reptiles.|$|E
5|$|Off California, sharks {{immobilize}} northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) {{with a large}} bite to the hindquarters (which is {{the main}} source of the seal's mobility) and wait for the seal to bleed to death. This technique is especially used <b>on</b> <b>adult</b> male elephant seals, which are typically larger than the shark, ranging between , and are potentially dangerous adversaries. Most commonly though, juvenile elephant seals are the most frequently eaten at elephant seal colonies. Prey is normally attacked sub-surface. Harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) are taken from the surface and dragged down until they stop struggling. They are then eaten near the bottom. California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) are ambushed from below and struck mid-body before being dragged and eaten.|$|E
