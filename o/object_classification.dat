40|$|Abstract- In {{computer}} image processing, traditional <b>object</b> <b>classification</b> methods {{focus on}} visual {{objects such as}} cars, dogs, and airplanes. However, these objects {{are not easy to}} scale, require extensive training for all classes, and are susceptible to unseen <b>object</b> <b>classification</b> failure. Recently, a new <b>object</b> <b>classification</b> approach called attribute-based <b>object</b> <b>classification</b> has been introduced by considering visual adjectives that are easily discernible, such as “red, furry, has legs”, instead of visual objects. Based on this concept, knowledge of an unseen object’s categories can be conveyed by a description of its attributes. In this study, we proposed the first online incremental learning system for attribute-based <b>object</b> <b>classification.</b> Our proposed method can overcome online incremental learning tasks, and the learning and classification process is very fast. The presented experimental results are the first reported results of online incremental attribute-based <b>object</b> <b>classification</b> and hence can serve as a reference with which other results are compared. Moreover, our computation time is also more than 90 % faster than other offline approaches...|$|E

40|$|Remote sensing is a {{cost-effective}} way for large area land cover/land use mapping availability. The reliability of these maps {{is very important}} for many of the Earth sciences and the development of (semi) automatic classification procedures is therefore essential. As long as pixel size remains coarser than, or at the best similar, in size to the (geographical) <b>objects,</b> pixel <b>classification</b> is the most appropriate approach. With increasing spatial resolution, and also improving spectral characteristics, of satellite images “traditional” classification methods become less effective. Therefore, object-oriented classification is being used more and more frequently. <b>Object</b> based <b>classification</b> combines contextual segmentation, which is a fundamental phase of the approach, and classification itself. Segmentation divides satellite image into a relatively homogeneous and semantically significant pixel groups (segments) based on one or more criteria of homogeneity.

40|$|The {{problems}} of <b>object</b> <b>classification</b> (labeling the nodes of a graph) and link prediction (predicting the links in a graph) {{have been largely}} studied independently.
