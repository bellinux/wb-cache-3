5|$|An early {{design was}} for a version with a {{secondary}} hull, but {{it appeared to be}} too similar to the ship seen in The Original Series. That throwback styling had been partially inspired by Berman viewing the throwback concept in the 2002 Ford Thunderbird, itself a modern update of the original Thunderbird. Following that concept, the designers took the styling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>USS</b> Enterprise from The Original Series and updated it, but ultimately it looked too much like a simple update to the same vessel.|$|E

5|$|Despite Spielberg's rejection, {{the studio}} {{went ahead with}} plans to make the sequel, leading to an arduous 18-month {{pre-production}} process. Howard Sackler, who had contributed to the first film's script but chose not to be credited, was charged with writing the first draft. He originally proposed a prequel based on the sinking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>USS</b> Indianapolis, the story relayed by Quint in the first film. Although Universal president Sidney Sheinberg thought Sackler's treatment for the film was intriguing, he rejected the idea. On Sackler's recommendation, theatre and film director John D. Hancock was chosen to helm the picture. Sackler later felt betrayed when Dorothy Tristan, Hancock's wife, was invited to rewrite his script.|$|E
5|$|Elements of {{the zero}} gravity scenes were handled by Pacific Data Images, while phaser beams and {{transporter}} effects were generated by Visual Concept Engineering, {{an offshoot of}} ILM that had contributed to The Wrath of Khan and The Final Frontier. Despite the overall count of effects shots being dropped from over 100 to 51, the project was still large, and required virtually the entire ILM staff to complete. Farrar's goal was to economize the remaining effects; if three shots were similar, {{they would try to}} tell the story with only one. Cheap animatics provided Meyer with placeholders to cut into the film and avoid costly surprises. Stock footage from previous films were used whenever possible, but it was often unfeasible to do so; as the original USS Enterprise had been destroyed in , all shots <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>USS</b> Enterprise-A had to feature the updated ship registry.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the {{television}} series Hawaii Five-0 chose Battleship Cove, a housing community {{just outside the}} dock <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>USS</b> Missouri museum, as the location for an episode. The episode, with police cars racing down Tennessee and Nevada Streets, featured a number of Ford Island homes and some residents appeared as extras. That year, Peter Berg featured the USS Missouri in the film Battleship. The ship, which was towed off Ford Island for maintenance, was brought out to sea between completion of the maintenance and its return to the dock for filming. Michael Carr, president of the Battleship Missouri Memorial, hoped that the film would spike {{the number of visitors}} to the Ford Island museum.|$|E
