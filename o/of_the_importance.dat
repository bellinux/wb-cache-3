5|$|An example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of iron's {{symbolic}} role may {{be found}} in the German Campaign of 1813. Frederick William III commissioned then the first Iron Cross as military decoration. Berlin iron jewellery reached its peak production between 1813 and 1815, when the Prussian royal family urged citizens to donate gold and silver jewellery for military funding. The inscription Gold gab ich für Eisen (I gave gold for iron) was used as well in later war efforts.|$|E

5|$|Aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of causal structure, Roger Penrose {{and others}} {{developed}} {{what is known}} as global geometry. In global geometry, the object of study is not one particular solution (or family of solutions) to Einstein's equations. Rather, relations that hold true for all geodesics, such as the Raychaudhuri equation, and additional non-specific assumptions about the nature of matter (usually in the form of energy conditions) are used to derive general results.|$|E
5|$|Bethune also courted wealthy white organizations, {{such as the}} ladies' Palmetto Club. She invited {{influential}} {{white men}} to sit on her school board of trustees, gaining participation by James Gamble (of Procter & Gamble) and Thomas H. White (of White Sewing Machines). When Booker T. Washington of Tuskegee Institute visited in 1912, he advised her <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of gaining support by white benefactors for funding. Bethune had met with Washington in 1896 and was impressed by his clout with his donors.|$|E

However, at each venue her audiences dwindled and investors were non-existent. By 2002, Bryant and her second husband Charlie Dry had claimed bankruptcy in three states.

5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} silver {{is composed}} of two stable isotopes, 107Ag and 109Ag, with 107Ag being slightly more abundant (51.839% natural abundance). This almost equal abundance is rare in the periodic table. The atomic weight is 107.8682(2) u; this value is very important because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of silver compounds, particularly halides, in gravimetric analysis. Both isotopes of silver are produced in stars via the s-process (slow neutron capture), {{as well as in}} supernovas via the r-process (rapid neutron capture).|$|E

40|$|How {{might we}} measure <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> a web site? Well, it’s {{important}} if other important web sites link to it (if that sounds circular, {{just hold on}} for a moment). Suppose x 1,x 2, [...] .,xn are <b>the</b> <b>importances</b> <b>of</b> all n <b>of</b> <b>the</b> web sites in the world. We want <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> each web site to be proportional to <b>the</b> sum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>importances</b> <b>of</b> all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sites that link to it. That’s a system of equations that might look like this-x 1 = K(x 14 + x 97 + x 541) x 2 = K(x 1003 + x 3224 + x 9773 + x 10029) in which K is <b>the</b> constant <b>of</b> proportionality, and on <b>the</b> right side <b>of</b> each equation is <b>the</b> sum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>importances</b> <b>of</b> all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sites that link to {{the one on the}} left.

5|$|Throughout its range, {{the giant}} otter interacts with {{indigenous}} groups, who often practice traditional hunting and fishing.

Even when told <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of the species to ecosystems and the danger of extinction, interviewees showed little interest in continuing to coexist with the species.
