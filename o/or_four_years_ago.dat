500|$|Writing for {{entertainment}} news website Digital Spy, Daniel Kilkelly said Peggy's final episode featured [...] "plenty of poignant moments —not least the scene which saw Peggy {{standing in the}} destroyed Queen Vic and appearing completely devastated." [...] Gareth McLean from The Guardian said the use of [...] "Peggy's Theme" [...] was a [...] "suitably sentimental sendoff" [...] for the character, but said that [...] "in hindsight, Peggy should have left Walford three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> her character trapped in a cycle of increasingly samey stories that reduced her to a parody of her former self", describing her efforts {{to put out the}} flames as [...] "like a very sooty clockwork mouse". James McCarthy of Welsh newspaper Western Mail said Windsor's [...] "final emotional scene will doubtless remain the stuff of EastEnders legend for years to come," [...] and Jim Shelley from the Daily Mirror said [...] "It was a good way to go." [...] However, Shelley's colleague Polly Hudson said Peggy's exit was a [...] "non event", as [...] "Peggy just left, nonsensically and at complete odds with everything we've learnt about her character over the last 15 years." ...|$|E

"Why, no," [...] she answered, at length, [...] "I never thought----I {{see what}} you mean. <b>Four</b> <b>or</b> five <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> when I was going to socialist lectures, my sense of all this--inequality, {{injustice}} was intellectual.

6000|$|... "I {{should think}} so, but I don't suppose they watch {{as we used}} to do in the old days.

60|$|This was {{the last}} drachm {{required}} to turn the scale of her indecision. Declare the past to him {{by word of mouth}} she could not; but there was another way.

60|$|Three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> hundred <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> {{there was}} {{undoubtedly}} much less labour in England, {{in proportion to}} the population, than at present, but there was much more dependence, and we probably should not now enjoy our present degree of civil liberty if the poor, by the introduction of manufactures, had not been enabled to give something in exchange for the provisions of the great Lords, instead of being dependent upon their bounty. Even the greatest enemies of trade and manufactures, and I do not reckon myself a very determined friend to them, must allow that when they were introduced into England, liberty came in their train.|$|R
60|$|The palace {{has some}} {{handsome}} old furniture, and gilded chairs, covered with leather cases, possibly relics of Queen Christina's time, who died here. I know not {{but the most}} curious object was a curule chair of marble, sculptured all out of one piece, and adorned with bas-reliefs. It {{is supposed to be}} Etruscan. It has a circular back, sweeping round, so as to afford sufficient rests for the elbows; and, sitting down in it, I discovered that modern ingenuity has not made much real improvement on this chair of three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> thousand <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> But some chairs are easier for the moment, yet soon betray you, and grow the more irksome.|$|R
60|$|We have lately {{made the}} {{acquaintance}} {{of an old}} lady of ninety, who has passed the last twenty-five years of her old life in a great metropolitan establishment, the workhouse, namely, of the parish of Saint Lazarus. Stay -- twenty-three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> she came out once, and thought to earn a little money by hop- picking; but being overworked, and having to lie out at night, she got a palsy which has incapacitated her from all further labour, and has caused her poor old limbs to shake ever since.|$|E
6000|$|... "So I did, Sir Charles," [...] Finglemore answered, {{rubbing his}} hands {{somewhat}} nervously. [...] "But {{he never went}} there. Being an idle young dog, {{with a taste for}} amusement, he got for the time no further than Paris. Since then, he's hung about a bit, here, there, and everywhere, and done no particular good for himself or his family. But about three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> he somehow 'struck ile': he went to South Africa, poaching on your preserves; and now he's back again--rich, married, and respectable. His wife, a nice little woman, has reformed him. Well, what can I do for you this morning?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm so {{glad you}} look at it in that way. WE like it. We {{discovered}} it three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> and we never let a summer slip, if we can help it, without coming here for a week or a month. The place," [...] I enlarged, [...] "has the charm of ruin, though it's in such obvious repair; it has a past; it's so completely gone by in a society sense. The cottage life here hasn't killed the hotel life, as it has at Newport and Bar Harbour; but the ideal of cottage life everywhere else has made hotel life at Saratoga ungenteel. The hotels are full, {{but at the same time}} they are society solitudes." ...|$|E

"Oh, {{it was an}} odd thing, joining on {{strangely enough}} with one I had three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> and twenty <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> when I was a young man, hearing lectures at Edinburgh, and courting--" [...] he stopped, and felt Margaret's pulse, asked her a few questions, and talked to the baby. Ethel longed to hear his dream, but thought he would not like to go on; however, he did presently.|$|R
5000|$|Denver {{explained}} this {{himself in the}} liner notes by {{saying that he had}} picked the numbers most requested in his concerts, but that [...] "I felt that some of these songs had grown a bit, that I am singing better than I was <b>four</b> <b>or</b> five <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> and that I would like to treat some of the songs a little differently than I had in the original recordings." ...|$|R

6000|$|I was {{surprised}} to hear a queer sort of laugh, and saw Davidson standing unsteadily {{in the middle of}} the room, with a dazzled look on his face. My first impression was that he was drunk. He did not notice me. He was clawing out at something invisible a yard in front of his face. He put out his hand, slowly, rather hesitatingly, and then clutched nothing. [...] "What's come to it?" [...] he said. He held up his hands to his face, fingers spread out. [...] "Great Scot!" [...] he said. The thing happened three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> when everyone swore by that personage. Then he began raising his feet clumsily, as though he had expected to find them glued to the floor.|$|E
60|$|Three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> I got in {{conversation}} with a heath-cutter on Milford Common, a singular and brutal-looking fellow, of the half-Gypsy Devil's Punch-Bowl type, described so ably by Baring-Gould in his Broom Squire. He {{told me that when}} he was a boy, about thirty-five years ago, the furze wren was common in all that part of the country, until Smithers' offer of a shilling for every clutch of eggs, had set the boys from all the villages in the district hunting for the nests. Many a shilling had he been paid for the nests he found, but in a few years the birds became rare; and he added that he had not now seen one for a very long time.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; we {{have found}} a first-rate place, but the Apaches drove us off from it when we had been at work only four days, {{and we have had}} hard work to save our scalps. I have no {{objection}} to give you the indications, for I will not go back again among them ramping Apaches not to find solid gold. There is the map as I steered by. Them three points are the Three Sisters, and that tree bears on the mouth of a narrow canyon. There is gold there, you bet, and likewise the skeletons of about thirty Mexicans who got killed there three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> Now, let us have some grub; we finished our last ounce of flour yesterday, and have been short for the last fortnight." ...|$|E
60|$|Three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> hundred <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> in the sad {{silence that}} had {{followed}} the comparative failure of the noble effort of the Middle Ages, there came upon all Europe a storm out of the south. Its tumult is of many tongues; one can hear in it the laughter of Rabelais, or, for that matter, the lyrics of Shakespeare; but the dark heart of the storm was indeed more austral and volcanic; a noise of thunderous wings {{and the name of}} Michael the Archangel. And when it had shocked and purified the world and passed, a Prussian professor found a feather fallen to earth; and proved (in several volumes) that it could only have come from a Prussian Eagle. He had seen one--in a cage.|$|R

And then do ye wait and see more; there'll be plenty of opportunity. Time enough to cry when you know 'tis a crying matter; and 'tis bad to meet troubles half-way." ...|$|R
50|$|Jet Li {{hoped the}} movie will {{encourage}} people {{pay more attention}} and dedicate their compassion to charity.

60|$|Some three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> {{before the}} glorious {{principles}} of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity had made short shrift of all such pestilential aristocrats, the ci-devant banker, then a widower with an only daughter, Esther, had journeyed to England. He soon returned to Paris, however, {{and went on}} living there with his little girl in comparative retirement, until his many crimes found him out at last and he was made to suffer the punishment which he so justly deserved. Those crimes consisted {{for the most part}} in humiliating the aforesaid deserving patriots with his benevolence, shaming them with many kindnesses, and the simplicity of his home-life, and, above all, in flouting the decrees of the Revolutionary Government, which made every connection with ci-devant churches and priests a penal offence against the security of the State.|$|E
60|$|Muriel did not answer. The {{turn their}} {{conversation}} had taken had {{filled her with}} a vague unrest as {{she looked back at}} the life she had led. Three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> it had seemed filled with glamour and excitement, and she had entered on its pleasures with eager zest, but of late she had begun to find them wearisome. They no longer satisfied her. If this were the result of a few years' experience, what would she feel when she had grown jaded with time and everything was stale? Then her glimpse of the simple, healthful western life had come as a revelation. It was real, a bracing struggle, in which no effort was wasted but produced tangible results: broad stretches of splendid wheat, sweeps of azure flax.|$|E
60|$|In the morning, having fairly scudded {{before the}} gale, we arrived {{by the middle}} of the day at the Sauce posta. On the road we saw great numbers of deer, and near the {{mountain}} a guanaco. The plain, which abuts against the Sierra, is traversed by some curious gulleys, of which one was about twenty feet wide, and at least thirty deep; we were obliged in consequence to make a considerable circuit before we could find a pass. We stayed the night at the posta, the conversation, as was generally the case, being about the Indians. The Sierra Ventana was formerly a great place of resort; and three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> there was much fighting there. My guide had been present when many Indians were killed: the women escaped to the top of the ridge, and fought most desperately with great stones; many thus saving themselves.|$|E
60|$|About {{the year}} 1777, Captain Cook {{estimated}} {{the population of}} Tahiti at about two hundred thousand. By a regular census, taken some <b>four</b> <b>or</b> five <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> it {{was found to be}} only nine thousand. This amazing decrease not only shows the malignancy of the evils necessary to produce it; but, from the fact, the inference unavoidably follows that all the wars, child murders, and other depopulating causes, alleged to have existed in former times, were nothing in comparison to them.|$|R
60|$|To {{go back to}} the carved-oak question, {{they must}} have had very fair notions of the artistic and the beautiful, our great-great-grandfathers. Why, all our art treasures of to-day are only the dug-up commonplaces of three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> hundred <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> I wonder if there is real {{intrinsic}} beauty in the old soup-plates, beer-mugs, and candle-snuffers that we prize so now, or if it is only the halo of age glowing around them that gives them their charms in our eyes. The “old blue” that we hang about our walls as ornaments were the common every-day household utensils of a few centuries ago; and the pink shepherds and the yellow shepherdesses that we hand round now for all our friends to gush over, and pretend they understand, were the unvalued mantel-ornaments that the mother of the eighteenth century would have given the baby to suck when he cried.|$|R
