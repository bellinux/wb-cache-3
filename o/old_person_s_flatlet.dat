40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to gain {{knowledge}} of how Registered Nurses (RN) are able to work together with family members of older people living in community elder care facilities. A questionnaire was distributed to all RNs (N= 314) with permanent appointments in community elder care in one province, and 67 percent (n = 210) answered after two reminders (I, II). The age of the participants was from 23 to 64 years {{and half of the}} participants worked in urban areas. About half of the participants had experience of work in elder care of five years or more. Study I focused on the RNs view of co-operation with family members of the <b>old</b> <b>person</b> and what influenced that co-operation. The working situation for RNs in community elder care showed that nearly half, 46 % of the RNs were not satisfied with their working situation. It was the nurses with more than five years of working experience that were unhappy with their working situation. The limited organisational and personnel resources influenced their ability to co-operate with the family members. The RNs expressed dissatisfaction and frustration when they could not spend enough time caring for the old people or communicating with their family members. The RNs believed that it was important for family members to show their involvement in the care of the <b>old</b> <b>person.</b> The results showed that cooperation would be more complicated if there was a conflict of interest between the RN and the family member. Furthermore, the RN pointed out the importance of family members taking care of the <b>older</b> <b>person</b> <b>s</b> interest. Study II focused on what the RNs described as positive, negative or problematic in their cooperation with family members of old people. Content analysis was used in the analysis of the three open-ended questions. Three themes emerged from the answers of the three open-ended questions, namely Problems within the system, Interaction with families and Caring in nursing work. The co-operation between the RN and the family member was especially important when the <b>old</b> <b>person</b> was suffering from dementia. An exchange of information about the person before illness was especially important as it was then possible to provide better care and understanding for the <b>old</b> <b>person.</b> The development of community elder care will put increasing demands on the RNs in community elder care in the future and {{there is a need for}} further support and guidance. Her working situation involves both working alone and being a part of a team. Informal care giving is also expected to increase as the elder population increases and by that the registered nurse will be even more important in community elder care as more persons are dependent on her competence. Conclusions drawn imply that the RN in community elder care is dependent on the organization of elder care and the organization is dependent on RNs competence...|$|R
40|$|The overall aim of {{the thesis}} is to study the {{expectations}} of the co- workers on registered nurses and to study the registered nurses descriptions of their working experiences in order to obtain an understanding of the registered nurses work situation in residential care homes. The thesis includes four studies and the method is based on a qualitative approach. Studies; I, II and III illuminate the nurse assistants (I), the care managers (II) and the physicians (III) perspectives regarding registered nurses responsible for providing nursing care to the older people living in residential care homes. The data analysis was based on a phenomenological hermeneutical method and was used for studies I, II and III. Study IV describes the registered nurses own experiences of their working situation. Latent content analysis was used for the data analysing process. A comprehensive interpretation of study I, II and III indicates paradoxes in the meaning of the expectations that can be incompatible for nurses in specific nursing care situations. The first paradox in these expectations is to be autonomous and make independent decisions {{and at the same time}} experience limitations in decision-making and leadership. The second paradox was to act as a leader and at the same time be an equal and subordinate. The third paradox was to ensure a holistic view of care and at the same time keep within own area of practice. The meaning of nursing aides, social workers and physicians expectations of nurses was the experience of both moral and ethical dilemmas, feelings of frustration and powerlessness in specific nursing care situations. The results in study IV show that nurses experience of their work situation was that they were valued and appreciated but also felt that they were depreciated and frustrated. When the nurses experienced that they were appreciated and valued, it confirmed their autonomy in nursing care and they felt that others trusted their competence. When they were allowed to expand social service in order to provide nursing care they also felt appreciated. The nurses expectations on themselves and by others included to have knowledge in many areas, ability to be able to interpret and understand the specific situation from the <b>older</b> <b>person</b> <b>s</b> health and life situation and to be able to work together with other professionals The nurses were expected to alternate in their approach to the <b>older</b> <b>person</b> based on the particular situation, at times providing care in the hospital and other times, in the private home. The nurses experienced frustration when they were not permitted to decide on extended social service, resources and competence that were necessary for nursing care. They experienced a moral dilemma when they did not have a colleague that could take over at the end of their work day. A moral dilemma was also experienced when the nurses felt that they were not able to live up to the expectation of being accessible, which was an expectation expressed by nurse assistants, care managers and physicians. The nurses experienced that colleagues and physicians in other areas were not aware of their work situation. There is a need for an organisation with a flexible structure in which the authoritative responsibility is regulated by the needs of the <b>older</b> <b>person</b> and not the professional position. When the <b>older</b> <b>person</b> has multiple nursing care needs and end of life care, the nurse would take leadership with the authority to make decisions concerning resources and competence. The education of nurses would adapt the residential care homes as a new context for nursing care and develop the education and the subject gerontological nursing care for this field...|$|R
40|$|The {{incidence}} of increased life span {{as well as}} a lack of care for <b>older</b> <b>persons,</b> gave rise to the South African Older persons Act (Act No 13 of 2006), which guides society in how our <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> should be treated. This Act also provides a clear indication of the expectations of caring for <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> within communities and families. Many <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> people rely on the relationships they have with their children in their golden years, to be fulfilling and loving. This study therefore aimed to explore the experiences of <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> and their adult children on maintaining positive relationships in order for the relationship to be most beneficial for both <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> and their adult children. The quality of relationships between adult children and <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> according to Newby (2010) can ease participation of adult children in the lives of <b>older</b> <b>persons.</b> This study was conducted from a qualitative research perspective that is exploratory, descriptive and contextual in nature. The exploratory-descriptive design allowed the researcher to understand the topic by using a narrative strategy of inquiry. A non-probability purposive sampling method was applied to identify five <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> as well as the adult children of these <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> who are retirees of an automotive company in South Africa. Individual, semi-structured face to face interviews were conducted with <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> as well as with at least one of their adult children who did not reside with them. Thematic data analysis technique was used to analyse the data collected. The study is viewed as significant in enhancing the understanding of satisfying and caring relationships between <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> and their adult children in order to add to the body of existing knowledge in social gerontology and to improve direct social work practice with <b>older</b> <b>persons...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives: Apathy is a {{behavioral}} syndrome that often co-occurs with depression. Nonetheless, {{the etiology of}} apathy and depression may be different. We hypothesized that apathy occurs more often in depressed compared to non-depressed older persons; and that independent correlates for apathy will be different in depressed and non-depressed <b>older</b> <b>persons.</b> Methods: In this cross-sectional study of Netherlands Study of Depression in Older Persons (NESDO), a total of 350 depressed <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> according to the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and 126 non-depressed <b>older</b> <b>persons,</b> aged at least 60 years were recruited in several Medical Centres and general practices. In both depressed and non-depressed <b>older</b> <b>persons,</b> those with and without apathy as assessed with the Apathy Scale (score ≥ 14) were compared with regard to socio-demographic, clinical, and biological characteristics. Results: Apathy was present in 75 % of the depressed and 25 % of the non- depressed <b>older</b> <b>persons.</b> Independent correlates of apathy in both depressed and non-depressed <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> were male gender and less education. Furthermore, in depressed <b>older</b> <b>persons,</b> {{higher scores on the}} Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS) and, in non-depressed <b>older</b> <b>persons,</b> a higher C-reactive protein (CRP) level correlated independently with apathy. Conclusions: Apathy occurred frequently among both depressed and non-depressed <b>older</b> <b>persons.</b> Among depressed <b>older</b> <b>persons,</b> apathy appeared to be a symptom of more serious depression, whereas among non-depressed persons apathy was associated with increased CRP being a marker for immune activation, suggesting a different aetiology for apathy in its own right...|$|R
40|$|As <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> are {{steadily}} increasing {{in number and}} there are no specialized comprehensive healthcare services for <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> in Indonesia, including East Kalimantan, the aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the extent of the problems facing healthcare staff and officials in Tarakan City, East Kalimantan, in providing comprehensive healthcare services attuned to the needs of <b>older</b> <b>persons.</b> This study was a qualitative interview-based survey with focus group discussions, involving heads and healthcare officials of seven puskesmas in Tarakan City, East Kalimantan district, with the addition of a number of district health planning officials. The results revealed a difference between daily hospital referral rate of <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> by puskesmas staff and actual daily hospital admission rate for the referrals. None of the consulted healthcare staff had any speciality education in geriatrics or <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> health. The <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> most frequently presented to the hospital with hypertension, diabetes, and myocardial insufficiency. On the other hand, at the health centers the presenting conditions were hypertension, gastroenteritis, rheumatism, sleep disorders, and upper respiratory tract infections. Improved access to healthcare for <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> should be achieved by improving knowledge and skills of human resources, including communication skills, and of supporting healthcare service infrastructure at puskesmas, specifically oriented towards the needs of and designed for use by <b>older</b> <b>persons,</b> such as ramps for wheelchairs, and handrails in corridors.

40|$|Aims. The goal of {{this brief}} review is to address studies {{examining}} the relationship between physical inactivity and pain in aging and dementia. Background. A decrease {{in the level of}} physical activity is characteristic of <b>older</b> <b>persons,</b> both with and without dementia. Passive behaviour is often considered {{to be part of the}} apathy frequently observed in patients with dementia, although it could also be a sign of pain. Design. Literature review. Method. Searches were performed in PubMed and Embase. A total of 15 studies concerning the relationship between physical inactivity and pain in <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> with and without dementia were identified (<b>older</b> <b>persons</b> without dementia: 12; with dementia: 3). Results. In <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> without dementia, a positive relationship between physical inactivity and pain has been demonstrated. In <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> with dementia, pain may cause physical inactivity and physical inactivity may cause pain. Conclusions. In <b>older</b> <b>persons,</b> a positive relationship between physical inactivity and pain was demonstrated. More specifically, pain may cause physical inactivity. In <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> with dementia pain may cause physical inactivity and vice versa. Relevance to clinical practice. Nurses' awareness of physical inactivity as an indication of pain in <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> with and without dementia may reduce the risk of underdiagnosis and subsequent undertreatment of pain. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Aging is a {{significant}} social issue today. In many Asian countries, the increase of the population percentage of <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> has put great pressure on governments, related departments and organisations, private companies, and non-government organisations serving <b>older</b> <b>persons.</b> Despite their efforts, <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> still face {{a certain degree of}} exclusion and continue to receive limited concern and assistance in their daily lives.

Moreover, the healthcare sector serves four-fifths of the country's population and primary healthcare (PHC) facilities are overcrowded, and thus professional nurses are prevented from providing sufficient self-care health education to <b>older</b> <b>persons.</b> Aim: To develop guidelines for the three role players – the public health sector, professional nurse and <b>older</b> <b>person</b> – to facilitate self-care among <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> in South Africa. Design: Quantitative, descriptive, explorative and contextual research design. Methods: A literature review followed by a self-care assessment of a sample of <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> using the Appraisal of Self-care Agency (ASA-A) and Exercise of Self-care Agency (ESCA) questionnaires {{which led to the}} identification of conclusions and self-care deficits.

40|$|Introduction: The Swedish {{national}} {{guidelines for}} elderly care describe how <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> {{should be able}} to trust that their care is permeated with security. Different theoretical perspectives can be found that describe what creates security. Many studies have been done about security. However, few studies have explicitly asked <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> what security in nursing homes means to them. Aim: The aim {{of the study was to}} describe how <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> in nursing homes talked and reflected about security in their daily lives. Method: Nine <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> were interviewed in, in-depth interviews one to three times and the resulting data was analysed using content analysis. Results: The <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> adapted to having their own needs and those of the other <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> met and to the staff routines which created a sense of security. At the same time, they longed for security in which they could trust themselves and create their own daily life. Further to have a sense of belonging and of being liked for created an internal, interpersonal and external security. This can be linked to an ontological security which means having a sense of confidence in the continuity of self-identity and order in events, a being in the world.

40|$|Film {{watching}} is {{a popular}} leisure activity in modern society. Films, as a medium, provide powerful tools to deliver social messages and to create images of particular social groups. The cinematic images portrayed by films toward a particular social group may consequently shape our social perceptions and expectations of that social group. The ways that cinematic images portray <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> are, therefore, a potentially major source for detecting social values and views about them. As some cinematic images tend to reflect social attitudes and behaviours, the present research aimed at investigating how popular films portray the images of <b>older</b> <b>persons.</b> Focus was on the examination of: 1) the representation of <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> in Hong Kong movies, 2) whether <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> are positively or negatively portrayed in movies, and 3) any changes in the cinematic images of <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> {{over the last two}} decades.

The sampled films were derived from the three highest-turnover movies for each year from 1981 to 2001. Content analysis was employed in this study to determine the representation and images of <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> in the 63 sampled movies. Generally speaking, <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> were found to be under-represented in the sampled movies relative to their presence in the population. Older persons were portrayed as having white hair, wrinkle skin, and walk independently in terms of physical appearance. Older persons were also portrayed as having generally good health status. However, <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> were portrayed to have a decline in both family status and socio-economic status in the 1990 s as compared to that of the 1980 s. In terms of occupation, most <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> were portrayed as retired persons in the movies. Apart from these features, the present research also found that there was a gender differences in the portrayal of <b>older</b> <b>persons.</b> Many <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> were depicted in the movies in the home setting, perhaps reinforcing traditional Asian family values and stereotypes. However, this perhaps underplays older persons’ active roles and contributions in the light of such current concepts as productive and active aging. There is a temporal division in that <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> in many movies of the 1980 s were portrayed as more home-based while, in the 1990 s, they were becoming more actively involved in external activities...|$|R

An {{exploratory}} research design {{together with a}} qualitative research approach was chosen {{in order to obtain}} knowledge, insight and understanding regarding the socio-emotional experience of <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> with visual impairments. The motivation for this study resulted from a lack of recent research related to the socio-emotional experience of <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> with visual impairments. The researcher became aware of this lack of recent literature during a preliminary literature investigation. The need for updated research in this field was confirmed by the Department of Social Work and the Department of Ophthalmology at Tygerberg Hospital. The goal of the study is therefore {{to gain a better understanding}} of the socio-emotional experience of <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> with visual impairments in order to provide guidelines for social work intervention with these <b>older</b> <b>persons.</b> The literature study firstly focused on the life-stage of <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> in order to gain a better understanding of the developmental needs and tasks during old age focussing especially on the significance of visual competency in this life-stage. The literature study also included the theoretical framework that guides the social worker’s task, in this study the focus was on the ecological perspective. Primarily, the literature study explored the socio-emotional experiences of <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> affected by visual impairments and the social work interventions that are available for <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> with visual impairments. The researcher decided to involve ten <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> (65 years of age or older) with visual impairments who are from the service-area of Tygerberg Hospital in the research. A qualitative investigation was carried out by means of conducting semi-structured interviews with the aid of an interview guide. The results of the investigation largely confirmed the findings of the literature study namely that visual impairment severely impacts the daily functioning of <b>older</b> <b>persons.</b> These socio-emotional challenges include: aspects related to family and/or friends; psychosocial implications of vision loss on daily activities like: driving, shopping, sport, television, needlework/ knitting, and reading; and a lack of knowledge regarding available services for <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> with visual impairments...|$|R
