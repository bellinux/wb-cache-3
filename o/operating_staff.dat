25|$|The typical {{passenger}} service {{consisted of}} two trains per day each way between Owen Sound and Toronto; {{there was only one}} return trip each day from Teeswater to Orangeville. Orangeville had three trains a day to and from Toronto. Freight traffic over the Caledon Hills and the heights near Dundalk required powerful 4-6-0 and 2-8-0 locomotives, which seem to have handled the traffic comfortably, although trains often had to be divided between Mono Road and Charleston (Caledon). The small narrow-gauge engines were able to cope with normal winter weather, but there were major blockages of the line in the 'snowbelt' country above Orangeville, which sometimes closed the line for several weeks. The TG was sometimes unable, for many months, to pay the overtime wages for manually clearing these drifts. There were few public accidents, but a severe toll of industrial fatalities to the <b>operating</b> <b>staff.</b> The most dangerous job was Brakesman, with many young men being crippled or killed when walking along the tops of vehicles to manually screw down brakes, and when manually coupling cars using the highly dangerous link-and-pin couplers. The worst incident on the TG occurred at Arthur when a passenger was killed, by shots fired at a train crew, by drunken members of the Orange Order on July 12 1872.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Fire {{is one of}} the fearful and morbid {{accident}} {{for each}} of members in the operating room team and important destructive accidents for each surgery patient that may occur during surgery. This study has been carried out to evaluate awareness of <b>operating</b> room <b>staff</b> about fire sources and its prevention methods in operating room. Methods and Materials: In this cross-sectional study a number of 48 persons of <b>operating</b> room <b>staff</b> from Shahroud Imam Hossein and Fatemiyeh hospitals were chosen and their awareness about fire sources (ignition Sources, oxygen sources and fuel sources) and ways of fire prevention in operating room were assessed using designed questionnaire related to prevention and fire safety in the operating room. Mean of participation’s awareness about above-mentioned fields, upon 0 - 100 was divided to three levels: poor, intermediate and good. The data were analyzed using SPSS, software. Results: Based on the results, 97. 9 % of participants declare that educational program related to prevention and fire safety in operating room is necessary and all of them told these programs are useful and important. 85. 4 % of participants declare that never passed any educational course related to prevention and fire safety in operating room. Mean of participation’s awareness about prevention and fire safety in operating room was estimated 15. 7 in anesthesiologist, 13. 1 operating room technicians, 12. 4 anesthesia technicians and 10. 9 surgeons. In general 60. 4 % of <b>operating</b> room <b>staff</b> had intermediate awareness, 33. 3 % poor awareness and 6. 3 % good awareness about fire and its prevention in operating room. Conclusion: According to the results, unfortunately majority of <b>operating</b> room <b>staff</b> are not aware of fire sources and its prevention methods in operating room. Thus further research for improving awareness of <b>operating</b> room <b>staff</b> about prevention and control of fire in operating room is recommended...|$|R
