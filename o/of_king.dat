Their southernmost point was Tumme, known to have been south-west of Lake Urmia, and their northern one Daiaeni. These lands are known from the list of defeated kings: [...] "the <b>king</b> <b>of</b> Tumme, the <b>king</b> <b>of</b> Tunube, the <b>king</b> <b>of</b> Tuali, the <b>king</b> <b>of</b> Kindari, the <b>king</b> <b>of</b> Uzula, the <b>king</b> <b>of</b> Unzamuni the <b>king</b> <b>of</b> Andiabe, the <b>king</b> <b>of</b> Pilakinni, the <b>king</b> <b>of</b> Aturgini, the <b>king</b> <b>of</b> Kulibarzini, the <b>king</b> <b>of</b> Shinibirni, the <b>king</b> <b>of</b> Himua, the <b>king</b> <b>of</b> Paiteri, the <b>king</b> <b>of</b> Uiram, the <b>king</b> <b>of</b> Shururia, the <b>king</b> <b>of</b> Albaia, the <b>king</b> <b>of</b> Ugina, the <b>king</b> <b>of</b> Nazabia, the <b>king</b> <b>of</b> Abarsiuni, and the <b>king</b> <b>of</b> Daiaeni."
