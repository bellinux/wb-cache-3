However NDIR systems remain too expensive for many consumer and automotive apphcations. The cost of the infrared (<b>IR)</b> <b>emitter</b> component is {{a substantial part of}} the total system cost. In this paper we report of a single filament <b>IR</b> <b>emitter</b> that is fabricated using wire bonding technology. Our fabrication approach offers the prospect of a fully automated assembly by means of utihzing a wire bonding tool to integrate the single filament to the MEMS structured silicon substrate. An apphcation-specific wire bond trajectory enables the mechanical attachment of the filament to form the meander-shaped emitter with a total area of 1 mm 2.

40|$|Conference Name: 34 th Conference on Infrared Technology and Applications. Conference Address: Orlando, FL. Time:MAR 17 - 20, 2008. The silicon-based MEMS (MEMS: {{microelectromechanical}} systems) Infrared (<b>IR)</b> <b>emitter</b> {{arrays of}} 1 x 2, 2 x 2 and 3 x 3 elements are presented. The MEMS infrared emitters were fabricated on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer. The resistively heated poly-silicon membrane fabricated by using deep {{reactive ion etching}} (DRIE) process on backside of SOI wafer make a low thermal mass structure, thus this IR-emitter can be modulated at high frequency. A heavily boron doping technology enable the supporting silicon layer to absorb the infrared radiation. As a result, the self-heating effect will reduce the power loss. By using the SOI wafer, the fabrication processes are simplified, and the production costs are decreased. In experiment, the surface temperature distribution of <b>IR</b> <b>emitter</b> arrays were measured by thermal imaging system, and the optical spectrum and modulation characteristics were measured by spectroradiometer. The measured {{results show that the}} <b>IR</b> <b>emitter</b> arrays exhibit a strong emission in middle infrared range, and the modulation frequency at 50 % modulation depth is about 30 Hz.

50|$|A {{new method}} was {{developed}} to compensate for display technologies other than CRT. It relies on one or several infrared light emitters placed near the screen, and <b>one</b> <b>IR</b> sensor on the muzzle of the gun.

Since this intensity depends upon both distance and relative angle to the screen, angle sensors are located in the gun. This way a trigonometric equation system is solved, and the muzzle's 3D position relative to the screen is calculated. Then, by projecting the muzzle on the screen with the measured angles the impact point is determined.
