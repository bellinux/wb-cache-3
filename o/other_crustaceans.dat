5|$|The {{crustacean}} {{group is}} usually {{treated as a}} subphylum, and thanks to recent molecular studies it is now well accepted that the crustacean group is paraphyletic, and comprises all animals in the Pancrustacea clade other than hexapods. Some crustaceans are {{more closely related to}} insects and other hexapods than they are to certain <b>other</b> <b>crustaceans.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of crustaceans are aquatic and the isopods {{are one of}} the few groups of which some members now live on land. The only <b>other</b> <b>crustaceans</b> which include a small number of terrestrial species are amphipods (like sandhoppers) and decapods (crabs, shrimp, etc.). Terrestrial isopods play an important role in many tropical and temperate ecosystems by aiding in the decomposition of plant material through mechanical and chemical means, and by enhancing the activity of microbes. Macro-detritivores, including terrestrial isopods, are absent from arctic and sub-arctic regions, but have the potential to expand their range with increased temperatures in high latitudes.|$|E
50|$|Like any <b>other</b> <b>crustacean</b> {{the bamboo}} shrimp will molt {{in order to}} grow. During this process the shrimp is very {{vulnerable}} to predation so ample hiding spaces should be provided e.g. small cave structures, dense foliage, etc.|$|R
50|$|Branchinella spinosa is {{a species}} {{within the family}} Thamnocephalidae. This fairy shrimp species occurs in parts of Southern Africa, notably the Makgadikgadi Pans of Botswana. <b>Other</b> <b>crustacean</b> species found in this region of Botswana in co-existence with B. spinosa include Moina belli.|$|R
50|$|A prime {{food for}} these birds is the {{cape rock lobster}} Jasus lalandii, and their feeding {{distribution}} closely matches the kelp beds where these lobsters live, though the birds will also take a variety of <b>other</b> <b>crustacean</b> and fish prey, notably bearded goby Sufflogobius bibarbatus.|$|R
5|$|The {{reticulate}} whipray preys on {{a variety}} of benthic and neritic organisms, including crabs, shrimps, mantis shrimps, bivalves, gastropods, worms, jellyfish, and bony fishes. In the western Indian Ocean, about two-thirds of its diet consists of fishes, in particular ponyfish and anchovies, with shrimps and <b>other</b> <b>crustaceans</b> making up most of the remainder. By contrast, rays in Australian waters are apparently not piscivorous, and are known to consume penaeid prawns. Known parasites of this species include Anthrobothrium loculatum, Dendromonocotyle colorni, Halysiorhynchus macrocephalus, Monocotyle helicophallus, M. multiparous, and M. spiremae, Thaumatocotyle australensis, and Tylocephalum chiralensis.|$|E
5|$|Like <b>other</b> <b>crustaceans,</b> malacostracans {{have an open}} {{circulatory system}} in which the heart pumps blood into the hemocoel (body cavity) where it {{supplies}} the needs of the organs for oxygen and nutrients before diffusing back to the heart. The typical respiratory pigment in malacostracans is haemocyanin. Structures that function as kidneys are located near the base of the antennae. A brain exists in the form of ganglia close to the antennae, there are ganglia in each segment and a collection of major ganglia below the oesophagus. Sensory organs include compound eyes (often stalked), ocelli (simple eyes), statocysts and sensory bristles. The naupliar eye is a characteristic of the nauplius larva and consists of four cup-shaped ocelli facing in different directions and able to distinguish between light and darkness.|$|E
5|$|Crustaceans, such as sand fiddler {{crabs and}} shrimp, among the {{mangroves}} also occupy a significant {{place in the}} local economy. While {{a large number of}} shrimp species inhabit the Senegambian area, a single family exists in Casamance: Penaeidae. Southern pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus notialis) are the most commonly collected. They were traditionally caught as part of local artisan fishing by men, women, and children. Shrimp collection in the area experienced significant development in the 1960s, following the establishment of European industrial units. The local fishermen switched to this method, and there was an increased presence of fishermen from other areas. A study in 2005 revealed {{the extent to which the}} shrimp population in the region has been depleted, citing multiple causes, including diminishing rainfall, over-salinization of the estuary, and poorly controlled harvesting. Along with the mangrove degradation, the civil unrest, and the inadequate fishery regulation, Casamance has had to deal with the closure in 2003 of a major industrial complex in Ziguinchor which treated and exported shrimp and <b>other</b> <b>crustaceans</b> and employed more than 2,000 people.|$|E

5|$|The American white ibis {{prefers to}} eat {{crayfish}} and <b>other</b> <b>crustaceans,</b> but also takes aquatic insects and small fish. Outside the nesting season, the diet is highly variable, as abundance {{and types of}} prey depend on the both region and habitat. In Los Llanos, located {{on the border of}} Colombia and Venezuela, the most frequent prey are insects, such as fly larvae and beetles. Generally in North America the main prey are crustaceans, mostly crayfish. In the Everglades and cypress swamps, the diet is primarily made up of crayfish, while those that feed in willow ponds eat predominantly fish. American white ibises that feed in mangrove swamps focus on crabs. The tactile nature of the ibis's probing for food in mud means that it catches prey that are too slow to evade the ibis once located by its bill. In the Everglades, this means that crayfish make up {{a large part of the}} diet, but a more diverse array of invertebrates are taken in coastal areas. Although crayfish are sought by foraging ibises, prey switching to fish does occur if fish are found in great abundance. It is unclear whether the fish are more easily caught if overcrowded, or whether sheer numbers of fish mean that ibises are catching them instead of crayfish—normally, fish are more agile than crayfish and hence elude the ibis's bill more easily. Fish are a more energy-rich source of food for the American white ibis. In the breeding season, American white ibises in a colony at Pumpkinseed Island travelled further to forage in freshwater wetlands and catch crayfish, than nearby saltwater areas where fiddler crabs predominated, indicating their benefit was worth the extra energy expended in fetching them for their young. This travel results in the wholesale transport of nutrients across the landscape by the colony; in a successful breeding year the colony at Pumpkinseed Island was estimated to have contributed a third as much phosphorus to the neighboring estuary as other environmental processes.|$|E
25|$|Oarfish feed {{primarily}} on zooplankton, selectively straining tiny euphausiids, shrimp, and <b>other</b> <b>crustaceans</b> from the water. Small fish, jellyfish, and squid are also taken. Large open-ocean carnivores are all likely predators of oarfish.|$|E
25|$|Freshwater {{crayfish}} embryos {{differ from}} those of <b>other</b> <b>crustaceans</b> in having 40 ectoteloblast cells, rather than around 19. The larvae show abbreviated development, and hatch with a full complement of adult appendages with the exceptions of the uropods and the first pair of pleopods.|$|E
25|$|Compared to <b>other</b> <b>crustacean</b> groups, {{such as the}} Isopoda, Rhizocephala or Copepoda, {{relatively}} few amphipods are parasitic on other animals. The most notable example of parasitic amphipods are the whale lice (family Cyamidae); unlike other amphipods, these are dorso-ventrally flattened, and have large, strong claws, with which they attach themselves to baleen whales. They are the only parasitic crustaceans which cannot swim during any part of their life cycle.|$|R
2500|$|In the Branchiopoda, {{the most}} basal group of crustaceans, {{there is no}} metamorphosis; instead, the animal grows {{through a series of}} moults, with each moult adding various numbers of {{segments}} to the body, but without any dramatic changes in form.

25|$|Copepods are a {{group of}} small {{crustaceans}} found in ocean and freshwater habitats. Many species are planktonic (drifting in the ocean water), while others are benthic (living on the sea floor). Copepods are typically one millimetre (0.04in) to two millimetres (0.08in) long, with a teardrop shaped body. Like <b>other</b> <b>crustaceans</b> they have an armoured exoskeleton, but they are so small that this armour, and the entire body, is usually transparent.|$|E
25|$|As with <b>other</b> <b>crustaceans,</b> copepods have a larval form. For copepods, the egg hatches into a nauplius form, with a {{head and}} a tail but no true thorax or abdomen. The larva molts several times until it resembles the adult and then, after more molts, {{achieves}} adult development. The nauplius form is {{so different from the}} adult form that it was once thought to be a separate species.|$|E
25|$|Each {{compound}} eye {{is made up}} of up to {{ten thousand}} side-by-side ommatidia. Each eye consists of two flattened hemispheres separated by six parallel rows of specialised ommatidia, collectively called the midband. This divides the eye into three regions. This configuration enables mantis shrimp to see objects with three parts of the same eye. In other words, each eye possesses trinocular vision and therefore depth perception. The upper and lower hemispheres are used primarily for recognition of form and motion, like the eyes of many <b>other</b> <b>crustaceans.</b>|$|E

25|$|There is {{much more}} {{wildlife}} here than just the endangered Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris). Most importantly, mangroves are a transition from the marine to freshwater and terrestrial systems, and provide critical habitat for numerous species of small fish, crabs, shrimps and <b>other</b> <b>crustaceans</b> that adapt to feed and shelter, and reproduce among the tangled mass of roots, known as pneumatophores, which grow upward from the anaerobic mud to get the supply of oxygen. Fishing cats, macaques, wild boars, common grey mongooses, foxes, jungle cats, flying foxes, pangolins, and spotted deer are also found in abundance in the Sundarbans.|$|E
25|$|King {{penguins}} eat {{small fish}} and squid and rely less than most Southern Ocean predators on krill and <b>other</b> <b>crustaceans.</b> Fish constitute 80–100% of their diet, except in winter months of July and August, {{when they make}} up only 30%. Lanternfish are the main fish taken, principally the species Electrona carlsbergi and Krefftichthys anderssoni, as well as Protomyctophum tenisoni. Slender escolar (Paradiplospinus gracilis) of the Gempylidae, and Champsocephalus gunneri, is also consumed. Cephalopods consumed include those of the genus Moroteuthis, the hooked squid or Kondakovia longimana, the sevenstar flying squid (Martialia hyadesii), young Gonatus antarcticus and Onychoteuthis species.|$|E
25|$|Capelin are a {{forage fish}} of the smelt family {{found in the}} Atlantic and Arctic oceans. In summer, they graze on dense swarms of {{plankton}} {{at the edge of}} the ice shelf. Larger capelin also eat krill and <b>other</b> <b>crustaceans.</b> The capelin move inshore in large schools to spawn and migrate in spring and summer to feed in plankton rich areas between Iceland, Greenland, and Jan Mayen. The migration is affected by ocean currents. Around Iceland maturing capelin make large northward feeding migrations in spring and summer. The return migration takes place in September to November. The spawning migration starts north of Iceland in December or January.|$|E

As of 2007, 17 species of Caridina, 22 species of Macrobrachium and 6 species of Holthuisana (formerly included in Austrothelphusa) are known from New Guinea. <b>Other</b> <b>crustacean</b> genera known from New Guinea freshwater are Atya (2 species) and Palaemon (2) shrimps, and Geelvinkia (3), Halicarcinus (1), Pseudograpsus (1), Ptychognathus (1), Rouxana (5) and Varuna (1) crabs.|$|R
25|$|The longnose {{trevally}} is an epibenthic predator, taking prey {{from the}} seafloor or just above it, {{with only one}} study ever to thoroughly record its diet, which {{was carried out in}} the Gulf of Carpentaria of Australia. Here it was found its main prey were small fish, with considerable quantities of molluscs, brachyurans, and <b>other</b> <b>crustaceans</b> also taken. In South Africa, the species is thought to prefer prawns as its major dietary component, with crabs and small fish also taken. The longnose trevally has a fairly soft mouth, which may partly determine its diet. Very little is known of reproduction in the species, although juveniles have been recorded from shallow coastal bays.|$|E
25|$|Lobsters are omnivores and {{typically}} eat live prey such as fish, mollusks, <b>other</b> <b>crustaceans,</b> worms, and some plant life. They scavenge if necessary, and {{are known to}} resort to cannibalism in captivity. However, when lobster skin is found in lobster stomachs, {{this is not necessarily}} evidence of cannibalism – lobsters eat their shed skin after moulting. While cannibalism was thought to be nonexistent among wild lobster populations, it was observed in 2012 by researchers studying wild lobsters in Maine. These first known instances of lobster cannibalism in the wild are theorized to be attributed to a local population explosion among lobsters caused by the disappearance of many of the Maine lobsters' natural predators.|$|E
25|$|Free-living {{barnacles}} {{are attached}} to the substratum by cement glands that form the base of the first pair of antennae; in effect, the animal is fixed upside down by means of its forehead. In some barnacles, the cement glands are fixed to a long, muscular stalk, but in most {{they are part of a}} flat membrane or calcified plate. A ring of plates surrounds the body, homologous with the carapace of <b>other</b> <b>crustaceans.</b> These consist of the rostrum, two lateral plates, two carinolaterals, and a carina. In sessile barnacles, the apex of the ring of plates is covered by an , which may be recessed into the carapace.
