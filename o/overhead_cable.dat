2500|$|Up to 500 bombs {{weighting}} 250/450/1000 kgs {{were dropped}} on the target. Three bombs hit {{the upper part of}} the dam, one hit the part of the turbine room which had been already destroyed, and up to 50 hit the previously destroyed [...] transformer facility. The remaining bombs missed the target by 1-2 km to the southeast. [...] In addition to high-explosive bombs, the enemy used incendiary and napalm bombs. The dam, the working turbines, the generators and the transformers were not damaged. The shock waves destroyed a high-voltage <b>overhead</b> <b>cable</b> and six peasant huts. The warehouse storing the POW’s food burned down. One local man was killed and two were wounded.|$|E

2500|$|The term [...] "trolley" [...] predates the {{invention}} of the trolley pole. The earliest electric cars did not use a pole, but rather a system in which each tramcar dragged behind it an <b>overhead</b> <b>cable</b> connected to a small cart – or [...] "troller" [...] – [...] that rode on a [...] "track" [...] of overhead wires. From the side, the dragging lines made the car seem to be [...] "trolling", as in fishing. If the troller cart were to derail from the overhead wire, it would fall with a loud crash onto the roof of the tramcar and be troublesome to reposition; these drawbacks prompted a search for better ways to connect to the power wire. Later, when a pivoted pole replaced the troller, it {{came to be known as}} a [...] "trolley pole".|$|E
2500|$|During {{the early}} years of its existence, prior to the opening of the fourth canal, {{navigation}} was only possible to {{the east side of the}} bridge. Electrical power to operate the bridge was supplied via an <b>overhead</b> <b>cable</b> from the west shore. [...] With the opening of the fourth canal, there was navigable water on both sides making an overhead wire impossible. [...] Since the bridge was designed to have the power fed from overhead and not beneath, an underwater cable was run from the shore to the more northerly concrete fender (which protected the ends of the bridge from ships when it swung). [...] A pole was erected on each [...] fender, and a guy wire run between them directly over the bridge. [...] The power cable was suspended from this guy wire to reach the top-hat-shaped device in the middle of the bridge which transferred the power to the rotating bridge. [...] This top-hat, and the two poles on the fenders, are still visible today. [...] This is a relatively unusual method of providing power to a swing bridge.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} {{experiments}} were tried {{out over the}} next few decades in an attempt to find a better method than horses or mules for propulsion of streetcars. [...] These included an <b>overhead</b> <b>cable</b> car system (an underground cable, such as was eventually developed in San Francisco, was impossible because of the high water table under New Orleans); a walking beam system; peneumatic propulsion; an ammonia locomotive; a [...] "Thermo-specific" [...] system using super-heated water; and the Lamm Fireless engine. [...] Lamm engines were actually adopted and used for a time on the New Orleans and Carrollton line, which had previously used steam locomotives. [...] That line gradually gave up steam locomotives because of the objections of residents along the line to the smoke, soot, and noise. The area between the town of Carrollton and the City of New Orleans was sparsely populated with large swaths of agricultural land when the line was laid out in the 1830s; by the latter 19th century it was almost completely urbanized. [...] Carrollton was annexed to New Orleans in 1874. [...] Due to this increased urbanization, horsecars were used on the entire line.|$|E

2500|$|Once {{out of the}} quarry, a {{block was}} moved to a loading station for {{transport}} to the mill site. [...] The first method (1906 through 1909) used the 50-ton electric hoist, which lowered the block down and onto a Pea Vine cable-powered cart. The cart then moved on rails with downgrades to 54% to a loading station where the block was transferred to a wagon for towing to the mill site. [...] The wagons were first towed by teams of four horses then in 1908 by a 110-horsepower steam tractor previously used for logging. [...] The road to the mill site {{was built in the}} 1890s by John Osgood to his quarry, which was just below the CYMC started quarry. [...] By 1910, the method changed with the 50-ton hoist attaching a block to an <b>overhead</b> <b>cable</b> for lowering [...] to a new loading station. [...] Here the block was placed on a flatcar for towing by an electric tram (designed by General Electric) on standard-gauge railroad track to the town of Marble and into the mill site. [...] Electricity to power the tram came from the CYMC-built hydro-electric plant located just east of the town.|$|E
2500|$|Lauffen am Neckar was {{the birthplace}} of {{alternating}} current transmission. For the International Electro-Technical Exhibition - 1891 in Frankfurt am Main, Dolivo-Dobrowolsky and Oskar von Miller constructed a three-phase high-voltage transmission line which came into operation on 24 August 1891. [...] For this, a three-phase alternator made by Maschinenfabrik Oerlikon was installed in the cement works at Lauffen, with an <b>overhead</b> <b>cable</b> to carry the current under 15 kV to Frankfurt – a distance of [...] [...] The entrance to the exhibition was lit with 1000 light bulbs and the middle section surmounted by an arch bearing the inscription “Power Transmission Lauffen – Frankfurt 175 km”. [...] At the same time, an artificial waterfall some 6 m high was powered by electric current. [...] At {{the close of the}} exhibition, transmission of current from the Lauffen three-phase alternator was maintained to Heilbronn, which thus became the first town in the world to receive a regular supply of electricity from a remote location. [...] To this day, the name of the local electricity utility, ZEAG (Zementwerk Lauffen – Elektrizitätswerk Heilbronn AG), is a reminder of this achievement.|$|E

25|$|The Nord-Sud company {{lines were}} powered through <b>overhead</b> <b>cables,</b> whereas the third rail system was in {{use on the}} CMP's network. With the {{ownership}} transition, the CMP standard was adopted on the lines 12 and 13. As a result, the <b>overhead</b> <b>cables</b> of the Nord-Sud were decommissioned in 1932, one year after those of line 13. Pantographs continued {{to be used in}} the Vaugirard workshop. To improve the connection of the lines and facilitate the transfer of the carriages, a new link was built in 1935, between the Montparnasse station and the Vavin station of line 4.|$|R
