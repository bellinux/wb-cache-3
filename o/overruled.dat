40|$|Over {{the last}} few years – and {{especially}} following the 2006 Term – commentators have criticized the Supreme Court for engaging in “stealth <b>overruling.</b> ” This article examines the phenomenon, trying to ascertain why the justices engage in the practice and how we should feel about it. The article focuses on the gradual <b>overruling</b> of Miranda v. Arizona, because here tangible evidence is available about the benefit to the justices – and costs {{to the rest of us}} – of the practice of stealth <b>overruling.</b> The article demonstrates that by engaging in stealth <b>overruling</b> the justices are able to see that their will is done by lower courts and public officials, yet avoid any negative effect from public opinion. While the strategy benefits the justices, it has costs. Doctrine is rendered incoherent, and public officials are encouraged to evade federal law. Of greatest concern, stealth <b>overruling</b> tempers the dialogue between the Court and the public about the proper meaning of the Constitution, leaving the course of constitutional law solely in the justices’ hands...|$|R

After {{a four-day}} jury trial in Lexington, Kentucky, that ended on December 7, 2009, the estate and daughters of 39‑year‑old Bryan Woodward were awarded compensatory damages in the amount of $7.1million. While Comair challenged this verdict as excessive, on April 2, 2010, Judge Forester <b>overruled</b> Comair's objections and upheld the verdict.|$|E
5|$|Fingleton nearly {{failed to}} make the trip. His {{newspaper}} editor Eric Baume ordered to write a column attacking the Australian Board of Control for vetoing players from going on a private tour of India, threatening to sack him if he refused—criticism of the board typically resulted in exclusion from selection. Fingleton was reluctant to comply, and was reprieved when the editor-in-chief <b>overruled</b> Baume.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{issuance}} of the Churchill White Paper in June 1922, the House of Lords rejected a Palestine Mandate that incorporated the Balfour Declaration by 60 votes to 25, following a motion issued by Lord Islington.

5|$|Winter {{sports have}} {{traditionally}} been second to summer pursuits in Australian sporting culture, but interest and support in the former has grown.

5|$|Although {{the case}} has not been {{formally}} <b>overruled,</b> two Supreme Court decisions in the 1970s and 1980s have undone its effect by ruling that there is federal subject-matter jurisdiction for a federal common law cause of action for recovering possession based on the common-law doctrine of aboriginal title. Moreover, the New York courts' interpretation of the Nonintercourse Act is no longer good law. Modern federal courts hold that only Congress can ratify a conveyance of aboriginal title, and only with a clear statement, rather than implicitly.|$|E
5|$|Diocletian was in Antioch in {{the autumn}} of 302, when the next {{instance}} of persecution occurred. The deacon Romanus visited a court while preliminary sacrifices were taking place and interrupted the ceremonies, denouncing the act in a loud voice. He was arrested and sentenced to be set aflame, but Diocletian <b>overruled</b> the decision, and decided that Romanus should have his tongue removed instead. Romanus would be executed on November 18, 303. The boldness of this Christian displeased Diocletian, and he left the city and made for Nicomedia to spend the winter, accompanied by Galerius.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{efforts have been}} made to <b>overrule</b> the General Electric case. These culminated in the Line Material {{decision}} where no majority of the Supreme Court could be obtained either to affirm or <b>overrule</b> General Electric. We are not unmindful of this decision nor the vigorous dissent of four justices in favor of <b>overruling</b> General Electric. We think, however, that in the absence of horizontal agreement among licensees, or any plan aimed at or resulting in industry wide price fixing, licenses with price fixing provisions fall within the orbit of the patent and need not run afoul of the antitrust laws.|$|R

The case, which invoked the 21st Amendment, was appealed and attached to another case. The case reached the Supreme Court later on as Swedenburg v. Kelly and was <b>overruled</b> in a 5–4 decision that found the law was discriminatory and unconstitutional.|$|E
5|$|In August 2012, Weird Tales became {{involved}} in a media altercation after the editor announced the magazine was going to publish an excerpt from Victoria Foyt's controversial novel Save the Pearls, which many critics accused of featuring racist stereotyping. The decision was made despite the protests of VanderMeer, and prompted her to end her association with the magazine. The publisher subsequently <b>overruled</b> the editor, and announced that Weird Tales no longer had plans to run the excerpt.|$|E
5|$|In December 2007, DoD {{officials}} {{met with}} the White House Military Office to discuss the program's future; the Pentagon had apparently wanted to terminate the VH-71 due to setbacks, budget issues, and design problems.

In July 2008, the VH-71A (also called Increment 1) was to reach operating capability in 2010.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the evolution of}} common law under <b>overruling,</b> a system of precedent change in which appellate courts replace existing legal rules with new ones. We use a legal realist model, in which judges change the law to reflect their own preferences or attitudes, but changing the law is costly to them. The model’s predictions {{are consistent with the}} empirical evidence on the <b>overruling</b> behavior of the U. S. Supreme Court and appellate courts. We find that <b>overruling</b> leads to unstable legal rules that rarely converge to efficiency. The selection of disputes for litigation does not change this conclusion. These pessimistic results contrast with the findings of Gennaioli and Shleifer (2007) that the law– making strategy of distinguishing has beneficial evolutionary properties. Our findings provide a rationale for the value of precedent, {{as well as for the}} general preference of appellate courts for distinguishing rather than <b>overruling</b> as a law-making strategy...|$|R
