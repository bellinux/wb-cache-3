5|$|Vorazun is a Nerazim matriarch, {{daughter}} to Raszagal, second-in-command to Artanis, {{and the leader}} of the surviving Nerazim on Shakuras. She is a skilled warrior, and dedicated to her people. Vorazun is deeply committed to the individuality and culture <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>people.</b> While she originally feared the cultural change the Daelaam was bringing to her people, she nonetheless remained committed to its ideals in a unified protoss nation.|$|E
5|$|Tubman's {{friends and}} {{supporters}} {{from the days}} of abolition, meanwhile, raised funds to support her. One admirer, Sarah Hopkins Bradford, wrote an authorized biography entitled Scenes in the Life of Harriet Tubman. The 132-page volume was published in 1869, and brought Tubman some US$1,200 in revenue. Criticized by modern biographers for its artistic license and highly subjective point of view, the book nevertheless remains an important source of information and perspective on Tubman's life. Bradford released another volume in 1886 called Harriet, the Moses <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>People,</b> which presented a less caustic view of slavery and the South. It, too, was published as a way to help alleviate Tubman's poverty.|$|E

5|$|Liliʻuokalani helped {{preserve}} {{key elements}} of Hawaii's traditional poetics while mixing in Western harmonies brought by the missionaries. A compilation of her works, titled The Queen's Songbook, was published in 1999 by the Queen Liliʻuokalani Trust. Liliʻuokalani used her musical compositions {{as a way to}} express her feelings for her people, her country, and {{what was happening in the}} political realm in Hawaii. One example of the way her music reflected her political views is her translation of the Kumulipo, the Hawaiian creation chant. While under house arrest, Liliʻuokalani feared she would never leave the palace alive, so she translated the Kumulipo in hopes that the history and culture <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>people</b> would never be lost. The ancient chants record her family's genealogy back to the origin story of Hawaii.|$|E

25|$|It {{is against}} this {{backdrop}} that {{the first of a}} long series of portraits appears depicting Elizabeth with heavy symbolic overlays of imperial dominion based on mastery of the seas. Combined with a second layer of symbolism representing Elizabeth as the Virgin Queen, these new paintings signify the manipulation of Elizabeth's image as the destined Protestant protector <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>people.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Pawnee are a matrilineal people. Ancestral descent is traced {{through the}} mother, and {{children}} are considered born into the mother's clan and are part <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>people.</b> Traditionally, a young couple moved into the bride's parents' lodge. People work together in collaborative ways, marked by both independence and cooperation, without coercion. Both women and men are active in political life, with independent decision-making responsibilities.|$|E

25|$|Marika {{understood}} the pressures {{placed on the}} Yolngu's small language group, called Yolŋu Matha, due to bauxite mining in the area, which commenced during the 20th century. She worked as a linguist to prevent the extinction <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>people's</b> indigenous languages. Pertaining to the languages <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own clan, Marika understood all fourteen languages of the Rirratjingu clan, and spoke three of these Rirratjingu languages fluently. She later helped to develop a traditional language curriculum for Yolngu children to preserve local languages.|$|R
25|$|Cally, {{played by}} Jan Chappell (series 1–3). Cally is an alien guerrilla fighter {{from the planet}} Auron. She is a telepath, like all <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>people,</b> who can {{transmit}} thoughts silently to others. She later develops mind-reading, telekinesis and precognition abilities, but is also uniquely vulnerable to telepathic control by alien forces. Cally develops as the moral conscience of the group, especially for later episodes of series 2 and throughout series 3.|$|E
25|$|She {{mentions}} Extinction <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>people</b> like {{a species}} wiped out. Then she gets more explicitly into the denouncing of colonialism and (specifically) Manifest Destiny. She directly ties the colonizers to today’s white America by calling them the skullmongers who are excavating the skulls {{of the dead}} Indians. Her poetry sarcastically talks about how the colonials thought they had {{earned the right to}} the land because they traveled over the sea. The Indians believed that the Americans should have come over bearing gifts, but instead came only talking of land and money.|$|E

She also hints that, despite the long-lasting exile <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>people,</b> Xebel's soldiers had been enemies of Black Manta himself from a distant time, even preceding the first public appearance of Aquaman, and states that, despite Mera's original mission being a solo one, Siren is now backed by the entire Death Squad, elite Xebel soldiers, at the orders of the acting princess. She later reveals that Siren is her younger sister.|$|E

The prince soon aids Elika in her quest to contain the dark god Ahriman in the Tree of Life {{at the center of}} the valley. They ultimately fail, but make every effort to lock Ahriman back into the tree. They succeed at this, but Elika dies. The prince, mirroring the actions of Elika's father which originally released Ahriman, decides to bring Elika back to life, freeing Ahriman once again. Ahriman chases them to an underground palace, where Elika ultimately abandons the prince in search <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>people.</b>|$|E
500|$|In April 1917, Liliʻuokalani {{raised the}} American flag at Washington Place {{in honor of}} five Hawaiian sailors who had perished in {{the sinking of the}} SS Aztec by German U-boats. Her act was {{interpreted}} by many as her symbolic support of the United States. Subsequent, historians like Neil Thomas Proto have disputed the true meaning of her act. Proto argued that [...] "er gesture that day was intended to reflect the dignity with which she still held the right <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>people</b> to choose their own fate long after she was gone".|$|E
500|$|Hong Kong's current {{structure}} of governance inherits from the British model of colonial administration {{set up in}} the 1850s. The 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration states that [...] "Hong Kong should enjoy a high degree of autonomy in all areas except defence and foreign affairs" [...] with reference to the underlying principle of one country, two systems. This Declaration stipulates that Hong Kong maintains her capitalist economic system and guarantees the rights and freedoms <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>people</b> for at least 50 years after the 1997 handover. [...] Such guarantees are enshrined in the Hong Kong's Basic Law, the territory's constitutional document, which outlines the system of governance after 1997, albeit subject to interpretation by China's Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC).|$|E

Its powers extended to areas not previously under its purview, such as defence and foreign policy. This situation remained throughout merger with Malaysia in 1963, and after separation from Malaysia and full independence in 1965. In the Proclamation of Singapore contained in the Independence of Singapore Agreement 1965 entered into between Malaysia and Singapore, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew proclaimed {{on behalf of the}} people and Government of Singapore that as from 9 August 1965 Singapore [...] "shall be forever a sovereign democratic and independent nation, founded upon the principles of liberty and justice and ever seeking the welfare and happiness <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>people</b> in a more just and equal society".|$|E
500|$|Alice and Louis's {{return to}} Darmstadt as Grand Duke and Duchess {{was met with}} celebration that Alice did not expect. However, she found her duties overwhelming, writing to her mother that she [...] "dreaded everything". Alice used her new role to reform the social {{conditions}} of Darmstadt, but found the responsibility of being Landesmutter (mother <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>people)</b> strenuous. In another letter to her mother, she wrote that her duties were [...] "more than she could stand in the long run". She was distressed by a rumour that she was once unkind to Louis's aunt, Grand Duchess Mathilde Caroline, and she was hurt by an unkind letter from Queen Victoria. Alice complained to Louis that the letter [...] "made me cry with anger...I wish I were dead and it probably will not be too long before I give Mama that pleasure." [...] However, no mention is made of what provoked this angry outburst.|$|E

[...] After a military parade consisting of thousands of troops led by General J. Franklin Bell passed the statue and the reviewing stands, the main speech by Roosevelt was given. [...] Roosevelt's remarks, which covered various topics including war, peace, national pride and family, included the following: [...] "Modern statuary has added a new terror to death. But I wish on behalf of those who live in the capital of the nation to express my very profound acknowledgment to those who had the good taste to choose a great sculptor to do this work. I thank them for having erected here in so well a chosen site a statue which, {{not only because of the}} man it commemorates, but because of its intrinsic worth, adds to the nobility and beauty of the capital city of the country." [...] Following the president's remarks, an overture from Semiramide, [...] "On the Field of Glory", was played. [...] General Oliver O. Howard then spoke about his interactions with McClellan and General Grenville M. Dodge read a letter from General Daniel Sickles (who was ill at the time) that discussed his personal experiences with McClellan [...] General Dwight's speech included the statement: [...] "Statues may crumble to dust. Veterans' graves will be obliterated by time, but the grandest monument of the service of valor of the soldiers and sailors of the Civil War, the United States of America, the hope and joy of the world, consecrated to liberty by the blood and treasure of the nation, the undying testimonial of the patriotism <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>people,</b> will continue years and years."
