40|$|To {{what extent}} do <b>older</b> <b>Americans</b> {{re-enter}} the labor force after an initial exit and what drives these “unretirement” decisions? Retirement for most <b>older</b> <b>Americans</b> with full-time career jobs is not a one-time, permanent event. Labor force exit {{is more likely to}} be a process. Prior studies have found that between one half and two thirds of career workers take at least one other job before exiting from the labor force completely. The transitional nature of retirement may be even more pronounced when considering the impact of re-entry. This paper examines the extent to which <b>older</b> <b>Americans</b> with career jobs re-entered the labor force. The analysis is based on data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), an ongoing, longitudinal survey of <b>older</b> <b>Americans</b> that began in 1992. We examined the retirement patterns of a subset of 5, 617 HRS respondents who were on a full-time career job at the time of the first interview. Logistic regression was used to explore determinants of re-entry among those who initially exited the labor force. We found that approximately 15 percent of <b>older</b> <b>Americans</b> with career jobs returned to the labor force after initially exiting. Respondents were more likely to re-enter if they were younger, were in better health, or had a defined-contribution pension plan. This research provides empirical evidence of how <b>older</b> <b>Americans</b> are utilizing bridge jobs as they transition from career employment, and that re-entry may be an important part of the work experience of <b>older</b> <b>Americans.</b> Economics of Aging, Partial Retirement, Bridge Jobs, Gradual Retirement...|$|R

The Korean researcher’s auto-biographical journal, a coding scheme, peer debriefing, and thick description with quotes were utilized to ensure the trustworthiness of study findings. Participants described the meaning of driving throughout their lifespan as having four themes: Starting to be autonomous, Staying autonomous, Losing autonomy, and Regaining autonomy.

500|$|... "Old John Robertson", {{which had}} already been issued some six months earlier as the B-side of the [...] "Lady Friend" [...] single, was another country-tinged song that {{looked forward to the}} band's future country rock experimentation. The song was {{inspired}} by a retired film director who lived in the small town near San Diego where Hillman grew up. John S. Robertson was something of an eccentric figure around the town, regularly wearing a Stetson hat and sporting a white handlebar moustache, which gave him the appearance of a character out of the <b>old</b> <b>American</b> West. In the song, Hillman recalls the children of the town and their cruel laughter at this colorful figure, as well as the combination of awe and fear that he elicited in the townsfolk. During the recording of the song, Crosby switched instruments with Hillman to play bass instead of his usual rhythm guitar. The track also makes liberal use of the studio effects known as phasing and flanging, particularly during the song's orchestral middle section and subsequent verse. The version of [...] "Old John Robertson" [...] found on the B-side of the [...] "Lady Friend" [...] single is a substantially different mix from the version that appears on The Notorious Byrd Brothers album.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{explored}} {{the role of}} various chronic conditions in explaining recent improvements in functioning among <b>older</b> <b>Americans.</b> METHODS: We used the Supplements on Aging to the 1984 and 1994 National Health Interview Surveys to examine changes among Americans 70 years and older in reports of chronic conditions and functional limitations. We decomposed functioning changes into condition-related components, controlling for demographic shifts. RESULTS: The percentage of <b>older</b> <b>Americans</b> with upper- and lower-body limitations declined from 5. 1 % and 34. 2 %, respectively, in 1984 to 4. 3 % and 28. 5 % in 1995, and {{the average number of}} lower body limitations decreased. During the same period, reports of 8 of 9 chronic conditions increased, but many of these conditions had less debilitating effects on functioning. Reductions in the debilitating effects of various chronic conditions [...] particularly arthritis [...] are important in explaining declines in limitations experienced by <b>older</b> <b>Americans.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Earlier diagnosis and improved treatment and management of chronic conditions, rather than prevention, may be important contributing factors to improvements in upper- and lower-body functioning among <b>older</b> <b>Americans...</b>|$|R
