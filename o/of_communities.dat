40|$|This study {{examined}} the strength {{and nature of the}} sense <b>of</b> <b>community</b> in a small New Zealand primary school learning community. The research used a mixed methods approach to examine individual and group-level predictors and characteristics <b>of</b> sense <b>of</b> <b>community</b> among parents, students and staff. The strength <b>of</b> sense <b>of</b> <b>community</b> was assessed through the Brief Sense <b>of</b> <b>Community</b> Index (BSCS) while further understanding of the sense <b>of</b> <b>community</b> was gained through analysis of qualitative data according to McMillan and Chavis' (1986) four dimensions <b>of</b> sense <b>of</b> <b>community.</b> Factors identified as enabling sense <b>of</b> <b>community</b> were: acceptance and belonging, shared understandings of and commitment to parent volunteering, positive experiences of adult induction, being heard, shared norms or guiding principles, pride in the community, shared values and goals, reciprocal support, friendship, personal development, shared history, and sharing experiences. The study revealed a difference in the sense <b>of</b> <b>community</b> between students and adults in the school, with students having a higher sense <b>of</b> <b>community.</b> Parents with more children in the school had a significantly higher sense <b>of</b> <b>community</b> than parents with fewer children enrolled in the school. Data showed small negative correlations between sense <b>of</b> <b>community</b> and being in the Synergy building, and also between sense <b>of</b> <b>community</b> and frequency <b>of</b> contact between Synergy community members.

The revolt rapidly spread through the dominion, and the New England colonies quickly restored their pre-dominion governments. When news of the Boston revolt reached New York a week later, Nicholson took no steps to announce news of it, or of the revolution in England, for fear of raising prospects of rebellion in New York. When word of the Boston revolt reached Long Island, politicians and militia leaders became more assertive, and by mid-May dominion officials had been ousted from a number <b>of</b> <b>communities.</b> At the same time, Nicholson learned that France had declared war on England, bringing the threat of French and Indian attacks on New York's northern frontier.

5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the ninth}} century Alfred the Great started to revive {{learning}} and monasticism, and this work was carried on by his grandson, King Æthelstan (924–939). Kings before Edgar (959–975) did not take the view, which was adopted by Æthelwold and his circle, that the only worthwhile religious life was Benedictine monasticism. When Gérard of Brogne reformed the Abbey of Saint Bertin in Saint-Omer in 944, dissident monks found a refuge in England under King Edmund (939–946). Before the tenth-century reform, the lines between secular clergy and monastics were sometimes blurred.

5|$|Bees may be solitary or {{may live}} in various types <b>of</b> <b>communities.</b> Sociality, of several {{different}} types, {{appears to have}} evolved independently many times within the bees. The most advanced of these are species with eusocial colonies; these are characterised by having cooperative brood care and a division of labour into reproductive and non-reproductive adults, plus overlapping generations. This division of labour creates specialized groups within eusocial societies which are called castes. In some species, groups of cohabiting females may be sisters, {{and if there is}} a division of labour within the group, they are considered semisocial. The group is called eusocial if, in addition, the group consists of a mother (the queen) and her daughters (workers). When the castes are purely behavioural alternatives, with no morphological differentiation other than size, the system is considered primitively eusocial, as in many paper wasps; when the castes are morphologically discrete, the system is considered highly eusocial.|$|E

Many studies have explored the significance <b>of</b> sense <b>of</b> <b>community</b> and collaborative learning activities in an online learning environment. The aim of this study, however, was to find a relationship between student attitude toward online collaborative learning and their sense <b>of</b> <b>community</b> in an online environment. Using a correlational study, the relationship between students 2 ̆ 7 sense <b>of</b> <b>community</b> and their attitude toward online collaborative learning was determined. Collaboration and sense <b>of</b> <b>community</b> were moderately correlated, whereas, Pearson 2 ̆ 7 s product-moment correlational coefficient was, r(198) = 0. 672, p 3 ̆c 0. 01. As collaboration increased, students 2 ̆ 7 sense <b>of</b> <b>community</b> increased proportionally. Moreover, it was also noticed that the degree of correlation between sense <b>of</b> <b>community</b> and collaborative learning was higher among graduate students when compared to that of undergraduate students. Furthermore, a higher degree of correlation also existed between a positive attitude towards collaborative learning and the dimensions <b>of</b> sense <b>of</b> <b>community</b> when compared to that between a negative attitude towards collaborative learning and sense <b>of</b> <b>community.</b> The findings in this study will aid educators and instructional designers to rethink the design of their online courses to incorporate elements of collaborative learning and strategies to develop a sense <b>of</b> <b>community,</b> which, in turn will help in increasing the learner satisfaction and learning outcomes in such courses...|$|R

Sense <b>of</b> <b>community</b> is a core dimension of well-being because the connections associated with sense <b>of</b> <b>community</b> are important for everyday life. The model in this study was developed to explore the effects <b>of</b> <b>community</b> connections (<b>community</b> capacity, ease <b>of</b> making connections, active participation in the community, and informal supports) and demographic variables on sense <b>of</b> <b>community.</b> A probability sample of 1, 499 adults 65 years and older that resided in rural areas responded to questions concerning their sense <b>of</b> <b>community</b> and community connections.

These findings suggest that key dimensions of aging (age, sex, health status) are less relevant when addressing sense <b>of</b> <b>community</b> when compared to associations and connections.
