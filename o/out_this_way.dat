25|$|In One Day Internationals, Rameez Raja (for Pakistan against England at Karachi in 1987) {{was given}} out for {{hitting the ball}} away with his bat to avoid being run out going for his century off the last ball of the innings, and Mohinder Amarnath (for India against Sri Lanka at Ahmedabad in 1989) was given out for kicking the ball away to avoid being run out. Another batsman to be given <b>out</b> <b>this</b> <b>way</b> is Inzamam-ul-Haq of Pakistan in the first ODI of India vs Pakistan Hutch Cup on 6 February 2006. After Inzamam drove the ball to mid off, Indian Suresh Raina threw {{it back to the}} striker's end, Inzamam {{stopping}} it with his bat. Umpire Simon Taufel gave him out as he was in the line of the stumps and out of his crease (and thus would have been run out had the ball hit the stumps).|$|E
500|$|Stardust {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} most publications, both on its original release {{and for its}} various reissues. Rolling Stone praised the album: [...] "For all the sleek sophistication of the material, Stardust is as down-home as the Legion dance. Heard coast to coast in lounges and on elevator soundtracks, these tunes {{have become part of}} the folk music of exurban America. And that's the way Nelson plays them—spare and simple, with a jump band's verve and a storyteller's love of a good tale. By offering these songs, he's displaying the tools of a journeyman musician's trade—worn smooth and polished by constant use—and when he lays them <b>out</b> <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> they kind of look like works of art. Willie Nelson may be acknowledging both his own and country music's debt to Broadway and Tin Pan Alley, but he's also showing these hallowed musical institutions how the country makes their music its own".|$|E

500|$|Brown {{returned}} to first-class cricket in 1947–48, scoring 192 runs at 38.40 {{in the first}} three matches of the season. The season saw an Indian tour of Australia. The selectors initially dropped Barnes to pair Brown with Morris to open the batting. Apart from two Tests during the 1936–37 season against England, Brown had not played Test cricket on Australian soil. He had only one opportunity with the bat in the First Test in Brisbane, making 11 as India fell to an innings defeat. It was to be his only innings and Test match on his home ground. Brown's participation in the series was overshadowed by his controversial run out by Indian left arm orthodox spinner Vinoo Mankad in the Second Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground in December 1947. Brown was run out for 18, when in the act of delivering the ball, Mankad held on to it and whipped the bails off at the non-striker's end. Brown was well out of his crease while he was backing-up the striker, so that he could get a head start in case he attempted a run. This was the second time during the season that Mankad had dismissed Brown in this fashion—as he had previously done so a match against an Australian XI in November. On that occasion, Mankad had warned Brown before running him out. The local press strongly accused Mankad of being unsportsmanlike, although some Australians—including Bradman—defended Mankad's actions. For his part, Brown took full blame and made light of the incident through humorous gestures in later matches, which referred to the event. After this incident, if a batsman is given <b>out</b> <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> he {{is said to have been}} [...] "Mankaded".|$|E
2500|$|Murray {{never played}} much {{basketball}} before the show, and was more into football while in high school. Because of this, a basketball coach was hired for Murray {{in order to}} improve his basketball skills. To go along with the character's personality, a [...] "sedate" [...] wardrobe was designed. Schwahn said of Lucas's wardrobe, [...] "...He was a Levi's guy. He was, you know, he wore a lot of, like, plain T-shirts and things because we just wanted him to represent the everyman." [...] Despite having the character start <b>out</b> <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> the series eventually let his wardrobe evolve. Starting from the fourth season on, he was given some [...] "wilder stuff". Schwahn clarified, [...] "You know, he can [...] rock something from Sean John, which normally would have been Nathan's department." [...] He said the style of the characters really does evolve on the show, especially with the four-year timeline jump. [...] "Diesel is so wonderful on [...] Diesel jeans. It's an Italian company. A lot of times, Italian designers cut much more slimly...for a really lean physique," [...] stated One Tree Hill's costume designer, Carol Cutshall. [...] "Also, this year, they’ve had nice long sleeves and nice long shirts and really slim clothing and that looks best on [...] He doesn’t need to be swallowed up. He's got his own style as a person. It's not just up to me. I try to bring in what I think is going to fit him best." [...] With the timeline jump, Lucas’s main brands become Diesel, Guess menswear, and Juicy Couture for men.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{controversy}} artist Mitch Clem published a six-part comic strip satirizing the events in his webcomic Nothing Nice to Say. He received an email from the album's producer Dave Gardener criticizing his satire of the situation: [...] "As the guy who recorded the record I have to say I found your attempt at social commentary via satire was pretty weak and actually fairly insulting. If you had any idea of the work that all of us, the band, the other guy who did the record and honestly the label put into making the record happen you might have an inkling over how shitty the leaking of the record is to us all." [...] Clem responded that the comic was actually intended to oppose music piracy, not to advocate it. Punknews.org editor Jesse Raub addressed the situation in his blog, stating that [...] "It sucks that Mr. Hale’s decision to share the album with his friends turned <b>out</b> <b>this</b> <b>way.</b> But he is directly responsible for the leak and needs to accept accountability for his actions. You can’t place the blame on everyone but you because they were forced to react to your initial actions." [...] Punknews.org posted a synopsis of the controversy, stating that [...] "Punknews.org does not support or condone leaking albums. It's not just about the commerce; {{there are many people who}} work on an album like this one, it is fair for people to at least be compensated for the time they took away from other jobs, families and friends in order to put together an album for you." ...|$|E

2500|$|In January 1926, the University of Kansas {{announced}} that it had hired Cappon as its new football coach. [...] Former Michigan football coach George Little, then at Wisconsin, recommended Cappon to the administrators at Kansas. [...] Little said {{he had tried to}} take Cappon with him to Wisconsin and called Cappon [...] "one of the most promising coaches of recent graduation in the United States." [...] On his first visit to Lawrence, Kansas, Cappon told reporters: [...] "I always have heard of the clean, fine sportsmanship in the Missouri Valley conference, and I am glad to be coming <b>out</b> <b>this</b> <b>way.</b> ... I hope we may turn out a football team that will be a credit to the Valley and in every way uphold Valley traditions for clean play and sportsmanship." [...] In two seasons as the football coach at Kansas, Cappon's record was 5–10–1. [...] According to a 1940 history of football at the University of Kansas, Cappon resigned after two years at Kansas {{as the result of a}} controversy over [...] "scouting." [...] The Missouri Valley conference schools had agreed [...] "not to 'scout' each other in the belief that such a practice was unsportsmanlike." [...] After Kansas beat Missouri 14–7 with a new passing attack and [...] "impregnable defense," [...] Missouri produced evidence to show that Kansas supporters, not part of the Kansas staff, had acted as [...] "volunteer scouts" [...] at Missouri games and had provided Cappon with [...] "charts of the Tiger plays," [...] that enabled Cappon to develop new schemes to stop the Missouri offense. [...] According to the 1940 account, the [...] "upshot of the affair was Cappon's resignation." ...|$|E
