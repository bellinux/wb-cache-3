5|$|Glee {{debuted in}} America on the Fox network on May19, 2009.

In the week prior to the broadcast of the pilot episode, Murphy stated that seven different companies had bid on {{the rights to the}} series' first soundtrack. The contenders were narrowed down to four labels, with Fox ultimately signing a deal with Columbia Records as a result <b>of</b> <b>chairman</b> Rob Stringer's belief that Glee would be a success. Stringer appreciated the series' use of both classic and contemporary pop music. He suggested that other record labels underestimated the potential of Glee musical releases as they are all cover versions.|$|E

5|$|In 1873 Reitz {{was asked}} to {{represent}} the district of Beaufort West in the Cape Parliament. The day he took his seat, 30 May, his father, who was the representative for Swellendam, announced his retirement from the Assembly.

Only two months later, President Johannes Brand of the Orange Free State offered Reitz the position <b>of</b> <b>chairman</b> of the newly formed Appellate Court of the Orange Free State, {{despite the fact that}} Reitz was not fully qualified (inter alia too young). Reitz refused the offer for this reason, but when another candidate also refused, Brand insisted on the nomination of Reitz, and convinced the Volksraad to appoint him.|$|E

5|$|Kent vs Lancashire at Canterbury is an oil {{on canvas}} {{painting}} by Albert Chevallier Tayler completed in 1907. It was commissioned by the Kent County Cricket Club at the suggestion <b>of</b> <b>chairman</b> Lord Harris to celebrate their first County Championship title win. Tayler painted the picture after taking individual sittings {{with each of the}} Kent players. With the exception of short-term loans, the painting remained at the St Lawrence Ground until 1999, at which time it was moved to the Lord's Pavilion as the Kent Club could no longer afford the insurance. In 2006, Kent sold the painting to a charity foundation at an auction. The piece is currently on display at Lord's Cricket Ground in London.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} intellectuals, Chen was imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution (1966–76).

He and Chen Baichen worked together for three years to make the historical film Da Feng Ge, based on the Han Dynasty palace intrigues of Empress Lü Zhi after the death of Emperor Gaozu. However, the film was again cancelled by high-ranking politicians, as it was reminiscent of the political struggles after the death <b>of</b> <b>Chairman</b> Mao Zedong.
