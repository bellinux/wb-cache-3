40|$|End-users {{are often}} {{perceived}} as the weakest link in information security. Because of this perception, {{a growing body of}} research and commercial activity is focused on automated approaches to security. With these approaches, security decisions are removed from the hands of the users, and are placed instead in systems themselves, or in remote services or organizations that establish policies that are automatically enforced. We contend that although security automation is potentially beneficial in theory, in practice it is not a panacea <b>for</b> <b>end-user</b> information security. A number of technical and social factors mitigate against the acceptance and efficacy of automated end-user security solutions in many cases. In this paper, we present a discussion of the inherent limitations of automating security <b>for</b> <b>end-users.</b> We then discuss a set of design guidelines for choosing whether to automate end-user security systems. We conclude with a set of research directions focused on increasing the acceptance and efficacy of security solutions <b>for</b> <b>end-users...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe World Wide Web {{has become}} an {{important}} platform for delivering services in the last decade. Openness and flexibility are indeed key factors {{for the success of}} the Web where end-users develop applications freely. As a consequence, end-users become producers and consumers of contents and services. <b>End-users</b> rely <b>for</b> their communication needs on communication platforms (CPs). CPs managed by Service Providers lack sufficient openness and flexibility for end users due to their own complexity. This paper examines the CPs from the perspective of openness and flexibility <b>for</b> <b>end-users,</b> and then proposes a novel concept, My Own Communication Service Provider (MOCSP). The key innovation is to provide an individual CP <b>for</b> an <b>end-user</b> <b>for</b> his/her communication services. To achieve this goal, we design a MOCSP system, based on a top-down and user-centric approach. Moreover, we analyse our approach in terms of benefits <b>for</b> <b>end-user...</b>|$|R

Metamorphic testing is very effective approach <b>for</b> <b>end-users</b> which also address the oracle problem. In this paper, a metamorphic testing approach for spreadsheet application is used effectively. Metamorphic testing is automated testing approach, which uses expected properties of the objective function to test program without human contribution. This approach defines a set of expected properties called Metamorphic Relations to detect errors in spreadsheet...|$|R
