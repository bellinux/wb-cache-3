However, critics argue that a trade-off between the environment and a need for food is not inevitable, and that pesticides simply replace good agronomic practices such as crop rotation. The UNEP introduces the Push–pull agricultural pest management technique which involves intercropping that uses plant aromas to repel or push away pests while pulling in or attracting the right insects. [...] "The implementation of push-pull in eastern Africa has significantly increased maize yields and the combined cultivation of N-fixing forage crops has enriched the soil and has also provided farmers with feed for livestock. With increased livestock operations, the farmers are able to produce meat, milk and other dairy products and they use the manure as <b>organic</b> <b>fertiliser</b> that returns nutrients to the fields." ...|$|E

40|$|Soil is the {{fundamental}} element in agriculture and is affected {{in a variety of}} ways. Besides other things, the long-term application of mineral and <b>organic</b> <b>fertilisers</b> can significantly influence the topsoil pool of nutrients, organic carbon content and pH. Within the scope of longterm field experiments in Praha-Ruzyně, we evaluated the effect of six fertiliser treatments - unfertilised Control, farmyard manure (FYM), cattle slurry (CAT), cattle slurry amended with straw from previous cereals (CAT+STR), mineral fertiliser (NPK) and NPK amended with FYM (NPK+FYM) on a topsoil pool of nutrient content, organic carbon content (Cox) and pH between the years 2001 and 2012. In the selected period, the fertiliser treatment did not influence the N and Cox content (ranging from 0. 126 % to 0. 143 %). Phosphorus and potassium were significantly higher in the NPK+FYM treatment (109. 82 and 279. 27 mg/kg, respectively), while calcium and magnesium were significantly lower in the NPK treatment (2, 973 and 134. 95 mg/kg, respectively). Application of mineral fertilisers significantly decreased the value of pH, influencing the Ca and Mg topsoil concentrations. <b>Organic</b> <b>fertilisers</b> cannot provide a sustainable amount of nutrients to generate high yields in a short time, but release their nutrients slowly and the range of nutrients is wider.

As she learned about organic fertilizers, she came in contact with Eliseo Cruiz, who had created a brand known as Plantmate. Her company, Wanda Organic imports <b>organic</b> <b>fertiliser</b> from the Philippines where it is cheaply produced.
