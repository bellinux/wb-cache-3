5|$|Historically, {{the largest}} ethnic group inhabiting the Zaolzie area was the Poles. During the 19th century the number <b>of</b> <b>Germans</b> grew. At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century and later from 1920 to 1938, the Czech population grew significantly (mainly as a result of immigration and the assimilation of locals) and the Poles became a minority, which they are to this day.|$|E

5|$|In 1939, Hitler and Mussolini {{resolved}} {{the problem of}} self-determination <b>of</b> <b>Germans</b> and maintaining the Brenner Pass frontier by an agreement in which German South Tyroleans were given the choice of either assimilation into Italian culture, or leave South Tyrol for Germany; most opted to leave for Germany.|$|E
5|$|In {{early morning}} of August 25, Lithuanians counterattacked and recaptured Sejny. Polish sources claim that Lithuanians there were {{aided by a}} company <b>of</b> <b>Germans</b> volunteers, but Lithuanian sources assert {{that it was an}} excuse used by Rudnicki to explain his defeat. The Lithuanian forces {{recovered}} some important documents and property, freed Lithuanian prisoners and, according to Mańczuk, executed several of the PMO fighters they found wounded.|$|E
5|$|The {{surge of}} German nationalism, {{stimulated by the}} {{experience}} <b>of</b> <b>Germans</b> in the Napoleonic period and initially allied with liberalism, shifted political, social, and cultural relationships within the German states. In this context, one can detect {{its roots in the}} experience <b>of</b> <b>Germans</b> in the Napoleonic period. The Burschenschaft student organizations and popular demonstrations, such as those held at Wartburg Castle in October 1817, contributed to a growing sense of unity among German speakers of Central Europe. Furthermore, implicit and sometimes explicit promises made during the War of Liberation engendered an expectation of popular sovereignty and widespread participation in the political process, promises that largely went unfulfilled once peace had been achieved. Agitation by student organizations led such conservative leaders as Klemens Wenzel, Prince von Metternich, to fear the rise of national sentiment; the assassination of German dramatist August von Kotzebue in March 1819 by a radical student seeking unification was followed on 20 September 1819 by the proclamation of the Carlsbad Decrees, which hampered intellectual leadership of the nationalist movement.|$|E

5|$|A {{reconnaissance}} patrol from the 13th Parachute Battalion reported a large gathering <b>of</b> <b>Germans</b> in Bréville and suspected an attack was imminent. At 08:00 a massive artillery and mortar bombardment fell along the 1st Special Service Brigade lines, while the 857th Grenadier Regiment, which had {{gathered in the}} village, attacked No. 6 Commando. By 10:30, the attack on No. 6 Commando had been driven back, but to their left at Hauger No.4 Commandos had to win a hand-to-hand fight before the Germans withdrew. Twice more during the day the commandos were attacked unsuccessfully, from Sallenelles {{in the north and}} again from Bréville.|$|E
5|$|After Mussolini {{had made}} clear in 1922 {{that he would}} never give up the region of South Tyrol from being in Italy, Hitler adopted this position. Hitler in Mein Kampf had {{declared}} that concerns over the rights <b>of</b> <b>Germans</b> in South Tyrol under Italian sovereignty was a non-issue considering the advantages that would be gained from a German-Italian alliance with Mussolini's Fascist regime. In Mein Kampf Hitler also made clear that he was opposed to having a war with Italy for the sake of obtaining South Tyrol. This position by Hitler of abandoning German land claims to South Tyrol produced aggravation among some NSDAP members who up to the late 1920s found it difficult to accept the position.|$|E
5|$|After the Mongol withdrawal, Béla IV {{abandoned}} his policy of recovering former crown lands. Instead, he granted large estates to his supporters, and {{urged them to}} construct stone-and-mortar castles. He initiated {{a new wave of}} colonization that resulted in the arrival of a number <b>of</b> <b>Germans,</b> Moravians, Poles, and Romanians. The king re-invited the Cumans and settled them in the plains along the Danube and the Tisza. A group of Alans, the ancestors of the Jassic people, seems to have settled in the kingdom around the same time.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the war, Europe {{had more}} than 40 million refugees, its economy had {{collapsed}} and 70 percent of its industrial infrastructure was destroyed. Between twelve and fourteen million ethnic Germans fled or were expelled from east-central Europe to Germany. During the Cold War, the West German government estimated a death toll of 2.2 million civilians due to the flight and expulsion <b>of</b> <b>Germans</b> and through forced labour in the Soviet Union. This figure remained unchallenged until the 1990s, when some historians put the death toll at 500,000–600,000 confirmed deaths. In 2006, the German government reaffirmed its position that 2.0–2.5 million deaths occurred.|$|E
5|$|Brigade Headquarters was {{attacked}} by a force <b>of</b> <b>Germans</b> that had infiltrated through the woods. Informed of the attack, Lieutenant Colonel Terence Otway, the commanding officer of 9th Parachute Battalion, collected 'C' Company, his own headquarters staff and a small group armed with captured German MG 42 machine-guns. They approached the Germans from the rear and trapped them in a crossfire, killing nineteen and capturing one. That afternoon two infantry platoons attacked 'A' Company, but were fought off by a counter-attack from 'C' Company's position.|$|E
5|$|During the {{subsequent}} Potsdam Conference in July–August 1945, {{the three major}} allied powers ratified the colossal westerly shift of Polish borders and approved its new territory between the Oder–Neisse line and Curzon Line. Following {{the destruction of the}} Polish-Jewish population in the Holocaust, the flight and expulsion <b>of</b> <b>Germans</b> in the west, resettlement of Ukrainians in the east, and the repatriation of Poles from Kresy, Poland became {{for the first time in}} its history an ethnically homogeneous nation-state without prominent minorities. The new government solidified its political power over the next two years, while the communist Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR) under Bolesław Bierut gained firm control over the country, which would become part of the postwar Soviet sphere of influence in Central and Eastern Europe.|$|E

5|$|Germany is {{the seventh}} most visited {{country in the}} world, {{with a total of}} 407 million {{overnights}} during 2012. This number includes 68.83 million nights by foreign visitors. In 2012, over 30.4 million international tourists arrived in Germany. Berlin has become the third most visited city destination in Europe. Additionally, more than 30% <b>of</b> <b>Germans</b> spend their holiday in their own country, with the biggest share going to Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Domestic and international travel and tourism combined directly contribute over EUR43.2 billion to German GDP. Including indirect and induced impacts, the industry contributes 4.5% of German GDP and supports 2 million jobs (4.8% of total employment).|$|E
5|$|In 1802, France sent {{most of the}} disgruntled legionnaires (two demi-brigades, 5,280 strong) to Haiti to {{put down}} the Haitian Revolution (on the Caribbean island of Haiti, known then as Saint Domingue, the French West Indies). Napoleon wanted to regain the colony of Saint Domingue, but {{preferred}} to save his main French army for more important matters, closer to home. The now inconvenient Polish units were accompanied by contingents <b>of</b> <b>Germans</b> and Swiss French allies, as well as by French units that had fallen out of favour with Napoleon and the French high command.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 09:00 that the 1st RUR were in {{position}} {{to carry out a}} left flanking attack on Longuerval. The village was clear <b>of</b> <b>Germans</b> so they pressed on towards Sainte-Honorine. When between the two villages, the battalion was engaged by German mortar, artillery and assault gun fire, and suffered several casualties. Two companies managed to reach Sainte-Honorine, but with no artillery fire support of their own, and out of radio contact with their battalion headquarters, they were forced to withdraw back to Longueval.|$|E

5|$|Later in the advance, Maxwell learnt from an English-speaking {{prisoner}} {{that a group}} <b>of</b> <b>Germans</b> in {{the adjacent}} post wished to surrender, but were afraid to give themselves up. Accompanied by two privates and the prisoner—who was {{to act as an}} interpreter—Maxwell approached the post. The three Australians, however, were immediately surrounded by a group of twenty German soldiers and disarmed. They seemed set to become prisoners themselves, before an artillery barrage fell on the position. Taking advantage of the resulting confusion, Maxwell pulled out a concealed revolver and shot two of the Germans before escaping with his men under heavy rifle fire; one of the privates was subsequently wounded. Organising a party of men, he immediately attacked and captured the post.|$|E
5|$|Later in the morning, No. 6 Commando {{came under}} {{artillery}} and mortar fire from Bréville. The commandos attacked and cleared the village <b>of</b> <b>Germans,</b> capturing several prisoners, some machine-guns and four artillery pieces. Then they withdrew {{to their original}} position. The Germans reoccupied the village and formed their own defensive positions, facing the ridge line defended by the airborne division. Their positions also isolated the 9th Parachute Battalion, which was almost {{cut off from the}} rest of the division.|$|E
5|$|Peter succeeded King Stephen I, {{who died}} on 15 August 1038, and adopted an active foreign policy. Hungarian troops plundered Bavaria in 1039 and 1040, and invaded Bohemia in 1040 to assist Duke Bretislav I against Holy Roman Emperor Henry III. Hungarian chronicles recount that Peter {{preferred}} the company <b>of</b> <b>Germans</b> ("who roared like wild beasts") and Italians ("who chattered and twittered like swallows"), which made him unpopular among his subjects. He introduced new taxes, seized Church revenue and deposed two bishops.|$|E
