Before the fens were drained, the {{harvesting}} of <b>osier</b> (<b>willow)</b> and sedge (rush) and the extraction of peat were important activities, as were eel fishing—from which the settlement's name may have been derived—and wild fowling. The city had been the centre of local pottery production for more than 700 years, including pottery known as Babylon ware. A Roman road, Akeman Street, passes through the city; the southern end is at Ermine Street near Wimpole and its northern end is at Brancaster. Little direct evidence of Roman occupation in Ely exists, although there are nearby Roman settlements such as those at Little Thetford and Stretham. A coach route, known to have existed in 1753 between Ely and Cambridge, was improved in 1769 as a turnpike (toll road). The present day A10 closely follows this route; a southwestern bypass {{of the city was}} built in 1986. Ely railway station built in 1845 is on the Fen Line and is now a railway hub, with lines north to King's Lynn, northwest to Peterborough, east to Norwich, southeast to Ipswich and south to Cambridge and London.|$|E

40|$|The {{paper is}} {{a review of}} {{classical}} and recent studies on willow rusts in Europe, with special reference to short rotation coppice willows used for biomass production, such as common <b>osier</b> <b>willow</b> (Salix viminalis L.). The review presents the taxo-nomic classification of rust fungi from the genus Melampsora spp. We present a list of telial hosts (genus Salix) as well as ae-cial hosts for different rust species. The life cycle of this fungal pathogen is described in detail from the epidemiological and genetic point of view. The DNA polymorphism of M. larici-epitea, the rust species most responsible for severe yield losses of plant biomass, is characterised based on RAPD, AFLP and RFLP-PCR methods.

40|$|Research of {{national}} specificity of phraseology {{in a national}} language by distinguishing thematic groups of phraseological units and the analysis of their component composition becomes increasingly important in linguistic studies. This article {{is devoted to the}} analysis of the French phraseological units, which include dendronyms. Authors narrow notion of “dendronym” and use it only to refer to the names of trees. In French phraseological corpus authors identified 18 dendronyms, which are core components of the floral phrasal units: amandier (almond tree), cèdre (cedar), chêne (oak), cocotier (coconut palm), cyprès (cypress), figuier (fig tree), laurier (laurel tree), mûrier (mulberry), olivier (olive tree), orme (elm), <b>osier</b> (<b>willow),</b> palmier (palm), peuplier (poplar), platane (sycamore), poirier (pear), pommier (apple), prunier (plum), sapin (spruce, fir). The following list proves that the repertoire of dendronyms used to form French FU is not too wide. However, the authors confirmed the possibility to consider idioms-dendronym component as special items of historical and cultural memory...|$|E

This paper {{presents}} {{dynamics of}} calorific value variations in wood grown in Lithuania {{that can be}} used for fuel, namely: Scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris), <b>osier</b> <b>willow</b> (Salix viminalis) and silver birch (Betula pendula). Felled wood with a moisture content of Pinus sylvestris – 42. 95 %, Salix viminalis – 43. 34 % and Betula pendula – 37. 82 % respectively, was stored in 3 variants of environmental conditions: on the ground, lifted above the ground and under a blow-off shelter. Purpose of the study – to analyse variations of moisture content in growing and felled wood, depending on the ambient air (weather) and storage conditions, influencing wood fuel production. To determine regularities of lower thermal energy variations in cut wood. Experimental trials had been conducted at the Department of Heat and Biotechnological Engineering, Lithuanian University of Agriculture. It was determined that moisture content and calorific value of wood stored outdoors depended on ambient air humidity and rainfall variations. Lower thermal energy value of wood stored under the blow-off shelter increased during spring period, and had always been approx. by 40. 55 % (4. 88 MJ·kg- 1) higher than that in open storage yards...|$|E
50|$|Between {{the dune}} ridges, {{directly}} behind the beach front dunes are shallow depressions called pannes. Because they are low spots, they can contain water {{most of the year}} and will be surrounded by grass and shrubs. Pannes are open and without a canopy layer. Around the edges is a dense shrub layer, often containing red <b>osier</b> dogwood, <b>willow,</b> and Kalm's St. John's wort. The herb layer, closest to the ground tends to be excellent cover through summer and fall. Included in this layer are twig rush, and lake shore rush, strawberry, mountain mint and others.|$|R
500|$|The slough {{watershed}} {{lies in the}} Portland/Vancouver Basin ecoregion, part of the Willamette Valley ecoregion {{designated by}} the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Black cottonwood, red <b>osier</b> dogwood, <b>willow,</b> Oregon white oak, and Oregon ash grow in scattered locations throughout the watershed, while wapato and Columbia sedge thrive in a few places. In the slough itself, macrophytes and algae sometimes restrict water flow and reduce water quality. Golf courses and athletic fields near the slough consist mainly of non-native grasses. [...] Developed plots with houses or businesses often have deciduous street trees, grasses, occasional conifers, {{and a variety of}} native and non-native shrubs. Invasive plants include Himalayan blackberry, English ivy, reed canarygrass, purple loosestrife, and Japanese knotweed.|$|R
50|$|Isleworth Ait {{was once}} a centre for the {{production}} of <b>osier</b> - a <b>willow</b> which used to be harvested on the island to weave baskets to carry fruit and vegetables grown in Middlesex to the markets in London. There used to be five neighbouring islands, but these have all disappeared over the centuries, some being destroyed by passing boat traffic. The River Crane flows into the Thames to the south of Isleworth Ait and the Duke of Northumberland's River at the northern end.|$|R
40|$|Rust (Melampsora spp.) is a {{damaging}} {{disease of}} willows (Salix spp.), including common osier (S. viminalis L.). So far, the pathogens {{of this species}} found in Europe were identified as M. larici-epitea Kleb. or M. ribesii-viminalis Kleb. Moreover, a stem infecting form (SIF), deprived of a sexual stage in its life cycle was reported. The {{aim of this study}} was to find out which species of the rust fungi cause disease symptoms on common osier in Poland. The isolates from common osier were compared to the ones originating from its putative hybrids with trembling aspen (Populus tremula L.) and Simon's poplar (P. simonii Carr.). Fungal isolates were obtained in 2008 - 2010 from 15 different genotypes of willows, including seven varieties of common osier (4 Swedish and 3 Polish), two landraces of common osier and six putative hybrids with poplars. Fungal isolates originated from three experiment sites, including west (Wielkopolska and Lubuskie) and north-east (Warmia) regions of Poland. To ensure the genetic uniformity, the isolates were derived from single uredinia, obtained from natural infection conditions. In all collected samples the position of uredinia was always hypophyllous. The diameter of uredinia was measured by Sigma Scan Pro software, after inoculation of four standard genotypes, including two common <b>osier</b> and two <b>willow</b> hybrids. The studies proved that the main cause of common osier rust is Melampsora larici-epitea f. typica. All studied isolates, including the ones obtained on putative hybrids, were very similar according to the size of uredinia and the size and morphology of urediniospores. The average size of a uredinium was 1. 1 mm diameter and slightly differed between the isolates (from 0. 9 to 1. 3 mm), depending on willow genotype, the quality of plant material used for artificial inoculations and infection conditions. The average size of a typical urediniospore was 12. 4 x 10. 5 µm, but the sizes varied from 9. 8 to 13. 2 µm. Urediniospores from common osier were slightly bigger and more oval (12. 5 x 10. 4 µm) as compared to spores from the putative hybrids Salix x Populus (12. 3 x 10. 6 µm), but the differences were statistically insignificant. The spores were ovoid, globoid or angular, evenly echinulated. The size of uredinia, as well as the size and morphology of urediniospores were in full agreement with literature data for M. larici-epitea f. typica...|$|R
