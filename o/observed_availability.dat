40|$|We have {{an ongoing}} {{interest}} in using system dynamics modeling to provide insights for citizens {{and policy makers}} on the impact and implications of human behavior on the course of disease outbreaks. The idea that humans might behave in ways not predicted by rational disaster planning efforts seems to be largely overlooked. In this paper we describe our efforts to understand and to simulate {{the ways in which}} three specific behaviors [...] fleeing, seeking care, and isolating oneself [...] affect the simulated course of an outbreak of pneumonic plague in a city of 1. 5 million inhabitants. This model was initialized to represent Surat, India and then used to explore a pneumonic plague outbreak in September 1994. Our work proceeded through several phases. We first constructed a basic S-E-I-R model of the transmission of pneumonic plague through an urban population of 1. 5 million inhabitants using data from analyses of early 20 th century outbreaks in San Francisco and Manchuria and a more recent one in Madagascar. This model was then used to initialized to represent Surat, India, and used to explore the impact of human behaviors on the course of the simulated outbreak, using the real data from Surat to evaluate the model. With the basic disease model in hand, we then added the <b>observed</b> <b>availability</b> of antibiotics to the model as well as structures to represent the thre...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} {{a system for}} application checkpoint scheduling in volatile resource environments. Our approach combines historical measurements of resource availability with an estimate of checkpoint/recovery delay to generate checkpoint intervals that minimize overhead. When executing in a desktop computing or resource harvesting context, long-running applications must checkpoint, since resources can be reclaimed by their owners without warning. Our system records the historical availability from each resource and fits a statistical model to the observations using either Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) or Expectation Maximization (EM). When an application is initiated on a particular resource, the system uses the computed distribution to parameterize a Markov state-transition model for the application’s execution, evaluates the expected overhead {{as a function of}} the checkpoint interval, and numerically optimizes this quantity. Using Condor as a target platform, we investigate the effectiveness of this technique fitting exponential, Weibull, 2 -phase hyperexponential and 3 -phase hyperexponential distributions to <b>observed</b> <b>availability</b> data. To verify our method and compare the distributions each against the same conditions, we use observations taken from the Condor pool at the University of Wisconsin and trace-based simulation. We examine the practical value of our approach by observing an implementation of our system when applied to a test application that is then run on the “live ” Condor system. Finally, we conclude with a verification of the simulated results against the experimental observations. Our results indicate that application efficiency is relatively insensitive t...|$|E
40|$|The {{standardized}} Document Delivery Tests (DDT's) developed earlier (Bulletin 56 : 241 - 267, July 1968) {{were employed}} to assess the capability of ninety-two medical school libraries for meeting the document needs of biomedical researchers, and the capability of fifteen major resource libraries for filling I-L requests from biomedical libraries. The primary test data are summarized as statistics on the <b>observed</b> <b>availability</b> status of the 300 plus documents in the test samples, and as measures expressing capability {{as a function of}} the mean time that would be required for users to obtain test sample documents. A mathematical model is developed in which the virtual capability of a library, as seen by its users, equals the algebraic sum of the basic capability afforded by its holdings; the combined losses attributable to use of its collection, processing, relative inacessibility, and housekeeping problems; and the gain realized by coupling with other resources (I-L borrowing). For a particular library, or group of libraries, empirical values for each of these variables can be calculated easily from the capability measures and the status statistics. Regression equations are derived that provide useful predictions of basic capability from collection size. The most important result of this work is that cost-effectiveness analyses can now be used as practical decision aids in managing a basic library service. A program of periodic surveys and further development of DDT's is recommended as appropriate for the Medical Library Association...|$|E

40|$|With growing {{emphasis}} on health systems strengthening in global health, various health facility assessment {{methods have been}} used increasingly to measure medicine and commodity availability. However, few studies have systematically compared estimates of availability based on different definitions. The objective {{of this study was}} to compare estimates of medicine availability based on different definitions. A secondary data analysis was conducted using data from the Service Provision Assessment (SPA) - a nationally representative sample survey of health facilities - conducted in five countries: Kenya SPA 2010, Namibia SPA 2009, Rwanda SPA 2007, Tanzania SPA 2006, and Uganda SPA 2007. For 32 medicines, percent of facilities having the medicine were estimated using five definitions: four for current availability and one for six-month period availability. 'Observed availability of at least one valid unit' was used as a reference definition, and ratios between the reference and each of the other four estimates were calculated. Summary statistics of the ratios among the 32 medicines were calculated by country. The ratios were compared further between public and non-public facilities within each country. Across five countries, compared to current <b>observed</b> <b>availability</b> of at least one valid unit, 'reported availability without observation' was on average 6 % higher (ranging from 3 % in Rwanda to 8 % in Namibia), 'observed availability where all units were valid' was 11 % lower (ranging from 2 % in Tanzania to 19 % in Uganda), and 'six-month period availability' was 14 % lower (ranging from 5 % in Namibia to 25 % in Uganda).

However, worldwide production of wooden building materials has decreased due to industrialization, and this trend is expected to continue into the foreseeable future. Also, the prices of wooden raw materials are increasing, which hampers the growth of the wood product business.

40|$|The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) {{maintains}} inter-domain {{routing information}} by announcing and withdrawing IP prefixes. These routing updates can cause prefixes to be unreachable for periods of time, reducing prefix <b>availability</b> <b>observed</b> from different vantage {{points on the}} Internet. The <b>observed</b> prefix <b>availability</b> values may not meet the standards promised by Service Level Agreements (SLAs). In this paper, we develop a framework for predicting long-term availability of prefixes, given short-duration prefix information from publicly available BGP routing databases like RouteViews, and prediction models constructed from information about other Internet prefixes. We compare three prediction models and find that machine learning-based prediction methods outperform a baseline model that predicts the future availability of a prefix {{to be the same}} as its past availability. Our results show that mean time to failure is the most important attribute for predicting availability. We also quantify how prefix availability is related to prefix length and update frequency. Our prediction models achieve 82 % accuracy and 0. 7 ranking quality when predicting for a future duration equal to the learning duration. We can also predict for a longer future duration, with graceful performance reduction. Our models allow ISPs to adjust BGP routing policies if predicted availability is low, and are generally useful for cloud computing systems, content distribution networks, P 2 P, and VoIP applications...|$|R

Patterns of camel forage availability remained unchanged because camels were only observed in the pastoral zone of Moroto district.

However, in the pastoral zone, a rapid rise in limited forage availability for cattle is <b>observed</b> outstripping <b>availability</b> in October with an extremely low period in January.

Our results indicate that availability duration can be predicted with quantifiable confidence bounds and that these bounds can be used as conservative bounds on lifetime predictions.
