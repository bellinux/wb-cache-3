5|$|Internal realism was {{the view}} that, {{although}} {{the world may}} be causally independent of the human mind, {{the structure of the}} world—its division into kinds, individuals and categories—is a function of the human mind, and hence the world is not ontologically independent. The general idea is influenced by Kant's idea of the dependence of <b>our</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the world on the categories of thought.|$|E
5|$|Gamma ray bursts {{can have}} harmful or {{destructive}} effects on life. Considering {{the universe as}} a whole, the safest environments for life similar to that on Earth are the lowest density regions in the outskirts of large galaxies. <b>Our</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> galaxy types and their distribution suggests that {{life as we know}} it can only exist in about 10% of all galaxies. Furthermore, galaxies with a redshift, z, higher than 0.5 are unsuitable for {{life as we know it}}, because of their higher rate of GRBs and their stellar compactness.|$|E

25|$|Logicism is {{the thesis}} that {{mathematics}} is reducible to logic, and hence nothing but a part of logic. Logicists hold that mathematics can be known a priori, but suggest that <b>our</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> mathematics {{is just part of}} <b>our</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> logic in general, and is thus analytic, not requiring any special faculty of mathematical intuition. In this view, logic is the proper foundation of mathematics, and all mathematical statements are necessary logical truths.|$|E

60|$|We may {{now take}} {{a survey of the}} sources <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>knowledge,</b> as they have {{appeared}} in the course of our analysis. We have first to distinguish <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> things and <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> truths. In each there are two kinds, one immediate and one derivative. <b>Our</b> immediate <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> things, which we called acquaintance, consists of two sorts, according as the things known are particulars or universals. Among particulars, we have acquaintance with sense-data and (probably) with ourselves. Among universals, {{there seems to be no}} principle by which we can decide which can be known by acquaintance, but it is clear that among those that can be so known are sensible qualities, relations of space and time, similarity, and certain abstract logical universals. <b>Our</b> derivative <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> things, which we call knowledge by description, always involves both acquaintance with something and <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> truths. <b>Our</b> immediate <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> truths may be called intuitive knowledge, and the truths so known may be called self-evident truths. Among such truths are included those which merely state what is given in sense, and also certain abstract logical and arithmetical principles, and (though with less certainty) some ethical propositions. <b>Our</b> derivative <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> truths consists of everything that we can deduce from self-evident truths by the use of self-evident principles of deduction.|$|R

25|$|Transpersonal {{psychology}} {{has been}} noted for undervaluing quantitative methods {{as a tool for}} improving <b>our</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> spiritual and transpersonal categories.
