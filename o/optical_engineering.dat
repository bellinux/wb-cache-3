25|$|Today, {{the pure}} science of optics is called optical science or optical physics to {{distinguish}} it from applied optical sciences, which {{are referred to as}} <b>optical</b> <b>engineering.</b> Prominent subfields of <b>optical</b> <b>engineering</b> include illumination engineering, photonics, and optoelectronics with practical applications like lens design, fabrication and testing of optical components, and image processing. Some of these fields overlap, with nebulous boundaries between the subjects terms that mean slightly different things {{in different parts of the}} world and in different areas of industry. A professional community of researchers in nonlinear optics has developed in the last several decades due to advances in laser technology.|$|E

25|$|Many {{electrical}} properties of networks of components (inductors, capacitors, resistors) may be expressed using S-parameters, such as gain, return loss, voltage {{standing wave ratio}} (VSWR), reflection coefficient and amplifier stability. The term 'scattering' is more common to <b>optical</b> <b>engineering</b> than RF engineering, referring to the effect observed when a plane electromagnetic wave is incident on an obstruction or passes across dissimilar dielectric media. In the context of S-parameters, scattering refers {{to the way in}} which the traveling currents and voltages in a transmission line are affected when they meet a discontinuity caused by the insertion of a network into the transmission line. This is equivalent to the wave meeting an impedance differing from the line's characteristic impedance.|$|E
25|$|Shahriar S. Afshar's {{experimental}} {{work was done}} initially at the Institute for Radiation-Induced Mass Studies (IRIMS) in Boston in 2001 and later reproduced at Harvard University in 2003, {{while he was a}} research scholar there. The results were presented at a Harvard seminar in March 2004, and published as conference proceeding by the International Society for <b>Optical</b> <b>Engineering</b> (SPIE). The experiment was featured as the cover story in the July 24, 2004 edition of New Scientist. The New Scientist feature article itself generated many responses, including various letters to the editor that appeared in the August 7 and August 14, 2004 issues, arguing against the conclusions being drawn by Afshar, with John G. Cramer's response. Afshar presented his work also at the American Physical Society meeting in Los Angeles, in late March 2005. His peer-reviewed paper was published in Foundations of Physics in January 2007.|$|E
25|$|A Dresden {{police report}} written {{shortly after the}} attacks {{reported}} that the old town and the inner eastern suburbs had been engulfed in a single fire that had destroyed almost 12,000 dwellings. The same report said that the raids had destroyed 24 banks, 26 insurance buildings, 31 stores and retail houses, 640 shops, 64 warehouses, 2 market halls, 31 large hotels, 26 public houses, 63 administrative buildings, 3 theatres, 18 cinemas, 11 churches, 6 chapels; 5 other cultural buildings, 19 hospitals including auxiliary, overflow hospitals, and private clinics, 39 schools, 5 consulates, the zoo, the waterworks, the railways, 19 postal facilities, 4 tram facilities, and 19 ships and barges. The Wehrmacht's main command post in the Taschenbergpalais, 19 military hospitals {{and a number of}} less significant military facilities were also destroyed. Almost 200 factories were damaged, 136 seriously damaged (including several of the Zeiss Ikon precision <b>optical</b> <b>engineering</b> works), 28 with medium to serious damage, and 35 with light damage.|$|E

25|$|Rose–Hulman {{has four}} main {{classroom}} buildings plus a library, a mechanical engineering lab, and an administration building. The four main buildings are Moench Hall (houses Physics and <b>Optical</b> <b>Engineering,</b> Engineering Management, Mechanical Engineering, and Electrical and Computer Engineering) Olin Hall, Crapo Hall, and Myers Hall. Olin came {{as a result of}} a proposal by Sam Hulbert and was later expanded to add eight more advanced learning classrooms. Olin includes a large occupancy by the Civil Engineering and Chemical Engineering Departments. Crapo is home to the Mathematics Department and has two floors of classrooms. The John T. Myers Center for Technological Research with Industry, the newest academic building, holds the Graduate Studies Office and some Bioengineering Department labs. The lower floor of Meyers hall has been renovated adding new high-tech classrooms to facilitate the growing number of classes offered at Rose. The largest, Moench Hall, is composed of four floors of classrooms, offices, and labs, and was the original academic building on campus built in 1922. All of the remaining departments have offices in Moench.|$|E
500|$|In physics, a photon {{is usually}} denoted by the symbol γ (the Greek letter gamma). This {{symbol for the}} photon {{probably}} derives from gamma rays, which were discovered in 1900 by Paul Villard, named by Ernest Rutherford in 1903, and {{shown to be a}} form of electromagnetic radiation in 1914 by Rutherford and Edward Andrade. In chemistry and <b>optical</b> <b>engineering,</b> photons are usually symbolized by hν, which is the photon energy, where h is Planck constant and the Greek letter ν (nu) is the photon's frequency. [...] Much less commonly, the photon can be symbolized by hf, where its frequency is denoted by f.|$|E
