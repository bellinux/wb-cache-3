5|$|As a crop, the {{blackcurrant}} {{suffers from}} several pests and diseases. The most serious disease is reversion, {{caused by a}} virus transmitted by the blackcurrant gall mite. Another is {{white pine blister rust}} which alternates between two unrelated hosts, one in the genus Ribes (blackcurrant included) and the other a white pine. This fungus caused damage to forests when the fruit was first introduced into North America, where the native white pines have no genetic resistance to the disease. As a result, the blackcurrant has for most of the 20th century been subject to restrictions in parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>as</b> a disease vector. The effectiveness of these restrictions is questionable, since other Ribes species also host the disease and are native to North America.|$|E

5|$|Justice David Souter wrote a dissenting opinion, {{which was}} joined by Justice Antonin Scalia. Souter {{referenced}} prior cases dealing with sovereignty and jurisdiction, from the decision made in United States v. Kagama, to the opinion made in South Dakota v. Bourland. Souter stated that the decision in this case did not align with precedent established in previous cases. Since Duro held that the tribes had lost their inherent sovereignty, {{the only way for}} the tribes to regain jurisdiction over non-member Indians would be by the delegation of that jurisdiction by Congress. Bourland was even more specific as to that point. Souter believed that the only two ways that the tribes could regain their sovereignty would be for Congress to declare that they were independent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> <b>as</b> it did with the Philippines, or for the Court to overturn the concept of a dependent domestic sovereign.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the latter}} half of the 1940s, the various service {{branches}} of the United States had been reducing their inventories from their World War II levels. For the Navy, this resulted in several vessels of various types being decommissioned and either sold for scrap or placed in one of the various United States Navy reserve fleets scattered along the East and West Coast <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> <b>As</b> part of this contraction, three of the Iowa-class battleships had been de-activated and decommissioned; however, President Truman refused to allow Missouri to be decommissioned. Against the advice of Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson, Secretary of the Navy John L. Sullivan, and Chief of Naval Operations Louis E. Denfeld, Truman ordered Missouri to be maintained with the active fleet partly because of his fondness for the battleship and partly because the battleship had been christened by his daughter Margaret Truman.|$|E
5|$|With a mid-level {{ridge to}} its northwest, the {{subtropical}} depression was anticipated to parallel the coastline of the Gulf Coast <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> <b>As</b> a result, it was forecast to attain winds of 45mph (75km/h) and move ashore along southern Mississippi. The circulation became better defined as convection modestly {{increased over the}} center, and within six hours of its development the system transitioned into a tropical depression. The cyclone continued tracking northwestward, making landfall around 0000UTC on September22 near Fort Walton Beach, Florida, with winds of 35mph (55km/h). The cloud pattern deteriorated as it tracked inland, and 3hours after it moved ashore the National Hurricane Center issued its last advisory on the depression. As the depression tracked into Alabama, it became increasingly disorganized, and the system dissipated as a tropical cyclone early on September 22. Its remnant surface low continued west-northwest before dissipating near the Louisiana/Texas border early on September23.|$|E
