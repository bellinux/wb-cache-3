2500|$|The Oyu Tolgoi mine ( [...] , also Oyu Tolgoi, Turquoise Hill) is a {{combined}} <b>open</b> <b>pit</b> <b>and</b> <b>underground</b> mining project in Khanbogd sum within the south Gobi Desert, approximately [...] {{east of the}} Ömnögovi Province capital Dalanzadgad. The site was discovered in 2001 and is being developed as {{a joint venture between}} Turquoise Hill Resources (a majority owned subsidiary of Rio Tinto) with 66% ownership and the Government of Mongolia with 34%. The mine began construction as of 2010 and shipped its first batch of copper, all 5,800 tons of it, on 9 July 2013.|$|E
2500|$|Graphite is mined by both <b>open</b> <b>pit</b> <b>and</b> <b>underground</b> methods. Graphite usually needs beneficiation. This may {{be carried}} out by hand-picking the pieces of gangue (rock) and hand-screening the product or by {{crushing}} the rock and floating out the graphite. Beneficiation by flotation encounters the difficulty that graphite is very soft and [...] "marks" [...] (coats) the particles of gangue. This makes the [...] "marked" [...] gangue particles float off with the graphite, yielding impure concentrate. There are two ways of obtaining a commercial concentrate or product: repeated regrinding and floating (up to seven times) to purify the concentrate, or by acid leaching (dissolving) the gangue with hydrofluoric acid (for a silicate gangue) or hydrochloric acid (for a carbonate gangue).|$|E
2500|$|The Kanichee Mine property, {{formerly}} known as Cuniptau Mine, was first discovered in the early 1900s just before World War I began. A [...] mine shaft with [...] of underground lateral workings was completed on two levels in 1934. At least 11mine claims occupied the area at the time. The core of a widespread massive sulfide deposit composed of palladium, nickel, copper, gold, cobalt, platinum and silver was mined out from underground and by an open pit from 1934 to 1936. Since 1938, at least seven different ownerships have held the Kanichee Mine property. Subsequent mining from 1974 to 1975 increased {{the size of the}} open pit and removed the shaft pillar. The <b>open</b> <b>pit</b> <b>and</b> <b>underground</b> workings have remain flooded since the mine closed in the 1970s.|$|E
50|$|The outcrops, {{such as the}} Butte-Pinson at Montmagny, Pierrefitte and Villetaneuse and the Butte d'Écouen at Villiers-le-Bel and Écouen, contain {{significant}} {{deposits of}} gypsum; which was mined both in <b>open</b> <b>pits</b> <b>and</b> <b>underground</b> until {{the first half of}} the twentieth century. The mining has weakened the structure of the ground to the extent that several risk prevention plans need to be developed.|$|R

50|$|<b>Open</b> <b>pit</b> <b>and</b> <b>underground</b> ore are {{processed}} at the Chirano plant. The {{capacity of the}} mill is approximately 3.5 million tonnes per annum. Processing involves crushing, ball mill grinding, cyanide leaching and carbon-in-leach (CIL) extraction.|$|E
50|$|Gold {{was first}} {{discovered}} in the Wine Harbour Gold District of Nova Scotia in 1860. Between 1862 and 1907 approximately 42,336.5 troy oz of gold (grading an average of 11.73 g/t) was extracted. The bulk of this extraction was {{from a series of}} <b>open</b> <b>pits</b> <b>and</b> <b>underground</b> workings. Historic exploitation of gold via surface pits is rare in Nova Scotia, and it is believed that relatively high grades (perhaps greater than 10g/t Au) were found over significant widths in shallow plunging ore shoots.|$|R
50|$|The Gunnar deposit was {{discovered}} in July 1952 and operated as both an <b>open</b> <b>pit</b> (1955-1961) <b>and</b> <b>underground</b> (1957-1963) mine. The mine ceased production in 1963.|$|R

40|$|Gypsum is an {{important}} raw material for constructions and other industrial sectors. In Piedmont (NW Italy), main gypsum bodies {{are located in the}} Monferrato area, where large <b>open</b> <b>pits</b> <b>and</b> <b>underground</b> quarries are present. The gypsum-bearing formation outcropping in this area shows typical geological, structural, and hydrogeological features, which affect the quarrying and the related interaction with natural phenomena, human activities, and land use. In particular, gypsum karst has considerable influence on mining operations, as well as mining operations can produce strong impact on gypsum karst. In Monferrato, a specific case of interaction between the quarrying activity and geological, hydrogeological, and territorial setting is represented by the event of water inrush that happened in the Moncalvo underground quarry in association with the development of a surface sinkhole phenomenon...|$|R

5000|$|The Russell Mine, one of {{the larger}} {{producers}} in Montgomery County, had a total production of around 15,000 ounces of lode gold. This mine included several <b>open</b> <b>pits</b> <b>and</b> <b>underground</b> workings that attained a depth of over 200 ft. The largest pit, [...] "Big Cut", is about 300 ft. long, 150 ft. wide, and 60 ft. deep. As a whole, material excavated from this pit is said to have averaged $2.00 to the ton in gold. The entire mass is gold-bearing but only certain parts of it are rich enough to work, and even these parts are of low grade except for rich seams that appear and disappear abruptly. Ore is difficult to distinguish from waste, visually. Ore grades averaged about 3.4 grams per tonne (g/t), with higher-grade zones reported. The total production of the Russell Mine is reported to have exceeded $300,000.|$|R
40|$|Current mine {{exposures}} of auriferous {{veins in}} the Charters Towers Goldfield (CTGF) {{are characterized by}} a scarcity of kinematic indicators. Furthermore, the dip direction of exposed and historically mined orebodies largely coincides with the orientation of pre-existing discontinuities. Consequently, the reactivation of earlier structures during gold deposition is strongly indicated. Both factors complicate the structural analysis of the auriferous vein systems, as slip on earlier faults likely occurred before new rock failure and evolution of fault networks reflecting the stress field present {{at the time of}} gold deposition. Despite access to drillcore, <b>open</b> <b>pits</b> <b>and</b> <b>underground</b> workings, extracted data were limited to ten occurrences of wear groove striations and three reverse separations of dykes and a pegmatite cut by sulphide-bearing quartz veins. Because of the scarcity of kinematic information, the structural analysis focused on the geometry of veins and ore-shoots, also applying basic graphical and kinematic methods...|$|R
50|$|Structural geology is a {{critical}} part of engineering geology, which is concerned with the physical and mechanical properties of natural rocks. Structural fabrics and defects such as faults, folds, foliations and joints are internal weaknesses of rocks which may affect the stability of human engineered structures such as dams, road cuts, <b>open</b> <b>pit</b> mines <b>and</b> <b>underground</b> mines or road tunnels.|$|R
50|$|The {{mine was}} {{operating}} as an <b>open</b> <b>pit</b> <b>and</b> <b>underground</b> mine until 2007, {{when the last}} open pit closed.

5000|$|Rampura-Agucha {{deposits}} {{were discovered}} in August, 1977 by T. C. Rampuria, a geologist with the Government of Rajasthan's Directorate of Mines and Geology. Hindustan Zinc Limited started drilling in February, 1980 and a report regarding the estimate of the deposit was submitted in 1981. The development of this mine started in 1988 and the first ore production was in March 1991. Rampura-Agucha has a combination of <b>open</b> <b>pit</b> mine <b>and</b> <b>underground</b> mine ...|$|R
2500|$|Copperfields Mine, {{originally}} {{known as}} Temagami Mine, extracted both base and precious metals on Temagami Island in Lake Temagami from March 1955 until its closer in February 1972. A 200-ton mill refined ore from two <b>open</b> <b>pits</b> <b>and</b> <b>underground</b> workings off a [...] mine shaft. For {{the first few}} years after the mine opened, ore trucks were barged down the northeastern arm of Lake Temagami to the town of Temagami, but this soon proved to be too expensive. The result was to create a gravel road from Highway 11 to the eastcentral shore of Lake Temagami. This road, now known as the Lake Temagami Access Road, was completed in 1958 and was used to transport ore from the mine site. The high-grade copper deposit in which the mine extracted was discovered by Canadian geophysicist Norman Bell Keevil (1910–1989) in the mid-20th century during testing of a newly established airborne metal detector. It was the largest deposit of nearly pure chalcopyrite ever discovered in Canada. Keevil also financed other ventures, including what became Teck Resources. By February 1972, the Copperfields mill had treated [...] of gold, [...] of silver and [...] of copper.|$|R
25|$|Oyu Tolgoi {{will use}} both <b>underground</b> <b>and</b> <b>open</b> <b>pit</b> mining techniques. Initially the mine will process 70,000 tonnes of rock per day, ramping up to 85,000 tonnes {{from both the}} <b>open</b> <b>pit</b> <b>and</b> the <b>underground</b> mine (underground mining {{is to be done}} by block caving). The yield from the first phase of mining will be ground through one semi-autogenous {{grinding}} mill (SAG mill). Expansion to new underground areas will result in an additional increase of up to 140,000 tonnes per day with a possible increase to 170,000 tonnes per day.|$|R
50|$|The mine is a {{combination}} of <b>open</b> <b>pit</b> <b>and</b> <b>underground</b> construction; current estimates put construction costs at $61 million USD.

40|$|The Silvermines area in County Tipperary, Ireland, {{comprises}} an area {{of around}} 5 km 2 plus a 19 ha tailings facility. There {{are a number of}} abandoned <b>open</b> <b>pits</b> <b>and</b> <b>underground</b> mines worked mainly from the 17 th to 20 th century for lead, zinc, copper and barites with some silver. There is a legacy of health and safety issues as well as issues of mining heritage with tourism and educational interest. The challenge is to remove or minimize health and safety risks and achieve European Water Framework Directive requirements, whilst considering what should be conserved or protected, and to minimise the costs. A rehabilitation project has been carried out progressively {{over a number of years}} and is now at the final design and construction stage. Key issues of dust from tailings will be resolved by capping and vegetation; and targeted sources of contaminated water resolved by evaluating the water balance in terms of contributing contaminant loads, to identify the key sources of contamination and to treat with water management and passive treatment systems. The paper summarises the various remediation issues but focuses on the issues related to mine waste disposal. 1. BACKGROUND The Silvermines area of County Tipperary has been mined for over one thousand years, for lead, zinc, copper, baryte and sulphur, although the main activities were in the 19 th and 20 th centuries.
