5|$|Following Noriega's {{fall in the}} December 1989 United States {{invasion}} <b>of</b> <b>Panama,</b> Arias was {{certified as}} vice president <b>of</b> <b>Panama</b> under President Endara and inaugurated on a US military base.|$|E
5|$|Using {{economic}} sanctions and political pressure, the United States mounted {{a campaign to}} drive Panamanian ruler General Manuel Antonio Noriega from power after he fell from favor. In May 1989, after Guillermo Endara had been duly elected President <b>of</b> <b>Panama,</b> Noriega nullified the election outcome, drawing intensified pressure. In October, Noriega suppressed a military coup, but in December, after soldiers of the Panamanian army killed a U.S. serviceman, the United States invasion <b>of</b> <b>Panama</b> began under Cheney's direction. The stated reason for the invasion was to seize Noriega to face drug charges in the United States, protect U.S. lives and property, and restore Panamanian civil liberties. Although the mission was controversial, U.S. forces achieved control <b>of</b> <b>Panama</b> and Endara assumed the Presidency; Noriega was convicted and imprisoned on racketeering and drug trafficking charges in April 1992.|$|E

The genus consists of 64 species, two of which are found in the insular Caribbean. Ten other species are found in the wider Caribbean: G. chococola, G. concinna, G. divisia and G. triandra are found on the Caribbean coast <b>of</b> <b>Panama,</b> G. congesta is found along the Caribbean coast from Honduras to Colombia, G. cuneata is found along the Caribbean coast from Nicaragua to Colombia, G. deversa is found along the Caribbean coast from Belize to Colombia, G. epetiolaris and G. longevaginata are found along the Caribbean coast from Costa Rica to Panama and G. triandra is found along the Caribbean coast <b>of</b> <b>Panama</b> and Colombia.|$|E
50|$|For centuries, {{agriculture}} was {{the dominant}} economic activity for most <b>of</b> <b>Panama's</b> population. After construction <b>of</b> the <b>Panama</b> Canal, agriculture fell as {{a proportion of}} total GDP. Agriculture represented 29 percent of Panamanian GDP in 1950, and just over 9 percent in 1985. In 2009 agriculture and fisheries made up 7.4% <b>of</b> <b>Panama's</b> GDP. Agriculture employs a large number of Panamanians (in relation to its percentage <b>of</b> <b>Panama's</b> GDP) because many farmers are engaged in subsistence farming. The percentage <b>of</b> <b>Panama's</b> labor force in agriculture has fallen from 46 percent in 1965 to 26 percent in 1984.|$|R

50|$|Statistics {{are unclear}} {{as to the}} exact {{percentage}} <b>of</b> <b>Panama's</b> population that are Christian, though the country has large religious minorities who adhere to Buddhism, Islam, Judaism, and indigenous religions. Most numbers consider around four-fifths <b>of</b> <b>Panama's</b> population to be Catholic, and about 19% to be Evangelical Protestant.|$|R
5|$|M249s {{have seen}} action {{in every major}} {{conflict}} involving the United States since the U.S. invasion <b>of</b> <b>Panama</b> in 1989. Due to the weight and age of the weapon, the United States Marine Corps is fielding the M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle with plans to partially replace the M249 in Marine Corps service.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{the same}} {{tropical}} wave that formed Tropical Storm Danny in the Atlantic crossed over the Isthmus <b>of</b> <b>Panama</b> and became a disturbance in the Intertropical Convergence Zone during mid to late September. On September 20 the cloud pattern had increased in organization and the system was designated a tropical depression.|$|E
5|$|Pérez Balladares later {{served as}} {{campaign}} manager for Carlos Duque, Noriega's chosen candidate for the 1989 presidential election. The opposition candidate, Guillermo Endara, was reported by international observers to be leading the vote by a 3-to-1 margin, but the results were annulled by the Noriega government before counting was complete. During the December 1989 US invasion <b>of</b> <b>Panama,</b> however, Endara was certified the election's winner and sworn in as the next president <b>of</b> <b>Panama.</b> During the invasion, Pérez Balladares was briefly detained and interrogated by US forces for his association with Noriega, but was then released.|$|E

5|$|A phylogenetic study {{based on}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA, published by Björn Stelbrink and colleagues in 2010, {{reported that the}} sister species of the Pacific angelshark is the sand devil (S. dumeril) of the western North Atlantic. The two species are estimated to have diverged approximately 6.1 Ma, close to when the Isthmus <b>of</b> <b>Panama</b> first began to form. The authors also found that Pacific angelsharks from the Gulf of California differed genetically from those elsewhere, though they were equivocal as to whether this represented a species-level distinction.|$|E
5|$|Arias {{returned}} to Panama {{in the early}} 1960s to work for political reform, soon joining the small Christian Democratic Party <b>of</b> <b>Panama.</b> In 1972, he left Panama for some time with his family, becoming a dean and later vice president at Florida International University in Miami, Florida in the US.

5|$|Guillermo David Endara Galimany (May 12, 1936 – September 28, 2009) was President <b>of</b> <b>Panama</b> from 1989 to 1994.

50|$|The {{high levels}} of Panamanian trade are in large part from the Colón Free Trade Zone, the largest free trade zone in the Western Hemisphere.

5|$|In 1698, the Company of Scotland {{attempted}} {{a project to}} secure a trading colony on the Isthmus <b>of</b> <b>Panama.</b> Almost every Scottish landowner who had money to spare {{is said to have}} invested in the Darien scheme. Its failure bankrupted these landowners, but not the burghs. Nevertheless, the nobles' bankruptcy, along with the threat of an English invasion, played a leading role in convincing the Scots elite to back a union with England.|$|E
