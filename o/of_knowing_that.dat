5|$|After several {{seasons of}} {{struggling}} for runs, Kippax returned {{to form in}} 193334. Against Queensland at New Year, he hit 125 and shared a stand of 363 in only 135minutes with Bradman. Altogether, he made four centuries and averaged almost 72 to earn selection for the 1934 tour of England. Passed over for the vice-captaincy of the team in favour of Bradman, Kippax had the confidence <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> the Australian Board of Control had reached {{an agreement with the}} MCC that the Australians would not have to face Bodyline during the tour.|$|E
5|$|Helena, knowing Ruiz is soon {{scheduled}} to testify, makes {{a deal with}} Juan Obregón (Bratt), lord of the drug cartel, who forgives the Ayala family's debt and has Ruiz poisoned. Ayala is released, much to the dissatisfaction of Gordon, who is still angry over his partner's death. During a phone conversation between Ayala and Metzger, Ayala deduces that it was Metzger who originally informed on Ruiz. Evidently in a bid for power with another drug cartel in Mexico, Metzger accepted $3 million to inform on Ruiz to the FBI and facilitate the Ayala organization's downfall. Ayala says that Metzger was planning on taking over Ayala's empire completely. As Ayala hangs up the phone, Metzger {{looks up to see}} two hit men entering his office. Soon after Ayala's release, Gordon bursts into the Ayala home during his homecoming celebration. Bodyguards wrestle him to the ground, but Gordon is able to surreptitiously plant a listening bug under Ayala's desk. Gordon is forced from the property, with the satisfaction <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> there is now a new opportunity to trap Ayala.|$|E
5|$|Over Romney Marsh Nos. 41, 92 and 222 Squadrons engaged JG 26, {{losing one}} of their number to the Bf 109s. The second wave of RAF fighters arrived on the scene, {{comprising}} 607 and 213 Squadrons with 23 Hurricanes. They initiated a head-on attack against the Do 17s of KG 3. A Hurricane and a Dornier collided, both going down. The Bf 109s {{did their best to}} break up attacks and the bombers held a tight formation, putting up withering cross-fire. The Bf 109s were not permitted to leave the bombers and chase enemy fighters. Time and again, they were forced to break off and return to the bomber stream, allowing the RAF fighters to return and repeat the process. Soon after, No. 605 and No. 501 Squadron arrived with 14 Hurricanes. One fighter was hit by return fire, but the pilot aimed his aircraft at a Dornier and bailed out. The fighter collided and destroyed the bomber. The German bomber crews had no way <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> the crashes were not premeditated. It seemed as if the British were desperate. Nevertheless, they thought the 'tactic' was devastatingly effective. Chastened by losses, the Dorniers closed ranks to snuff out the gaps and continued to their target.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, NASA {{released}} a detailed report on survivability {{aspects of the}} Columbia reentry. The crew would have had {{less than a minute}} between the beginning of orbiter disintegration and depressurization. The structural failure of the left wing set off alarms in the cabin, although they had no way <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> the wing had broken apart as the rear of the orbiter could not be seen from the cabin. All evidence indicated that the crew frantically tried to regain control of Columbia as it began to spin out of control, but the loss of the left wing caused the orbiter to yaw to the right, exposing its underside to extreme aerodynamic forces and causing total structural disintegration. The crew cabin separated {{from the rest of the}} orbiter and rapidly depressurized, which would have killed or incapacitated the astronauts within seconds. Afterwards, the cabin spun around at high RPM, which caused the seat restraints on their upper bodies to fail. They were thus whipped around violently and pummeled by flying and falling objects from the disintegrating cabin, along with their heads and necks being slammed against the helmets, which were not designed to provide any head protection. Even if the cabin had remained structurally intact and reached a lower altitude where air could refill it, the high altitude depressurization would have been fatal to the astronauts unless they received medical attention within 5 minutes, approximately the amount of time it would take between cerebral hypoxia and brain death.|$|E

Retired army surgeon Dr. J. W. Gardiner also testified that he saw the bulge in Tom's pants.

Writer Archie Goodwin cited [...] "the comfort <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> I would be working with Al Williamson, an old friend that I've worked with over the years. He was absolutely the best Star Wars artist you could ever want to have. That makes it easier because you feel that whatever you do as a writer, you have an artist that will make it look great.
