25|$|There {{have been}} few changes to the exteriors of the buildings.

In 1966, the basement of 328 East 69th was converted into a garage.

But there has been substantial renovation of building interiors; for example, 342 East 69th Street has had new windows, plumbing, electricity, roof, floor boards, and cooling systems.|$|R

[...] "You {{ought to see}} them in town, these summer nights, in the parks and squares and cheap theatres.

60|$|It peered round a corner, stealthily. It was an ascetic face, {{very sharp}} and clear-cut. It had a stately profile. The long and wiry grizzled moustache, the deep-set, hawk-like eyes, the acute, intense, {{intellectual}} features, all were very familiar. So was the outer setting of long, white hair, straight and silvery as it fell, and just curled in one wave-like inward sweep where it turned and rested <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stooping</b> shoulders. But <b>the</b> expression <b>on</b> <b>the</b> face was even stranger than the sudden apparition. It {{was an expression}} of keen and poignant disappointment--as of a man whom fate has baulked of some well-planned end, his due by right, which mere chance has evaded.|$|R

But it looked defeated now, his body, it clambered and fell with slow clumsiness. He was breathing hoarsely too, like an animal that is suffering. He sat slack and motionless in the boat, his head blunt and blind like a seal's, his whole appearance inhuman, unknowing. Gudrun shuddered as she mechanically followed his boat. Birkin rowed without speaking to the landing-stage.|$|R
60|$|When Jerry {{reached the}} house he found little Dottie <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stoop,</b> with Tommy in her arms. Tommy was crying for {{something}} to eat, {{and the little girl}} was having her hands full with him.|$|E

60|$|The Queen {{clasped her}} hands on her face, and, resting her arms <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table, <b>stooped</b> down her head and wept so bitterly, that the tears were seen to find their way in streams between the white and slender fingers with which she endeavoured to conceal them.|$|R
