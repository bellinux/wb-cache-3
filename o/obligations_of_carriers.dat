50|$|These {{rules of}} law, whether common law or statute law, that {{regulate}} the <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriers</b> of goods by sea, are of most importance in {{cases in which}} there is an affreightment without any written agreement. It is, therefore, convenient to consider first cases of this kind where there is no express agreement, oral or written, except as to the freight and destination of the goods, and where, consequently, the rights and obligations of the parties as to all other terms of carriage depend wholly upon the rules of law, remembering always that these same rules apply when there is a written contract, except insofar as they are qualified or negated by the terms of such contract.|$|E

A case study was mailed to 200 physicians, nurses, and students in medicine, philosophy and business in Asia (Hong Kong, Beijing) and Europe (Vienna, Frankfurt, Bochum). We asked about moral institutions in professional disclosure and moral <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriers</b> towards family members. A majority, even stronger in Asia, supported the 'right to know ' versus a 'right not to know', also called for changes in health policy to make genetic testing and counselling affordable and more widely available.

40|$|The Matter <b>of</b> Air <b>Carrier’s</b> Liability Insurance {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} problems in Air Transportation in Indonesia, because the air carrier’s liability insurance is in relation with liability <b>of</b> the <b>carrier.</b> Liability is clearly a risk, that is to say a financial risk. The risk is being under the legal obligation to pay compensation to others for damages suffered as a consequence of our acts. For that, in Indonesia, the <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>carrier</b> for his liability insurances is regulated in Article 179 and Article 180 of Law Number 1 Year 2009 concerning Aviation (“Law No. 1 / 2009 ”), which is subsequently implemented in Article 16 and Article 17 of Regulation of Minister of Transportation Number 77 Year 2011 concerning Air Carrier’s Liability (“PM No. 77 / 2011 ”). Sanction for Air Transportation Company that does not insure its liability is provided in Article 26 and Article 27 PM No. 77 / 2011.

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to acquaint the reader with the reasons for {{mortality}} of broilers during their transport to the slaughterhouse. Materials for your own research (from 2012) {{were obtained from the}} State Veterinary Administration of a company Vodňanská drůbež s. r. o., the argest supplier of poultry meat in the Czech Republic. The second chapter deals with legislation relating to animals in general, but also legislation that governs the protection primarily for meat production. Welfare of broilers, therefore, their comfort, and handling is dealt with in the third chapter. It describes picking halls, catching chickens, chicken waste, transport of poultry for slaughter, chickens and unloading conditions to be met by the authorized person when handling poultry. The fourth chapter describes the factors affecting the welfare of broiler chickens during fattening. These factors include the type of litter, microclimate - thermoregulation poultry, lighting, and health status of broilers. Because the work deals with the mortality of broilers during transport, the fifth chapter is devoted to this issue. There are analyzed transport requirements, the effect of high and low temperature for transporting poultry. Furthermore, means of transport and the <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriers</b> during transport to the slaughterhouse, whether it's planning a trip or taking care of animals during transport. The sixth chapter deals with the custom dissertation: In 2012, it was the slaughterhouses (company Vodňanská drůbež s. r. o.) moved from 116 breeders 30, 231, 410 pieces of broilers at slaughter, of which 136, 616 units during transport died at a mean of 0. 455 %.

40|$|The present-day {{law on the}} {{carriage}} of goods by sea suffers from a lack of uniformity and from being not able to adequately address the current developments in the industry of international shipping. The leading liability regime which is in force, the Hague-Visby Rules, consists of rather outdated provisions that Courts need to interpret accordingly in order to achieve the intended objects of the Rules: {{to strike a balance between}} the interests <b>of</b> <b>carriers</b> and shippers, and also to ensure that this balance is applied uniformly. The current thesis focuses precisely on the area <b>of</b> the <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> the <b>carrier</b> over the cargo. The research aims at studying how the specific provisions regulating the carrier’s cargo-related obligations manifest themselves, particularly in English law. However, the research points also to how other jurisdictions address the problems discussed in the present thesis. These are, in particular, the bundle <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> set forth in Article III rule 2 of the Hague-Visby Rules as well as how the same are applied in the context of specific issues such as the incorporation of a FIOS(T) clause in the contract of carriage; the stowage on deck, and {{the carriage}} of containerized cargo. Since the analysis extensively covers also the position under the Rotterdam Rules, the end results can lead to more comprehensive conclusions with regard to the need of a reform unifying the fragmented rules on carriage of goods by sea and, in particular, the provision governing the carrier’s obligation over the cargo...|$|R

40|$|In August 2008, the FCC {{found that}} Comcast's {{restrictions}} on peer-to-peer upload transmissions were unreasonably discriminatory, arbitrarily targeted a particular application, and deprived consumers {{of their rights}} to run Internet applications and use services of their choice. The Comcast ruling represents {{a significant change in}} the FCC's direction: given the FCC's past decisions that broadband Internet access services do not fall within the "common carrier" category, it is notable that the agency has now imposed nondiscrimination requirements on these services. This Article shows that the rationales articulated in the FCC's Comcast order, stressing both (i) concerns about protecting competition and (ii) concerns about protecting consumers from disruption of their ability to communicate freely and privately, are rooted in centuries of Anglo-American law defining he <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> "common <b>carriers.</b> " The FCC appears to be moving away from its traditional emphasis on the competition policy concerns, which justify asymmetrical regulation of dominant providers for the sake of enabling competition, and toward an emphasis on the consumer protection issues, which justify symmetrical regulation of all service providers regardless whether they have market power. These developments in the U. S. echo the discussion now going on in Europe {{in the context of the}} package of proposals on a new common regulatory framework for telecommunications, released by the European Commission on Nov. 13, 2007, and which is now being debated by the European Parliament and Council.

Second, I point out that Risse's understanding <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> accountability and justification is rather narrow in that it functions as an addendum to <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice. Conversely, I will suggest that the <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> accountability plays a deeper role: The conditions that ground it feature {{at the same time}} among the grounds <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice. Accordingly, the kind of relation that gives rise to a duty among agents to account for their actions must be in place when <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice obtain.

Through identifying a core concept of citizenship, I suggest that citizenship obligations are, by their nature, owed (at least in part) in virtue of other aspects of one's common citizenship, and that <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice, even when they arise as a result of interconnectedness or past interactions, are not best conceived as <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> citizenship in the absence of some other bond that unites the parties. Without ruling out the possibility of beneficial conceptual change, I argue that Andrew Dobson's model of ecological citizenship is flawed because there is no good reason to regard the <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> environmental justice which it identifies as <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> ecological citizenship, and that other models of cosmopolitan or global citizenship face a similar objectio...|$|R

40|$|In Just Health, Norman Daniels makes {{a strong}} {{argument}} for <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> mutual assistance {{to fulfill the}} right to health {{at the national level}} and challenges readers to develop arguments supporting <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> mutual assistance at the global level. In this paper, we argue that there is global responsibility for global health and that there are <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice (beyond charity) to help fulfill (not merely respect or even protect) the right to health in other countries; these we call <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> global health justice. We show how international human rights law affirms <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> global health justice - beyond national obligations and beyond <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> charity - and assert that the human rights approach provides guidance on delineating the relationship between national and global responsibility for fulfilling the core obligations that arise from socioeconomic human rights and addressing global health inequities. We further argue that new ways of providing international assistance, originating from the global HIV/AIDS response, demonstrate the feasibility of improving health outcomes through exogenous efforts and that <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> global health justice thus carry much weight: the weight of lives not saved. The global response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic has led to {{the emergence of a new}} international health assistance paradigm, and the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria is, we suggest, an embryonic form of this new paradigm. We conclude that agreements on several common parameters delineating global and national responsibility for global health can advance the movement towards a global institution for the distribution of health-related goods...|$|R
