5|$|Arsenal {{struggled}} to regain fluency {{in the second}} half, as their opponents dominated play. In the 53rd minute, United scored to make it 4–3; Charlie Mitten's flick in the area was diverted into the Arsenal net by Lionel Smith for an own goal. United fashioned further chances through Burke and Rowley, but for large periods {{of the second half}} the Arsenal defence stood firm. Jones' headed goal was rule out for offside, after which the match descended into a contest between United's attack and Arsenal's defence. Jimmy Delaney came closest to equalising late <b>on,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> darted forward and missed by inches.|$|E
5|$|The third administrator, James E. Webb (1961–1968), {{appointed}} by President John F. Kennedy, was a Democrat who first publicly served under President Harry S. Truman. In order {{to implement the}} Apollo program to achieve Kennedy's Moon landing goal {{by the end of}} the 1960s, Webb directed major management restructuring and facility expansion, establishing the Houston Manned Spacecraft (Johnson) Center and the Florida Launch Operations (Kennedy) Center. Capitalizing on Kennedy's legacy, President Lyndon Johnson kept continuity with the Apollo program by keeping Webb <b>on</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> succeeded Kennedy in November 1963. But Webb resigned in October 1968 before Apollo achieved its goal, and Republican President Richard M. Nixon replaced Webb with Republican Thomas O. Paine.|$|E
5|$|Another {{controversy}} {{surrounds the}} sole {{survivor of the}} flight, a Czech officer, Eduard Prchal. Prchal, like many pilots who {{did not wish to}} tempt fate was known for never wearing his Mae West life jacket — but on this occasion, when rescued from the sea, he was wearing one. During the inquiry he denied this, and later blamed the inconsistency on post-crash shock affecting his actions and memory – essentially, on amnesia. Later he explained that he must have instinctively put the vest <b>on</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> realised the plane was in trouble. Polish aviation expert Jerzy Maryniak created a simulation of the crash, in which he concluded that the plane must have been under control up until the very moment of the crash. Kisielewski argues that the plane was likely {{under the control of the}} second pilot, who died in the crash.|$|E

5|$|Having {{learned the}} truth about Dexter's identity, Arthur (John Lithgow) confronts Dexter (Michael C. Hall) at the police station, where nobody else knows Arthur is the Trinity Killer. He warns Dexter to leave him alone from now <b>on.</b> <b>When</b> <b>he</b> leaves, Dexter follows Arthur in his car, and accidentally strikes another car on his way. Dexter follows Arthur to a bank, where he sees Arthur bring a large {{envelope}} back to his van. Dexter attacks Arthur, knocking him out and dragging him into the van, and Dexter realizes the envelope is filled with cash. Dexter plans to take Arthur's van away and kill Arthur, but he spots {{the driver of the}} car he struck earlier talking to police officers next to Dexter's car. Dexter hides the envelope and confronts the driver, who acts very irritable. A frustrated Dexter attacks him and is detained by the police. By the time he is released, Arthur is gone, but Dexter recovers the envelope of money.|$|E
5|$|Hawkins {{was born}} in Finley, New South Wales to Jack and Jenny Hawkins. He {{grew up in the}} New South Wales region of Finley as the middle child among three other siblings. He {{attended}} Finley High School and played for the Finley Football Club before making the move south of the border to begin boarding at Melbourne Grammar School. Hawkins' footballing ability was recognised early <b>on</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was selected to play first XVIII football for the school whilst still in year ten, when many of his teammates were completing their final year of schooling at year twelve. Hawkins kicked four goals on debut for the school and his performances up forward soon received attention from AFL recruiting teams. By the time he had reached his final school year he was rewarded with joint captaincy of the football team alongside Hawthorn draftee Xavier Ellis. He was also selected in the Associated Public Schools (APS) team to play the Associated Grammar School (AGS) selected football team in the traditional annual clash of schools, where he won best on ground honours for his performance.|$|E
5|$|Kosygin {{protected}} János Kádár's {{economic reforms}} and {{his position as}} leader of the People's Republic of Hungary from intervention by the Soviet leadership. Polish leader Władysław Gomułka, who was removed from all of his posts in 1970, was succeeded by Edward Gierek who tried to revitalise the economy of the People's Republic of Poland by borrowing money from the First World. The Soviet leadership approved both countries' respective economic experiments, since it was trying to reduce its large Eastern Bloc subsidy programme in the form of cheap oil and gas exports. During the discussions within the Soviet leadership of a possible Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia Kosygin reminded leaders of the consequences of the Soviet suppression of the 1956 Hungarian revolution. Kosygin's stance became more aggressive later <b>on</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> understood that the reforms in Czechoslovakia could be turned against his 1965 Soviet economic reform.|$|E

5|$|Ray {{gathered}} an inexperienced crew, {{although both}} his cameraman Subrata Mitra and art director Bansi Chandragupta {{went on to}} achieve great acclaim. The cast consisted of mostly amateur actors. He started shooting in late 1952 with his personal savings and hoped to raise more money once he had some passages shot, but did not succeed on his terms. As a result, Ray shot Pather Panchali over three years, an unusually long period, based <b>on</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> or his production manager Anil Chowdhury could raise additional funds. He refused funding from sources who wanted a change in script or supervision over production. He also ignored advice from the government to incorporate a happy ending, but he did receive funding {{that allowed him to}} complete the film. Ray showed an early film passage to the American director John Huston, who was in India scouting locations for The Man Who Would Be King. The passage was of the vision which Apu and his sister have of the train running through the countryside, the only sequence which Ray had yet filmed due to his small budget. Huston notified Monroe Wheeler at the New York Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) that a major talent was on the horizon.|$|E
5|$|Willkie's {{condition}} only worsened as {{the weeks}} went on. He went to New York by rail in mid-September, but on the trip he was stricken with another heart attack. Although his advisors told him to seek treatment and abandon the trip, Willkie pressed <b>on.</b> <b>When</b> <b>he</b> arrived in New York, Willkie was in great pain and his press secretary called an ambulance {{to take him to}} Lenox Hill Hospital. He recovered to some extent, enough so that his friends expected him to be discharged. He spent time working on the galleys of his second book, An American Program, and planned future projects. On October 4, Willkie caught a throat infection, which was treated with penicillin. As he was recovering, Willkie's now chronic heart attacks struck again and he suffered three more attacks on October 7. The hospital, which had been issuing reassuring bulletins to the public, was now forced to inform the public that Willkie's condition had worsened and that he was critically ill. The next morning, Willkie suffered one last attack which proved fatal. From the time he checked into Lenox Hill Hospital, he was said to have suffered over a dozen heart attacks.|$|E
5|$|Aleppo {{was then}} a major {{intellectual}} center of the Ottoman Empire, featuring many thinkers and writers concerned with {{the future of the}} Arabs. It was in the French missionary schools that the Marrash family learnt Arabic with French and other foreign languages (Italian and English). But Francis at first studied the Arabic language and its literature privately. At the age of four years, Marrash had contracted measles, and had ever since suffered from eye problems that had kept worsening over time. Hoping to find a treatment, his father had therefore taken him to Paris in 1850; Francis stayed there for about a year, after which he was sent back to Aleppo while his father remained in Paris. In 1853, Francis accompanied his father once again, on a business trip of several months to Beirut, where there was a noticeable presence and cultural influence of Europeans. Francis experienced similar cultural contact later <b>on,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> received private tutoring in medicine for four years under a British physician, in Aleppo—he had by then developed a keen interest in science, and in medicine in particular. At the same time, he wrote and published several works. Marrash practiced medicine for about a year; however, deeming it safer for his trade to become a state-licensed physician, he went to Paris in 1866 so as to continue his medical education at a school. But his fragile health and his growing blindness forced him to interrupt his studies within a year after his arrival. He returned to Aleppo completely blind, but still managed to dictate his works.|$|E

5|$|By August 9, the {{production}} {{was already a}} full day behind schedule. Despite the delays, Wise refused to shoot more than twelve hours on set, feeling he lost his edge afterwards. The director was patient on set; bets were placed <b>on</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> would finally lose his temper, but pool organizers returned the money when Wise never lost his cool. Given his unfamiliarity with the source material Wise relied on the actors, especially Shatner, to help ensure that dialog and characterizations {{were consistent with the}} show. While the bridge scenes were shot early, trouble with filming the transporter room scene delayed further work. Crew working on the transporter platform found their footwear melting on the lighted grid while shooting tests. Issues with the wormhole sequences caused further delays. The footage for the scene was filmed two ways; first, at the standard 24frames per second, and then at the faster 48frames; the normal footage was a back-up if the slow-motion effect produced by the faster frame speed did not turned out as planned. The shoot dragged on so long that it became a running joke for cast members to try and top each other with wormhole-related puns. The scene was finally completed on August 24, while the transporter scenes were being filmed at the same time on the same soundstage.|$|E

Luis Moreno-Ocampo, the chief prosecutor, stated {{that some of the}} funds were being held in the part-nationalize Lloyds Banking Group.
