5|$|Following a {{long period}} of decline, the house was {{purchased}} in the 1980s by a group of local residents and restored as part of its conversion to offices. It became a focal point for Ickenham during the biennial Ickenham Festival when the grounds were used to host the main gala day, until the house's new owners restricted access in 2014. Swakeleys is open in part once a year to the public as part of Open House London. Planning permission was granted in 2014 for the conversion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>to</b> form one large, residential property.|$|E
5|$|Four two storey residences, Numbers 8, 10, 16 and 18 The Terrace, {{were built}} during the 1850s for officer accommodation. Number 8, {{also known as}} the Chaplain's House, is a two storey house with {{rendered}} and painted limestone walls. The plan is roughly square with verandahs and balconies along the west and south sides. A single storey building connects the south-east side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>to</b> the main prison wall.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} life, Richard Gibbs {{recognised}} that the diverse {{interests of the}} large family, {{and the need to}} invest heavily in even basic refurbishment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>to</b> make it weather-secured and habitable, would require the family to sell Tyntesfield. Recognising also that substantial death duties would become payable on his death, Richard drew up a will based around a trust that would allow his fortune to pass to the surviving children of his brother and half sister, a total of 19 beneficiaries.|$|E

5|$|Perry Ellwood {{undertook}} major renovations which {{added and}} changed rooms in 1910. On the home's exterior the porte cochere was {{moved from the}} south facade to its present position on the north facade. On {{the south side of}} the home a large brick terrace was added and the conservatory moved from the southwest side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>to</b> the rear (west). The full-length tower on the home's southwest corner was entirely removed during this renovation.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Tracy sneaks out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>to</b> {{join the}} protest, which is halted {{by a police}} roadblock. The protesters engage in a brawl, while Tracy runs to the Pingletons' home and hides in a fallout shelter. However, Penny's mother, Prudence, reports Tracy to the police before tying her {{daughter}} to her bed. Having been bailed out by Wilbur, Seaweed and his friends help Tracy and Penny escape. Link visits Tracy’s house to look for her and realizes he loves her. Seaweed and Penny also acknowledge their love during the escape.|$|E
5|$|The north façade {{has three}} bays {{separated}} by windows and features a loggia, typical of early 17th-century houses, {{with a central}} arched entrance to accommodate coaches. The central bay is crowned by an ornamental pierced parapet below a niched Dutch gable, which shelters a small statue of Lord Zouche or James I. There are small obelisks at {{either side of the}} gable. Thorpe originally intended the main entrance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>to</b> be on this side, building on the gatehouse of the earlier Foxley house.|$|E

50|$|The {{neighbourhood}} {{was started}} in 1841 with Agar's widow leasing out small plots on <b>the</b> north side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> canal. Ownership passed to the Church Commissioners, who sold it to the Midland Railway. The company demolished most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> <b>to</b> make way for warehouses supplying St Pancras railway station from 1866.|$|R
50|$|The {{degree to}} which the lamp may be focused is limited by <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing.</b> <b>To</b> reduce <b>the</b> width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beam, the lamp and {{reflector}} are moved further back from the lens (spot focus). However, the farther back in <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> <b>the</b> lamp is placed, the more light is wasted in <b>the</b> <b>housing.</b>|$|R
5|$|After {{scouting}} Vancouver for a {{place to}} film scenes that involved the Swan house, {{the decision was made to}} recreate the house on an empty lot with a tree line and approaching road. The production team was able to rearrange the exterior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>to</b> match that in the first movie. When faced with creating the interior, the team measured the house in Portland, and built various pieces of the house on the lot and on a stage in Vancouver. The second film also attempted to clarify the location of Bella's room, which, as seen in the first film, seemed to be located in the front of the house, when in reality it was on the right-hand side. Complications arose when the Portland house was repainted after Twilights release, which took away the aging the house had come to depict in the film. When recreating the house, the production team referenced the first film on high-definition Blu-ray Disc.|$|E
5|$|Convinced {{that he has}} {{not done}} {{anything}} wrong, Bart decides to run away from home, taking Santa's Little Helper with him. While wandering the streets, he visits a breadline that is serving Thanksgiving dinner for homeless people. A television crew led by Kent Brockman is covering the event, and they interview Bart. The family sees the report on television and calls the police, hoping that they can find Bart and return him. When the police fail, Homer and Marge start to regret the bad things they said to Bart, who eventually returns home feeling remorseful. However, his dilemma is worsened when he imagines his family blaming him for everything if he apologized for ruining Thanksgiving. Back to the present, he realizes that it was all his own imagination. He climbs up onto the roof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>to</b> think things out. Hearing Lisa cry because she misses him, Bart calls for her to come onto the roof. He then realizes that what he did was wrong and apologizes to her. Bart later rejoins the family to enjoy a meal of Thanksgiving leftovers.|$|E
5|$|Now {{an escape}} seemed like Berkman's only option. The {{plan was to}} rent a {{house across the street}} from the prison and dig an {{underground}} tunnel from the house to the prison. Berkman had been given access to a large portion of the prison and had grown familiar with its layout. In April 1900, a house was leased. The tunnel would be dug from the cellar <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>to</b> the stable inside the prison yard. When the digging was complete, Berkman would sneak into the stable, tear open the wooden flooring, and crawl through the tunnel to the house.|$|E

50|$|In 1860, Odell built 15 North Grove Street as {{a wedding}} gift for his daughter. The same year Marcus Raymond, a local {{newspaper}} editor, built 2 North Grove Street. <b>The</b> last <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>to</b> be built was 8 North Grove Street, home to three generations <b>of</b> local physicians. <b>The</b> ground floor was used as their office.|$|R
5|$|Somerset House {{was built}} by Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, regent of England from 1547 to 1549, {{demolishing}} three inns and {{the church of the}} Nativity of Our Lady and the Innocents in the process. After Somerset was executed in 1552, it became an occasional residence for Princess Elizabeth. When she became Queen in 1558, she returned part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>to</b> Seymour's family (with ownership passing to his son, Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford); the remainder was an occasional meeting place for the Royal Society. After Elizabeth's death in 1603, it was owned by Anne of Denmark, wife of James VI and I. The building was renamed Denmark House in commemoration of Anne's brother, Christian IV of Denmark. After James died in 1625, his body lay there intestate for a month. The building was taken over by Parliament in 1645 following the Civil War, renaming it back to Somerset House. It had an irregular series of owners and residents for much of the 18th century until it was demolished in 1775. The house was rebuilt as a series of government buildings. The Stamp Office, later to become the Inland Revenue was established in Somerset House in 1789. In the late 20th century, a number of art galleries were set up on vacant parts, including the Courtauld Institute of Art and the King's College London School of Law.|$|E
