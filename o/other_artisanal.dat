50|$|It is {{predominantly}} an inshore fish, inhabiting reefs down to depths of around 100 m in both coastal zones and offshore islands, often venturing into estuaries and sandy bays as juveniles. The bigeye trevally is {{commonly found in}} large slow moving schools during the day, becoming active at night when it feeds, taking a variety of fish, crustaceans, cephalopods and other invertebrates. The fish is known to move from a more crustacean dominated diet as a juvenile to a nearly completely fish dominated diet as an adult. Sexual maturity is reached at 42 cm, with spawning occurring in large aggregations occurring at different periods throughout its range, generally between July and March. The bigeye trevally is of moderate importance to fisheries throughout its range, and being of high importance to some artisanal fisheries.

40|$|Dissertação mest., Biologia Marinha, Universidade do Algarve, 2007 Spearfishing in {{the eastern}} african coast is an artisanal fishing {{activity}} with a growing importance in these last few years, relatively to traditional fishing gears. It is usually operated by boat or walking to the fishing grounds located in coral reefs, rocky areas or seagrass beds. In Inhassoro (Inhambane Province, Mozambique) spearfishing is a versatile fishing gear used along with hand line, and targets fish, lobster and sea cucumber. The fishing activity depends on the season {{of the year and}} on the tidal and weather conditions. Spearfishing for fish is mainly active in Sul I, the closest fishing center from the village, where the fishing fleet is motor propelled. The fishing grounds are distributed between the coast line and Bazaruto, from the north of this island to the southern adjacent region of Santa Carolina, a no-take zone of the National Park of Bazaruto Archipelago (PNAB). A high number of species have been identified in the sampled landings, like in many <b>other</b> tropical <b>artisanal</b> fisheries, but only 5 comprise 70 % of the landings - Scarus ghobban (45, 2 %), Diagramma pictum (7, 6 %), Plectorhinchus flavomaculatus (6, 1 %), Epinephelus malabaricus (5, 8 %) and Scomberomorus commerson (5, 0 %). The impact of the fishery is not known and needs to be investigated, but the obtained results suggest that this activity can have detrimental effects on the sequentially hermaphroditic species and in species that use Bazaruto Bay as a breeding ground. Motor boats are found to have higher landings and CPUE, however, the difference in rent relative to sail boats is lower, mainly due to high running costs and to the composition of the landings of sailing boats, which are commercially more valuable. There is a growing interest in the community to control and regulate spearfishing, and setting the lobster’s temporary fishing ban is symptomatic of this concern. However, the institutional arrangements and the different expectations and perceptions of the various groups of stake-holders can weaken the enforcement of locally set regulations...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe main {{political}} {{concern in}} the southern areas of Madagascar is poverty alleviation. To alleviate poverty in the area, the government has chosen to enforce adjustment policies of the World Bank Group. According to the World Bank Group's argument, while artisanal mining is supposed to create significant economic, social and environmental problems, large-scale mining investment results in economic and social prosperity. This paper focuses principally on a re-analysis of the debates regarding the relationship between artisanal and large-scale mining and poverty alleviation in developing countries. Further, the paper offers an alternative viewpoint on these issues based on the example of Madagascar. In the last decade, Madagascar has experienced {{a significant increase in}} mining activity. Towards the end of the 90 s, informal and artisanal mining {{emerged as one of the}} most important economic activities of the area with the development of the Ilakaka frontier. At the same time, foreign investments began to benefit from adjustment policies implemented by the government, and large-scale mining operations also commenced. As the local socio-economic system was deeply affected by these developments, it is wise to monitor the effects of each type of mining operation on poverty alleviation. On the one hand, it appears that governance insufficiency has hampered possibilities for broader economic prosperity through large-scale mining investments. On the <b>other</b> hand, while <b>artisanal</b> mining is frequently condemned by scholars, the negative comments seem to be overly pessimistic, as this activity can be demonstrated to provide considerable economic opportunities for both the native and migrant populations...|$|R

40|$|The loss of {{marketing}} boards Cue: The scrapping of commodity marketing boards, that once supplied farming inputs and bought farmers produce at fixed prices, {{has been a}} common aspect of economic liberalisation in the developing world. Governments have, in effect, been forced to take a hands-off approach to agriculture. Sadly, in many areas {{this has led to}} a decline in farming profits, and the migration of young people to urban areas. Many end up doing menial jobs that do little to boost either the national economy or their own family?s income. Reversing this trend is far from easy, and some economists suggest that without external support, rural communities will continue to struggle. The speaker in our next report certainly agrees with this view. Victor Okorua is an agricultural economist at the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Agriculture. Over the years he has monitored how the abolishing of commodity marketing boards has affected farmers. Tunde Fatunde asked him to explain how farmers have been affected by the loss of just one, Nigeria?s Cocoa Marketing Board. IN:		?In the western part of Nigeria ? OUT:		?agriculture is no more drudgery. ? DUR?N	 3 ? 26 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Victor Okorua suggesting the kinds of support Nigeria?s agriculture will need if it is to thrive under a new generation of young farmers. Transcript Fatunde	In the western part of Nigeria, cocoa is the most important commodity. Now with the scrapping of the Cocoa Commodity Board for quite some time, what effect has this had on farmers? Okorua	First there is the issue of the price, which farmers used to enjoy; a steady price which brought about a steady income. Now with the scrapping of the board, this is no longer in place, and so farmers? income is affected. Fatunde	Has this led to an increase in the purchasing power of the farmers? Okorua	When the boards were scrapped, initially there was a boom in the market, because the multi-nationals came in, agencies came in, middlemen came in, and farmers had the price the world market was operating with, and so returns were higher. But over time there has been a problem. We have had a glut {{as a result of the}} adulteration of the produce, and then the world market not importing our produce as expected, and this has led to glut. And so the returns to farmers have begun to dwindle, and this has made farmers begin to leave their plantations for other alternatives. Fatunde	What kind of alternatives? Okorua	Well with the older ones, they found an alternative by going back to arable cropping, to make sure that the family is sustained. <b>Others</b> engaged in <b>artisanal</b> jobs. Then the younger ones migrated to the urban centres. They took up jobs like gardening, like security agencies, and other kind of jobs which are menial in nature. Fatunde	Which means that there?s a problem. The older farmers are still interested in cocoa production, and the younger ones are not. How is it possible to make sure that the younger ones go back to the land, to continue with cocoa production? Okorua	Here let me say, there?s a need for these boards to come back, that is the commodity boards. And there is a need for the government to subsidise agriculture. There is a need to encourage cottage industry, because we need to diversify beyond just producing the raw material. We need to add value. We have to change the cocoa seed to either powder, butter, wine and things like that, that will have an alternative market. I think with this, many younger ones will be encouraged. Besides there is the issue of infrastructure. Government must put in place roads. They must put in place electricity. They must put in place water, and there must be markets. It is only at this that the younger ones will be encouraged to go back to the rural areas, take up the so-called plantations, and begin to help their older ones. Besides there must be the issue of credit. Credit must be supplied to them, so that they can be able to buy some of the chemicals and the rest that they need. Again, there must be an improvement in technology; technology in the sense that, we no longer have to depend on hoes and cutlasses. There must be improved ways of making sure that agriculture is no more drudgery. End of track. An agricultural economist from the Nigerian Ministry of Agriculture describes the impact of the abolishment of the Cocoa Marketing Board, and recommends that the board should be reinstated and other supports given in order to restore cocoa production and encourage young people to enter the business...|$|R

40|$|Sagalassos is {{an ancient}} Pisidian city, located on a south-facing {{mountain}} slope of the Western Taurus mountains in Southwest Anatolia. The city has been inhabited from Classical to Mid Byzantine times, with Late Hellenistic to Early Byzantine times (2 nd century BC until the 7 th century AD) representing its most intensive period of occupation. Sagalassos {{has been the subject}} of ongoing archaeology-driven research since 1986, first as part of the Pisidia Survey Project and from 1989 onwards as subject of the Sagalassos Archaeological Research Project (SARP). Professor Marc Waelkens directed the project between 1989 and 2013; professor Jeroen Poblome from 2014 onwards. The past decades have provided a treasure of information on the history and layout of Sagalassos and its territory, among which the so-called Potters’ Quarter (now referred to as Eastern Suburbium) northeast of the town. In 2010, professors Jeroen Poblome and Patrick Degryse jointly devised a new research project on the Eastern Suburbium of Sagalassos, a topographically, historically and functionally distinctive suburban development in the immediate periphery of the town of Sagalassos. They envisaged an interdisciplinary research programme that would allow us to map the origins of this ‘peri-urban phenomenon’ and its emerging and decreasing functionalities, to unravel its developing social complexity and to approach the general study area of ancient urbanism from a ‘suburban point of view’. Since the study area also harboured the main artisanal quarter of the city, it was expected to hold potential for the documentation of the area’s importance within the regional economy. The main modules for this thesis consisted of the various, mostly unpublished, excavation and survey data from previous campaigns, augmented with new research data (2011 - 2014) collected within the area aimed at answering specific (open) research questions. Because of its location on a high plateau northeast of the city, the Eastern Suburbium is an area that is topographically segregated from both the rest of the town as well as from its surrounding territory. The suburban setting and topographical characteristics of the area resulted into the formation of a suburban texture that is clearly distinguishable in its historical development, layout and attested functionalities. A quarter century of research had yielded a lot of information on this site, but a thorough study of its many facets was still lacking. This project therefore aimed at gathering all available data, filling the remaining knowledge gaps with additional field work, identifying the nature of this suburban ‘phenomenon’ and presenting the data of all previous, current and ongoing research in an integrated, exhaustive and accessible manner. Even though the expertise on the Eastern Suburbium was already considerable due to the varied results from previous campaigns, the first major task consisted of combining all available, but fragmented, old and new data into a comprehensive history of the study area. This approach also led to a reassessment and ultimately to a reinterpretation of our knowledge on all historical and functional aspects of the various sites throughout the Eastern Suburbium. From Hellenistic times onwards the area overlaps to a large extent with the Eastern Necropolis, but the burial practices are mainly concentrated along the steeper, rocky slopes surrounding the area. The central part of the area would develop, from Augustan times onwards, into the main artisanal quarter of the city. Until now only pottery production activities have been conclusively attested within the Eastern Suburbium, but the presence of other crafts (glass working, metallurgy, textile dying, etc.) has been suggested. Specific zones within and in the immediate surroundings of the study area were also used for clay quarrying (the Central Depression), for stone quarrying (the largest eastern quarry is located in the southeast of the Eastern Suburbium) and sarcophagus carving (immediately south of the Central Depression). Finally, the southwestern quarter of the area was taken up between c. 50 AD and c. 350 AD by a series of (semi-) public structures and complexes. Communal dining has been attested at the PQ 2 site, which is tentatively identified as a schola, and we hypothesise the identification of the site G complex as a multi-purpose suburban campus, where for example cattle markets and festivals could be organised. Even though the area covers a geographically distinguishable terrain, the area forms part of the continentia aedificia (the continuously built-up sprawl outside the city walls). In a more broad sense we can refer to the study region as a proasteion (mainly used in the Greek East) or suburbium (mainly used in the Latin West). The problem with these terms is that both also refer to the wider area surrounding an ancient city, including the part of the countryside defined by (elite) villae and suburban farms. This study further recognises a complex framework of different interacting ‘levels of urbanisation’, ranging from the monumental city centre to the desolate mountain slopes, with many different, though partially permeable, levels in between. While the boundaries between these zones were never definite, they appear to increasingly dissolve from Late Roman times onwards. The 7 th century AD earthquake would signify a breaking point for the urban texture in the centre of the city, but it appears that the Eastern Suburbium was already to a large extent abandoned in the preceding century. The demise of the quarter was the end station of a longer process, which included, consecutively, the gradual accumulation of waste, the abandonment of the (semi-) public southwestern quarter, the usurpation of older burial monuments, the dismantlement of derelict structures, the return of agricultural and pastoral activities in the area and the removal of the potting activities to a yet unknown location in the countryside. The final major intervention within the proasteion was the erection of an Early Byzantine church on the top of the eastern ridge, but also this building appears to have been emptied before it eventually collapsed in the 7 th century AD. The history of this quarter could be reconstructed in some detail from Classical/Hellenistic times to the so-called ‘Dark Ages’, thus covering a period of more than 1, 000 years. This study will hopefully serve as the onset for future research, as some (socio-economic) aspects deserve a more thorough approach.
