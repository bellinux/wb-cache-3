40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to analyze the influence of spray mixture volume and flight height on herbicide deposition in aerial applications on pastures. The experimental plots were arranged in a pasture area in the district of Porto Esperidião (Mato Grosso, Brazil). In all of the treatments, the applications contained the herbicides aminopyralid and fluroxypyr (Dominum) at the dose of 2. 5 L c. p. ha- 1, including the adjuvant mineral <b>oil</b> (<b>Joint</b> Oil) at the dose of 1. 0 L and a tracer to determine the deposition by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (rhodamine at a concentration of 0. 6 %). The experiment consisted of nine treatments that comprised the combinations of three spray volumes (20, 30 and 50 L ha- 1) and three flight heights (10, 30 and 40 m). The results showed that, on average, there was a tendency for larger deposits for the smallest flight heights, with a significant difference between the heights of 10 and 40 m. There was no significant difference among the deposits obtained with the different spray mixture volumes...|$|E
40|$|O uso de {{glyphosate}} para o controle de plantas daninhas em soja RR® apresenta características essenciais no conceito de praticabilidade. Entretanto, apesar de não permitido na legislação brasileira, tem-se aumentado a associação com outros herbicidas para {{manejo de}} espécies de difícil controle, assim como a sua mistura em tanque em combinação com inseticidas e adjuvantes. Com o objetivo de avaliar a seletividade de cultivares de soja RR® submetidos a misturas em tanque de formulações de glyphosate (Polaris®, Roundup Ready® e Roundup WG®) com chlorimuron-ethyl (Classic®), e suas associações com óleo mineral (Joint Oil®) e inseticidas novaluron (Gallaxy 100 EC®), permethrin (Piredan®) e methomyl (Lannate BR®), um experimento foi conduzido a campo na cidade de Maracaí-SP, na safra 2006 / 2007. O delineamento experimental utilizado foi o de blocos ao acaso, com quatro repetições, em esquema fatorial 16 x 4, sendo 16 as associações das misturas em tanque entre as formulações de glyphosate, óleo mineral e inseticidas e quatro cultivares: Monsoy 7210 RR®, Monsoy 7979 RR®, BRS 245 RR® e CD 214 RR®. Sintomas visuais de intoxicação inicial dos cultivares estudados foram caracterizados por clorose e encarquilhamento nas folhas para todas as misturas em tanque das formulações de glyphosate + chlorimuron-ethyl, associadas ou não ao óleo mineral e inseticidas novaluron, permethrin e methomyl. Todas as misturas em tanque não promoveram reduções significativas de produtividade para os cultivares Monsoy 7210 RR®, Monsoy 7979 RR® e BRS 245 RR® e controlaram Ipomoea spp. com eficácia apenas satisfatória a partir dos 21 DAA (dias após aplicação). The use of glyphosate for weed control in soybean RR® presents essential practical characteristics. However, although not {{allowed by the}} current Brazilian legislation, the association with other herbicides has been increasing for species of difficult control, {{as well as the}} use of tank mixtures combined with insecticides and adjuvants. Aiming to evaluate the selectivity of soybean RR® genotypes submitted to tank mixtures of the glyphosate formulations (Polaris®, Roundup Ready® and Roundup WG®) with chlorimuron-ethyl (Classic®), and their associations with mineral <b>oil</b> (<b>Joint</b> Oil®) and novaluron insecticides (Gallaxy 100 EC®), permethrin (Piredan®) and methomyl (Lannate BR®), an experiment was conducted under field conditions at Maracai -São Paulo, during the 2006 / 2007 growing year. The experiment was arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replications, in a factorial scheme 16 x 4, with 16 representing the tank mixture associations of glyphosate formulations, mineral oil and insecticide, and the four genotypes Monsoy 7210 RR®, Monsoy 7979 RR®, BRS 245 RR® and CD 214 RR®. Visual symptoms of initial intoxication in the genotypes studied were characterized by chlorosis and wrinkle in the leaves for all tank mixtures of glyphosate + chlorimuron-ethyl, associated or not with mineral oil, and novaluron, permethrin and methomyl insecticides. None of the tank mixtures promoted significant yield reductions for Monsoy 7210 RR®, Monsoy 7979 RR® and BRS 245 RR® genotypes, and controlled Ipomoea spp with satisfactory effectiveness, starting from 21 DAA (days after application) ...|$|E

30|$|One {{of the few}} {{solutions}} {{suggested to}} Iran to prevent this wasteful migration was for both countries to start operating the <b>joint</b> <b>oil</b> fields simultaneously (Mehr News 2010). But even this solution will probably {{not be able to}} resolve the issue completely. If there are several operators for a <b>joint</b> <b>oil</b> field, each would try to reach the highest production rate of oil in the shortest time possible. Under such circumstances, since the main focus is on maximizing production, the maintenance of the oil field and production optimization would at least be partly disregarded. Such a policy would damage the entire field {{to the point where the}} interests of all the parties are harmed (Mehr News 2010). In January 2011, the two countries announced that in order to increase their crude output, they have reached an agreement to develop <b>joint</b> <b>oil</b> fields on border areas (Press TV News 2012 b). If they both exploit the fields with an equal and reasonable extraction rate which is less than the maximum rate possible, the conditions of the fields are monitored more accurately; thus, the long-term benefits of proper maintenance of the fields exceed the revenue losses from extracting less than maximum.|$|R
