A popular algorithm for {{registration of}} 3 D point sets is the Iterative Closest Point (ICP). With the increase of <b>overlapping</b> <b>ratios,</b> the convergence accuracy and speed of ICP algorithm improves. In most cases of 3 D scanning systems, the overlapping regions of multi-view point sets often locate at the boundaries. Based on this characteristic, a new method for registration of multi-view point sets with low <b>overlapping</b> <b>ratios</b> is proposed. Firstly, two kinds of sampling strategies are introduced, and {{a great number of}} point pairs are constructed. Through surface classification, curvature and neighborhood curvature matching of point pairs, the overlapping regions are selected. Then a Levenberg-Marquardt ICP (LM-ICP) method is used to search optimal registration parameters with the points in the overlapping regions. Finally, experiments for registration of multi-view point sets are performed, and results show that the method can get good registration accuracy for point sets with low <b>overlapping</b> <b>ratios...</b>|$|R

The authors first performed a series of wind tunnel investigations on semi-cylindrical three-bladed Savonius rotor scale models with different overlap ratios and without overlap. These experiments were conducted in front of a low-speed subsonic wind tunnel at different Reynolds numbers. Pressures around the concave and convex surfaces of each blade, as well as the static torque for the rotor models, were measured. Using these experimental data, the authors calculated aerodynamic characteristics such as drag coefficients, static torque coefficients, and power coefficients. The authors then performed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations using the commercial CFD software FLUENT and GAMBIT to analyze the static rotor aerodynamics of those models. The experimental and computational results were then compared for verification. Three different models with different overlap ratios were designed and fabricated for the current study to find the effect of overlap ratios. The results from the experimental part of the research show a significant effect of <b>overlap</b> <b>ratio</b> and Reynolds number on the improvement of aerodynamic performance of the Savonius wind turbine. At higher Reynolds number, the turbine model without <b>overlap</b> <b>ratio</b> gives better aerodynamic coefficients, and at lower Reynolds number, the model with moderate <b>overlap</b> <b>ratio</b> gives better results.|$|E
