5|$|After {{menstruation}} {{and directly}} under the influence <b>of</b> <b>estrogen,</b> the cervix undergoes a series of changes in position and texture. During most of the menstrual cycle, the cervix remains firm, and is positioned low and closed. However, as ovulation approaches, the cervix becomes softer and rises to open {{in response to the}} higher levels <b>of</b> <b>estrogen</b> present. These changes are also accompanied by changes in cervical mucus, described below.|$|E
5|$|In early pregnancy, levels <b>of</b> <b>estrogen,</b> progesterone, {{estradiol}} increase, {{leading to}} breast growth {{in preparation for}} lactation. It has been hypothesized that if this process is interrupted by an abortionbefore full maturity (differentiation) in the third trimesterthen more immature cells could be left than there were prior to the pregnancy. These immature cells could then be exposed to carcinogens and hormones over time, resulting in a greater potential risk of breast cancer. This mechanism was first proposed and explored in rat studies conducted in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Risk {{factors for}} endometrial cancer include obesity, {{diabetes}} mellitus, breast cancer, use of tamoxifen, never {{having had a}} child, late menopause, high levels <b>of</b> <b>estrogen,</b> and increasing age. Immigration studies (migration studies), which examine the change in cancer risk in populations moving between countries with different rates of cancer, {{show that there is}} some environmental component to endometrial cancer. These environmental risk factors are not well characterized.|$|E
40|$|Estrogens (female sex hormones) are {{important}} sex hormones {{for women and}} men, although traditionally {{the problems associated with}} impaired synthesis and metabolism <b>of</b> <b>estrogens</b> are considered, especially in relation to the female population. However, presented an overview allows for a different look at the role and significance <b>of</b> <b>estrogens</b> for men.

25|$|Both {{females and}} males develop breasts from the same embryological tissues.

40|$|Gender {{specific}} {{differences in}} cardiovascular disease are largely mediated by sex hormones. The use <b>of</b> <b>estrogens</b> significantly reduces the overall incidence {{of heart disease}} in postmenopausal women. Beneficial effects <b>of</b> <b>estrogens</b> on plasma lipoprotein levels are clearly established. However, these do not explain the magnitude of risk reduction seen in clinical studies. Thus additional and currently unknown functions <b>of</b> <b>estrogens</b> must be operative. Elucidation <b>of</b> the exact <b>estrogen</b> action in the heart will have important implications {{in the treatment of}} cardiovascular disease. It will probably enhance the therapeutic repertoire in treating heart disease, {{the most common cause of}} death in industrialized countries. We will review the current understanding of the function <b>of</b> <b>estrogens</b> in the heart and discuss potential strategies on how to apply these data to clinical practice...|$|R
5|$|The {{effect on}} sexual desire is varied, with {{increase}} or decrease in some but with no effect in most. Combined oral contraceptives {{reduce the risk of}} ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer and do not change the risk of breast cancer. They often reduce menstrual bleeding and painful menstruation cramps. The lower doses <b>of</b> <b>estrogen</b> released from the vaginal ring may reduce the risk of breast tenderness, nausea, and headache associated with higher dose estrogen products.|$|E
5|$|The female hormone estrogen, {{when used}} in the {{combined}} oral contraceptive pill and in perimenopausal hormone replacement therapy, {{has been associated with}} a two- to sixfold increased risk of venous thrombosis. The risk depends on the type of hormones used, the dose <b>of</b> <b>estrogen,</b> and the presence of other thrombophilic risk factors. Various mechanisms, such as deficiency of protein S and tissue factor pathway inhibitor, are said to be responsible.|$|E
5|$|While {{some forms}} of birth control do not affect the menstrual cycle, {{hormonal}} contraceptives work by disrupting it. Progestogen negative feedback decreases the pulse frequency of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release by the hypothalamus, which decreases the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) by the anterior pituitary. Decreased levels of FSH inhibit follicular development, preventing an increase in estradiol levels. Progestogen negative feedback and the lack <b>of</b> <b>estrogen</b> positive feedback on LH release prevent a mid-cycle LH surge. Inhibition of follicular development {{and the absence of}} a LH surge prevent ovulation.|$|E
40|$|Context: Because androgens are {{obligatory}} precursors <b>of</b> <b>estrogens,</b> it {{is reasonable}} to assume that their serum concentrations would exhibit positive correlations. If so, then epidemiologic studies that examine the association between androgens and pathological processes should adjust the results for the independent effect <b>of</b> <b>estrogens...</b>|$|R

5|$|While the {{mutagenic}} and genotoxic {{effects of}} TCDD are sometimes disputed and sometimes confirmed it does foster {{the development of}} cancer. Its main action in causing cancer is cancer promotion; it promotes the carcinogenicity initiated by other compounds. Very high doses may, in addition, cause cancer indirectly; one of the proposed mechanisms is oxidative stress and the subsequent oxygen damage to DNA. There are other explanations such as endocrine disruption or altered signal transduction. The endocrine disrupting activities seem {{to be dependent on}} life stage, being anti-estrogenic when estrogen is present (or in high concentration) in the body, and estrogenic in the absence <b>of</b> <b>estrogen.</b>|$|E
5|$|Smoking {{and the use}} of {{progestin}} {{are both}} protective against endometrial cancer. Smoking provides protection by altering the metabolism <b>of</b> <b>estrogen</b> and promoting weight loss and early menopause. This protective effect lasts long after smoking is stopped. Progestin is present in the combined oral contraceptive pill and the hormonal intrauterine device (IUD). Combined oral contraceptives reduce risk more the longer they are taken: by 56% after four years, 67% after eight years, and 72% after twelve years. This risk reduction continues for at least fifteen years after contraceptive use has been stopped. Obese women may need higher doses of progestin to be protected. Having had more than fiveinfants (grand multiparity) is also a protective factor, and having at least one child reduces the risk by 35%. Breastfeeding for more than 18months reduces risk by 23%. Increased physical activity reduces an individual's risk by 38–46%. There is preliminary evidence that consumption of soy is protective.|$|E
5|$|The luteal {{phase is}} {{the final phase of}} the ovarian cycle and it {{corresponds}} to the secretory phase of the uterine cycle. During the luteal phase, the pituitary hormones FSH and LH cause the remaining parts of the dominant follicle to transform into the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone. The increased progesterone in the adrenals starts to induce the production <b>of</b> <b>estrogen.</b> The hormones produced by the corpus luteum also suppress production of the FSH and LH that the corpus luteum needs to maintain itself. Consequently, the level of FSH and LH fall quickly over time, and the corpus luteum subsequently atrophies. Falling levels of progesterone trigger menstruation {{and the beginning of the}} next cycle. From the time of ovulation until progesterone withdrawal has caused menstruation to begin, the process typically takes about two weeks, with 14 days considered normal. For an individual woman, the follicular phase often varies in length from cycle to cycle; by contrast, the length of her luteal phase will be fairly consistent from cycle to cycle.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the effects <b>of</b> <b>estrogens</b> on glucose homeostasis using the Aromatase Knockout (ArKO) mouse, which {{is unable to}} convert androgens into estrogens. The ArKO mouse is a model <b>of</b> total <b>estrogen</b> ablation which develops symptoms of metabolic syndrome. To determine the development and progression of whole body state of insulin resistance of ArKO mice, comprehensive whole body tolerance tests were performed on WT, ArKO and estrogen administrated mice at 3 and 12 months of age. The absence <b>of</b> <b>estrogens</b> in the male ArKO mice leads to hepatic insulin resistance, glucose and pyruvate intolerance from 3 to 12 months with consistent improvement upon estrogen treatment. Estrogen absence in the female ArKO mice leads to glucose intolerance without pyruvate intolerance or insulin resistance. The replacement <b>of</b> <b>estrogens</b> in the female WT and ArKO mice exhibited both insulin sensitizing and resistance effects depending on age and dosage. In conclusion, this study presents information on the sexually dimorphic roles <b>of</b> <b>estrogens</b> on glucose homeostasis regulation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe effects <b>of</b> <b>estrogens</b> are pleiotropic, {{affecting}} multiple bodily systems. Changes {{from the}} body’s natural fluctuating levels <b>of</b> <b>estrogens,</b> through surgical {{removal of the}} ovaries, natural menopause, or the administration <b>of</b> exogenous <b>estrogens</b> to menopausal women have been independently linked to an altered immune profile, and changes to cognitive processes. Here, we propose that inflammation may mediate the relationship between low levels <b>of</b> <b>estrogens</b> and cognitive decline. In order {{to determine what is}} known about this connection, we review the literature on the cognitive effects <b>of</b> decreased <b>estrogens</b> due to oophorectomy or natural menopause, decreased estrogens’ role on inflammation – both peripherally and in the brain – and the relationship between inflammation and cognition. While this review demonstrates that much is unknown about the intersection between estrogens, cognition, inflammation, we propose that there is an important interaction between these literatures...|$|R

50|$|Mepartricin is {{estrogen}} reabsorption inhibitor {{that may}} interfere with the reabsorption <b>of</b> <b>estrogens</b> in the gut leading to increased fecal estrogen excretion. It reduces 17 β estradiol concentration in enterohepatic circulation and decreases estrogen levels in the prostate. The effect of mepartricin on the reabsorption <b>of</b> <b>estrogens</b> was evaluated in studies in vitro and in vivo.|$|R
40|$|Increased local {{concentrations}} <b>of</b> <b>estrogens</b> are {{a well-known}} {{risk factor for}} endometrial cancer. Estrogens can act as mitogens via the estrogen receptors, and by forming oxidative metabolites they can act as cancer initiators. The role <b>of</b> <b>estrogens</b> differs with {{the stage of the}} disease. In pre-cancerous endometrium, estrogens are converted into estrogen quinones, which are potent carcinogens and can act as cancer initiators. Estrogen quinones can react with DNA and cause DNA depurination. They are also involved in the formation of reactive oxygen species, which can additionally damage DNA and other cellular macromolecules. In fully developed cancers, the role <b>of</b> <b>estrogens</b> is mainly to stimulate cell proliferation and to inhibit apoptosis, which also increases the occurrence of random errors in DNA replication. Estrogen actions are regulated at the receptor level {{as well as at the}} levels <b>of</b> the <b>estrogen</b> biosynthesizing and metabolizing enzymes. These latter represent potential targets for the development of new therapeutics, while the oxidative metabolites <b>of</b> <b>estrogens</b> can serve as biomarkers for diagnosis and monitoring of endometrial cancer...|$|R
40|$|Gynecomastia, {{cutaneous}} spider nevi, testicular atrophy, {{and loss}} of libido are frequently found in men with chronic liver disease. The clinical aspects of the subject have recently been reviewed (1). On the basis of studies <b>of</b> urinary <b>estrogen</b> excretion (2), these changes {{have been attributed to}} increased levels <b>of</b> <b>estrogens,</b> particularly un-conjugated estrogens presumably resulting from decreased conjugation in the diseased liver. This presumption is based on abundant evidence indi-cating that the liver of certain laboratory ani-mals may "inactivate " estrogens (3), and that Figure 1 shows in diagrammatic fashion some of the factors usually considered in the produc-tion and metabolism <b>of</b> <b>estrogens</b> in man. Several authors (3, 8 - 10) have recently reviewed the me-tabolism <b>of</b> <b>estrogens,</b> therefore the large amount of data supporting this scheme need not be cited here.

25|$|Sex {{drive is}} {{dependent}} on androgen levels only in the presence <b>of</b> <b>estrogen,</b> but without estrogen, free testosterone level actually decreases sexual desire (instead of increases sex drive), as demonstrated for those women who have hypoactive sexual desire disorder, and the sexual desire in these women can be restored by administration <b>of</b> <b>estrogen</b> (using oral contraceptive).

40|$|In {{addition}} to exerting genomic actions via nuclear receptors within hours to days, estrogens also regulate neuronal activity much faster (within seconds) by activating neuronal membrane receptors coupled to intracellular second-messenger pathways. To date, the origin <b>of</b> <b>estrogens</b> inducing rapid {{effects in the}} brain remains unclear, although it is often ascribed to the gonads.
