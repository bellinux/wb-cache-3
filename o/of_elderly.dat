40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the gait pattern <b>of</b> the <b>elderly</b> with aging and to analyze the elderly’s gait changes by the focal tendon vibratory stimulation.

Using 3 D motion analysis, we analyzed that difference between the elderly gait and young adults gait and the changes <b>of</b> the <b>elderly</b> gait by applying focal vibratory stimuli. As a result, specifically in the early stance, the elderly’s gait was more flexed and the lower extremity extensors <b>of</b> the <b>elderly</b> worked harder. When the focal vibratory stimuli were applied, joint angle <b>of</b> the <b>elderly</b> was induced to that of the young adults. There was a reduction in demands for supporting bodies and progressing gait in the stance phase. This means that focal vibratory stimuli affect the gait <b>of</b> the <b>elderly.</b> Also, the changes of the gait <b>of</b> the <b>elderly</b> varied according to the characteristics of the focal vibratory stimuli.

Out of the 122 Serbian Orthodox churches in the area, one was destroyed and 17 were damaged, but most of the damage to the churches occurred prior to the Serb retreat. HRW also reported that the vast majority of the abuses during Operation Storm were committed by Croatian forces. These abuses, which continued on a large scale for months afterward, included summary executions <b>of</b> <b>elderly</b> and infirm Serbs who remained behind and the wholesale burning and destruction of Serb villages and property.

On the topic of the Internet's effect on reading skills, Guinevere F.

Carr believed that the effect of the Internet on cognition was detrimental, weakening the ability to concentrate and contemplate. Olds cited the potential benefits of computer software that specifically targets learning disabilities, stating that among some neuroscientists {{there was a}} belief that neuroplasticity-based software was beneficial in improving receptive language disorders. Olds mentioned neuroscientist Michael Merzenich, who had formed several companies with his peers in which neuroplasticity-based computer programs had been developed to improve the cognitive functioning of kids, adults and the elderly. In 1996, Merzenich and his peers had started a company called Scientific Learning in which neuroplastic research had been used to develop a computer training program called Fast ForWord that offered seven brain exercises that improved language impairments and learning disabilities in children. Feedback on Fast ForWord showed that these brain exercises even had benefits for autistic children, an unexpected spillover effect that Merzenich has attempted to harness by developing a modification of Fast ForWord specifically designed for autism. At a subsequent company that Merzenich started called Posit Science, Fast ForWord-like brain exercises and other techniques were developed with the aim of sharpening the brains <b>of</b> <b>elderly</b> people by retaining the plasticity of their brains.|$|E

He subsequently produced a sensationalist popular history of witchcraft, The Dark World of Witches (1962), in which he repeated many of the claims regarding Pickingill.
