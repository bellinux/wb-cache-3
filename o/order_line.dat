Although in principle there can be different types of broken phases, corresponding perturbatively to unbroken SU(2) ×U(1) or U(1) ×U(1) symmetries, we find that dynamically only the broken phase with SU(2) ×U(1) -like properties is realized.

In particular, we explicitly show that the appearance of a new critical point associated with a first <b>order</b> <b>line</b> at high temperature and low densities could help to conciliate some lattice results with model predictions. Using different techniques, we perform an extensive thermodynamical analysis to understand the physical nature of the different critical points.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we compare two {{inventory}} replenishment strategies for retailers and evaluate {{their effect on}} service levels, average inventory {{and the number of}} <b>order</b> <b>lines.</b> The first inventory replenishment strategy we consider is the Full Service strategy which is currently applied by many retailers and orders at a review period if either a case pack fits onto the shelves or the minimum reorder level is reached. This strategy is compared to an Efficient Full Service strategy where an order is placed only if at areview period the inventory position drops below the minimum reorder level; then as many case packs are ordered as possible taking into account the limited shelf space. This modified strategy will be compared with the current strategy. We will derive approximations for the key performance indicators and use simulation based on empirical data for thousands of SKU’s at multiple stores from a European retailer to quantify the improvement potential of the new strategy and to evaluate our approximations. The results show that, on average, inventory can be reduced with 22 % and the number of handled <b>order</b> <b>lines</b> can be reduced with 17 % when applying the Efficient Full Service strategy, while guaranteeing the same target customer service level. The approximations for the average inventory and the number of <b>order</b> <b>lines</b> perform very well at the store level and perform well at the SKU level. We also show that these approximations can be used as good indicators for the improvement potential of the new replenishment strategy...|$|R

40|$|We study a {{strongly}} coupled Z_ 2 lattice gauge theory with two flavors of quarks, invariant under an exact SU(2) ×SU(2) ×U_A(1) ×U_B(1) symmetry {{which is the}} same as QCD with two flavors of quarks without an anomaly. The model also contains a coupling {{that can be used to}} break the U_A(1) symmetry and thus mimic the QCD anomaly. At low temperatures T and small baryon chemical potential μ_B the model contains massless pions and massive bosonic baryons similar to QCD with an even number of colors. In this work we study the T-μ_B phase diagram of the model and show that it contains three phases : (1) A chirally broken phase at low T and μ_B, (2) a chirally symmetric baryon superfluid phase at low T and high μ_B, and (3) a symmetric phase at high T. We find that the nature of the finite temperature chiral phase transition and in particular the location of the tricritical point that seperates the first <b>order</b> <b>line</b> from the second <b>order</b> <b>line</b> is affected significantly by the anomaly.
