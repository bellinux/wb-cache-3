5|$|CMDCM {{insignia}} {{are similar}} to the insignia for Master Chief, except that the rating symbol is replaced by an inverted five-point star, reflecting a change in their rating from their previous rating (i.e., MMCM) to CMDCM. The stars for Command Master Chief are silver, while stars for Fleet <b>or</b> <b>Force</b> Master Chief are gold. Additionally, CMDCMs wear a badge, worn on their left breast pocket, denoting their title (Command/Fleet/Force).|$|E
5|$|Even {{before her}} launch, there was {{considerable}} discussion of Tritons role beyond her radar picket mission. An internal Navy memorandum set forth four options for the submarine's extended use. These included configuration {{to serve as a}} command ship (SSCN) for a fleet <b>or</b> <b>force</b> commander, an advanced sonar scout for the fleet, a Regulus missile submarine (SSGN), or a minelaying submarine. However, {{with the exception of the}} command ship option, all of these proposed configurations required extensive modification of her original design.|$|E

5|$|To {{experience}} a detailed {{model of a}} large empire, 4X games are designed with {{a complex set of}} game rules. For example, the player's productivity may be limited by pollution. Players may need to balance a budget, such as managing debt, or paying down maintenance costs. 4X games often model political challenges such as civil disorder, or a senate that can oust the player's political party <b>or</b> <b>force</b> them to make peace.|$|E
5|$|During the search, it is {{revealed}} that Orochimaru wishes to train Sasuke {{because of his}} powerful genetic heritage, the Sharingan. After Sasuke attempts and fails to kill his older brother Itachi {{when he showed up}} in Konoha to kidnap Naruto, he joins Orochimaru, hoping to gain from him the strength needed to kill Itachi. When Tsunade finds out, she sends a group of ninja, including Naruto, to retrieve Sasuke, but Naruto is unable to persuade <b>or</b> <b>force</b> him to come back. Naruto and Sakura do not give up on Sasuke: Naruto leaves Konoha to receive training from Jiraiya to prepare himself for the next time he encounters Sasuke, while Sakura becomes Tsunade's apprentice.|$|E
5|$|Innis {{examined}} {{the rise and}} fall of ancient empires as a way of tracing the effects of communications media. He looked at media that led to the growth of an empire; those that sustained it during its periods of success, and then, the communications changes that hastened an empire's collapse. He tried to show that media 'biases' toward time or space affected the complex interrelationships needed to sustain an empire. These interrelationships included the partnership between the knowledge (and ideas) necessary to create and maintain an empire, and the power (<b>or</b> <b>force)</b> required to expand and defend it. For Innis, the interplay between knowledge and power was always a crucial factor in understanding empire.|$|E

5|$|Some large shark species, such as {{the tiger}} shark, the dusky shark, the great white shark and the bull shark, prey on the {{bottlenose}} dolphin, especially calves. The bottlenose dolphin is capable of defending itself by charging the predator; dolphin 'mobbing' behavior of sharks can occasionally prove fatal for the shark. Targeting a single adult dolphin can be dangerous for a shark of similar size. Killer whale populations in New Zealand and Peru have been observed preying on bottlenose dolphins, but this seems rare, and other orcas may swim with dolphins. Swimming in pods allows dolphins to better defend themselves against predators. Bottlenose dolphins either use complex evasive strategies to outswim their predators, or mobbing techniques to batter the predator to death <b>or</b> <b>force</b> it to flee.|$|E
5|$|Takanohana was the {{youngest}} ever {{to reach the top}} division at just 17, and he set a number of other age-related records. He had a solid but aggressive style, looking to get a right hand grip on his opponents' mawashi and move them quickly out of the ring. He won over half his bouts by a straightforward yori-kiri, <b>or</b> <b>force</b> out. In his later career he suffered increasingly from injuries, and he retired in January 2003 at the age of 30. He is now the head coach of Takanohana stable and {{a senior member of the}} Japan Sumo Association.|$|E
5|$|Coffee shop {{employees}} {{who witnessed the}} shooting identified Clemmons as the shooter {{from a series of}} photos. Authorities sought him in what was considered one of the biggest manhunts the Seattle-Tacoma area had ever seen, and Clemmons was considered the most wanted man in the Pacific Northwest. Authorities also surrounded the homes of Clemmons' friends and family in order to prevent him from finding shelter, and to determine who was helping him. A relative learned that Clemmons was coming to her home in the Leschi neighborhood in Seattle, informed the police and fled. Police locked down the house for 11 hours in the early morning of November 30, believing Clemmons to be holed up inside. After several attempts to coax <b>or</b> <b>force</b> him out of the house, including use of a robot and flashbang grenades, police entered and discovered Clemmons was not inside. Later that day, police searched multiple locations in the Seattle and Tacoma areas, including a park where they found a handgun carried by Clemmons and his pickup truck, which had blood stains inside.|$|E

5|$|For {{the main}} event, the CMLL ring crew quickly erected a 15-foot tall steel cage {{around the ring}} as the {{participants}} were introduced. The match {{started out with a}} 10-minute period where no one would be allowed to leave the cage, forcing the two Infernales squads to fight each other. When the 10 minutes were up Tarzan Boy was quick to climb up the cage and over the top, escaping while everyone else was fighting. Moments later he was joined by teammate Rey Bucanero. Mephisto was the first to escape the cage for his team, leaving four men in the ring. Moments later both Último Guerrero and Averno climbed out of the cage. This left El Satánico to fight Máscara Mágica where the only way to win was to pin their opponent <b>or</b> <b>force</b> them to submit. In the end, the veteran Satánico forced his masked opponent to submit to win the match and the Los Infernales name. Afterwards Máscara Mágica removed his mask per the Lucha de Apuestas stipulations and revealed his birth name, Antonio Gómez Medina, formerly known as Talismán Jr.|$|E
5|$|For {{the second}} match, Fuerza Guerrera was {{designated}} {{the captain of}} the rudo team while Heavy Metal served as {{the captain of the}} tecnico team. To win the match, a team would either pin <b>or</b> <b>force</b> the captain to submit, or pin both of the other team members. The two captains started off the match fighting each other before Rey Misterio Jr. and Psicosis quickly took over. Under the Lucha Libre rules, a tag team partner can enter the ring when the other wrestler tags out or leaves the ring, unlike normal tag team rules. At one point, Rey Misterio Jr. threw Psicosis to the outside; Psicosis then ran away from ringside to avoid falling victim to a diving attack from his opponent. Moments later, Madonna's Boyfriend entered the ring and used his superior size to throw Rey Misterio Jr. around before Latin Lover took over for him. After about 10 more minutes of wrestling, Heavy Metal missed a dive, which Fuerza Guerrera took advantage of by locking in an arm submission hold that quickly caused Heavy Metal to tap out. In Lucha Libre, submissions quickly end the first or second fall, but in this case, the end came off so quickly that the announcers questioned if this had turned into a best-of-three falls match. This was one clear example of how plans had changed from three falls to one right before the show.|$|E
5|$|New {{additions}} to the gameplay include the combat grapple, a ranged-grab maneuver which, depending on the weapon, can pull Kratos towards foes <b>or</b> <b>force</b> them away—necessary at certain points in the game, with Kratos riding harpies across chasms—and a simple grab-with-bare-hands allowing him to use a weak foe as a battering ram. Kratos can now rapidly switch among the four primary weapons in battle, continuing the same attack combination. Other extra features include the addition of ten Godly Possessions, often hidden near defeated foes and providing additional abilities (e.g., unlimited magic) during bonus play. The challenge mode in this game is called the Challenge of Olympus (seven trials) and is unlocked after the game's completion. This mode requires players to complete a series of specific tasks—for example, killing all enemies without using weapons before time runs out. The player may unlock additional rewards, such as bonus costumes for Kratos, behind-the-scenes videos, and concept art of the characters and environments, by completing the game's difficulty levels and the challenge mode. A new mode, the Combat Arena, allows players to set difficulty levels and choose opponents to hone playing skills.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the late Republic, {{formerly}} authoritative institutions lost their credibility and authority. For example, the Sullan reforms to the Senate strongly split the aristocratic class between those who stayed in the city and those who rose to high office abroad, further increasing class divides between Romans, even at the highest levels. Furthermore, the dominance of the military in the late Republic, along with stronger ties between a general and his troops, caused by their longer terms of service together and the troops' reliance on that general to provide for their retirements, along with an obstructionist central government, meant a huge number of malcontent soldiers willing to take up arms against the state. Adding in the institutionalisation of violence as a means to obstruct <b>or</b> <b>force</b> political change (e.g. the deaths of the Gracchi and Sulla's dictatorship, respectively), the Republic was caught in an ever more violent and anarchic struggle between the Senate, assemblies at Rome, and the promagistrates. It would only be resolved by civil war, a war which the promagistrate governors and their troops would win, and in doing so, collapse the Republic.|$|E
5|$|The {{foundations}} of the Pax Mongolica lie in the Mongol Empire beginning with Genghis Khan in the early 13th century. In the process of conquering the various tribes in the region, Genghis Khan revolutionised the way Mongolian tribal society was structured. After each new victory, {{more and more people}} were incorporated under Genghis Khan's rule, thus diversifying the societal balance of the tribe. In 1203, Genghis Khan, in an effort to strengthen his army, ordered a reform that reorganised his army's structure while breaking down the traditional clan- and kindred-based divisions that had previously fragmented the society and military. He arranged his army into arbans (inter-ethnic groups of ten), and the members of an arban were commanded to be loyal to one another regardless of ethnic origin. Ten arbans made a zuun, or a company; ten zuuns made a myangan, or a battalion; and ten myangans formed a tumen, or an army of 10,000. This decimal system organisation of Genghis Khan's strong military would prove very effective in conquering, by persuasion <b>or</b> <b>force,</b> the many tribes of the central Asian steppe, but it would also strengthen Mongol society as a whole. By 1206 Genghis Khan's military expansion had unified the tribes of Mongolia, and in the same year he was elected and acclaimed as the leader of Mongolia.|$|E
