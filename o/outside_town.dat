5|$|Archaeological {{excavation}} – The Classics Department sponsors an excavation at Castel Viscardo, a city near Orvieto in Italy. Faculty {{and students}} from the college are excavating a site that was occupied from the early Etruscan to the late Roman periods. The excavation have yielded many historical and archaeological finds; Saint Anselm College sends over 25 students each summer to the Coriglia excavation, just <b>outside</b> <b>town.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Wakeman School, {{which was}} {{geographically}} the closest {{school to the}} town centre 'loop', next to the English Bridge, was previously called Shrewsbury Technical School, and was attended by the notable First World War poet Wilfred Owen. It closed as part of reorganisation in July 2013. Additionally, two other establishments <b>outside</b> <b>town</b> serve town students – The Corbet School to the north at Baschurch; and Mary Webb School, {{in the village of}} Pontesbury to the south-west.|$|E
5|$|By 1992, York Region {{was moving}} forward with plans to expand Green Lane into a four lane road, while the {{province}} was urged to consider extending Highway404 north to it, and eventually around {{the east side of}} Lake Simcoe. The province studied this and other options over the following years, before a formal announcement was made by Minister of Transportation Tony Clement on 22 June 1998 along with York Region chairman Bill Fisch. The plan called for an extension of Highway404 north to Green Lane, and expansion of Highway9 (now part of York Region Road 31), the western extension of Davis Drive <b>outside</b> <b>town,</b> to five lanes between Highway400 and Bathurst Street. At the time over 20,000 vehicles used Davis Drive on an average day.|$|E

5|$|At {{the edge}} of town, the 55th Regiment {{received}} orders from Mawhood to fall back and join the 40th Regiment in town. The 40th had taken up a position just <b>outside</b> <b>town,</b> {{on the north side}} of a ravine. The 55th formed up to the left of the 40th. The 55th sent a platoon to flank the oncoming Americans, but it was cut to pieces. When Sullivan sent several regiments to scale the ravine, they fell back to a breastwork. After making a brief stand, the British fell back again, some leaving Princeton, and others taking up refuge in Nassau Hall. Alexander Hamilton brought three cannons up and had them blast away at the building. Then some Americans rushed the front door, broke it down, and the British put a white flag outside one of the windows. Exactly 194 British soldiers walked out of the building and laid down their arms.|$|E
5|$|When it was {{decommissioned}} in 1957, M-56 {{started at}} an intersection with US24 (Telegraph Road) {{on the west}} side of Monroe. From there, the trunkline ran southeasterly along Elm Avenue to an intersection with US25 (Dixie Highway, now M-125) in downtown. M-56 also intersected US24A (now Interstate75) just <b>outside</b> <b>town.</b> The highway continued northeasterly past Sterling State Park and along Brest Bay in the communities of Detroit Beach and Woodland Beach. Turning inland near Stony Point, the trunkline followed Dixie Highway across the Swan Creek. North of the creek, Dixie Highway met US Turnpike, and M-56 followed Dixie Highway northward into South Rockwood. In that village, the trunkline turned northeasterly parallel to US24 to cross the Huron River. On the north side of the river, M-56 followed the southernmost end of Fort Street to Huron River Drive, turning northwesterly along the latter road. The highway ran through an intersection with US 24A and parallel to the river into Flat Rock, where it terminated at the intersection with US24/US25 (Telegraph Road, now just US24).|$|E

25|$|The city of Orvieto {{has long}} kept {{the secret of}} its {{labyrinth}} of caves and tunnels that lie beneath the surface. Dug deep into the tuff, a volcanic rock, these secret hidden tunnels are now only open to view through guided tours. Their spectacular nature has also yielded many historical and archeological finds.

25|$|As a last {{witness to}} the former leather industry, the Gerberhaus ("Tanners' House") stands at Löherplatz below the Unionskirche; it is the former storage shed on the Wörsbach. Löherplatz was, {{beginning}} in the Middle Ages {{the place where the}} tanneries and leather processing works were found owing to the demand for water, and also the need to have the works <b>outside</b> <b>town</b> given the attendant stench that went forth from them. The Gerberhaus, after a thorough renovation, nowadays serves as an exhibition and cabaret event venue.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. 35th Infantry {{border post}} had about 15–18 men and {{requested}} reinforcements from their garrison. When they arrived they requested the Buffalo Soldiers of the 10th Cavalry. The 10th, commanded by Frederick Herman, {{came to their}} aid from their camp <b>outside</b> <b>town.</b> After observing the situation for a few moments, Lt. Colonel Herman ordered {{an attack on the}} Mexican and German held hilltops overlooking the border town. Defensive trenches and machine gun placements had been seen being dug there in the previous weeks. Herman wanted Americans there before Mexican reinforcements got there.|$|E
25|$|By July's end, GM 33 {{had been}} repulsed three {{times by the}} PAVN {{defenses}} at Moung Phalane and remained stalled <b>outside</b> <b>town.</b> A week into August, GM 33 was relieved by three battalions of GM 30. There was a week's pause before the assault resumed under close air support from AC-130 gunships. With the Royalist battalions at half strength because of casualties, malaria, and desertions, no progress could be made. On 25 September, Bataillon Guerrier 313 (BG 313) arrived to complete GM 30. One last push by the entire GM 30 regiment then failed, and Operation Phoutah ended its defensive offensive.|$|E

25|$|The tornado then {{crossed the}} St. Francis River into Dunklin County, Missouri, where it {{displayed}} a multiple-vortex structure. 7 homes were destroyed and 33 others were damaged in rural {{portions of the}} county. Multiple power poles were downed as well. The tornado then crossed into Pemiscot County, and struck the town of Braggadocio at F2 intensity. The tornado's only two fatalities occurred at that location when a couple was killed in their car {{as they tried to}} flee from the tornado. The tornado then re-intensified to a high-end F3 as it tore through the neighboring town of Caruthersville, destroying roughly half of the community and injuring 130 people. 226 homes were destroyed, and 542 others were damaged in town. The town's water tower, municipal airport, several churches, Caruthersville High School and Middle School, and multiple businesses were destroyed as well. The tornado abruptly dissipated just <b>outside</b> <b>town</b> after traveling 77 miles.|$|E
25|$|In 1700 {{several hundred}} French Huguenots {{migrated}} from England to the colony of Virginia, where the English Crown had promised them land grants in Lower Norfolk County. When they arrived, colonial authorities offered them instead land 20 {{miles above the}} falls of the James River, at the abandoned Monacan village known as Manakin Town, now in Powhatan County. Some settlers landed in present-day Chesterfield County. On 12 May 1705, the Virginia General Assembly passed an act to naturalise the 148 Huguenots still resident at Manakintown. Of the original 390 settlers in the isolated settlement, many had died; others lived <b>outside</b> <b>town</b> on farms in the English style; and others moved to different areas. Gradually they intermarried with their English neighbours. Through the 18th and 19th centuries, descendants of the French migrated west into the Piedmont, and across the Appalachian Mountains into the West of what became Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, and other states. In the Manakintown area, the Huguenot Memorial Bridge across the James River and Huguenot Road were named in their honour, as were many local features, including several schools, including Huguenot High School.|$|E
25|$|The {{first known}} school {{to operate at}} Pea Ridge was the Shelton Academy, opened in 1851 with a Professor Lockhart as teacher. For unknown reasons (possibly low {{enrollment}} and inadequate funds), the school closed in 1858. In 1874, Reverend Elijah Buttram opened a school at Buttram's Chapel <b>outside</b> <b>town,</b> with Professor John Rains Roberts as principal. After five years, the school, sponsored by the Masonic lodge, the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, and local patrons, was moved into Pea Ridge where, in 1880, a two-story brick schoolhouse was erected. The school was granted a charter as an academy in 1884, and in 1887–88, the building was enlarged to accommodate 250 pupils. Professor Roberts directed the academy until 1894. Nannie Roberts, his sister, devoted her long career to teaching younger pupils at Pea Ridge Academy {{and later in the}} public school. By 1914, the academy was known as the Pea Ridge Masonic College. It operated until 1916, offering elementary, high school, and college-level instruction. Then, as community sentiment favored forming a public school system, the college was closed, and the property deeded to the Pea Ridge Public School. In 1930, the school district dismantled the college building and constructed a one-story building on the site. Principal Joe Roulhac, a noted local educator and carpenter, supervised the design and construction. Extra wings were added in the late 1940s and early 1950s. This community landmark, which housed the entire school before 1948, served as home of the Pea Ridge High School until 2001, when a new high school complex was completed on West Pickens Road. The 1930 building was finally razed in March 2005 after estimated costs to update the aging building to current school standards, or to convert it to other community uses, were determined to be prohibitive.|$|E
