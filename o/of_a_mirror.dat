50|$|Many amateur {{telescope}} makers use cells {{which are}} designed via equal area rule calculation, using {{programs such as}} David Chandler's public domain program, Cell. However, such calculation {{does not account for}} mechanical stresses introduced in one part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> telescope <b>mirror</b> by another part, whereas finite element analysis can be used to reduce such stress. Although general finite element analysis programs such as Nastran will work for <b>mirror</b> cells, <b>an</b> advantage <b>of</b> PLOP is that it can be set to ignore deformation that merely results in refocus <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mirror's</b> parabola. PLOP can be used to calculate floating support points for <b>a</b> <b>mirror's</b> axial (rear) support; however, additional tools are needed to calculate potential error from <b>a</b> <b>mirror's</b> lateral (edge) support.|$|R
5|$|Analysis of {{the flawed}} images {{showed that the}} cause of the problem was that the primary mirror had been {{polished}} to the wrong shape. Although it was probably the most precisely figured optical mirror ever made, smooth to about 10 nanometers, at the perimeter it was too flat by about 2,200 nanometers (2.2 micrometers). This difference was catastrophic, introducing severe spherical aberration, a flaw in which light reflecting off the edge <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mirror</b> focuses on a different point from the light reflecting off its center.|$|E

She considered it challenging; for the most difficult part, {{a scene in which}} she had to cry, she practised in front <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mirror.</b> In May 2011 she began dating her Love in Perth costar Derby Romero; the couple split up sometime before January 2012.|$|E
5|$|Numerous works, {{from the}} ancient to the baroque, have been cited as sources of {{inspiration}} for Velázquez. The nude Venuses of the Italian painters, such as Giorgione's Sleeping Venus (c. 1510) and Titian's Venus of Urbino (1538), were the main precedents. In this work, Velázquez combined two established poses for Venus: recumbent on a couch or a bed, and gazing at a mirror. She {{is often described as}} looking at herself on the mirror, although this is physically impossible since viewers can see her face reflected in their direction. This phenomenon is known as the Venus effect. In a number of ways the painting represents a pictorial departure, through its central use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mirror,</b> and because it shows the body of Venus turned away from the observer of the painting.|$|E

He also promoted the record with television performances on 106 & Park, The Wendy Williams Show, Late Show with David Letterman, and Jimmy Kimmel Live!. He subsequently toured {{in support of the}} album for six months throughout North America and Europe, including concert dates as a supporting act on Trey Songz' Chapter V World Tour during November 2012 to February 2013, and a headlining tour in the UK and Ireland during January 2013. Miguel opened for Alicia Keys on her Set The World On Fire Tour during March and April. Although he did not choreograph his shows, he routinely rehearsed in a dance studio and practiced singing in front <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mirror.</b> In concert, he performed dramatic leaps, staggers, and other moves fashioned after Little Richard and James Brown. He started ripping his shirt off during performances after being inspired by Songz' concerts.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a scene of red nail polish {{dripping}} from a bottle. It then cuts to Buchanan, who is lying and tapping her foot against the floor. She begins to start feeling her body. In the next scene, Range is seen standing in front <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mirror</b> with a red lollipop, where she later begins to dance against the sink. Next, all the Sugababes are featured in separate toilet cubicles where they have their hands against the walls. The video cuts to Berrabah walking towards a hand dryer, which she rotates towards her face, causing her hair to be blown. Following this, Range sits on a couch and uses the nail polish to colour her nails. The group is again seen in the cubicles, where they repeatedly open and close the doors. Later, Buchanan, Range and Berrabah are featured in front of red curtains with traditional silver, gold and black outfits, respectively. The final scene shows the group {{in front of the}} cubicles where they begin dancing robotically.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{successfully}} composite computer grahpics elements into live action scenes {{it is important}} that the lighting of the CG object match the lighting of the scene into which it is being composited.

25|$|A beam {{of light}} {{reflects}} off a mirror at an angle of reflection equal to its angle of incidence (if the size <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mirror</b> is {{much larger than the}} wavelength of light). That is, if the {{beam of light}} is shining on a mirror's surface, at a ° angle vertically, then it reflects from the point of incidence at a ° angle from vertically in the opposite direction. This law mathematically follows from the interference of a plane wave on a flat boundary (of much larger size than the wavelength).|$|E
