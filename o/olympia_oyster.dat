25|$|The {{accidental}} or intentional {{introduction of}} species by humans {{has the potential}} to negatively impact native oyster populations. For example, non-native species in Tomales Bay have resulted in the loss of half of California's <b>Olympia</b> <b>oysters.</b>|$|R
50|$|Species {{restoration}} {{projects for}} the <b>Olympia</b> <b>oyster</b> funded by the US Government are active in Puget Sound and San Francisco Bay. An active restoration project {{is taking place in}} Liberty Bay, Washington. This Puget Sound location is the home of an old and new <b>Olympia</b> <b>oyster</b> population. Intertidal areas with native oyster populations or evidence of past populations are strong candidates for re-introduction. The re-establishment of the population is currently threatened by the invasive Japanese oyster drill Ocenebra inornata. This species preys on the oysters by drilling a hole between the two valves and digesting the oyster's tissues. O. inorata is a threat to the oyster especially in areas with low populations of the mussel Mytilis.|$|E

50|$|The once {{thriving}} <b>Olympia</b> <b>oyster</b> {{has been}} endangered by pollution from mills and outboard motors.

50|$|Ostrea lurida oysters {{lie with}} their left valve on the substrate, {{where they are}} firmly attached. Unlike most bivalves, oysters {{do not have a}} foot in adulthood; they also lack an {{anterior}} adductor muscle and do not secrete byssal threads, like mussels do. <b>Olympia</b> <b>oysters</b> are suspension feeders, meaning they filter their surrounding water and screen out the phytoplankton they feed on. <b>Olympia</b> <b>oysters</b> filter between 9 and 12 quarts of water each day, but is highly dependent on environmental conditions. This is an essential function to keeping marine waters clean. Oyster beds also provide shelter for anemones, crabs, and other small marine life.|$|R
40|$|Prevalent {{upwelling}} {{in summer}} {{months in the}} Northwest United States can bring anomalously acidified waters to Puget Sound. This, combined {{with the effects of}} increasing summer peak water temperatures, poses a joint threat from two separate abiotic factors directly linked to climate change. We investigated the response in mortality of <b>Olympia</b> <b>Oysters,</b> Ostrea lurida, to these two factors by pretreating oysters in three different pH conditions for different lengths of time before exposing them to a three-day lethal and sublethal heat shock with different day and night temperatures. We were able to determine the lethal and near-sublethal temperature for <b>Olympia</b> <b>oysters</b> in a three-day heat shock as 41 °C and 36 °C, respectively. When analyzing mortality, our experiment yielded ambiguous statistical results but did indicate that oysters pretreated in low pH conditions may have less mortality in a lethal heat shock than oysters in high pH conditions. This suggests that <b>Olympia</b> <b>oysters</b> could be able to develop resistance to a primary stress after previous exposure to an unrelated secondary stress. We plan to investigate morphological and structural qualities of these oyster shells to determine what additional effects the various pH pretreatments might have had on the oysters...|$|R
50|$|Another type of estuary {{habitat is}} formed by native <b>Olympia</b> <b>oysters</b> (Ostrea lurida).

40|$|<b>Olympia</b> <b>oysters</b> are {{the only}} oyster native {{to the west coast}} of North America. The {{population}} within Puget Sound, WA has been decreasing significantly since the early 1900 ’s. Current restoration efforts are focused on supplementing local populations with hatchery bred oysters. A recent study by Heare et al. (2017) has shown differences in stress response in oysters from different locations in Puget Sound however, nothing is known about the underlying mechanisms associated with these observed differences. In this study, expression of genes associated with growth, immune function, and gene regulatory activity in oysters from Oyster Bay, Dabob Bay, and Fidalgo Bay were characterized following temperature and mechanical stress. We found that heat stress and mechanical stress significantly changed expression in molecular regulatory activity and immune response, respectively. We also found that oysters from Oyster Bay had the most dramatic response to stress at the gene expression level. These data provide important baseline information on the physiological response of Ostrea lurida to stress and provide clues to underlying performance differences in the three populations examined...|$|R
50|$|Puget Sound {{is home to}} {{numerous}} species of marine invertebrates, including sponges, sea anemones, chitons, clams, sea snails, limpets crabs, barnacles starfish, sea urchins, and sand dollars. Dungeness crabs (Metacarcinus magister) occur throughout Washington waters, including Puget Sound. Many bivalves occur in Puget Sound, such as Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) and geoduck clams (Panopea generosa). The <b>Olympia</b> <b>oyster</b> (Ostreola conchaphila), once common in Puget Sound, was depleted by human activities during the 20th century.

50|$|Crassostrea virginica, the Eastern Oyster, {{was a major}} reef builder in the Chesapeake Bay {{until the}} late 19th century. Because of overfishing, {{environmental}} degradation, and disease, populations of C. virginica underwent a drastic reduction in population size. There is an established pattern connecting human fishing practices to oyster population collapse across the globe. Besides the collapse of C. virginica reefs {{on the east coast}} of the United States, populations of the <b>Olympia</b> <b>Oyster,</b> Ostrea lurida, on the western coast of the United States and the Rock Oyster, Saccostrea glomerata, of eastern Australia have both been heavily impacted by harmful fishing practices.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{suspected}} that contact between Europeans and Indians became more numerous and consistent {{in the late}} 1700s. By the time Lewis & Clark arrived in 1806, Indians had firearms and metal implements. The first European settlers arrived in Netarts Bay in 1865, and records suggest native <b>Olympia</b> <b>oysters</b> were abundant in the bay. In fact, there are indications oyster harvests by European settlers began as early as 1868 and {{that at least some}} of these oysters were exported to San Francisco. Historic accounts indicate a shanty town, named Oysterville, was present in the bay during this time, and the bay was sometimes called [...] "Oyster Bay." [...] By 1903 virtually all shore line of the spit was claimed and occupied. Despite early claims, residential use of Netarts sand spit had mostly disappeared by 1920 and subsequent growth concentrated in Netarts along the northeast bay. A commercial oyster cultivating industry was present from 1930-1957; however, the accidental introduction of the Japanese oyster drill led to the collapse of this industry in 1957.|$|R
40|$|We {{monitored}} oyster {{mortality in}} Yaquina, Coos, and Tillamook bays from July 1966 -March 1972.

50|$|Like its {{counterpart}} on {{the opposite}} coast to the East, there is a grand variety of shellfish in this region. Geoducks are a native species of giant clam that have incredibly long necks, and they are eaten by the bucket full as well as shipped to Asia for millions of dollars as they {{are believed to be}} an aphrodisiac. Gaper clams are a favorite food, often grilled or steamed in a sauce, as is the native California abalone, which although protected as a food source is a traditional foodway predating settlement by whites and today features heavily in the cooking of fine restaurants as well as in home cooking, in mirin-flavored soups (the influence of Japanese cooking is strong in the region) noodle dishes and on the barbecue. <b>Olympia</b> <b>oysters</b> are served on the half shell as well as the Kumamoto oyster, introduced by Japanese immigrants and a staple at dinner as an appetizer. California mussels are a delicacy of the region, and have been a feature of the cooking for generations: there is evidence that Native American tribes consumed them up and down the California coast for centuries in their masses.|$|R
50|$|The farming {{of oysters}} and other {{shellfish}} is relatively benign or even restorative environmentally, and holds promise for relieving pressure on land-based protein sources. Restoration of oyster populations are encouraged for the ecosystem services they provide, including water quality maintenance, shoreline protection and sediment stabilization, nutrient cycling and sequestration, and habitat for other organisms. A native <b>Olympia</b> <b>oyster</b> restoration project {{is taking place}} in Liberty Bay, Washington, and numerous oyster restoration projects are underway in the Chesapeake Bay. In the U.S., Delaware is the only East Coast state without oyster aquaculture, but making aquaculture a state-controlled industry of leasing water by the acre for commercial harvesting of shellfish is being considered. Supporters of Delaware's legislation to allow aquaculture cite revenue, job creation, and nutrient cycling benefits. It is estimated that one acre can produce nearly 750,000 oysters, which could filter between 15 and 40 million gallons of water daily.|$|E
50|$|Archaeologists {{believe that}} Native Americans {{constructed}} the Shellmound which was largely {{made up of}} shellfish and animal remains, the remnants of millions of meals consumed at the site by the prehistoric residents. The shells they threw aside from their catches of shellfish eventually covered some {{hundreds of thousands of}} square feet, marked by several cones. Evidence indicates that the site was a large village, occupied from at least 2800 years ago to 400 years ago. It was also used by Native Americans as a resting-place for their dead. The site was recognized as an archaeological deposit {{from the time of the}} first historically recorded settlement of the East Bay, and was subjected to one of the earliest archaeological excavations in the United States. When the University of California excavated this site in 1902, and again in the 1920s, they found that the mound consisted mostly of clam, mussel, and oyster (predominantly <b>Olympia</b> <b>Oyster)</b> shells, with a plentiful mixture of cockleshells.|$|E
5000|$|The {{population}} of <b>Olympia</b> <b>oyster</b> (Ostrea Lurida), been declining due to sewage contamination {{and the effects}} of sulfur liquor emissions (from pulp mills). Both of these things were shown to have serious effects on the reproductive part as well as the health part of Ostrea lurida. Some other problems include mining, logging, and boat traffic. Pollution like gasoline and motor oil from the boats is harmful to the species of oyster as well. The Journal of Shellfish Research states, [...] "Although oysters may be able to tolerate brief exposure to motor oil and gasoline by closing their shell, up to 14% population mortality increases after 10 days exposure". As the article states, another large problem for olympia oysters is the human-caused sedimentation caused by topsoil runoff in areas of logging or mining. The sedimentation leads to murky waters and oysters that are buried under layers of runoff as well as non-secure places to inhabit.|$|E
40|$|Samples {{of whole}} and shucked Pacific and <b>Olympia</b> <b>oysters,</b> {{contaminated}} with 104 -plaque-forming units (PFU) of poliovirus Lsc- 2 ab per ml, were held refrigerated at two temperatures, 5 and - 17. 5 C. To study {{the survival of}} virus in the oysters under these conditions, samples were assayed for virus content at weekly intervals {{for as long as}} 12 weeks. Results indicated that poliovirus would survive in refrigerated oysters for a period varying from 30 to 90 days, depending upon temperature. The survival rate varied from 10 to 13 %. To study the extent of the hazard presented by oysters contaminated with virus, samples of whole and shucked Pacific oysters contaminated with 104 PFU of poliovirus Lsc- 2 ab per ml were heat processed in four ways: by stewing, frying, baking, and steaming. Results indicated that virus in oysters withstood these methods of processing. The survival rate varied from 7 to 10 % and appeared dependent upon the processing method used. Heat penetration studies showed that the internal temperature in the oyster was not sufficient to inactivate all of the virus present. These results suggest that not only fresh but also refrigerated and cooked oysters can serve as vectors for the dissemination of virus disease if the shellfish are harvested from a polluted area...|$|R

40|$|Continuing long-tenn {{studies of}} oyster disease {{problems}} {{have been carried out}} over the past 26 years using field monitoring, gross, histologic, and ultrastructural pathologic methods. A microorganism of uncertain taxonomy was discovered in 1963 by J. G. Mackin in association with lesions and mortalities of Japanese oysters, Crassostrea gigas, from Denman Island, Britisll Columbia, Canada. Mackin coined the tenn "microcell " for this organism and described the parasite as 1 - 3,. m cells with small nuclei which occurred within vesicular connective tissue cells adjacent to characteristic abscesses. We are describing this organism as Mikrot:ytos mac 1 cini sp. n. in his honor. Similar appearing organisms were seen by the senior author in flat oysters, Ostrea edulis, from Milford, Connecticut, on three different occasions: 1) in oysters transferred from Milford. Connecticut, to Chincoteague Bay. Virginia; 2) in oysters transferred from Milford to Elkhorn Slough, California; and 3) in oysters trans-ferred from Milford to Oxford, Maryland, and held in recirculated sea water. The causative organism in these three episodes has been sIlown by electron microscopy to be Bonamia ostreae, the parasite that was implicated in recent mortalities in flat oysters in Europe. Similar organisms have also been seen in <b>Olympia</b> <b>oysters,</b> Ostrea lurida, from Oregon and in the Sydney rock oyster, Saccostrea commercialis, from Australia. Presence of the organism in the latter species is associsted with the winter mortalities originally described by T. C.
