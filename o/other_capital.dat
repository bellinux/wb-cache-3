5|$|During 1918, New Zealand and the Grand Fleet's <b>other</b> <b>capital</b> {{ships were}} used on {{occasion}} to escort convoys between Britain and Norway. The 2nd BCS spent {{the period from}} 8 to 21 February covering these convoys in company with battleships and destroyers, and put to sea on 6 March in company with the 1st BCS to support minelayers. The 2nd BCS again supported minelayers in the North Sea from 25 June or 26 June {{to the end of}} July. During September and October, New Zealand and the 2nd BCS supervised and protected minelaying operations north of Orkney. The battlecruiser was present at the surrender of the High Seas Fleet as part of the 2nd BCS.|$|E
5|$|Kronprinz Wilhelm {{was never}} raised for scrapping, {{unlike most of}} the <b>other</b> <b>capital</b> ships that were scuttled. Kronprinz Wilhelm and two of her sisters had sunk in deeper water than the <b>other</b> <b>capital</b> ships, which made a salvage attempt more difficult. The {{outbreak}} of World War II in 1939 put a halt to all salvage operations, {{and after the war}} it was determined that salvaging the deeper wrecks was financially impractical. The rights to future salvage operations on the wreck were sold to Britain in 1962. The depth in which the three battleships sank insulated them from the radiation released by the use of atomic weapons. As a result, Kronprinz Wilhelm and her sisters {{are one of the few}} remaining sources of radiation-free steel. The ships have occasionally had steel removed for use in scientific devices. Kronprinz Wilhelm and the other vessels on the bottom of Scapa Flow are a popular dive site, and are protected by a policy barring divers from recovering items from the wrecks. In 2017, marine archaeologists from the Orkney Research Center for Archaeology conducted extensive surveys of Kronprinz Wilhelm and nine other wrecks in the area, including six other German and three British warships. The archaeologists mapped the wrecks with sonar and examined them with remotely operated underwater vehicles as part of an effort to determine how the wrecks are deteriorating.|$|E
5|$|Markgraf {{was never}} raised for scrapping, {{unlike most of}} the <b>other</b> <b>capital</b> ships that were scuttled. Markgraf and her two sisters had sunk in deeper water than the <b>other</b> <b>capital</b> ships, which made any salvage attempt more difficult. The {{outbreak}} of World War II in 1939 put a halt to all salvage operations, {{and after the war}} it was determined that salvaging the deeper wrecks was financially impractical. The rights to future salvage operations on the wrecks were sold to Britain in 1962. Owing {{to the fact that the}} steel that composed their hulls was produced before the advent of nuclear weapons, Markgraf and her sisters are among the few accessible sources of low-background steel, which has occasionally been removed for use in scientific devices. Markgraf and the other vessels on the bottom of Scapa Flow are a popular dive site, and are protected by a policy barring divers from recovering items from the wrecks. In 2017, marine archaeologists from the Orkney Research Center for Archaeology conducted extensive surveys of Markgraf and nine other wrecks in the area, including six other German and three British warships. The archaeologists mapped the wrecks with sonar and examined them with remotely operated underwater vehicles as part of an effort to determine how the wrecks are deteriorating.|$|E

5|$|The Forbidden City remains {{important}} in the civic scheme of Beijing. The central north–south axis remains the central axis of Beijing. This axis extends to the south through Tiananmen gate to Tiananmen Square, the ceremonial centre of the People's Republic of China, and on to Yongdingmen. To the north, it extends through Jingshan Hill to the Bell and Drum Towers. This axis is not exactly aligned north–south, but is tilted by slightly more than two degrees. Researchers now believe that the axis was designed in the Yuan dynasty to be aligned with Xanadu, the <b>other</b> <b>capital</b> of their empire.|$|E
5|$|The airport {{features}} direct {{flights to}} 33 domestic destinations and to destinations in the Pacific, Europe, Asia and North America. Melbourne Airport {{is the number}} one arrival/departure point for the airports of four of Australia's seven <b>other</b> <b>capital</b> cities. Melbourne serves as a major hub for Qantas and Virgin Australia, while Jetstar Airways and Tiger Airways Australia utilise the airport as home base. A regular coach service provides public transport to and from the city. Melbourne is the busiest airport for international export freight as of August 2011, while second busiest for import freight. Domestically, Melbourne serves as headquarters for Australian air Express and Toll Priority and handles more domestic freight than any other airport in the nation.|$|E
5|$|The {{automobile}} {{is by far}} {{the dominant}} form of transport in Canberra. The city is laid out so that arterial roads connecting inhabited clusters run through undeveloped areas of open land or forest, which results in a low population density; this also means that idle land is available for the development of future transport corridors if necessary without the need to build tunnels or acquire developed residential land. In contrast, <b>other</b> <b>capital</b> cities in Australia have substantially less green space.|$|E
50|$|Costa Rica-Russia {{relations}} (Российско-костариканские отношения) are {{the bilateral}} {{relationships between the}} countries Costa Rica and Russia. Each {{of the two countries}} has an embassy in the <b>other's</b> <b>capital</b> city, Moscow and San José.|$|R

5|$|Using deficit spending, a government-sponsored {{programme}} {{for economic}} renewal focused on public works projects. In public work projects of 1934, 1.7 million Germans immediately {{were put to}} work, which gave them an income and social benefits. The most famous of the projects was the high speed roadway, the Reichsautobahn, known as the German autobahns. <b>Other</b> <b>capital</b> construction projects included hydroelectric facilities such as the Rur Dam, water supplies such as Zillierbach Dam, and transportation hubs such as Zwickau Hauptbahnhof. Over the next five years, unemployment plummeted and average wages both per hour and per week rose.|$|E
5|$|The First Balkan War {{broke out}} in October 1912, when the Balkan League {{attacked}} the Ottoman Empire. The condition of Barbaros Hayreddin, as with most ships of the Ottoman fleet, had deteriorated significantly. During the war, Barbaros Hayreddin conducted gunnery training along with the <b>other</b> <b>capital</b> ships of the Ottoman navy, escorted troop convoys, and bombarded coastal installations. On 17 October, Barbaros Hayreddin and Turgut Reis steamed to İğneada. Two days later, the two battleships bombarded Bulgarian artillery positions near Varna. On 30 October, Barbaros Hayreddin was back outside Varna to blockade the port along with the destroyer Nümune-i Hamiyet. On 17 November, Barbaros Hayreddin and Mesûdiye bombarded Bulgarian positions {{in support of the}} I Corps, with the aid of artillery observers ashore. The battleships' gunnery was poor, though it provided a morale boost for the defending Ottoman army dug in at Çatalca. From 15 to 20 November, the ship was stationed at Büyükçekmece along with her sister ship and several other warships, but they saw no action against the small Bulgarian navy.|$|E
5|$|The fleet {{remained}} in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Versailles Treaty. Von Reuter {{believed that the}} British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. König sank at 14:00; the ship was never raised for scrapping, unlike most of the <b>other</b> <b>capital</b> ships that were scuttled. The rights to future salvage operations on the wreck were sold to Britain in 1962.|$|E

50|$|Canada—United Arab Emirates {{relations}} {{is used to}} describe the relations between the nations of Canada and the United Arab Emirates. Canada established relations with the United Arab Emirates in 1974. Each maintains an embassy in the <b>other's</b> <b>capital.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1963, {{both nations}} opened {{embassies}} in each <b>other's</b> <b>capitals,</b> respectively; however, Mexico closed its embassy in Ethiopia in 1989 due to financial reasons and Ethiopia followed suit in 1990. In 2007, Mexico re-opened its embassy in Addis Ababa.|$|R
5|$|During 1918, Australia and the Grand Fleet's <b>other</b> <b>capital</b> ships on {{occasion}} escorted convoys travelling between Britain and Norway. The 2nd BCS spent {{the period from}} 8 to 21 February covering these convoys in company with battleships and destroyers, and put to sea on 6 March in company with the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron to support minelayers. From 8 March on, the battlecruiser tested the capabilities of aircraft launched from platforms mounted over 'P' and 'Q' turrets. Australia, {{along with the rest}} of the Grand Fleet, sortied on the afternoon of 23 March 1918 after radio transmissions had revealed that the High Seas Fleet was at sea after a failed attempt to intercept the regular British convoy to Norway. However, the Germans were too far ahead of the British and escaped without firing a shot. The 2nd BCS sailed again on 25 April to support minelayers, then cover one of the Scandinavian convoys the next day. Following the successful launch of a fully laden Sopwith 1½ Strutter scout plane on 14 May, Australia started carrying two aircraft—a Strutter for reconnaissance, and a Sopwith Camel fighter—and operated them until the end of the war. The 2nd BCS again supported minelayers in the North Sea between 25–26 June and 29–30 July. During September and October, Australia and the 2nd BCS supervised and protected minelaying operations north of Orkney.|$|E

25|$|Mainstream {{television}} transmission commenced in Sydney and Melbourne {{just in time}} for the Melbourne Olympic Games in November/December 1956. It was then phased in at <b>other</b> <b>capital</b> cities, and then into rural markets. Many forms of entertainment, particularly drama and variety, proved more suited to television than radio, so the actors and producers migrated there.|$|E

25|$|The Court's {{approach}} to the death penalty, itself permitted by {{the text of the}} original Convention, may reduce its use by non-signatory States that seek to extradite suspects from signatory States. The decision makes it difficult, if not impossible, for the US and <b>other</b> <b>capital</b> punishment countries to extradite suspects on capital charges from signatory States, without giving assurances that the death penalty will not be executed.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{television}} stations were launched, mainly concentrated around {{southern and eastern}} parts of the country. By {{the turn of the}} decade, the takeup of television had increased dramatically – by 1960 up to 70% of homes in Sydney and Melbourne had a television set. Following its introduction to regional centres and <b>other</b> <b>capital</b> cities through the late 1950s and 1960s over 90% of Australian homes in established markets had a television set. The new medium had also become highly lucrative to advertisers.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy of}} Kosovo is a {{transition}} economy. It {{suffered from the}} combined results of political upheaval, the following Yugoslav wars, the Serbian dismissal of Kosovo employees and international sanctions on Serbia of which it was then part. Since the independence in 2008, the economy has grown every year. Despite declining foreign assistance, growth of GDP averaged over 5% a year. This was despite the Global financial crisis of 2009 and the subsequent Eurozone crisis. Additionally, the inflation rate was low. The most economic development, {{has taken place in}} the trade, retail and construction sectors. Kosovo is highly dependent on remittances from the Diaspora, FDI and <b>other</b> <b>capital</b> inflows.|$|E

25|$|St. Petersburg prospered {{under the}} rule of two most {{powerful}} women in Russian history. Peter's daughter, Empress Elizabeth, reigned from 1740 to 1762, without a single execution in 22 years. She cut taxes, downsized government, and was known for masqerades and festivities, amassing a wardrobe of about 12 thousand dresses, most of them now preserved as museum art pieces. She supported the Russian Academy of Sciences and completed both the Winter Palace and the Summer Palace, which then became residences of Empress Catherine the Great, who reigned for 34 years, from 1762 to 1796. Under her rule, which exemplified that of an enlightened despot, more palaces were built in St. Petersburg than in any <b>other</b> <b>capital</b> in the world.|$|E
25|$|The ABC {{commenced}} {{television broadcasting}} in 1956, {{and followed the}} earlier radio practice of naming the station after the first letter of the base state. ABN-2 (New South Wales) Sydney was inaugurated by Prime Minister Robert Menzies on 5 November 1956, with the first broadcast presented by Michael Charlton, and James Dibble reading the first television news bulletin. ABV-2 (Melbourne, Victoria) followed two weeks later, on 18 November 1956. Stations in <b>other</b> <b>capital</b> cities followed: ABQ-2 (Brisbane, Queensland) (1959), ABS-2 (Adelaide, South Australia) (1960), ABW-2 (Perth, Western Australia) (1960), and ABT-2 (Hobart, Tasmania) (1960).

25|$|Ships in Eve Online come in four size classes. Small starships include frigates (small, mobile ships {{good for}} {{disruption}} and harassment) and destroyers (slightly {{larger and more}} offensively oriented than frigates). Medium starships include cruisers (multipurpose ships with many possible roles) and battlecruisers (heavier, more combat-oriented cruisers). Battleships (heavily armed and armoured dedicated combat ships) make up the large size class. Extra-large (or capital-class) starships include carriers (mobile bases that can launch fighters and are adept at repairing other ships), dreadnoughts (dedicated siege ships for attacking structures and other capitals), supercarriers (larger versions of carriers focused more on damage to capital class ships) and titans (supermassive mobile battle stations, capable of equipping doomsday devices which do massive amounts of damage to <b>other</b> <b>capital</b> ships).|$|E
50|$|Chad-Romania {{relations}} were established on 15 July 1969. However, neither country has an embassy in the <b>other's</b> <b>capital,</b> and although {{an agreement on}} trade was signed in 1969, followed by an agreement on economic and technical cooperation in 1971, , the volume of bilateral trade remained insignificant.|$|R
