30|$|Understanding the {{chemical}} composition and effect of each component on the mechanical {{properties of the}} lenses is crucial to design the <b>ocular</b> <b>lenses</b> with the best possible performances. Lenses based on silicone acrylate monomers include {{the wide range of}} lenses; soft hydrogel lenses and rigid gas permeable hard <b>ocular</b> <b>lenses</b> (RGPL) (Mannis et al. 2003). The RGPL are made in rod-shape blank with a maximum initial diameter of 5  cm and then cut to form discs with desired thickness. This rod-shape blanks are purchased by vision centers. <b>Ocular</b> <b>lenses</b> are produced by cutting this rod-shape blanks on a lathe, polishing and finishing due to required curvatures. In other word, RGD lenses due to the presence of the blade on the surface are opaque and they need extra final finishing process. Therefore, suitable hardness of materials guarantees the quality of the cutting, finishing and polishing steps of the <b>ocular</b> <b>lenses.</b> Taguchi method {{is one of the best}} option to determine the optimal number of tests when the number of variables or factors is high (Roy 1968). Taguchi with combined orthogonal arrays was used to study the effect of five fundamental constituents of lenses, including hydroxyethyl methacrylate, methyl methacrylate, triethyleneglycol dimethacrylate, dimethyl itaconate, 3 -(trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate, on hardness.|$|R
30|$|As a brief history, <b>ocular</b> <b>lenses</b> have {{developed}} by the earliest ideas from Leonardo da Vinci to the present day. Firstly, {{they were made of}} glasses and lens materials gradually became friendlier by invention of hydrogels which were more comfortable and adjustable. High water content lenses should be thicker for more durability but increasing the thickness impairs the oxygen permeability. In the twenty-first century, silicone hydrogels allowed more than 90 % of available O 2 to reach the eyes and allowed the lenses to be thinner (Gasson and Moriss 2003). These days, the <b>ocular</b> <b>lenses</b> and color lenses are worn by many people for different purposes.|$|R
50|$|Distichiasis (commonly {{known as}} “double eyelash”) and Persistent Hyperplastic Primary Vitreous (or PHPV)—a {{condition}} whereby {{the blood supply}} to the <b>ocular</b> <b>lens</b> fails to regress and fibrovascular tissue forms, causing hazy vision—both of which are checked by way of an ocular examination throughout {{the life of a}} breeding stud or brood-bitch to minimise the transfer and spread of these conditions.|$|E
50|$|Melanin in the eyes, in {{the iris}} and choroid, helps {{protect them from}} {{ultraviolet}} and high-frequency visible light; people with gray, blue, and green eyes are more at risk for sun-related eye problems. Further, the <b>ocular</b> <b>lens</b> yellows with age, providing added protection. However, the lens also becomes more rigid with age, losing most of its accommodation — the ability to change shape to focus from far to near — a detriment due probably to protein crosslinking caused by UV exposure.|$|E
50|$|Major {{intrinsic}} {{protein is}} a member of the water-transporting aquaporins as well as the original member of the MIP family of channel proteins. The function of the fiber cell membrane protein encoded by this gene is undetermined, yet this protein is speculated to play a role in intracellular communication. The MIP protein is expressed in the <b>ocular</b> <b>lens</b> and is required for correct lens function. This gene has been mapped among aquaporins AQP2, AQP5, and AQP6, in a potential gene cluster at 12q13.|$|E
40|$|New {{platforms}} for multi-functional ocular lenses: engineering double-sided functionalized nano-coatingsA scalable {{platform to}} prepare multi-functional <b>ocular</b> <b>lenses</b> is demonstrated. Using rapidly dissolving polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as the active stabilizing matrix, {{both sides of}} <b>ocular</b> <b>lenses</b> were coated using a modified scaled-up masking electrohydrodynamic atomization (EHDA) technique (flow rates variable between 5 and 10 μL/min, applied voltage 4 - 11 kV). Each side was coated (using a specially designed flip-able well) selectively with a pre-determined morphology and model drug substance. PVP nanoparticles (inner side, to be {{in contact with the}} cornea, mean size &lt;ca. 100 nm) were encapsulated with a probe (flourescein dye) and PVP nanofibres (outer side, to be exposed to air and eye lid, mean width size &lt;ca. 200 nm) were encapsulated with chloramphenicol (5 w/w% PVP). Release of the probe and anti-microbial activity (using Staphylococcus aureus NCTC 6571) were demonstrated based on rapid dissolution and contact of PVP model substance matrix. Adapting these findings further for advanced EHDA technologies (encapsulation layering, controllable size and deposition and multi-phase media deposition options) and intrinsic material properties (functional polymers/excipients and advanced controlled release strategies) suggests several therapeutic platforms for <b>ocular</b> <b>lenses</b> can be further developed at ambient temperature and pressure. These provide multi-functional properties (in personalized delivery, nanomedicine and nanosensors) from a single drug delivery device. © 2015 Informa UK Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
30|$|There {{are many}} {{ophthalmic}} devices, especially designed for eye disorders {{to provide the}} best possible vision. <b>Ocular</b> <b>lenses</b> which are considered as medical devices can be worn to correct vision, cosmetic or therapeutic purposes.

50|$|An eyepiece, or <b>ocular</b> <b>lens,</b> {{is a type}} of lens that is {{attached}} to a variety of optical devices such as telescopes and microscopes. It is so named because it is usually the lens that is closest to the eye when someone looks through the device. The objective lens or mirror collects light and brings it to focus creating an image. The eyepiece is placed near {{the focal point of the}} objective to magnify this image. The amount of magnification depends on the focal length of the eyepiece.|$|E
50|$|Microwave-induced {{cataracts}} {{have been}} reported. Experiments on rabbits and dogs, {{mostly in the}} UHF range of frequencies, shown that the ocular effects are confined to eyelids and conjuctiva (as e.g. anterior segment keratitis or iritis). Cataracts were observed at several workers exposed to radiofrequency radiation, but {{in some of the}} cases the cause was unrelated to the RF exposure and in the other cases the evidence was incomplete or inconclusive. Some sources however mention incidence of microwave-related injuries of <b>ocular</b> <b>lens</b> and retina and the possibility of thermal effects to cause cataracts or focal tissue burns (incl. keratitis).|$|E
50|$|The eyepiece, or <b>ocular</b> <b>lens,</b> is a {{cylinder}} containing {{two or more}} lenses; its function is to bring the image into focus for the eye. The eyepiece is inserted into the top end of the body tube. Eyepieces are interchangeable and many different eyepieces can be inserted with different degrees of magnification. Typical magnification values for eyepieces include 5×, 10× (the most common), 15X and 20×. In some high performance microscopes, the optical configuration of the objective lens and eyepiece are matched to give the best possible optical performance. This occurs most commonly with apochromatic objectives.|$|E

[2008]). In order to express the number of cells as biomass concentration it was consider that the weight of one B. thuringiensis cell is 2.3 pg (Rodríguez and de la Torre [1996]).|$|R
50|$|Normal human lens {{is placed}} inside a capsular bag by nature. During trauma, surgery or {{sometimes}} by genetic cause the bag is damaged, weak or absent. Under this condition, one cannot place a normal intraocular lens (IOL) in the bag. To overcome this problem, {{the technique of}} glued IOL was introduced by Prof Amar Agarwal in 2007, December for lens implantation in eyes with the absent or deficient capsular bag.9,10 Here 2 scleral flaps about 180 degrees apart are made and the IOL is inserted through the corneal incision (Fig 3). After making the sclerotomy below the flaps, the haptics are externalized and tucked in a scleral tunnel {{at the point of}} exit. Maggi and Maggi in 1997 were the first to report sutureless scleral fixation of a special IOL. Gabor Scharioth and Pavilidis in 2006 reported the scleral tuck and intrascleral haptic fixation of a posterior chamber Intra <b>ocular</b> <b>lens</b> (PC IOL). Fibrin glue is applied for apposing the flaps and conjunctiva. PDEK can be combined or performed simultaneously with glued IOL implantation in eyes with existing corneal decompensation with aphakia, IOL decenteration or dislocated lens. Sometimes, one may require removal of the existing lens (as in Anterior Chamber IOL) and replacement with the other by this method. So far we have seen good anatomical and functional outcome in combined PDEK with glued IOL (Fig 4).|$|E
50|$|How {{these genes}} {{result in the}} eye {{disorder}} is unknown {{but it has been}} postulated that interference with the process of eye growth after birth may be involved in contrast to anophthalmia (absence of eyeball) which originates much earlier during foetal development. SOX2 has been implicated in a substantial number (10-15%) of cases and in many other cases failure to develop the <b>ocular</b> <b>lens</b> often results in microphthamia. Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) located on chromosome 14q32 is associated with one form of isolated microphthalmia (MCOP1. In mammals the failure of expression of the transcription factor, MITF (microphthalmia-associated transcription factor), in the pigmented retina prevents this structure from fully differentiating. This in turn causes a malformation of the choroid fissure of the eye, resulting in the drainage of vitreous humor fluid. Without this fluid, the eye fails to enlarge, thus the name microphthalmia.The gene encoding the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) {{is a member of the}} basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLH-ZIP) family. Waardenburg syndrome type 2 (WS type 2) in humans is also a type of microphthalmia syndrome. Mutations in MITF gene are thought to be responsible for this syndrome. The human MITF gene is homologous to the mouse MITF gene (aka mouse mi or microphthalmia gene); mouse with mutations in this gene are hypopigmented in their fur. The identification of the genetics of WS type 2 owes a lot to observations of phenotypes of MITF mutant mice.|$|E
40|$|Study of the {{biomechanics}} of the <b>ocular</b> <b>lens</b> {{is imperative}} to increasing {{our understanding of the}} role of the <b>ocular</b> <b>lens</b> in accommodation, to improving current surgical methods (cataract and intraocular lens replacement), and to better qualify the nature and mechanics of injuries sustained to the <b>ocular</b> <b>lens</b> (lens dehiscence, lens perforation, and traumatic cataract). Previous work done to determine and model the mechanical properties of the <b>ocular</b> <b>lens</b> includes non-ideal experimental assumptions and lack of qualified data. The goal of this work is to produce and analyze data suitable for the creation of an ultrastructurally based computational model of the <b>ocular</b> <b>lens</b> and make progress toward the generation of such a model. The creation of a model requires the determination of the material properties as well as identification of the ultrastructure of the tissue to be modeled. Unconfined compression testing of the whole porcine <b>ocular</b> <b>lens,</b> puncture testing of the whole porcine <b>ocular</b> <b>lens,</b> and nanoindentation of the anterior porcine and human lens capsule were performed to generate data from which to calculate material properties of the lens. Cryo-electron tomography and confocal LASER scanning microscopy were employed to determine the ultrastructure of the porcine lens capsule and porcine lens fiber cells, respectively. Test data were produced from the mechanical tests and the fitting of parameters to calculate material properties were started. Potential identification of the type-IV collagen meshwork of the lens capsule and positive identification of the lens fiber cells were achieved.

40|$|The aB-crystallin protein, the {{predominant}} structuralprotein of the <b>ocular</b> <b>lens,</b> {{is a member}} of the smallheat shock proteins that is also expressed abundantly in the heart and skeletal muscle. 1 The aB-crystallin was initially discovered in the vertebrate <b>ocular</b> <b>lens</b> and was dubbed crystallin because of its role in maintenance of lens transparency. 2 It is also essential for maintenance of micro-tubular integrity in striated muscles. 3 In the heart, as in the <b>ocular</b> <b>lens,</b> aB-crystallin forms soluble multimeres that function as chaperone molecules, facilitating protein folding and translocation. 4 Thus, the principal function of aB-crystallin protein is to prevent unfolding of cellular proteins damaged by all forms of stress.

40|$|Down {{syndrome}} (DS, trisomy 21) is {{the most}} common chromosomal disorder and the leading genetic cause of intellectual disability in humans. In DS, triplication of chromosome 21 invariably includes the APP gene (21 q 21) encoding the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) amyloid precursor protein (APP). Triplication of the APP gene accelerates APP expression leading to cerebral accumulation of APP-derived amyloid-b peptides (Ab), early-onset AD neuropathology, and age-dependent cognitive sequelae. The DS phenotype complex also includes distinctive early-onset cerulean cataracts of unknown etiology. Previously, we reported increased Ab accumulation, co-localizing amyloid pathology, and disease-linked supranuclear cataracts in the <b>ocular</b> <b>lenses</b> of subjects with AD.

40|$|Wearable {{contact lenses}} which can monitor {{physiological}} parameters have attracted substantial interests {{due to the}} capability of direct detection of biomarkers contained in body fluids. However, previously reported contact lens sensors can only monitor a single analyte at a time.

Here, we developed a multifunctional contact lens sensor that alleviates some of these limitations since it was developed on an actual <b>ocular</b> contact <b>lens.</b> It was also designed to monitor glucose within tears, as well as intraocular pressure using the resistance and capacitance of the electronic device. Furthermore, in-vivo and in-vitro tests using a live rabbit and bovine eyeball demonstrated its reliable operation.

40|$|In some animal species, {{exposure}} of the <b>ocular</b> <b>lens</b> to 8 -methoxypsoralen (8 -MOP) and ultraviolet-A radiation (PUVA) induces lens opacities. Case reports have suggested that PUVA therapy in humans {{may be associated with}} an increased risk of <b>ocular</b> <b>lens</b> abnormalities. To examine this risk, we compared the results of the initial and final examinations, which were performed on an average of 10 years apart in 1, 235 individuals enrolled in the PUVA Follow-up Study. After adjustment for age and sex, there was no significant relation between the risk of developing an <b>ocular</b> <b>lens</b> abnormality or cataract and the level of exposure to PUVA. A higher incidence of cataract was noted, however, in the PUVA cohort compared to a large population-based study. In addition, rates of cataract extraction were significantly higher among male members of the PUVA study compared to enrollees in the Physician Health Study. Overall, our data strongly argue against a dose-dependent increase in the risk of cataract or other lens abnormality in association with PUVA therapy in a cohort most of whose members we believe usually used recommended eye protection.
