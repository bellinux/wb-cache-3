5|$|November 27, 1888: Petition {{from the}} King of Rurutu and the Queen of Rimatara and their nobles to Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, {{and to the}} Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. May you have good health. We, Teuruarii, King of Rurutu and Te Maere, Queen of Rimatara and our nobles, ask for the Prime Minister to place our islands and our ships under the {{protection}} of the British flag. These are the islands, namely, Rurutu, Rimatara, and Marià, and there are the names of the ships: Faaito and Ronui, and the masters of the same are natives. This is our word to you: Do not forsake us; we are your children; you taught us the word of God, and that has led us in the path of civilisation; therefore we know that you are a good parent to us. The thoughts of the children cling fondly to their good parent; they do not wish to be separated from their good parent. If the parent forsake the children, the children will seek the parent; so do we; we are like those children, and we ask that you will give us your flag to protect us. We have heard that you have taken Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands under your protection, but we remain without anyone to protect us. When we received the news that Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands were placed under your protection, we wept aloud because we were forsaken by you; we were afraid lest we should be adopted by another parent. The strange parent we mean is the French. They did not feed us with the milk of the gospel, but you did. O Great Britain; you fed us with that milk which has given life to us. This is <b>our</b> <b>last</b> word to you; we do not wish for French annexation or protection, not at all, but we wish you to be our parent, O Great Britain. We pray you now to accede to this our request. This letter was written in the house of Queen Pa. -TEURUARII, TE MAERE ARII.|$|E

He was {{replaced}} by Scott Barnes and the group released their debut album, Your World on Fire, on January 6, 2009, via Rise Records. It reached No.193 on the Billboard 200. The album's success led In Fear and Faith to inclusions on many tours and festivals. They toured with groups such as Gwen Stacy, <b>Our</b> <b>Last</b> Night, Vanna, Emarosa, The Human Abstract, Life in Your Way, Burden of a Day, Lower Definition, Confide, VersaEmerge, Here I Come Falling, Broadway, In This Moment, Agraceful and Motionless in White.|$|E
25|$|Out of {{the power}} {{struggle}} in Gwynedd eventually arose {{one of the greatest}} of Welsh leaders, Llywelyn ab Iorwerth, also known as Llywelyn Fawr (the Great), who was sole ruler of Gwynedd by 1200 and by his death in 1240 was effectively ruler of much of Wales. Llywelyn made his 'capital' and headquarters at Abergwyngregyn on the north coast, overlooking the Menai Strait. His son Dafydd ap Llywelyn followed him as ruler of Gwynedd, but king Henry III of England would not allow him to inherit his father's position elsewhere in Wales. War broke out in 1241 and then again in 1245, and the issue was still in the balance when Dafydd died suddenly at Abergwyngregyn, without leaving an heir in early 1246. Llywelyn the Great's other son, Gruffudd had been killed trying to escape from the Tower of London in 1244. Gruffudd had left four sons, and a period of internal conflict between three of these ended in the rise to power of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd (also known as Llywelyn Ein Llyw Olaf – Llywelyn, <b>Our</b> <b>Last</b> Leader). The Treaty of Montgomery in 1267 confirmed Llywelyn in control, directly or indirectly, over a large part of Wales. However, Llywelyn's claims in Wales conflicted with Edward I of England, and war followed in 1277. Llywelyn was obliged to seek terms, and the Treaty of Aberconwy greatly restricted his authority. War broke out again when Llywelyn's brother Dafydd ap Gruffudd attacked Hawarden Castle on Palm Sunday 1282. On 11 December 1282, Llywelyn was lured into a meeting in Builth Wells castle with unknown Marchers, where he was killed and his army subsequently destroyed. His brother Dafydd ap Gruffudd continued an increasingly forlorn resistance. He was captured in June 1283 and was hanged, drawn and quartered at Shrewsbury. In effect Wales became England's first colony until it was finally annexed through the Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542.|$|E

500|$|Following Britain's {{declaration}} of war on Germany on 4 August 1914, Australia {{and the other members}} of the British Empire became automatically involved, with Prime Minister Joseph Cook stating on 5 August 1914 that [...] "...when the Empire is at war, so also is Australia." [...] Given the predominantly British heritage of most Australians at the time, there was considerable support from all corners of the country and large numbers of young Australian men reported to recruiting centres around the country to enlist in the following months. When Prime Minister Andrew Fisher's Labor Party came to power in September 1914, he reiterated Cook's statement saying, [...] "Should the worst happen...", Australia would [...] "...rally to the Mother Country... to help and defend her to <b>our</b> <b>last</b> man and <b>our</b> <b>last</b> shilling." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{operation}} achieved tactical surprise, {{but it was}} {{undone by}} poor execution and low pilot skill (owing to poor training). The operation failed to achieve its aim and that failure was very costly to German air power. Some of the units of the RAF, RCAF and USAAF {{on the receiving end}} of Bodenplatte had been badly hit, others not so badly, but most had sustained some losses. The Germans, however, launched Bodenplatte under a set of conditions, such as poor planning and low pilot skill, which clearly indicated any advantage gained would be outweighed by possible losses. Bodenplatte weakened the Jagdwaffe past any hope of rebuilding. General der Jagdflieger Adolf Galland said, [...] "We sacrificed <b>our</b> <b>last</b> substance".|$|E

Initially, Principal's departure was made {{out to be a}} simple [...] "snag in contract negotiations". Lorimar also made notice that the departure was related to a [...] "financial disagreement", even after Principal's agent gave notice that she was leaving. A show spokesperson commented, [...] "We were unable to reach an agreement and now the producers are revising scripts without her...she turned down <b>our</b> <b>last</b> offer."

It might be <b>our</b> <b>last</b> {{full-length}} record for a little while, but we've got a lot of things lined up that we want to record, so I think that will happen pretty soon." [...] In early 2010, drummer Brian Lane stated that Brand New were unsure about how they plan to release music in the future with technology being a factor; [...] "I don’t know if there’s a point to releasing records if they’re not physical releases, if we're going to release a lot of things digitally then I don’t see why we couldn’t release a song a week or a song a month or just put out what we like from whenever we record." [...] Lane also discussed the way the band may release their records in the future, [...] "We’re talking about recording another album but we don’t know whether it’s going to come out on a label or whether we just release songs in batches." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout his {{coaching}} tenure in Boston, Auerbach served several other roles including, {{but not limited}} to, general manager, head of scouting, personnel director and travel agent. In the early offseasons, {{he would take the}} Celtics on barnstorming tours around New England, promoting the still fledgling NBA. At the end of every season, regardless of their on-court success, he would approach owner Brown and ask, [...] "Walter, are <b>our</b> <b>last</b> paychecks going to clear?" [...] to which Brown would always positively respond, and they would. Despite Brown's own close association with the NHL's Boston Bruins, whose owners also possessed the Boston Garden, the Celtics were fleeced on concessions and profits as tenants. During this era, when most team owners not only thought of, but also treated their players as cattle and/or slaves, athletes from all the four major professional sports leagues were fighting for their rights and economic fairness. As Auerbach represented management of the Celtics, team members frustrated with their salaries had only him to complain to, or about, in their role {{in the formation of the}} players' union. These interpersonal dynamics are construed as follows by journalist David Halberstam: ...|$|E
500|$|The American third leg {{began in}} mid-August with shows at outdoor amphitheaters {{as well as}} indoor arenas. [...] Shows were often {{scheduled}} for weekends, to allow Max Weinberg to play without missing any Tonight Show time; Jay Weinberg played those shows held during the week. Then on September 25, Max Weinberg took a two-month absence from the television show, to join Springsteen for the final portion of the leg. [...] Ticket sales were slower than normal on this leg, partly due to Ticketmaster's new [...] "paperless ticketing" [...] system that may have come into effect due to the earlier problems with Springsteen sales. [...] In arenas that did not sell well, management relocated the people who bought tickets behind the stage to other sections and put up the screen used for stadium and amphitheater shows behind the stage. [...] In a hint to fans to buy up, Van Zandt said, “You never know. This could be the last tour. We do every show like it’s <b>our</b> <b>last</b> show anyway.” [...] In any case, by September 2009 the tour had sold over two million tickets overall. [...] Even some shows in Philadelphia, long a Springsteen bastion, were not sold out.|$|E

500|$|In early August 2009, a {{call was}} {{received}} from Square Enix {{telling them that}} no payments were coming. Grin's founders considered suing, but {{had run out of}} money, leading them to stop production after six months of work. Furthermore, Grin ceased production on all of their other projects and declared bankruptcy due to Sweden's severe laws against operating businesses under a debt load. Magnus Ihrefors, one of the 3D artists who worked on the project, stated that he had only found out about the game's cancellation in August, but it was like a [...] "punch in the belly; this was <b>our</b> <b>last</b> chance to get on track again." [...] The developer closed its offices on August 12, 2009, stating that delayed payments from [...] "too many publishers" [...] caused [...] "an unbearable cashflow situation," [...] and referred to Fortress in a farewell note as an [...] "unreleased masterpiece that [...] weren't allowed to finish." [...] According to the bankruptcy papers, Square Enix felt that the development goals for Fortress [...] "had not been met in a satisfactory way," [...] whereas Andersson claimed the contrary, arguing that the milestones initially set up with a producer from Square Enix had been met. Mraz stated that Grin seemed to have ignored Square Enix's requests for changes, and the Final Fantasy franchise was too important to overlook this behavior.|$|E

Five days later, Alex Goot also premiered a cover version with Madilyn Bailey through the same platform. Diane Cho of VH1 gave the cover a positive review, in which she stated that Goot and Bailey voices [...] "complement each other perfectly". In that same month, Camilla Daum covered the song on the fourth season of The Voice of Germany. In November 2014, post-hardcore band <b>Our</b> <b>Last</b> Night posted their cover of the track on their YouTube channel. Diane Cho of VH1 wrote that the band [...] "gives 'Habits' that rock 'n roll edge that works really well for this song". Canadian rock band Theory of a Deadman released an acoustic cover version in April 2015, which was later included on their record Angel Acoustic EP (2015). In May 2015, Kygo performed a piano version with vocals by Parson James on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge. In that same month, actor Vin Diesel posted a cover version of the song on his Facebook page {{as a tribute to}} his late friend Paul Walker; in the background of the performance images were projected of Diesel with Walker. Kelly Clarkson covered the song as part of her [...] "Fan Requests" [...] during her Piece by Piece Tour on 26 July 2015.

In April {{of the same}} year, after delays relating to lineup changes, their second album, The Fiancée, was released. [...] The record was produced by Matt Goldman. The writing and recording process had been driven by time constraints. [...] "It was actually a very easy record to write," [...] said Scogin, [...] "It came more naturally to us." [...] However, Scogin waited until the music was written before writing lyrics, an exercise he vowed never to attempt again. Hayley Williams of Paramore made a guest performance on the track [...] "Then Came To Kill" [...] as did Aaron Weiss of mewithoutYou when he played the harmonica on [...] "Forgive Me Nashville"; Scogin had been friends with both artists for many years. The Fiancée broke the Billboard 200it debuted at No.169, selling 6,800 copies and was well received in the Christian and secular markets. The group played a release tour with Misery Signals, I Am Ghost, and I Hate Sally, and then made a short run on the Warped Tour in summer. Another leg of The Fiancée Tour extended into spring 2008 with LoveHateHero, Alesana, <b>Our</b> <b>Last</b> Night, and Sky Eats Airplane. The lineup underwent another drastic change in mid-2008, as Jake Ryan, Dan Eaton and Jon Terry all decided to step down. Ryan and Eaton went on to form the indie pop band Queens Club and were signed to Tooth & Nail Records.|$|E
