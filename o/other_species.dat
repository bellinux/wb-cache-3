5|$|H. reaumuri {{differs from}} other desert {{woodlice}} {{in a number}} of respects. It is crepuscular, while <b>other</b> <b>species</b> are nocturnal. Apart from at the highest temperatures, it is also positively phototactic (is attracted to sunlight), while <b>other</b> <b>species</b> are negatively phototactic (move away from bright light). Compared to other woodlice, H. reaumuri walks in an unusual manner, with its body held high off the ground.|$|E
5|$|Omnivorous mammals such as {{the raccoon}} and skunk and {{herbivore}} mammal species {{such as the}} porcupine and pika, are common to the forest. The beaver is considered a species of special interest to Shoshone National Forest since its dam building activities improve habitat for numerous <b>other</b> <b>species</b> such as the moose, breeding waterfowl, various amphibians and <b>other</b> <b>species</b> dependent on a riparian environment.|$|E
50|$|In {{the past}} it was {{probably}} a very sought-after logged timber <b>species,</b> similar to <b>others</b> <b>species</b> of its family.|$|R
25|$|Physically, the fennec {{lacks the}} musk glands of <b>other</b> fox <b>species,</b> and has only 32 {{chromosome}} pairs, while <b>other</b> fox <b>species</b> have between 35 and 39. The species also displays behaviors uncharacteristic of foxes, such as living in packs while most <b>other</b> fox <b>species</b> are solitary.|$|R

5|$|Some species, such as Gryllus assimilis, take off, fly, {{and land}} {{efficiently}} and well, while <b>other</b> <b>species</b> are clumsy fliers. In some species, the hind wings are shed, leaving wing stumps, usually after dispersal of the insect by flight. In <b>other</b> <b>species,</b> {{they may be}} pulled off and consumed by the cricket itself or by another individual, probably providing a nutritional boost.|$|E
5|$|The California {{spiny lobster}} can be {{differentiated}} from the <b>other</b> <b>species</b> in the genus by the interrupted grooves across the abdomen; <b>other</b> <b>species</b> either lack grooves, or have grooves which span {{the entire body}} segment.|$|E
5|$|The Dorrigo waratah can be {{distinguished}} from {{other members of the}} genus Alloxylon by its pinnate adult leaves. This feature serves to differentiate it as <b>other</b> <b>species</b> in the genus have simple adult leaves.

5|$|The next named {{species is}} P. tubicen, {{which is the}} largest of the Parasaurolophus species. It lived in New Mexico, where three {{specimens}} are known, and can be differentiated from its <b>other</b> <b>species.</b> It possesses a long and straight crest, with a very complex interior compared to the <b>other</b> <b>species.</b> All known specimens of P. tubicen come from the De-Na-Zin Member of the Kirtland Formation.|$|E
5|$|A {{keystone}} species is {{a species that}} is connected to a disproportionately large number of <b>other</b> <b>species</b> in the food-web. Keystone species have lower levels of biomass in the trophic pyramid relative {{to the importance of}} their role. The many connections that a {{keystone species}} holds means that it maintains the organization and structure of entire communities. The loss of a keystone species results in a range of dramatic cascading effects that alters trophic dynamics, other food web connections, and can cause the extinction of <b>other</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to Schwarz et al., seven traits unite K. langenbergensis and K. guimarotae, and {{separate}} them from <b>other</b> <b>species</b> referred to Theriosuchus. These include {{the presence of}} only two unique tooth morphotypes; the choanae being placed in shallow grooves rather than a bowl-like depression; the relatively wide top of the skull; the presence of antorbital and mandibular fenestrae in all life stages; and the relatively limited contact between the lacrimal and nasal. Additionally, K. langenbergensis differs from <b>other</b> <b>species</b> in lacking teeth with low crowns; having a longer maxillary symphysis; having a crest {{on the side of}} the downward-projecting process of the postorbital; having overlap between the postorbital and the front of the squamosal; and a rectangular parietal that does not form part of the supratemporal fenestra.|$|E

30|$|Considering {{that the}} fitting {{statistics}} for the different broad groupings (Pinus <b>species,</b> Quercus <b>species,</b> <b>other</b> conifer <b>species</b> and <b>other</b> broadleaf <b>species)</b> {{are similar to those}} obtained for each individual species and that some parameters were not significant in the individual fits for some of the species, we decided to use 4 different local equations, one for each broad grouping studied.|$|R
5|$|According to the {{classification}} by Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, Oryzomys antillarum {{is one of}} eight species in the genus Oryzomys, which occurs from the eastern United States (O.palustris) into northwestern South America (O.gorgasi). O.antillarum is further part of the O.couesi section, which is centered on the widespread Central American O.couesi and also includes various <b>other</b> <b>species</b> with more limited and peripheral distributions. Many aspects of the systematics of the O.couesi section remain unclear {{and it is likely}} that the current classification underestimates the true diversity of the group. Oryzomys previously included many <b>other</b> <b>species,</b> which were progressively removed in various studies culminating in the 2006 paper by Weksler and colleagues, which excluded more than forty species from the genus. All are classified in the tribe Oryzomyini ("rice rats"), a diverse assemblage of American rodents of over a hundred species, and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of family Cricetidae, along with hundreds of <b>other</b> <b>species</b> of mainly small rodents.|$|E
5|$|After later {{studies were}} {{conducted}} with {{a larger number of}} birds, the advisories were revised and another was added for cinnamon teal. Seven <b>other</b> <b>species</b> of duck were studied and found to have levels of mercury below EPA guidelines, thus being determined safe to eat.|$|E
5|$|As a whole, Oryzomyini {{includes}} over {{a hundred}} species in about thirty genera. Oryzomyini {{is one of several}} tribes within the subfamily Sigmodontinae of the family Cricetidae, which encompasses hundreds of <b>other</b> <b>species</b> of mainly small rodents, distributed chiefly in Eurasia and the Americas.|$|E
50|$|The centre boasts up to 8,000 golden plovers and 2,000 lapwings. It {{also has}} over 250 tree sparrows (an {{endangered}} <b>species).</b> <b>Other</b> notable <b>species</b> include coots and year-round wildfowl.|$|R

5|$|Based on genome sequencing, the Tapanuli {{orangutan}} {{separated from}} other orangutans about 700,000 years ago, {{and the two}} <b>other</b> <b>species</b> diverged about 400,000 years ago. The orangutans are the only surviving species of the subfamily Ponginae, which also included several <b>other</b> <b>species,</b> such as the three extinct species of the genus Gigantopithecus, including the largest known primate Gigantopithecus blacki. The ancestors of the Ponginae subfamily split from the main ape line in Africa 16 to 19 million years ago (mya) and spread into Asia.|$|E
5|$|Besides the horse, {{there are}} seven <b>other</b> <b>species</b> of genus Equus in the Equidae family.

5|$|C.moschata, C.ficifolia, C.pedatifolia, C.foetidissima, and C.ecuadorensis {{were placed}} in their own {{separate}} species groups as they were not considered significantly close {{to any of the}} <b>other</b> <b>species</b> studied.|$|E
5|$|Carex binervis is {{classified}} in Carex subsection Elatae, part of Carex section Spirostachyae, alongside C.laevigata and <b>other</b> <b>species.</b> Natural hybrids are known between C.binervis {{and various other}} Carex species, including C.laevigata (forming C.×deserta), C.viridula (forming C.×corstorphinei), C.punctata and C.flava.|$|E
50|$|The {{species has}} a {{worldwide}} distribution. T. decipiens slime molds {{live on the}} deadwood of conifers and broadleaf trees year-round.

50|$|It is {{relatively}} easy to distinguish P. specularis from the <b>other</b> three <b>species,</b> because only in this species is the distal spine of the fore femur directed anteriorly. Also, the fastigium frontis is tubercular and obtuse in this species, where it is spiniform and acute in the <b>other</b> three <b>species.</b> Another distinguishing feature {{is that there is a}} small tubercle or nodule on the medioventral portion of the scape (the first or basal segment) of the antenna of P. specularis, in contrast to the erect distal spine in this location in the <b>other</b> three <b>species.</b> Finally, the dorsal surface of the femora are unarmed (lacking in spines) in this <b>species,</b> whereas the <b>other</b> three <b>species</b> possess spines at this location.|$|R
5|$|P. semilanceata, {{like all}} <b>others</b> <b>species</b> {{of the genus}} Psilocybe, is a {{saprobic}} fungus, meaning it obtains nutrients by breaking down organic matter.
