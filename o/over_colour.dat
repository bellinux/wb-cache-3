[234] I give Rossetti this preëminence, because, {{though the}} leading Pre-Raphaelites have all about equal power <b>over</b> <b>colour</b> in the abstract, Rossetti and Holman Hunt are {{distinguished}} {{above the rest}} for rendering colour under effects of light; and of these two, Rossetti composes with richer fancy and with a deeper sense of beauty, Hunt's stern realism leading him continually into harshness. Rossetti's carelessness, to do him justice, is only in water-colour, never in oil.|$|E

There are fewer friars now, and there are a great many of the king's recruits, who inhabit the ex-conventual barracks adjoining Santa Croce and are led forward to practise their goose-step on the sunny turf. Here too the poor old cardinals who are no longer to be seen on the Pincio descend from their mourning-coaches and relax their venerable knees. These members alone still testify to the traditional splendour of the princes of the Church; for as they advance the lifted black petticoat reveals a flash of scarlet stockings and makes you groan at the victory of civilisation <b>over</b> <b>colour.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{experience}} of controlling one’s own actions, and through them {{events in the}} outside world, is a pervasive feature of human mental life. Two experiments investigated the relation between this sense of control and the internal processes involved in action selection and cognitive control. Action selection was manipulated by subliminally priming left or right keypress actions {{in response to a}} supraliminal visual target. The action caused the display of one of several colours as an action effect. The specific colour shown depended on whether the participant’s action was compatible or incompatible with the preceding subliminal prime, and not on the prime identity alone. Unlike previous studies, therefore, the primes did not predict the to-be-expected action effects. Participants rated how much control they experienced <b>over</b> the different <b>colours.</b> Replicating previous results, compatible primes facilitated responding, whereas incompatible primes interfered with response selection. Crucially, priming also modulated the sense of control over action effects: participants experienced more control <b>over</b> <b>colours</b> produced by actions that were compatible with the preceding prime than <b>over</b> <b>colours</b> associated with prime-incompatible actions. Experiment 2 showed that this effect was not solely due to priming modulating action–effect contingencies. These results suggest that sense of control is linked to processes of selection between alternative actions, being strongest when selection is smooth and uncontested...|$|R

Thus then we {{have simply}} three {{divisions}} of Art--one, that of giving colours to substance; another, that of giving form to it without question of resistance to force; and the third, that of giving form or position which will make it capable of such resistance. All the fine arts are embraced under these three divisions. Do not {{think that it is}} only a logical or scientific affectation to mass them together in this manner; it is, on the contrary, of the first practical importance to understand that the painter's faculty, or masterhood <b>over</b> <b>colour,</b> being as subtle as a musician's over sound, must be looked to for the government of every operation in which colour is employed; and that, in the same manner, the appliance of any art whatsoever to minor objects cannot be right, unless under the direction of a true master of that art. Under the present system, you keep your Academician occupied only in producing tinted pieces of canvas to be shown in frames, and smooth pieces of marble to be placed in niches; while you expect your builder or constructor to design coloured patterns in stone and brick, and your china-ware merchant to keep a separate body of workwomen who can paint china, but nothing else. By this division of labour, you ruin all the arts at once. The work of the Academician becomes mean and effeminate, because he is not used to treat colour on a grand scale and in rough materials; and your manufactures become base because no well educated person sets hand to them. And therefore it is necessary to understand, not merely as a logical statement, but as a practical necessity, that wherever beautiful colour is to be arranged, you need a Master of Painting; and wherever noble form is to be given, a Master of Sculpture; and wherever complex mechanical force is to be resisted, a Master of Architecture.|$|E

5000|$|Monet, Sisley, Morisot, and Pissarro may be {{considered}} the [...] "purest" [...] Impressionists, in their consistent pursuit of an art of spontaneity, sunlight, and colour. Degas rejected much of this, as he believed in the primacy of drawing <b>over</b> <b>colour</b> and belittled the practice of painting outdoors. Renoir turned away from Impressionism for a time during the 1880s, and never entirely regained his commitment to its ideas. Édouard Manet, although regarded by the Impressionists as their leader, never abandoned his liberal use of black as a colour, and never participated in the Impressionist exhibitions. He continued to submit his works to the Salon, where his painting Spanish Singer had won a 2nd class medal in 1861, and he urged the others to do likewise, arguing that [...] "the Salon is the real field of battle" [...] where a reputation could be made.|$|E
50|$|It {{is clear}} the {{emphasis}} of the composition is the sky, which covers {{more than three-quarters of}} the canvas. The low-lying cloud cover reflects the tree line below and the cumulus masses gently floating upwards draw the viewers eye from the lower left to the upper right corner of the painting. The sky is reflected in the light, dancing across the calm waters. MacDonald has achieved this effect through strong strokes parallel to the distant shoreline. Even in this piece, with its muted colours and pastel tones, MacDonald shows his skilled command <b>over</b> <b>colour.</b> The water is composed of dark and light blues and greens, showing its various depth and hinting at its crystal clarity, but MacDonald has also painted creamy pinks and soft purples reflecting the multi-coloured sky above. The small strip of beach in the foreground is also rich in colour, giving it life and movement.|$|E
50|$|After 1907 Cameron's work {{showed a}} greater focus on Scottish {{landscape}} subjects and from 1908 to 1917 {{he moved from}} etching to painting. Around this time he largely stopped including figures in his compositions, apart from in his architectural studies. By this time his works were receiving wide critical acclaim and he was well known both in the UK and abroad. Around 1908 his work began to lighten in colour, prior to this Cameron's work had been criticised for being too dark with a heavy use of brown tones. Visits to France and Italy in the 1920s {{seemed to have a}} further influence on his works and brought about a much brighter palette. His painting can be characterised by an interest in tone and design <b>over</b> <b>colour</b> and detail. At the same time there was a shift in influence away from the Glasgow Boys and their decorative style and he became known for his atmospheric highland landscapes.Cameron was well known and liked in the art world and held a great many appointments to societies and boards. On the retirement of RsA president Sir James Guthrie in 1919, it was suggested that Cameron stand for the presidency. Cameron declined however, citing too many existing responsibilities in London.|$|E

50|$|The life of Stojan Aralica can be {{followed}} through his studies in Munich (1909-1914), a briefstay in Prague, advanced studies in Paris, then period in Zagreb and his final move to Belgrade in 1941. He remained in Belgrade {{for the rest}} of his life, with the exception of his stay in Stockholm from 1946 to 1948. In the same way as we can differentiate between the stages of his life, we can distinguish four clearly distinct periods in his painting opus: the Munich, Paris, Zagreb and Belgrade periods. During his education in Munich portraits and nudes prevailed thematically, and were in form close to academism and the late echoes of the Secession. The brief domination of form <b>over</b> <b>colour</b> (1922-1925) was replaced by a period of artistic maturing, beginning with his arrival in Paris (1926). Joining the active local artistic mainstream, he turned away from the decorative and towards pursuing a purely visual interest. His formerly emphasized full-volume form was slowly disintegrating into coloured surfaces. This significant turning point began with small nudes and still-lifes painted in the studio of André Lhote, and the colouristic organization of his paintings was developed on the landscapes around the countryside Malakoff, Casisse and especially St. Tropez. The necessary refinement ended in the next, the Zagreb period (1933-1941) when Aralica rejoined the current trends in his home country. His technique, which was close to that of fauvists, is particularly prominent in his seaside landscapes from Dubrovnik, Orebić, Korčula. Finally, the Belgrade period, especially between 1951 and 1959, can be considered as his creative zenith. By painting lyrical atmospheres with broad and layered impastos on a series of landscapes from Rovinj, Belgrade and more often Lika, he departed from the confines of intimistic painting, only to develop it to a monumental whole of universal significance. Although Aralica’s work was always in touch with current trends of European art, in a narrower sense it still belonged to the same climes as that of domestic colouristic painters, whose art drew its strength and inspiration from their own, native soil. He contributed to the further development of contemporary art in the second half of the twentieth century with a series of significant works painted in the years after the World War II.|$|E
40|$|In this research, {{morphological}} {{characterization of}} vineyard peach collection was conducted. In 78 accessions thirty qualitative traits of tree, flower, leaf, fruit and stone were analysed by using UPOV and ECPGR descriptors. Most of the studied traits showed {{a high degree}} of variability. The lowest variability obtained for the leaf traits, and highest for skin and flesh colour. Not only were the accessions sorted into a large number of categories by the most of their properties, but also there was a significant level of variability in the collection, reflecting {{in the fact that the}} traits were recombinant in a different way. Principal component analysis (PCA) and a dendrogram were performed to determine relationships among accessions and to obtain information on the usefulness of those characters for the discrimination. The PCA revealed that the first 4 principal components were able to represent 43. 1 % of total variance. Traits with high discriminating values comprised internal and external fruit colour, flower type and colour, flower bud density and stone shape. The cluster analysis showed that the accessions were placed in three main clusters. The greatest impact on the separation in clusters had fruit <b>over</b> <b>colour</b> and extent of fruit <b>over</b> <b>colour.</b> Moreover, the collection can also comprise some accessions with the preferred recombination of properties that might be interesting for further studies in breeding.
