One expansion incorporated undeveloped land in the southeast for an industrial park and a Louisiana-Pacific Canada veneer factory. The city extended sewer and water lines to the location; however, the area was not developed and with the factory only half-built, L-P Canada abandoned its plans. A business making manufactured homes bought the factory and completed its development in 2005. Another expansion incorporated the existing <b>oriented</b> <b>strand</b> <b>board</b> factory in {{the northwest corner of}} the city, while further incorporations have included undeveloped land to the south and north.|$|E
5|$|The main {{speakers}} may be 'flown' {{from the}} ceiling of a venue on chain hoists, and 'flying points' (i.e., attachment points) are built into many professional loudspeaker enclosures. Subwoofers can be flown or stacked on the ground near the stage. There can be more than 50 double-18-inch (45cm) cabinets in a typical concert system. Just as consumer subwoofer enclosures can be made of Medium-density fibreboard (MDF), <b>Oriented</b> <b>strand</b> <b>board</b> (OSB), plywood, plastic or other dense material, professional subwoofer enclosures can be built from the same materials. MDF is commonly used to construct subwoofers for permanent installations as its density is relatively high and weatherproofing is not a concern. Other permanent installation subwoofers have used very thick plywood: the Altec 8182 (1981) used 7-ply 28mm birch-faced oak plywood. Touring subwoofers are typically built from 18–20mm thick void-free Baltic birch (Betula pendula or Betula pubescens) plywood from Finland, Estonia or Russia; such plywood affords greater strength for frequently transported enclosures. Not naturally weatherproof, Baltic birch is coated with carpet, thick paint or spray-on truck bedliner to give the subwoofer enclosures greater durability.|$|E

Approximately 100 million cubic meters of wood was consumed for this purpose in 1991. The trends suggest that particle board and fiber board will overtake plywood.|$|E

500|$|Subwoofers {{have been}} {{designed}} using a number of enclosure approaches: bass reflex, acoustic suspension, infinite baffle, horn loaded, tapped horn, transmission line and bandpass.

2500|$|Most {{houses in}} North America are wood-framed structures. Wood {{is one of}} the best {{materials}} for earthquake-resistant construction since it is lightweight and more flexible than masonry. It is easy to work with and less expensive than steel, masonry, or concrete. [...] In older homes the most significant weaknesses are the connection from the wood-framed walls to the foundation and the relatively weak [...] "cripple-walls." [...] (Cripple walls are the short wood walls that extend from the top of the foundation to the lowest floor level in houses that have raised floors.) [...] Adding connections from the base of the wood-framed structure to the foundation is almost always an important part of a seismic retrofit. [...] Bracing the cripple-walls to resist side-to-side forces is essential in houses with cripple walls; [...] bracing is usually done with plywood. [...] <b>Oriented</b> <b>strand</b> <b>board</b> (OSB) does not perform as consistently as plywood, and is not the favored choice of retrofit designers or installers.|$|E
2500|$|Often such buildings, {{especially}} if constructed on a moderate slope, are erected {{on a platform}} connected to a perimeter foundation through low stud-walls called [...] "cripple wall" [...] or pin-up. This low wall structure itself may fail in shear or in its connections to itself at the corners, leading to the building moving diagonally and collapsing the low walls. The likelihood of failure of the pin-up can be reduced by ensuring that the corners are well reinforced in shear and that the shear panels are well connected to {{each other through the}} corner posts. This requires structural grade sheet plywood, often treated for rot resistance. This grade of plywood is made without interior unfilled knots and with more, thinner layers than common plywood. New buildings designed to resist earthquakes will typically use OSB (<b>oriented</b> <b>strand</b> <b>board),</b> sometimes with metal joins between panels, and with well attached stucco covering to enhance its performance. In many modern tract homes, especially those built upon expansive (clay) soil the building is constructed upon a single and relatively thick monolithic slab, kept in one piece by high tensile rods that are stressed after the slab has set. This poststressing places the concrete under compression – a condition under which it is extremely strong in bending and so will not crack under adverse soil conditions.|$|E

40|$|Conventional wood framing, {{also known}} as stick framing, {{has been around for}} {{hundreds}} of years. It is an easy, effective method for building new houses and small commercial projects. However, it may no longer the best option for new construction. The development of Structural Insulated Panels (SIPs) began over 70 years ago at the United States Forest Products Laboratory in Wisconsin. Scientists believed that plywood sheathing alone could provide adequate strength to support the loads a structure encounters. Over the years, SIPs have evolved to what they are today: a rigid insulation foam core sandwiched between two skins, often made of <b>oriented</b> <b>strand</b> <b>boards</b> (OSB). Compared to stick framing, SIPs are faster to erect in the field and also provide more strength to resist most loads; they are better with axial and transverse loads. Stick framing can be built more robust to resist in-plane shear loads. The quality of the material of SIPs also means better quality construction. The insulating values SIPs provide are far superior to that of fiberglass insulation used in stick framing, saving money for the owner as well as energy from natural resources.

50|$|Compared {{to other}} older Antarctic bases, {{the station is}} rather small and stands out among the often overlarge {{buildings}} previously built in Antarctica by other countries. The design of the whole complex revolves around the Climate conditions in the area. The main building is a one-storey Wooden structure (26.5 × 11.5 m, 2.8-3.6 m high) used for accommodation, cooking, and eating {{as well as for}} leisure and research activities. There are twelve single or twin rooms, two shared studies, a dining room, a small kitchen, sanitary facilities, and a drying room. There is a grating made of Oak railway sleepers embedded in the shallow foundations of the building; this structure is no less than 40 cm above the ground to reduce Heat losses caused by the cold Antarctic soil. The walls are 265 mm thick and they are built using the K-Kontrolsystem. They consist of two <b>oriented</b> <b>strand</b> <b>boards</b> with insulation filling in between the boards. The external surface of the walls is covered with Plywood to protect the structure from adverse effects of the environment (sea salt aerosol, occasional Dust storms). The floor and the ceilings are constructed in a similar way, but they are thicker - 320 mm. The roof slopes to the south at a pitch of 5% and is covered with a PVC board, which protects the building from Ultraviolet radiation.|$|R
40|$|Natural fibers are {{emerging}} {{in the fields of}} automobile and aerospace industries to replace the parts such as body panels, seats, and other parts subjected to higher bending strength. In the construction industries, they have the potential to replace the wood and <b>oriented</b> <b>strand</b> <b>boards</b> (OSB) laminates in the structural insulated panels (SIPs). They possess numerous advantages over traditional OSB SIPs such as being environmental friendly, recyclable, energy efficient, inherently flood resistant, and having higher strength and wind resistance. This paper mainly focuses on the manufacturing feasibility and structural characterization of natural fiber reinforced structural insulated panels (NSIPs) using natural fiber reinforced polymeric (NFRP) laminates as skin. To account for the use of natural fibers, the pretreatments are required on natural fibers prior to use in NFRP laminates, and, to address this issue properly, the natural fibers were given bleaching pretreatments. To this end, flexure test and low-velocity impact (LVI) tests were carried out on NSIPs in order to evaluate the response of NSIPs under sudden impact loading and uniform bending conditions typical of residential construction. The paper also includes a comparison of mechanical properties of NSIPs with OSB SIPs and G/PP SIPs. The results showed significant increase in the mechanical properties of resulting NSIP panels mainly a 53 % increase in load-carrying capacity compared to OSB SIPs. The bending modulus of NSIPs is 190 % higher than OSB SIPs and 70 % weight reduction compared to OSB SIPs...|$|R
