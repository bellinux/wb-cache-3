5|$|Ono {{was also}} an {{experimental}} filmmaker who made 16 short films between 1964 and 1972, gaining particular renown for a 1966 Fluxus film called simply No. 4, {{often referred to as}} Bottoms. The five-and-a-half-minute film consists of a series of close-ups of human buttocks walking <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>treadmill.</b> The screen is divided into four almost equal sections by the elements of the gluteal cleft and the horizontal gluteal crease. The soundtrack consists of interviews with those who are being filmed, as well as those considering joining the project. In 1996, the watch manufacturing company Swatch produced a limited edition watch that commemorated this film.|$|E

Hiking is the usual word used in Canada, the United States and South Africa for long vigorous walks; similar walks are called tramps in New Zealand, or hill walking or just walking in Australia, the UK and the Irish Republic. Australians also bushwalk. In English-speaking parts of North America the term walking is used for short walks, especially in towns and cities. Snow shoeing is walking in snow; a slightly different gait is required compared with regular walking.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} and compare the efficacy of different remobilization protocols in different skeletal muscles considering the changes induced by hindlimb suspension of the tail. Thirty-six female Wistar rats were divided into six groups: control I, control II, suspended, suspended free, suspended trained <b>on</b> <b>a</b> declined <b>treadmill</b> and suspended trained <b>on</b> <b>a</b> flat <b>treadmill.</b> Fragments of soleus and tibialis anterior (TA) muscle were frozen and processed by different histochemical methods. The suspended soleus showed a significant increase in the proportional number of intermediate/hybrid fibers and a decrease in the number of type I fibers. Some of these changes proved to be reversible after remobilization. The three remobilization programs led to the recovery of both the proportional number of fibers and their size. The TA muscle presented a significant increase in the number and size of type I fibers and a cell size reduction of type IIB fibers, which were recovered after training <b>on</b> <b>a</b> declined <b>treadmill</b> and free movement. Especially regarding the soleus, the present findings indicate that, among the protocols, training <b>on</b> <b>a</b> declined <b>treadmill</b> was found to induce changes of a more regenerative nature, seemingly indicating a better tissue restructuring after the suspension procedure...|$|R

The distance walked in 9 minutes <b>on</b> <b>a</b> self-powered <b>treadmill</b> was measured in all groups and the test was repeated to assess reproducibility.

Ten male athletes (age 24 ± 3 years, body mass 69. 8 ± 6. 91 kg, height 1. 80 ± 0. 06 m, VO 2 peak 69. 0 ± 6. 70 ml/kg/ min) conducted three 1000 m laps at increasing velocity on three different running modalities. The athletes had a 3 -minute recovery between each lap, where the rate of perceived exertion (RPE) was registered and the blood lactate concentration and heart rate were measured. Oxygen uptake was measured using a portable metabolic analyser. The physiological (oxygen uptake, heart rate, and blood lactate concentration) and perceptual (RPE) variables were higher when running <b>on</b> <b>a</b> non-motorized curved <b>treadmill</b> compared with running on the track or <b>a</b> motorized <b>treadmill.</b> No differences were found between running <b>on</b> <b>a</b> motorized <b>treadmill</b> and the track except for the RPE, which was lower when running on the track compared with the motorized <b>treadmill.</b> Running <b>on</b> <b>a</b> non-motorized curved <b>treadmill</b> at three different velocities results in a higher oxygen uptake (37 %) and heart rate (22 %) and is subjectively much harder than running <b>on</b> <b>a</b> track or <b>a</b> motorized <b>treadmill</b> at the same velocities. The difference is around 4 km/h when comparing the physiological and perceptual responses. Thus, when performing training sessions <b>on</b> <b>a</b> non-motorized curved <b>treadmill,</b> subjects should subtract 4 km/h from their regular pace <b>on</b> <b>a</b> track or motorized treadmill to get the same response considering oxygen uptake, heart rate, RPE and blood lactate concentration...|$|R
