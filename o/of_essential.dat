The list is frequently used by countries to help develop their own local lists <b>of</b> <b>essential</b> medicine. As of 2016, more than 155 countries have created national lists <b>of</b> <b>essential</b> medicines based on the World Health Organization's model list. This includes countries in both the developed and developing world.|$|E

30|$|The {{bronchodilator}} effects <b>of</b> ginger <b>essential</b> oil {{were confirmed}} on airway system. Ginger essential oil with citral, eucalyptol and camphor had relaxing effect on rat's airway and inhibited the carbachol induced rat tracheal contraction. The bronchodilator effect <b>of</b> ginger <b>essential</b> oil {{is related to}} citral, eucalyptol. The bronchodilator effects <b>of</b> ginger <b>essential</b> oil reversed by propranolol, while L-NAME and indomethacin {{had no effect on}} bronchodilator effects <b>of</b> ginger <b>essential</b> oil and citral. Propranolol is β-adrenergic receptor antagonist, while indomethacin and L- NAME were CO 2 inhibitor and NOS inhibitor. Therefore, β-adrenergic receptors were involved in bronchodilator effects <b>of</b> ginger <b>essential</b> oil [36]. The bronchodilator effects <b>of</b> ginger <b>essential</b> oil are according to traditional uses of ginger syrup for respiratory problems. The bronchodilator effects <b>of</b> ginger <b>essential</b> oil in modern medicine confirm its traditional uses for management of cough.|$|R

If possible, cells use the unmodified complementary strand of the DNA or the sister chromatid as a template to recover the original information. Without access to a template, cells use an error-prone recovery mechanism known as translesion synthesis as a last resort.|$|E
