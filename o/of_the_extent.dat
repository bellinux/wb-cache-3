5|$|After the explosion, Bennington was refloated and towed to the Mare Island Navy Yard. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> of {{the damages}} {{and the age}} of the ship, Bennington was not {{repaired}} but was instead decommissioned on 31 October 1905. After five years of inactivity, Bennington was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 10 September 1910 and sold for scrap on 14 November. Bennington was not scrapped but was purchased in 1913 by the Matson Line for use as a molasses barge. She was towed to Honolulu and remained in use there from 1913 until 1924, when she was scuttled off Oahu.|$|E

For reaction systems, the state variables (<b>the</b> numbers <b>of</b> moles, or concentrations) {{have recently been}} transformed into decoupled reaction variants (extents of reaction), and reaction invariants (extents of flow) (Amrhein et al., AIChE Journal, 2010).

5|$|The {{unblemished}} musculature of {{the central}} figure waving to the rescue ship {{is reminiscent of the}} Neoclassical, however the naturalism of light and shadow, the authenticity of the desperation shown by the survivors and the emotional character of the composition differentiate it from Neoclassical austerity. It was a further departure from the religious or classical themes of earlier works because it depicted contemporary events with ordinary and unheroic figures. Both the choice of subject matter and the heightened manner in which the dramatic moment is depicted are typical of Romantic painting—strong indications <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> to which Géricault had moved from the prevalent Neoclassical movement.|$|E

Common ravens are known for spectacular aerobatic displays, such as flying in loops or interlocking talons with each other in flight.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{evidence}} that Æthelberht's influence in other kingdoms was enough for him to convert any other kings to Christianity, although this is partly {{due to the lack of}} sources—nothing is known of Sussex's history, for example, for almost all of the seventh and eighth centuries. Æthelberht was able to arrange a meeting in 602 in the Severn valley, on the northwestern borders of Wessex, however, and this may be an indication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> of his influence in the west. No evidence survives showing Kentish domination of Mercia, but it is known that Mercia was independent of Northumbria, so it is quite plausible that it was under Kentish overlordship.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The Data {{distribution}} Mechanism (DDM) {{defined in}} HLA relies strongly on computing the intersections between subscription and update regions. There {{are some very}} efficient algorithms to compute intersections, however, these algorithms are still time consuming and their average complexity is quadratic; so they are {{not good enough for}} scenarios where the regions have {{a very large number of}} extents. Moreover, these algorithms are usually designed to find all the intersections, while the DDM needs only to know if there is at least one. From an initial set of experiments, we highlight the fact that <b>the</b> efficiency <b>of</b> each algorithm varies greatly, depending on <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>extents</b> in <b>the</b> routing space. For instance, the brute force (checking the intersections in a random sequence) is particularly bad when there are few intersections but it is quite good when there are many intersections. The grid-based algorithm (partitioning the routing space with a regular grid before checking the intersections) has almost the opposite behaviour. The sort-based algorithm (sorting <b>the</b> <b>extents</b> according to their coordinates in each dimension) is not really affected. This gives us the first elements to build an adaptive DDM: before <b>the</b> actual computation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intersection, we try to guess approximately <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> distributions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>extents</b> in <b>the</b> routing space; then we use the algorithm which is usually the best for this distribution. If <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>extents</b> is not uniform over the whole routing space, an initial partitioning can be initially done to use the best algorithm on each different region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> routing space. 1...|$|R

5|$|Amundsen's initial plans {{had focused}} on the Arctic and the conquest of the North Pole {{by means of an}} {{extended}} drift in an icebound ship. He obtained the use of Fridtjof Nansen's polar exploration ship Fram, and undertook extensive fundraising. Preparations for this expedition were disrupted when, in 1909, the rival American explorers Frederick Cook and Robert E. Peary each claimed to have reached the North Pole. Amundsen then changed his plan and began to prepare for a conquest of the South Pole; uncertain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> to which the public and his backers would support him, he kept this revised objective secret. When he set out in June1910, he led even his crew to believe they were embarking on an Arctic drift, and revealed their true Antarctic destination only when Fram was leaving their last port of call, Madeira.|$|E
5|$|Both teams {{started with}} a 4–4–2 {{formation}} and it was Liverpool that kicked the final off. Five minutes into the match, Liverpool defender Gerry Byrne and Leeds captain Bobby Collins collided, which resulted in Byrne breaking his collarbone. As substitutions were not allowed, Byrne decided to continue playing. He was unaware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> of his injury, as manager Shankly decided against telling him. The first action of the match was from a Liverpool free-kick, which Willie Stevenson played into the Leeds penalty area. Leeds goalkeeper Gary Sprake and defender Jack Charlton did not deal with it and it went out of play for a Liverpool corner. Liverpool captain Ron Yeats headed the ball on from the corner and striker Ian St. John was close to reaching it, before it was gathered by Sprake. Leeds {{were trying to get}} winger Albert Johanneson into the match, but a pass to him from Johnny Giles was intercepted by Liverpool defender Tommy Smith. He passed to Ian Callaghan, who advanced before passing to Stevenson, he and Smith exchanged passes before Stevenson passed to Callaghan, whose shot was saved by Sprake.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, after {{retiring}} from her NUGMW post, Bondfield founded the Women's Group on Public Welfare. She studied labour {{conditions in the}} United States and Mexico during 1938, and toured the US and Canada after the outbreak of war in 1939, as a lecturer for the British Information Services. Her attitude towards the war was different from her semi-pacifist stance of 1914; she actively supported the government and, in 1941, published a booklet, Why Labour Fights. Her main wartime activity was leading {{an investigation by the}} Hygiene Committee of the Women's Group on Public Welfare, into the problems that arose from the large-scale evacuation into the countryside of city children. The group's findings were published in 1943, as Our Towns: a Close-up; the report gave many people their first understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> of inner-city poverty. Suggested solutions included nursery education, a minimum wage, child allowances and a national health service. The report was reprinted several times, and was instrumental in developing support for the social reforms introduced by the Labour government that took office in 1945. Among Bondfield's other wartime activities, in 1944 she helped to launch a national drive for the appointment of more women police officers.|$|E

5|$|Liddell {{entered the}} youth team on {{his arrival in}} 1938. Before he {{established}} himself in the side, Liddell had been frustrated at the frequent rotation of players until trainer Albert Shelley advised him to be patient. An injury incurred against Blackburn Rovers threatened to end his career prematurely. He had struck his knee against concrete near the corner flag after being challenged while running with the ball. Doctors informed him <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> of tissue damage, causing Liddell anxiety about his future. He remained in Blackburn for two weeks, living in the family home of a colleague, before returning to Liverpool to continue his recovery. The Second World War precluded an official debut for Liddell, as the Football Association suspended competitive football from the abandoned 1939–1940 season and instituted a regional system in its place. Until the cessation of hostilities in 1945, Liddell guested for various domestic sides when unavailable for Liverpool and represented select teams, including a Football Association XI and Scottish Services XI. Liddell was capped eight times for Scotland during the war, scoring on his debut in a 5–4 win over England in 1942.|$|E
5|$|Not all the {{locations}} {{named in the}} Chronicle can be identified, but {{it is apparent that}} the West Saxons were fighting in north Somerset, south Gloucestershire, and north Wiltshire, against both British and Mercian opposition.

Evidently these monasteries were in West Saxon territory by then. Exeter, to the west, in Devon, was under West Saxon control by 680, since Boniface was educated there at about that time.|$|E
