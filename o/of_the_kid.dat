50|$|As {{noted above}} {{concerning}} the ending, {{the most common}} interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> novel is that Holden kills <b>the</b> <b>kid</b> in a Fort Griffin, Texas, outhouse. The fact that <b>the</b> <b>kid's</b> death is not depicted might be significant. Blood Meridian is a catalog of brutality, depicting, in sometimes explicit detail, all manner of violence, bloodshed, brutality and cruelty. For the dramatic climax to be left undepicted leaves something of a vacuum for the reader: knowing full well the horrors established in <b>the</b> past hundreds <b>of</b> pages, <b>the</b> <b>kid's</b> unstated fate might still be too awful to describe, and {{too much for the}} mind to fathom: <b>the</b> sight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kid's</b> fate leaves several witnesses stunned almost to silence; never in the book does any other character have this response to violence, again underlining <b>the</b> singularity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kid's</b> fate.|$|R

25|$|Pat Garrett, smarting {{from local}} outrage over his {{shooting}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kid,</b> wanted {{to present his}} side of the story and hoped to turn a profit as well on the American public's fascination with the notorious outlaw. Consequently, he published his account of Bonney's life, The Authentic Life of Billy, the Kid, in 1882. It was credited to Garrett, but the first fifteen chapters were a concoction of factual material mixed with fabrications, written by Roswell's postmaster, Ash Upson, an itinerant journalist. The remaining chapters, written in a more restrained style, are generally accurate, and were likely composed by Garrett himself. The book failed to find a wide audience and sold just a few copies; nevertheless, although filled with many errors of fact, The Authentic Life served afterwards as the main source for most books written about the Kid until the 1960s. Thus was established the mythic stature of Pat Garrett as the heroic lawman in pursuit of the villainous but romantic desperado, Billy the Kid.|$|E

500|$|In {{literature}} Tunis' contributions {{have sometimes}} been direct. His baseball books, especially The Kid from Tomkinsville, {{have been cited}} as one source of inspiration for Bernard Malamud's book The Natural, about baseball star Roy Hobbs. Among other similarities, both Hobbs and Tucker started as pitchers but, thanks to accidents, ended up as outfielders and power-hitters. It has been suggested by Michele Schiavone in her study of Tunis' influence on Malamud and Roth that, as an early fan of the Dodgers, Malamud was familiar with Tunis' books and borrowed from them, [...] "consciously or not". Bruce Brooks' introduction to the 1987 edition <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Kid</b> from Tomkinsville [...] says that Tunis [...] "obviously" [...] inspired Mark Harris, author of Bang the Drum Slowly. And in what D. G. Myers in Best Baseball Books Ever called [...] "one of the best pieces of (literary) criticism ever written", The Kid from Tomkinsville is referenced by Nathan Zuckerman, the main character in Philip Roth's novel American Pastoral. For Zuckerman, Tunis' book and pitcher Roy Tucker become what Schiavone called [...] "a template for Zuckerman's view of the Swede", and his realization of the [...] "tragic underside to the American Dream".|$|E

He becomes Spider-Man. Garfield described Parker as someone he can relate to and stated that the character had been an important influence on him since he was little. [...] Garfield drew from his life experiences as inspiration for the role, revealing, [...] "I was thinking of my history and thinking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kid</b> at school who I wasn't as strong as, who behaved badly to a lot of people– including myself– and who I constantly tried to stand up to but never had the physical prowess to". Discussing his predecessor, Garfield said he respects Tobey Maguire as an actor and that when he first saw Maguire play Spider-Man he [...] "was blown away by his interpretation." [...] Garfield said in interviews, including one in which he was interviewed by Maguire, that when he watched the film Spider-Man when he was younger, he would jokingly recite Maguire's lines in the mirror with a friend who joked that he would never be Spider-Man. On accepting the role Garfield explained, [...] "I see it as a massive challenge in many ways... To make it authentic. To make the character live and breathe in a new way. The audience already has a relationship with many different incarnations of the character. I do, as well. I'm probably going to be the guy in the movie theater shouting abuse at myself. But I have to let that go. No turning back. And I wouldn't want to." [...] After taking the role, Garfield studied the movements of athletes and spiders and tried to incorporate them, saying Parker is [...] "a boy/spider in terms of how he moves, and not just in the suit." [...] He did yoga and Pilates for the role in order to be as flexible as possible. When first wearing his costume Garfield admitted to shedding tears and trying to imagine [...] "a better actor in the suit", which he described as [...] "uncomfortable" [...] and admitted to wearing nothing beneath it since it is skintight. When filming Garfield explained that he had four months of training and described his physical roles on stunts as terribly challenging and exhausting.|$|E

2500|$|The modern {{legend of}} Billy the Kid as an immortal {{figure of the}} Old West first {{developed}} within a larger cultural context of social upheaval in the late 19th and early 20th century United States. Between 1897 and 1909, during the Progressive era [...] of political activism and reform, the popular American novelist Emerson Hough wrote magazine articles, novels and informal histories that reintroduced Billy the Kid to a national audience, albeit in works that often relied more on fantasy than on actual events. Hough embellished the Kid's reputation with lurid descriptions of his exceptional villainy in an article called [...] "Billy the Kid: The True Story of a Western 'Bad Man' [...] ", written in 1901 for the literary publication, Everybody's Magazine, using language like [...] "the soul of some fierce and far-off carnivor got {{into the body of}} this little man, this boy, this fiend in tight boots and a broad hat." [...] Hough further developed this image <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> in his book about western desperados, The Story of the Outlaw (1907), though not in such excessive language.|$|E
2500|$|The Jews were {{so widely}} {{scattered}} in the Middle Ages {{that it is}} difficult to give a connected account of their mode of living as regards food. In Arabic countries the author of the Halakhot Gedolot knew some dishes that appear to have been specific Jewish foods, e.g., [...] "paspag", which was, perhaps, biscuit; according to the Siddur Amram, the well-known [...] "ḥaroset" [...] is made in those countries from a mixture of herbs, flour, and honey (Arabic,"ḥalikah"). Maimonides, in his [...] "Sefer Refu'ot", mentions dishes that are good for health. He recommends bread baked from wheat that is not too new, nor too old, nor too fine, further, the meat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kid,</b> sheep, and chicken, and the yolks of eggs. Goats' and cows' milk is good, nor are cheese and butter harmful. Honey is good for old people; fish with solid white flesh meat is wholesome; so also are wine and dried fruits. Fresh fruits, however, are unwholesome; and he does not recommend garlic or onions.|$|E
2500|$|The film {{director}} Sam Peckinpah attempted an ambitious retelling of the legend {{in his last}} western film, Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1973), covering {{the last few months}} of Bonney's life, in which the violence and physical brutality of the world the protagonists inhabited is portrayed realistically. The film suffered from production difficulties as well as from Peckinpah's battles with MGM over his artistic vision and budget overruns. The studio's drastically cut release version, disowned by Peckinpah, was initially a failure with major critics and the viewing public. Although its depiction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> as a roguish anarchist opposed to illegitimate law (as enforced by Garrett on behalf of a corrupt power structure) was suited to the temper of the times, it quickly left first-run theaters. Soon, however, reviews began to appear in smaller film magazines and journals in the United States and abroad that praised its artistry and breadth of vision. The film's reputation was on the ascendancy long before Peckinpah's preferred cut of the preview version was finally shown at the University of Southern California in 1986, and its critical stature has continued to increase since—Martin Scorsese, e.g., called it a [...] "masterpiece". Despite the liberties it took with history, scholar and film editor Paul Seydor described Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid as among the finest treatments of the legend in any medium.|$|E
