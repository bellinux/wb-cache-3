5|$|Beyoncé and {{her mother}} {{introduced}} House of Deréon, a contemporary women's fashion line, in 2005. The concept is inspired by three generations of women in their family, with the name paying tribute to Beyoncé's grandmother, Agnèz Deréon, a respected seamstress. According to Tina, the overall style of the line best reflects her and Beyoncé's taste and style. Beyoncé {{and her mother}} founded their family's company Beyond Productions, which provides the licensing and brand management for House of Deréon, and its junior collection, Deréon. House of Deréon pieces were exhibited in Destiny's Child's shows and tours, during their Destiny Fulfilled era. The collection features sportswear, denim offerings with fur, <b>outerwear</b> and accessories that include handbags and footwear, and are available at department and specialty stores across the US and Canada.|$|E

25|$|Women’s {{fashion in}} the Regency era {{started to change}} drastically. It popularized the empire silhouette, which {{featured}} a fitted bodice and high waist. This “new natural style” emphasized {{the beauty of the}} body's natural lines. Clothing became lighter and easier to care for than in the past. Women often wore several layers of clothing, typically undergarments, gowns, and <b>outerwear.</b> The chemise, the standard undergarment of the era, prevented the thin, gauzy dresses from being fully transparent. <b>Outerwear,</b> such as the spencer and the pelisse, were popular.|$|E

25|$|The tank top, an undershirt {{named after}} the type of {{swimwear}} dating from the 1920s known as a tank suit or maillot, became popular warm-weather casual <b>outerwear</b> in the US in the 1980s. Performers such as Madonna and Cyndi Lauper were also often seen wearing their undergarments on top of other clothes.|$|E
25|$|Infants' {{garments}} {{similar to}} blanket sleepers, but {{designed for use}} as <b>outerwear</b> rather than sleepwear (and usually featuring hoods and hand covers), are referred to by other terms such as pram suit, snowsuit, or carriage suit. Some such garments are designed for dual use as both sleepwear and playwear, these are sometimes known as sleep 'n' play suits.|$|E
25|$|There are now an {{unprecedented}} array of styles and models, including full-coverage bras, balconette cup bras that expose the aerolas and nipples, and sports bras that {{can sometimes be}} worn as <b>outerwear.</b> Women, health professionals, feminists and fashion writers appear to be increasingly questioning its place and function, and asking whether it will {{go the way of}} pantyhose, garter belts and stockings.|$|E
25|$|Outside the fetish community, {{living history}} re-enactors and {{historic}} costume enthusiasts still wear stays and corsets {{according to their}} original purpose to give the proper shape to the figure when wearing historic fashions. In this case, the corset is underwear rather than <b>outerwear.</b> Skilled corset makers are available to make reproductions of historic corset shapes or to design new styles.|$|E
25|$|The corset {{fell from}} fashion in the 1920s in Europe and North America, {{replaced}} by girdles and elastic brassieres, but survived as {{an article of}} costume. Originally an item of lingerie, the corset has become a popular item of <b>outerwear</b> in the fetish, BDSM and goth subcultures. In the fetish and BDSM literature, there is often much emphasis on tightlacing, and many corset makers cater to the fetish market.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the late}} 1980s, the corset has {{experienced}} periodic revivals, all which have usually originated in haute couture and have occasionally trickled through to mainstream fashion. These revivals {{focus on the}} corset as an item of <b>outerwear</b> rather than underwear. The strongest of these revivals {{was seen in the}} Autumn 2001 fashion collections and coincided with the release of the film Moulin Rouge!; the costumes featured many corsets as characteristic of the era. Another fashion movement, which has renewed interest in the corset, is the Steampunk culture that utilizes late-Victorian fashion shapes in new ways.|$|E
25|$|Undergarments are {{items of}} {{clothing}} worn beneath outer clothes, usually in {{direct contact with}} the skin, although they may comprise more than a single layer. They serve to keep outer garments from being soiled or damaged by bodily excretions, to lessen the friction of <b>outerwear</b> against the skin, to shape the body, and to provide concealment or support for parts of it. In cold weather, long underwear is sometimes worn to provide additional warmth. Special types of undergarments have religious significance. Some items of clothing are designed as undergarments, while others, such as T-shirts and certain types of shorts, are appropriate both as undergarments and as outer clothing. If made of suitable material or textile, some undergarments can serve as nightwear or swimsuits, and some are intended for sexual attraction or visual appeal.|$|E
25|$|During {{this time}} period, women's {{clothing}} was much thinner {{than in the}} eighteenth century so warmer <b>outerwear</b> became important in fashion, especially in colder climates. Coat-like garments such as pelisses and redingotes were popular, as were shawls, mantles, mantelets, capes and cloaks. The mantelet was a short cape that was eventually lengthened and made into a shawl. The redingote, another popular example, was a full-length garment resembling a man's riding coat (hence the name) in style, that could be made of different fabrics and patterns. Throughout the period, the Indian shawl was the favoured wrap, as houses and the typical English country house were generally draughty, and the sheer muslin and light silk dresses popular during this time provided less protection. Shawls were made of soft cashmere or silk or even muslin for summer. Paisley patterns were extremely popular at the time.|$|E
25|$|Many {{survivors}} found {{a temporary}} haven in the First Precinct station house. After a Brooklyn Eagle reporter found her dazed near the Washington Street entrance, Kate Claxton was taken there. Dressed only in thin theatrical garb, she {{huddled in the}} station house. The enormous disaster would occur to her only in small, incongruous pieces. Sitting quietly in Captain Smith's office, she would suddenly mourn for some lost article of clothing, her seal skin sacque or jewelry. Later on, the thought that {{she had lost her}} purse and was penniless would haunt her. From time to time people would enter and she would ask them about H. S. Murdoch, the actor who had been on stage with her during her final minutes inside and who had rushed to his dressing room for <b>outerwear.</b> No one had seen him; she would beseech the person to go look for him. Eventually a waterproof cloak was found for her and she was driven to her rooms at Pierrepoint House.|$|E

He has no effects of the incident besides memory loss of the incident itself. (Common in hypothermia cases.)

[...] White kid gloves have never been standard with black tie, remaining exclusive to white tie dress.|$|E
2500|$|The current working {{uniform of}} the Coast Guard is the Operational Dress Uniform (ODU). The ODU may be worn year-round {{primarily}} as a field utility and watchstanding uniform, but may also be worn in an office environment where appropriate. The ODU {{is similar to the}} Battle Dress Uniform of other armed services, both in function and style. However, the ODU is in a solid dark blue with no camouflage pattern and does not have lower pockets on the blouse. The first generation ODU, in service from 2004 to 2012, was worn tucked in. The second generation ODU is worn untucked and has black Coast Guard insignia embroidered on the left shirt pocket as well as the side pockets of the trousers. The ODU is worn with composite-toed boots in most circumstances, but low-cut brown boat shoes may be prescribed for certain vessel boarding operations. A standard baseball-style ball cap is worn, embroidered in gold block lettering with [...] "U.S. Coast Guard." [...] Units may also additionally authorize ball caps with the unit name embroidered for wear while on the unit. A foul weather parka is the <b>outerwear</b> worn with the ODU. The ODU's success and practicality as a working uniform has led the U.S. Public Health Service and the NOAA Corps to adopt ODU variants as standard working uniforms. Some Navy personnel also advocated adoption of the ODU as a standard shipboard uniform for the Navy, rather than the unpopular Navy Working Uniform Type I.|$|E

[...] "You {{can go back and}} see pictures of him in cowboy boots and a cowboy hat and a nice button-down shirt, but then again you can see him in a tux and a collared shirt with rhinestones on it and slacks.

[...] Target has announced that a William Rast collection, including denim, <b>outerwear</b> and sportswear for men and women, would launch in December and be available for a month. In 2015, the clothing line earned him a Lord & Taylor's Fashion Oracle Award at the Fashion Group International's Night of The Stars Gala. An avid amateur golfer, in 2007 Timberlake purchased the run-down Big Creek Golf Course in his home town of Millington, Tennessee, which he redeveloped as the eco-friendly Mirimichi Golf Course at a cost of some $US16 million. It was reopened on July 25, 2009 but closed again on January 15, 2010 for further improvements expected to take six months. In October 2011, Timberlake received the Futures Award at the Environmental Media Awards for his green-conscious golf course. It was reported on November 7, 2014, that Timberlake had sold Mirimichi to Three Star Leasing LLC for $500,000. Timberlake and his wife Jessica Biel are minority owners of the Memphis Grizzlies.|$|E
