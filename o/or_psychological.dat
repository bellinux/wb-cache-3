5|$|Denial of {{responsibility}} via language that obscures awareness of personal responsibility. It {{is said that}} we deny responsibility for our actions when we attribute their cause to: vague impersonal forces ("I had to"); our condition, diagnosis, personal <b>or</b> <b>psychological</b> history; the actions of others; the dictates of authority; group pressure; institutional policy, rules, and regulations; gender roles, social roles, or age roles; or uncontrollable impulses.|$|E
5|$|For {{persistent}} {{low back}} pain, the short-term outcome is also positive, with {{improvement in the}} first six weeks but very little improvement after that. At one year, those with chronic low back pain usually continue to have moderate pain and disability.

5|$|The {{development}} of factitious disorders in online venues is made easier by {{the availability of}} medical literature on the Internet, the anonymous and malleable nature of online identities, {{and the existence of}} communication forums established {{for the sole purpose of}} giving support to members facing significant health <b>or</b> <b>psychological</b> problems. Several high-profile cases have demonstrated behavior patterns which are common among those who pose as gravely ill or as victims of violence, or whose deaths are announced to online forums. The virtual communities that were created to give support, as well as general non-medical communities, often express genuine sympathy and grief for the purported victims. When fabrications are suspected or confirmed, the ensuing discussion can create schisms in online communities, destroying some and altering the trusting nature of individual members in others.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of ways to {{classify}} low back pain with no consensus that any one method is best. There are three general types of low back pain by cause: mechanical back pain (including nonspecific musculoskeletal strains, herniated discs, compressed nerve roots, degenerative discs or joint disease, and broken vertebra), non-mechanical back pain (tumors, inflammatory conditions such as spondyloarthritis, and infections), and referred pain from internal organs (gallbladder disease, kidney stones, kidney infections, and aortic aneurysm, among others). Mechanical or musculoskeletal problems underlie most cases (around 90% or more), and of those, most (around 75%) do not have a specific cause identified, but are thought to be due to muscle strain or injury to ligaments. Rarely, complaints of low back pain result from systemic <b>or</b> <b>psychological</b> problems, such as fibromyalgia and somatoform disorders.|$|E
