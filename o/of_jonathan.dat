5|$|Motte v Faulkner (decided 28 November 1735) was a {{copyright}} lawsuit between Benjamin Motte and George Faulkner over {{who had the}} legal rights to publish the works <b>of</b> <b>Jonathan</b> Swift in London. This trial {{was one of the}} first to test the Statute of Anne copyright law in regards to Irish publishing independence. Although neither held the copyright to all of Swift's works, the suit became a legal struggle over Irish rights, which were eventually denied by the English courts. Faulkner, in 1735, published the Works <b>of</b> <b>Jonathan</b> Swift in Dublin. However, a few of the works were under Motte's copyright within the Kingdom of Great Britain, and when Faulkner sought to sell his book in London, Motte issued a formal complaint to Jonathan Swift and then proceeded to sue Faulkner. An injunction was issued in Motte's favor, and the book was prohibited from being sold on British soil. The basis of the law protected the rights of the author, and not the publisher, of the works, and Swift was unwilling to support a lawsuit against Faulkner. With Swift's reaction used as a basis, the lawsuit was later seen as a struggle between the rights of Irishmen to print material that were denied under English law.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{begins in}} 1989 when a meteor shower hits Smallville; {{at the same}} time a small spacecraft, {{containing}} an alien boy, crashes in front <b>of</b> <b>Jonathan</b> and Martha Kent's (played by John Schneider and Annette O'Toole) truck. They adopt the superhumanly powerful child and name him Clark. Gough and Millar use this opening scene to establish that the three lead characters of the series, Clark, Lana and Lex, share a common bond—they are all without one or both parents: Clark is the only survivor of his homeworld; Lana's parents are killed in the meteor shower; and Lex is alienated from his father, Lionel Luthor (John Glover), after being rendered bald by the meteor blast.|$|E
