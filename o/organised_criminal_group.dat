40|$|In {{order to}} develop an {{effective}} criminal justice response, {{it is crucial to}} truly understand the phenomena at hand. The analysis of the two phenomena singled out for this contribution – namely trafficking in persons and smuggling of migrants – will be focussed at trying to understand {{the nature and extent of}} the involvement of <b>organised</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>groups</b> therein. To that end, this article explores what we know, what we do not know and what we should know about the involvement of <b>organised</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>groups</b> in trafficking in persons and smuggling of migrants. The relationship between organised crime and trafficking in persons, and the relationship between organised crime and smuggling of migrants, is taken into consideration on a multitude of levels. Additionally, serving as a significant counter-weight for organised involvement, it is stressed that a significant role is reserved for un-organised criminality in these phenomena. Because of its importance, this aspect is equally explored and its consequences for criminal justice responses are analysed.

40|$|It is {{frequently}} assumed that <b>organised</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>groups</b> are heavily implicated in trafficking in persons. However, this assumption remains relatively untested. As {{the response to}} trafficking in persons continues to grow both globally and nationally, increased information is available about {{the people involved in}} the trafficking process, their level of organisation, their offending methods and their connections with other forms of criminality.

40|$|Scholars {{have long}} made two claims: ethnic-Chinese {{criminal}} entrepreneurs have replaced traditional organised crime in transnational criminal markets including in high-level drug trafficking; {{there is no}} discernible structure or commonality (other than the desire for profit) among these informally organised criminals. This study assesses the validity of these assertions by investigating the Big Circle Boys (BCB) in Canada, drawing on qualitative data gathered {{from the field and}} from official documents. The BCB is found to be a decentralised network of career criminals comprised of illegal immigrants from Guangzhou, China. Their numbers have been steadily declining since the late 1990 s. Among other activities, the BCB are found to be mainly involved in the drug markets, where they have competitively dominated the heroin trade during the 1990 s. They do not fit the models of <b>organised</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>group</b> or mafia, but are classified to be a communal business based on Natarajan and Belanger's (1998) typology; this is attributed to their highly connected and collaborative core network comprised of BCB individuals and BCB cell leaders. Other overlapping typological categories found in their cellular network include those of freelance criminal, family business, and corporation. The BCB's violent reputation is not found to be superficial due to documented violent conducts, despite the false perpetuation of this image at times by non-BCB criminals. Internally, the BCB are capable of managing relations and resolving disputes without resorting to violence. The sources of their trust are derived from a combination of achieved and preordained ties, both of which have strong (sub) cultural underpinnings in the Chinese notion of guanxi and the Western concept of social capital. A third BCB generation is not likely to emerge primarily {{due to the lack of}} historical and sociocultural conditions which gave rise to the two earlier generations as explained by various classic criminological theories. </p...|$|E

40|$|Much {{research}} has focused on the official government policies of India and Pakistan towards Kashmir. Many choose to focus on the political process, prospects for a peaceful resolution, diplomatic hurdles, or the impact that the stalemate has on the economies of the parties involved. Surprisingly little attention in the West has been paid to several notable Pakistani non-state actors who are increasingly operating on their own and who have the potential to greatly inhibit, if not derail, the peace process between India and Pakistan. This research project will focus on Dawood Ibrahim and D-Company for a variety of reasons. For one, D-Company is the largest organised criminal syndicate in Asia. Its network spans the globe and has operations in India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Thailand, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and South Africa, amongst others. Secondly, D-Company controls much of the smuggling activity at key ports such as Mumbai, Karachi, and Dubai. Further, D-Company is unique in that {{it is one of the}} only criminal syndicates to only include members from a particular religious background (Islam), to have its most senior leadership based overseas (primarily in Karachi), to consist of members ready and willing to attack their own country (India), and to have blurred the line between an <b>organised</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>group</b> and a terrorist network. In-addition to narcotics and weapons trafficking, extortion, racketeering, money laundering and contract killings, D-Company has permitted Al-Qaeda and Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) to use its smuggling routes. The decision was made to focus on the activites of LeT over other Kashmir-centred militant groups because LeT is often referred to as the largest group operating within Indian territory and has the stongest links with D-Company, a relationship facilitated and nurtured by the ISI. This research challenges the conventional wisdom that TTP and Al-Qaeda are Pakistan's most serious security challenges. LeT has benefitted from decades of state patronage and military training, enjoys strong relationships with criminal syndicates and other terrorist groups (Pakistani and otherwise) and, critically, enjoys a favourable perception amongst everyday Pakistanis due to its carefully crafted image of being on the frontline against a hostile India. Neither Al-Qaeda nor the TTP have the level of domestic sympathy of LeT. This research is highly relevant to policymaking in that it attempts to focus attention on a dynamic of the Kashmir impasse that receives an inadequate amount of attention. Although the role of regular military forces are not to be discounted, many of the non-state actors in 1 HK, such as LeT, are also very powerful but are not confined by the same restraints as state forces, thus allowing them engage in more violent actions without as much fear of reprisal. LeT is unlikely to be affected by economic sanctions or arms embargoes and neither is D-Company. In order for lawmakers, security personnel, and other Kashmir watchers to develop a sound, comprehensive policy, this underworld relationship and its potential to undermine political initiatives must be fully appreciated.

40|$|What {{should we}} make of legislators who equate people {{smuggling}} with human trafficking, asks Savitri Taylor PEOPLE SMUGGLING {{is a matter of}} considerable political concern to Western governments, and has received much international attention in recent years. This is evidenced by the fact that 119 states, including Australia, have become parties to the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. Article 3 (a) of the Smuggling Protocol defines “smuggling of migrants” as “the procurement, in order to obtain, directly or indirectly, a financial or other material benefit, of the illegal entry of a person into a State Party of which the person is not a national or a permanent resident”. The Protocol refers to a profit motive again in article 6, which requires state parties to criminalise smuggling and related activities where committed by an <b>organised</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>group</b> and transnational in nature. The reference to a profit motive was included {{in order to ensure that}} those assisting migrants or asylum seekers on humanitarian grounds or on the basis of close family ties would not be caught by the Protocol’s provisions. Section 73. 1 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code, which implements Australia’s Smuggling Protocol obligations, makes it an offence punishable by up to ten years’ imprisonment for a person to organize or facilitate the entry of another person into a foreign country contrary to the laws of that country in exchange for direct or indirect benefit. In contrast, a profit motive is not an element of the offences created by 232 A (organisation or facilitation of irregular entry of five or more persons) and 233 (participation in any instance of irregular entry) of Australia 2 ̆ 7 s Migration Act to deal with people smuggling into Australia, though these offences carry penalties of up to twenty years and up to ten years of imprisonment respectively. In practice, too, Australian authorities have shown no reluctance in pursuing convictions against persons lacking such motive. Of course, many of those who engage in people smuggling to Australia do have a profit motive. But even here moral distinctions can surely be drawn between organisers and foot soldiers. Although the Australian Federal Police attempt to make organisers the focus of their investigation and prosecution of offences against the Migration Act, most of those actually prosecuted for people smuggling offences thus far have been the foot soldiers, that is to say the crews of suspected illegal entry vessels, or SIEVs. These crews are usually Indonesian fishers who have had to turn to alternative sources of income. During the twentieth century substantial changes to the international law of the sea pushed out the borders of Australian waters into the traditional fishing grounds of Indonesian fishers. While some allowance has been made for traditional fishing activity in a memorandum of understanding between Australia and Indonesia, the Australian interpretation of “traditional” fishing is unreasonably restrictive. In consequence, many Indonesian fishers find themselves convicted of illegal fishing and imprisoned for long periods in Australia for non-payment of fines set well beyond their means or wildest dreams. Upon completion of their sentences they are returned to Indonesia without the fishing boats (which are confiscated by Australian authorities) and without fishing income, but with the need to pay off the debts that that their families were forced to incur in their absence, not to mention the continuing need to provide for their families. The fishers placed in these straits have little choice but to turn to people smuggling. Since they receive payment up-front, their families are at least left better able to survive any time they may spend in Australian jails. To the annoyance of the Howard government, a justified compassion for the circumstances of SIEV crews inclined Australian judges toward leniency in their sentencing. The government therefore amended the Migration Act to ensure that judges did not have the choice of following their inclination. Since 27 September 2001, the Act has specified mandatory minimum penalties for adults convicted of offences under section 232 A and also specified that a court cannot choose to discharge adults it is satisfied committed such offences without proceeding to conviction. Given that Mr Rudd has labeled those who fall foul of the Act’s people smuggling provisions as the “vilest form of human life,” one suspects that none of the provisions just discussed are likely to be changed on his watch. It is true that Mr Rudd’s outburst was a response to the tragedy which befell SIEV 36, and it is important, of course, that those who expose others to risk of death or serious harm should face penalties calculated to deter such behaviour. Article 6 (3) of the Smuggling Protocol, in fact, requires states parties to establish as aggravated offences, people smuggling undertaken in circumstances which “endanger, or are likely to endanger, the lives or safety of the migrants concerned” or that “entail inhuman or degrading treatment, including for exploitation, of such migrants. ” In order to implement Australia’s obligations under the Protocol, section 73. 2 of the Criminal Code provides that a person is guilty of the aggravated offence of people smuggling, if he or she is guilty of the offence in section 73. 1 and intended exploitation of the smuggled person after entry into the foreign country, or in the course of smuggling subjected the person to cruel or inhuman treatment or exposed the person to a risk of the death or serious harm. The aggravated offence is punishable by up to twenty years’ imprisonment. Recollect, though, that Criminal Code offences relate to the smuggling of individuals into foreign countries. By contrast the Migration Act, which deals with smuggling into Australia, does not provide for the imposition of more severe penalties if the offences involve exploitation, cruel treatment or endangerment of smuggled persons. This may not be too great an omission since such conduct will usually involve prosecutable offences under the general criminal law. Nevertheless, the omission does lead one to wonder whether it is really the hapless irregular migrants’ plight or simply the protection of Australia’s borders which is foremost in the mind of Australian legislators responding to the phenomenon of people smuggling. These misgivings are only enhanced when one considers the manner in which Australia has dealt with human trafficking. The Protocol to Prevent Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons Especially Women and Children, supplementing the UN Convention against Transnational Crime, has 130 states parties. Australia is one of those parties, but only joined in 14 October 2005, despite the fact that the treaty has been in force generally since 25 December 2003 (and that Australia did not have any difficulty becoming a party to the Smuggling Protocol in 2004 within months of that Protocol entering into force generally). The Trafficking Protocol defines “trafficking in persons” as “the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation. ” It elaborates that “[e]xploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs. ” Conduct falling within this definition truly is morally egregious. Division 271 Subdivision B of the Criminal Code implements Australia’s obligation under the Trafficking Protocol to criminalise human trafficking into or out of Australia. The use of force, threats or deception in procuring the entry into or exit from Australia by another person is punishable by up to twelve years’ imprisonment. Where there is intention to exploit the victim or the victim is subjected to cruel or inhuman treatment or exposed to a risk of death or serious harm in the course of the offence the penalty increases to up to twenty years imprisonment. Though few would complain about the severity of these trafficking penalties, it is to be hoped that the Australian public may start to question the political agendas (not to mention moral sensibilities) of legislators who think fit to equate people smuggling with human trafficking in criminal law and public discourse. • Savitri Taylor is a Senior Lecturer in the School of Law at La Trobe Universit...|$|E

These include crimes committed not only by individuals, but by <b>organised</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>groups,</b> corporations and governments. There are chapters on, for example, gang violence, hate crime, elder abuse, animal abuse,cyber crime, identity theft, money-laundering, eco crimes, drug trafficking, human trafficking, genocide, and global terrorism. Many of these topics receive surprisingly little attention in the criminological literature. The Handbook on Crime will be a unique text of lasting value to students, researchers,academics, practitioners, policy makers, journalists and all others involved in understanding and preventing criminal behaviour...|$|R
