40|$|The {{article focuses}} on the {{activity}} of French immigrants in Saint-Petersburg and Moscow in the 1 8 th century. After noticing the large amounts of people from Strasbourg living in Russia at that time, the author highlites their activity in both capitals of the Russian Empire. It seems that Strasbourg natives played major roles in education and in the arts in Russia {{at the end of}} the 1 8 th century. While some of them took an active part in the Russian literary life, others contributed by their writings to the development of knowledge about Russia in France. Many immigrants from Strasbourg worked in the field of education, <b>opening</b> <b>boarding</b> schools or working at the Cadet corps, the famous Saint-Petersburg military middle school. Immigrants from Strasbourg may also be found among artists, members of the French clergy abroad and even businessmen operating in both capitals. For instance it seems that the Moscow French book market may have been almost monopolized by booksellers from Strasbourg {{at the end of the}} 18 th century. Rjéoutski Vladislav.

2500|$|In late 1852, the Board of Education of the St. Louis Public Schools {{ordered the}} {{organization}} and opening {{of a high school}} to serve the city population. The Board located the school within Benton School, a primary school then located on 6th Street between St. Charles and Locust streets, and on February 7, 1853, 70 students were admitted after an entrance examination.

50|$|Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya Amroha (also {{known as}} JNV Amroha or JNV Baseda Taga) is a {{boarding}} school, {{set up in}} Amroha, India, in 2000. It is an autonomous body which works under the Department of Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development (India). The concept of <b>opening</b> a <b>boarding</b> school, called Navodaya Vidyalaya, in every district of India was born {{as a part of}} the section 5.15 in New Policy on Education (NPE86). Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya Amroha has a campus of 35 acres, close to Saidpur Mafi Bijnor on NH -76, in Baseda Taga, Amroha.

50|$|The land {{which the}} school stands now {{used to be}} a paddy field. It was donated by the locals to the school.

This caused the <b>opening</b> of a <b>boarding</b> school.|$|R

50|$|The National Junior College's {{boarding}} programme {{was launched}} in 2009 together with the <b>opening</b> of the <b>boarding</b> school. Under this programme, students stay in the boarding school for around one school term (10 weeks). Students also participate in the various activities planned during their stay. Such programmes include aesthetics programmes, leadership development programmes and night adventures. Since 2009, all Integrated Programme students from the college have participated in this programme.|$|R
50|$|The line {{opened to}} the public without {{ceremony}} on 2 July 1866. Following the <b>opening</b> the <b>Board</b> met to consider the next step of extending the line to Benson (at the time frequently referred to as Bensington), but it was obvious that money could not be raised to carry out any such work. Only £17,575 of the £80,000 capital for the line had ever been paid up, and the financial market was extremely difficult following the collapse of Overend, Gurney and Company. When it became known that a Bill was to be presented to Parliament for a line from Princes Risborough to Watlington, {{it was clear that the}} Wallingford and Watlington Railway was not going to build any more of their line.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} of the Goods Shed is substantially intact. The raised timber platform runs the full length, beside the internal siding.

To the southwest corner are partitions enclosing a small office.|$|R
25|$|However, the Institute's {{intentions}} were paternal and no democratic control by its students was intended. In 1829, radical Rowland Detrosier led a breakaway group {{to form the}} New Mechanics' Institution in Poole Street, a move that had a serious effect on the recruitment and finances of the original institute. Subscriptions and memberships in 1830–31 were an all-time low and only the gradual <b>opening</b> of the <b>board</b> up to election by the members rectified the situation. Detrosier's break-away ultimately rejoined the Institute.|$|R
50|$|Following the <b>opening</b> the <b>Board</b> met to {{consider}} the issue of extending the line to Benson (at the time frequently referred to as Bensington) as the statutory powers for land acquisition were to expire soon. The general economic conditions had deteriorated considerably, and the commercial bank Overend, Gurney and Company had failed in May 1866, deepening the crisis. Money became unobtainable {{and the question of}} extending the line was deferred: it was obvious that further subscriptions would not be forthcoming for some time. In fact only £17,575 of the £80,000 capital for the line had ever been paid up. The company's own revenue account was in serious difficulty, and sums due to the GWR in connection with the working arrangement were not being paid, and the contractor for the part of the line already built was also pressing for his money.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the west}} elevation, which faces Marine Parade, the {{decorative}} gable element features a loggia, consisting {{of an open}} porch with three round headed arches supported on two [...] "barley sugar" [...] twisted columns.

The edge of the stylised Baroque parapet has raised edge detailing which culminate in spiralled curves {{on the face of}} the gable. There are three doorways from the loggia, one of which has an overhead window <b>opening,</b> now <b>boarded.</b> The eastern elevation has a similar decorative parapeted gable housing six <b>boarded</b> window <b>openings.</b> The surrounds of these windows are round headed arched recesses. The skillion roofed wings on either side of the parapet element, previously fin walls forming entrances, are now infilled with weatherboard.|$|R
