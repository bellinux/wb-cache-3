From there through the coast of southwestern Florida, small craft were advised to remain near shore due to rough seas. <b>Offshore,</b> <b>workers</b> were removed from oil rigs.

5|$|A {{statement}} {{issued by the}} National Weather Service advised people in nine Florida counties to complete hurricane preparations, which included securing loose objects and moving watercraft to safety. Homes along the coast were boarded up by their owners, while <b>offshore,</b> <b>workers</b> were removed from oil platforms. A spokesman for Royal Dutch Shell reported that 800 workers were to be evacuated. In New Orleans, emergency equipment was readied and inspected. The New Orleans Levee Board went into a second-stage alert on September 21, and cleared debris from floodwall openings.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Oslo Airport {{location}} controversy, {{after the}} new airport was decided located to Gardermoen, there was a public discussion {{as to what to}} do with the general aviation which had operated from Fornebu. While some local aircraft owners wanted to keep a small part of Fornebu for general aviation, the authorities decided to close the airport completely. Instead, the general aviation was distributed to various private airports in Eastern Norway, including Notodden. In May 1998, Air Team started flights from Notodden to Bergen. Air Team gradually moved all its operations, including its pilot school, to Notodden. After Fornebu was closed in October, the airline experienced a quadrupling of patronage, as Gardermoen had given longer travel time for people in Buskerud and Telemark. In addition to business travel, the airline catered <b>offshore</b> <b>workers</b> commuting to the North Sea via Bergen. The airline stated that it intended to also open routes to Stavanger and Copenhagen.|$|E

The {{aircraft}} {{was en route}} from the MODU Sedco 709 offshore Nova Scotia to the Halifax International Airport(YHZ)when the main gearbox suffered a total loss of transmission fluid. There were 15 passengers and two crew on board. There were no injuries during the ditching, however several passengers suffered varying degrees of hypothermia.

25|$|Martin Ford, {{author of}} The Lights in the Tunnel: Automation, Accelerating Technology and the Economy of the Future, and {{others argue that}} {{specialized}} artificial intelligence applications, robotics {{and other forms of}} automation will ultimately result in significant unemployment as machines begin to match and exceed the capability of workers to perform most routine and repetitive jobs. Ford predicts that many knowledge-based occupations—and in particular entry level jobs—will be increasingly susceptible to automation via expert systems, machine learning and other AI-enhanced applications. AI-based applications may also be used to amplify the capabilities of low-wage <b>offshore</b> <b>workers,</b> making it more feasible to outsource knowledge work.|$|E

40|$|The {{offshore}} {{oil and gas}} industry operates a diverse range of shift work schedules, with uncertainty as to which are the most appropriate in terms of health and safety. Night-shift work causes desynchronisation of the work and sleep periods with the circadian rhythm (body clock). Such desynchrony leads to reduced alertness, fatigue, disturbances to sleep and to the normal metabolic response to meals consumed at night, and consequently may be detrimental to health and safety. Previously it has been demonstrated that <b>offshore</b> oil installation <b>workers</b> can adapt their circadian rhythm to a night shift schedule, by advancing or delaying the rhythm timing, depending on the schedule and conditions. Light is the major factor controlling the timing of the circadian system. Increased light at night improves alertness and performance and may possibly improve metabolic responses to meals during night shift conditions. It is of interest to the offshore industry to identify which commonly operated offshore shift schedules allow circadian adaptation and whether this confers any benefit with regard to fatigue, performance and metabolism. This project was undertaken by the University of Surrey for the Health and Safety Executive with the following aims• • To measure changes in circadian phase during different offshore shift schedules • To investigate the amount and timing of light exposure in <b>offshore</b> <b>worker...</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{preparation}} for the storm, 8,000 <b>offshore</b> oil <b>workers</b> were evacuated. Despite typical evacuation procedure, Chevron Corporation immediately evacuated their offshore oil staff rather than executing a three phase evacuation plan.

In New Orleans, 4,000 people checked into the city's 19 evacuation centers.

50|$|Domestic {{outsourcing}} {{can deliver}} cost savings of 50 percent on installing and managing software, compared to 15 to 30 percent cost savings from overseas offshoring.

In this sense, farmshoring offers {{a greater sense of}} control and security with the outsourced firm within U.S. borders. Onshore outsourcing also bypasses the language barrier associated with many <b>offshoring</b> arrangements. <b>Workers</b> in call centers in India for example, have to learn to speak English the “American” way to enter into outsourcing contracts with U.S. firms.|$|R

The model is estimated through Quasi-Maximum Likelihood {{to account for the}} presence of corner solutions. Results suggest that concerns about service offshoring are ill-founded: service offshoring stimulates labor demand for the white-collar and changes its skill distribution in favor of high-skilled occupations.

We use Finnish worker-firm data merged with product-level trade data. We focus on Chinese imports and instrument them by changes in China's share of world exports to other EU countries. Both types of importing increase the job loss risk for all workers and, in particular, for workers in production occupations. An increase in import competition has larger negative effects than an increase in <b>offshoring.</b> Production <b>workers</b> suffer the largest earnings losses, while for high- skilled workers the wage-effect is positive...|$|R
