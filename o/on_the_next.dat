5|$|A {{week after}} being upset by LSU, Alabama {{returned}} to Bryant–Denny {{and began a}} three-game homestand to end the season by defeating long-time rival Mississippi State 30–10. The Crimson Tide took a 6–3 lead {{in the first quarter}} by trading field goals with the Bulldogs on a 36-yarder from Jeremy Shelley, a 24-yarder from Derek DePasquale and a 45-yarder from Cade Foster. In the second, Alabama reached the end zone {{for the first time on}} the evening after Greg McElroy hit Marquis Maze for a 45-yard touchdown reception and a 13–3 lead. After a punt <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> Bulldog series, an 80-yard Maze touchdown return was called back as a result of an illegal block on the play by Alex Watkins. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> play, Mark Ingram took a short bubble screen pass from McElroy 78-yards for a 20–3 lead at the half.|$|E
5|$|After a 39-yard {{field goal}} by Leigh Tiffin {{extended}} {{the lead to}} 17–0 in the third, the Bulldogs scored their only points of the night on a 34-yard Derek DePasquale field goal. On the ensuing kickoff, Javier Arenas returned the ball 46 yards and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> play, McElroy hit Julio Jones for a 48-yard touchdown reception. The score was 24–3. Mark Barron intercepted a Tyson Lee pass at the Alabama 30 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> Bulldog offensive series. On the following play, Ingram scored a touchdown on a 70-yard run to bring the final score to 31–3.|$|E

5|$|After a two-yard Jefferson run to {{open the}} fourth quarter, Alleman kicked a 30-yard field goal {{to tie the game}} at 6–6. Alabama began the next series with a two-yard Richardson {{reception}} followed by a two-yard run before McCarron connected with Maze for a first down on an 18-yard reception. Richardson then had a three-yard run and a 24-yard run to give the Crimson Tide a first down at the LSU 28. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> play, Maze threw an interception on a trick play to Reid at the LSU one-yard line to give the Tigers possession. After Alabama held LSU to a three-and-out, Wing had a 73-yard punt to give Alabama possession at their own 18. Alabama and LSU then traded punts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> three offensive possessions to send the game into overtime tied 6–6.|$|E
5|$|After the post-score kickoff and return, Florida State {{began at}} its 22-yard line. Weinke {{completed}} a first-down pass to Warrick, but Warrick committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty in the process. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> play, Weinke attempted a long pass downfield, but Tech defender Anthony Midget intercepted {{the ball at}} the Tech 41-yard line. Trailing by five, Tech's offense began a drive to potentially further cut Florida State's lead or put the Hokies in the lead themselves. After slipping {{on the field and}} taking a loss, Vick completed a 20-yard pass to Hawkins, who picked up a first down and pushed Tech to the Florida State 39-yard line. After a short rush by Kendrick, Vick scrambled to the State 21-yard line for another first down. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> play, Vick was sacked for a seven-yard loss, but recovered the lost ground by running for 22yards <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> play. With a first down at the Seminoles' seven-yard line, Vick handed the ball to Kendrick, who ran seven yards straight ahead for a Tech touchdown, giving the Hokies the lead {{for the first time in}} the game. Again, Beamer ordered a two-point conversion attempt, but again, Florida State stopped the Hokies short. Despite that failure to pick up the two-point conversion, Tech took a 2928 lead with 2:13 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|Connecticut fumbled {{the ball}} for the sixth time <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> possession; this time Donald Brown was {{responsible}} for dropping the ball. Buffalo recovered for the fifth time, {{but was unable to}} score, punting to ball back to UConn with 4:37 left in the half. Brown made up for his earlier mistake by breaking off a 75-yard run before being caught from behind. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> play Tyler Lorenzen ran the ball into the end zone from 13yards out. Neither team scored {{for the remainder of the}} first half, making the score 20–17 Buffalo going into halftime.|$|E

5|$|Despite being pinned {{against their}} own goal line, the Hokies {{initially}} had some success moving the ball. Taylor completed a two-yard pass, Evans ran for six yards, and Taylor ran for two yards on third down to earn a first down at the Tech 13-yard line. After a Tech timeout, Darren Evans ran for five yards. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> play, he broke free for a 32-yard run, advancing {{the ball to the}} 50-yard line. The Hokies were unable to capitalize on Evans' run, however, as <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> play, a pass from Taylor was intercepted by Cincinnati defender Brandon Underwood at the Cincinnati 28-yard line.|$|E
5|$|Entering the Democratic nominating convention, Brown {{seemed to}} be the {{favorite}} for the nomination. On the first ballot, he garnered the most votes (275), leading Clay (264), Clardy (190), and Hardin (186). Over the next nine ballots, the vote counts changed little. Finally, the convention chairman announced that the candidate receiving the fewest votes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> ballot would be dropped from the voting. Clardy received the fewest votes, and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> ballot, his supporters divided almost equally between the remaining three candidates. Hardin was the next candidate to be dropped, and Brown received a majority over Clay on the thirteenth ballot.|$|E
5|$|From the Tech 20-yard line, Druckenmiller {{completed}} a 13-yard pass to Still {{for a first}} down at the Tech 33-yard line. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> play, Druckenmiller {{completed a}} long pass to tight end Bryan Jennings, who carried the ball 41 yards. Following the play, the Volunteers completed a penalty, advancing {{the ball to the}} Tennessee 22-yard line. Two short runs advanced the Hokies to the 19-yard line, then Druckenmiller completed a 10-yard pass to Freeman for a first down. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> play, Druckenmiller connected with Still for a nine-yard touchdown pass. The extra point was good, and Tennessee's lead was cut to 4523, but with only 4:13 remaining in the game, the game seemed out of reach for the Hokies.|$|E

5|$|In {{the home}} opener for the 2012 season, Alabama {{shut out the}} Hilltoppers of Western Kentucky University (WKU) 35–0. To open the game, Alabama scored on a 14-yard AJ McCarron {{touchdown}} pass to Christion Jones that capped a four-play, 72-yard drive. On the WKU drive that ensued, Nico Johnson forced a Marquis Sumler fumble that was recovered by Damion Square at the WKU 49-yard line. However, the Crimson Tide was unable {{to capitalize on the}} turnover after McCarron was sacked twice and were forced to punt. The defense responded <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> drive with their second recovered fumble of the game. This time, Adrian Hubbard caused the Antonio Andrews fumble that was recovered by Brandon Ivory at the WKU 33-yard line. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> play, McCarron threw a 33-yard touchdown pass to Kevin Norwood for a 14–0 Crimson Tide lead.|$|E
5|$|Navy {{began the}} third quarter with a 9-play, 60-yard {{touchdown}} drive composed completely of runs. This gave them their first lead of the game at 51–49 (the extra point attempt was blocked). <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> North Texas drive, Midshipmen outside linebacker Ram Vela intercepted Giovanni Vizza's pass at the Midshipmen 20-yard line. Three plays later, Navy running back Zerbin Singleton ran 65 yards for another touchdown, making the score 58–49. The Mean Green responded with a 7-play, 59-yard drive, which ended with another Vizza touchdown pass to Casey Fitzgerald. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> play from scrimmage, Kettani ran 49 yards.

Once again, the Sooners stalled {{in the red}} zone and were again forced {{to settle for a}} field goal, this time a 24-yarder by Michael Hunnicutt. The next two drives by Texas A and Oklahoma both ended in interceptions thrown by Manziel and Jones respectively. Texas A took over at the Oklahoma 48 yardline {{following}} Jones' interception. A trick play to start the drive resulted in senior wide receiver Kenric McNeal throwing a 20-yard pass to Mike Evans. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> play, running back Ben Malena running the ball 23 yards to the five yardline.
