5|$|Amargasaurus was quadrupedal (moved on four legs), and {{probably}} {{was unable to}} rear on its hind legs. Salgado and Bonaparte (1991) suggested that Amargasaurus was a slow walker, as both the forearms and lower legs were proportionally short, as a feature common to slow-moving animals. This was contradicted by Gerardo Mazzetta and Richard Fariña (1999), who argued that Amargasaurus was capable <b>of</b> <b>rapid</b> locomotion. During locomotion, leg bones are strongly affected by bending moments, representing a limiting factor for the maximum speed of an animal. The leg bones of Amargasaurus were even more sturdy than those of today's white rhinoceros, which is adapted to galloping.|$|E
5|$|As Danielle tracked westward {{into the}} open Atlantic early on August14, the storm {{encountered}} warmer water southwest of Cape Verde and began to gradually intensify, becoming a moderate tropical storm with 50mph (85km/h) winds that morning.

Over a 24‑hour period ending {{in the morning of}} August15, the pressure fell from 1004 to 978mbar and the winds increased to 90mph (145km/h), making it a high-end Category1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale.|$|E

50|$|During {{their journey}} down the river, Charlie, Rose and the African Queen {{encounter}} many obstacles, including the German fort and three sets <b>of</b> <b>rapids.</b> The first set <b>of</b> <b>rapids</b> is rather easy; they get through with minimal flooding in the boat. But when {{they pass the}} fortress and the soldiers begin shooting at them, the bullets pierce {{the top of the}} boiler and cause one of the steam pressure hoses to disconnect from the boiler. This causes the boat's engine to stop. Luckily, Charlie manages to reattach the hose to the boiler just as they are about to enter the second set <b>of</b> <b>rapids.</b> The boat rolls and pitches crazily as it goes down the rapids, leading to more severe flooding in the boat. However, they make it through.|$|R

5|$|As the TUTT {{gradually}} warmed, Gordon {{was able}} to undergo a prolonged period <b>of</b> <b>rapid</b> intensification, despite having restricted outflow. Over a 30-hour period from July14 to 15, the storm's central pressure decreased by 70mbar (hPa; 2.07inHg), just below the threshold for explosive intensification.

Around the same time, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) assessed the storm to have attained 10-minute sustained winds of 185km/h (115mph) along with a minimum pressure of 915mbar (hPa; 27.02inHg).|$|E

5|$|During {{the threat}} display, any sudden {{movement}} by the intruder may provoke the mamba {{into a series}} <b>of</b> <b>rapid</b> strikes leading to severe envenomation.

This behaviour also permits the snake to land a strike at unexpectedly long range. The black mamba's reputed readiness to attack is often much exaggerated and usually is provoked by perceived threats, such as blocking its intended retreat, accidentally or otherwise.|$|E
