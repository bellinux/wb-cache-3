Although {{at the time}} it was available legally over the internet, only 10% of users reported purchasing it online, with most purchasing it from street dealers. Of those who had used mephedrone, 97% said it was easy or very easy to obtain. Around 50% of users reported at least one negative effect associated with the use of mephedrone, of which teeth grinding is the most common. Detailed interviews with users in Northern Ireland similarly found that few purchased mephedrone online, with most interviewees citing concerns that their address would be traced or that family members could intercept the package.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1984 the New Order {{government}} used Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI as {{a propaganda}} vehicle, showing it annually on 30 September. The film was broadcast by the state-owned network TVRI, {{and later on}} private television stations after they were established. It was also shown at schools and government institutions; students would be taken to open fields to view the film in a group. Because of this use, Sen and Hill suggest that Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI is the most-broadcast and most-watched Indonesian film of all time. A 2000 survey by the Indonesian magazine Tempo found 97percent of the 1,101 students surveyed had seen the film; 87percent <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> seen it more than once.|$|E
