25|$|As already mentioned, Vance and Frawley {{were offered}} {{a chance to}} take their {{characters}} to their own spin-off series. Frawley was willing, but Vance refused to ever work with Frawley again since the two did not get along. Frawley did appear once more with Lucille Ball — in an episode of The Lucy Show in 1965, which did not include Vance (who by then had ceased to be a regular <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>show).</b> However, this was his last screen appearance with his longtime friend.

25|$|On May 13, 2006, Sapp was to {{headline}} the K-1 {{show in the}} Netherlands against Ernesto Hoost, in which Hoost had stated in previous interviews and the interview <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>show</b> that {{it was to be}} his last match in the Netherlands before his retirement. Sapp attended all the pre-fight press conferences and even attended the opening ceremonies for the show. It is unclear at the moment as to why, but Sapp pulled out of the event midway through the show. K-1 issued a statement claiming Sapp pulled out due to new demands he brought to promoters during the show. K-1 would not agree to those demands since they felt their written contract was final and Sapp left. The full K-1 press release can be viewed on the organization's website. Sapp has not issued a statement, but some sources indicated that he disagreed with K-1's account of events.|$|E

In a CNN interview about the show, he told Larry King [...] "no one has the ability, that I'm aware of, to do anything supernatural, psychic, talk to the dead. And that was what I said I {{was going to do}} with Phenomenon. If somebody goes <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>show</b> and claims to have supernatural psychic ability, I'm going to bust [...] live and on television." ...|$|E

500|$|Following actor Charlie Sheen's {{departure}} from the CBS comedy series Two and a Half Men in March 2011, rumors began to circulate that Rob Lowe might leave Parks and Recreation to take Sheen's place <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>show.</b> People magazine reported that Two and a Half Men creator Chuck Lorre was [...] "seriously discussing the possibility" [...] of signing Lowe, and Sheen himself {{said he would be}} a [...] "fabulous" [...] successor. Those rumors proved unfounded, however, and were flatly denied by Michael Schur, who called it [...] "complete gibberish". Although widely considered a supporting role, Lowe's performance as Chris Traeger was submitted for a 2011 Primetime Emmy Award in the Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series category.|$|E
500|$|Carey Wilber {{was hired}} to write a script for an episode of Star Trek. His idea {{was based on an}} episode he wrote for the {{television}} series Captain Video and His Video Rangers (1949–1955). His work <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>show</b> featured Ancient-Greek-era humans transported in suspended animation through space, with the people of the future finding that they have mythological powers. For [...] "Space Seed", Wilber replaced these mythological powers with abilities that were enhanced due to genetic engineering. Wilber had briefly worked with Gene Roddenberry on the television series Harbormaster. His science fiction extended beyond Star Trek: he also wrote scripts for Lost in Space and The Time Tunnel around the same time.|$|E
500|$|Robert Bathurst, {{a former}} Footlights president, was cast as Mark Taylor. He was {{performing}} on a live topical programme on BSB called Up Yer News. A fellow performer <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>show</b> also auditioned {{for the part}} at {{what is now the}} Soho Theatre, then the old Soho Synagogue in Dean Street, and claimed that he would break Bathurst's legs if the latter got the job. In a 2005 interview, Bathurst recalls that the threat seemed not to be entirely jocular. Bathurst speaks very highly of Joking Apart, identifying it as a [...] "career highlight" [...] and the most enjoyable job he has ever done. Retrospectively, he wishes that he had [...] "roughened up" [...] Mark, as he was [...] "too designery".|$|E

500|$|Another {{cultural}} reference {{appears in}} one of Wayne's flashbacks, {{in which he is}} seen receiving special training against enemies such as Chucky of the Child's Play film series and basketball player Kobe Bryant. The Taiwanese dramatization of Wayne's fight with Snake at Moe's Tavern parodies the humorous computer animated re-enactments of news stories done by the Taiwan-based Next Media Animation. One YouTube clip that Viktor sees is a reference to The Gregory Brothers, the creators of the popular online Auto-Tune the News series, in that a news segment featuring a lady who has lost her cat has been autotuned into a song. Marge's dream of becoming a contestant in a cooking competition parodies the American reality competition series Top Chef. American chef Tom Colicchio, who is a judge <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>show,</b> guest starred in [...] "The Falcon and the D'ohman" [...] as himself.|$|E
500|$|... "I {{could stay}} forever {{on the show}} and be safe. But three years ago I did Night of the Iguana in Williamstown , and I had a quote from Tennessee Williams taped on my mirror, taken from an essay he'd written on success. It said, and I'm paraphrasing here: 'Security is {{in the shape of a}} {{kidney-shaped}} pool in Los Angeles, where you sit waiting for your residual checks.' I was in a comfortable spot on Knots, and an artist should not be comfortable. I'd forgotten that there was a character I'd loved for 13 years. She was the seed of the show. I am the sole person to spin off from Dallas (because actor David Ackroyd originated the role of Gary <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>show).</b> Valene gave Knots a note of spirituality. There was a heart that was Valene. I hope they treat her with respect, that she is seen out with a resolution she deserves." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2008 the {{progressive}} pressure group Media Matters for America picketed {{the studios of}} WOR in New York, along with parents of autistic children.

Later that evening, Savage devoted his entire three-hour program to the subject, taking calls from parents who took issue with his comments. <b>On</b> <b>that</b> <b>show</b> Savage stated that his remarks had been [...] "ripped out of context" [...] by [...] "far left Stalinists" [...] who want him off of the air. He appeared on Larry King Live with Glenn Beck as the substitute host for Larry King, {{and said that the}} real issue he was commenting on was the overdiagnosis of children due to pharmaceutical companies' drive to drug children for higher profits.|$|E
