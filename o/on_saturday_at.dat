Gray, {{made the first}} ever trans-Atlantic passenger flight. The first leg of the flight, Baltimore to Horta, took 17 hours and 32 minutes and covered 2,400 miles. The second leg from Horta to Pan Am's newly-built airport in Lisbon took 7 hours and 7 minutes and covered 1,200 miles.

Eastbound flights left <b>on</b> <b>Saturday</b> <b>at</b> 7:30 am and arrived at Southampton on Sunday at 1 pm GCT.
