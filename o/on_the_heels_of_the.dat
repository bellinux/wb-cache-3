5|$|Late at night, the Royalist generals reached York, {{with many}} routed troops and stragglers. The Governor of York, Sir Thomas Glemham, allowed {{only those who}} were part of the {{garrison}} (in effect, only a few officers who had participated in the battle as volunteers) into the city, in case Parliamentarian cavalry entered the city <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>heels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fleeing Royalists. Many fugitives, including wounded, crowded the streets before Micklegate Bar, the western gate into the city.|$|E
5|$|Biotechnology in {{the modern}} sense of genetic {{engineering}} began in the 1970s, with the invention of recombinant DNA techniques. Restriction enzymes were discovered and characterized in the late 1960s, following <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>heels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> isolation, then duplication, then synthesis of viral genes. Beginning with the lab of Paul Berg in 1972 (aided by EcoRI from Herbert Boyer's lab, building on work with ligase by Arthur Kornberg's lab), molecular biologists put these pieces together to produce the first transgenic organisms. Soon after, others began using plasmid vectors and adding genes for antibiotic resistance, greatly increasing {{the reach of the}} recombinant techniques.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the hurricane in coastal Florida, it became apparent that well-constructed buildings with shutters had suffered practically no damage from winds that caused serious structural problems to lesser buildings. Buildings with well-constructed frames, and those made of steel, concrete, brick, or stone were largely immune to the winds, and the use of shutters prevented damage to windows and the interior of the buildings. Coming <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>heels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1926 Miami hurricane where a similar pattern had been noticed, one lasting result of the 1928 storm was improved building codes.|$|E

5|$|Alsos {{interviewed the}} Italian Minister for Communications, the Chief of Naval Ordnance, {{the staff of}} the Italian Naval Academy, and Italian {{scientists}} at the University of Naples, and examined what captured technical documents could be found. There was little information about developments in northern Italy and Germany. The Alsos Mission was attached to Colonel George Smith's S-Force. Built around a Royal Air Force ground reconnaissance squadron equipped with armored cars, this unit contained American, British, French, and Italian technical specialists of various kinds who would enter Rome <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>heels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> advancing Allied forces. The expectation that Rome would soon be captured proved premature, and by March 1944 most of the Alsos Mission had returned to the United States. The Alsos Mission had gathered little of value about nuclear matters, but submitted detailed reports about German rockets and guided missiles.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} days of August 1995, NATO {{launched}} Operation Deliberate Force—an air campaign targeting the VRS. This campaign was launched in response to the second Markale massacre of 28 August, which came <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>heels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Srebrenica massacre. Airstrikes began on 30 August, initially targeting VRS air defences, and striking targets near Sarajevo. The campaign was briefly suspended on 1 September and its scope was expanded to target artillery and storage facilities around the city. The bombing resumed on 5 September, and its scope extended to VRS air defences near Banja Luka by 9 September as NATO had nearly exhausted its list of targets near Sarajevo. On 13 September, the Bosnian Serbs accepted NATO's demand for the establishment of an exclusion zone around Sarajevo and the campaign ceased.|$|E

Misfits was rejected in December 2000 and The Second Coming was initially approved by Channel 4 but later rejected after a change of executive personnel. Instead of contesting the cancellation of The Second Coming, he left Channel 4 and vowed to not work with them again.|$|E

5|$|The {{years that}} {{followed}} witnessed cordial relations between Mysore and the British until things began to sour in the 1820s. Even though the Governor of Madras, Thomas Munro, determined after a personal investigation in 1825 {{that there was no}} substance to the allegations of financial impropriety made by A. H. Cole, the incumbent Resident of Mysore, the Nagar rebellion (a civil insurrection) which broke out {{towards the end of the}} decade changed things considerably. In 1831, close <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>heels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> insurrection and citing mal-administration, the British took direct control of the princely state. For the next fifty years, Mysore passed under the rule of successive British Commissioners; Sir Mark Cubbon, renowned for his statesmanship, served from 1834 until 1861 and put into place an efficient and successful administrative system which left Mysore a well-developed state.|$|E
