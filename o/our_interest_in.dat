500|$|Several critics {{regard the}} 1991 {{animated}} film as {{superior to the}} 2017 live-action remake. Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune said that the 1991 film [...] "worked wonderfully because it was pure Broadway, written for the screen, blending comedy and romance and magic and just enough snark in the margins", while the 2017 remake got lost in translation since [...] "The movie takes our knowledge and <b>our</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the material for granted. It zips from one number to another, throwing a ton of frenetically edited eye candy at the screen, charmlessly." [...] Phillips also wrote of the 2017 film that [...] "too often we're watching highly qualified performers, plus a few less conspicuously talented ones (Watson, primarily), stuck doing karaoke, or motion-capture work of middling quality". Dana Schwartz of the Observer criticized some of the 2017 film changes to the characters like Gaston and the Beast as regressive by watering down their distinguishing personalities from the 1991 film, also arguing that the added backstory to {{the characters in the}} 2017 version failed to [...] "advance the plot or theme in any meaningful way". David Sims of The Atlantic wrote that the 2017 film [...] "feels particularly egregious, in part, because it’s so slavishly devoted to the original; every time it falls short of its predecessor (which is quite often), it’s hard not to notice".|$|E

The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports an 82% [...] "Certified Fresh" [...] approval rating, {{with an average}} rating of 6.9 out of 10 (based on 56 reviews). According to the website consensus, [...] "Obvious copycatting aside, Quantico provides ludicrously entertaining thrills from a well-balanced cast." [...] The series has a score of 70 out of 100 (based on 25 reviews) on Metacritic, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". The Newark Star-Ledgers Vicki Hyman called Quantico the best new show {{of the season and}} graded it an [...] "A". Hyman wrote that the show was [...] "taut and terrifically calibrated ... with at least one deadly effective twist you won't see coming." [...] Wiegand, David from San Francisco Chronicle also praised the series: [...] "The plot is intricate and compelling, the characters magnetic and mysterious at the same time." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today rated Quantico three out of four, calling its cast [...] "an appropriately diverse group, brought to life by generally fine performances, led by Chopra's and Ellis": [...] "There are times when Quantico feels a shade mechanical, in moments when you can practically hear the plot gears moving. But it accomplishes what the opener of a whodunit needs to do: establish a wide range of plausible suspects and spark <b>our</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the mystery and the hero." ...|$|E

500|$|Pauline Kael {{said it was}} [...] "a monumentally unimaginative movie", and Stanley Kauffmann of The New Republic {{called it}} [...] "a film that is so dull, it even dulls <b>our</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the {{technical}} ingenuity {{for the sake of}} which Kubrick has allowed it to become dull." [...] Renata Adler of The New York Times wrote that it was [...] "somewhere between hypnotic and immensely boring." [...] Variety's 'Robe' believed the film was a [...] "ig, beautiful, but plodding sci-fi epic... A major achievement in cinematography and special effects, 2001 lacks dramatic appeal to a large degree and only conveys suspense after the halfway mark." [...] Andrew Sarris called it [...] "one of the grimmest films I have ever seen in my life...2001 is a disaster because it is much too abstract to make its abstract points." [...] (Sarris reversed his opinion upon a second viewing of the film, and declared, [...] "2001 is indeed a major work by a major artist.") John Simon felt it was [...] "a regrettable failure, although not a total one. This film is fascinating when it concentrates on apes or machines... and dreadful when it deals with the in-betweens: humans...2001, for all its lively visual and mechanical spectacle, is a kind of space-Spartacus and, more pretentious still, a shaggy God story." [...] Eminent historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. deemed the film [...] "morally pretentious, intellectually obscure and inordinately long... a film out of control". The BBC said that its slow pacing often alienates modern audiences more than it did upon its initial release.|$|E
500|$|Brothers Glenn and Todd Kessler {{decided to}} work with Daniel Zelman because [...] "we have a third brother, but Daniel {{is kind of like}} our fourth brother that we've known for over 20 years." [...] When the Kesslers and Zelman devised the series, they did not {{specifically}} intend for Patty and Ellen to be lawyers. They wanted to explore the power structures in two strong women—feeling that the male power dynamics had been seen before—and considered a number of professions, including entertainment and pharmaceuticals, before deciding on law. Zelman said that the writers' main motivation to write about the law [...] "was <b>our</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> power dynamics, the dynamics of power in society. We're very much interested in the ambiguity of it. We're just interested in seeing how far we can push these characters." [...] According to Kessler, [...] "One thing that's crucial is that Patty Hewes is {{on one end of the}} spectrum and Ellen Parsons is on the other." [...] The relationship the writers were most interested in showing was that between a mentor and a mentee, which is represented by Patty and her protégée Ellen. Todd Kessler called the real life Enron case [...] "a big part" [...] of the inspiration for Patty's main case involving Arthur Frobisher, though Zelman claims that Enron was not used as a basis in particular: [...] "It was more just the culture of all those corporate scandals at the time. There seemed to be one after the other of them, and we became very interested in sort of the characters who were a part of those scandals." ...|$|E

The San Francisco Chronicle praised the series, calling it a winner and wrote: [...] "The plot is intricate and compelling, the characters magnetic and mysterious at the same time." [...] James Poniewozik of The New York Times wrote about Chopra's performance, describing her as the [...] "strongest human asset" [...] of the show, and added that [...] "she is immediately charismatic and commanding". He added that [...] "the narrative gymnastics make the first half-hour of Quantico pass quickly and entertainingly. Too much of this, though, keeps you from investing much in the characters." [...] Robert Bianco from USA Today gave it a three out of four, praising the diversity of the cast and Chopra's and Ellis performances, writing [...] "There are times when Quantico feels a shade mechanical, in moments when you can practically hear the plot gears moving. But it accomplishes what the opener of a whodunit needs to do: establish a wide range of plausible suspects and spark <b>our</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the mystery and the hero." [...] In contrast, TheWraps Tim Grierson, who although felt that the show [...] "provides sexy fun", was less impressed, writing that the show often succumbed to [...] "lame-brained plotting" [...] and a unconvincing portrayal of the setting. He concluded saying that the fluffy material did not fit well with the darker tones [...] "meant to be struck by the introduction of a cataclysmic terrorist attack." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Population Bomb {{was written}} at the {{suggestion}} of David Brower {{the executive director of the}} environmentalist Sierra Club, and Ian Ballantine of Ballantine Books following various public appearances Ehrlich had made regarding population issues and their relation to the environment. Although the Ehrlichs collaborated on the book, the publisher insisted that a single author be credited, and also asked to change their preferred title: Population, Resources, and Environment. The title Population Bomb was taken (with permission) from General William H. Draper, founder of the Population Crisis Committee and a pamphlet issued in 1954 by the Hugh Moore Fund. The Ehrlichs regret the choice of title, which they admit was a perfect choice from a marketing perspective, but think that [...] "it led Paul to be miscategorized as solely focused on human numbers, despite <b>our</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> all the factors affecting the human trajectory." ...|$|E
2500|$|During late-September, President Kennedy {{dispatched}} the McNamara Taylor {{mission to}} investigate the political and military situation in South Vietnam.
