2500|$|During {{his job as}} an {{employment}} agent, Ian witnesses a seizure suffered by Corinne Lewis (Nicola Harrison). Unsatisfied with the brief mention Joy Division receives from television host Tony Wilson (Craig Parkinson), Ian demands that he put the band <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>programme.</b> In April 1978 Joy Division plays a battle of bands, impressing Tony and Rob Gretton (Toby Kebbell), who becomes their new manager.

2500|$|Ramsay {{has been}} criticised for his {{frequent}} use of strong language <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>programmes,</b> first by British celebrity cook Delia Smith, then, in relation to Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares, {{by a member of}} the Federal Parliament of Australia. In his autobiography, Ramsay himself said he was unaware of the extent of his swearing until he watched an episode of Boiling Point.

2500|$|In the {{following}} year Hamilton was studying piano at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music, where he met Kim Moyes (studying classical percussion). Hamilton on keyboards and Moyes on vibraphone joined an electronic band Prop, with Jeremy Barnett on marimbas, David Symes on bass guitar and Jared Underwood on drums. Prop released their debut album, Small Craft Rough Sea, in 2001 on [...] Undercover Music/Silent Recordings label. In October that year, Radio National's Brent Clough aired some of their tracks <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>programme,</b> Otherworlds, and described their sound as [...] "fusing jazz, classical, minimalist, funk and techno elements into a seamless whole" [...] and noted their [...] "remarkably diverse influences – with selections from Olivier Messiaen and Philip Glass to Sci-Fi soundtracks, Squarepusher and Al Green".|$|E
60|$|Well may the Walrus, most discerning and eclectic of beasts, place sealing-wax midway <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>programme</b> {{of topics}} that fall {{pertinent}} and diverting upon the ear.|$|E
60|$|But {{you never}} know. Call no evening dull till it is over. However uninteresting {{its early stages}} may have been that night was to be as {{animated}} and exciting as any audience could desire--a night to be looked back to and talked about, for just as the critic of London Gossip wrote those damning words <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>programme,</b> guiding his pencil uncertainly in the dark, a curious yet familiar odour stole over the house.|$|E
50|$|Schmickler {{works as}} a comedian in Germany on TV-shows, in radio and <b>on</b> theatre stages. <b>His</b> <b>programme</b> consist of {{political}} cabaret.|$|R

6000|$|Then {{he begged}} {{her to give}} him a dance, and, as a great favor, she allowed him the fifth waltz. Luckily it stood vacant <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>programme.</b> They danced it together, and there was a little flutter round the room. Bremmil had a sort of notion that his wife could dance, but he never knew she danced so divinely. At the end of that waltz he asked for another--as a favor, not as a right; and Mrs. Bremmil said: [...] "Show me your programme, dear!" [...] He showed it as a naughty little schoolboy hands up {{contraband}} sweets to a master.|$|E

Mrs. Bremmil said nothing, but she smiled contemptuously, ran her pencil through 7 and 9--two [...] "H's"--and returned the card with her own name written above--a pet name that only she and her husband used. Then she shook her finger at him, and said, laughing: [...] "Oh, you silly, SILLY boy!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Puzzling {{over this}} problem, Jill missed {{much of the}} {{beginning}} of the second act. Hers was a detachment which the rest of the audience would gladly have shared. For the poetic drama, after a bad start, was now plunging into worse depths of dullness. The coughing had become almost continuous. The stalls, supported by the presence of large droves of Sir Chester's personal friends, were struggling gallantly to maintain a semblance of interest, but the pit and gallery had plainly given up hope. The critic of a weekly paper of small circulation, who had been shoved up in the upper circle, grimly jotted down the phrase [...] "apathetically received" [...] <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>programme.</b> He had come to the theatre that night in an aggrieved mood, for managers usually put him in the dress-circle. He got out his pencil again. Another phrase had occurred to him, admirable for the opening of his article. [...] "At the Leicester Theatre," [...] he wrote, [...] "where Sir Chester Portwood presented 'Tried by Fire,' dullness reigned supreme...." ...|$|E
50|$|Despite being {{broadcast}} in an overnight timeslot, Lester prided himself <b>on</b> calling <b>his</b> <b>programme</b> The Best Time of the Day.

50|$|In October 2006, UKIP {{announced}} that talkSPORT presenter James Whale might stand against Ken Livingstone in the 2008 election.

He was invited by Clarence to write on a 1970s Lotus LP sleeve. Vernon Corea wrote: [...] "We have all shared the treat of your lovely Lyrics, your tuneful compositions, your friendly presentation and your spontaneous sense of sharing with your followers, your treasury of talent. Keep going, keep growing, keep glowing".|$|R

5000|$|It {{is a more}} {{permissive}} era, {{and life}} has become dull and boring for the world at large. Since everything is now permitted, nothing is exciting, and even the popular violent spectator sport of [...] "rollerball" [...] is treated as passé. Jimmy Hill, {{who is now a}} very old man with a long beard, greets sports <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>programme</b> with the same level of boredom {{as the rest of the}} population.|$|E

50|$|Hanvey {{has been}} hosting his popular programme, The Ramblin' Man on Downtown Radio, {{since the late}} 1970s. Guests <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>programme</b> have {{included}} Ulster Volunteer Force leader Gusty Spence, Provisional Irish Republican Army veteran Joe Cahill, the last four Chief Constables of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and its successor organization, the Police Service of Northern Ireland - John Hermon, Hugh Annesley, Ronnie Flanagan, and Hugh Orde.

5000|$|We visited countless villages, and {{everywhere}} {{it was the}} same thing. Huge crowds surged forward, blocking the streets, while Menon was drowned by the surrounding uproar, his umbrella knocked away by the ceaseless bombardment of flowers and bouquets.

5000|$|Her {{reworking}} of English words was {{a distinctive}} {{element of the}} show.

[...] "SWs" [...] was shorthand for [...] "Love the show" [...] (as in the oft-quoted phrase by Steve Wright <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>programmes,</b> hence {{the use of his}} initials). Many listeners wrote in to ask what [...] "SWs" [...] actually meant, but she rarely explained it. Kennedy was also said to have been the first person to use the term 'white van man' in 1997.|$|R
50|$|Simon Bates {{revived the}} Golden Hour for {{commercial}} radio after joining Smooth Radio in January 2011.

There were usually two featured years per day, but this changed to one from October 2013. On Friday 21 March 2014, Bates presented his final show for Smooth, and announced that he was featuring the last ever Golden Hour <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>programme.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1997 Penk {{moved on}} to work at Capital Radio London {{presenting}} the mid-morning show. <b>On</b> <b>his</b> <b>programme</b> he regularly did his famous radio wind-ups. It was during one of these [...] "wind-up" [...] calls that Penk had the idea to call the then British Prime Minister, Tony Blair. He {{was able to get}} through the No.10 switchboard and managed to get Blair on the air for a few minutes. Blair later mentioned during Prime Minister's Questions that Penk had prank-called him that morning, and at that point it became a global media story.|$|E
5000|$|In August 1979, a {{year after}} the band broke up, [...] "Julia's Song" [...] was {{included}} on a compilation record of local bands called Street to Street: A Liverpool Album (Open Eye Records / OE LP 501).

5000|$|In 1966, her children's song [...] "Les Leçons particulières" [...] ("Private lessons") was {{the subject}} of public notoriety and displeasure; the same {{occurred}} when Jean-Christophe Averty choreographed a troupe of men on all fours to illustrate another of her children's songs, [...] "J'ai retrouvé mon chien" [...] ("I've found my dog"), <b>on</b> <b>his</b> television <b>programme,</b> Les Raisins verts.|$|R
