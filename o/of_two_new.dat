5|$|Armstrong {{was born}} in what would soon become the {{province}} of Ontario in 1867. After briefly teaching school, he entered the business industry, as a druggist. After initially gaining experience in politics on the council of Eastnor Township, he relocated west {{to the city of}} Edmonton, Alberta. In Edmonton, he established his pharmaceutical business once again and worked briefly with his brother on real estate and construction projects. In 1907, he ran for election to the Edmonton City Council and was elected to a two-year term. In 1910, he decided to run for the mayoralty in the municipal election; uncontested as the only nominated candidate on election day, Armstrong was acclaimed to the mayor's chair for the upcoming year. During his term, several issues were brought up to attention, including the city's need of a new civic building and the possibility <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>new</b> gas plants for the city.|$|E
5|$|By a {{decision}} of the European Council at Edinburgh in December 1992, the Council has its seat in Brussels but in April, June, and October, it holds its meetings in Luxembourg. Between 1952 and 1967 the ECSC Council held its Luxembourg meetings in the Cercle Municipal on Place d’Armes. Its secretariat moved on numerous occasions but between 1955 and 1967 it was housed in the Verlorenkost district of the city. In 1957 with the creation <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>new</b> Communities with their own Councils, discretion on location {{was given to the}} current President. In practice this was to be in the Château of Val-Duchesse until the autumn of 1958, at which point it moved to 2 Rue Ravensteinstraat in Brussels.|$|E
5|$|Following the Second World War {{the demand}} for {{electricity}} increased in the United Kingdom. In North East England, {{this led to the}} construction <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>new</b> power stations at Stella, along with the expansion of stations at Dunston and Billingham, to meet {{the demand for}} power quickly. At Blyth, a larger and more efficient plant was planned, consisting of six 100megawatts (MW) generating units. This increased to six 120MW units, before increasing again in the final proposal for an A station consisting of four 120MW units and a B station consisting of two 275MW units and two 350MW units. This gave the A and B stations generating capacities of 480MW and 1,250MW respectively. The Blyth Power Stations were to be an experiment, using a variety of generating set sizes at a time when engineers were trying to standardise power station plant and layout. Blyth was the first in the UK to use generating sets larger than the then standard 30MW and 60MW. The station's location was chosen because of its position within the super grid, rather than to be near a load centre.|$|E

This consisted <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>new</b> Alpha process buildings, 9201-4 and 9201-5, another Beta, 9204-2, {{an extension}} to the Alpha chemistry building, {{and a new}} Beta chemistry building, 9206. When 9206 opened, the old Beta chemistry building, 9203, was converted into a laboratory. Work started on the new Alpha II process buildings on 2 November 1943; the first racetrack was completed in July 1944, and all four were operational by 1 October 1944. The Alpha II racetracks were configured in a linear layout rather than an oval, although they were still called racetracks. In all, there were 864 Alpha calutrons, arranged in nine racetracks of 96. There were only 36 calutrons in each Beta racetrack, {{for a total of}} 288 calutrons, although only 216 of them were ever operated.|$|E
5|$|In 1658, Ottoman {{power was}} {{redirected}} north {{in a campaign}} against George II Rákóczi, Prince of Transylvania, which evolved into a long conflict with the Habsburgs. For the next few years, the Venetian fleet, again {{under the command of}} Morosini, unsuccessfully attempted to maintain the blockade of the Straits of the Dardanelles. Morosini also resumed his tactic of attacking Ottoman strongholds: a siege of the island of Santa Maura (Lefkada) in August 1658 failed, but in 1659, the Venetians, aided by the Maniots, sacked Kalamata in the Peloponnese, followed by Torone in the Chalcidice, Karystos in Euboea, and Çeşme. However, since Venice could not spare forces to occupy these places, these raids gained the Republic nothing of substance. On the Ottoman side, Köprülü Mehmed ordered the construction <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>new</b> forts, Sedd el Bahr ("Rampart of the Sea") and Kilid Bahr ("Key of the Sea"), at the European shore of the entrance of the Dardanelles, to prohibit the Venetians from entering the Straits again.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, the school's name {{changed to}} the Amos Tuck School of Business Administration, and in 1953, the degree program changed {{to the modern}} Master of Business Administration (MBA). Until the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Tuck School catered {{primarily}} to Dartmouth students, accepting undergraduates during their third year. Under Dean Karl Hill, Tuck shifted its focus to soliciting a national student body. The resulting expansion in the late 1960s saw additional growth of the campus {{with the construction of}} a new dormitory and the Murdough Center, which contains the Feldberg Business and Engineering Library. Under Deans Richard West (1976–1983) and Colin Blaydon (1983–1990), the school's curriculum and faculty expanded extensively, and applications increased by one-third. Since the late 1980s, Tuck has continued to expand in student body and faculty size, and has seen the establishment <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>new</b> campus buildings as well as several research centers and nondegree business programs.|$|E
