40|$|Abstract. —Aeration {{allows for}} higher feeding rates and {{increased}} production of channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus in intensive and semi-intensive aquaculture systems.

Six 0. 1 -ha ponds were each equipped with three 0. 37 -kW (0. 5 -hp) aerators and one 0. 37 -kW circulator. Dissolved oxygen concentrations were monitored and recorded with a commercial <b>oxygen</b> <b>monitor</b> that also controlled aeration. During both years, aeration in the high-oxygen treatment was initiated when the DO concentration dropped below 5. 0 mg/L (mean, 64 % saturation from May to September); aeration in the low-oxygen treatment was initiated when the DO concentration dropped below 2. 5 mg/L (32 % saturation; 2001) or 1. 5 mg/L (19 % saturation; 2002).

Dose calculations of cell-free Hb were made as described above. After recovery, pups were returned to a lactating dam and placed in neonatal incubator (Dräger 8000, Drägerwerk AG, Lübeck, Germany) with exposure to either a hyperoxic (fiO 2 0.8) or a normoxic (fiO 2 0.21) condition for 24  h. Oxygen concentrations within the incubators were monitored by the in-built monitoring system of the incubator and crosschecked using a portable <b>oxygen</b> <b>monitor</b> (MX 300 -I, Teledyne Analytical Instruments, Los Angeles, CA, USA). Hyperoxemia was confirmed by blood gas analysis of blood samples obtained by decapitation after 45 min exposure to hyperoxia. Temperature in incubators was kept constant at 28  °C. After the 24 h exposure to hyperoxia or normoxia, animals were housed in room air and room temperature until termination.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{luciferase}} reporters {{has become}} a precise, noninvasive, high-throughput method for real-time monitoring of promoter activity in living cells, especially for rhythmic biological processes such as circadian rhythms.

The continuous output of light from luciferase reporters allowed us to explore the relationship between the cell division cycle and the yeast respiratory oscillation, including the observation of responses to chemicals that cause phase shifting of the respiratory oscillations. Destabilized firefly luciferase is a good reporter of cell cycle position in synchronized or partially synchronized yeast cultures, in both batch and continuous cultures.
