40|$|PURPOSE: Many systems try {{to replace}} Placido disc-based topographers, {{such as those}} based in Scheimpflug principles. The {{purpose of this study}} is to check if they are interchangeable. METHODS: Quantitative {{analysis}} evaluated data obtained from EyeSys and Pentacam, i. e. simulated keratometric values, in addition to flattest and steepest keratometric values. Sixty-three maps from each device (EyeSys scale= 0. 5 D; Pentacam scale= 0. 25 D) were used for the comparison. Qualitative analysis selected 10 EyeSys and 15 Pentacam topographies used in the quantitative evaluation. Aspheric, keratoconus suspects (KS) and established keratoconus corneas were included. Four groups (children [CH], non-physicians adults [AD], residents in ophthalmology [OP] and refractive surgeons [RS]) were asked to match the topographies belonging to the same eye. RESULTS: Analysis showed that the parameters are correlated; however they are not clinically similar. In the qualitative analysis, the percent of correct matches increased when KS was removed. CH group was statistically different from every group in these comparisons. When only KS was considered, CH vs. <b>OP,</b> <b>CH</b> vs. RS and AD vs. RS remained statistically different. AD vs. OP showed no relevant difference in any comparison. CONCLUSIONS: The systems are not fully interchangeable, yet they are correlated. Practitioners who are adapting to Pentacam should use the 0. 25 D scale maps and transform formulas that use EyeSys parameters. Only with persistent training may the topographies be properly matched; KS corneas are more difficult to be correctly paired...|$|E

40|$|Pulmonary infections have diverse presentations in the HIV - {{seropositive}} patient, creating {{difficulty and}} delay in diagnosis and treatment. The chest radiographic appearances of patients presenting with pulmonary symptoms are frequently nonspecific. Furthe r characterization of chest radiographic patterns in correlation with clinical findings and laboratory values {{would be helpful}} in narrowing the differential diagnosis of pulmonary disease in HIV - seropositive patients. The study of the clinical, radiologica l and bacteriological manifestations of pulmonary tuberculosis in relation to CD 4 count in HIV infected patients helps in early detection and treatment of tuberculosis {{so that we can}} prevent the spread of tuberculosis. MATERIAL AND METHOD : this is a Cross sectional study conducted at the department of Pulmonary Medicine, SVRR Government General Hospital, Tirupati during January 2011 To April 2012. Study sample being Total number of patients who attended <b>Chest</b> <b>OP</b> and were admitted in Pulmonary Medicine ward of SVRR Government General Hospital, Tirupati with Tuberculosis and HIV during the study period.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} the relationships between faecal fat concentration and gaseous emissions from pig slurry. Five diets were designed to meet essential nutrient requirements: a control and four experimental feeds including two levels (35 or 70 g/kg) of calcium soap fatty acids distillate (CSP) and 0 or 200 g/kg of orange pulp (OP) combined in a 2 × 2 factorial structure. Thirty growing pigs (six per treatment) were used to measure dry matter (DM) and N balance, coefficients of total tract apparent digestibility (CTTAD) of nutrients, faecal and urine composition and potential emissions of ammonia (NH 3) and methane (CH 4). Increasing dietary CSP level decreased DM, ether extract (EE) and crude protein (CP) CTTAD (by 4. 0, 11. 1 and 3. 5 %, respectively, P < 0. 05), but did not influence those of fibrous constituents. It also led to a decrease (from 475 to 412 g/kg DM, P < 0. 001) of faecal concentration of neutral detergent fibre (aNDFom) and to an increment (from 138 to 204 g/kg, P < 0. 001) of EE in faecal DM that was related to greater CH 4 emissions, both per gram of organic matter (P = 0. 021) or on a daily basis (P < 0. 001). Level of CSP did not affect N content in faeces or urine, but increased daily DM (P < 0. 001), and N (P = 0. 031) faecal excretion with no effect on urine N excretion. This resulted in lesser (P = 0. 036) NH 3 potential emission per kg of slurry. Addition of OP decreased CTTAD of EE (by 7. 9 %, P = 0. 044), but increased (P < 0. 05) that of all the fibrous fractions. As a consequence, faecal EE content increased (from 165 to 177 g/kg DM; P = 0. 012), and aNDFom decreased greatly (from 483 to 404 g/kg DM, P < 0. 001), which in all resulted in a lack of effect of <b>OP</b> on <b>CH</b> 4 potential emission. Inclusion of OP in the diet also led to a significant decrease of CP CTTAD (by 6. 85 %, P < 0. 001), and to an increase of faecal CP concentration (from 174 to 226 g/kg DM, P < 0. 001), with no significant influence on urine N content. These effects resulted in higher N faecal losses, especially those of the undigested dietary origin, without significant effects on potential NH 3 emission. No significant interactions between CSP and OP supplementation were observed for the gaseous emissions measured...|$|R
