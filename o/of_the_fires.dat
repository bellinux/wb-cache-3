5|$|In the {{aftermath}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fires,</b> erosion {{was a particular}} concern, especially as the rains were heavy the following year. Helicopters dropped {{millions of gallons of}} water on the fires, and water retrieval from a few small creeks actually dropped the water level temporarily. Stream flow was also affected by water-pumping operations. The more than a million gallons of diammonium phosphate-based fire-retardant material polluted some streams, but this too was transient and had no long term ill effects on water quality. Fire fighting foams used on wildfires differ from those used for other situations such as fuel fires. They are very low in toxicity and were believed to have completely dispersed by the spring of 1989.|$|E
5|$|Since Yellowstone {{is one of}} {{the most}} famous {{national}} parks in the world, news coverage was extensive and sometimes sensational. Federal officials sometimes had only limited information to present to the media. The National Park Service received some 3,000 media requests, not all of which the two park public information officers were able to grant, even with the assistance of a staff of over 40 employees. 16 more park personnel were assigned the role of liaisons with the media where fire fighting manpower was concentrated. By the time the fires were under control in mid-November, the park was still receiving 40 to 70 media requests daily. Media coverage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> brought the National Park Service more national attention than it had ever received, and the 1988 fire season has been called one of the most important events in the history of that agency.|$|E
5|$|The Chicago riot lasted {{almost a}} week, ending {{only after the}} {{government}} had deployed nearly 6,000 National Guard infantrymen. They stationed them around the Black Belt to prevent any further white attacks. By the evening of July 30, most violence had ended. The majority of the rioting, murder, and arson {{was the result of}} white ethnic groups attacking the African American population in the city's Black Belt on the South Side. Most of the casualties and property damage were suffered by black Chicagoans. Newspaper accounts noted numerous attempts at arson; for instance, on July 31, more than 30 fires were started in the Black Belt before noon and all were believed to be arson. Rioters stretched cables across the streets to prevent fire trucks from entering the areas. The mayor's office was informed of a plan to burn down the black area of Chicago and run its residents out of town. There were also sporadic violent attacks {{in other parts of the}} city, including the Chicago Loop. Because of the rioting, 38 people died (23 African American and 15 white), and another 537 were injured, two-thirds of them African American. Patrolman John W. Simpson was the only policeman killed in the riot. Approximately 1,000 residents, mostly African Americans, were left homeless because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fires.</b> Many African American families had left by train before the rioting ended, returning to their families in the South.|$|E

50|$|Wind {{speed and}} land slope, like a {{mountain}} where <b>the</b> Beaver Creek <b>Fire</b> took place, influences <b>fire</b> behavior, specifically <b>the</b> spread <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> Wind makes fire grow faster. As wind speed increase, <b>the</b> spread <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> increases {{more quickly and}} can help increase <b>the</b> intensity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> Fire can even create some of its own wind to disperse the heat downward from <b>the</b> heart <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flame to the unburnt fuel ahead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> which helps in <b>the</b> rate <b>of</b> spread <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> and increases <b>the</b> longevity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> Some argue {{that the increase in}} <b>the</b> spread rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> from <b>the</b> windy conditions {{has to do with the}} increased oxygen supply in <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> Others argue that this is not true because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fact that <b>fires</b> need a sufficient amount of oxygen to even start. Without wind, it is easier to stop a <b>fire</b> due to <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> not being pushed forward. Slope <b>of</b> land increases <b>the</b> spread <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> only and not the intensity. The reason for this is gravity pushes <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> down so that the area in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> is heated up quicker and able to burn faster allowing <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> to burn more area in a period of time up a slope, even without wind, than just on flat ground.|$|R
