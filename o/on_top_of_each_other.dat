5|$|As a ceratopsid, Achelousaurus {{would have}} been a quadrupedal animal with hoofed digits and a shortened, {{downwards}} swept tail. Its very large head, which would have rested on a straight neck, had a hooked upper beak, very large nasal openings and long tooth rows developed into dental batteries that contained hundreds of appressed and stacked individual teeth. In the tooth sockets, new teeth grew under the old ones, each position housing a column of teeth posed <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> Achelousaurus had 25 to 28 such tooth positions in each maxilla (upper jaw bone).|$|E
5|$|Such {{landslides}} {{are common}} at volcanoes, {{where they are}} favoured by the steep edifices that form from lava flows being stacked <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> It is not usually known what triggers the collapse, although eruption-associated earthquakes are suspected to play a role. Other volcanoes in the region with sector collapses are: Lastarria, Ollague, San Pedro, Socompa, and Tata Sabaya. The Mellado and Cerro Rosado volcanoes close to Llullaillaco also display evidence of sector collapses.|$|E

5|$|The oldest graves are to {{the north}} of the church, which is unusual: ordinarily the {{southern}} part of the churchyard would be used first for burials, with the northern part remaining unconsecrated unless and until extra space for graves was required. The path between the road and the church has sunken, which may partly be explained by the medieval custom of burying the dead <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> One author has suggested that the mound alongside the path might indicate that the church is located in the site of a Bronze Age settlement.|$|E
5|$|In the Cretaceous, {{a shallow}} seaway spread into the {{interior}} of North America from the Gulf of Mexico in the south into Utah and later to the Arctic Ocean in the far north. Geologists call this shallow sea the Cretaceous Seaway or Western Interior Seaway. The seaway divided North America into two halves: an eastern portion dominated by the already ancient Appalachian Mountains and a western part composed primarily of the still growing Sevier Mountains; formed from shallow thrust faulting caused by the Sevier orogeny. As the shoreline moved back and forth, the Bryce area alternated from {{being part of the}} Sevier landmass to being under the Cretaceous Seaway. Alternating layers of nonmarine, intertidal, and marine sediments lay <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> as a result.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} preserved ancient Egyptian temples, such {{as those}} at Giza, consist of single, enclosed halls with roof slabs supported by columns. In the New Kingdom, architects added the pylon, the open courtyard, and the enclosed hypostyle hall {{to the front of}} the temple's sanctuary, a style that was standard until the Greco-Roman period. The earliest and most popular tomb architecture in the Old Kingdom was the mastaba, a flat-roofed rectangular structure of mudbrick or stone built over an underground burial chamber. The step pyramid of Djoser is a series of stone mastabas stacked <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> Pyramids were built during the Old and Middle Kingdoms, but most later rulers abandoned them in favor of less conspicuous rock-cut tombs. The Twenty-fifth dynasty was a notable exception, as all Twenty-fifth dynasty pharaohs constructed pyramids.|$|E

5|$|These guanine-rich {{sequences}} may stabilize chromosome ends {{by forming}} structures of stacked sets of four-base units, {{rather than the}} usual base pairs found in other DNA molecules. Here, four guanine bases form a flat plate and these flat four-base units then stack <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> to form a stable G-quadruplex structure. These structures are stabilized by hydrogen bonding between {{the edges of the}} bases and chelation of a metal ion in the centre of each four-base unit. Other structures can also be formed, with the central set of four bases coming from either a single strand folded around the bases, or several different parallel strands, each contributing one base to the central structure.|$|E
5|$|Sailors {{on nearby}} ships heard {{the series of}} signals and, realizing that a {{collision}} was imminent, gathered to watch as Imo bore down on Mont-Blanc. Though both ships had cut their engines by this point, their momentum carried them right <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> at slow speed. Unable to ground his ship for fear of a shock that would set off his explosive cargo, Mackey ordered Mont-Blanc to steer hard to port (starboard helm) and crossed the Norwegian ship's bows in a last-second bid to avoid a collision. The two ships were almost parallel to each other, when Imo suddenly sent out three signal blasts, indicating the ship was reversing its engines. The combination of the cargoless ship's height {{in the water and}} the transverse thrust of her right-hand propeller caused the ship's head to swing into Mont-Blanc. Imos prow pushed into the French vessel's No. 1 hold on her starboard side.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 19thcentury the {{population}} of London more than doubled, from a little under a million people in 1801 to almost two and a half million in 1851. Despite this rapid growth in population, the amount of land set aside for use as graveyards remained unchanged at approximately , spread across around 200 small sites. The difficulty of digging without disturbing existing graves led to bodies often simply being stacked <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> to fit the available space and covered with a layer of earth. In more crowded areas even relatively fresh graves had to be exhumed to free up space for new burials, their contents being unearthed and scattered to free up space. In some cases large pits were dug on existing burial grounds, unearthing the previous burials, and fresh corpses crammed into the available space. Intact material from burials was sold on a thriving market in second hand coffin furniture, coffin wood was burned as household fuel, and exhumed bones were shipped in bulk to the north of England to be sold as fertiliser. Decaying corpses contaminated the water supply and the city suffered regular epidemics of cholera, smallpox, measles and typhoid; in 1842 the mean working life of a London professional man was 30 years and of a London labourer just 17 years.|$|E
