5|$|Also defined herewith: <b>orbital</b> ring. A visible ring of {{feathers}} around a bird's eye; the eye-ring is often paler than the surrounding feathers. By contrast, an <b>orbital</b> ring is bare skin ringing the eye. In some species, such as little ringed plover, the <b>orbital</b> ring {{may be quite}} conspicuous.|$|E
5|$|At {{the shorter}} <b>orbital</b> period extreme, Encke's Comet has an orbit {{that does not}} reach the orbit of Jupiter, and is known as an Encke-type comet. Short-period comets with <b>orbital</b> periods less than 20 years and low inclinations (up to 30 degrees) to the {{ecliptic}} are called Jupiter-family comets (JFCs). Those like Halley, with <b>orbital</b> periods of between 20 and 200 years and inclinations extending from zero to more than 90 degrees, are called Halley-type comets (HTCs). , only 87 HTCs have been observed, compared with 567 identified JFCs.|$|E
5|$|Disadvantages {{resulting}} from the nature of <b>orbital</b> mechanics would make {{the arrangement of the}} orbits of the swarm extremely complex. The simplest such arrangement is the Dyson ring, in which all such structures share the same orbit. More-complex patterns with more rings would intercept more of the star's output, but would result in some constructs eclipsing others periodically when their orbits overlap. Another potential problem is that the increasing loss of <b>orbital</b> stability when adding more elements increases the probability of <b>orbital</b> perturbations.|$|E
50|$|The basis set {{can either}} be {{composed}} of atomic <b>orbitals</b> (yielding the linear combination of atomic <b>orbitals</b> approach), which is the usual choice within the quantum chemistry community, or plane waves which are typically used within the solid state community. Several types of atomic <b>orbitals</b> can be used: Gaussian-type <b>orbitals,</b> Slater-type <b>orbitals,</b> or numerical atomic <b>orbitals.</b> Out of the three, Gaussian-type <b>orbitals</b> {{are by far the}} most often used, as they allow efficient implementations of Post-Hartree-Fock methods.|$|R
50|$|In this notation, d <b>orbitals</b> of main group atoms {{are listed}} after the s and p <b>orbitals</b> {{since they have}} the same {{principal}} quantum number (n), while d <b>orbitals</b> of transition metals are listed first since the s and p <b>orbitals</b> have a higher n. Thus for AX6 molecules, sp3d2 hybridisation in the S atom involves 3s, 3p and 3d <b>orbitals,</b> while d2sp3 for Mo involves 4d, 5s and 5p <b>orbitals.</b>|$|R
50|$|Molecular <b>orbitals</b> {{are said}} to be {{degenerate}} if they have the same energy. For example, in the homonuclear diatomic molecules of the first ten elements, the molecular <b>orbitals</b> derived from the px and the py atomic <b>orbitals</b> result in two degenerate bonding <b>orbitals</b> (of low energy) and two degenerate antibonding <b>orbitals</b> (of high energy).|$|R

5|$|Haumea has an <b>orbital</b> {{period of}} 284 Earth years, a {{perihelion}} of 35 AU, and an <b>orbital</b> inclination of 28°. It passed aphelion in early 1992, {{and is currently}} more than 50 AU from the Sun. Haumea's orbit has a slightly greater eccentricity {{than that of the}} other members of its collisional family. This is thought to be due to Haumea's weak 7:12 <b>orbital</b> resonance with Neptune gradually modifying its initial orbit {{over the course of a}} billion years, through the Kozai effect, which allows the exchange of an orbit's inclination for increased eccentricity.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} regular {{planetary}} moons, Callisto's rotation is locked to be synchronous with its orbit. The length of Callisto's day, simultaneously its <b>orbital</b> period, is about 16.7 Earth days. Its orbit is very slightly eccentric and inclined to the Jovian equator, with the eccentricity and inclination changing quasi-periodically due to solar and planetary gravitational perturbations on a timescale of centuries. The ranges of change are 0.00720.0076 and 0.200.60°, respectively. These <b>orbital</b> variations cause the axial tilt (the angle between rotational and <b>orbital</b> axes) to vary between 0.4 and 1.6°.|$|E

50|$|When {{the energy}} {{difference}} between the atomic <b>orbitals</b> of two atoms is quite large, one atom's <b>orbitals</b> contribute almost entirely to the bonding <b>orbitals,</b> and the others atom's <b>orbitals</b> contribute almost entirely to the antibonding <b>orbitals.</b> Thus, the situation is effectively that one or more electrons have been transferred from one atom to the other. This is called an (mostly) ionic bond.|$|R
5|$|None of {{the planets}} are in low-ratio <b>orbital</b> resonances, in which {{multiple}} planets gravitationally tug on and stabilize each other's orbits, resulting in simple ratios of their <b>orbital</b> periods. However, b and c are close to a 5:4 ratio.|$|E
5|$|Planetesimals {{within the}} region which would become the {{asteroid}} belt were too strongly perturbed by Jupiter's gravity to form a planet. Instead they continued to orbit the Sun as before, occasionally colliding. In regions where the average velocity of the collisions was too high, the shattering of planetesimals tended to dominate over accretion, preventing the formation of planet-sized bodies. <b>Orbital</b> resonances occurred where the <b>orbital</b> period of an object in the belt formed an integer fraction of the <b>orbital</b> period of Jupiter, perturbing the object into a different orbit; the region lying between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter contains many such <b>orbital</b> resonances. As Jupiter migrated inward following its formation, these resonances would have swept across the asteroid belt, dynamically exciting the region's population and increasing their velocities relative to each other.|$|E
5|$|The <b>orbital</b> angular {{momentum}} of electrons is quantized. Because the electron is charged, it produces an <b>orbital</b> magnetic moment that {{is proportional to}} the {{angular momentum}}. The net magnetic moment of an atom is equal to the vector sum of <b>orbital</b> and spin magnetic moments of all electrons and the nucleus. The magnetic moment of the nucleus is negligible compared with that of the electrons. The magnetic moments of the electrons that occupy the same <b>orbital</b> (so called, paired electrons) cancel each other out.|$|E
50|$|In {{computational}} {{chemistry and}} molecular physics, Gaussian <b>orbitals</b> (also known as Gaussian type <b>orbitals,</b> GTOs or Gaussians) are functions used as atomic <b>orbitals</b> in the LCAO method for {{the representation of}} electron <b>orbitals</b> in molecules and numerous properties that depend on these.|$|R

5000|$|Typically, {{in modern}} Hartree-Fock calculations, the one-electron wave {{functions}} are approximated by a linear combination of atomic <b>orbitals.</b> These atomic <b>orbitals</b> are called Slater-type <b>orbitals.</b> Furthermore, {{it is very}} common for the [...] "atomic orbitals" [...] in use to actually be composed of a linear combination {{of one or more}} Gaussian-type <b>orbitals,</b> rather than Slater-type <b>orbitals,</b> in the interests of saving large amounts of computation time.|$|R

5|$|When {{the mean}} <b>orbital</b> period of an {{asteroid}} is an integer {{fraction of the}} <b>orbital</b> period of Jupiter, a mean-motion resonance with the gas giant is created that is sufficient to perturb an asteroid to new <b>orbital</b> elements. Asteroids that become located in the gap orbits (either primordially because of the migration of Jupiter's orbit, or due to prior perturbations or collisions) are gradually nudged into different, random orbits with a larger or smaller semi-major axis.|$|E
5|$|A close {{binary star}} system occurs when two stars orbit {{each other with}} an average {{separation}} that is of the same order of magnitude as their diameters. At these distances, more complex interactions can occur, such as tidal effects, transfer of mass and even collisions. Tidal interactions in a close binary system can result in modification of the <b>orbital</b> and rotational parameters. The total angular momentum {{of the system is}} conserved, but the angular momentum can be transferred between the <b>orbital</b> periods and the rotation rates.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} Sun, the {{gravitational}} influence of Jupiter has {{helped shape the}} Solar System. The orbits {{of most of the}} system's planets lie closer to Jupiter's <b>orbital</b> plane than the Sun's equatorial plane (Mercury is the only planet that is closer to the Sun's equator in <b>orbital</b> tilt), the Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt are mostly caused by Jupiter, and the planet may have been responsible for the Late Heavy Bombardment of the inner Solar System's history.|$|E
5|$|An {{electron}} can {{be bound}} to the nucleus of an atom by the attractive Coulomb force. A system {{of one or more}} electrons bound to a nucleus is called an atom. If the number of electrons is different from the nucleus' electrical charge, such an atom is called an ion. The wave-like behavior of a bound electron is described by a function called an atomic <b>orbital.</b> Each <b>orbital</b> has its own set of quantum numbers such as energy, angular momentum and projection of angular momentum, and only a discrete set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus. According to the Pauli exclusion principle each <b>orbital</b> can be occupied by up to two electrons, which must differ in their spin quantum number.|$|E
50|$|<b>Orbitals</b> are a model {{representation}} of the behaviour of electrons within molecules.

5|$|Because the Earth's axis is tilted {{relative}} to its <b>orbital</b> plane, sunlight is incident at different angles {{at different times}} of the year. In June the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, so at any given Northern Hemisphere latitude sunlight falls more directly on that spot than in December (see Effect of sun angle on climate). This effect causes seasons. Over thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, changes in Earth's <b>orbital</b> parameters affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate. (See Milankovitch cycles).|$|E
5|$|Currently Umbriel is not {{involved}} in any <b>orbital</b> resonance with other Uranian satellites. Early in its history, however, it may have been in a 1:3 resonance with Miranda. This would have increased Miranda's <b>orbital</b> eccentricity, contributing to the internal heating and geological activity of that moon, while Umbriel's orbit would have been less affected. Due to Uranus's lower oblateness and smaller size relative to its satellites, its moons can escape more easily from a mean motion resonance than those of Jupiter or Saturn. After Miranda escaped from this resonance (through a mechanism that probably resulted in its anomalously high <b>orbital</b> inclination), its eccentricity would have been damped, turning off the heat source.|$|E
