25|$|Still Life is a {{work about}} work. About confronting {{physical}} matter in order to elevate <b>our</b> <b>existence</b> above it. It is an attempt towards a kind of theatre that generates meditative energy through simple actions, and encourages an emotional journey through optical illusions.|$|E
25|$|The {{basic premise}} {{proceeds}} from {{the assumption that the}} probability of a world coming into existence exactly like our own is greater than zero (we know this because our world exists). If space and time are infinite, then it follows logically that <b>our</b> <b>existence</b> must recur an infinite number of times.|$|E
25|$|One {{can also}} look at this from the {{perspective}} of what the meaning of <b>our</b> <b>existence</b> is. Why suffer what humans have suffered, the pain and despair—what meaning can all of this have? For Kierkegaard, there is no meaning unless passion, the emotions and will of humans, has a divine source.|$|E

25|$|A {{division}} between Force and consciousness in evolution: matter, life and mind are often warring with each other. Materialists {{try to resolve}} this war by submitting oneself to the mortality of our being, while ascetics have tried to reject earthly life. A true solution may lie in finding the principle beyond mind, thereby overcoming the mortality of <b>our</b> <b>existence.</b>|$|E
25|$|Archetypes {{abound in}} {{contemporary}} films and literature {{as they have}} in creative works of the past, being unconscious projections of the collective unconscious that serve to embody central societal and developmental struggles in a media that entertain as well as instruct. Films are a contemporary form of mythmaking, reflecting our response to ourselves and the mysteries and wonders of <b>our</b> <b>existence.</b>|$|E
25|$|Heideggerians {{regarded}} Søren Kierkegaard as, by far, {{the greatest}} philosophical contributor to Heidegger's own existentialist concepts. Heidegger's concepts of anxiety (Angst) and mortality draw on Kierkegaard and are {{indebted to the}} way in which the latter lays out the importance of our subjective relation to truth, <b>our</b> <b>existence</b> in the face of death, the temporality of existence, and the importance of passionate affirmation of one's individual being-in-the-world.|$|E

25|$|One of the Buddhist sutras {{states that}} {{a hundred years}} of <b>our</b> <b>existence</b> is equal to one day and one night {{in the world of}} the thirty-three gods.

500|$|The {{dominant}} {{school of}} philosophy in Scotland {{in the late}} eighteenth century and the first half of the nineteenth century is known as Common Sense Realism. It argued that there are certain concepts, such as <b>our</b> <b>existence,</b> the existence of solid objects and some basic moral [...] "first principles", that are intrinsic to our make-up and from which all subsequent arguments and systems of morality must be derived. It can be seen as an attempt to reconcile the new scientific developments of the Enlightenment with religious belief. The origins of these arguments are in a reaction to the scepticism that became dominant in the Enlightenment, particularly that articulated by Scottish philosopher David Hume (1711–76). This branch of thinking was first formulated by Thomas Reid (1710–96) in his An Inquiry into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common Sense (1764). It was popularised in Scotland by figures including Dugald Stewart (1753–1828) and in England by James Beattie. Stewart's students included Walter Scott, Walter Chambers and Thomas Brown, and this branch of thought would later be a major influence on Charles Darwin. William Hamilton (1788–1856) attempted to combine Reid's approach with the philosophy of Kant.|$|E
500|$|The modern {{concept of}} {{molecules}} {{can be traced}} back towards pre-scientific and Greek philosophers such as Leucippus who argued that all the universe is composed of atoms and voids. Circa 450 BC Empedocles imagined fundamental elements (fire (...) , earth (...) , air (...) , and water (...) [...] ) and [...] "forces" [...] of attraction and repulsion allowing the elements to interact. Prior to this, Heraclitus had claimed that fire or change was fundamental to <b>our</b> <b>existence,</b> created through the combination of opposite properties. [...] In the Timaeus, Plato, following Pythagoras, considered mathematical entities such as number, point, line and triangle as the fundamental building blocks or elements of this ephemeral world, and considered the four elements of fire, air, water and earth as states of substances through which the true mathematical principles or elements would pass. A fifth element, the incorruptible quintessence aether, was considered to be the fundamental building block of the heavenly bodies. The viewpoint of Leucippus and Empedocles, along with the aether, was accepted by Aristotle and passed to medieval and renaissance Europe. A modern conceptualization of molecules began to develop in the 19th century along with experimental evidence for pure chemical elements and how individual atoms of different chemical substances such as hydrogen and oxygen can combine to form chemically stable molecules such as water molecules.|$|E
500|$|The Irish proved {{very tough}} negotiators, {{so much so}} that Chamberlain complained that one of de Valera's offers had [...] "presented United Kingdom ministers with a three-leafed shamrock, none of the leaves of which had any {{advantages}} for the UK". With the talks facing deadlock, Chamberlain made the Irish a final offer in March 1938 which acceded to many Irish positions, though he was confident that he had [...] "only given up the small things", and the agreements were signed on 25 April 1938. The issue of partition was not resolved, but the Irish agreed to pay £10million to the British. There was no provision in the treaties for British access to the Treaty Ports in time of war, but Chamberlain accepted de Valera's oral assurance that in the event of war the British would have access. The agreements were attacked by Conservative backbencher Winston Churchill in Parliament for surrendering the Treaty Ports, which Churchill described as the [...] "sentinel towers of the Western Approaches". When war came, de Valera denied Britain access to the Treaty Ports under Irish neutrality. Churchill railed against these treaties in The Gathering Storm, stating that he [...] "never saw the House of Commons more completely misled" [...] and that [...] "members were made to feel very differently about it when <b>our</b> <b>existence</b> hung in the balance during the Battle of the Atlantic". Chamberlain, however, believed that the Treaty Ports were unusable if Ireland was hostile, and deemed their loss worthwhile to assure friendly relations with Dublin.|$|E
