40|$|Abstract. In {{the rolling}} bearing, the flaking caused by rolling contact fatigue is {{classified}} into two types: surface <b>originated</b> flaking and subsurface <b>originated</b> flaking. It {{has been recognized}} that marked microstructural change can occur in subsurface <b>originated</b> flaking due to rolling contact fatigue. But there are few reports in surface <b>originated</b> flaking about microstructural change. In this study, surface <b>originated</b> flaking caused by rolling contact fatigue was investigated based on microstructural change. Thrust ball bearing and radial ball bearing was used for fatigue test. Simulation of dent <b>originated</b> flaking was carried out using the bearing with artificial dent. Another fatigue test subjected to surface <b>originated</b> flaking was done under shortage of oil film thickness lubrication condition. Microstructural change was measured by X-ray Diffractmetry (XRD) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) during fatigue testing. Microstructure of bearing steel used for fatigue test is consisted of martensite with small amount of retained austenite. XRD measurement reveals that the half peak width of martensite and volume fraction of retained austenite decreasing with increasing testing time, {{and the amount of}} decrease in these parameter were small in the surface <b>originated</b> flaking compared with subsurface <b>originated</b> flaking when the specimens were flaking. This suggests that surface <b>originated</b> flaking occurs in spite of mild microstructural change. TEM observation about the surface <b>originated</b> flaking shows plastic flow in the surface layer. Especially, it was confirmed that partial recrystallization occurs in the fatigue test under shortage of oil film thickness lubrication condition. But it was also confirmed that degree of recrystallization is lower in the surface <b>originated</b> flaking than subsurface one, and this reasonably explains XRD result. From these results, it was cleared that recrystallizaiton of martensite is differ in degree but not in kind between surface <b>originated</b> flaking and subsurface <b>originated</b> flaking...|$|R

5|$|Comets {{usually have}} highly {{eccentric}} elliptical orbits, {{and they have}} a wide range of orbital periods, ranging from several years to potentially several millions of years. Short-period comets <b>originate</b> in the Kuiper belt or its associated scattered disc, which lie beyond the orbit of Neptune. Long-period comets are thought to <b>originate</b> in the Oort cloud, a spherical cloud of icy bodies extending from outside the Kuiper belt to halfway to the nearest star. Long-period comets are set in motion towards the Sun from the Oort cloud by gravitational perturbations caused by passing stars and the galactic tide. Hyperbolic comets may pass once through the inner Solar System before being flung to interstellar space. The appearance of a comet is called an apparition.|$|E
