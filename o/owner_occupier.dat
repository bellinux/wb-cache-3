50|$|Having {{separate}} estates for owner occupiers {{and council}} tenants reinforced class divisions and class stereotyping.

The house continued to be leased out until 1914, despite a change of ownership to James Jackes in 1882. Jackes was responsible for renaming the house [...] "Toronto" [...] after his birthplace, and for subdividing the property into two allotments in 1911.

The Building Control Act 1966 introduced building licensing to {{give priority to}} housing construction. Under the Supplementary Benefit Act 1966, an <b>owner</b> <b>occupier</b> on benefits was entitled to an allowance for repairs, insurance, rates, and [...] "reasonable" [...] interest charges on a mortgage. A Land Commission was also established to purchase land for building and therefore prevent profiteering in land values, although it only had limited success. The aim of the Land Commission was to purchase land for public goods such as housing or shopping redevelopment (compulsorily, if the need arose), and investigated the planning needs of a particular area {{in conjunction with the}} Ministry of Housing and some planning authorities to see if any land in any particular area would be needed for such developmental schemes. Although the Land Commission purchased substantial quantities of land, it did not become the dominant influence in the land market that the government had hoped for.|$|E
5000|$|A roommate is {{a person}} with whom one shares a living {{facility}} such as an apartment or dormitory. Similar terms include dormmate, suitemate, housemate, flatmate ("flat": the usual term in British English for an apartment - in New Zealand, [...] "flatmate" [...] is solely used, {{regardless of whether the}} dwelling is an apartment or a detached house), or sharemate (shared living spaces are often called sharehomes in Australia and other Commonwealth countries). A sharehome is a model of household in which a group of usually unrelated people reside together. The term generally applies to people living together in rental properties rather than in properties in which any resident is an <b>owner</b> <b>occupier.</b> In the UK, the term [...] "roommate" [...] means a person living in the same bedroom, whereas in the United States and Canada, [...] "roommate" [...] and [...] "housemate" [...] are used interchangeably regardless whether a bedroom is shared, although it is common in US universities that having a roommate implies sharing a room together. This article uses the term [...] "roommate" [...] in the US sense of a person one shares a residence with who is not a relative or significant other. The informal term for roommate is roomie, which is commonly used by university students.|$|E

40|$|For modern nations, it is {{recognized}} as important that temporal and spatial variations in costs for comparable dwelling services are carefully measured. The costs of owner occupied as well as rental housing have important roles to play in both {{the consumer price index}} (CPI) and the System of National Accounts (SNA). The 1993 System of National Accounts (SNA 93) specifies that a rental value of the housing stock should be included as part of the aggregates for personal consumption, personal income, income of proprietors and value added for the real estate industry. Yet, little attention has been devoted to an underlying commonality of practice: the implicit assumption that housing cost information for either renters or <b>owner</b> <b>occupiers</b> can be used for assessing movements over time and spatial differences in the cost of housing for both renters and owners, after allowing for differences regarding payment for taxes and certain ongoing expenses such as insurance and utilities. But in the real world, are the services that renters and <b>owner</b> <b>occupiers</b> get from their dwellings comparable? Also, for both renters and <b>owner</b> <b>occupiers,</b> are there place-related differences in the services they derive from their dwellings? And if so, what are the implications for official statistics making? These are the questions raised by the empirical results presented in this paper.

50|$|Central Equity {{continued}} {{construction of}} several blocks of apartment buildings on {{much of the}} Southbank land, which it had acquired including Riverside Place, The Summit, Sentinel, Victoria Tower, Melbourne Tower and City Tower. Central Equity apartments are aimed at both the <b>owner</b> <b>occupier</b> and rental market with management provided by Melbourne Inner City Management (MICM), a fully owned subsidiary of Central Equity. With a boom in apartment building {{and the success of}} the Melburnian, the areas closer to the river began to attract developers. The 91 floor Eureka Tower was begun in 2002, aimed at being the tallest residential tower in the world and was completed in 2006. As part of the initial construction of Southgate, St Johns Lutheran Church relocated from the land that is now the site of the Herald Sun building a few metres up City Road, to 20 City Road, and serves the Southbank community as a church and spiritual centre. The Church can be accessed either from City Rd or from the Southgate Shopping complex. The Queensbridge Precinct began development in 2005 with Freshwater Place. A plaza linked to the north bank and Flinders Street Station via a pedestrian and cycle path developed from the Sandridge Bridge. The formerly disused bridge was opened to the public on 12 March 2006, {{just in time for the}} 2006 Commonwealth Games. The Northbank promenade was completed later in 2006 to link the sections.|$|E
5000|$|Southgate, Sheraton Towers and new tall office {{buildings}} for The Herald and Weekly Times Ltd and IBM were built {{along with an}} award winning pedestrian footbridge {{at about the same}} time in late 1992, and combined with a new Sunday arts and crafts market, attracted locals and tourists to the area. At the eastern end of the area is the Victorian Arts Centre. Since then, the pylon underneath the award winning Southbank Pedestrian Bridge has been utilised and is now home to Ponyfish Island. Further buildings including the Esso headquarters were built between 1992 and 1995. Development expanded along the Yarra westward, with the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre ("Jeff's Shed") in 1996 and Crown Casino in 1997, stimulating the first residential towers. In 2001, the boutique [...] "Melburnian" [...] apartments, designed by Bates Smart, were one of the first to be aimed at the <b>owner</b> <b>occupier</b> market and included the most expensive penthouse sold in Melbourne at the time. Clarendon Towers also attracted the owner occupiers. Beginning with Southbank Towers in 1997, Central Equity began a swathe of apartment towers. In 2002 the neighbouring Yarra's Edge precinct of the new Melbourne Docklands began to kick off. The arts precinct was extended with the construction of the award winning buildings for the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art in 2002 and the Victorian College of the Arts school of drama. At around the same time a new headquarters for the State Emergency Service was built.|$|E

The empirical analysis, based on an adaptation of Rosen's two-step model, reveals that the most important determinants of the demand for housing attributes are income, price of the attribute in question, household size, and the occupational status of the head of household. The paper further indicates that the demand for housing attributes is inelastic since all estimated coefficients are below unity. ...|$|E

40|$|This conference {{paper was}} {{presented}} at Retrofit 2012 If the UK is to meet its carbon reduction targets, {{it will be necessary}} to retrofit energy saving measures into the majority of homes. With approximately three quarters of the houses that will exist in 2050 already built, this presents an enormous task. Whilst retrofit of social housing can be undertaken at scale, encouraging people who are owner occupiers to make changes to their homes presents more of a challenge. Within this <b>owner</b> <b>occupier</b> group there are 4. 5 million homes that are also hard to treat, having solid walls, and so many of the retrofit measures available will not be suitable. This paper reports case study research based on 20 UK <b>owner</b> <b>occupier</b> households. It presents the results of a thematic analysis based on semi–structured interviews with the 34 adult members of the households that explored the home improvement experiences of the participants from when they brought the house. The barriers that deter people from making improvements to their homes and therefore implementing energy efficiency measures are presented. The findings highlight a range of interrelated and sometimes rather intangible barriers to making home improvements to older, hard to treat properties. It is essential for these sometimes subtle issues to be understood in order for policy makers to suitably engage home owners in taking up energy saving measures and to inform the requirements for skilled professionals and their involvement in the process...|$|E

Most censuses and surveys simply ask whether the household living in a sampled house (or apartment, etc) currently rents or owns that house.
