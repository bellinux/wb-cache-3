In Cleveland, Ohio, after an officer was acquitted at trial in the shooting of Timothy Russell and Malissa Williams, BLM protested.

40|$|Paule Marshall {{has charged}} that the {{portrayal}} <b>of</b> the <b>black</b> <b>woman</b> in literature has been limited to stereotypes and fantasy figures, and that the writers of fiction have not presented the <b>black</b> <b>woman</b> as a complex and credible character. In her challenge to black writers to create such complex characters, Paule Marshall cites her own works as exemplary models <b>of</b> how the <b>black</b> <b>woman</b> should be portrayed. A careful examination <b>of</b> the <b>black</b> <b>woman</b> as a character in Paule Marshall 2 ̆ 7 s Brown Girl, Brownstones, Soul Clap Hands and Sing and The Chosen Place, The Timeless People demonstrates that Paule Marshall provides in her fiction realistic representations <b>of</b> the <b>black</b> <b>woman.</b> In these works the <b>black</b> <b>woman</b> appears {{in a variety of}} plots, settings and conflicts which depicts the many dimensions <b>of</b> <b>black</b> womanhood. Paule Marshall captures {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} women struggling for survival, surmounting obstacles to realize goals, and searching for identity. Through a combination of diversified characterizations, Paule Marshall projects positive images <b>of</b> the <b>black</b> <b>woman...</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1896, the National Association of Colored Women {{was formed}} to promote the needs <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>women.</b> Bethune served as the Florida chapter {{president}} of the NACW from 1917 to 1925. She worked to register black voters, which was resisted by white society and had been made almost impossible {{by a variety of}} obstacles in Florida law and practices controlled by white administrators. She was threatened by members of the resurgent Ku Klux Klan in those years. Bethune also served {{as the president of the}} Southeastern Federation of Colored Women's Clubs from 1920 to 1925, which worked to improve opportunities for black women.|$|E
5|$|Beyonce has crafted her brand around {{embracing}} femininity {{and female}} sexuality. Although as Dr. Cheryl Thompson explains {{in her article}} “The sweet taste of lemonade: Beyonce serves up black feminist history most recent album,” Beyonce is only recently exploring the intersecting themes of feminism and black empowerment in her work. According to Thompson, Beyonce - like many other black female artists - has held back with her identity as a black woman {{for the sake of}} appealing to the masses. Like the SNL skit that pokes fun at white Beyonce fans that listened to “Lemonade” and realized {{for the first time that}} Beyonce is indeed a black woman, it is only very recently that the artist has transformed her feminist image into something more specific to the issues black women face. As Thompson explains, all of Beyonce’s previous albums were about feminism. “Lemonade” is about black feminism. The importance of having artistry like “Lemonade” in the mainstream is critical to examining the lived experiences <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>women,</b> and the racial and gender-based oppression that intersect to create a unique set of obstacles.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, Thurman {{founded the}} Aframerican Women’s Journal, the first {{publishing}} vehicle of the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW), which she edited from 1940 until 1944. In 1941, an archive committee {{was formed to}} design a plan for collecting works about the achievements of African-American women. Though their plans focused primarily on written records and professional accomplishment and would thus reflect middle-class life, the committee initiated work on collecting historical records <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>women.</b> In 1944, Thurman became the committee's chair and her mother donated $1,000 toward creating the National Council of Negro Women's National Library, Archives, and Museum. On June 30, 1946, they held an archive drive, printing notices in newsletters and asking ministers, organizations, librarians and others to help them acquire photographs, books and mementos. They opened the first facility of the library at {{what is now the}} Mary McLeod Bethune Council House National Historic Site.|$|E

5|$|Thurman {{played an}} active role in {{establishing}} international student organizations to help prevent foreign students feeling isolated while studying abroad. She organized one of the first international scholarship programs for African-American women. She studied racism and the effects of prejudice on various people throughout the world, making two round-the-world trips in her lifetime. She wrote books and newspaper articles to preserve black heritage, and initiated the publishing efforts of the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW) by founding the Aframerican Women’s Journal. In addition to writing the second ever history of black Californians, in 1958 Thurman published a cookbook laced with historical information about black professional women at a time when African Americans had few civil rights. Recognizing that there was little academic interest in black women's history at the time, Thurman used the marketing ploy of food to report on the lives <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>women</b> who were not domestics. She participated in international peace and feminist conferences, and in 1945 attended the San Francisco Conference for the founding of the United Nations as part of an unofficial delegation. Thurman also established museums such as the Museum of Afro-American History in Boston in 1963.|$|E

25|$|Black female {{artists such}} as Queen Latifah, Missy Elliott, and MC Lyte have made great strides since the hip hop {{industry}} first began. By producing music and an image that did not cater to the hyper-sexualized stereotypes <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>women</b> in hip hop, these women pioneered a revitalized and empowering image <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>women</b> in hip hop. Though many hip hop artists have embraced the ideals that effectively disenfranchise black female artists, many others choose to employ forms of resistance that counteract these negative portrayals of women in hip hop and offer a different narrative. These artists seek to expand ways of traditional thinking through different ways of cultural expression. In this effort they hope to elicit a response to female hip hop artists not with a misogynist lens but with one that validates women's struggle.|$|E

25|$|Many African female {{diasporic}} {{artists have}} criticized the traditional iconography of Baartman. According to the studies of contemporary feminists, traditional iconography and historical illustrations of Baartman are effective in revealing the ideological representation <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>women</b> in art throughout history. Such studies assess how the traditional iconography of the black female body was institutionally and scientifically defined in the nineteenth century.|$|E

25|$|Black feminist {{criminology}} is {{the solution}} to this problem.

Three, it looks at Black intimate and familial relations. And four, it looks at the Black woman as an individual. These four factors will help distinguish Black women from Black males into an accurate branch of learning in the criminal justice system.|$|E
