5|$|Glamorgan sausage (Welsh: Selsig Morgannwg) is a {{traditional}} Welsh vegetarian sausage for which the main ingredients are cheese (usually Caerphilly), leeks and breadcrumbs. The earliest published mention of the dish is from the 1850s in the book Wild Wales by George Borrow, although earlier records in the Glamorgan Archives show a version which contains pork. The modern vegetarian version became popular during the Second World War when meat was harder to come by, and is now mass-produced by at least two companies. Variations include swapping the leeks for onions, as well as different herbs and spices, and various types <b>of</b> <b>cheese.</b>|$|E
5|$|Glamorgan {{sausages}} {{are thought}} to have been originally made with Glamorgan cheese which is no longer made due to the near-extinction of the Glamorgan cattle from which it was produced.

5|$|In modern versions, Caerphilly {{cheese is}} used, {{which is a}} {{descendant}} of the old traditional Glamorgan cheese recipe and lends the same general texture and flavour.

The mixture is then rolled into sausage shapes, and then fried.

5|$|The {{basic concept}} of Gibanica, a cake or pie {{involving}} {{a combination of}} pastry with cheese in differentiated layers often combined with layers of various other fillings, is common in the cuisines of the Balkans, Anatolia, and the Eastern Mediterranean.

Gibanica can also be considered to resemble a type <b>of</b> <b>cheese</b> strudel, with which it likely shares a common ancestry in the pastry dishes of the region, and the cuisines of the Byzantine and Ottoman empires.|$|E
5|$|Gibanica {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular and {{recognizable}} pastry dishes from the Balkans, whether served on festive occasions, or as a comforting family snack. In Serbia, the dish is often consumed at traditional events such as Christmas, Easter and Slava. According to the Serbian media, the largest Gibanica ever made was in the town of Mionica in 2007. It weighed over 1,000 kg, and was applied for inclusion in the Guinness Book of Records. 330kg of phyllo dough, 330kg <b>of</b> <b>cheese,</b> 3,300 eggs, 30 l. of oil, 110 l. of mineral water, 50kg of lard and 500 packets of baking powder went into its creation. In Serbia, as well as in neighboring countries, there are festivals dedicated to pies. One of them, called the Gibanica festival or Days of Banitsa, is held each year in Bela Palanka. It first took place in 2005.|$|E

The main goals are to describe and clarify the production technology of this sort <b>of</b> <b>cheeses,</b> briefly characterize {{the history of their}} production and illustrate the requirements for basic ingredients, i. e. milk, starter culture and annatto coloring. Moreover, the corresponding technological processes are explained and described as clearly as possible, with an emphasis on the process of cheddarization, which is both specific and unique in cheese production. In addition, the thesis discusses chemical compositions, nutrition values and assortments <b>of</b> <b>cheeses</b> with milled curd both on the Czech and the global market, especially in English-speaking countries. The practical part deals with different opinions of consumers and evaluates their interest in various types <b>of</b> natural matured <b>cheeses...</b>|$|R

5|$|Cheese was {{far more}} {{important}} as a foodstuff, especially for common people, {{and it has been}} suggested that it was, during many periods, the chief supplier of animal protein among the lower classes. Many varieties <b>of</b> <b>cheese</b> eaten today, like Dutch Edam, Northern French Brie and Italian Parmesan, were available and well known in late medieval times. There were also whey cheeses, like ricotta, made from by-products of the production of harder cheeses. Cheese was used in cooking for pies and soups, the latter being common fare in German-speaking areas. Butter, another important dairy product, was in popular use in the regions of Northern Europe that specialized in cattle production in the latter half of the Middle Ages, the Low Countries and Southern Scandinavia. While most other regions used oil or lard as cooking fats, butter was the dominant cooking medium in these areas. Its production also allowed for a lucrative butter export from the 12th century onward.|$|E
