Kennan initiated a series <b>of</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> exploit the schism between the Soviets and Josip Broz Tito's Yugoslavia. Kennan proposed conducting covert action in the Balkans to further decrease Moscow's influence.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} an early example <b>of</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> move beyond theater {{blocking}} conventions.

5|$|The idea of {{creating}} a heritage streetcar system in Astoria, as part <b>of</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> redevelop and revitalize the riverfront area, had first been raised in 1980, long after {{the closure of the}} city's streetcar-transit system, which operated from 1892 to 1924. An attempt by city officials to acquire a trolley car in 1986 was dropped in the face of high insurance costs.|$|E

5|$|After World War II, MD410 was {{extended}} even further east and saw significant improvement on its extant sections. By 1946, MD410 {{was extended}} over Ager Road, Hamilton Street, 38th Avenue, and Jefferson Avenue, roads then designated MD209, {{to a new}} eastern terminus at US 1 in Hyattsville. In addition, the pre-1946 course saw completion <b>of</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> widen the road to 40 feet. The highway between Connecticut Avenue (then MD193) and Georgia Avenue (US29) was widened in 1946 and 1947. The two segments between Wisconsin Avenue (US 240) and Connecticut Avenue (MD193) and between MD650 in Takoma Park and US1 in Hyattsville were widened in 1950.|$|E

5|$|Beebe {{described}} his religious beliefs {{as a combination}} of Presbyterianism and Buddhism. His religion was largely the result of seeking to combine his sense of awe and wonder at the natural world with a scientific understanding of its workings. He was highly critical <b>of</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> use science to justify political ideologies, such as socialism or the belief that women were inferior to men. Beebe also disapproved of the eugenic ideas advocated by many biologists in the early 20th century, including some of his contemporaries at the zoo, although this was largely {{out of fear that}} these ideas would alienate friends of the zoo and cause divisions among its staff.|$|E
5|$|Communally, {{conditions}} for black Harlemites improved by 1943, with better employment in civil services, for instance. Economic problems became exacerbated under wartime conditions; new war and non-war industries and business continued {{to discriminate against}} blacks. Though new projects such as the Harlem River Houses were intended to expand black housing, by 1943, overall Harlem housing had deteriorated as new construction slowed due to diversion <b>of</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> the war, and buildings were destroyed in preparation for replacement. Although the state of African Americans improved relative to society, individuals could not accelerate their own progress.|$|E

5|$|For the {{purposes}} of analysis, {{it is possible to}} separate efficiency (achieving a given objective at lowest cost) and equity (fairness). Economists generally agree that to regulate emissions efficiently, all polluters need to face the full costs of their actions (that is, the full marginal social costs of their actions). Regulation of emissions that is applied only to one economic sector or region drastically reduces the efficiency <b>of</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> reduce global emissions. There is, however, no scientific consensus over how to share {{the costs and benefits of}} reducing future climate change (mitigation of climate change), or the costs and benefits of adapting to any future climate change (see also economics of global warming).|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of the AdS/CFT correspondence in late 1997 {{was the culmination of}} a long history <b>of</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> relate string theory to nuclear physics. In fact, string theory was originally developed during the late 1960s and early 1970s as a theory of hadrons, the subatomic particles like the proton and neutron that are held together by the strong nuclear force. The idea was that each of these particles could be viewed as a different oscillation mode of a string. In the late 1960s, experimentalists had found that hadrons fall into families called Regge trajectories with squared energy proportional to angular momentum, and theorists showed that this relationship emerges naturally from the physics of a rotating relativistic string.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the most}} {{satisfying}} moments in the Go series, the IGN and TouchArcade reviewers appreciated the game mechanic of determining how best to use a hack or drone to slip past enemies. The IGN reviewer found the game's puzzles somewhat harder than those of its predecessors, but was able to easily resolve them upon after taking brief breaks. The game's minimalism also led to some complications. Some of the solutions, he complained, were dependent on unintuitive player experimentation, such as realizing that the invisibility device {{also served as a}} projectile. Some of these visual cues were lost amidst the game's visual presentation. TouchArcade wondered whether the simplified environment was an aesthetic choice or the result <b>of</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> save on development costs. The GameSpot reviewer was disappointed to see an option for paid puzzle solutions in an otherwise short game about discovering the secret to a puzzle on one's own. Compared to the main series, in which the player may stake out a building at a distance, the experimentation in Deus Ex Go is limited to finding the right answer rather than finding multiple routes to solve the same problem.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} <b>of</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> control water {{resources}} in Florida and projects {{to drain the}} Everglades during the early and mid-20th century, water flow into Biscayne Bay has been altered by the construction of canals. These canals channel water from portions of the southeastern Everglades now used for agriculture into the bay. Prior to canal construction, most fresh water inflow came from rain and groundwater, but the canals are now altering the salinity profile of the bay, conveying sediment and pollutants and leading to saltwater intrusion into the Biscayne aquifer. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was established in 2000 to mitigate the effects of human intervention into the natural water flow of the Everglades. Primarily aimed at the restoration of historical patterns of water flow into Everglades National Park, the project will also deal with issues arising from the diversion of {{water out of the}} southern Everglades into Biscayne Bay. The Biscayne Bay Coastal Wetlands Project (BBCW) is a CERP component specifically intended to redistribute water flow so that fresh water is introduced gradually through creeks and marshes rather than short, heavy discharges through drainage canals.|$|E

Also in October 2011, the MTA announced a pilot program aimed at reducing levels of garbage in the subways by removing all garbage bins from the subway platforms. The initiative is being tested at the Eighth Street–New York University and Flushing–Main Street stations. As of March 2016, stations along the BMT Jamaica Line, BMT Myrtle Avenue Line, and various other stations had their garbage cans removed due {{to the success of}} the program.|$|E
5|$|Earlier historians, {{including}} Beale, {{believed that}} money drove events, {{and had seen}} Reconstruction as an economic struggle. They also accepted, for the most part, that reconciliation between North and South {{should have been the}} top priority of Reconstruction. In the 1950s, historians began to focus on the African-American experience as central to Reconstruction. They rejected completely any claim of black inferiority, which had marked many earlier historical works, and saw the developing Civil Rights Movement as a second Reconstruction; some writers stated they hoped their work on the postbellum era would advance the cause of civil rights. These authors sympathized with the Radical Republicans for their desire to help the African American, and saw Johnson as callous towards the freedman. In a number of works from 1956 onwards by such historians as Fawn Brodie, the former president was depicted as a successful saboteur <b>of</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> better the freedman's lot. These volumes included major biographies of Stevens and Stanton. Reconstruction was increasingly seen as a noble effort to integrate the freed slaves into society.|$|E
