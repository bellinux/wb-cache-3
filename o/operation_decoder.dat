In video decoding, the main challenges are the optimized partitioning of <b>decoder</b> <b>operations,</b> efficient tracking of dependencies and resource allocation/synchronization for multiple threads.

For low complexity encoding with superior compression performance, graph-based channel codes such as LDPC codes are used to generate the syndromes. The encoder performs simple XOR <b>operations,</b> while the <b>decoder</b> uses belief propagation (BP) decoding to recover the signal of interest using the syndromes and some correlated side information. We consider parallelization of BP decoding on general-purpose multi core CPUs. The motivation is to make BP decoding fast enough for realtime applications. We consider three different BP decoding algorithms: Sum-Product BP, Min-Sum BP and Algorithm E. The speedup obtained by parallelizing these algorithms is examined along with the tradeoff against decoding performance Parallelization is achieved by dividing the received syndrome vectors among different cores, and by using vector operations to simultaneously process multiple check nodes in each core. While Min-Sum BP has intermediate decoding complexity, a ”vectorized” version of Min-Sum BP performs nearly as fast as the much simpler Algorithm E with significantly fewer decoding errors.

40|$|Abstract- Variable length coding (VLC) is very {{suitable}} for regular data and efficient to compress data without any loss. VLC uses shorter bits of codewords instead of data occurring frequently, but uses the longer bits of codewords instead of data occurring infrequently. It {{is used in}} MPEG – 1 / 2 / 4 and H. 26 X (video and image compression standards). The entropy decoder in MPEG- 4 AVC/H. 264 baseline standard adopts Content Adaptive Variable Length Decoder (CAVLD). Because of symbol-to-symbol dependency, a traditional CAVLC decoder consumes lots of clock cycles in decoding and brings down the performance. We discover the decoding of two parameters spending almost eighty percent of computing time through profiling the computation of sub-modules and analyzing the encoding rules, which are non-zero coefficient (Level) and run_before. Thus this paper proposes a fast algorithm adapted for run_before decoder and the parallel architecture for level decoder, to improve the decoding performance. According to the features of these two methods, we name these two new methods as MLD (Multiple Level Decoding) and NZS (Non-Zero Skipping for run_before decoding).

40|$|In {{order to}} enhance {{performance}} {{and to support}} highly integrated functions, on-chip memory area has increased every technology generation. However, increased effect of parametric variations, susceptibility to soft errors, and increased leakage current in scaled technologies pose significant challenges {{in the design of}} low-power robust on-chip memory. In addition, there are application-specific design requirements. This research addresses the aforementioned issues related to on-chip memories to achieve robustness as well as optimality in terms of design requirements. ^ Soft errors are especially important in Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). In particular, soft errors in programming memory, leads to incorrect functionality in FPGAs. We present soft-error-tolerant FPGA operations using a new built-in 2 -dimensional Hamming product code. Next, we propose a wide-range Voltage-Frequency-Scaling (VFS) Viterbi decoder using a novel traceback memory. Considering memory access patterns specific to Viterbi traceback, along with low-voltage array design, highly energy-efficient Viterbi <b>decoder</b> <b>operation</b> with wide-range of VFS is achieved. For general purpose computing, we first focus on on-chip SRAM cache design for energy-efficient high-performance operation. We present a 1 R/ 1 W multi-port 8 T-SRAM array with column selection that enables supply-voltage-scalable set-associative caches with 1 R/ 1 W multi-port. The proposed technique addresses the limitation of a conventional 8 T SRAM in which column selection prevents multi-port operation and vice versa. Finally, we consider Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetic RAM (STT-MRAM) as an alternative to SRAMs for future processors. A detailed analysis of energy-efficiency, area, and performance in comparisons to SRAM caches is carried out. It is shown that STT-MRAM cache has significant energy and performance benefits in low level cache hierarchy. In order to address excessive write-energy requirement of STT-MRAM, we propose a new cache architecture performing partial-line-update. The proposed architecture provides significant write-energy reduction, which can potentially make STT-MRAM suitable for on-chip caches. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{prototype}} decoder for a serially concatenated pulse position modulation (SCPPM) code {{has been}} implemented in a {{field-programmable gate array}} (FPGA). At {{the time of this}} reporting, this is the first known hardware SCPPM decoder. The SCPPM coding scheme, conceived for free-space optical communications with both deep-space and terrestrial applications in mind, is an improvement of several dB over the conventional Reed-Solomon PPM scheme. The design of the FPGA SCPPM decoder is based on a turbo decoding algorithm that requires relatively low computational complexity while delivering error-rate performance within approximately 1 dB of channel capacity. The SCPPM encoder consists of an outer convolutional encoder, an interleaver, an accumulator, and an inner modulation encoder (more precisely, a mapping of bits to PPM symbols). Each code is describable by a trellis (a finite directed graph). The SCPPM decoder consists of an inner soft-in-soft-out (SISO) module, a de-interleaver, an outer SISO module, and an interleaver connected in a loop (see figure). Each SISO module applies the Bahl-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv (BCJR) algorithm to compute a-posteriori bit log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) from apriori LLRs by traversing the code trellis in forward and backward directions. The SISO modules iteratively refine the LLRs by passing the estimates between one another much like the working of a turbine engine. Extrinsic information (the difference between the a-posteriori and a-priori LLRs) is exchanged rather than the a-posteriori LLRs to minimize undesired feedback. All computations are performed in the logarithmic domain, wherein multiplications are translated into additions, thereby reducing complexity and sensitivity to fixed-point implementation roundoff errors. To lower the required memory for storing channel likelihood data and the amounts of data transfer between the decoder and the receiver, one can discard the majority of channel likelihoods, using only the remainder in <b>operation</b> of the <b>decoder.</b> This is accomplished in the receiver by transmitting only a subset consisting of the likelihoods that correspond to time slots containing the largest numbers of observed photons during each PPM symbol period. The assumed number of observed photons in the remaining time slots is set to the mean of a noise slot. In low background noise, the selection of a small subset in this manner results in only negligible loss. Other features of the decoder design to reduce complexity and increase speed include (1) quantization of metrics in an efficient procedure chosen to incur no more than a small performance loss and (2) the use of the max-star function that allows sum of exponentials to be computed by simple operations that involve only an addition, a subtraction, and a table lookup. Another prominent feature of the design is a provision for access to interleaver and de-interleaver memory in a single clock cycle, eliminating the multiple clock-cycle latency characteristic of prior interleaver and de-interleaver designs...|$|R
