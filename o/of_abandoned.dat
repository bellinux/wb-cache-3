25|$|The matter {{became a}} scandal in French {{politics}} and Bourbons officials {{tried to cover}} it up. At his court martial at Port de Rochefort in 1817 Chaumareys was tried on five counts but acquitted <b>of</b> <b>abandoning</b> his squadron, <b>of</b> failing to re-float his ship and <b>of</b> <b>abandoning</b> the raft. However he {{was found guilty of}} incompetent and complacent navigation and <b>of</b> <b>abandoning</b> the Méduse before all her passengers had been taken off. Even though this verdict exposed him to the death penalty, Chaumareys was sentenced to only three years in jail.|$|R

5|$|As of {{the early}} 2000s, the Theta Company owns some tracts {{of land in the}} {{watershed}} of Leggetts Creek. These include areas around the Griffin Reservoir and Maple Lake. Some property along the creek's floodplain is owned by the city of Scranton. Additionally, there are parcels <b>of</b> <b>abandoned</b> mine lands {{in the vicinity of the}} creek in northern Scranton. These parcels may be developed by the 2020s. The major neighborhoods in the watershed include historic residential neighborhoods that were developed between 1870 and 1920.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan {{recommended}} that Ransom Township, Newton Township, {{and the city}} of Scranton include protection of Keyser Creek in their comprehensive plans, as well as their ordinances for land use, zoning, and subdivision. The creek is on the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection Bureau <b>of</b> <b>Abandoned</b> Mine Reclamation's priority list and the Lackawanna River Corridor Association's priority list for the Lackawanna River watershed.|$|E

5|$|Plunketts Creek {{has been}} a place for lumber and tourism since its villages were founded, and as {{industry}} declined, nature recovered. Second growth forests have since covered most of the clear-cut land. Pennsylvania's state legislature authorized the acquisition <b>of</b> <b>abandoned</b> and clear-cut land for Pennsylvania State Game Lands in 1919, and the Pennsylvania Game Commission (PGC) acquired property along Plunketts Creek for State Game Lands Number 134 between 1937 and 1945. The main entrance to State Game Lands 134 is {{just north of the}} bridge site, {{on the east side of}} the creek.|$|E
5|$|San Francisco {{had been}} a tiny {{settlement}} before the rush began. When residents learned about the discovery, it at first became a ghost town <b>of</b> <b>abandoned</b> ships and businesses, but then boomed as merchants and new people arrived. The population of San Francisco exploded from perhaps about 1,000 in 1848 to 25,000 full-time residents by 1850. Miners lived in tents, wood shanties, or deck cabins removed from abandoned ships.|$|E
5|$|Spring Brook {{has been}} studied several times. It was studied by the United States Geological Survey from 1971 to 1975, by Daniels (working for the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission) in 1976, by Rider and Blacksmith (working for the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection) in 1985, by Copeland (working for the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission) in 1992, by Moase (working for the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission) in 1993, and Popp and McGurl in 2003. The stream is on the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection Bureau <b>of</b> <b>Abandoned</b> Mine Restoration's {{priority}} list for restoration.|$|E

But they found the heat excessive and returned.|$|E
5|$|The Purton Hulks or Purton Ships' Graveyard is {{a number}} <b>of</b> <b>abandoned</b> boats and ships, {{deliberately}} beached beside the River Severn near Purton in Gloucestershire, England, to reinforce the river banks. Most were beached in the 1950s and {{are now in a}} state of considerable decay. The site forms the largest ship graveyard in mainland Britain.|$|E
5|$|The cave {{was formed}} under phreatic {{conditions}} i.e. below the local water table, but lowering base levels {{to which the}} subterranean drainage was flowing resulted in some passages being abandoned by the river, and {{there is evidence of}} a number <b>of</b> <b>abandoned</b> resurgences. In particular, the passages in the 20th chamber are interpreted as a former Vauclusian spring, the waters of which once surfaced in the Ebbor Gorge. It is uncertain whether that was the original rising or whether it formed when the main rising at Wookey was blocked.|$|E

5|$|While {{this action}} was in {{progress}} near Yonil Airfield, the week-long battle for Hill 300 north of Kyongju {{came to an}} end. A regiment of the ROK 3rd Division captured the hill on September 11. In midafternoon the 3rd Battalion, US 19th Infantry, relieved the South Korean troops there. Scattered over Hill 300 lay 257 counted North Korean dead and great quantities <b>of</b> <b>abandoned</b> equipment and weapons, some of it American. In this fighting for Hill 300, the US 3rd Battalion, 19th Infantry, 37 men killed.|$|E
5|$|Along a highway, {{the group}} is forced to stop as a number <b>of</b> <b>abandoned</b> cars litter the road, making it {{impossible}} to pass; further, Dale (Jeffrey DeMunn) must stop to fix his RV. As the others push cars {{out of the way and}} scavenge for supplies, a horde of walkers appear behind them. The group take shelter under cars to avoid conflict, though in his haste, T-Dog (IronE Singleton) severely cuts his arm. Some walkers spot Sophia (Madison Lintz), daughter of Carol Peletier (Melissa McBride), hiding under a car, and she flees into the nearby forest. Rick follows her and tells her to find someplace safe to hide while he dispatches the walkers.|$|E
5|$|Conservation of A.viridimontanum is {{primarily}} limited by its restricted habitat on serpentine cliffs and talus slopes. However, these sites are also of little value to humans. The most likely {{threat to the}} species is expansion of asbestos mining, which often occurs near populations of the fern, or other reuse <b>of</b> <b>abandoned</b> asbestos mines. Road construction might also threaten some sites, although this is mitigated by the fern's ability to flourish on disturbed serpentine. None of the sites are as yet known to be invaded by non-native plants. The species is considered more difficult to cultivate than either of its parent species.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1970s, studies {{indicated}} that active treatment {{would be the}} most suitable remedy for abandoned mine drainage in the watershed of Nanticoke Creek, with hydrated lime being proposed as one possible treatment method. However, some small scale passive treatment has been attempted in the watershed. A 2008 paper estimated that the Nanticoke Creek Assessment and Restoration Project would cost $5,000,000. An active treatment project by the Earth Conservancy began in 2012, with the intent to repair damage caused by the Askam Borehole. The Bureau <b>of</b> <b>Abandoned</b> Mine Reclamation of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection has a permit to discharge stormwater into the creek during earth-moving activities involving filling in dangerous strip pits.|$|E
5|$|Lismore, {{like other}} Hebridean islands, has {{suffered}} from depopulation since the 19th century, in large {{part due to the}} Clearances. In 1798 there were 900 people living on the island and 1399 by 1841. Over the next 40 years the population more than halved to 621. By 1961 there were only 155 residents, and {{by the time of the}} 1991 census there were just 140. There are various examples <b>of</b> <b>abandoned</b> townships, such as Coille nam Bard on the east coast. In the 2001 census, the population had risen slightly to 146, over 45% of whom were over 60 years old, making it the Scottish island with the oldest population.|$|E
5|$|On {{the crest}} of Sibidang-san, an antipersonnel {{minefield}} stopped the first North Korean infantry assault. More attacks followed in quick succession, {{all of which were}} repulsed by the US troops' superior firepower. By 02:30 the B Company riflemen were so depleted of ammunition that they began stripping machine-gun bullets from the ammunition belts and using them in their rifles. The 1st Platoon of C Company, {{at the base of the}} mountain behind B Company, climbed Sibidang-san in 45 minutes with an ammunition resupply for the company. Just before dawn the North Korean attack subsided. Daylight revealed a vast amount <b>of</b> <b>abandoned</b> North Korean equipment scattered on the slope just below the crest, including 33 machine-guns. Among the North Korean dead was the commanding officer of the NK 13th Regiment.|$|E
