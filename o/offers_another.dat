5|$|In early 2006, Sony {{released}} {{a remake of}} Lemmings for the PlayStation Portable, developed by Team17. It features all 120 levels from the original game, 36 brand-new levels as well as DataPack support (similar to the Extra Track system featured in Wipeout Pure), and a user-level editor. Every level in the game is a pre-rendered 3D landscape, although their gameplay is still 2D and remains faithful to the original game. User levels can be constructed from pre-rendered objects and distributed by uploading them to a PlayStation-specific Lemmings online community. The soundtrack also marks the final video game score created by longtime composer Tim Follin after he announced his retirement from the industry in mid-2005. In October 2006 the game was ported by developer Rusty Nutz for the PlayStation 2 with use of the EyeToy. The basic change in the concept is that the player must stretch and use his/her limbs in the recorded picture to aid the lemmings. In 2007, Team17 produced a similar remake of Lemmings for the PlayStation 3 for download through the PlayStation Network. The game has the similar graphical improvements as the PSP title, as well as on-line scoreboards and additional levels developed for high-definition display, but lacks {{the ability to create}} and share levels as the PSP version <b>offers.</b> <b>Another</b> remake, Lemmings Touch, was released for PlayStation Vita on 27 May 2014, developed by d3t Ltd.|$|E

25|$|Asianist Kenneth Chase <b>offers</b> <b>another</b> {{theory as}} to why gun {{development}} stagnated during the Ming dynasty. Chase argues that guns were not particularly useful against China's traditional enemies: horse nomads. Guns were supposedly problematic to deploy against nomads because of their size and slow speed, drawing out supply chains, and creating logistical challenges. Theoretically, the more mobile nomads took the initiative in sallying, retreating, and engaging at will. Chinese armies therefore relied less heavily on guns in warfare than Europeans, who fought large infantry battles and sieges which favored guns, or so Chase argues.|$|E
25|$|VLC {{media player}} can play high {{definition}} recordings of D-VHS tapes duplicated {{to a computer}} using CapDVHS.exe. This <b>offers</b> <b>another</b> way to archive all D-VHS tapes with the DRM copy freely tag. Using a FireWire connection from cable boxes to computers, VLC can stream live, unencrypted content to a monitor or HDTV. VLC media player can display the playing video as the desktop wallpaper, like Windows DreamScene, by using DirectX, only available on Windows operating systems. VLC media player can create screencasts and record the desktop. On Microsoft Windows, VLC also supports the Direct Media Object (DMO) framework and can thus make use of some third-party DLLs (Dynamic-link library). On most platforms, VLC can tune into and view DVB-C, DVB-T, and DVB-S channels. On macOS the separate EyeTV plugin is required, on Windows it requires the card's BDA Drivers.|$|E
25|$|The genetic {{diversity}} of HIV presents an enormous challenge for researchers. And, because {{the virus has}} the ability to evade neutralizing antibodies produced by natural immunity, the standard vaccine strategy of mimicking natural infection to induce antibodies has so far proved impossible. Strengthening cell-mediated immunity <b>offers</b> <b>another</b> possible route to success. About 90% of candidate HIV vaccines in development use this approach. These products will not prevent infection. But it is hoped that they will lower viral load and therefore progression to AIDS and secondary transmissions. Some observers believe that a vaccine to prevent HIV will never be achieved. Ultimately, even if an HIV preventive vaccine were to be developed, they are unlikely to be 100% effective. It has come to be realised that no single approach alone will be able to stem the spread of HIV. The future of HIV prevention will most likely involve combining new methods with existing approaches, such as condom use.|$|E

500|$|In 614, Justus {{attended}} the Council of Paris, {{held by the}} Frankish king, Chlothar II. It is unclear why Justus and Peter, the abbot of Sts Peter and Paul in Canterbury, were present. [...] It may have been just chance, but historian James Campbell has suggested that Chlothar summoned clergy from Britain to attend {{in an attempt to}} assert overlordship over Kent. The historian N. J. Higham <b>offers</b> <b>another</b> explanation for their attendance, arguing that Æthelberht sent the pair to the council because of shifts in Frankish policy towards the Kentish kingdom, which threatened Kentish independence, and that the two clergymen were sent to negotiate a compromise with Chlothar.|$|E
500|$|The {{reception}} of Aradia amongst Neopagans {{has not been}} entirely positive. Clifton suggests that modern claims of revealing an Italian pagan witchcraft tradition, for example those of Leo Martello and Raven Grimassi, must be [...] "match against", and compared with the claims in Aradia. He further suggests {{that a lack of}} comfort with Aradia may be due to an [...] "insecurity" [...] within Neopaganism about the movement's claim to authenticity as a religious revival. Valiente <b>offers</b> <b>another</b> explanation for the negative reaction of some neopagans; that the identification of Lucifer as the God of the witches in Aradia was [...] "too strong meat" [...] for Wiccans who were used to the gentler, romantic paganism of Gerald Gardner and were especially quick to reject any relationship between witchcraft and Satanism.|$|E
500|$|Gaming-related comedy <b>offers</b> <b>another</b> {{possible}} {{entry point}} for new machinima producers. Presented as five-minute sketches, many machinima comedies are analogous to Internet Flash animations. After Clan Undead's 1997 work Operation Bayshield {{built on the}} earliest Quake movies by introducing narrative conventions of linear media and sketch comedy reminiscent of the television show Saturday Night Live, the New-York-based ILL Clan further developed the genre in machinima through works including Apartment Huntin' and Hardly Workin'. Red vs. Blue: The Blood Gulch Chronicles chronicles a futile civil war over five seasons and 100 episodes. Marino wrote that although the series' humor was rooted in video games, strong writing and characters caused the series to [...] "transcend the typical gamer". An example of a comedy film that targets a more general audience is Strange Company's Tum Raider, produced for the BBC in 2004.|$|E

500|$|The exact {{location}} of the Hutchinson house {{has been a source}} of great interest for several centuries. [...] LaPlante hints in her biography of Hutchinson that the homestead was near the Indian Trail that went through modern-day Pelham Bay Park, on the east side of the Hutchinson River. Lockwood Barr <b>offers</b> <b>another</b> hypothesis, citing the extensive land title research of Otto Hufeland published by the Westchester Historical Society in 1929. He concluded that the site of the homestead was on the west side of the Hutchinson River in Eastchester. A map in Barr's book that appeared in the 1929 work shows the property bordering the river in an area that is now called Baychester, between two creeks called Rattlesnake Brook and Black Dog Brook. [...] This area of the Bronx is now highly developed; Rattlesnake Brook is extant, mostly in underground culverts, but Black Dog Brook is defunct.|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} broadcast, [...] "Colonel Homer" [...] finished 22nd {{in the ratings}} for the week of March 23–29, 1992, with a Nielsen rating of 14.8, equivalent to approximately 16.63 million viewing households. It was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed gave the episode a 5/5 rating and called it [...] "another great" [...] episode that chronicles the love between Homer and Marge, showing the [...] "ups and downs" [...] of their marriage. He said Lurleen's songs are [...] "filled with clever observations", but it is Homer's befuddlement {{that makes it a}} [...] "classic" [...] episode. Meyers added, however, that country music fans might [...] "take offense at Matt Groening's script, which hams up every stereotype imaginable". DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said that after the [...] "great" [...] previous episode [...] "Dog of Death", [...] "one might expect some drop-off with 'Colonel Homer', but virtually none occurs. It <b>offers</b> <b>another</b> classic episode that benefits from a memorable guest voice performance from D’Angelo. Homer’s moment in the sun creates a fun plot and the program nicely lampoons the country music business." [...] The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said the episode is a [...] "good example of The Simpsons fixing itself on a target (in this case, country and western music) and extracting every possible gag. Lurleen's songs are all marvelous." ...|$|E

These probability amplitudes can be represented as a complex number or equivalent vector—or, as Richard Feynman simply calls them in his book on QED, [...] "arrows".|$|E
2500|$|Lee <b>offers</b> <b>another</b> {{reason for}} the American defeat at Hobkirk's Hill, {{suggesting}} that Greene's order to the Cavalry under Williams to circle around the British and attack them in the rear was a plausible explanation for the loss. [...] As explained in his memoirs, if the Cavalry had been held in reserve, rather than order to attack {{the rear of the}} British force where they were held up by Rowsan's baggage train, William's troops could have been used to reinforce the line and reversing the gains made by the British reserve that had already been committed to the battle.|$|E
