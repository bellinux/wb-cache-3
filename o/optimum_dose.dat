50|$|The {{treatment}} options for hypohidrosis and anhidrosis is limited. Those with hypohidrosis should avoid drugs that can aggravate the condition (see medication-causes).

In instances where the cause is known, treatment should be directed at the primary pathology. In autoimmune diseases, such as Sjogren syndrome and systemic sclerosis, treatment of the underlying disease using immunosuppressive drugs may lead to improvement in hypohidrosis. In neurological diseases, the primary pathology is often irreversible.

40|$|Background: Oncologists {{are trained}} {{to make the best}} use of all {{available}} modes of therapy for patients with cancer. Our current armamentarium of cytotoxic drugs is, however, far from ideal, resulting in therapeutic failure in some of the common solid tumours. To make the best use of available drugs, <b>optimum</b> <b>doses,</b> schedules and routes of administra-tion should be used for each individual patient and disease state. Existing drugs: Traditional methods of drug develop-ment have produced some active anticancer drugs, though the inflexibility and empiricism evident in the early-phase clinical trials of some drugs has seriously delayed the defi-nition of <b>optimum</b> <b>doses,</b> schedules and routes of admin-istration. This is illustrated by the anticancer agents, eto-poside and 5 -fiuorouracil, both of which are still not used optimally, despite more than 20 years of clinical investiga-tion. New drugs: It could be argued that these drugs were de-veloped prior to our improved understanding of drug ac-tions, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and that such problems do not arise with new agents today. However, examples of the camptothecin derivatives (topotecan and CPT-II) show that we have progressed, but that we {{still have a long way}} to travel. This paper highlights the problems in-herent in the development of new anticancer drugs. Strat-egies for avoiding these problems include: adoption of bio-logical endpoints for phase I studies; the use of modern pharmacokinetic techniques to develop pharmacodynamic models; adaptive control of drug dosing...|$|R

40|$|The {{environmental}} impact of pentachlorophenol (PCP) {{has been the subject}} of extensive research in recent years. Investigations of PCP degradation using both biotic and abiotic methods are extensively reported in literature. Based on some preliminary tests (not shown), an abiotic method was found for oxidative PCP degradation in soil under unsaturated conditions and a neutral pH. Reagents used were heme (a catalyst) and peroxide (an oxidant). From two screening tests (not shown), the heme and peroxide were identified as the most important factors on PCP degradation in highly PCP-contaminated soil. The objective of this study was to determine the <b>optimum</b> <b>doses</b> of heme and peroxide for PCP degradation in soil. Using a statistical method, known as response surface methodology, a quadratic function was fit to the data and used to estimate the <b>optimum</b> <b>doses</b> of heme and peroxide at 0. 035 g∕ 2 g 0. 035 g∕ 2 g -soil and 0. 105 g∕ 2 g 0. 105 g∕ 2 g -soil, respectively, in treating PCP-contaminated soil. The model also was used to determine the region in which the response was within the 95 % confidence region of the optimum. The lowest heme and peroxide doses required to achieve a response within the 95 % confidence region of the optimum were found to be 0. 017 g∕ 2 g 0. 017 g∕ 2 g -soil and 0. 095 g∕ 2 g 0. 095 g∕ 2 g -soil, respectively.
