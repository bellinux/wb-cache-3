5|$|From the 16th century, the landowners {{were the}} Carre family, who {{operated}} tight {{control over the}} town, and it grew little in the early modern period. The manor passed from the Carre family to the Hervey family by the marriage of Isabella Carre to John Hervey, 1st Earl of Bristol, in 1688. The town's common land and fields were legally enclosed by 1794, giving ownership mostly to the Hervey family; this coincided with making the Slea into a canal, and heralded the first steps towards modern industry. The Sleaford Navigation brought economic growth until it was superseded by the railways in the mid-1850s. In the 20th century, the sale of farmland around Sleaford by Bristol Estates {{led to the development}} of large housing estates. The subsequent availability <b>of</b> <b>affordable</b> <b>housing</b> combined with the town's educational facilities and low crime rates made it an attractive destination for home-buyers. As a result, the town's population underwent the fastest growth of any town in the county in the 1990s.|$|E

25|$|In his After the Fact (1995) study, the {{anthropologist}} Clifford Geertz documented {{changes in a}} city in Morocco. As poor rural migrants moved into the center city during urbanization, the older, more established and wealthier populations moved to the outskirts. This pattern of class and education succession has been seen in United States cities, where poor immigrants and migrants have occupied older areas <b>of</b> <b>affordable</b> <b>housing,</b> but when economically established, they move to better areas, often in the suburbs.

25|$|The modern village {{retains the}} {{character}} of its Victorian and Edwardian boom. Kilmacolm railway station was closed in 1983, and the track converted into a recreational cycle path.

Expansion into green belt land is now discouraged and, combined with a high demand for housing, this has led to an identified shortage <b>of</b> <b>affordable</b> <b>housing</b> in the village.|$|E
