40|$|Text signage as visual {{indicators}} {{in natural}} scene {{plays an important}} role in navigation and notification in our daily life. Most previous methods <b>of</b> <b>scene</b> text extraction are developed from a single scene image. In this paper, we propose a multi-frame based scene text recognition method by tracking text regions in a video captured by a moving camera. The main contributions of this paper are as follows. First, we present a framework <b>of</b> <b>scene</b> text recognition in multiple frames based on feature representation <b>of</b> <b>scene</b> text character (STC) for character prediction and conditional random field (CRF) model for word configuration. Second, a feature representation of STC is employed from dense sampled SIFT descriptors and Fisher Vector. Third, we collect a dataset for text information extraction from natural scene videos. Our proposed multi-frame scene text recognition is more compatible with image/video-based mobile applications. The experimental results demonstrate that STC prediction and word configuration in multiple frames based on text tracking significantly improves the performance <b>of</b> <b>scene</b> text recognition.

5|$|A {{very similar}} archway {{is found in}} Dieric Bouts's c. 1445 Mary Altarpiece, {{including}} spandrels with warriors. Art historians are unsure which was painted earlier– Christus's Nativity or Bouts's altarpiece. Equally, van der Weyden's arched triptychs were executed {{at roughly the same}} period, but art historians are more certain Rogier's archivolt design set the precedent. Unlike Bouts and van der Weyden, Christus appears to have used the device to encompass a single scene, incorporating all the main characters within the arch, instead of a linked series <b>of</b> <b>scenes</b> with separate archways.|$|E

5|$|Not {{long after}} the changes to the ride in 1990, the special effects began to {{deteriorate}} {{due to a lack}} of upkeep.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new approach, based on {{information}} theory, to study the visibility <b>of</b> a <b>scene.</b> Thus, we will define the concepts of entropy and mutual information applied to 3 D scene visibility.

The depiction has also been theorized as a metaphor for Jesus's defeat of Satan.|$|E

5|$|As {{a visual}} novel, School Days {{contains}} extremely minimal gameplay. The game's core onscreen presentation is composed <b>of</b> <b>scenes</b> that {{are viewed from}} a mostly third-person perspective. At predetermined intervals, the game pauses, and players are presented with one to two responses or actions relevant to the scene in progress to make, or not make, on behalf of characters. Each selection branches the game's progress {{up to that point}} in an alternate direction, while also causing the player's love toward a character to blossom, plateau, or diminish, thus providing for a nonlinear storytelling experience. Being an erotic title, relationships between characters may become sexual; scenes of this kind depict a varying combination of French kissing, masturbation, oral sex and intercourse. Genitalia are pixelated in the original Japanese releases, but the Western release of School Days HQ is uncensored. Sex scenes are omitted from the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable ports of the game.|$|E
5|$|As {{the player}} makes choices {{throughout}} the game, the gameplay's plot is revealed. Besides affecting dialogue and story developments, {{the outcome of}} entire scenes (and in some cases, the outcome <b>of</b> <b>scenes</b> several chapters later) can be manipulated {{to a certain extent}} based on player choices. These choices are typically moral decisions made through Jodie's dialogue options, interventions with various characters, success or failure in her combat scenes, or psychic actions that the player chooses to have Aiden perform. Examples of choice-based outcomes are the chapter titled The Party, where the player is given the choice of unleashing brutal revenge toward a group of bullies or simply running away, and the chapter titled The Embassy, where the player can either engage in psychic information retrieval or can jeopardize the mission by forcing one of the guards to commit suicide. Choices also determine the finale of Beyond: Two Souls, as any number of possible plot endings can be experienced by the player.|$|E
5|$|Composer Tyler Bates began scoring Watchmen in November 2007. He {{planned to}} visit the shoot for a week during each month, and view {{assembly}} cuts <b>of</b> <b>scenes</b> to begin rough composing. Snyder and Bates listened to the soundtracks of 1980s films such as Manhunter, Blade Runner, and To Live and Die in L.A. for inspiration. Bates switched between a Yamaha CS-80 or an MOTM for moments that he felt should have more ambience or synthesizers. Snyder wanted a scene where Nite Owl and Silk Spectre rescue people from a burning building {{to have a more}} traditional superhero feel, so Bates implemented a four to the floor guitar rhythm. A 64-strong choir and the 87-piece ensemble from the Hollywood Studio Symphony were hired for the more orchestral themes.|$|E

5|$|Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade is a {{tactical}} role-playing game where players take {{the role of}} story protagonists Lyn, Eliwood, and Hector as they navigate story-driven missions across the fictional continent of Elibe. The player takes {{the role of an}} unseen tactician directing the player army. The single-player campaign is divided into chapters which generally begin with story elements presented through the use <b>of</b> <b>scenes</b> animated with still images of the main characters, then followed by a battle with an enemy; after each battle, the player is given the opportunity to save their progress. In-game currency is gained either through battles in the game's Link Arena or through other means, rather than from defeating units. Currency can be used to buy new items and weapons at merchants in between battles and at specific locations within maps. Items can also be exchanged between units during battles.|$|E

Despite this realism, a number of minor errors were made in Hergé's depiction of Geneva.|$|E
40|$|The concept <b>of</b> <b>scene</b> has {{now become}} a primary {{conceptual}} framework in studying the production and consumption of popular music. In his formative essay on scenes, Straw (1991) offered the important observation that, through its ability to transcend community, scene could simultaneously be theorised as a local and trans-local phenomenon. More recently, Peterson and Bennett (2004) have added a new dimension to this conceptualisation <b>of</b> <b>scene</b> through positing virtuality as a further medium for scene involvement. However, missing from each element of this tripartite model <b>of</b> <b>scene</b> - local, trans-local, and virtual -is any consideration <b>of</b> how music <b>scenes</b> are enacted through the process of embodiment. In this paper, we argue that the process of embodiment is critically important for how music scenes are constructed, enacted and maintained by participants. The corporal element <b>of</b> <b>scene</b> introduced through its embodiment by social actors, we argue, is a key element for our understanding <b>of</b> the music <b>scene</b> as an anchoring place within everyday urban, regional and, increasingly, rural landscapes.
