25|$|America {{will need}} to forge a {{partnership}} between our civilians and <b>our</b> <b>military.</b> We are urging Congress to meet the President’s request to {{double the number of}} our positions for political advisers to military forces, diplomats who can work not only with four-star generals, but also deploy as civilian experts to Navy SEAL teams and to North Africa.|$|E

25|$|When the Second Boer War {{broke out}} in South Africa in October 1899, a Liberal MP, Leonard Courtney, invited Hobhouse to become {{secretary}} of the women's branch of the South African Conciliation Committee, {{of which he was}} president. She wrote It was late in the summer of 1900 that I first learnt of the hundreds of Boer women that became impoverished and were left ragged by <b>our</b> <b>military</b> operations… the poor women who were being driven from pillar to post, needed protection and organized assistance.|$|E
25|$|According to Tacitus, {{the region}} was {{originally}} populated by the Celtic tribe of the Helvetii, but soon Germanic and Gaulish settlers arrived. Tacitus writes that: I should not reckon among the German tribes the cultivators of the tithe-lands , although they are settled on the further side of the Rhine and Danube. Reckless adventurers from Gaul, emboldened by want, occupied this land of questionable ownership. After a while, our frontier having been advanced, and <b>our</b> <b>military</b> positions pushed forward, it {{was regarded as a}} remote nook of our empire and a part of a Roman province.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} murders and assaults perpetrated upon Negroes is very great; we can form only an approximative {{estimate}} {{of what is}} going on in those parts of the South which are not closely garrisoned, and from which no regular reports are received, by what occurs under the very eyes of <b>our</b> <b>military</b> authorities. As to my personal experience, I will only mention that during my two days sojourn at Atlanta, one Negro was stabbed with fatal effect on the street, and three were poisoned, one of whom died. While I was at Montgomery, one negro was cut across the throat evidently with intent to kill, and another was shot, but both escaped with their lives. Several papers attached to this report give an account of the number of capital cases that occurred at certain places during a certain period of time. It is a sad fact that the perpetration of those acts is not confined to that class of people which might be called the rabble.|$|E
2500|$|Horses and bayonets - After Romney said in {{the third}} presidential debate that the U.S. Navy was smaller {{than at any time}} since 1917, Obama replied, [...] "We have fewer ships than we did in 1916.

5000|$|Despite her {{amendment}} to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 was rejected in a 209-214 vote, {{and she did not}} speak with President Trump directly, the president announced via Twitter on July 26, 2017 that he would ban transgender people to serve in U.S. military. She was [...] "very pleased that he listened and he acted decisively and will help restore <b>our</b> <b>military’s</b> readiness.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Laurie Hawn, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence, {{stated that}} they {{expected}} a purchase price to be between $70 and 75 million each, based on conversations with other customers. He defended the 20-year budget figure and said [...] "It really is the best airplane for the best price with the best benefit to Canadian industry to serve <b>our</b> <b>military's</b> needs for the next 40 years".|$|R
500|$|One US {{official}} said NATO forces had informed the Pakistani army's 11th Corps command near the western border that operations against Taliban insurgents {{would take place}} on that day.

500|$|At a 1998 {{reunion of}} Missouri veterans, {{many of those}} present who had served during World War II felt that, on reflection, their captain had acted correctly. Robert Kihune, a retired US Navy vice admiral, said, [...] "In wartime, courage is {{measured}} as much by one's actions as their strength of leadership during the heat of battle ... I think the leadership qualities showed by Captain Callaghan illustrate the ideal of what we want <b>our</b> <b>military</b> leaders to follow." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN {{commented that}} the {{portrayal}} of [...] "service in the military is a hilarious satire of {{the current state of}} <b>our</b> <b>military</b> in Iraq".

Brett Love of TV Squad noted that [...] "The Full Metal Jacket/Stripes angle for Stewie and Brian was great, right down to the Stripes music during the obstacle course. And Louis Gossett, Jr. as Sergeant Angryman is a nice bit of casting." ...|$|E

Such an open process ensures Canadians get the best price, the military gets what it needs and Canadian industries get the best spin-offs; We will review the proposed F-35 purchase {{as part of the}} Defence White Paper.|$|R
500|$|In {{an opinion}} piece for Foreign Policy, Max Boot {{outlines}} his views thusly: [...] "I am socially liberal: I am pro-LGBTQ rights, pro-abortion rights, pro-immigration. I am fiscally conservative: I {{think we need}} to reduce the deficit and get entitlement spending under control. I am pro-environment: I think that climate change is a major threat that we need to address. I am pro-free trade: I think we should be concluding new trade treaties rather than pulling out of old ones. I am strong on defense: I {{think we need to}} beef up <b>our</b> <b>military</b> to cope with multiple enemies. And I am very much in favor of America acting as a world leader: I believe it is in our own self-interest to promote and defend freedom and free markets as we have been doing {{in one form or another}} since at least 1898." ...|$|E
500|$|On April 14, 2017, Biden {{released}} a statement both denouncing Chechnya authorities for their rounding, torturing, and murdering of [...] "individuals who {{are believed to be}} gay" [...] and stating his hope that the Trump administration honor a prior pledge to advance human rights by confronting Russian leaders over [...] "these egregious violations of human rights." [...] June 21, during a speech at a Democratic National Committee LGBT gala in New York City, in reference to President Trump's campaign promise to protect the LGBT community, Biden said, [...] "Hold President Trump accountable for his pledge to be your friend." [...] On July 26, after President Trump announced a ban of transgender people serving in the military, Biden tweeted, [...] "Every patriotic American who is qualified to serve in <b>our</b> <b>military</b> should be able to serve.

500|$|In September 2007 Clark's memoir A Time to Lead: For Duty, Honor and Country.

He had made the allegation a number of times in public and media appearances in 2006 and 2007. The book also described a conversation Clark had with Paul Wolfowitz in May 1991 after the Gulf War, quoting Wolfowitz as lamenting the non-removal of Saddam Hussein, but also telling him that [...] "...we did learn one thing that’s very important. With the end of the Cold War, we can now use <b>our</b> <b>military</b> with impunity. The Soviets won’t come in to block us. And we’ve got five, maybe 10, years to clean up these old Soviet surrogate regimes like Iraq and Syria before the next superpower emerges to challenge us...".|$|E
5000|$|On 21 September, visiting U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said Royal New Zealand Navy ships {{would be}} allowed onto Defence Department or Coast guard {{facilities}} both within the U.S. {{and elsewhere in the}} world.

500|$|The Foreign Office, meanwhile, was {{determined}} not to back down {{in the face of what}} was seen as a further affront to British prestige and a challenge. Thorneycroft argued that if the Victorious did not pass through the Straits on her return journey, Britain [...] "should suffer a substantial political defeat with unpredictable effects on <b>our</b> <b>military</b> position in the Far East," [...] and was supported in this view by Admiral Mountbatten and David Luce, First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff. Mountbatten went even further, warning Thorneycroft that a failure to meet the challenge would have [...] "serious repercussions" [...] on Britain's [...] "whole military stature, not only in the Far East but worldwide." [...] Luce and Mountbatten also thought this the perfect opportunity to put pressure on Jakarta for the first time, Luce stating that the return passage [...] "might pass the initiative to us" [...] and Mountbatten seeing it as an opportune moment to divert Sukarno from his Malaysian raiding. At the very least, innocent passage through the Strait had to be defended.|$|E
500|$|Cameron {{said that}} Americans have a [...] "moral responsibility" [...] to {{understand}} {{the impact of their}} country's recent military campaigns. [...] Commenting on the term [...] "shock and awe" [...] in the film, Cameron said: [...] "We {{know what it feels like}} to launch the missiles. [...] We don't know what it feels like for them to land on our home soil, not in America." [...] Christian Hamaker of Crosswalk.com noted that, [...] "in describing the military assault on Pandora, Cameron cribs terminology from the ongoing war on terrorism and puts it in the mouths of the film's villains... as they 'fight terror with terror'. Cameron's sympathies, and the movie's, clearly are with the Na'vi—and against the military and corporate men." [...] A columnist in the Russian newspaper Vedomosti traced Avatars popularity to its giving the audience a chance to make a moral choice between good and evil and, by emotionally siding with Jake's treason, to relieve [...] "us the scoundrels" [...] of our collective guilt for the cruel and unjust world that we have created. Armond White of New York Press dismissed the film as [...] "essentially a sentimental cartoon with a pacifist, naturalist message" [...] that uses villainous Americans to misrepresent the facts of the military, capitalism, and imperialism. [...] Answering critiques of the film as insulting to the U.S. military, a piece in the Los Angeles Times asserted that [...] "if any U.S. forces that ever existed were being insulted, it was the ones who fought under George Armstrong Custer, not David Petraeus or Stanley McChrystal." [...] Other reviews saw Avatar as [...] "the bubbling up of <b>our</b> <b>military</b> subconscious... the wish to be free of all the paperwork and risk aversion of the modern Army—much more fun to fly, unarmored, on a winged beast." ...|$|E

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1970 s, {{the peace and}} {{stability}} of the Asian region has been underwritten by the simple but enormously important fact that US primacy has been uncontested by any other Asian power. That has sharply limited {{the risk of a}} major regional conflict which could have profoundly affected our nations’ well-being, which in turn has limited the kinds of wars <b>our</b> <b>militaries</b> have had to be prepared to fight. Now that is no longer true: while far from inevitable, the risk of a US-China conflict with devastating consequences for both countries is far higher today than it has been at any time since 1972, and on current trends it is likely to keep rising.  ...|$|R
