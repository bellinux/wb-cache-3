50|$|There {{are just}} over 2,000 CAD <b>Operator</b> <b>positions</b> within the MPS, and {{approximately}} 400-500 theoretically on duty {{at any given}} time. Due to staffing issues stemming from the transfer to the Metcall centres, the numbers are currently much lower, {{and a number of}} police officers have been seconded to Central Communications Command to fill vacancies; this removal of officers from active duties led to some controversy. While the Metropolitan Police Authority intended to eventually have all CAD <b>Operator</b> <b>positions</b> filled by civilians, allowing police officers to return to active duties, this civilianisation was stopped in 2010 as it was recognised by the MPS that total civilianisation would create a significant risk to London if the CCC staff went on strike and police officers (who cannot strike by law) were not trained and familiar with CCC processes.|$|E
50|$|Another {{technique}} simply automates {{the business}} of carefully making contact with cells. The <b>operator</b> <b>positions</b> a pipette over the sample and then lets the automated software take over, lowering the pipette and seeking to detect an increase in resistance on the pipette as it makes contact with a cell.

5000|$|Radio <b>Operator</b> (archaic). A <b>position</b> on {{much older}} aircraft, {{typically}} between the mid-1910s and the 1940s, where a separate crew member was often responsible for handling telegraphic and voice radio communications between the aircraft and ground stations. As radio sets became increasingly sophisticated {{and easier to}} operate, the function was taken over directly by a FO or SO, and still later by the pilot-in-command and co-pilot, making the radio <b>operator's</b> <b>position</b> redundant.|$|R

5000|$|He {{was born}} in Ontario County, New York. At age sixteen, Stager began working as an {{apprentice}} on the Rochester Daily Advertiser [...] for a printer and telegraph builder named Henry O'Reilly of Rochester, New York. After the latter had a telegraph line constructed from Philadelphia to Harrisburg he placed Stager in <b>operator</b> <b>positions</b> in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, and then at age 21 he {{was put in charge}} of the first Lancaster, Pennsylvania office in 1846. In the spring of 1848, he was made chief operator of the [...] "National lines" [...] at Cincinnati, Ohio, where he made several improvements in battery and wire arrangement. In 1852 Stager was promoted to superintendent, and also served as the first general superintendent of Western Union Company, newly consolidated in 1856.|$|E
50|$|The ball turret {{has been}} {{restored}} and a machine gun (with new ammo box) mounted {{in one of the}} waist gunner positions. New gun barrels were fabricated and added to the tail and chin positions and a fully refurbished, modified top turret has been installed. Both the ball turret and top turret can be manually operated. New signage (part of an Eagle Scout project) directs visitor attention to, and provides information about, various features of the aircraft. Crew station equipment, particularly in the radio compartment and tail gunner positions are being restored, replaced with new surplus items, or if necessary, fabricated in preparation for reinstallation when structural repairs are completed in those positions. The tail cone has been removed and structural repairs in it are nearing completion after the tedious task of stripping all old paint was completed. The same is true of the radio compartment where structural repairs are underway following the laborious task of stripping paint. All equipment from the nose has been removed from the aircraft. Stripping paint from the nose and performing much needed repairs there will follow completion of the tail gunner and radio <b>operator</b> <b>positions.</b> Wooden components have been rebuilt or refabricated, including the floor in the waist, an electrical junction box in the bomb bay, two ammo boxes (the first two of several), the tail gunner seat, the radio operator’s desk (using mostly original wooden components), and the navigator’s desk with the restoration and re-fabrication of interior wooden doors is still in progress. All props have been stripped and prepared for painting plus the tail wheel assembly and main landing gear have been cleaned and repainted. Restoration of peripheral equipment such as bombs and bomb carts is also nearing completion.|$|E
50|$|Night fighter version. Another P-82B (44-65170) {{modified}} with {{a different}} radar, the APS-4. The APS-4 was a much smaller set than the SCR-720, and operated in the 1.18 in waveband.

50|$|In {{terms of}} <b>{{operator}}</b> <b>position,</b> an <b>operator</b> may be prefix, postfix, or infix. A prefix operator immediately precedes its operand, as in −x. A postfix operator immediately succeeds its operand, as in x! for instance. An infix <b>operator</b> is <b>positioned</b> in between a left and a right operand, as in x+y. Some languages, {{most notably the}} C-syntax family, stretches this conventional terminology and speaks also of ternary infix operators (a?b:c). Theoretically it would even be possible (but not necessarily practical) to define parenthesization as a unary bifix operation.|$|R

40|$|Residues 2, 6, 8 and 10 of Mnt {{repressor}} are {{the major}} determinants of operator DNA binding and recognition. Here, we investigate the interaction of wild-type Mnt and mutants bearing the Arg 2 [...] Lys, His 6 [...] Ala, Asn 8 [...] Ala and Arg 10 [...] Lys mutations with operator DNA modified by methylation or by symmetric base substitutions. The wild-type pattern of methylation interference is altered in specific ways {{for each of the}} mutant proteins. In addition, some of the mutant proteins show a 'loss of contact' phenotype with specific mutant operators. Taken together, these and previous results predict the following contacts between side chains in the Mnt tetramer and operator DNA: Arg 2 recognizes the guanines at <b>operator</b> <b>positions</b> 10 and 12; His 6 contacts the guanines at <b>operator</b> <b>positions</b> 5 and 17; Asn 8 contacts <b>operator</b> <b>positions</b> 4, 7, 15 and 18; Arg 10 contacts the guanines at <b>operator</b> <b>positions</b> 8 and 14. The proposed contacts can be accommodated in a structural model in which the anti-parallel beta-sheet motifs of Mnt dimers lie in the major grooves of each operator half-site, centered over pseudo-symmetry axes that are 5. 5 bp from the central dyad axis of the operator...|$|E

40|$|Two genetic {{approaches}} {{were taken}} to define the DNA binding domain of LexA protein, the repressor of the Escherichia coli SOS regulon. First, several dominant negative lexA mutants defective in DNA binding were isolated. The mutations altered amino acids in a region similar to the helix-turn-helix, a DNA binding domain of other repressors and DNA binding proteins. Second, the region encoding the predicted DNA recognition helix was subjected to oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis and mutant LexA proteins with altered or relaxed specificity for several recA <b>operator</b> <b>positions</b> were isolated. By examining {{the effects of a}} series of amino acid substitutions on repressor specificity, it was shown that a glutamic acid residue at position 45 in LexA protein is important for recognition of the first base pair (G.
