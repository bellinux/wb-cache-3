40|$|Accidental gas explosions are a {{recognised}} hazard {{in process}} industries {{but they are}} also common in residential buildings. Whilst process plants have specifically designed vent reliefs to limit the enclosure damage, in homes a similar effect is achieved due to the presence of doors and windows whose failure often protects the building. There are empirically based correlations for predicting overpressure and for vent sizing, however these are limited in application to simple enclosures. In practice, enclosures have interconnected spaces which would potentially increase the flame acceleration considerably. In this paper we present the results of full scale natural gas layer tests in a twin chamber, which consisted of two 22 m 3 enclosures connected by an open doorway. Layered natural gas/air mixtures of 8, 10 and 12 % by volume, were ignited at the rear of one of the chambers. Explosion relief was provided by vent openings of 2. 48, 1. 49 or 0. 74 m 2 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>walls</b> of both chambers. With tests with equal large vents <b>on</b> each of <b>the</b> chambers, the dominant influence was the external explosion. The maximum overpressure was produced by tests involving a 12 % natural gas concentration. The use of a smaller vent in the adjoining enclosure had a significant effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> maximum overpressure and the mechanism of the explosion development. However, altering the size from 1. 49 m 2 to 0. 74 m 2 had little overall effect. This was largely due to the greater generation of turbulence and the venting process which predominantly occurred via the doorway and through the ignition-chamber vent opening. The use of a smaller vent in the ignition enclosure also altered {{the manner in which the}} explosion developed. A venting driven ‘jetting’ expanding flame, propagated into the adjoining enclosure and towards <b>the</b> <b>far</b> vent opening, generating the dominant pressure peak in these type of tests...|$|R

40|$|A {{high-order}} accurate shock- and interface-capturing {{scheme is}} used to simulate {{the collapse of a}} gas bubble in water. In order to better understand the damage caused by collapsing bubbles, the dynamics of the shock-induced and Rayleigh collapse of a bubble near a planar rigid surface and in a free field are analysed. Collapse times, bubble displacements, interfacial velocities and surface pressures are quantified {{as a function of the}} pressure ratio driving the collapse and of the initial bubble stand-off distance from the wall; these quantities are compared to the available theory and experiments and show good agreement with the data for both the bubble dynamics and the propagation of the shock emitted upon the collapse. Non-spherical collapse involves the formation of a re-entrant jet directed towards the wall or in the direction of propagation of the incoming shock. In shock-induced collapse, very high jet velocities can be achieved, and the finite time for shock propagation through the bubble may be non-negligible compared to the collapse time for the pressure ratios of interest. Several types of shock waves are generated during the collapse, including precursor and water-hammer shocks that arise from the re-entrant jet formation and its impact upon the distal side of the bubble, respectively. The water-hammer shock can generate very high pressures <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>far</b> exceeding those from the incident shock. The potential damage to the neighbouring surface is quantified by measuring the wall pressure. The range of stand-off distances and the surface area for which amplification of the incident shock due to bubble collapse occurs is determined. 1...|$|R
