5|$|As it {{was their}} first studio album in almost {{eighteen}} months (and coming after the success of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band) expectations were high at the time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>release</b> of The Beatles. The album debuted at number 1 in the UK on 7 December 1968. It spent seven weeks {{at the top of}} the UK charts (including the entire competitive Christmas season), until it was replaced by the Seekers' Best of the Seekers on 25 January 1969, dropping to number 2. However, the album returned to the top spot the next week, spending an eighth and final week at number 1. The album was still high in the charts when the Beatles' follow-up album, Yellow Submarine, was released, which reached number 3. In all, The Beatles spent 22 weeks on the UK charts, far fewer than the 149 weeks for Sgt. Pepper. In September 2013 after the British Phonographic Industry changed their sales award rules, the album was declared as having gone platinum, meaning sales of at least 300,000 copies.|$|E

5|$|Due to the band's slow progress, Shields {{contemplated}} relocating to New York City, {{where members}} of his family were living at the time. However, Creation Records co-founder Joe Foster had decided to establish his own record label, Kaleidoscope Sound and persuaded My Bloody Valentine to record and release an EP. The New Record by My Bloody Valentine, produced by Foster, was released in October 1986 and was a minor success, peaking at number 22 on the UK Indie Chart upon its release. On the strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>release,</b> the band began performing more frequent shows, later developing a small following and travelling outside London for live performances, supporting and opening for bands such as The Membranes.|$|E
5|$|During {{the spring}} of 1990, Anjali Dutt was hired to replace Moulder, who had left {{to work with the}} bands Shakespears Sister and Ride. Dutt {{assisted}} in the recording of vocals and several guitar tracks. During this period, the band recorded in various studios, often spending just a single day at a studio before deciding that it was unsuitable. In May 1990, My Bloody Valentine settled on Protocol in Holloway as their primary location, and work began in earnest on the album, as well as a second EP, Tremolo. Like Glider, Tremolo contained a song—"To Here Knows When"—that would later appear on Loveless. The band stopped recording during the summer of 1990 in order to tour in support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>release</b> of Glider. When Moulder returned to the project in August, he was surprised by how little work had been completed. By that point Creation Records was concerned at how much the album was costing. Moulder left again in March 1991 to work for the noise pop band The Jesus and Mary Chain.|$|E
