5|$|Because of {{construction}} delays, {{a number of}} nuclear power plants in the United States have resorted to dry cask storage of waste <b>on-site</b> indefinitely in steel and concrete casks.|$|E
5|$|Living Computer Museum, a {{collection}} of vintage computers in working order and available for interactive sessions <b>on-site</b> or through networked access, {{opened to the public}} in 2012.|$|E
5|$|On January 24, 2007, {{the school}} {{successfully}} completed an <b>on-site</b> review by a TRACS assessment team, and was granted full accreditation in April.|$|E
5|$|SAS offers <b>on-site</b> {{day care}} {{services}} to its employees for 850 children {{for about a}} third of the normal cost. Medical services are provided to employees and their families for free and 80% of the cost is covered for specialists. Employees are encouraged to work 35-hour weeks and have free access to a recreation and fitness center as well as life counseling services. It also hosts a summer camp for children and operates <b>on-site</b> cafeterias and cafes. 22.5 tons of M are provided each year, in jars that are re-filled every Wednesday. Similar amenities are provided at its other offices besides its headquarters.|$|E
5|$|SAS started {{building}} its current headquarters in a forested area of Cary, North Carolina in 1980. Later that year it started providing <b>on-site</b> daycare {{in order to}} keep an employee who was planning on being a stay-at-home mom. By 1984, SAS had begun building a fitness center, medical center, <b>on-site</b> cafe and other facilities. It had also developed some of its other benefits programs. SAS became known as a good place to work and was frequently recognized by national magazines like BusinessWeek, Working Mother and Fortune for its work environment.|$|E
5|$|The {{extraction}} of the useful components of oil shale usually takes place above ground (ex-situ processing), although several newer technologies perform this underground (<b>on-site</b> or in-situ processing).|$|E
5|$|An alloy of {{aluminium}} and gallium in pellet form added to {{water can be}} used to generate hydrogen. The process also produces alumina, but the expensive gallium, which prevents the formation of an oxide skin on the pellets, can be re-used. This has important potential implications for a hydrogen economy, as hydrogen can be produced <b>on-site</b> and {{does not need to be}} transported.|$|E
5|$|Denver and {{surrounding}} cities {{are home to}} {{a large number of}} local and national breweries. Many of the region's restaurants have <b>on-site</b> breweries, and some larger brewers offer tours, including Coors and New Belgium Brewing Company. The city also welcomes visitors from around the world when it hosts the annual Great American Beer Festival each fall.|$|E
5|$|Eakins {{made several}} <b>on-site</b> oil {{sketches}} and photographic studies before painting The Swimming Hole. It is unknown whether the photographs were taken before the oil sketches were produced {{or vice versa}} (or, indeed, whether they were created on the same day).|$|E
5|$|Flux-cored wire is {{considered}} to have some advantages for outdoor welding <b>on-site,</b> as the shielding gas plume {{is less likely to}} be blown away in a wind than shield gas from a conventional nozzle. A slight drawback is that, like SMAW (stick) welding, there may be some flux deposited over the weld bead, requiring more of a cleaning process between passes.|$|E
5|$|SAS has {{developed}} a model workplace environment and benefits program designed to retain employees, allow them to focus on their work, and reduce operating costs. It provides <b>on-site,</b> subsidized or free healthcare, gyms, daycare and life counseling services.|$|E
5|$|Self-storage {{locations}} {{tend to be}} {{in dense}} clusters in major cities, especially near freeways and intersections. Public Storage has very few employees for a company of its size. Customer access to each storage location is automated. Some locations have a husband-wife couple that live <b>on-site</b> and are paid close to minimum wage to monitor the facility.|$|E
5|$|Shale oil {{extraction}} is usually performed above ground (ex situ processing) by mining the oil shale and then treating it in processing facilities. Other modern technologies perform the processing underground (<b>on-site</b> or in situ processing) by applying heat and extracting the oil via oil wells.|$|E
5|$|The {{change in}} {{structural}} material from masonry to iron allowed Bartholdi {{to change his}} plans for the statue's assembly. He had originally expected to assemble the skin <b>on-site</b> as the masonry pier was built; instead he decided to build the statue in France and have it disassembled and transported to the United States for reassembly in place on Bedloe's Island.|$|E
5|$|The {{limestone}} {{used for}} construction was local and quarried <b>on-site.</b> The depressions {{formed by the}} extraction of stone for building were plastered to waterproof them and were used as reservoirs, together with some waterproofed natural depressions. The main plazas were surfaced with stucco and laid at a gradient that channelled rainfall into a system of canals that fed the reservoirs.|$|E
5|$|The museum {{includes}} a media centre, where {{the general public}} can access the internet without charge on one of nine computers; a library, {{with a collection of}} approximately 12,000 books; and a room in which digitalised copies of old newspapers and magazines can be read. Digitalisation of this media is completed <b>on-site.</b> A microfilm room is available, though it is no longer used.|$|E
5|$|The {{restoration}} of Tōdai-ji's Nandaimon gate in 1930 saw improved standards for preservation. An architect supervised the reconstruction works <b>on-site.</b> Extensive restoration reports became the norm, including plans, results of surveys, historical sources, and {{documentation of the}} work done. During the 1930s, about 70–75% of restoration costs came from the national budget, which increased even during the war.|$|E
5|$|The town {{is home to}} the Plymouth Municipal Airport, {{which lies}} on the border between Plymouth and Carver. Founded in 1931, it offers {{scheduled}} service to Nantucket, as well as private service. The airport features a local restaurant and gift shop, but does not have an <b>on-site</b> traffic control tower.|$|E
5|$|There are <b>on-site</b> parking {{facilities}} for supporters (limited to 230 spaces) {{and the streets}} surrounding the ground allow parking only for residents with permits. The Car Parking resident parking scheme is operated by Liverpool City Council.|$|E
5|$|To promote sustainability, {{the site}} was {{selected}} directly adjacent to an already used part of a major ski area. It was also designed to minimize vegetation and the ecological footprint in the area. For energy efficiency, trees were retained to cast shade with weather protection and a shading system used to cover parts of the track. The track itself is painted white to maintain low temperatures while minimizing energy demand on the refrigeration system. Waste heat from the refrigeration plant is captured and reused to heat buildings <b>on-site,</b> and could provide other heat uses in the future. Any wood waste created from site clearing activities during venue construction was composted for reuse. Other <b>on-site</b> buildings also followed similar green building design principles.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{its sister}} site at Watten, {{there was no}} <b>on-site</b> power plant. Electricity at Wizernes was {{provided}} by {{a connection to the}} main electric grid, with power consumption estimated at between 5,000 and 6,000 kVA.|$|E
5|$|Access to {{improved}} sanitation is also universal, either through sewers or <b>on-site</b> sanitation. All collected waste water is treated at secondary-level treatment plants. All effluents discharged to closed or semi-closed water bodies, such as Tokyo Bay, Osaka Bay, or Lake Biwa, are further treated to tertiary level. This applies to about 15% of waste water. The effluent quality is remarkably good at 3–10mg/l of BOD for secondary-level treatment, {{well below the}} national effluent standard of 20mg/l.|$|E
5|$|All {{specimens}} of Ocepeia {{come from the}} Ouled Abdoun Basin of Morocco, a phosphate basin. Research on Ocepeia {{has been carried out}} by French and Moroccan researchers led by Dr. Emmanuel Gheerbrant of the National Museum of Natural History in Paris. Ocepeia fossils have been recovered from the Grand Daoui, Meraa El Arech, and Sidi Chennane quarries, with the latter bearing the most complete specimens. Some of the original material was collected <b>on-site</b> as early as 1997, while other material was obtained from fossil dealers.|$|E
5|$|At Oak Ridge, uranium slugs were {{irradiated}} for 40 days, {{then left}} {{to cool down}} for 1 to 5 days, then dissolved. Barium then was extracted and the solution evaporated; the solid material was then shipped to Los Alamos. As of 1949, full production runs involved up to 1728 slugs (34.5 batches of 50 slugs). Until 1949 the Oak Ridge production site processed uranium slugs irradiated both <b>on-site</b> and at Hanford; afterward only Hanford material was processed.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{complexity}} of the missile and the need for extensive testing prior to launch, the V-2's designers at the Peenemünde Army Research Center favoured using heavily defended fixed sites where the missiles could be stored, armed, and fuelled from an <b>on-site</b> LOX production plant before launching. But the German Army and the V-2 project's head, Major-General Walter Dornberger, were concerned that the sites would be vulnerable to aerial attack by the Allies. The Army's preferred option was to use Meillerwagens, mobile firing batteries, which presented a much smaller target for the Allied air forces.|$|E
5|$|By March 1962, the trilateral {{talks in}} Geneva had shifted to 18-party talks at the UN Disarmament Conference. On 27 August 1962, within that conference, the US and UK offered two draft {{treaties}} to the Soviet Union. The primary proposal included a comprehensive ban verified by control posts under national command, but international supervision, and required <b>on-site</b> inspections. This {{was rejected by}} the Soviet Union due to the inspection requirement. The alternative proposal included a partial test ban—underground tests would be excluded—to be verified by national detection mechanisms, without supervision by a supranational body.|$|E
5|$|Close to {{the village}} and gorge are Batts Combe quarry and Callow Rock quarry, two of the active Quarries of the Mendip Hills where {{limestone}} is still extracted. Operating since the early 20thcentury, Batts Combe is {{owned and operated by}} Hanson Aggregates. The output in 2005 was around 4,000 tonnes of limestone per day, one third of which was supplied to an <b>on-site</b> lime kiln, which closed in 2009; the remainder was sold as coated or dusted aggregates. The limestone at this site is close to 99percent carbonate of calcium and magnesium (dolomite).|$|E
5|$|During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Brashear {{spent time}} as an amateur boxer, {{compiling}} a 2–1 record. Later on, he trained with former heavyweight champion Smokin' Joe Frazier In 2007, Brashear, along with some friends, founded the house building company DEC Construction. During the off-season, he works <b>on-site</b> performing various jobs. He has a skill for languages, speaking French and English, while also learning both Russian and Spanish. He enjoys music as well, playing the piano while learning the acoustic guitar.|$|E
5|$|Each NuScale {{reactor vessel}} is {{expected}} to be 9 feet diameter (2.74 meters) by 65 feet high (19.81 meters) and weigh 650 tons (590 metric tons). The modules would be pre-fabricated, delivered by railcar, barge or special trucks and assembled <b>on-site.</b> The units are designed to produce 50 megawatts of electricity each and require refueling with standard 4.95 percent enriched Uranium-235 fuel every two years.|$|E
5|$|Federal Hill is made {{primarily}} of brick fired <b>on-site</b> and {{laid in the}} Flemish bond pattern. The mansion possesses a foundation crafted of limestone native to the surrounding countryside. The windowsills and mantels were finely carved by a free black craftsman. The mansion is designed in the Federal Style. Federal Hill has three floors traversed by a staircase located within a central hallway on each floor and an English basement. The first floor's main rooms are a dining room, parlor, and library. The second floor consists of three bedrooms similarly spaced to the rooms below.|$|E
5|$|GTRI {{opened an}} {{international}} office in Athlone, Ireland in June 2006. This effort was expanded when Georgia Tech, the National University of Ireland, Galway and the University of Limerick partnered in June 2010 {{to create a}} joint translational research institute. GTRI has several field offices that help with nearby <b>on-site</b> research and needs. These are in Dallas, Texas, Dayton, Ohio, Shalimar, Florida (near Eglin Air Force Base), Huntsville, Alabama, Jacksonville, Florida, Orlando, Florida, Panama City, Florida, Quantico, Virginia, San Diego, California, Tucson, Arizona, Warner Robins, Georgia (near Robins Air Force Base), and Arlington, Virginia/Washington, DC.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí complemented this organic {{vision of}} {{architecture}} {{with a unique}} spatial vision {{that allowed him to}} conceive his designs in three dimensions, unlike the flat design of traditional architecture. He used to say that he had acquired this spatial sense as a boy by looking at the drawings his father made of the boilers and stills he produced. Because of this spatial conception, Gaudí always preferred to work with casts and scale models or even improvise <b>on-site</b> as a work progressed. Reluctant to draw plans, only on rare occasions did he sketch his works—in fact, only when required by authorities.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, the Petitcodiac Tidal Power Company {{proposed}} a tidal power project. This {{called for a}} dam to be built between Hopewell Cape and Fort Folly Point. The company sold shares {{to raise funds for}} the project and a series of <b>on-site</b> and airborne studies were conducted by the federal government, but the project fell through by 1928. As rail transport became more common, it displaced river transportation around the Great Depression. In addition, the Greater Moncton International Airport offered an airmail service from Moncton to Montreal by 29 December 1929. These factors further marginalised the Petitcodiac.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the WPNSA was {{selected}} to host sailing events at the 2012 Olympic Games—mainly because the Academy had recently been built, so no new venue {{would have to be}} provided. However, as part of the South West of England Regional Development Agency's plans to redevelop Osprey Quay, a new 600-berth marina and an extension with more <b>on-site</b> facilities were built. Construction was scheduled between October 2007 and the end of 2008, and with its completion and formal opening on 11 June 2009, the venue became the first of the 2012 Olympic Games to be completed.|$|E
5|$|In October 1977, the {{original}} {{parties to the}} PTBT renewed discussion of a comprehensive test ban in Geneva. Through {{the end of the}} 1970s, the US, UK, and Soviet Union reached agreement on draft provisions prohibiting all testing, temporarily banning PNEs, and establishing a verification system including <b>on-site</b> inspections. However, the sides remained at odds over the precise details of verification and talks would permanently disband with the departure of President Jimmy Carter in 1981.|$|E
5|$|In early 1960, Eisenhower {{indicated}} {{his support}} for a comprehensive test ban conditional on proper monitoring of underground tests. On 11 February 1960, Wadsworth announced a new US proposal by which only tests deemed verifiable by the Geneva System would be banned, including all atmospheric, underwater, and outer-space tests within detection range. Underground tests measuring more than 4.75 on the Richter scale would also be barred, subject to revision as research on detection continued. Adopting Macmillan's quota compromise, the US proposed each nuclear state be subject to roughly 20 <b>on-site</b> inspections per year (the precise figure based on the frequency of seismic events).|$|E
