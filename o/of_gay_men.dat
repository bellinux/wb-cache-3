5|$|The {{public image}} of homosexuals changed with liberalized social {{attitudes of the}} late 1960s. In 1969, the Stonewall riots {{occurred}} in New York City, marking {{the start of the}} gay rights movement. Though gay life in Miami was intensely closeted, and bars were subject to frequent raids, Christ Metropolitan Community Church—a congregation for gay and lesbian Christians in Miami—was founded in 1970 as a religious outlet, attracting hundreds of parishioners. The 1972 Democratic National Convention was held in Miami, featuring, for the first time, a public speech about the rights <b>of</b> <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> and lesbians by openly gay San Francisco political activist Jim Foster. Jack Campbell opened the Miami branch of Club Baths in 1974. When it was raided, he made sure that all charges against those arrested were dropped, filed a lawsuit against the Miami Police Department prohibiting further harassment, and received a formal apology from the police. Even the depiction <b>of</b> <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> and lesbians in the local newspaper had changed to that of a silent, oppressed minority. By 1977, Miami was one of nearly 40cities in the U.S. that had passed ordinances outlawing discrimination against gay men and lesbians.|$|E
5|$|In New York City, {{men like}} Larry Kramer and Paul Popham, who had {{previously}} shown no desire for leadership, were forced by bureaucratic apathy into forming the Gay Men's Health Crisis {{to raise money for}} medical research and to provide social services for scores <b>of</b> <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> who began getting sick with opportunistic infections. Shilts describes the desperate actions of the group to get recognition by Mayor Ed Koch and assistance from the city's Public Health Department to provide social services and preventive education about AIDS and unsafe sex.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the end of}} World War II, {{the major}} port city of San Francisco had been home to a sizable number <b>of</b> <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> {{expelled}} from the military who had decided to stay rather than return to their hometowns and face ostracism. By 1969 the Kinsey Institute believed San Francisco had more gay people per capita than any other American city; when the National Institute of Mental Health asked the Institute to survey homosexuals, the Institute chose San Francisco as its focus. Milk and McKinley were among the thousands <b>of</b> <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> attracted to San Francisco. McKinley was a stage manager for Tom O'Horgan, a director who started his career in experimental theater, but soon graduated to much larger Broadway productions. They arrived in 1969 with the Broadway touring company of Hair. McKinley was offered {{a job in the}} New York City production of Jesus Christ Superstar, and their tempestuous relationship came to an end. The city appealed to Milk so much that he decided to stay, working at an investment firm. In 1970, increasingly frustrated with the political climate after the U.S. invasion of Cambodia, Milk let his hair grow long. When told to cut it, he refused and was fired.|$|E

5|$|The city, {{along with}} {{adjacent}} small cities Oakland Park and Wilton Manors, {{is known for}} its large LGBT community and {{has one of the highest}} ratios <b>of</b> <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> and lesbians, with gay men being more largely present, in the United States. The city is also known as a popular vacation spot for gays and lesbians, with many LGBT or LGBT-friendly hotels and guesthouses. Fort Lauderdale hosts the Stonewall Library & Archives, and in neighboring Wilton Manors there is a large LGBT community center, the Pride Center, and the World AIDS Museum and Educational Center.|$|E
5|$|Homosexuality {{addressed}} by television started much later than films. Local talk {{shows in the}} late 1950s first addressed homosexuality by inviting panels of experts (usually not gay themselves) to discuss the problems <b>of</b> <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> in society. Lesbianism was rarely included. The first time a lesbian was portrayed on network television was the NBC drama The Eleventh Hour in the early 1960s, in a teleplay about an actress who feels she is persecuted by her female director, and in distress, calls a psychiatrist who explains she is a latent lesbian who has deep-rooted guilt about her feelings for women. When she realizes this, however, {{she is able to}} pursue healthy heterosexual relationships.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{rebellion}} at the Stonewall Inn, homosexuals were, as historians Dudley Clendinen and Adam Nagourney write, a secret legion of people, known of but discounted, ignored, laughed at or despised. And like the holders of a secret, {{they had an}} advantage which was a disadvantage, too, and which was true of no other minority group in the United States. They were invisible. Unlike African Americans, women, Native Americans, Jews, the Irish, Italians, Asians, Hispanics, or any other cultural group which struggled for respect and equal rights, homosexuals had no physical or cultural markings, no language or dialect which could identify them to each other, or to anyone else... But that night, for the first time, the usual acquiescence turned into violent resistance.... From that night {{the lives of millions}} <b>of</b> <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> and lesbians, and the attitude toward them of the larger culture in which they lived, began to change rapidly. People began to appear in public as homosexuals, demanding respect.|$|E

5|$|Macgill secured {{work in a}} Canadian touring {{production}} of , and was joined in Canada by her daughter, who gained her first theatrical job as a nightclub act at the Samovar Club, Montreal. Having gained the job by claiming to be 19 when she was 16, her act consisted of her singing songs by Noël Coward, and earned her $60 a week. She returned to New York City in August 1942, but her mother had moved to Hollywood, Los Angeles, in order to resurrect her cinematic career; Lansbury and her brothers followed. Moving into a bungalow in Laurel Canyon, both Lansbury and her mother obtained Christmas jobs at the Bullocks Wilshire department store in Los Angeles; Moyna was sacked for incompetence, leaving the family to subsist on Lansbury's wages of $28 a week. Befriending a group <b>of</b> <b>gay</b> <b>men,</b> Lansbury became privy to the city's underground gay scene, and with her mother, attended lectures by the spiritual guru Krishnamurti; at one of these, she met Aldous Huxley.|$|E
25|$|Reports {{regarding}} {{the prevalence of}} anal sex among gay men and other {{men who have sex}} with men vary. A survey in The Advocate in 1994 indicated that 46% <b>of</b> <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> preferred to penetrate their partners, while 43% preferred to be the receptive partner. Other sources suggest that roughly three-fourths <b>of</b> <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> have had anal sex at one time or another, with an equal percentage participating as tops and bottoms. A 2012 NSSHB sex survey in the U.S. suggests high lifetime participation in anal sex among gay men: 83.3% report ever taking part in anal sex in the insertive position and 90% in the receptive position, even if only between a third and a quarter self-report very recent engagement in the practice, defined as 30 days or less.|$|E

25|$|Anti-gay {{groups have}} often argued that more {{homosexual}} men are sexual abusers than heterosexuals, {{on the grounds}} that a third of abusers target boys rather than girls. This is far in excess of the proportion <b>of</b> <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> in the population. It is thus argued that gay men are disproportionately likely to offend.|$|E

25|$|Homosexuality is {{the romantic}} or sexual {{attraction}} to the same sex. People with a homosexual orientation can express their sexuality {{in a variety of}} ways, and may or may not express it in their behaviors. Research indicates that many gay men and lesbians want, and succeed in having, committed and durable relationships. For example, survey data indicate that between 40% and 60% <b>of</b> <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> and between 45% and 80% of lesbians are currently involved in a romantic relationship.|$|E
25|$|According to the Belarusian Ministry of Defense and the Center for the Study of Sexual Minorities in the Military of the University of California, Santa Barbara, Belarus bans gays {{from serving}} in the military.

40|$|Recent {{research}} in the USA, some European countries and Australia points {{to an increase in}} rates of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections amongst young <b>gay</b> <b>men.</b> Urgent action needs to be taken to meet the health promotion needs of those who are most vulnerable. HIV/AIDS awareness and sexual health promotion strategies aimed at young <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> have frequently focused on problems and needs. In contrast, the strengths and capacities <b>of</b> young <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> have largely been ignored. With these issues in mind, the research described here sought to explore the HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention needs <b>of</b> young <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> {{within the context of the}} other issues in their lives. As part of a larger research project focusing on gay and bisexual men's HIV primary prevention needs, data was collected from 77 self identified <b>gay</b> and bisexual <b>men</b> under the age of 25 living in the Greater London area. Through a participatory workshop format, both written and oral accounts were generated. Data were analysed thematically so as to identify recurrent issues and concerns. Findings illustrate the strengths <b>of</b> young <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> in coping with a range of challenging life and relationship issues, including those related to HIV. The capacity <b>of</b> young <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> to identify their own sexual health education needs is emphasised and processes through which such stated needs may be incorporated into HIV prevention and sexual health promotion strategies are discussed...|$|R
