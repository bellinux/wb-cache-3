In 1880 the club voted to play football exclusively, and the following year Sudell took responsibility for the management of the team. From 1883 the club fielded several Scottish players, after Sudell went on a recruitment expedition to Scotland. The club arranged jobs for the players, and supplemented their income with <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> payments. At this time professionalism was not permitted, but such payments were common among Lancashire clubs.|$|E
25|$|In addition, <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> {{treatment}} for securitizations coupled with guarantees from the issuer can hide {{the extent of}} leverage of the securitizing firm, thereby facilitating risky capital structures and leading to an under-pricing of credit risk. <b>Off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> securitizations also played {{a large role in}} the high leverage level of U.S. financial institutions before the financial crisis, and the need for bailouts.|$|E
25|$|Critics have {{suggested}} that the complexity inherent in securitization can limit investors' ability to monitor risks, and that competitive securitization markets with multiple securitizers may be particularly prone to sharp declines in underwriting standards. Private, competitive mortgage securitization is believed to have {{played an important role in}} the US subprime mortgage crisis. In addition, <b>off–balance</b> <b>sheet</b> treatment for securitizations coupled with guarantees from the issuer are said to make the securitizing firm's leverage less transparent, thereby facilitating risky capital structures and allowing credit risk underpricing. <b>Off–balance</b> <b>sheet</b> securitizations are believed to have played a large role in the high leverage ratio of US financial institutions before the financial crisis.|$|E

The confusing independent but government-controlled status of the GSEs has resulted in investors of the legacy common shares and preferred shares launching various activist campaigns in 2014.|$|E

50|$|Non-funded (<b>Off-Balance</b> <b>sheet)</b> Items : The {{credit risk}} {{exposure}} attached to <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> items {{has to be}} first calculated by multiplying the face amount {{of each of the}} <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> items by the Credit Conversion Factor.

5000|$|Some {{companies}} may have {{significant amounts of}} <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> assets and liabilities. For example, financial institutions often offer asset management or brokerage services to their clients. The assets managed or brokered as part of these offered services (often securities) usually belong to the individual clients directly or in trust, although the company provides management, depository or other services to the client. The company itself has no direct claim to the assets, so it does not record them on its balance sheet (they are <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> assets), while usually has some basic fiduciary duties {{with respect to the}} client. Financial institutions may report <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> items in their accounting statements formally, and may also refer to [...] "assets under management," [...] a figure that may include on and <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> items.|$|E
5000|$|Banks' {{notional}} leverage {{was more}} than twice as high, due to <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> transactions.

50|$|As {{mentioned}} above, <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> {{categories are}} also weighted: they {{will contribute to}} the long-term assets. This is best explained by the potential for contingent calls on funding liquidity (revocable and irrevocable line of credit and liquidity facilities to clients). Therefore, once the standard is in place, <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> commitments will need to be funded, within the stable funding.|$|E

5000|$|However, {{depository}} {{banks had}} moved sizable amounts of {{assets and liabilities}} <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet,</b> via complex legal entities called special purpose vehicles.
