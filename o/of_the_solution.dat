5|$|Soluble ionic {{compounds}} like salt {{can easily}} be dissolved to provide electrolyte solutions. This is {{a simple way to}} control the concentration and ionic strength. The concentration of solutes affects many colligative properties, including increasing the osmotic pressure, and causing freezing-point depression and boiling-point elevation. Because the solutes are charged ions they also increase the electrical conductivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>solution.</b> The increased ionic strength reduces the thickness of the electrical double layer around colloidal particles, and therefore the stability of emulsions and suspensions.|$|E
5|$|To {{locate a}} second {{point on the}} lines L1, L2 and L3, Gergonne noted a {{reciprocal}} relationship between those lines and the radical axis R <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> circles, CA and CB. To understand this reciprocal relationship, consider the two tangent lines to the circle C1 drawn at its tangent points A1 and B1 with the solution circles; the intersection of these tangent lines is the pole point of L1 in C1. Since the distances from that pole point to the tangent points A1 and B1 are equal, this pole point must also lie on the radical axis R <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> circles, by definition (Figure9). The relationship between pole points and their polar lines is reciprocal; if the pole of L1 in C1 lies on R, the pole of R in C1 must conversely lie on L1. Thus, if we can construct R, we can find its pole P1 in C1, giving the needed second point on L1 (Figure10).|$|E
