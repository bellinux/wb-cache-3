40|$|DOI: 10. 1007 / 978 - 1 - 4471 - 4213 - 3 International audienceSince the {{emergence}} of Nanotechnology in the past decades, the development and design of organic and bioorganic nanomaterials has become an important field of research. Such materials find many applications {{in a wide range}} of domains such as electronic, photonic, or biotechnology, which contribute to impact our society and our way of life. The improvement of properties and the discovery of new functionalities are key goals that cannot be obtained without a well controlled and a better understanding of the preparation methods which constitute the starting point of the design of a specific organic material. In this context, this chapter gives a general but non-exhaustive overview of the methods of preparation of organic and bioorganic nanoparticles. Some general definitions about organic nanoparticles and description of organic compounds are given before describing the most common methods used divided into two families, the two-step and <b>one-step</b> <b>procedures.</b> The major part of the two-step procedures is based on an emulsification step followed by generation of nanoparticles through different mechanisms such as precipitation, gelation, or polymerization. The <b>one-step</b> <b>procedures</b> are founded on generation of nanoparticles through different techniques such as nanoprecipitation, desolvation, or drying processes without preliminary emulsification step. For each method, the description is supported by several examples and focused on the explanation of the general mechanisms and of the major key parameters involved in the control of the nanoparticles formation. In addition, since emergence and improvement of syntheses are often associated to development of experimental setups, technological aspects are also mentioned. © Springer-Verlag London 2013...|$|R

Two-step procedures have problems, ranging from component misspecification to incorrect assumptions about the correlation between cyclical and non-cyclical components. In this paper, I present a one-step method, where DSGE structural parameters are jointly estimated with filtering parameters. First, I illustrate {{the properties of the}} <b>one-step</b> <b>procedures</b> using simulated data. Then, I show that different data transformations imply different structural estimates and that two-step approaches lack a statistical-based criterion to select amongst them. The one-step approach allows to choose the most likely specification of the non-cyclical component for individual series and/or to construct robust estimates by Bayesian averaging.

All cell types used so far require in vitro expansion prior to clinical use, as these cells are only limited available. Adipose-tissue is an abundant, expendable and easily accessible source of mesenchymal stem cells. The use of these cells therefore {{eliminates the need for}} in vitro expansion and subsequently one-step regenerative treatment strategies can be developed. Our group envisioned, described and evaluated such a <b>one-step</b> <b>procedure</b> for spinal fusion in the goat model. In this review, we summarize the current status of cell-based treatments for intervertebral disc degeneration and identify the additional research needed before adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells can be evaluated in a <b>one-step</b> <b>procedure</b> for regenerative treatment of the intervertebral disc. We address the selection of stem cells from the stromal vascular fraction, the specific triggers needed for cell differentiation and potential suitable scaffolds. Although many factors need to be studied in more detail, potential application of a <b>one-step</b> <b>procedure</b> for intervertebral disc regeneration seems realistic. © 2008 Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine/Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|E

Even then, it is concluded that certain <b>one-step</b> <b>procedures</b> incorporating two or more extrapolations over each constant. increment of time produce errors which grow most slowly.

40|$|To {{correctly}} assess {{trends in}} water quality data, influencing {{variables such as}} discharge or temperature {{must be taken into}} account.

Two-step procedures are particularly useful when the shape of the temporal trend is the primary interest, but they can be misleading if one of the influencing variables itself exhibits a trend or long-term tendency.
