50|$|With {{the arrival}} of European {{settlers}} in the area came myths and legends not indigenous to the Guaraní people. Over time the myth of Luison slowly began to mix with the imported legend of the werewolf, {{to the point where}} Luison began to lose many of his associations with death. In many areas of the Guaraní-speaking world the Luison's description has changed to that of a <b>half</b> man, <b>half</b> <b>dog</b> creature, and now bears many similarities to the classical werewolf story. Modern tales tell of a Luison that hunts {{by the light of the}} moon, is no longer confined to cemeteries and may hunt living victims down for food. It is sometimes also believed that the curse of the Luison may be transferred to other victims via biting, much as the curse of the werewolf. In part the transition from the original myth to a more werewolf-like creature is because Luison was the seventh son. The seventh son, especially in Paraguay, was thought to be cursed to become a werewolf.|$|R
