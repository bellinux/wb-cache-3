5|$|In August, 1874, Ezra Abbot sent to Scrivener a letter: {{the rough}} draught of which covered forty odd pages, {{devoted to the}} {{correction}} of apparent errors and a statement of overlooked facts in {{the first edition of}} the Plain Introduction. The letter came too late to be used in preparing the body of the second edition of Scrivener's work. Abbot's studies largely argumented the number <b>of</b> <b>suggestions,</b> particularly in those portions of the book devoted to describing the extant manuscripts. They were accumulated in great part to the older and well-known authorities - such as Griesbach, Matthaei, Scholz (particularly his work Biblisch-kritische Reise, Leipzig 1823), Bianchini, Montfaucon, Silvestre, Bandini, Laubecius, and Zaeagni. Part <b>of</b> <b>suggestions</b> were a result of Abbott's studies of recent edited Catalogues of the ancient Greek Manuscripts held in the British Museum, Bodleian Library, Oxford Catalogues, Kitchin's Catalogue of the manuscripts in the Library of Christ Church College (Oxrofd, 1867). Abbott added numerous references to facsimile editions.|$|E

40|$|Suggestion schemes are {{becoming}} increasingly popular in organisations in the UK and elsewhere, {{but they are not}} normally studied from the viewpoint of information systems. This paper seeks to make good the omission. After briefly reviewing the nature and status <b>of</b> <b>suggestion</b> schemes, the paper describes fieldwork that has investigated both private sector and public sector suggestion schemes and implemented an experimental scheme. The evidence of the fieldwork is analysed to reveal the organisational structure <b>of</b> <b>suggestion</b> schemes and their use of automation. The role <b>of</b> <b>suggestion</b> schemes in relation to various types of knowledge and idealised forms of organisation is examined. The purpose of this analysis is partly to improve understanding <b>of</b> <b>suggestion</b> schemes, and partly to show how they can contribute to knowledge management and communication within organisations. The paper concludes by identifying ways in which an understanding <b>of</b> <b>suggestion</b> schemes can contribute to the design of large-scale knowledge management systems...|$|R

Maritime author Wolff reported that depending on weather conditions, all the clamps were eventually set within one to two days. Captain Paquette of Wilfred Sykes was dismissive <b>of</b> <b>suggestions</b> that unlocked hatch clamps caused Fitzgerald to founder. He said that he commonly sailed in fine weather using the minimum number of clamps necessary to secure the hatch covers.|$|E

Five months later, when Holst was in Greece, Boult introduced The Planets to the general public, at a concert in February 1919; Holst sent him a long letter full <b>of</b> <b>suggestions,</b> but failed to convince him that the suite should be played in full. The conductor believed that about half an hour of such radically new music was all the public could absorb at first hearing, and he gave only five of the seven movements on that occasion.|$|E
5|$|At {{their first}} series of {{meetings}} on 14 September, the Night Defence Committee began collecting a series <b>of</b> <b>suggestions</b> for improvements, which were discussed in depth on 1 October. These were passed on to Dowding for implementation, but he found that many of their suggestions were already out of date. For instance, they suggested building new radars {{that could be used}} over land, allowing the fight to continue throughout the raid. A contract for this type of radar had already been sent out in June or July. They suggested that the filter room at RAF Bentley Priory be devolved down to the Group headquarters to improve the flow of information, but Dowding had already gone a step further and devolved night interception to the Sector level at the airfields. Dowding accepted only four of the suggestions.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – Although the {{corporations}} widely use the suggestion schemes to elicit the creative ideas of their employee, sustaining a suggestion scheme {{is still a}} challenge. Employee suggestion schemes have been studied from many perspectives to illustrate its objectives, nature, content, process, significance and the benefits. Arguments have also been made {{with respect to the}} success and failures <b>of</b> the <b>suggestion</b> schemes. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to explore the factors to assess the sustainability <b>of</b> a <b>suggestion</b> system. Design/methodology/approach – This paper thus explores the critical success factors <b>of</b> <b>suggestion</b> scheme through a literature review and filters the critical determinants for sustainability <b>of</b> <b>suggestion</b> using factor analysis. The data collection was done using a survey technique. Findings – The results identity the five major factors as determinants to sustainability <b>of</b> a <b>suggestion</b> system as reported in the paper. Originality/value – This paper has made an attempt to explore the determinants to assess the sustainability <b>of</b> a <b>suggestion</b> system and has contributed toward the new knowledge in terms of sustainability <b>of</b> a <b>suggestion</b> system...|$|R
5|$|Balakirev's despotism {{strained}} {{the relationship}} between him and Tchaikovsky but both men still appreciated each other's abilities. Despite their friction, Balakirev proved the only man to persuade Tchaikovsky to rewrite a work several times, as he would with Romeo and Juliet. At Balakirev's suggestion, Tchaikovsky based the work on Balakirev's King Lear, a tragic overture in sonata form after the example of Beethoven's concert overtures. It was Tchaikovsky's idea to reduce the plot to one central conflict and represent it musically with the binary structure of sonata form. However, the execution of that plot in the music we know today came only after two radical revisions. Balakirev discarded many of the early drafts Tchaikovsky sent him and, with the flurry <b>of</b> <b>suggestions</b> between the two men, the piece was constantly in the mail between Moscow and Saint Petersburg.|$|E

Von Neumann was {{impressed}} by the implosion concept and, working with Edward Teller, an old friend, made a series <b>of</b> <b>suggestions.</b> Von Neumann was able to create a sound mathematical model of implosion, enabling Neddermeyer to present a proposal for a greatly expanded research program. Edwin McMillan and Isidor Isaac Rabi recommended that George Kistiakowsky, who had a specialized knowledge in the precision use of explosives, be brought in to help the program. In February 1944, Kistiakowsky became Parsons' deputy for implosion.|$|E

5|$|Development of the PlayStation Vita port began {{shortly before}} the start of the game's service in 2014. The team formed a {{partnership}} with Sony to develop the title, but production ran into difficulties as the team attempted to create an experience of the same quality as the mobile version, along with adjusting the controls from touch-based to the button and joystick controls of the Vita. There was also some resistance from staff surrounding the usage of the Mana franchise and Oyamada's determination to bring Rise of Mana to consoles in the face <b>of</b> <b>suggestions</b> that it would be better to make a completely new game. When the project was proposed to Sony, the Unity technology built into the Vita was fairly new and did not make full use of the platform's processing power. In addition, the staff were unused to the version of Unity for the Vita. The team needed cooperation from both Sony and Unity Technologies to optimize the engine so the game could run on the new platform. By the time of the Vita version's announcement, only the preliminary development work had been completed, but development was proceeding according to plan. Technical troubles related to the game's performance persisted beyond this point, resulting in the release being delayed into the following year.|$|E

25|$|In November 1934, the Air Ministry issued Specification F.5/34 which, {{drawing on}} the work of Squadron Leader Ralph Sorley, called for new fighter {{aircraft}} to be armed with a total of eight guns.

By January 1935, a wooden mock-up had been finished, and although a number <b>of</b> <b>suggestions</b> for detail changes were made, construction of the prototype was approved, and a new specification (F.36/34) was written around the design. In July 1935, this specification was amended to include installation of eight guns.|$|E
25|$|A number <b>of</b> <b>suggestions</b> {{were made}} for {{ways to improve the}} {{popularity}} of county cricket during the season, with the authorities worried that a four-year break would see lower crowds. The only change to be adopted was a reduction in the length of the matches, from three days down to two. This, however, did not prove popular, and was changed for the following 1920 season. Other proposals, such as shorter boundaries, and limits on the number of professional cricketers fielded by a county side were not enacted, to the relief of the editor of the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, Sydney Pardon.|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} <b>of</b> <b>suggestion</b> and suggestibility {{have been}} frequent {{ever since the}} last decade of the nineteenth century when research began almost simultaneously in the United States, France and Germany. Since then, suggestibility has been studied by workers in various fields: abnormal psychology, social psychology, sociology and individual differences. The exponents of the Nancy theory of hypnosis, who consider that the hypnotic trance is a "state of heightened suggestibility," of course studied suggestibility as an abnormal phenomenon. Murphy and Murphy (231, p. 5) writing as social psychologists consider that the experimental study <b>of</b> <b>suggestion</b> marked the beginning of experimental social psychology.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{innovative}} {{in that it}} draws together the concepts <b>of</b> <b>suggestion</b> from several cultural groups and develops an inventory to account for variations the occurrence of scale to studies the relatively new area of the effects <b>of</b> <b>suggestion</b> in classrooms and compares effect on personality and academic variables. As new ideas and knowledge become more widespread and accepted by the community and teaching profession, precision in the applications <b>of</b> <b>suggestion</b> {{in the classroom is}} being seen as more important. Although new to education, suggestion and similar variations has always been central to influencing behaviour and learning among pastoral, counseling and hypnotherapy fields. Teachers who had experience or influence from those fields or the ideas of Lozanov (1978) or accelerated learning groups were and are more the exception than the rule. However, as new ideas become more influential, the influence <b>of</b> <b>suggestion</b> in is becoming increasingly important in progressive, modern education. A major goal {{of the study was to}} provide a valid instrument to compare Chinese and Australian differences and similarities in use <b>of</b> <b>suggestion</b> in learning. It was hoped that such a comparison would provide increased mutual understanding of values, strategies, practices and preferences by teachers and students. A second goal was to develop a causative model that explained the relationships between the measured variables of personality and learning behaviour and suggestion in teaching and learning [...] A third aim was to make a comparison on effects and performance <b>of</b> <b>suggestion</b> in teaching and learning in Australian, Chinese and Australian accelerative learning classes. This study examined differences between Australian and Chinese high school Science classrooms in their use <b>of</b> <b>suggestion</b> in teaching and learning. To ascertain the prevalence and types <b>of</b> <b>suggestion</b> in the classroom the 39 -item suggestion in teaching and learning (STL) scale was developed and validated v in Year 7, 9, and 11 high school classes in China and Australia. The STL scale categorized suggestion into the following types or subscales: Selfsuggestion, metaphor, indirect non-verbal suggestion, general spoken suggestion, negative suggestion, intuitive suggestion, direct verbal suggestion, relaxation, and de-suggestion. The study involved surveying 344 participants (n= 182 female, n= 162 male) from four high schools in Australia and China. A further 374 participants (n= 108 teachers, n= 266 students) from six high schools were surveyed for selecting a Chinese sample in a pilot study. About 284 participants (China: 200 students; Australia: 84 students [includes 8 adults]) were observed for validation of the STL instrument. All subjects and classes were randomly selected and were surveyed and observed for the purpose of scale and model development. The STL scale was found to be capable of distinguishing different types <b>of</b> <b>suggestion</b> within Chinese, Australian, and Australian Accelerative Learning classes. The STL scale was significant as a first scale to measure suggestion in teaching and learning in Australian and Chinese classrooms. Items in the scale were strongly and significantly correlated with other items within the subscales and with the overall scale. Path analytic techniques were used to explain relationships between the STL scale, its subscales, nation, gender and high school students profiles on stress, depression, learning styles and academic grades. Limitations of the study included problems arising from language and cultural differences as well as newness of the scale and the field of study. Recommendations for further study included strengthening aspects of the scale with new items and further qualitative and quantitative studies on the uses <b>of</b> <b>suggestion</b> in academic learning and other forms of change in childhood and adolescence...|$|R
