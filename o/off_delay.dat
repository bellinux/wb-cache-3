40|$|Problem statement: In recent times, {{wireless}} {{networks have}} become ubiquitous and the hotspot research arena. When a mobile node switches from one access network to another network, the node {{is said to}} perform a handoff. This transition is a complex and time-consuming task since after transit the mobile node has to obtain a new Care of Address (CoA) from the transited AR and bind this CoA with its home agent, apart from this there occurs a problem of packet loss. However there exist some solutions for this handoff problem, these mechanisms do not offer efficient solution for the problem. Approach: A mechanism to reduce the hand <b>off</b> <b>delay</b> in vehicular networks is proposed in this article. This approach pre allocates the new address for the mobile node before hand off based on its mobility. Results: The proposed system is implemented in ns 2 simulation environment and compared with some existing hand of mechanisms and its evident that the proposed mechanism reduces the hand <b>off</b> <b>delay</b> and packet loss ratio. Conclusion: This article is concerned with defining a better solution for the handoff problem such that the proposed mechanism offers efficient results compared to the existing system...|$|E

The results in the literature have focused on the asymptotics of how many samples are required and the probability of making an error for a fixed batch of samples. We investigate an alternative scenario where observations are available in sequence and can be stopped as soon as there is reasonable certainty of correct reconstruction. For the random Gaussian ensemble we show that a simple stopping rule gives the absolute minimum number of observations required for exact recovery, with probability one. However, for other ensembles like Bernoulli or Fourier, this is no longer true, and the rule is modified to trade <b>off</b> <b>delay</b> in stopping and probability of error. We also describe a stopping rule for the nearsparse case which tells when enough observations are made to reach a desired tolerance in reconstruction.

40|$|Infostations offer {{geographically}} intermittent coverage at {{high data}} rates for mobile wireless networks. The Infostation model trades <b>off</b> <b>delay</b> of data delivery for increased network capacity. Replication and storage {{of information in}} multiple nodes of a mobile network can also be traded off for reduction in delay. Thus, augmenting the Infostation model with information replication, a new concept which we refer to here as the Shared Wireless Infostation Model (SWIM), results in overall improved capacity-delay tradeoff {{at the expense of}} modestly increased storage requirements. In this paper, we propose to apply SWIM to solve a practical problem- information acquisition from radio-tagged whales. In particular, we calculate the expected storage increase for the reduction in delay. Storage requirements can be further improved without affecting the delay by wisely erasing the replicated information from the network nodes. We study the performance of five storage/erasure techniques, which increase the computational complexity of the storage algorithm, in order to further mitigate the storage increase. The results of our study will allow a network designer to implement such a system with a sufficient buffer size, as to ensure with some level of confidence that the information will be success-∗ This work is based on an earlier work: “The Shared Wireles...|$|E
40|$|Power {{semiconductor}} devices have finite turn on {{and turn off}} delays {{that may not be}} perfectly matched. In a leg of a voltage source converter, the simultaneous turn on of one device and the turn off of the complementary device will cause a DC bus shoot through, if the turn <b>off</b> <b>delay</b> is larger than the turn on delay time. To avoid this situation it is common practice to blank the two complementary devices in a leg for a small duration of time while switching, which is called dead time. This paper proposes a logic circuit for digital implementation required to control the complementary devices of a leg independently {{and at the same time}} preventing cross conduction of devices in a leg, and while providing accurate and stable dead time. This implementation is based on the concept of finite state machines. This circuit can also block improper PWM pulses to semiconductor switches and filters small pulses notches below a threshold time width as the narrow pulses do not provide any significant contribution to average pole voltage, but leads to increased switching loss. This proposed dead time logic has been implemented in a CPLD and is implemented in a protection and delay card for 3 - power converters...|$|E
40|$|We {{address the}} {{challenge}} of energy efficiency in hierarchical spectrum sharing networks with dynamic traffic. We consider a primary and a cognitive secondary transmitter-receiver pair, where the secondary transmitter can utilize cooperative transmission to relay primary traffic while superimposing its own information. The secondary user meets a dilemma in this scenario. By choosing cooperation, it can transmit a packet immediately, {{but it has to}} bear the additional cost of relaying. Otherwise, it can wait for the primary user to become idle, which increases the queuing delay that secondary packets experience. To solve this dilemma and trade <b>off</b> <b>delay</b> and energy consumption, we propose dynamic cooperative secondary access control that takes the state of the spectrum sharing network into account. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and prove the existence of a stationary policy that is average cost optimal. We evaluate reinforcement learning to find optimal transmission strategy when the traffic and link statistics are not known. We demonstrate that dynamic cooperation is necessary for the secondary system to be able to adapt to changing network conditions and show that optimal sequential decision can significantly improve the tradeoff of the energy consumption and the delay.
