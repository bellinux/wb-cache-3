5|$|Despite {{penetrations}} inland, the key beach objectives had {{not been}} achieved. The draws necessary for the movement of vehicles <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> {{had not been}} opened, and the strongpoints defending these were still putting up a spirited resistance. The failure to clear beach obstacles forced subsequent landings to concentrate on Easy Green and Easy Red.|$|E
5|$|Historian Adrian R. Lewis postulates that American {{casualties}} {{would have}} been greatly reduced if a longer barrage had been implemented, although the First Infantry Division Chief of Staff stated that the Division {{would not have been}} able to move <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> without effective naval gunfire.|$|E
5|$|Later on 13 September 1942 Captain Lord Howard and Lieutenant Hall were hospitalised {{because of}} their injuries, while Winter and Desgranges were taken to Caen for interrogation. At the time, the Germans were unaware that four commandos—Captain Burton, Privates Hollings and Orr, and Captain Hayes—had managed to evade capture and made it <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach.</b>|$|E

5|$|The highest winds {{reported}} {{during the}} storm were 34.9m/s (78mph, 126km/h). These winds blew sand about 7cm (3in) deep <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> and into residents' yards. Typhoon Ewiniar caused a reported 20,000,000yen ($173,778) worth of sugar cane and vegetable damage, and farmers experienced profit losses when ripe fruits {{were unable to}} be shipped to Asian markets.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with these}} disappearances, a killer whale carcass bearing large wounds is beached. Police Chief Martin Brody {{believes}} that these events are {{the work of}} a shark. Brody explains his concerns to Mayor Larry Vaughn, who highly doubts that the town has another shark problem. Later, Brody finds debris from the destroyed speedboat in the surf just <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach.</b> He wades over to retrieve it and uncovers the boat driver's burnt remains.|$|E
5|$|Captain Warburton-Lee {{was brought}} ashore but died {{after an hour}} from his head wounds. 139 other men managed to get ashore, {{although}} 26 were seriously wounded. Captain Warburton-Lee was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. Hardy was lifted <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> at high tide and drifted {{to the head of}} Skjomen fjord where she capsized in shallow waters. The wreck was still visible as late as 1963.|$|E

5|$|On 27 April 1944 a Liberator {{aircraft}} {{from the}} 392nd USAAF bombing group Based in East Anglia near Wendling, Norfolk, crashed <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> {{adjacent to the}} Westgate Pavilion, with five of the crew killed and four injured in the crash. A special memorial service was held for the crew by the Mayor of Margate and veterans organisations on 27 April 2009 at the war memorial overlooking the crash site.|$|E
5|$|Water voles are {{a highly}} {{threatened}} {{species in the}} UK, with a huge decline in numbers, mainly due to predation by the introduced American mink. They are still common at Titchwell, {{which is one of}} a number of East Anglian sites now of national importance for this species. Both common and grey seals can be seen <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach.</b> Other vertebrates include European eels, common toads and three-spined sticklebacks.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish ships sought {{shelter from}} the British north of Trafalgar in Conil Bay, the {{entrance}} to which was protected by a large rocky ledge. Irresistible and Emerald negotiated this obstacle at around 14:30 and engaged the Spanish ships, which were anchored in the Bay. The Spanish ships surrendered at approximately 16:00. Eighteen Spaniards were killed and 30 wounded during the fighting; one Briton was killed and one wounded. The remaining crew of Santa Elena avoided capture by cutting her cables and drifting her on shore so they could flee on foot. The British managed to drag Santa Elena <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> but, badly damaged, she sank at sea.|$|E
50|$|Later in the day, as <b>the</b> troops moved <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> {{and secured}} their objectives, she got {{underway}} {{to return to}} Leyte, where she prepared for her next invasion, Lingayen Gulf, on Luzon.|$|R
5|$|There are no snakes, no highly venomous or {{stinging}} insects, {{animals or}} plants, and no dangerous daytime sharks <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches.</b> Although {{there are reports}} of tiger sharks on the cliff side of the island.|$|R
50|$|Tryon {{embarked}} 1,323 Marines of the 1st Marine Division and sortied on 8 September 1944, with Transport Division 6 of Task Force 32, for {{the assault}} on the Palaus. She was <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> of Peleliu {{on the morning of the}} 15th and disembarked elements of the assault wave. Then, serving as a hospital evacuation ship, she embarked 812 combat casualties and, on the 20th, stood out for Manus. She disembarked the patients at Seeadler Harbor four days later and headed back to Peleliu the next morning. <b>The</b> ship remained <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> from 28 September to 4 October and then joined a convoy bound for the Solomons.|$|R
5|$|The second wave, {{scheduled}} for 06:35, consisted of 32 LCVPs carrying four more companies of 8th Infantry, {{as well as}} combat engineers and naval demolition teams that were to clear the beach of obstacles. The third wave, {{scheduled for}} 06:45, consisted of eight LCTs bringing more DD tanks plus armored bulldozers to assist in clearing paths <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach.</b> It was to be followed at 06:37 by the fourth wave, which had eight Landing Craft Mechanized (LCM) and three LCVPs with detachments of the 237th and 299th Combat Engineer Battalions, assigned to clear the beach between {{the high and low}} water marks.|$|E
5|$|Casualties {{were around}} 2,000, {{as the men}} were {{subjected}} to fire from the cliffs above. Problems clearing the beach of obstructions led to the beachmaster calling a halt to further landings of vehicles at 08:30. A group of destroyers arrived around this time to provide fire support so landings could resume. Exit from the beach was possible only via five heavily defended gullies, and by late morning barely 600 men had reached the higher ground. By noon, as the artillery fire took its toll and the Germans started {{to run out of}} ammunition, the Americans were able to clear some lanes on the beaches. They also started clearing the gullies of enemy defences so that vehicles could move <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach.</b> The tenuous beachhead was expanded over the following days, and the D-Day objectives for Omaha were accomplished by D+3.|$|E
5|$|The {{coastline}} of Normandy {{was divided}} into seventeen sectors, with codenames using a spelling alphabet—from Able, west of Omaha, to Roger on the east flank of Sword. Eight further sectors were added when the invasion was extended to include Utah. Sectors were further subdivided into beaches identified by the colors Green, Red, and White. Utah, the westernmost of the five landing beaches, is on the Cotentin Peninsula, west of the mouths of the Douve and Vire rivers. The terrain between Utah and the neighboring Omaha was swampy and difficult to cross, which meant that the troops landing at Utah would be isolated. The Germans had flooded the farmland behind Utah, restricting travel <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> to a few narrow causeways. To help secure the terrain inland of the landing zone, rapidly seal off the Cotentin Peninsula, and prevent the Germans from reinforcing the port at Cherbourg, two airborne divisions were assigned to airdrop into German territory {{in the early hours}} of the invasion.|$|E
50|$|Eleven days later, Sands {{returned}} to New Britain for another assault landing. On the 26th, she landed marines on Cape Gloucester, provided gunfire support {{as they moved}} <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches,</b> then retired to stage for her next target, Saidor.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{transport}} remained <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> until <b>the</b> 24th {{when she}} sailed to Eniwetok and Pearl Harbor. Before leaving Saipan, she had sent more supplies {{and equipment to}} Blue Beach One, treated wounded direct from <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> and, prior to sailing, received on board an additional 85 battle casualties from LST-218.|$|R
50|$|On {{her first}} trip, {{she was used}} to ferry {{soldiers}} <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> to larger ships waiting offshore. She was badly damaged by machine gun fire and a rope became wrapped around her propeller. She was towed back to England stern first.|$|R
5|$|There was {{resistance}} from the air, though. As the fifth wave of seven LCIs was coming in to Red Beach, they were attacked by six Zeke fighters and three Betty bombers that dropped twelve bombs. One hit the deck of USS LCI-339 forward of the conning tower; another two were near misses. Badly damaged and riddled by bullets and fragments, the ship caught fire. LCI-339 remained on the beach, where she served as a landmark for Japanese aircraft. She was eventually towed <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> but then drifted onto a reef and became a total loss. USS LCI-341 suffered a near miss that tore a huge hole in its side. Eight Australians were killed, including Lieutenant Colonel R. E. Wall, the commanding officer of the 2/23rd Infantry Battalion, and 45 were wounded.|$|E
5|$|Very little went {{as planned}} during the landing at Omaha. Difficulties in {{navigation}} caused {{the majority of}} landing craft to miss their targets throughout the day. The defenses were unexpectedly strong, and inflicted heavy casualties on landing U.S. troops. Under heavy fire, the engineers struggled to clear the beach obstacles; later landings bunched up around the few channels that were cleared. Weakened by the casualties taken just in landing, the surviving assault troops could not clear the heavily defended exits <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach.</b> This caused further problems and consequent delays for later landings. Small penetrations were eventually achieved by groups of survivors making improvised assaults, scaling the bluffs between the most heavily defended points. By {{the end of the}} day, two small isolated footholds had been won, which were subsequently exploited against weaker defenses further inland, thus achieving the original D-Day objectives over the following days.|$|E
5|$|Omaha, {{the most}} heavily defended sector, was {{assigned}} to the U.S. 1st Infantry Division, supplemented by troops from the U.S. 29th Infantry Division. They faced the 352nd Infantry Division, rather than the expected single regiment. Strong currents forced many landing craft east of their intended position or delayed them. Casualties were heavier than all the other landings combined, as the men were subjected to fire from the cliffs above. Problems clearing the beach of obstructions led to the beachmaster calling a halt to further landings of vehicles at 08:30. A group of destroyers arrived around this time to offer supporting artillery fire. Exit from Omaha was possible only via five gullies, and by late morning barely six hundred men had reached the higher ground. By noon, as the artillery fire took its toll and the Germans started to run out of ammunition, the Americans were able to clear some lanes on the beaches. They also started clearing the draws of enemy defences so that vehicles could move <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach.</b> The tenuous beachhead was expanded over the following days, and the D-Day objectives were accomplished by D+3.|$|E

2500|$|More {{than a dozen}} LCAs {{were used}} in {{evacuating}} the BEF from Dunkirk (Operation Dynamo). Eight LCAs were sent to Dunkirk on a merchant ship, SS Clan MacAlister. Designed to be hoisted on the standard passenger liner davits used for the 99 man lifeboats, the LCA could be carried and launched from {{a large number of}} Merchant Navy vessels. Clan MacAlister began hoisting out LCAs upon arriving off Dunkirk, 29 May, but was attacked and sunk before releasing half the craft. Five LCAs were lost with Clan MacAlister. The remaining eight began taking soldiers <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> at La Panne and Dunkirk. One became stranded on <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> and was set afire by its crew. The balance returned to England [...] "in a bad way" [...] after taking some 2,000 soldiers directly <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches.</b>|$|R
5|$|Reinforcement regiments {{were due}} to land by battalion, {{beginning}} with the 18th RCT at 09:30 on Easy Red. The first battalion to land, 2/18, arrived at the E-1 draw 30 minutes late after a difficult passage through the congestion off shore. Casualties were light, though. Despite {{the existence of a}} narrow channel through the beach obstacles, the ramps and mines there accounted for the loss 22 LCVPs, 2 LCI(L)s and 4 LCTs. Supported by tank and subsequent naval fire, the newly arrived troops took the surrender at 11:30 of the last strong-point defending the entrance to the E-1 draw. Although a usable exit was finally opened, congestion prevented an early exploitation inland. The three battalions of the 115th RCT, scheduled to land from 10:30 on Dog Red and Easy Green, came in together and on top of the 18th RCT landings at Easy Red. The confusion prevented the remaining two battalions of the 18th RCT from landing until 13:00, and delayed the move <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> of all but 2/18, which had exited the beach further east before noon, until 14:00. Even then, this movement was hampered by mines and enemy positions still in action further up the draw.|$|E
5|$|Specialised armour {{arriving}} in the first wave included AVREs, mine flails, and armoured bulldozers. Clearing paths <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> proved difficult, as the tanks got stuck in the mud or were taken out by mines. A lone mine flail tank finally cleared a path from the beach up toward the Mont Fleury Battery and Ver-Sur-Mer. This route {{was used by the}} Green Howards and tanks of the 4th/7th Dragoon Guards, who cleared the remaining resistance at the Mont Fleury Battery. B Company moved on to attack trench positions and machine gun emplacements at Meuvaines Ridge, while C Company moved to the west of Ver-Sur-Mer to help cover the assault on Crépon, where roads led to the important targets of Bayeux and Caen. The 7th Green Howards attacked the gun battery at Ver-Sur-Mer, where they took 50 prisoners. Colour Sergeant-Major Stanley Hollis earned the only Victoria Cross to be bestowed for actions on D-Day. On the way to the Mont Fleury Battery, Hollis came under machine gun fire while investigating a pillbox, so he shot into the entrance with his Sten gun and dropped a grenade through the roof, killing most of the occupants. He cleared a nearby trench of enemy soldiers, whereupon the occupants of a second pillbox surrendered. Later in the day, he saved the lives of three men during an attempt to take out a field artillery installation at a farm near Crépon.|$|E
5|$|While {{the coastal}} {{defenses}} had not turned back the invasion at the beach, they {{had broken up}} and weakened the assault formations struggling through them. The German emphasis on this Main Line of Resistance (MLR) meant that defenses further inland were significantly weaker, and based on small pockets of prepared positions smaller than company sized in strength. This tactic was enough to disrupt American advances inland, making it difficult even to reach the assembly areas, let alone achieve their D-Day objectives. As {{an example of the}} effectiveness of German defenses despite weakness in numbers, the 5th Ranger battalion was halted in its advance inland by a single machine gun position hidden in a hedgerow. One platoon attempted to outflank the position, only to run into another machine gun position {{to the left of the}} first. A second platoon dispatched to take this new position ran into a third, and attempts to deal with this met with fire from a fourth position. The success of the MLR in blocking the movement of heavy weapons <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> meant that, after four hours, the Rangers were forced to give up on attempts to move them any further inland.|$|E
