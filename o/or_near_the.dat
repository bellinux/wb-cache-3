40|$|Description The target {{equivalence}} range (TEQR) {{design is}} a frequentist {{implementation of the}} modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) design and a competitor to the standard 3 + 3 design (3 + 3). The 3 + 3 is the work horse design in Phase I. It is good at determining if a safe dose exits, but provides poor accuracy and precision in estimating the level of toxicity at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The TEQR {{is better than the}} 3 + 3 when compared on: 1) the number of times <b>the</b> dose at <b>or</b> <b>nearest</b> <b>the</b> target toxicity level was selected as the MTD, 2) the number of subjects assigned to doses levels, at <b>or</b> <b>nearest</b> <b>the</b> MTD, and 3) the overall trial DLT rate. TEQR more accurately and more precisely estimates the rate of toxicity at the MTD because a larger number of subjects are studied at the MTD dose. The TEQR on average uses fewer subjects and provide reasonably comparable results to the continual reassessment method (CRM) in the number of times <b>the</b> dose at <b>or</b> <b>nearest</b> <b>the</b> target toxicity level was selected as the MTD and the number of subjects assigned doses, at, <b>or</b> <b>nearest</b> <b>the</b> target and in overall DLT rate...|$|R

50|$|Coil noise {{can occur}} when the coil is poorly secured to the circuit board or is poorly damped. The effect is more {{pronounced}} as the signal passing through the coil increases in strength <b>or</b> <b>nears</b> <b>the</b> (mechanical) resonant frequency of the coil.|$|R

5|$|After the Battle of Vukovar, the JNA and its {{allied forces}} started taking all civilians {{remaining}} in Vukovar to the Velepromet camp, transferring them from various shelters {{elsewhere in the}} city. About 11:00 on 19 November, Cyrus Vance and Herbert S. Okun toured Vukovar on a United Nations fact-finding mission. They were given an escorted tour of several sites in <b>or</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> city, including the Velepromet camp, before departing for Belgrade at 13:00.|$|E
5|$|Capital Bikeshare {{has grown}} steadily, which has driven {{demand for more}} {{stations}} and bikes. Transportation agencies in each jurisdiction select {{the location of the}} rental stations, as well as the number of bike docks, depending on planners' estimates of local demand.

5|$|Damage to DNA {{alters the}} spatial {{configuration}} of the helix, and such alterations can be detected by the cell.

The existence of such allotropes can complicate the classification of the elements involved.|$|E
5|$|Early federal {{plans for}} a {{nationwide}} system of interregional highways {{did not include a}} route along <b>or</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> present turnpike, instead connecting Oklahoma City and Kansas City via southeastern Kansas and U.S. Route 69. By the mid-1940s, this route had shifted to roughly the present Interstate 35 alignment, serving Wichita. The only major difference from the present route was between Wichita and Emporia, where the highway ran north to Newton before turning northeast along U.S. Route 50.|$|E
5|$|In 1983 the Rocky Mountain Peace and Justice Center {{was founded}} {{with a goal}} of closing the Rocky Flats plant.

5|$|Models of how Siletzia formed are of {{two general}} types: (1) Formation well {{offshore}} (possibly as seamounts, like the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain, or a hotspot at a spreading ridge, like Iceland) and then accretion to the continent; (2) formation inshore, on <b>or</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> continental margin (perhaps {{as a result}} of transcurrent extension, or of a slab window). All current models then have Siletzia rifting away from the continental edge about a northern pivot.|$|E
