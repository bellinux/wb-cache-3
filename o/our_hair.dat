The track begins with just a guitar, {{featuring}} an echo effect, playing the descending notes C, B, A, G, F, E, D and G before the band join on 13 seconds with the bridge during which Gruff Rhys sings the word [...] "why" [...] several times in a falsetto voice, accompanied by strings arranged by Sonia Slay and the group. The first verse follows on 38 seconds with Rhys accompanied by a basic 4/4 beat provided by drummer Dafydd Ieuan, sparse bass guitar and a melody line played by Huw Bunford on guitar. The first chorus enters at 1 minute 4 seconds with Rhys singing the words [...] "as <b>our</b> <b>hair</b> turns white, all the stars still shine so bright above, at least it's {{not the end of the}} world" [...] while Bunford plays a guitar counter-melody. Another bridge and verse follow before the second chorus appears at 2 minutes 2 seconds with Rhys this time singing [...] "as <b>our</b> <b>hair</b> turns grey everything is far from A-A-A-ok". The outro begins at 2 minute 23 seconds, with the chorus repeating before the bridge plays through several times, ending on a C chord.|$|E
500|$|Julian Symons, {{writing in}} The Times Literary Supplement, found Moonraker [...] "a disappointment", and {{considered}} that [...] "Fleming's tendency... to parody {{the form of}} the thriller, has taken charge {{in the second half of}} this story." [...] Maurice Richardson, in his review for The Observer, was more welcoming: [...] "Do not miss this", he urged, saying that [...] "Mr. Fleming continues to be irresistibly readable, however incredible". Hilary Corke, writing in The Listener, thought that [...] "Fleming is one of the most accomplished of thriller-writers", and considered that Moonraker [...] "is as mercilessly readable as all the rest". Corke warned Fleming away from being over-dramatic, declaring that [...] "Mr Fleming is evidently far too accomplished to need to lean upon these blood-and-thunder devices: he could keep <b>our</b> <b>hair</b> on end for three hundred pages without spilling more blood than was allowed to Shylock." [...] The reviewer in The Scotsman considered that Fleming [...] "administers stimuli with no mean hand... 'Astonish me!' the addict may challenge: Mr Fleming can knock him sideways." ...|$|E
500|$|Rado {{described}} {{the inspiration for}} Hair as [...] "a combination of some characters we met in the streets, people we knew and our own imaginations. [...] We knew this group of kids in the East Village who were dropping out and dodging the draft, and there were also lots of articles in the press about how kids were being kicked {{out of school for}} growing their hair long". [...] He recalled, [...] "There was so much excitement in the streets and the parks and the hippie areas, and we thought if we could transmit this excitement to the stage it would be wonderful.... We hung out with them and went to their Be-Ins [...] let <b>our</b> <b>hair</b> grow." [...] Many cast members (Shelley Plimpton in particular) were recruited right off the street. [...] Rado said, [...] "It was very important historically, and if we hadn't written it, there'd not be any examples. [...] You could read about it and see film clips, but you'd never experience it. [...] We thought, 'This is happening in the streets,' and we wanted to bring it to the stage." ...|$|E

500|$|The TPF {{formed a}} phalanx and {{attempted}} to clear the streets by marching slowly and pushing the crowd back. The mob openly mocked the police. The crowd cheered, started impromptu kick lines, and sang {{to the tune of}} Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay: [...] "We are the Stonewall girls/ We wear <b>our</b> <b>hair</b> in curls/ We don't wear underwear/ We show our pubic hair." [...] Lucian Truscott reported in The Village Voice: [...] "A stagnant situation there brought on some gay tomfoolery {{in the form of a}} chorus line facing the line of helmeted and club-carrying cops. Just as the line got into a full kick routine, the TPF advanced again and cleared the crowd of screaming gay powerites down Christopher to Seventh Avenue." [...] One participant who had been in the Stonewall during the raid recalled, [...] "The police rushed us, and that's when I realized this is not a good thing to do, because they got me in the back with a nightstick." [...] Another account stated, [...] "I just can't ever get that one sight out of my mind. The cops with the [...] and the kick line on the other side. It was the most amazing thing... And all the sudden that kick line, which I guess was a spoof on the machismo... I think that's when I felt rage. Because people were getting smashed with bats. And for what? A kick line." ...|$|E

When we look back on those 40 years and remember that Sinn Féin won out, {{is it not a}} sad commentary on the policy which our young minds then grasped with enthusiasm to find that in this country which we got free of debt 20 short years ago—these 20 years have greyed <b>our</b> <b>hairs</b> and wrinkled <b>our</b> faces but they represent a short {{time in the history of}} a nation —we have piled up a debt of £111,000,000? …...

500|$|Kirk Miller of Decibel {{praised the}} band {{for the effort}} in [...] {{synchronised}} song structures. When asked of their views on their looks, members of the band have stated {{that they would not}} change their sound or image for a commercial approach; Tuck also said, [...] "Without sounding harsh, we're more interested in what our music sounds like than what <b>our</b> fucking <b>hair</b> looks like." ...|$|R

40|$|Human hair {{modeling}} is {{a difficult}} task. This paper presents a constructive hair modeling system with which users can sculpt {{a wide variety of}} hairstyles. <b>Our</b> Multiresolution <b>Hair</b> Modeling (MHM) system is based on the observed tendency of adjacent hair strands to form clusters at multiple scales due to static attraction. In <b>our</b> system, initial <b>hair</b> designs are quickly created with a small set of hair clusters. Refinements at finer levels are achieved by subdividing these initial hair clusters. Users can edit an evolving model at any level of detail, down to a single hair strand. High level editing tools support curling, scaling, and copy/paste, enabling users to rapidly create widely varying hairstyles. Editing ease and model realism are enhanced by efficient hair rendering, shading, antialiasing, and shadowing algorithms...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the characteristics of}} flow sensors, a suitable source for flow generation is required. We discuss three different sources for oscillating air flow, by considering their acoustic impedance, frequency range, velocity and ability to distinguish between flow and pressure.

40|$|AbstractFlow sensor arrays {{can be used}} {{to extract}} spatio-temporal flow {{signatures}} rather than average or local flow quantities. We look at the equivalent of a fish lateral-line sensor array in air and assess the ability of <b>our</b> artificial <b>hairs</b> flow-sensor arrays to detect flow velocity distributions generated by a vibrating sphere. The measured flow patterns along a virtual lateral-line, carried out over a bandwidth of 0. 3  Hz, are found to be in excellent agreement with theory and are used successfully to demonstrate source-distance determination...|$|R

The [...] "poetry of doubt," [...] however pretty, would stand us in little stead if we were threatened with a second Armada.

[...] What gospel there can be in such a message to any honest man who has either to till the earth, plan a railroad, colonise Australia, or fight his country's enemies, is hard to discover.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{overview}} of improvements in detection limit and responsivity of <b>our</b> biomimetic <b>hair</b> flow sensors by electrostatic spring-softening (ESS). Applying a DC-bias voltage to our capacitive flow sensors improves the responsively by up to 80 % for flow signals at frequencies below the sensor’s resonance. Application of frequency matched AC-bias voltages allows for tunable filtering and selective gain up to 20 dB. Furthermore, the quality and fidelity of low frequency flow measurements can be improved using a non frequency-matched AC-bias voltage, resulting in a flow detection limit down to 5 mm/s at low (30 Hz) frequencies. The merits and applicability of the three methods are discussed...|$|R
