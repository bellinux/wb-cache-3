5|$|In 1757, Lembi Battery, an outwork of Fort Manoel, {{was built}} on the {{northern}} shore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>peninsula.</b> A bastioned entrenchment was proposed in the early 1760s, but it was never built.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, {{the northeastern}} portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>peninsula</b> is characterised by forested swamplands. The {{northern}} portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>peninsula</b> lacks rivers, {{except for the}} Champotón River – all other rivers {{are located in the}} south. The Sibun River flows from west to east from south central Quintana Roo to Lake Bacalar on the Caribbean Coast; the Río Hondo flows northwards from Belize to empty into the same lake. Bacalar Lake empties into Chetumal Bay. The Río Nuevo flows from Lamanai Lake in Belize northwards to Chetumal Bay. The Mopan River and the Macal River flow through Belize and join to form the Belize River, which empties into the Caribbean Sea. In the southwest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>peninsula,</b> the San Pedro River, the Candelaría River and the Mamantel River, which all form a part of the Gulf of Mexico drainage.|$|E

25|$|In 1800, <b>the</b> western half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lower <b>Peninsula</b> {{and most}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Upper <b>Peninsula</b> were {{attached}} to the Indiana Territory when it was established as a separate government from the Northwest Territory.

5|$|Over the years, Rome had {{expanded}} {{along the southern}} Iberian coast until in 211 BC it captured the city of Saguntum. Following two major military expeditions to Iberia, the Romans finally crushed Carthaginian control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>peninsula</b> in 206 BC, at the Battle of Ilipa, and the peninsula became a Roman province known as Hispania. From 206 BC onwards the only opposition to Roman control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>peninsula</b> came from within the native Celtiberian tribes themselves, whose disunity prevented their security from Roman expansion.|$|E

5|$|The Yucatán Peninsula is {{bordered by}} the Caribbean Sea {{to the east}} and by the Gulf of Mexico to the north and west. It {{incorporates}} the modern Mexican states of Yucatán, Quintana Roo and Campeche, the eastern portion of the state of Tabasco, most of the Guatemalan department of Petén, and all of Belize. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>peninsula</b> is formed by a vast plain with few hills or mountains and a generally low coastline. The northwestern and northern portions of the Yucatán Peninsula experience lower rainfall {{than the rest of the}} peninsula; these regions feature highly porous limestone bedrock resulting in less surface water. In contrast, the northeastern portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>peninsula</b> is characterised by forested swamplands. The northern portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>peninsula</b> lacks rivers, except for the Champotón River – all other rivers are located in the south.|$|E

Chanputun (modern Champotón) was on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, as was Acalan. In the southern portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>peninsula,</b> a number of polities occupied the Petén Basin. The Kejache occupied a territory between the Petén lakes and what is now Campeche. The Cholan Maya-speaking Lakandon (not {{to be confused with the}} modern inhabitants of Chiapas by that name) controlled territory along the tributaries of the Usumacinta River spanning eastern Chiapas and southwestern Petén.

5|$|Despite the {{economic}} activity, permanent settlement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>peninsula</b> did not intensify until the 1860s {{and even then}} it remained sporadic until 1917. The population of Kola in 1880, for example, was only around 500inhabitants living in 80households, compared to 1,900inhabitants in 300households living there in 1582. Transportation facilities were virtually non-existent and the communication {{with the rest of}} Russia irregular. 1887 saw an influx of Izhma Komi and Nenets people who were migrating to the peninsula to escape a reindeer disease epidemic in their home lands and brought their large deer herds with them, resulting in increased competition for the grazing lands, a conflict between the Komi and the Sami, and in marginalization of the local Sami population.

Louis Zistel, a German immigrant, built two boats to transport the prisoners. In 1870, he began to ferry locals to the Cedar Point peninsula, which was regaining popularity as a summer picnic destination. Zistel opened a bathhouse {{on the north shore}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>peninsula</b> and the same year built a beer garden with a small dance floor.
