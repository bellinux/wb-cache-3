30|$|Herein, we {{have used}} a matrix of 16 {{electrodes}} to improve the classification accuracy of recorded uterine electrical activity. The first point that emerges is that, although there was a correlation between the electrical activities recorded at different sites, the characteristics of the recorded signal depended on the position of the recording electrode. The results revealed first that the classification performance varied from one channel to another. One possible explanation of this observable fact is that the characteristics of the uterine electrical activity are influenced by the position of the recording electrode: on the one hand, the distance between the recording position on the skin and the signal source in the myometrium is reduced at the median axis with respect to other electrodes [3, 39, 40]. There are more visceral tissues between the skin and the uterus at the extremities than on the middle of the median axis of woman’s abdomen [40]. On the other hand, in the region surrounding the median axis, the position of the uterus relative to the abdominal wall is constant even during contraction [3]. It was demonstrated thereafter that the main effect of the electrode position, in terms of tissues depth below the recording site and distance of electrodes to the potentials source, concerns the attenuation of the high frequencies which creates a strong attenuation of the signal energy [3] which explains the rise of the high-frequency content of the action potentials throughout pregnancy and at the onset of labor reported in many studies [1, 24]. Therefore, the difference of the features values between the two classes is less significant at the median axis compared to other channels located at the extremities of the recording matrix. Therefore, electrodes positioned on the extremities are more sensible to these variations than the channels located {{at the center of the}} matrix and had more influence on the decision making than the ones positioned <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>median</b> <b>axis.</b> As a result, when a decision fusion rule was applied, an improved accuracy of the classification decision compared to a decision based on any of the individual data sources alone was obtained. Furthermore, based on the fact that there was variability between the classification accuracies of the different channels, a decision fusion rule based on the WMV may be more convenient for combining the decisions than other rules such as the majority voting as concluded in [41]. It is important also to note that, due to the complexity of the analyzed data, a SVM classifier with a RBF kernel which is known to be a strong classifier should be used as the component classifier of the network. When tested on the same data, SVM classifier with a RBF kernel yielded better classification results than a neural network of the same kernel function [18, 41].|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{recent past}} {{years have seen}} a {{noticeable}} increase {{of interest in the}} correlation analysis of electrohysterographic (EHG) signals in the perspective of improving the pregnancy monitoring. Here we propose a new approach based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> functional connectivity between multichannel (4 x 4 matrix) EHG signals recorded from the women's abdomen.

The method was evaluated on a dataset of EHGs, in order to track the correlation between EHGs collected by each electrode of the matrix (called 'node-wise' analysis) and follow their evolution along weeks before labor. Results showed that the strength of each node significantly increases from pregnancy to labor. Electrodes located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>median</b> vertical <b>axis</b> of <b>the</b> uterus seemed to be the more discriminant.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{three-dimensional}} {{analysis of a}} sample of 22 859 type $ab$ RR Lyrae stars in the Magellanic System from the OGLE-IV Collection of RR Lyrae stars. The distance to each object was calculated based on its photometric metallicity and a theoretical relation between color, absolute magnitude and metallicity. The LMC RR Lyrae distribution is very regular and does not show any substructures. We demonstrate that the bar found in previous studies may be an overdensity caused by blending and crowding effects. The halo is asymmetrical with a higher stellar density in its north-eastern area, which is also located closer to us. Triaxial ellipsoids were fitted to surfaces of a constant number density. Ellipsoids farther from the LMC center are less elongated and slightly rotated toward the SMC. The inclination and position angle change significantly with the $a$ <b>axis</b> size. <b>The</b> <b>median</b> <b>axis</b> ratio is $ 1 : 1. 23 : 1. 45 $. The RR Lyrae distribution in the SMC has a very regular, ellipsoidal shape and does not show any substructures or asymmetries. All triaxial ellipsoids fitted to surfaces of a constant number density have virtually the same shape (axis ratio) and are elongated {{along the line of}} sight. <b>The</b> <b>median</b> <b>axis</b> ratio is $ 1 : 1. 10 : 2. 13 $. The inclination angle is very small and thus the position angle is not well defined. We present the distribution of RR Lyrae stars in the Magellanic Bridge area, showing that the Magellanic Clouds' halos overlap. A comparison of the distributions of RR Lyrae stars and Classical Cepheids shows that the former are significantly more spread and distributed regularly, while the latter are very clumped and form several distinct substructures.

40|$|Abstract — Systematic {{mapping of}} the {{variability}} in cortical sulcal anatomy {{is an area of}} increasing interest which presents numerous methodological challenges. To address these issues, we have implemented sulcal extraction and assisted labeling (SEAL) to automatically extract the two-dimensional (2 -D) surface ribbons that represent <b>the</b> <b>median</b> <b>axis</b> of cerebral sulci and to neuroanatomically label these entities. To encode the extracted three-dimensional (3 -D) cortical sulcal schematic topography (CSST) we define a relational graph structure composed of two main features: vertices (representing sulci) and arcs (representing the relationships between sulci). Vertices contain a parametric representation of the surface ribbon buried within <b>the</b> sulcus. Points <b>on</b> this surface are expressed in stereotaxic coordinates (i. e., with respect to a standardized brain coordinate system). For each of these vertices, we stor...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThere is {{increasing}} evidence that animal morphogenesis {{consists of a}} large scale tissue flow, which defines the gross characteristics of the animal body {{at a very early}} developmental stage. We have studied the vertebrate embryo cell trajectories between a moment when it is flat and formless, to a moment when the body plan is recognizable (chicken embryo days 2 - 3 of development).
