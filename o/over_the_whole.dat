CBC is not used <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> disk; it is applied to each individual sector.|$|E

5|$|The outer {{electron}} configuration of darmstadtium is calculated to be 6d87s2, which obeys the Aufbau principle {{and does not}} follow platinum's outer {{electron configuration}} of 5d96s1.

The King of the Scots massed an army on the Northumberland's border, to which the English responded by gathering an army at Newcastle. Once more pitched battle was avoided, and instead a truce was agreed until December. When December fell, David demanded that Stephen hand <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> of the old earldom of Northumberland. Stephen's refusal led to David's third invasion, this time in January 1138.|$|E

This building program culminated {{in the construction of the}} last pyramid built by native Egyptian rulers. Ahmose's reign laid the foundations for the New Kingdom, under which Egyptian power reached its peak. His reign is usually dated to the mid-16th century BC.|$|E
