5|$|The UK Singles Chart is a music chart {{compiled}} by the Official Charts Company that calculates the best-selling singles of the week in the United Kingdom. Since 2005, the chart {{has been based on}} the sales of both physical and digital singles, originally on the condition that the single was available in both formats. In 2007, the rules were changed so that legal downloads of all songs, irrespective <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> physical copy was available, were eligible to chart.|$|E
5|$|A country's {{external}} {{wealth is}} measured by the value of its foreign assets net of its foreign liabilities. A current account surplus (and corresponding financial account deficit) indicates an increase in external wealth while a deficit indicates a decrease. Aside from current account indications <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> country is a net buyer or net seller of assets, shifts in a nation's external wealth are influenced by capital gains and capital losses on foreign investments. Having positive external wealth means a country is a net lender (or creditor) in the world economy, while negative external wealth indicates a net borrower (or debtor).|$|E
5|$|Not every {{question}} or every criminal case was {{eligible for a}} certificate of division. In United States v. Daniel (1821), the Court held that a motion for a new trialas authorized by the § 17 of the Judiciary Act of 1789could not {{be the subject of}} a certificate of division; rather, the division would operate a rejection of the motion. Similarly, in United States v. Bailey (1835), the Court held that {{the question of whether the}} evidence was legally sufficient to support the offense charged could not be certified. In United States v. Briggs (Briggs I) (1847), the Court further limited its jurisdiction to hear criminal certificates of division by holding that the question <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> demurrer to an indictment should be sustained was to general to be certified.|$|E
5000|$|The Court {{went on to}} {{say that}} Coker FM had treated the {{question}} <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>an</b> equal time arrangement was in M's best interests [...] "as determinative <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>an</b> order should be made", and that he had failed to consider reasonable practicability.|$|R
5000|$|Anticipatory Self-Appraisal: Simply put, this {{analysis}} of alternatives requires <b>an</b> internal reflection <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>an</b> administrator feels that an alternative fits within {{what he or}} she perceives to be their own personality. This is <b>an</b> examination <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>an</b> alternative will meet our need to feel satisfied with the decision.|$|R

5|$|To {{remedy the}} causes of the fire, changes were made in the Block II {{spacecraft}} and operational procedures, the most important of which were use of a nitrogen/oxygen mixture instead of pure oxygen before and during launch, and removal of flammable cabin and space suit materials. The Block II design already called for replacement of the Block I plug-type hatch cover with a quick-release, outward opening door. NASA discontinued the manned Block I program, using the Block I spacecraft only for unmanned Saturn V flights. Crew members would also exclusively wear modified, fire-resistant A7L Block II space suits, and would be designated by the Block II titles, regardless <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> LM was present on the flight or not.|$|E
5|$|When the {{question}} <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> person is {{alive or dead}} arises, and it is shown that he was alive within 30 years, the burden of proving {{that he or she}} is dead lies on the person who affirms it. However, if it is proved that he or she has not been heard of for seven years by those who would naturally have heard of the person if he or she had been alive, the burden of proving that the person is alive shifts to the person who affirms this.|$|E
5|$|While earlier cases {{expressed}} {{this stage}} of the test as a determination <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> law is discriminatory, the Court of Appeal has warned against the confusing of the concepts of differentiation and discrimination. A differentiating law is one that draws distinctions between groups of people. A discriminatory law or executive act, on the other hand, is one that contravenes Article 12(1) and hence is unconstitutional. Therefore, the mere finding of a differentiating measure in this first stage does not necessarily make the law discriminatory, as the other two stages will still have to be taken into consideration. If the impugned statute does not contain such a differentiating measure, it is a good law and the objection fails.|$|E

25|$|Clearly, the {{question}} <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> given x {{is a composite}} is equivalent to {{the question}} of whether x is a member of COMPOSITE. It can be shown that COMPOSITE ∈ NP by verifying that it satisfies the above definition (if we identify natural numbers with their binary representations).|$|E
25|$|The {{other method}} of {{amending}} the state constitution, {{and the one}} used for all amendments prior to 1998, is for the General Assembly {{to put on the}} ballot the question <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> limited constitutional convention should be called for the purpose of considering amendments to certain specified provisions of the constitution.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time that the presidential run was being considered, there was also some {{speculation}} that Bloomberg could be a candidate for the vice presidency in 2008. In a blog posting of June 21, 2007, Ben Smith of The Politico asked the question <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> vice-presidential candidate can self-finance an entire presidential ticket.|$|E
25|$|For example, in {{probability}} theory, integrals {{are used}} to determine the probability of some random variable falling within a certain range. Moreover, the integral under an entire probability density function must equal 1, which provides a test <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> function with no negative values could be a density function or not.|$|E
25|$|Unlike a total ouster clause {{which seeks}} to {{preclude}} judicial review entirely, a partial ouster clause specifies a restricted period of time after which no remedy will be available. However, if the issue <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> public authority has acted in bad faith arises, the authority's act or decision is not immune to judicial review notwithstanding the lapse of time.|$|E

25|$|In R. v. N.S., 2012 SCC 72, the Supreme Court {{sought to}} find a middle ground on the issue <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> witness can wear a face-covering niqab while testifying in a {{criminal}} trial. The court found {{that the right to}} religious freedom must be balanced against the right of the accused to a fair trial.|$|E
25|$|The term {{external}} affairs avoided the question <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> colony or Dominion—self-governing and hence sovereign in some respects—could, by definition, have foreign affairs. Implicitly, since {{the department was}} responsible for affairs with both Commonwealth and non-Commonwealth countries, all external relations were of a type, even when {{the head of state}} was shared with other nations.|$|E

25|$|Suffrage {{is often}} {{conceived}} {{in terms of}} elections for representatives. However, suffrage applies equally to referenda and initiatives. Suffrage describes not only {{the legal right to}} vote, but also the practical question <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> question will be put to a vote. The utility of suffrage is reduced when important questions are decided unilaterally by elected or non-elected representatives.|$|E
25|$|Prediction {{intervals}} {{are commonly}} used as definitions of reference ranges, such as reference ranges for blood tests to give an idea <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> blood test is normal or not. For this purpose, {{the most commonly used}} prediction interval is the 95% prediction interval, and a reference range based on it can be called a standard reference range.|$|E
25|$|The {{district}} court agreed and dismissed the suit {{for lack of}} subject-matter jurisdiction and for Bivens's failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.
