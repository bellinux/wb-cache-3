5|$|Methylcyclopentadienyl {{manganese}} tricarbonyl {{is used as}} an additive in {{unleaded gasoline}} to boost <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> and reduce engine knocking. The manganese in this unusual organometallic compound is in the +1 oxidation state.|$|E
5|$|Methylcyclopentadienyl {{manganese}} tricarbonyl (MMT) is {{a gasoline}} additive used to replace lead compounds for unleaded gasolines {{to improve the}} <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> of low octane petroleum distillates. It reduces engine knock agent through {{the action of the}} carbonyl groups. Fuels containing manganese tend to form manganese carbides, which damage exhaust valves. The need for lead or manganese additives is merely historic because the modern reformation processes create fuels with increased octane ratings. Such fuels, directly or in mixture with non-reformed distillates, are universal in developed countries (0EU, Japan, etc.). In the USA, the imperative to provide the lowest price per volume on motor fuels and the lowest taxation rate, combined with lax legislation of fuel content before the year 2000, encouraged refineries to use MMT. Compared to 1953, levels of manganese in air have dropped. Many racing competitions specifically ban manganese compounds in racing fuel for carts and minibikes. MMT contains 24.4â€“25.2% manganese. Elevated atmospheric manganese concentrations are strongly correlated with automobile traffic density.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{aviation}} gasoline (avgas) is dyed to identify its <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> and to {{distinguish it from}} kerosene-based jet fuel, which is clear.|$|E

25|$|The {{characteristic}} of a particular gasoline blend to resist igniting too early (which causes knocking and reduces efficiency in reciprocating engines) is measured by its <b>octane</b> <b>rating.</b> Gasoline is produced in several grades of <b>octane</b> <b>rating.</b> Tetraethyllead and other lead compounds are no longer used in most areas to regulate and increase octane-rating, but many other additives are put into gasoline to improve its chemical stability, control corrosiveness and provide fuel system 'cleaning,' and determine performance characteristics under intended use. Sometimes, gasoline also contains ethanol as an alternative fuel, for economic, political or environmental reasons.|$|E
25|$|The {{product of}} the unit, the alkylate, is {{composed}} of a mixture of high-octane, branched-chain paraffinic hydrocarbons (mostly isoheptane and isooctane). Alkylate is a premium gasoline blending stock because it has exceptional antiknock properties and is clean burning. The octane number of the alkylate depends mainly upon the kind of alkenes used and upon operating conditions. For example, isooctane results from combining butylene with isobutane and has an <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> of 100 by definition. There are other products in the alkylate effluent, however, so the <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> will vary accordingly.|$|E
25|$|The {{power of}} the engine could also change {{according}} to the <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> of the aviation fuel being used. Higher octane fuels allowed boost pressures to be increased without the risks of pre-ignition or knocking.|$|E
50|$|The Eunos 800 was {{a luxury}} car from Mazda's Eunos marque in Japan. Sold only from 1993 through 1998, the Eunos 800 {{exported}} as the Xedos 9 {{and used the}} Mazda T platform. It was also sold as a Eunos 800 in Australia, as both the 800M, with the Miller Cycle engine and the base 800, with the 2.5 litre engine. Both engines are slightly derated compared to the Japanese spec engines, most likely because 95 octane fuel was the maximum <b>octane</b> <b>rated</b> fuel available in Australia at that time.|$|R
50|$|Note: Power {{ratings have}} changed due to SAE {{measurement}} changes for 2006 model year vehicles. Toyota rates engines on 87 pump <b>octane,</b> Lexus <b>rates</b> engines on 91 pump octane.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe <b>octane</b> number <b>rating</b> of a {{gasoline}} gives {{an indication of}} the gasoline performances, under various engine conditions. Two different ratings are included: Research Octane Number (RON) and Motor Octane Number (MON). The standard laboratory method for octane number determination is the knock engine method in which {{a gasoline}} is burned and its combustion characteristics compared to known standards. This method is time consuming and labor intensive, and provides no ability for real time control of production. NIR can be applied in real time directly in process monitoring or as a laboratory procedure. Near infrared spectra of gasoline samples were collected thanks to four different short wavelengths near infrared analysers, built with strictly the same technology. The aim {{of this study was to}} transfer the calibration built on one spectrometer to the other ones. We applied the external parameter orthogonali-sation (EPO) correction to get rid of the apparatus influence on information contained in spectra. By this method, we managed to improve prediction values of two major gasolines' properties, i. e. Research and Motor Octane Number...|$|R
25|$|The A40 {{featured}} single ignition {{until the}} A-40-5 version, which introduced dual ignition. All engines {{in this family}} have a 5.2:1 compression ratio and were designed to run on fuel with a minimum <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> of 73.|$|E
25|$|A fuel with {{a higher}} <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> is less prone to {{knocking}} (extremely rapid and spontaneous combustion by compression) and the control system of any modern car engine {{can take advantage of}} this by adjusting the ignition timing. This will improve energy efficiency, leading to a better fuel economy than the comparisons of energy content different fuels indicate. By increasing the compression ratio, further gains in fuel economy, power and torque can be achieved. Conversely, a fuel with lower <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> is more prone to knocking and will lower efficiency. Knocking can also cause engine damage. Engines designed to run on 87 octane will not have any additional power/fuel economy from being operated with higher octane fuel.|$|E
25|$|For {{technical}} reasons {{the use of}} leaded additives is still permitted worldwide for the formulation of some grades of aviation gasoline such as 100LL, because the required <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> would be technically infeasible to reach {{without the use of}} leaded additives.|$|E
50|$|OCZ-branded SSDs were {{notable for}} high failure rates. Two {{lines from the}} old OCZ Technology Group, the Petrol and the SATA II {{versions}} of the <b>Octane,</b> had return <b>rates</b> of over 40% at one anonymous French technology online retailer. The SATA II version of the 128 GB Octane had a return rate of 52.07%. No other company had any SSDs with a return rate of over 5% from this retailer in the data set that was published on March 5, 2013. In a dataset published on April 30, 2014, OCZ again had the highest return rates from the same anonymous retailer. The next dataset, published on November 6, 2014, shows only one OCZ drive, the OCZ Agility 3 480 GB, which had a much lower return rate of 1.34%.|$|R
25|$|Another {{important}} reason for removing sulfur from the naphtha streams within a petroleum refinery is that sulfur, even in extremely low concentrations, poisons the noble metal catalysts (platinum and rhenium) in the catalytic reforming units that are subsequently used to upgrade the <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> of the naphtha streams.|$|E
25|$|<b>Octane</b> <b>rating</b> is {{measured}} {{relative to a}} mixture of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane (an isomer of octane) and n-heptane. There are different conventions for expressing octane ratings, so the same physical fuel may have several different octane ratings based on the measure used. One {{of the best known}} is the research octane number (RON).|$|E
25|$|The <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> became {{important}} as the military sought higher output for aircraft engines in the late 1930s and the 1940s. A higher <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> allows a higher compression ratio or supercharger boost, and thus higher temperatures and pressures, which translate to higher power output. Some scientists even predicted that a nation with a good supply of high octane gasoline would have the advantage in air power. In 1943, the Rolls-Royce Merlin aero engine produced 1,320 horsepower (984kW) using 100 RON fuel from a modest 27 liter displacement. By the time of Operation Overlord during World War II both the RAF and USAAF were conducting some operations in Europe using 150 RON fuel (100/150 avgas), obtained by adding 2.5% aniline to 100 octane avgas. By this time the Rolls-Royce Merlin 66 was developing 2,000hp using this fuel.|$|E
25|$|Ammonia is {{sometimes}} proposed {{as a practical}} alternative to fossil fuel for internal combustion engines. Its high <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> of 120 and low flame temperature allows the use of high compression ratios without a penalty of high NOx production. Since ammonia contains no carbon, its combustion cannot produce carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons or soot.|$|E
25|$|Gasoline is {{produced}} in oil refineries. Roughly 19 US gallons (72 L) of gasoline is derived from a 42-gallon (159 L) barrel of crude oil. Material separated from crude oil via distillation, called virgin or straight-run gasoline, does not meet specifications for modern engines (particularly the <b>octane</b> <b>rating,</b> see below), but can be pooled to the gasoline blend.|$|E
25|$|E85, {{a mixture}} of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline, is {{generally}} the highest ethanol fuel mixture found in the United States and several European countries, particularly in Sweden, as this blend is the standard fuel for flexible-fuel vehicles. This mixture has an <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> of 94-97, which is significantly lower than pure ethanol, but still higher than normal gasoline (87-93 octane, depending on country).|$|E
25|$|The {{gasoline}} {{produced in}} the FCC unit has an elevated <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> but is less chemically stable compared to other gasoline components due to its olefinic profile. Olefins in gasoline {{are responsible for the}} formation of polymeric deposits in storage tanks, fuel ducts and injectors. The FCC LPG is an important source of C3-C4 olefins and isobutane that are essential feeds for the alkylation process and the production of polymers such as polypropylene.|$|E
25|$|Spark {{ignition}} {{engines are}} designed to burn gasoline in a controlled process called deflagration. However, the unburned mixture may autoignite by detonating from pressure and heat alone, rather than ignite from the spark plug at exactly the right time. This causes a rapid pressure rise which can damage the engine. This {{is often referred to}} as engine knocking or end-gas knock. Knocking can be reduced by increasing the gasoline's resistance to autoignition, which is expressed by its <b>octane</b> <b>rating.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the US it {{has been}} used in {{gasoline}} at low levels since 1979, replacing tetraethyl lead as an antiknock (<b>octane</b> <b>rating)</b> additive to prevent engine knocking. Oxygenates also help gasoline burn more completely, reducing tailpipe emissions from pre-1984 motor vehicles; dilute or displace gasoline components such as aromatics (e.g., benzene) and sulfur; and optimize oxidation during combustion. Before the introduction of other oxygenates and octane enhancers, most refiners had chosen MTBE primarily for its blending characteristics and low cost.|$|E
25|$|One of {{his first}} major {{research}} projects was {{on the problems of}} irregular combustion, known as knocking or pinging. To study the problem he built a unique variable-compression test engine. This {{led to the development of}} an <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> system for fuels, and considerable investment into octane improving additives and refining systems. The dramatic reduction in fuel use as a result of higher-octane fuel was directly responsible for allowing Alcock and Brown to fly the Atlantic in their Vickers Vimy bombers adapted with his modifications.|$|E
25|$|In the United States all {{motor vehicle}} {{gasoline}} is unleaded {{and is available}} in several grades with different octane rating; 87 (Regular), 89 (Mid-Grade), and 93 (Premium) are typical grades. The maximum <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> in California is generally 91. At high altitudes in the Mountain States and the Black Hills of South Dakota, regular unleaded can be as low as 85 octane; this practice is now increasingly controversial, since it was instituted when most cars had carburetors instead of the fuel injection and electronic engine controls standard in recent decades.|$|E
25|$|The second main {{option is}} to use {{hydrofluoric}} acid (HF) as catalyst. In typical alkylation plants, rates of consumption for acid are much lower than for sulfuric acid. The small amount of organofluorine side products are continuously removed from the reactor and the consumed HF is replenished. HF acid plants can process {{a wider range of}} feedstocks with propylenes and butylenes. These plants also produce alkylate with better <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> than do sulfuric plants. However, due to its hazardous nature, HF acid is produced at very few locations and transportation must be managed rigorously.|$|E
25|$|More {{volatile}} short-chain alkanes {{are also}} produced by and found in plant tissues. The Jeffrey pine is noted for producing exceptionally {{high levels of}} n-heptane in its resin, for which reason its distillate was designated as the zero point for one <b>octane</b> <b>rating.</b> Floral scents have also long been known to contain volatile alkane components, and n-nonane is a significant component in the scent of some roses. Emission of gaseous and volatile alkanes such as ethane, pentane, and hexane by plants has also been documented at low levels, though they are not {{generally considered to be}} a major component of biogenic air pollution.|$|E
25|$|From pentane to octane the alkanes {{are highly}} {{volatile}} liquids. They {{are used as}} fuels in internal combustion engines, as they vaporize easily on entry into the combustion chamber without forming droplets, which would impair the uniformity of the combustion. Branched-chain alkanes are preferred as they are much less prone to premature ignition, which causes knocking, than their straight-chain homologues. This propensity to premature ignition {{is measured by the}} <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> of the fuel, where 2,2,4-trimethylpentane (isooctane) has an arbitrary value of 100, and heptane has a value of zero. Apart from their use as fuels, the middle alkanes are also good solvents for nonpolar substances.|$|E
25|$|For E10 (10% ethanol and 90% gasoline), {{the effect}} is small (~3%) when {{compared}} to conventional gasoline, and even smaller (1â€“2%) when compared to oxygenated and reformulated blends. For E85 (85% ethanol), the effect becomes significant. E85 produces lower mileage than gasoline, and requires more frequent refueling. Actual performance may {{vary depending on the}} vehicle. Based on EPA tests for all 2006 E85 models, the average fuel economy for E85 vehicles resulted 25.56% lower than unleaded gasoline. The EPA-rated mileage of current United States flex-fuel vehicles should be considered when making price comparisons, but E85 is a high performance fuel, with an <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> of about 94â€“96, and should be compared to premium.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to repelling or killing insects such as moths and silverfish, mothballs {{can be used}} as a repellent to keep bats from establishing themselves in attics. Mothballs may repel snakes or mice. Mothballs have the potential to be a hazard to pets, livestock or children that may come into contact with them. Recent issues with imported and unregulated mothballs from China have also become a huge concern as there is no way to know what chemicals were used during the process. However, mothball labels instruct proper use in a sealed container. Older-formula mothballs have also been used by drag racers to enhance the <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> of fuel, by dissolving the mothballs in some of the fuel and filtering out the remains with a filter paper.|$|E
25|$|As a {{gasoline}} (petrol) additive, benzene increases the <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> and reduces knocking. As a consequence, gasoline often contained several percent benzene before the 1950s, when tetraethyl lead replaced {{it as the}} most widely used antiknock additive. With the global phaseout of leaded gasoline, benzene has made a comeback as {{a gasoline}} additive in some nations. In the United States, concern over its negative health effects and the possibility of benzene's entering the groundwater have led to stringent regulation of gasoline's benzene content, with limits typically around 1%. European petrol specifications now contain the same 1% limit on benzene content. The United States Environmental Protection Agency introduced new regulations in 2011 that lowered the benzene content in gasoline to 0.62%.|$|E
25|$|The <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> {{of typical}} commercially {{available}} gasoline varies by country. In Finland, Sweden, and Norway, 95 RON {{is the standard}} for regular unleaded gasoline and 98 RON is also available as a more expensive option. In the UK, ordinary regular unleaded gasoline is 95 RON (commonly available), premium unleaded gasoline is always 97 RON, and super unleaded is usually 97â€“98 RON. However, both Shell and BP produce fuel at 102 RON for cars with high-performance engines and in 2006 the supermarket chain Tesco began to sell super unleaded gasoline rated at 99 RON. In the US, octane ratings in unleaded fuels can vary between 85 and 87 AKI (91â€“92 RON) for regular, through 89â€“90 AKI (94â€“95 RON) for mid-grade (equivalent to European regular), up to 90â€“94 AKI (95â€“99 RON) for premium (European premium).|$|E
25|$|Because ethanol {{contains}} {{close to}} 34% less energy per unit volume than gasoline, E85 FFVs {{have a lower}} mileage per gallon than gasoline. However, this lower energy content does not translate directly into a 34% reduction in miles per U.S. gallon, {{because there are many}} other variables that affect the performance of a particular fuel in a particular engine, though for E85 the effect becomes significant. E85 will produce lower mileage than gasoline, and actual performance may vary depending on the vehicle. Based on EPA EPA-rated mileage for all 2006 E85 models, the average fuel economy for E85 vehicles was 25.56% lower than unleaded gasoline. When making price comparisons it has to be considered that E85 has <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> of about 104 and {{could be used as a}} substitute for premium gasoline.|$|E
25|$|A 2004 MIT {{study and}} an earlier paper {{published}} by the Society of Automotive Engineers identified a method to exploit the characteristics of fuel ethanol substantially more efficiently than mixing it with gasoline. The method presents the possibility of leveraging the use of alcohol to achieve definite improvement over the cost-effectiveness of hybrid electric. The improvement consists of using dual-fuel direct-injection of pure alcohol (or the azeotrope or E85) and gasoline, in any ratio up to 100% of either, in a turbocharged, high compression-ratio, small-displacement engine having performance similar to an engine having twice the displacement. Each fuel is carried separately, with a much smaller tank for alcohol. The high-compression (for higher efficiency) engine runs on ordinary gasoline under low-power cruise conditions. Alcohol is directly injected into the cylinders (and the gasoline injection simultaneously reduced) only when necessary to suppress â€˜knockâ€™ such as when significantly accelerating. Direct cylinder injection raises the already high <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> of ethanol up to an effective 130. The calculated over-all reduction of gasoline use and CO2 emission is 30%. The consumer cost payback time shows a 4:1 improvement over turbo-diesel and a 5:1 improvement over hybrid. The problems of water absorption into pre-mixed gasoline (causing phase separation), supply issues of multiple mix ratios and cold-weather starting are also avoided.|$|E
