The results indicate that breakaway oxidation occurs at 1090 °C for the B 443 NT steel, which is 60 °C lower than that for the B 445 J 1 M steel. The occurrence of iron oxide nodules on the steels marks the onset of breakaway oxidation; however, the breakaway oxidation phenomenon of B 445 J 1 M is different from that of B 443 NT due to a compact and continuous Mn-Cr spinel which is formed on the surface of B 445 J 1 M.

However, in the long- tested duration over 3, 000 h, the Cr-oxide thickness in the He environment was larger than in air.

40|$|Abstract. The cyclic and {{isothermal}} <b>oxidation</b> <b>behaviours</b> of stabilized and non-stabilized ferritic and {{austenitic stainless}} steels were compared. Ferritic grades exhibited parabolic kinetics in both oxidation conditions. The protectiveness of chromia scales was maintained owing primarily to a far faster Cr-supply rate than the Cr-consumption rate. Consequently, a constant and high enough interfacial Cr-content was noted and mechanical induced chemical failure (MICF) was avoided; although spallation of the oxide scale was observed during cyclic oxidation. Austenitic grades also exhibited parabolic kinetics during isothermal oxidation but a significant mass loss during cyclic oxidation due to spallation of nodular iron oxides. Actually, all the austenitic grades were sensitive to MICF because of their high values of kp/DCr implying interfacial Cr-content decreasing with oxidation time. Stabilizers (Ti, Nb) had no {{significant effect on the}} resistance of ferritic stainless steels to MICF; whereas, for the austenitics, Nb-addition enabled delay of the formation of iron oxides...|$|R

The peak oxidation rates in dry O 2 and View the MathML source were found to occur at temperatures of approximately 510 and 470 °C, respectively.

Ta doped r-TiO 2 formed (Ti 0. 95 Ta 0. 05) (3) SiC 2 during the oxidation process. Ta doping can limit the outward diffusion of Ti by decreasing the native Ti interstitials concentration and simultaneously restraining the inward diffusion of oxygen by decreasing the O vacancy concentration.

The phase composition of oxidized coatings were identified by the X-ray (ARL X’TRAX) diffractometer. Findings: The microstructures of zirconium-doped aluminide coatings consist of the β-NiAl, γ’-Ni 3 Al and γ-Ni(Al) phases. EDS analysis results of elements distribution indicate that zirconium is located at the distance of 13 - 16 µm from the surface after 1. 5 h of aluminizing and randomly distributed in the whole coating after 5 h of aluminizing. Zirconium (less than 1 % at) could contribute to a faster reduction of Al vacancies through fast diffusion towards the metal/oxide interface and increases adhesion of the oxide layer to the coating and this why the oxidation resistance improves.

40|$|The main {{industrial}} {{methods for}} the production of thin metal films are reviewed and the general qualities of the films compared. Physical vapour deposition produces the purest films on suitable substrates, and now has been investigated further for preparing nickel, chromium and nichrome films having the most reproducible electrical properties. A more precise determination of the crystal structure and reactivity of these films affords closer product control, so that the sintering of the films and their oxidation by oxygen, carbon dioxide or air has been studied by X-ray, optical and electronmicropgrapic and gas sorption techniques. Of the metal films vapour deposited on mioa and glass substrates, only the nichrome films show any tendency to grow epitaxially. The metal films sinter appreciably above temperatures of about one-third of the melting point in degrees absolute, at which surface diffusion is operative to promote grain-boundary penetration. Thus, the nichrome films with the lowest melting point sinter more readily than the nickel or chromium. Sintering is enhanced by increased temperature and becomes extensive above the Tammann temperature (about half the melting point in degrees absolute) when it is promoted also by crystal lattice diffusion. The metal films are oxidised when heated in oxygen, carbon dioxide, or air. Their sintering and <b>oxidation</b> <b>behaviours</b> are compared with that of the metals and their oxides in bulk and changes in phase composition, surface area, crystallite and aggregate mixes, are correlated with experimental conditions such as time and temperature. The electrical properties of the metal films depend strongly on their crystallinity. The nichrome (compared with the nickel and chromium) films conform more closely to the bulk metal properties and are more adherent to non-metallic substrates. Their resistance and resistivity are more uniform and less variable with temperature. This emphasises the need to deposit metal films, particularly nickel and chromium on initially heated substrates (to temperatures permitting surface or lattice diffusion) to avoid formation of isolated aggregates and obtain more perfect overall crystallinity...|$|R

40|$|Electrochemical {{oxidation}} of (C 6 H 5) 3 P=N(C 6 H 5) and (C 6 H 5) 3 P=N(C 6 H 5) {{leads to}} EPR spectra which reveal the dimeric {{structure of the}} resulting radical cation. In contrast to this <b>behaviour,</b> <b>oxidation</b> of bis-iminophosphorane leads to [(C 6 H 5) 3 P=N(C 6 H 4) N=P(C 6 H 5) 3]∑+: In these species the unpaired electron is delocalized on the N(C 6 H 4) N moiety and the persistency of the radical depends upon the relative position of the two P=N bonds...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{investigates the}} high {{temperature}} <b>oxidation</b> and corrosion <b>behaviour</b> of high entropy superalloys (HESA). A high content of various solutes in HESA leads to formation of complex oxides, however the Cr and Al activities of HESA are sufficient to promote protective chromia or alumina formation on the surface. By comparing the oxidation and corrosion resistances of a Ni-based superalloy—CM 247 LC, Al 2 O 3 -forming HESA can possess comparable oxidation resistance at 1100 °C, and Cr 2 O 3 -forming HESA can exhibit superior resistance against hot corrosion at 900 °C. This work has demonstrated {{the potential of}} HESA to maintain surface stability in oxidizing and corrosive environments...|$|R
