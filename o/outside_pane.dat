50|$|To {{keep the}} sun's heat {{out of the}} house, a low-emissivity coating should {{be applied to the}} <b>outside</b> <b>pane</b> of glazed windows. If the windows are {{designed}} to provide heat energy in the winter and keep heat inside the house (typical of cold climates), the low-emissivity coating should be applied to the inside pane of glazed windows. Such films also reduce the amount of visible and ultraviolet radiation entering a window, and are often applied to reduce fading of the contents of a room. Silvered film may also be employed to the same end. Spectrally selective films act by blocking certain wavelengths of the sun's infrared radiation and reject heat without reducing natural light.|$|E

25|$|Typically, spacers {{are filled}} with or contain {{desiccant}} to remove moisture trapped in the gas space during manufacturing, thereby lowering the dew point of the gas in that space, and preventing condensation from forming on surface #2 when the <b>outside</b> glass <b>pane</b> temperature falls.|$|R
5000|$|On April 13, 2010, a {{rock was}} thrown into {{the window of a}} door on the {{northeast}} side of the building. The rock broke the <b>outside</b> glass <b>pane,</b> but did not go {{all the way through the}} window. The incident was reported to campus police around 10:58 a.m. the next day. President George Dennison sent out a campus wide email that appealed to the campus to report [...] "any activities that appear to threaten the grounds, facilities, and campus members." ...|$|R

40|$|Photograph of Ramona {{looking out}} of a window at her Camulos Ranch, California, 1901. The {{rectangular}} window with thick bars in front and old, wooden shutters at its sides stands in the wall at center. Ramona sits inside the ranch with her hand at {{her face as she}} gazes into the foreground. Tall bushes stand just below the window <b>pane</b> <b>outside.</b> The ranch was a prominent location in Helen Hunt Jackson's novel, Ramona...|$|R
5000|$|The New York Times wrote, [...] "let a Hollywood {{producer}} {{launch a}} film series and very shortly the stories, as they appear, become as formalized as Chinese checkers. The Nick Carter mysteries are no exception...Through it all Nick is magnificently careless. Though sudden death lurks <b>outside</b> the window <b>pane,</b> he never pulls a shade. When seconds count, he saves one to pinch a cutie's cheek. When lesser men quail, he lights a cigarette. As usual, he wins his {{game in a}} welter of comic-strip heroics. But, as we were suggesting, it's a little like playing checkers with an opponent whose tricks became familiar long ago" [...] whereas Leonard Maltin called the film an [...] "above-average private-eye yarn." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Before {{you drop}} the curtain--I'm reminded: [...] You {{recollect}} {{the boy who}} came out here [...] To breathe the air one winter--had a room [...] Down at the Averys'? Well, one sunny morning [...] After a downy storm, he passed our place [...] And found me banking up the house with snow. [...] And I was burrowing in deep for warmth, [...] Piling it well above the window-sills. [...] The snow against the window caught his eye. [...] 'Hey, that's a pretty thought'--those were his words. [...] 'So you can think it's six feet deep outside, [...] While you sit warm and read up balanced rations. [...] You can't get too much winter in the winter.' [...] Those were his words. And he went home and all [...] But banked the daylight out of Avery's windows. [...] Now you and I would go to no such length. [...] At {{the same time you}} can't deny it makes [...] It not a mite worse, sitting here, we three, [...] Playing our fancy, to have the snowline run [...] So high across the <b>pane</b> <b>outside.</b> There where [...] There is a sort of tunnel in the frost [...] More like a tunnel than a hole--way down [...] At the far end of it you see a stir [...] And quiver like the frayed edge of the drift [...] Blown in the wind. I like that--I like that. [...] Well, now I leave you, people." ...|$|R
60|$|Thus {{they sat}} {{depressed}} to silence at the dining-room table, oblivious of everything, while Rodney paced the drawing-room overhead in such agitation and exaltation of mind {{as he had}} never conceived possible, and Cassandra remained alone with her uncle. Ralph, at length, rose and walked gloomily to the window. He pressed close to the <b>pane.</b> <b>Outside</b> were truth and freedom and the immensity only to be apprehended by the mind in loneliness, and never communicated to another. What worse sacrilege was there than to attempt to violate what he perceived by seeking to impart it? Some movement behind him made him reflect that Katharine had the power, if she chose, to be in person what he dreamed of her spirit. He turned sharply to implore her help, when again he was struck cold by her look of distance, her expression of intentness upon some far object. As if conscious of his look upon her she rose and came to him, standing close by his side, and looking with him out into the dusky atmosphere. Their physical closeness was to him a bitter enough comment upon the distance between their minds. Yet distant as she was, her presence by his side transformed the world. He saw himself performing wonderful deeds of courage; saving the drowning, rescuing the forlorn. Impatient with this form of egotism, he could not shake off the conviction that somehow life was wonderful, romantic, a master worth serving so long as she stood there. He had no wish that she should speak; {{he did not look}} at her or touch her; she was apparently deep in her own thoughts and oblivious of his presence.|$|R
