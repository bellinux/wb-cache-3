40|$|In many a {{developing}} world context like Uganda’s, evidence- literacy among legislators had been poor for many years. This had left both legislative debates and decision-making processes in Parliament {{to be driven}} more by personal opinion and political sentiments, rather than <b>objective</b> <b>facts</b> and empirical <b>evidence.</b> The introduction, however, of a pioneering and innovate Legislative Research and Library Services, {{one of the very}} first of such services on the African continent, has revolutionized legislative debates and decision- making. This paper, taking the case of Uganda, underscores the role of Parliamentary library and research resources in building well-informed legislatures. The evolution of library and research resources in Uganda’s Parliament as well as the innovations and outputs are discussed. Through innovative library and research resources, well informed Parliaments can be created...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{approaches}} the current epistemological debate on peer disagreement from a neo-Pyrrhonian perspective, thus adopting {{a form of}} skepticism which is more radical than those discussed in the literature. It makes use of argumentative strategies found in ancient Pyrrhonism both to show that such a debate rests on problematic assumptions and to block some maneuvers intended to offer an efficacious way of settling {{a considerable number of}} peer disputes. The essay takes issue with three views held in the peer disagreement debate: there is an <b>objective</b> <b>fact</b> of the matter about at least most controversial questions; we possess theory-neutral evidence bearing on those questions which grants us access to the truth of the matter; and many peer controversies are resolved by attending to which disputant has correctly evaluated the objective evidence. With respect to the first two views, it is argued that the belief in both <b>objective</b> <b>facts</b> and theory-neutral <b>evidence</b> is subject to fierce dispute, and should not therefore be taken for granted in the discussion of peer disagreement. As for the third view, it is argued that from either a first- or a third-person perspective, there seems to be epistemic symmetry between the disputants which makes it necessary to suspend judgment...|$|R

50|$|More {{fundamental}} {{than these}} three is invariance: An <b>objective</b> <b>fact</b> is invariant under various transformations. For instance, space-time {{is a significant}} <b>objective</b> <b>fact</b> because an interval involving both temporal and spatial separation is invariant, whereas no simpler interval involving only temporal or only spatial separation is invariant under Lorentz transformations.|$|R

40|$|Generally, {{evidence}} of bad {{character of a}} person especially accused in a case cannot be tendered as it is inadmissible. However, there are few situations where the {{evidence of}} bad character may be adduced as relevant in a case if it is provided under the ambit of Evidence Law. Among others, similar <b>fact</b> <b>evidence</b> may be given in a case although it will amount to a bad character of the accused. This article addresses the issue of relevancy of similar <b>fact</b> <b>evidence</b> in Malaysia by referring to the provisions under the Evidence Act 1950 and the decided cases. This article further explains the factors to be considered by the courts before admitting similar <b>fact</b> <b>evidence</b> against the accused in Malaysia. The article found that “striking similarity ” which {{has been used as}} a main component in admitting similar <b>fact</b> <b>evidence</b> in Malaysia has been relaxed by the Malaysian apex court in the case of Public Prosecutor v Mohamad Roslan bin Desa. The article also found that though the Evidence Act 1950 does not contain any direct provisions relating to similar <b>fact</b> <b>evidence,</b> sections 14 and 15 have been used as similar fact provisions in Malaysia...|$|R
40|$|Participants decided whom of two {{patients}} to prioritize for surgery in three studies. The factual quantitative {{information about the}} patients (e. g., probability of surviving surgery) was given in vignette form with case descriptions on Visual Analogue Scales — VAS’s. Differentiation and Consolidation theory predicts that not only the attractiveness of facts but also the mental representations of <b>objective</b> <b>facts</b> themselves will be restructured in post-decision processes {{in support of a}} decision (Svenson, 2003). After the decision, participants were asked to reproduce the <b>objective</b> <b>facts</b> about the patients. The results showed that distortions of <b>objective</b> <b>facts</b> were used to consolidate a prior decision. The consolidation process relied on facts initially favoring the non-chosen alternative and on facts rated as less, rather than more important...|$|R
50|$|Note {{that similar}} <b>fact</b> <b>evidence</b> is only {{permissible}} to resolve facts in issue. What is in issue {{will depend on}} the nature of the defence. For example, where the defence is an alibi, the presence or absence of the accused at the particular place is crucial, and similar <b>fact</b> <b>evidence</b> could conceivably be relevant. If the defence is self-defence, however, different considerations apply.|$|R
5000|$|Moral anti-realism, on {{the other}} hand, holds that moral {{statements}} either fail or do not even attempt to report <b>objective</b> moral <b>facts.</b> Instead, they hold that moral sentences are either categorically false claims of <b>objective</b> moral <b>facts</b> (error theory); claims about subjective attitudes rather than <b>objective</b> <b>facts</b> (ethical subjectivism); or else not attempts to describe the world at all but rather something else, like an expression of an emotion or the issuance of a command (non-cognitivism).|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide an example of how applied phronesis can be used as a methodological {{approach}} in social research. The example consists of an exploration of the discourse of productivism in elderly care policy in Australia. Design/methodology/approach – The research interrogates arrangements of <b>objective</b> <b>facts</b> within recent representations of the aged which render particular policy discourses rational. An analysis of selected secondary data and texts is offered to demonstrate how applied phronesis may be used to discern when <b>objective</b> <b>facts</b> are presented in particular ways to sustain useful discourses, such as productivism. Findings – The paper demonstrates that, rather than being rational discourse, productivism employs suitable arrangements of <b>objective</b> <b>facts</b> leading to particular rationalisations, including that the elderly should be viewed as a separate “category”, that they are a burden on society and that they contribute to increasing health care costs. Alternative interpretations and arrangements of the same <b>objective</b> <b>facts</b> indicate that what is rendered as rational within the discourse of productivism may also be seen as a construct of power rather than an unavoidable and logical outcome. Research limitations/implications – Because it is intended mainly as a demonstration, this paper offers a limited application of applied phronesis. Originality/value – The research is employed as a practical demonstration of the efficacy of applied phronesis in social research. At the same time, this is the first phronetic exploration of productivism in aged care policy...|$|R

60|$|For distinction’s sake, every fact {{which is}} solely {{composed}} of feelings or {{states of consciousness}} considered as such, is often called a Psychological or Subjective fact; while every fact which is composed, either wholly or in part, of something different from these, that is, of substances and attributes, is called an <b>Objective</b> <b>fact.</b> We may say, then, that every <b>objective</b> <b>fact</b> is grounded on a corresponding subjective one; and has no meaning to us (apart from the subjective fact which corresponds to it), except as {{a name for the}} unknown and inscrutable process by which that subjective or psychological fact is brought to pass.|$|R

2500|$|One of Kierkegaard's {{recurrent}} themes is {{the importance}} of subjectivity, which {{has to do with the}} way people relate themselves to (objective) truths. In Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments, he argues that [...] "subjectivity is truth" [...] and [...] "truth is subjectivity." [...] What he means by this is that most essentially, truth is not just a matter of discovering <b>objective</b> <b>facts.</b> While <b>objective</b> <b>facts</b> are important, there is a second and more crucial element of truth, which involves how one relates oneself to those matters of fact. Since how one acts is, from the ethical perspective, more important than any matter of fact, truth is to be found in subjectivity rather than objectivity.|$|R

5000|$|The relativist fallacy, {{also known}} as the subjectivist fallacy, is {{claiming}} that something is true for one person but not true for someone else. The fallacy is supposed to rest on the law of noncontradiction. The fallacy applies only to <b>objective</b> <b>facts,</b> or what are alleged to be <b>objective</b> <b>facts,</b> rather than to facts about personal tastes or subjective experiences, and only to facts regarded in the same sense and at the same time. On this formulation, the very name [...] "relativist fallacy" [...] begs the question against anyone who earnestly (however mistakenly or not) holds that there are no [...] "objective facts." [...] So some more work must be done, in a non-question-begging way, to make it clear wherein, exactly, the fallacy lies.|$|R
