5|$|In {{the mid-1970s}} McClory again {{started working on}} a project to bring a Thunderball {{adaptation}} to production and, with the working title Warhead (a.k.a. James Bond <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secret</b> Service) he brought writer Len Deighton together with Sean Connery {{to work on a}} script. The script ran into difficulties after accusations from Eon Productions that the project had gone beyond copyright restrictions, which confined McClory to a film based on the Thunderball novel only, and once again the project was deferred. Towards the end of the 1970s developments were reported on the project under the name James Bond <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secret</b> Service, but then producer Jack Schwartzman became involved and cleared a number of the legal issues that still surrounded the project and licensed the rights from McClory.|$|E

40|$|In an {{unconditionally secure}} Distributed Oblivious Transfer (DOT) protocol, a {{receiver}} contacts at least k servers to obtain one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> n <b>secrets</b> {{held by a}} sender. Once the protocol has been executed, the sender does not know which secret was chosen by the receiver and the receiver has not gained information on <b>the</b> <b>secrets</b> she did not choose. In practical applications, <b>the</b> probability distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>secrets</b> may not be uniform, e. g., when DOT protocols are used in auctions, some bids may be more probable than others. In this kind of scenario, we show that the claim "a party cannot obtain more than a linear combination of secrets" is incorrect; depending on <b>the</b> probability distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>secrets,</b> some existing polynomial interpolation-based DOT protocols allow a cheating receiver, or a curious server, who has obtained a linear combination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>secrets</b> to determine all <b>the</b> <b>secrets...</b>|$|R
5|$|As Steinhauer {{noted in}} his autobiography, the UK was a {{dangerous}} environment for a foreign agent. Only five years previously, the country {{had not had a}} dedicated counter-espionage organisation. In 1909 a series of spy scares fanned by the press led to the establishment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secret</b> Service Bureau, jointly headed by Captain Vernon Kell and Lieutenant-Commander Mansfield Cumming. They soon split their responsibilities; Kell took charge of counter-espionage, while Cumming focused on foreign intelligence. These two divisions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secret</b> Service Bureau eventually became two independent intelligence agencies, MI5 and MI6. The Bureau quickly identified a list of possible German agents in the UK. Just before the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, Chief Constables across Britain and Ireland were instructed to arrest suspects in their areas. This was done quickly and a number of German agents were caught, crippling German intelligence operations in the UK at a crucial moment in the war. Steinhauer himself had been lucky to escape arrest; he was known by name to the British authorities and he had been spying on the Royal Navy in Scotland as recently as late June 1914.|$|E

5|$|However, it {{is unclear}} whether Lucas {{intended}} Palpatine to be the reigning Emperor or just the first of a succession of Emperors. Michael Kaminski, author <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Secret</b> History of Star Wars, claims that Lucas' initial notes discuss a line of corrupt Emperors, not just one. If Palpatine was the first, Kaminski infers, he would therefore not be the current. Later Lucas would abandon this idea, opting instead to focus on a sole villainous ruler.|$|E

Meanwhile, Major General Henning von Tresckow attempts to assassinate Adolf Hitler by smuggling a bomb aboard the Führers personal airplane. The bomb, however, is a dud and fails to detonate, and Tresckow flies to Berlin in order to safely retrieve it. After learning that the Gestapo has arrested Major General Hans Oster, he orders General Olbricht to find a replacement. After recruiting Stauffenberg into the German Resistance, Olbricht presents Stauffenberg at a meeting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>secret</b> committee which has coordinated previous attempts on Hitler's life.

The total budget for the game was about $600,000, according to Schafer.|$|E
