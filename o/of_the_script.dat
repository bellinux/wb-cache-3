5|$|Jokes {{from earlier}} scripts were used. In one scene, Carla Tortelli orders a phone caller to do {{something}} about their unruly children. When one of the bartenders suggests hiring a babysitter, Carla replied that the caller was the babysitter.

5|$|Rewrites <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>script</b> {{gradually}} {{moved away}} from the ensemble of comedians and began to focus on two central characters, at which point Murphy left the project.

5|$|According to Bobby Darin's agent, Martin Baum, Paul Newman's agent {{turned down}} the part of Fast Eddie. Newman was {{originally}} unavailable to play Fast Eddie regardless, being committed to star opposite Elizabeth Taylor in the film Two for the Seesaw. Rossen offered Darin the part after seeing him on The Mike Wallace Interview. When Taylor was forced {{to drop out of}} Seesaw because of shooting overruns on Cleopatra, Newman was freed up to take the role, which he accepted after reading just half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>script.</b> No one associated with the production officially notified Darin or his representatives that he had been replaced; they found out from a member of the public at a charity horse race.|$|E
5|$|According to {{contemporary}} rumors, Verne and d'Ennery came to difficulties over {{the treatment of}} science in the play, with d'Ennery wanting to condemn scientific research and Verne advocating a more science-friendly and hopeful approach. Verne reportedly cut some especially negative lines out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>script,</b> and protested when d'Ennery had them reinserted for the production. Journey Through the Impossible would be their last collaboration. The play is also Verne's only contribution to the féerie genre.|$|E
