5|$|As he {{had done}} for other Adventures of Tintin which {{featured}} sea travel, Hergé was careful to obtain as much data about ships as possible {{in order to make}} his portrayals more realistic. The design of the Aurora was based on the RRS William Scoresby, while that of the Peary was most likely based upon another Antarctic ship, the RRS Discovery. The seaplane <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> expedition travels was based on the German Arado 196-A. Hergé nevertheless later criticised his own efforts in this area, saying that if Aurora had been a real ship, it would probably be unseaworthy.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{followed}} a specific structure {{for most of}} the cantatas of his chorale cantata cycle, especially the 40 he presented consecutively from the first Sunday after Trinity of 1724 to Palm Sunday of 1725. In this chorale cantata format he retained the original text and melody of the chorale <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> cantata was based in the outer stanzas, typically treating the first as a chorale fantasia and the last as a four-part chorale setting, while the inner stanzas were reworded by a librettist as the basis for recitatives and arias, usually with music independent of the chorale tune.|$|E

5|$|Because Missouri had {{run aground}} during {{an unusually high}} tide, Wallin {{required}} a date <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> tide would be roughly comparable to {{the conditions under which}} Missouri was grounded in order to free her. The date selected was 2 February. With time as a factor, Wallin took charge of the operation and put his five-point plan into motion. With the assistance of Admiral Smith, Wallin was able to assemble a large salvage force which included submarine rescue ships, special salvage ships, divers, and pontoons to add additional buoyancy for the tug boats when the time came to move Missouri.|$|E
5|$|Between 1915 and 1919, work {{proceeded}} at Apollo Bundar (Port) {{to reclaim}} the land <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> gateway and the new sea wall would be built.

5|$|Due to {{the steep}} slope <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> {{building}} is situated, {{it had to}} be specially designed out of concrete to fit into its foundations correctly. From the front, the building appears to have only three floors. However, from the rear, all of its six floors can be seen. One part of the building's foundation was made of concrete piles, and the other as a continuous foundation. Usually, these two approaches do not mix well but Horodecki somehow succeeded in overcoming this technical problem.|$|E
