25|$|The {{frequency}} of the local oscillator fLO is set so the desired reception radio frequency fRF mixes to fIF. There are two choices for the local <b>oscillator</b> <b>frequency</b> because the dominant mixer products are at fRF±fLO. If the local <b>oscillator</b> <b>frequency</b> {{is less than the}} desired reception frequency, it is called low-side injection (fIF = fRF − fLO); if the local oscillator is higher, then it is called high-side injection (fIF = fLO − fRF).|$|E

40|$|JACK-ON is a {{wireless}} sensor interface using sine tone oscillators. Sensor resistances alter <b>oscillator</b> <b>frequencies</b> or amplitudes, and the audio output of oscillators is sent through a generic wireless audio transceiver. The wireless audio receiver is {{plugged into the}} computer’s sound card, where <b>oscillator</b> <b>frequencies</b> and amplitudes are analyzed in software.

2500|$|In this example, {{an array}} tracksig {{is assumed to}} contain a {{reference}} signal to be tracked. [...] The oscillator is implemented by a counter, with the most significant bit of the counter indicating the on/off status of the oscillator. [...] This code simulates the two D-type flip-flops that comprise a phase-frequency comparator. [...] When either the reference or signal has a positive edge, the corresponding flip-flop switches high. [...] Once both reference and signal is high, both flip-flops are reset. [...] Which flip-flop is high determines at that instant whether the reference or signal leads the other. [...] The error signal {{is the difference between}} these two flip-flop values. [...] The pole-zero filter is implemented by adding the error signal and its derivative to the filtered error signal. [...] This in turn is integrated to find the <b>oscillator</b> <b>frequency.</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} process by which quantum {{correlations}} are created when an interaction Hamiltonian is repeatedly applied to a system of two harmonic oscillators for some characteristic time interval. We show that, for the case where the <b>oscillator</b> <b>frequencies</b> are equal, the initial Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions of the uncoupled parts evolve to a new equilibrium Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution through a series of transient Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions. Further, we discuss why the equilibrium reached when the two <b>oscillator</b> <b>frequencies</b> are unequal, is not a thermal one. All the calculations are exact and the results are obtained through an iterative process, without using perturbation theory. Comment: 22 pages, 6 Figures, Added contents, to appear in PR...|$|R
2500|$|A {{drawback}} of resonant coupling {{theory is}} that at close ranges when the two resonant circuits are tightly coupled, the resonant frequency {{of the system is}} no longer constant but [...] "splits" [...] into two resonant peaks, so the maximum power transfer no longer occurs at the original resonant frequency and the <b>oscillator</b> <b>frequency</b> must be tuned to the new resonance peak. The case of using such a shifted peak is called [...] "Single resonant". The [...] "Single resonant" [...] systems have also been used, in which only the secondary is a tuned circuit. The principle of this phenomenon is also called [...] "(Magnetic) phase synchronization" [...] and already started practical application for AGV in Japan from around 1993. And now, the concept of Highly Resonant presented by MIT is applied only to the secondary side resonator, and high efficiency wide gap high power wireless power transfer system is realized and it is used for induction current collector of SCMaglev.|$|E
2500|$|To {{suppress}} the unwanted image, the tuning of the RF {{stage and the}} LO may need to [...] "track" [...] each other. In some cases, a narrow-band receiver can have a fixed tuned RF amplifier. In that case, only the local <b>oscillator</b> <b>frequency</b> is changed. In most cases, a receiver's input band is wider than its IF center frequency. For example, a typical AM broadcast band receiver covers 510kHz to 1655kHz (a roughly 1160kHz input band) with a 455kHz IF frequency; an FM broadcast band receiver covers 88MHz to 108MHz band with a 10.7MHz IF frequency. In that situation, the RF amplifier must be tuned so the IF amplifier does not see two stations at the same time. If the AM broadcast band receiver LO were set at 1200kHz, it would see stations at both 745kHz (1200455kHz) and 1655kHz. Consequently, the RF stage must be designed so that any stations that are twice the IF frequency away are significantly attenuated. The tracking {{can be done with}} a multi-section variable capacitor or some varactors driven by a common control voltage. An RF amplifier may have tuned circuits at both its input and its output, so three or more tuned circuits may be tracked. In practice, the RF and LO frequencies need to track closely but not perfectly.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} system {{involving}} mutual interaction between three qubits and an oscillator within the ultrastrong coupling regime. We apply adiabatic approximation approach to explore two extreme regimes: (i) the <b>oscillator's</b> <b>frequency</b> is far larger than each qubit's frequency and (ii) the qubit's frequency is far {{larger than the}} <b>oscillator's</b> <b>frequency,</b> and analyze the energy-level spectrum and the ground-state property of the qubit-oscillator system under the conditions of various system parameters. For the energy-level spectrum, we concentrate on studying the degeneracy in low energy levels. For the ground state, we focus on its nonclassical properties that are necessary for preparing the nonclassical states. We show that the minimum qubit-oscillator coupling strength needed for generating the nonclassical states of the Schrödinger-cat type in the oscillator is just one half {{of that in the}} Rabi model. We find that the qubit-qubit entanglement in the ground state vanishes if the qubit-oscillator coupling strength is strong enough, for which the entropy of three qubits keeps larger than one. We also observe the phase-transition-like behavior in the regime where the qubit's frequency is far larger than the <b>oscillator's</b> <b>frequency.</b> Comment: 12 pages, 9 figures, accepted by Phys.
