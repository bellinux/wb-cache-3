25|$|Above the supercharger's {{critical}} altitude of about 12,000ft (3,658m), an early P-39's performance dropped off rapidly. This limited its usefulness in traditional fighter missions in Europe {{as well as}} in the Pacific, where it was not uncommon for Japanese bombers to attack at altitudes above the P-39's <b>operational</b> <b>ceiling</b> (which in the tropical hot air was lower than in moderate climates).

25|$|The {{squadron}} {{would become}} fully operational with its first six RB-57Ds only 120 {{days from the}} delivery of its first RB-57D. Those first six aircraft, all Group A RB-57Ds, deployed Yokota AB, Japan and to Eielson AFB, Alaska in late 1956 for reconnaissance missions over what is presumed to be China, North Korea and the Soviet Union. The detachment at Yokota was used to monitor fall-out from Soviet tests in Operation Sea Lion. Other sorties were flown over Communist China, the RB-57D's <b>operational</b> <b>ceiling</b> being well above that of Chinese MiG-15s. The Eielson-based aircraft conducted ELINT around the Kamchatka Peninsula of the Soviet Union. On 15 Dec 1956 three aircraft overflew Vladivostok.|$|E
25|$|The P-40 {{initially}} proved quite {{effective against}} Axis aircraft {{and contributed to}} a slight shift of momentum in the Allies' favor. The gradual replacement of Hurricanes by the Tomahawks and Kittyhawks led to the Luftwaffe accelerating retirement of the Bf 109E and introducing the newer Bf 109F; these were to be flown by the veteran pilots of elite Luftwaffe units, such as Jagdgeschwader 27 (JG27), in North Africa. The P-40 was generally considered roughly equal or slightly superior to the Bf 109 at low altitude but inferior at high altitude, particularly against the Bf 109F. Most air combat in North Africa took place well below , negating much of the Bf 109's superiority. The P-40 usually had an advantage over the Bf 109 in horizontal maneuvers (turning), dive speed and structural strength, was roughly equal in firepower but was slightly inferior in speed and outclassed in rate of climb and <b>operational</b> <b>ceiling.</b>|$|E
50|$|Upon {{arriving}} at Rapp Motorenwerke, Friz was tasked {{to develop an}} aircraft engine that could attain very high altitudes as well as be durable and aerodynamically favorable. A higher <b>operational</b> flight <b>ceiling</b> was a critical strategic advantage for the pilot (since the atmospheric pressure decreases the higher a pilot flies a plane, a conventional engine at this time literally stalled out above 3,000 meters).|$|R
2500|$|The {{campus was}} Wi-Fi enabled. Surveillance {{was carried out}} through CCTV cameras in the {{laboratories}} and classrooms. Initially, a centralised air-conditioning system for the whole building was planned. Even AC ducts were installed in the ceilings. But the system never became completely <b>operational.</b> Ultimately, <b>ceiling</b> fans had to be installed in all the rooms. Air-conditioning units were installed wherever they were needed (e.g. computer labs, seminar halls, etc.) ...|$|R
50|$|The S.36 was {{initially}} accepted for testing under Specification B.8/41, {{which had been}} specifically written to cover the type, and an order {{for a pair of}} prototypes was placed. However, Arthur Harris, as commander of Bomber Command, felt that achieving bulk production of the type would take too much time and that the effort would be better expended on outfitted the existing design with improved Hercules engines with the aim of providing a higher <b>operational</b> altitude <b>ceiling.</b> However, despite the Air Staff having initially found the proposal to have some attraction, it was eventually decided to favour increased production rates of the rival Avro Lancaster instead. In May 1942, Shorts were informed that the Air Ministry would not be continuing the project; in August 1942, Shorts decided to terminate all work.|$|R
25|$|The F-82E had a {{range of}} over , which meant that with {{external}} fuel tanks it could fly from London to Moscow, loiter for 30 minutes over the target, and return, the only American fighter which could do so. It also had an <b>operational</b> <b>ceiling</b> of , where it could {{stay close to the}} bombers it was designed to protect. The first production F-82Es reached the 27th in early 1948, and almost immediately the group was deployed to McChord AFB, Washington, in June, where its squadrons stood on alert on a secondary air defense mission due to heightened tensions over the Berlin Airlift. It was also believed that the 27th would launch an escort mission, presumably to the Soviet Union, if conflict broke out in Europe. From McChord, the group flew its Twin Mustangs on weather reconnaissance missions over the northwest Pacific, but problems were encountered with their fuel tanks. Decommissioned F-61 Black Widow external tanks were found at Hamilton AFB, California, which could be modified for the F-82; fitted on the pylons of the Twin Mustang, these solved the problem. With a reduction in tension, the 27th returned to its home base in Nebraska during September, where the unit settled down to transition flying with their aircraft.|$|E
500|$|The {{resulting}} design {{went through}} considerable evolution, owing to both its cutting-edge technology and continual redefinition of the USAF requirements. Early revisions prominently featured canards, with {{a span of}} 19ft 10in (6.04 m), and a wing of 53.5° sweep. The aircraft in this configuration {{would have had a}} maximum takeoff weight of 99,400lb (45,088kg) with a 72,550 feet (22,113 m) <b>operational</b> <b>ceiling.</b> In addition to the F-108's interceptor role, North American proposed it as an escort fighter for its own B-70 Valkyrie supersonic bomber prototype. Commonality between the B-70 bomber and the F-108 included the escape capsule and General Electric YJ93 engines. Another role considered was for the F-108 to be [...] "gap-fillers" [...] for the Distant Early Warning (DEW) system; because of its great speed, the F-108 could have scanned up to [...] per hour.|$|E

Some of these ITWS products will allow air traffic managers to anticipate significant short-term changes in ceiling and visibility. This report focuses on the scientific data requirements for supporting prototype model-system development and diagnostics. Model diagnostics can include case studies to determine the most important physical processes that were responsible for a particular ceiling and visibility-event, " providing the insight necessary for the development of effective ceiling and visibility product algorithms. In time such case study diagnostics could also include careful off-line "failure analyses " that may affect the design of the <b>operational</b> system.

The margin between that maximum speed and the stall speed at that altitude was only [...] This narrow window is called the [...] "coffin corner", [...] because breaching either limit would likely cause airflow separation at the wings or tail. For {{most of the time}} on a typical mission the U-2 was flying less than five knots above stall speed. A stall would cause a loss of altitude, possibly leading to detection and overstress of the airframe.|$|E
2500|$|Improved {{aircraft}} {{designs were}} in the offing with the Bristol Beaufighter, then under development. It would prove formidable but its development was slow. The Beaufighter had a maximum speed of , an <b>operational</b> <b>ceiling</b> of , a climb rate of [...] per minute and its battery of four [...] Hispano cannon and six [...]303in Browning machine guns was much more lethal. On 19 November, John Cunningham of No. 604 Squadron RAF shot down a bomber flying an AI-equipped Beaufighter, the first air victory for the airborne radar. In November and December 1940, the Luftwaffe flew 9,000 sorties against British targets and RAF night fighters claimed only six shot down. In January 1941, Fighter Command flew 486 sorties against 1,965 made by the Germans. Just three and 12 were claimed by the RAF and AA defences respectively. In the bad weather of February 1941, Fighter Command flew 568 sorties to counter the Luftwaffe which flew 1,644 sorties. Night fighters could claim only four bombers for four losses.|$|E

The Allied {{reporting}} name was [...] "Frank"; the Japanese Army designation was [...] The Ki-84 is generally considered the best Japanese fighter to see large-scale operation during the conflict. The aircraft boasted high speeds and excellent maneuverability with an armament (up to two 30mm and two 20mm cannon) that gave it formidable firepower. The Ki-84's performance matched that of any single-engine Allied fighter it faced, while its <b>operational</b> <b>ceiling</b> enabled it to intercept high-flying B-29 Superfortress bombers. Pilots and crews in the field learned to take care with the plane's high-maintenance Nakajima Homare engine and landing gear prone to buckling. The difficulties of Japan's situation late in the war took a toll on the aircraft's overall field performance as manufacturing defects multiplied, quality fuel proved difficult to procure, and experienced pilots grew scarce. Even then, the pilot of a well-maintained Ki-84 took to the skies in knowing possession of Japan's fastest fighter. A total of 3,514 aircraft were built.|$|E
2500|$|On 10 April 1959, on the {{occasion}} of the Islamic Eid ul-Fitr festival holiday in Pakistan, an Indian Air Force (IAF) English Electric Canberra B(I)58 of No. 106 Squadron entered Pakistani airspace on a photo reconnaissance mission. [...] Two PAF F-86F Sabres (Flt. Lt. M. N. Butt (leader) and Flt. Lt. M. Yunis) of No. 15 Squadron on Air Defence Alert (ADA) were scrambled from Sargodha Air Base to intercept the IAF aircraft. Butt attempted to bring down the Canberra by firing his Sabre's machine guns, but the Canberra was flying at an altitude of more than 50,000 feet— beyond the <b>operational</b> <b>ceiling</b> of the F-86F. When Yunis took over from his leader, the Canberra suddenly lost height while executing a turn over Rawalpindi.

2500|$|The fighter {{needed to}} have {{a top speed of}} 400km/h (250mph) at 6,000m (19,690ft), to be {{maintained}} for 20 minutes, while having a total flight duration of 90 minutes. The critical altitude of 6,000 metres was to be reached in no more than 17 minutes, and the fighter was to have an <b>operational</b> <b>ceiling</b> of 10,000 metres. Power was to be provided by the new Junkers Jumo 210 engine of about 522kW (700hp). It was to be armed with either a single 20mm MG C/30 engine-mounted cannon firing through the propeller hub as a Motorkanone, or two engine cowl-mounted 7.92mm (.312in) MG 17 machine guns, or one lightweight engine-mounted 20mm MG FF cannon with two 7.92mm MG 17s. The MG C/30 was an airborne adaption of the 2 cm FlaK 30 anti-aircraft gun, which fired very powerful [...] "Long Solothurn" [...] ammunition, but was very heavy and had a low rate of fire. It was also specified that the wing loading should be kept below 100kg/m2. The performance was to be evaluated based on [...] the fighter's level speed, rate of climb, and manoeuvrability, in that order.|$|E
2500|$|On 30 June 1945, {{the third}} of 75 Lockheed P-38M-5-LO Lightning night fighter {{conversions}} arrived at Eglin Field from the Lockheed Dallas Modification Center for Operational Suitability Testing. For {{the next two months}} the P-38M-5 was flown against a standard P-38L-5-LO and a somewhat [...] "test-weary" [...] P-61B Black Widow. It was found to be operationally suitable as a night fighter as far as airplane performance and characteristics were concerned. Compared to the P-38L-5, the M's handling qualities and flying characteristics had not been materially affected, though its top speed was about 15 miles per hour lower. The Eglin tests found the P-38M superior to the P-61B in speed at altitudes, rate of climb, <b>operational</b> <b>ceiling,</b> and ease of flying at high speeds. The fixed armament of the Lightning limited its effective attack approach to a level stern approach. [...] "In all-around effectiveness the P-38M would probably be superior to the P-61B because its performance would enable it to intercept enemy airplanes which the P-61B is incapable of intercepting. Against enemy types which both airplanes are capable of intercepting, the P-61B would probably prove more effective because of its superior equipment and armament arrangement." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first {{aircraft}} {{to put this}} theory to the test was the RB-36D specialized photographic-reconnaissance version of the B-36D.
