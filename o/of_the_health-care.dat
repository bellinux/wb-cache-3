40|$|Background: Health-care {{financing}} {{should be}} equitable. In {{many developing countries}} such as Kenya, changes to health-care financing systems are being implemented {{as a means of}} providing equitable access to health care with <b>the</b> aim <b>of</b> attaining universal coverage. Vertical equity means that people of dissimilar ability to pay make dissimilar levels <b>of</b> contribution to <b>the</b> <b>health-care</b> financing system. Vertical equity can be analysed by measuring progressivity. Objectives: <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this study was to analyse progressivity by measuring deviations from proportionality in the relationship between sources of health-care financing and ability to pay using Kakwani indices applied to data from the Kenya Household Health Utilisation and Expenditure Survey 2007. Methods: Concentration indices and Kakwani indices were obtained for <b>the</b> sources <b>of</b> <b>health-care</b> financing: direct and indirect taxes, out of pocket (OOP) payments, private insurance contributions and contributions to the National Hospital Insurance Fund. The bootstrap method was used to analyse <b>the</b> sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kakwani index to changes in the equivalence scale or <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> an alternative measure of ability to pay. Results: <b>The</b> overall <b>health-care</b> financing system was regressive. Out of pocket payments were regressive with all other payments being proportional. Direct taxes, indirect taxes and private insurance premiums were sensitive to <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> income as an alternative measure of ability to pay. However, <b>the</b> overall finding <b>of</b> a regressive health-care system remained. Conclusion: Reforms to <b>the</b> Kenyan <b>health-care</b> financing system are required to reduce dependence on out <b>of</b> pocket payments. <b>The</b> bootstrap method can be used in determining <b>the</b> sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kakwani index to various assumptions made in the analysis. Further analyses are required to determine <b>the</b> equity <b>of</b> <b>health-care</b> utilization and <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> proposed reforms on overall equity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kenyan <b>health-care</b> system...|$|R
