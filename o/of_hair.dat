5|$|The {{earliest}} {{clear evidence}} <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> or fur is in fossils of Castorocauda and Megaconus, from 164 {{million years ago}} in the mid-Jurassic. In the 1950s, it was suggested that the foramina (passages) in the maxillae and premaxillae (bones {{in the front of the}} upper jaw) of cynodonts were channels which supplied blood vessels and nerves to vibrissae (whiskers) and so were evidence <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> or fur; it was soon pointed out, however, that foramina do not necessarily show that an animal had vibrissae, as the modern lizard Tupinambis has foramina that are almost identical to those found in the nonmammalian cynodont Thrinaxodon. Popular sources, nevertheless, continue to attribute whiskers to Thrinaxodon. Studies on Permian coprolites suggest that non-mammalian synapsids of the epoch already had fur, setting the evolution of hairs possibly as far back as dicynodonts.|$|E
5|$|The glands deposit sebum on the hairs, {{and bring}} it to the skin surface along the hair shaft. The {{structure}} consisting <b>of</b> <b>hair,</b> hair follicle, arrector pili muscles, and sebaceous gland is an epidermal invagination known as a pilosebaceous unit.|$|E
50|$|These {{losses were}} {{correlated}} with a shift from humid to dry habitats, indicating an adaptive function <b>of</b> <b>hairs</b> in moist environments. It had been previously hypothesised that these costly protein structures {{of the outer shell}} layer facilitate locomotion in moist habitats. Experiments by Pfenninger et al. (2005) showed an increased adherence of haired shells to wet surfaces. The possession <b>of</b> <b>hairs</b> facilitates the adherence of the snails to their herbaceous food plants during foraging, when humidity levels are high. The absence <b>of</b> <b>hairs</b> in some Trochulus species could thus be explained as a loss of the potential adaptive function linked to habitat shifts.|$|R

For example, he added, I one day said to her that I could [...] wager and demonstrate that there were in Paris at least two [...] inhabitants who had the same number <b>of</b> <b>hairs,</b> although I could not [...] point out who these two men were. She told me I could never be sure [...] of it until I had counted the <b>hairs</b> <b>of</b> these two men. Here is my [...] demonstration, I said: I take it for granted that the head which is [...] most amply supplied with hairs has not more than 200,000, and the [...] head which is least so has but one hair. Now, if you suppose that [...] 200,000 heads have each a different number <b>of</b> <b>hairs,</b> it necessarily [...] follows that they have each one of the numbers <b>of</b> <b>hairs</b> which form [...] the series from one to 200,000; for if it were supposed that there [...] were two among these 200,000 who had the same number <b>of</b> <b>hairs,</b> I [...] should have gained my wager. Supposing, then, that these 200,000 [...] inhabitants have all a different number <b>of</b> <b>hairs,</b> if I add a single [...] inhabitant who has hairs, and who has not more than 200,000, it [...] necessarily follows that this number <b>of</b> <b>hairs,</b> whatever it may be, [...] will be contained in the series from one to 200,000, and consequently [...] will be equal to the number <b>of</b> <b>hairs</b> on one <b>of</b> the previous 200,000 [...] inhabitants. Now as, instead of one inhabitant more than 200,000, [...] there an nearly 800,000 inhabitants in Paris, you see clearly that [...] there must be many heads which have an equal number <b>of</b> <b>hairs,</b> though [...] I have not counted them. Still Mme. de Longueville could never [...] comprehend that this equality <b>of</b> <b>hairs</b> could be demonstrated, and [...] always maintained that the only way of proving it was to count them.” ...|$|R
5|$|The maximum {{terminal}} hair length {{depends on}} the length of the anagen (period <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> growth) for the individual. Waist-length hair or longer is only possible to reach for people with long anagen. The anagen lasts between 2 and 7 years, for some individuals even longer, and is followed by shorter catagen (transition) and telogen (resting) periods. At any given time, about 85% <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> strands are in anagen. The fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF5) gene affects the hair cycle in mammals including humans; blocking FGF5 in the human scalp (by applying a herbal extract that blocked FGF5) extends the hair cycle, resulting in less hair fall and increased hair growth.|$|E

For meat and hide producers, hair sheep are cheaper to keep, as they do not need shearing. Hair sheep are also more {{resistant}} to parasites and hot weather.|$|E

5|$|A myth {{which is}} trait-based, though genetically impossible, {{is the idea}} that the modern Maine Coon descended from {{ancestors}} of semi-feral domestic cats and raccoons. This myth is likely based on the common color of the breed (brown tabby) and its bushy tail. Another idea is that the Maine Coon originated from the matings of domestic cats and wild bobcats, which could explain the tufts <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> that are so commonly seen on the tips of the ears.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{features}} found with Nasodigitoacoustic syndrome {{can be managed}} or treated. Sensorineural hearing loss in humans {{may be caused by}} a loss <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> cells (sensory receptors in the inner ear that are associated with hearing). This can be hereditary and/or within a syndrome, {{as is the case with}} nasodigitoacoustic syndrome, or attributed to infections such as viruses. For the management of sensorineural hearing loss, hearing aids have been used. Treatments, depending upon the cause and severity, may include a pharmacological approach (i.e., the use of certain steroids), or surgical intervention, like a cochlear implant.|$|E
5|$|As {{the wing}} develops, the dorsal and ventral integumental layers become closely apposed {{over most of}} their area forming the wing membrane. The {{remaining}} areas form channels, the future veins, in which the nerves and tracheae may occur. The cuticle surrounding the veins becomes thickened and more heavily sclerotized to provide strength and rigidity to the wing. Two types <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> may occur on the wings: microtrichia, which are small and irregularly scattered, and macrotrichia, which are larger, socketed, and may be restricted to veins. The scales of Lepidoptera and Trichoptera are highly modified macrotrichia.|$|E

40|$|The {{morphological}} deformations <b>of</b> root <b>hairs</b> in trifoliate orange {{grafted with}} satsuma mandarin (Citrus unshiu Marc. cv.

The hair zone positioned {{apart from the}} root tip before treatments which gradually proceeded nearer the root tip under only high temperature stress. However, the speed of this effect was so slow that even after 25 days <b>of</b> exposure the <b>hair</b> zone was {{not found to be}} completely proximal to the root tip. The elongation <b>of</b> <b>hairs</b> was noticed within 5 days which gradually deformed and after 25 days of exposure almost all the hairs were degraded. In contrast, at high temperature accompanied low soil moisture condition, hair zone appeared extremely nearer the root tip within 5 days followed by the random occurrence <b>of</b> <b>hairs</b> from root tip up to a certain distance towards the base. Although slightly elongation <b>of</b> <b>hairs</b> was found at the initial stage, severe degradation ensued at the following sampling dates. As the consequences, after 25 days of treatment the complete destruction <b>of</b> <b>hairs</b> occurred where only the traces <b>of</b> abolished <b>hairs</b> were left. In general, only the high temperature stress primarily resulted the formation <b>of</b> dense <b>hairs</b> but this dense hair formation was instantly inhibited as the interactive effects of high temperature and low soil moisture stress...|$|R

5|$|Because of {{morphological}} similarities, the Sumatran rhinoceros {{is believed}} to be closely related to the extinct woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis). The woolly rhinoceros, so named for the coat <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> it shares with the Sumatran rhinoceros, first appeared in China; by the Upper Pleistocene, it ranged across the Eurasian continent from Korea to Spain. The woolly rhinoceros survived the last Ice Age, but, like the woolly mammoth, most or all became extinct around 10,000 years ago. Although some morphological studies questioned the relationship, recent molecular analysis has supported the two species as sister taxa.|$|E
