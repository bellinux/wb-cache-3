Over the past 20 years, infrared use has consistently decreased; fiber optic demand, however, is slowly increasing. In America, 30–50% of current fiber optic lines are unused dark fiber, sparking discussion of <b>over-production</b> and a future reduction in demand. Worldwide, demand is increasing dramatically as countries such as China are installing fiber optic telecommunication lines throughout the country.|$|E

Like the 'functioning' endocrine cancers described below, acinar cell carcinomas may cause <b>over-production</b> of certain molecules, in this case digestive enzymes, which may cause symptoms such as skin rashes and joint pain.|$|E
5|$|In {{the twentieth}} century Scottish {{agriculture}} became susceptible to world markets. There were dramatic price rises in the First World War, but a slump in the 1920s and 1930s, followed by more rises in the Second World War. In 1947 annual price reviews were introduced {{in an attempt to}} stabilise the market. There was a drive in UK agriculture to greater production until the late 1970s, resulting in intensive farming and increasing mechanisation. The UK joined the European Economic Community in 1972. Some sectors became viable only with subsidies. A series of reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy from the 1990s attempted to control <b>over-production,</b> limit incentives for intensive farming and mitigate environmental damage. A dual farm structure emerged with large commercial farms and small pluralised and diversified holdings.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, 76–77 {{per cent}} of output by value was {{livestock}} farming and, although this {{has fallen to}} about 64 per cent since 1990, arable farming remains {{a minority of the}} sector and two-thirds of agricultural land is rough pasture. One result is that chemicalisation and arable-based subsidies have had less impact on Scottish biodiversity than is the case in England where farming is overwhelmingly arable. The UK membership of the European Economic Community (later the European Union) in 1972 began a re-orientation for Scottish farming. A preference for Commonwealth markets was replaced by EU obligations. Agriculture became dominated by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the EU, which made farming dependent on market support and direct grants to farmers. As a result, some sectors, particularly hill sheep farming, became viable only with subsidies. Eight-four per cent of Scottish land qualified for extra support as a Less Favoured Area (LFA), but 80 per cent of the payments were going to only 20 per cent of the farmers, mainly large commercial arable farms in the Lowlands. A series of reforms to the CAP from the 1990s attempted to control <b>over-production,</b> limit incentives for intensive farming and mitigate environmental damage. As part of an attempt to mitigate the depopulation and commercialisation of Scottish farming, the Crofting Act of 1976 made it easier for crofters to buy their farms, but most were insufficient to support a family, and many small farmers turned to fish farming and tourism to supplement their incomes. A dual farm structure has emerged with agriculture divided between large commercial farms and small pluralised and diversified holdings. Scotland has the highest average farm size in the European Union, almost ten times the average.|$|E
25|$|In {{the common}} Mediterranean variant, {{mutations}} decrease {{production of the}} β-chain (β-thalassemia). In α-thalassemia, which is relatively frequent in Africa and several other countries, production of the α-chain of hemoglobin is impaired, and there is relative <b>over-production</b> of the β-chain. Individuals homozygous for β-thalassemia have severe anemia and are unlikely to survive and reproduce, so selection against the gene is strong. Those homozygous for α-thalassemia also suffer from anemia {{and there is some}} degree of selection against the gene.|$|E
25|$|The Southern Song period saw {{the finest}} quality, {{and a great}} range of colours, {{as well as a}} great {{expansion}} of production. A count in 1988 by a Chinese archaeologist of the starts of new kilns gave 39 from the Northern Song, 61 from the Southern Song, and over 70 from the Yuan. Interestingly, the percentage figures for those still producing in the 20th century were 23%, <10% and <5%, indicating a bubble of <b>over-production,</b> which only the strongest kilns survived.|$|E
25|$|In {{his review}} (collected in The Present as History, 1953) Marxist Paul Sweezy joked that Hayek {{would have you}} believe that if there was an <b>over-production</b> of baby carriages, the central {{planners}} would then order the population to have more babies instead of simply warehousing the temporary excess of carriages and decreasing production for next year. The cybernetic arguments of Stafford Beer in his 1974 CBC Massey Lectures, Designing Freedom – that intelligent adaptive planning can increase freedom – are of interest in this regard, as is the technical work of Herbert A. Simon and Albert Ando on the dynamics of hierarchical nearly decomposable systems in economics – namely, that everything in such a system is not tightly coupled to everything else.|$|E
25|$|The Bruce {{plant was}} {{commissioned}} in 1979 to provide heavy {{water for a}} large increase in Ontario's nuclear power generation. The plants were significantly more efficient than planned and {{only three of the}} planned four units were eventually commissioned. In addition, the nuclear power programme was slowed down and effectively stopped due to a perceived oversupply of electricity, later shown to be temporary, in 1993. Improved efficiency in the use and recycling of heavy water plus the <b>over-production</b> at Bruce left Canada with enough heavy water for its anticipated future needs. Also, the Girdler process involves large amounts of hydrogen sulfide, raising environmental concerns if there should be a release. The Bruce heavy water plant was shut down in 1997, after which the plant was gradually dismantled and the site cleared.|$|E
25|$|Industrialist Albert Pope was {{inspired}} by a British-made, high-wheeled bicycle (called a velocipede) that he saw at the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exposition, and he bought patent rights for bicycle production in the United States. He wanted to contract out his first order, however, so he approached George Fairfield of Weed Sewing Machine Company, who produced Pope's first run of bicycles in 1878. Bicycles proved to be a huge commercial success, and production expanded in the Weed factory, with Weed making every part but the tires. Demand for bicycles overshadowed the failing sewing machine market by 1890, so Pope bought the Weed factory, took over as its president, and renamed it the Pope Manufacturing Company. The bicycle boom was short-lived, peaking near {{the turn of the century}} when more and more consumers craved individual automobile travel, and Pope's company suffered financially from <b>over-production</b> amidst falling demand.|$|E

500|$|Almost {{from its}} {{inception}} the second MacDonald administration was overwhelmed by the twin crises of rising unemployment {{and the world trade}} recession that followed the financial crash {{in the latter part of}} 1929. The Labour Party was divided; the Chancellor, Philip Snowden, favoured a strict curb on public expenditure, while others, including Wilkinson, believed that the problem was not <b>over-production,</b> but under-consumption. [...] The solution, she argued, lay in increasing, not squeezing, the spending power of the poorest in society. On the issue of unemployment, Wilkinson supported Oswald Mosley's [...] "Memorandum", a plan for economic reconstruction and public works that was rejected by the government on the grounds of cost; Mosley resigned from the government in protest.|$|E
500|$|Dear Agony {{received}} mixed critical reception. AllMusic's James Monger {{gave the}} album a positive review, stating it [...] "feels {{a lot like}} their first three", noting a consistency that [...] "feels like a well-oiled machine." [...] The disc received a negative review from Consequence of Sound's Alex Young, who complained of <b>over-production</b> and the disc's sell-out nature {{at the hands of}} three-time Breaking Benjamin producer David Bendeth: [...] "Dear Agony is the unfortunate side effect of a trend in 'producer' David Bendeth's world, training wild chimpanzees to be more tasteful whilst handling silverware", ultimately giving the record a half-star [...] "for teaching Breaking Benjamin's peers who not to hire for production credit." [...] About Entertainment gave the record a mixed review, feeling that [...] "Though it lacks the breakthrough singles of Phobia, Dear Agony does have its moments," [...] adding, [...] "frustratingly, Dear Agony never reaches greatness, settling for an admirable competency that's still the envy of many of their contemporaries." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{introduction}} of new grape varieties, grafted onto American rootstocks, the vineyards were built up again between 1901 and 1905. In spite of these measures, the decline continued with a series of crises caused firstly by the collapse of stock market prices in 1906–1907, then by <b>over-production</b> in 1922–1923. It was only after the Second World War that the tide began to turn, thanks to improvements in quality due to the use of [...] "noble" [...] grape varieties, and increased demand for quality effervescent wines as an alternative to Champagne. The growth of tourism was also a crucial in boosting sales of the wine produced.|$|E
2500|$|In 1917, Buckland {{wrote to}} Cecil B. DeMille expressing his dissatisfaction over having his artistic vision stifled. [...] He said, [...] "I came to Hollywood ... {{in search of}} a chance to {{visualize}} a more 'pictorial' way, by adapting to film the same rules that govern the higher art of painting." [...] Buckland also complained in the press that the art director's job, like that of the actor, suffered from <b>over-production.</b> [...] Buckland noted that he had supervised 56 pictures in a single year and added, [...] "Studio necessities compel him to supervise the art work on a number of productions at one time. [...] As a consequence, the art director becomes an architect, or perhaps merely a scenic artist, instead of the illustrator of the dramatic story." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many argue, however, {{that the}} quality of Kunisada's later works {{degraded}} into [...] "gaudy and ostentatious" [...] use of colour, and [...] "lost... elegance in the human figure". Ukiyo-e specialist Rupert Faulkner is particularly scathing, asserting that Kunisada's work [...] "became noticeably coarser and somewhat clumsy, revealing a cheap and gaudy caricaturism of grotesque facial expressions and exaggerated poses." [...] It has been suggested that his production generally suffered [...] "because of <b>over-production</b> and lowering of artistic standards," [...] as well as possible mental or physical health issues, which led to Kunisada becoming a near-recluse in 1847. As art historian J. Hillier notes, [...] "Kunisada’s career tells the tragedy of the downfall of ukiyo-e. With evident talent and tremendous verve, his early prints have qualities that link him with the great days of the school, but the great mass of his prints are hastily designed, over-coloured and badly printed." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{his review}} for Rolling Stone magazine, Jody Rosen found {{most of the}} album's songs [...] "unforgettable" [...] and stated, [...] "the {{combination}} of classicist songcraft, wild sound collage and a muse that partakes equally of the sensual and the silly makes Love vs. Money far {{more than just an}} accomplished genre piece". Alex Macpherson of The Quietus noted its cyclical thematic structure, but stated, [...] "it's how the wheel turns, endlessly and inevitably, which is what compels about Love vs Money." [...] Slant Magazine's Wilson McBee viewed it as an improvement over Love Hate and wrote that it [...] "keeps to the same aesthetic touchstones [...] while cranking up the gears of ambition". McBee called the album [...] "a cohesive, front-to-back artistic statement" [...] and commented on its studio and hook-oriented [...] "songcraft": [...] "What keeps all this <b>over-production</b> from being distracting is Nash's intelligent arrangements and a keen avoidance of clutter." ...|$|E
2500|$|Overall, Farther Along had a {{much less}} {{cluttered}} sound than its predecessor, as guitarist and band leader Roger McGuinn noted to journalist David Fricke in 2000: [...] "It was as live {{as you can get}} in the studio. We didn't do a lot of overdubs, mostly just the vocals." [...] Nonetheless, while the album succeeded in countering the <b>over-production</b> present on Byrdmaniax, the band themselves weren't particularly satisfied with the finished product. [...] In a 1997 interview, bass player Skip Battin expressed his dissatisfaction with the album by saying [...] "When we finished it, I didn't think we had anything, I thought the stuff was rotten - it didn't sound good, it was scattered and there was no unification." [...] Drummer Gene Parsons concurred with Battin's assessment of the album, stating [...] "I felt that Farther Along was a good album, but it was under produced. It was done really rapidly and it suffered in under production as a reaction to Byrdmaniax." ...|$|E
2500|$|Farther Along is the 11th album by the American {{rock band}} The Byrds and was {{released}} in November 1971 on Columbia Records (see 1971 in music). [...] For the most part, the album was recorded and produced by The Byrds themselves in London, England, {{over the course of}} five work-intensive days in July 1971. [...] It was quickly released as a reaction to the commercial failure of The Byrds' previous album, Byrdmaniax, and as an attempt to stem the criticism that album was receiving in the music press. [...] Byrdmaniax had suffered from excessive and inappropriate orchestration, which producer Terry Melcher had applied to the album, allegedly without the band's consent. [...] As such, Farther Along {{can be seen as the}} band's answer to Melcher's <b>over-production</b> as well as an attempt to prove that they could produce an album superior to Byrdmaniax themselves. [...] Unfortunately, the rapidity with which The Byrds planned and recorded Farther Along resulted in yet another uneven LP, which the band themselves were unhappy with and which failed to undo the damage to their reputation inflicted by Byrdmaniax.|$|E
2500|$|The lack {{of success}} of Stevens' second album {{mirrored}} a difference of personal tastes in musical direction, and a growing resentment of producer Mike Hurst's attempts to re-create another album like that of his debut, with heavy-handed orchestration, and <b>over-production,</b> rather than the folk rock sound Stevens was attempting to produce. [...] He admits having purposefully sabotaged his own contract with Hurst, making outlandishly expensive orchestral demands and threatening legal action, which resulted in his goal: release from his contract with Deram Records, a sub-label of Decca Records. Upon regaining his health at home after his release from the hospital, Stevens recorded some of his newly written songs on his tape recorder, and played his changing sound for a few new record executives. After hiring agent Barry Krost, who had arranged for an audition with Chris Blackwell of Island Records, Blackwell offered him a [...] "chance to record [...] whenever and with whomever he liked, and more importantly to Cat, however he liked". With Krost's recommendation, Stevens signed with Paul Samwell-Smith, previously the bassist of the Yardbirds, to be his new producer.|$|E
2500|$|The band {{themselves}} {{were far from}} happy with the album and upon its release, were vocal in press interviews about their dissatisfaction. [...] Even two years later, Clarence White complained to journalist Pete Frame that [...] "Terry Melcher put strings on while {{we were on the}} road, we came back and we didn't even recognize it as our own album." [...] Gene Parsons disowned the album completely, describing it as [...] "Melcher's folly" [...] and commenting in interviews that the band were all appalled by what they heard when they returned from touring. [...] McGuinn actually defended Melcher somewhat by indicating {{in an interview with the}} English journalist Keith Altham that the album had been taken away from the producer at the last minute and given to an engineer in San Francisco to remix. [...] However, the production credits on the original LP sleeve do not support McGuinn's claim and Melcher later stated that he had no recollection of the album being mixed by anyone other than himself. [...] In more recent years, McGuinn has conceded to journalist David Fricke that the album's shortcomings were not down to Melcher's <b>over-production</b> alone: [...] "We were just idling artistically, the album sounds like we really weren't concentrating on doing good work, good art." ...|$|E

6000|$|It {{will be here}} {{noticed that}} Mr. Mill uses demand in the sense for [...] which we contended it should be used (Book III, Chap. I, § 3), and [...] not as “quantity demanded.” The present {{discussion}} of [...] <b>over-production</b> should also be connected by the student with the [...] former reference to it, Book I, Chap. IV, § 2.|$|E
6000|$|But {{in regard}} to demand and supply of {{particular}} commodities (not [...] general demand and supply), the increase of the demand is not [...] necessarily followed by an increased supply, or vice versa. Out [...] of the total production (which constitutes general demand) a [...] varying amount, sometimes more, sometimes less, may be directed by [...] the desires of men to the purchase of some given thing. This [...] should be borne in mind, {{in connection with the}} future discussion [...] of <b>over-production.</b> The identity of general demand with general [...] supply shows there can be no general over-production: but so long [...] as there exists the possibility that the demand for a particular [...] commodity may diminish without a corresponding effect being [...] thereby produced on the supply of that commodity, by a necessary [...] connection, we see that there may be <b>over-production</b> of particular [...] commodities; that is, a production in excess of the demand.|$|E
60|$|Because the {{phenomenon}} of over-supply and consequent inconvenience or loss to the producer or dealer may exist {{in the case of}} any one commodity whatever, many persons, including some distinguished political economists,(255) have thought that it may exist with regard to all commodities; {{that there may be a}} general <b>over-production</b> of wealth; a supply of commodities in the aggregate surpassing the demand; and a consequent depressed condition of all classes of producers.|$|E
6000|$|Malthus {{also wrote}} “Principles of Political Economy” (1821) and [...] “Definitions in Political Economy” (1827), but the former did not [...] {{increase}} his reputation. He believed in taxing imported corn, and he [...] gave in his {{adherence to the}} doctrine of <b>over-production.</b> But, on [...] the other hand, {{he was one of}} several writers who, almost at the [...] same time, discovered the true theory of rent. His father was a [...] friend of Godwin, and a correspondent of Rousseau. (See Bagehot, [...] “Economic Studies,” p. 135.) ...|$|E
60|$|This is {{the truth}} which the deniers of general <b>over-production</b> have seized and enforced; nor is it pretended that {{anything}} {{has been added to}} it, or subtracted from it, in the present disquisition. But it is thought that those who receive the doctrine accompanied with the explanations which we have given, will understand, more clearly than before, what is, and what is not, implied in it; and will see that, when properly understood, it in no way contradicts those obvious facts which are universally known and admitted to be not only of possible, but of actual and even frequent occurrence. The doctrine in question only appears a paradox, because it has usually been so expressed as apparently to contradict these well-known facts; which, however, were equally well known to the authors of the doctrine, who, therefore, can only have adopted from inadvertence any form of expression which could to a candid person appear inconsistent with it. The essentials of the doctrine are preserved when it is allowed that there cannot be permanent excess of production, or of accumulation; though it be at the same time admitted, that as there may be a temporary excess of any one article considered separately, so may there of commodities generally, not in consequence of <b>over-production,</b> but of a want of commercial confidence.|$|E
6000|$|But {{in reality}} this paradox of value {{is the most}} {{fundamental}} proposition in economic science. Precisely here is found {{the key to the}} operation of the economic society in which we live. The world's production is aimed at producing [...] "values," [...] not in producing plenty. If by some mad access of misdirected industry we produced enough and too much of everything, our whole machinery of buying and selling would break down. This indeed does happen constantly on a small scale in the familiar phenomenon of <b>over-production.</b> But in the organization in which we live <b>over-production</b> tends to check itself at once. If the world's machinery threatens to produce a too great plenty of any particular thing, then it turns itself towards producing something else of which there is not yet enough. This is done quite unconsciously without any philanthropic intent {{on the part of the}} individual producer and without any general direction in the way of a social command. The machine does it of itself. When there is enough the wheels slacken and stop. This sounds at first hearing most admirable. But let it be noted that the [...] "enough" [...] here in question does not mean enough to satisfy human wants. In fact it means precisely the converse. It means enough not to satisfy them, and to leave the selling price of the things made at the point of profit.|$|E
6000|$|... “This <b>over-production,</b> {{which is}} not {{transient}} but permanent, nay, is [...] constantly on the increase, evidences a diseased state of the [...] national industry, a perverted application of industrial powers, and [...] {{is a far more}} pungent satire on the national condition than all the [...] poverty of operatives and peasants. [...] . Other nations need not envy [...] us the preponderance of the intellectual proletariat over the [...] proletaires of manual labor. For man more easily becomes diseased [...] from over-study than from the labor of the hands; and it is precisely [...] in the intellectual proletariat that there are the most dangerous [...] seeds of disease. This is the group in which the opposition between [...] earnings and wants, between the ideal social position and the real, [...] is the most hopelessly irreconcilable.” ...|$|E
60|$|It is {{impossible}} to contest these propositions as thus stated. But there is one consideration which clearly shews, {{that there is something}} more in the matter than is here taken into the account; and this is, that the above reasoning tends distinctly to prove, that it does a tradesman no good to go into his shop and buy his goods. How can he be enriched? it might be asked. He merely receives a certain value in money, for an equivalent value in goods. Neither does this give employment to his capital; for there never exists more capital than can find employment, and if one person does not buy his goods another will; or if nobody does, there is <b>over-production</b> in that business, he can remove his capital, and find employment for it in another trade.|$|E
