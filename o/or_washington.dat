5|$|The {{most recent}} {{sighting}} {{of a sea}} otter off the Oregon coast took place on 18 February 2009, in Depoe Bay, Oregon. The lone male sea otter could have traveled from either California <b>or</b> <b>Washington.</b>|$|E
5|$|Due to Fort Corcoran's {{large size}} and {{proximity}} to Georgetown, duty {{as part of}} the fort's garrison was less of a hardship than it was at many of the more isolated forts in the defenses of Washington, such as Fort Greble. Morale and sanitation officers often visited Fort Corcoran, and leave to visit Georgetown <b>or</b> <b>Washington</b> was sometimes granted to both officers and enlisted men. Men at the fort served in regimental bands or played baseball in their spare time between periods of infantry and gunnery drill. Due to Fort Corcoran's location behind the Arlington Line, however, drill was not as intense as at many front-line fort.|$|E
5|$|Of the 71 players picked in {{the first}} round by Montreal <b>or</b> <b>Washington,</b> 36 have been pitchers, the most of any position; 25 of them were right-handed, while 11 were left-handed. Thirteen outfielders, ten shortstops, five third basemen, four catchers, and three first basemen were also taken. The team has never drafted a player at second base. In all, 40 of the players were drafted from high school, 27 from {{four-year}} colleges, and four from junior colleges. Eleven of the players came from high schools, universities, or junior colleges in the state of California, and Florida follows with 10 players. They have also drafted two players from Puerto Rico: Josue Estrada (1993) and Hiram Bocachica (1994).|$|E

5|$|Twelve players born {{outside the}} {{jurisdiction}} of the United States, plus two players born in U.S. insular areas (territories), have made either the first or second All-Defensive Team—Manute Bol, born in a part of Sudan that is now the independent nation of South Sudan; Hakeem Olajuwon of Nigeria; Patrick Ewing of Jamaica; Dikembe Mutombo of the Democratic Republic of the Congo; Andrei Kirilenko, born in the portion of the former Soviet Union that is now Russia; Anderson Varejão of Brazil; Thabo Sefolosha of Switzerland; Duncan and Raja Bell of the U.S. Virgin Islands; Luol Deng, a naturalized citizen of the United Kingdom born in what is now South Sudan; Serge Ibaka, born in the Republic of the Congo and naturalized in Spain; Marc Gasol, born and primarily raised in Spain; Rudy Gobert of France; and Giannis Antetokoumpo of Greece. Ewing, Olajuwon, and Kirilenko are naturalized U.S. citizens, and Duncan and Bell are U.S. citizens by birth, but they are still considered international players by the NBA because they were not born in one of the fifty states <b>or</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C.|$|E
5|$|Some sections, such as Metro, {{are only}} {{found in the}} editions of the paper {{distributed}} in the New York–New Jersey–Connecticut Tri-state area {{and not in the}} national <b>or</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C. editions. Aside from a weekly roundup of reprints of editorial cartoons from other newspapers, The New York Times does not have its own staff editorial cartoonist, nor does it feature a comics page or Sunday comics section. In September 2008, The New York Times announced that it would be combining certain sections effective October 6, 2008, in editions printed in the New York metropolitan area. The changes folded the Metro Section into the main International / National news section and combined Sports and Business (except Saturday through Monday, when Sports is still printed as a standalone section). This change also included having the name of the Metro section be called New York outside of the Tri-State Area. The presses used by The New York Times allow four sections to be printed simultaneously; as the paper had included more than four sections all days except Saturday, the sections had to be printed separately in an early press run and collated together. The changes will allow The New York Times to print in four sections Monday through Wednesday, in addition to Saturday. The New York Times announcement stated that the number of news pages and employee positions will remain unchanged, with the paper realizing cost savings by cutting overtime expenses.|$|E
5|$|Tornado watches {{were issued}} for the Atlantic coast from Pennsylvania to Florida {{at the start}} of the day and {{continued}} through the morning and early afternoon, but tornadoes were forecasted to generally be weaker and more isolated. Despite this, the secondary portion of the outbreak that had begun producing scattered tornadoes throughout the Mid-Atlantic and East Coast regions the previous evening intensified during the early hours of the morning, producing numerous tornadoes in Pennsylvania, New York, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and Maryland. While most were weak, some of the tornadoes that struck portions of Virginia, New York, and Pennsylvania were strong. Although tornado watches were issued, no tornadoes were spotted in New Jersey <b>or</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C. In the wake of the tornadoes and severe thunderstorms, widespread flooding hit the Midwest, South, and Eastern Seaboard, with extensive flood and flash flood warnings issued. One particularly damaging and deadly EF3 tornado struck the town of Glade Spring, Virginia very early in the morning, where three people died. The last tornadoes of the outbreak touched down that afternoon in eastern North Carolina, which was hard hit in the April 16 outbreak, though the tornadoes that impacted the area this time around were weak. The system moved out into the Atlantic Ocean that evening, with the exception of isolated thunderstorms over central Florida that night into April 29, although there were no tornadoes then.|$|E

25|$|O'Neill {{was born}} on February 2, 1860, either in St. Louis, Missouri, <b>or</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C., {{although}} he sometimes listed Ireland as his birthplace.

25|$|Wallace, who had {{returned}} to active duty on March 12, 1864, assumed command of VIII Corps, which was headquartered in Baltimore. On July 9, a combined Union force of approximately 5,800 men under Wallace's command (mostly hundred-days' men from VIII Corps) and a division under James B. Ricketts from VI Corps encountered Confederate troops at Monocacy Junction between 9 and 10 a.m. Although Wallace was uncertain whether Baltimore <b>or</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C. was the Confederate objective, he knew his troops would have to delay the advance until Union reinforcements arrived. Wallace's men repelled the Confederate attacks {{for more than six}} hours before retreating to Baltimore.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, Dr. Bigg {{submitted}} his report, {{indicating that}} the rate of captures from such a small population was unsustainable and recommending restrictions on the capture of killer whales from Canadian waters. The same year, the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service conducted a killer whale survey in the Washington coast, which also yielded low numbers, and public opinion had begun to turn against whale capture. Since 1976, no killer whales in British Columbia <b>or</b> <b>Washington</b> waters have been taken for captivity, with the exception of Miracle, a young killer whale that had been discovered starving and with bullet wounds. Killer whales for aquarium display continued to be taken from Iceland until 1989, when that country banned further captures. Since that time, killer whale populations at marine parks have been in decline with only a few small-scale captures that have occurred in Argentina, Japan, and Russia.|$|E
