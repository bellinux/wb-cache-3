Normally, he would break some of those runs. I don't think he quite had his third gear today." [...] Steffy played a solid first half, but in the second, threw two interceptions before {{suffering}} a season-ending thumb fracture. He was replaced by back-up Chris Turner who started {{for the remainder of the}} season. Regarding their loss, Delaware head coach K.C. Keeler said, [...] "This is not like a moral victory. I don't believe in moral victories... This was not a payday for us... We play a home game, we make more money than playing this game down here. When we scheduled this game, I thought <b>our</b> <b>program</b> would possibly be in a position to beat a solid ACC school." ...|$|E

In a June 2008 interview initiated and arranged by his publicist, he promoted his book Churchill, Hitler and the Unnecessary War. During the broadcast, Buchanan defended Charles Lindbergh against charges of antisemitism, stating that his reputation [...] "has been blackened because of a single speech he gave {{and a couple of}} paragraphs in it where he said that... the Jewish community is beating the drums for warbut frankly, no one has said what he said was palpably untrue." [...] At the end of the interview, James Edwards said, [...] "Mr. Buchanan, {{thank you so much for}} coming back on <b>our</b> <b>program,</b> for fighting for our people." [...] Previously, in September 2006, Buchanan had made an appearance to promote his book State of Emergency; during this interview, he said that [...] "we are being invaded by people of different cultures" [...] and argued that Americans [...] "cannot survive a bifurcated culture or a heavily Hispanicized culture, tilted towards Mexico...

He said to Scout.com, [...] "I decided to be a Nittany Lion because I {{felt it was a}} great fit for me. Penn State has great academics as well as a great basketball team and that's what I was looking for." [...] Frazier also said that he had a [...] "great time" [...] on his official visit and all his relatives supported the decision. He received offers from various other schools across the country, including Bradley, Colorado State, New Mexico State, Santa Clara, Stanford, Stephen F. Austin, and UTEP. Frazier was also visited by San Diego, TCU, and Penn State, spanning from September to October 2008. After the move was made official, head coach Ed DeChellis said, [...] "We are very excited to have Tim join <b>our</b> <b>program.</b> He is a very fast, quick player with tremendous speed in the backcourt and a good shooter. He possesses the kind of athleticism that Stanley Pringle does. He can get in the lane and find open guys and is a great drive and kick passer and he can score. He is a very good on-the-ball defender and a tremendous athlete and we think he really solidifies our backcourt for the future." ...|$|E

If we lost in the Committee of the Whole, then we would usually offer it as a motion to recommit and get a vote on that. And if we lost on the motion to recommit, our Republican members had a choice: They could vote against the Johnson program and say we did our best {{to come up with a}} better alternative. Or they could vote for it and make the same argument. Usually we lost; but when you're only 140 out of 435, you don't expect to win many.|$|E

Of the band's role, Geiger said, [...] "Although the Band {{did not cause}} the Play, it was typical {{that they would have}} been in the wrong place at the wrong time."

Dr. Chris Blagg has stated that the first training predated the establishment of the home program: the [...] "first home patient wasn’t part of <b>our</b> <b>program</b> at all, he was president of a big Indian corporation, lived in Madras, and he came to Seattle just before I came in ’63.

If there had been no Government program, if the old order had obtained in 1933 and 1934, that drought on the cattle ranges of America and in the corn belt would have resulted in the marketing of thin cattle, immature hogs and the death of these animals on the range and on the farm, and if the old order had been in effect those years, we would have had a vastly greater shortage than we face today. <b>Our</b> <b>program</b> – we can prove it – saved the lives of millions of head of livestock.

2500|$|By {{the time}} of the German {{invasion}} in 1939, antisemitism was escalating, and hostility towards Jews was a mainstay of the right-wing political forces post-Piłsudski regime and also the Catholic Church. Discrimination and violence against Jews had rendered the Polish Jewish population increasingly destitute, as was the case throughout much of Central and Eastern Europe. Despite the impending threat to the Polish Republic from Nazi Germany, there was little effort seen in the way of reconciliation with Poland's Jewish population. In July 1939 the pro-government Gazeta Polska wrote, [...] "The fact that our relations with the Reich are worsening does not in the least deactivate <b>our</b> <b>program</b> in the Jewish question—there is not and cannot be any common ground between our internal Jewish problem and Poland's relations with the Hitlerite Reich." [...] Escalating hostility towards Polish Jews and an official Polish government desire to remove Jews from Poland continued until the German invasion of Poland.|$|E

2500|$|Having lost 20 {{million people}} in the war, {{suffered}} German invasion through Poland twice in 30 years, and suffered tens of millions of casualties from onslaughts from the West three times in the preceding 150 years, the Soviet Union was determined to destroy Germany's capacity for another war. This was in alignment with the U.S. policy which had foreseen returning Germany to a pastoral state without heavy industry (the Morgenthau Plan). On September 6, 1946, James F. Byrnes made a speech in Germany, repudiating the Morgenthau Plan and warning the Soviets that the US intended to maintain a military presence in Europe indefinitely. (see Restatement of Policy on Germany) As Byrnes admitted one month later, [...] "The nub of <b>our</b> <b>program</b> was to win the German people [...] it was a battle between us and Russia over minds [...] " [...] Because of the increasing costs of food imports to avoid mass-starvation in Germany, and with the danger of losing the entire nation to communism, the U.S. government abandoned the Morgenthau plan in September 1946 with Secretary of State James F.
