50|$|Although {{uncommon}} {{compared to}} most applications, sometimes a seasoning solution is sprayed directly onto ramen noodles {{to enhance their}} flavor, prior to being packaged. Flavor ingredients used in instant ramen noodle soup include dried vegetables and meats, salt, MSG, onion, garlic, yeast extract, hydrolyzed vegetable protein, essential oil extracts and natural or synthetic flavor compounds. Essential oils derived from onion, garlic and clove are sometimes used as flavorants for instant ramen soup, and may be manufactured using expeller pressing or solvent extraction and distillation. Sophisticated methods exist that create flavor compounds, or complex flavors, for the flavoring of instant ramen noodle soups, in which volatile compounds from substances are isolated and reconstituted to create seasoning blends. Techniques to create flavor compounds for instant ramen soups include gas chromatography utilized with mass spectrometry and <b>olfactometry.</b> Ramen noodle soup seasoning packets may also contain anticaking agents and flow agents to prevent the product from clumping into a solid mass.|$|E
50|$|To {{establish}} the odor concentration, an olfactometer test is used, which employs {{a panel of}} human noses as sensors. In the <b>olfactometry</b> testing procedure, a diluted odorous mixture and an odor-free gas (as a reference) are presented separately from sniffing ports {{to a group of}} panelists, who are housed in an odor-neutral room. They are asked to compare the gases emitted from each sniffing port, after which the panelists are asked to report the presence of odor together with a confidence level such as guessing, inkling, or certainty of their assessment. The gas-diluting ratio is then decreased by a factor of two (i.e. chemical concentration is increased by a factor of two). The panelists are then asked to repeat their judgment. This continues for a number of dilution levels. The responses of the panelists over a range of dilution settings are used to calculate the concentration of the Odor in terms of European odor units (ouE/m³). The main panel calibration gas used is butan-1-ol, which at a certain diluting gives 1 ouE/m³.|$|E

40|$|Livestock {{facilities}} have received numerous criticisms {{due to their}} emissions of odorous air and chemicals.

Odor emission factors are used as inputs to odor setback models, while chemical emission factors may be compared with regulations to demonstrate possible health impacts. Additional measurements were incorporated into the National Air Emissions Monitoring Study (NAEMS) to establish odor and chemical emission factors for confined animal feeding operations. This investigation was conducted by the University of Minnesota, Iowa State University, West Texas A 2 ̆ 6 M University, and Purdue University.

40|$|<b>Olfactometry</b> is {{a precise}} testing method. How precise {{depends on the}} quality {{assurance}} / quality control (QA/QC) statistics associated with the laboratory’s results. The European <b>Olfactometry</b> testing standard, EN 13725 : 2003, provides a formalized method for monitoring the performance of panel members (assessors) and test results. This is accomplished through testing with the standard odorant 1 -butanol (n-butanol). <b>Olfactometry</b> precision can be understood through four different variance values: 1. specific panel variance, 2. within panel variance, 3. inter-panel variance, and 4. inter-laboratory variance.

In this study, combining the data from gas chromatography-olfactometry with mass spectrometry (GC-O/MS) and comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC x GC-TOFMS) using retention indices (RIs) was used for the identification of odorants in HP source water. <b>Olfactometry</b> peaks detected in water extracts by GC-O/MS were combined with the chromatography peaks detected by GC x GC-TOFMS based on the RIs determined using the retention times (RTs) of alkanes C 7 -C 30. A total of thirteen <b>olfactometry</b> peaks were obtained though GC-O/MS analysis, and potential odorants corresponding to each of the <b>olfactometry</b> peaks were screened based on the odor characteristics and match similarity using GC x GC-TOFMS. Finally, fourteen odorants (one odorant was detected in GC x GC-TOFMS without an <b>olfactometry</b> peak), including three septic odorants (bis(2 -chloroisopropyl) ether, diethyl disulfide and dimethyl disulfide) and two musty ones (geosmin and 2 -MIB), were confirmed by using authentic standards. The septic and musty odorants in six source water samples taken over a period of six months were quantified. Bis(2 -chloroisopropyl) ether, with an odor activity value (OAV) of 1. 84 - 3. 2, was found to be a major septic odorant in HP source water, followed by diethyl disulfide (OAV 1. 56 - 1. 96) and dimethyl disulfide (OAV 0. 37 - 2. 42), while geosmin (OAV 4. 37 - 11. 44) was the major musty odorant, followed by 2 -MIB (OAV 1. 13 - 1. 89). This is the first comprehensive study focusing on the identification of odorants in a complex source water.

In Europe the dynamic <b>olfactometry</b> method was standardized in 2003 by EN 13725 and was proposed for the measurement of odour emissions.

40|$|The {{concentration}} of sewage at wastewater treatment sites, {{as well as}} the retention and treatment thereof, in facultative and maturation ponds leads to the emission of odorants. Although odour emissions from wastewater sources do not generally cause direct health-related problems, a preliminary study of the existing literature has found that, because odour elicits a physiological response it can cause psychological stress. Furthermore, current legislation defines odours that adversely affect the amenity of an area as environmental nuisance. There is currently a buffer zone around each of the major wastewater treatment sites in the Darwin region. These buffer zones exist to limit development adjacent to wastewater infrastructure sites to reduce the likelihood of odour complaints. Due to the number, and distribution, of recent complaints from residents living near wastewater treatment sites, but outside the buffer zone, it is unclear whether, or not, the extent of current buffer zones is sufficient to minimise the exposure of the surrounding community to odour. The purpose of this thesis is to determine the suitability of current odour buffer zones surrounding wastewater infrastructure in the Darwin region. A combination of three different odour assessment techniques will be used to achieve this. These techniques are: odour dispersion modelling, field <b>olfactometry,</b> and odour complaint mapping. Odour dispersion modelling involved entering meteorological, emission, and terrain data for each site into an odour dispersion model. This was done to develop a probabilistic odour impact assessment of odorants emanating from a defined source. Field <b>olfactometry</b> was undertaken to ground-truth the dispersion model while gaining an empirical understanding of how odour from wastewater treatment sites is affecting the surrounding residents (and generating complaints).

It was initially used to help to select appropriate testing locations for field <b>olfactometry</b> by examining clusters of complaints...|$|E

Air samples were evaluated by an 8 -member sensory panel and dynamic <b>olfactometry.</b> Season, temperature, relative humidity, manure depth, pig density, air cleanliness, barn cleanliness, test fan size, test fan location (barn or pit level), pig health, pit type, and panelist were found to be important determinants of odor emission rates. Thus, while management options can be used to reduce odor emitted by swine buildings, uncontrollable variables are also significant influences. Air inlet odor concentration measured by <b>olfactometry</b> was found to be dependent on farm and panelist...|$|E
