40|$|China has {{experienced}} the rapid socioeconomic change {{that leads to}} the evolution of social and physical environment in urban neighborhoods. In recently built neighborhoods, residents lack mutual trust and a sense of community; the neighborhood <b>open</b> <b>spaces</b> have been improved but still do not function well for developing resident social capital. Social capital is a comprehensive concept for evaluating community development. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate residents?? social capital in China??s urban context and to examine the relationships between social capital and neighborhood <b>open</b> <b>spaces.</b> The review of literature identified five interpersonal factors of social capital: social network, trust, security and safety, belongingness, and engagement, which were related to neighborhood physical environment. In the city of Guangzhou, two neighborhoods were selected as study fields and two hundred and fifty subjects were randomly selected in each neighborhood to participate in a questionnaire survey. More than 75 % subjects returned questionnaires. Ten residents of them then participated in semi-structured interviews. Observation recorded residents?? activities in <b>open</b> <b>spaces.</b> Data were analyzed by statistical methods and domain analysis strategy. The results of statistical examinations demonstrated that residents living with a large number of neighborhood <b>open</b> <b>spaces</b> had higher degrees of social capital than residents lacking open spaces; residents using <b>open</b> <b>spaces</b> frequently developed higher degrees of social capital than residents using <b>open</b> <b>spaces</b> less; residents who were satisfied with their <b>open</b> <b>spaces</b> held higher degrees of social capital than those who were not satisfied with <b>open</b> <b>spaces.</b> Semi-structured interviews explained that well-designed <b>open</b> <b>spaces</b> attracted inhabitants to participate in outdoor activities, which encouraged social interaction among residents, enhanced their mutual trust, expanded social network, and strengthened belongingness to neighborhood. However, <b>open</b> <b>spaces</b> were found not to obviously improve resident engagement.

40|$|As the {{population}} of the earth expands the natural world shrinks in order to give space to our growing population. This is a problem since humans have a big part in the destruction of natural habitats. In Gretel Ehrlich’s The Solace of <b>Open</b> <b>Spaces</b> we find a close interaction between human culture and nature. The Solace of <b>Open</b> <b>Spaces</b> can be categorized as creative non fiction, and with this is mind I intend to employ a theoretical approach called ecocriticism when analyzing The Solace of <b>Open</b> <b>Spaces.</b> The following essay will examine how the narrator of The Solace of <b>Open</b> <b>Spaces</b> has depicted the relation between nature and culture. The study will be conducted by a close reading of The Solace of <b>Open</b> <b>Spaces.</b> Other than the close reading a series of important articles and websites have been consulted for further information regarding certain keywords and concepts. Important keywords which are found throughout the essay are: anthropocentrism, cowboy, culture, dualism, nature and sheepherder. My initial theory is that even though it might not be intended, a nature and culture dualism is present in The Solace of <b>Open</b> <b>Spaces.</b> I base the assumption on my belief that all humans objectify nature and see nature as a possession. The aim of the essay is to establish whether there is a nature and culture dualism present in The Solace of <b>Open</b> <b>Spaces...</b>|$|R
