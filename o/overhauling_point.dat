They refrained from advocating a complete <b>overhaul,</b> <b>pointing</b> out that a system whereby the individual taxpayer would {{make a contribution to}} the religious group of his choice, might violate the Constitution and the prevailing privacy laws. Also on November 7, 2006, Cardinal Godfried Danneels, head of the Belgian Catholic Church, publicly acknowledged that the financing system in place discriminated in favor of the Catholic Church, adding that he would not resist the change.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. This thesis examines {{the nature of}} the repairable part demand-carcass return relationship at the Navy Ships' Parts Control Center and proposes an alternate forecasting method for predicting the number of carcasses arriving at the Depot <b>Overhaul</b> <b>Points</b> in the coming quarter. The analysis begins with graphical and correlation review of the variables and then uses regression, and exponential smoothing to model carcass returns. These methods are compared to the model currently in use by an analysis of the forecasts errors. The comparison suggests that the exponential smoothing model results in the most accurate forecasts. The thesis concludes with some recommendations for model implementation. Lieutenant Commander, United States Nav...|$|R

40|$|Predictive {{maintenance}} {{needs to}} forecast {{the numbers of}} rejections at any <b>overhaul</b> <b>point</b> before any failure occurs in order to accurately and proactively take adequate maintenance action. In healthcare, prediction {{has been applied to}} foretell when and how to administer medication to improve the health condition of the patient. The same is true for maintenance where the application of prognostics can help make better decisions. In this paper, an overview of prognostic maintenance strategies is presented. The proposed data-driven prognostics approach employs a statistical technique of (i) the parameter estimation methods of the time-to-failure data to predict the relevant statistical model parameters and (ii) prognostics modelling incorporating the reliability Weibull Cumulative Distribution Function to predict part rejection, replacement, and reuse. The analysis of the modelling uses synthetic data validated by industry domain experts. The outcome of the prediction can further proffer solution to designers, manufacturers and operators of industrial product-service systems. The novelty in this paper is the development of the through-life performance approach. The approach ascertains when the system needs to undergo maintenance, repair and overhaul before failure occurs...|$|R

By the end of the calendar year Liverpool were mid table in the league and looked {{to be out of the}} running for title honours, especially as they had just lost to Manchester City 3–1 at Anfield in the Boxing Day fixture – a defeat which put John Bond's team top of the league. The New Year brought a new momentum as Bob Paisley began to get the best out of his players; they began the year in South Wales visiting the Vetch Field to play Swansea City in the FA Cup, Liverpool were in fine form and thumped their hosts 4–0. This set them on their way in the league and dropped just seven of the 50 available <b>points</b> <b>overhauling</b> the <b>points</b> gap that Ipswich Town had opened on them.|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{forecasting}} {{of repair}} turn-around time (RTAT) of United States Navy depot level repairable items {{is critical to}} achieving optimal service levels while minimizing procurement and repair costs. The Navy's Inventory Control Point has developed a forecast model that uses sophisticated Statistical Process Control techniques and non-parametric algorithms to forecast RTAT. This thesis attempts to validate the Navy's RTAT forecast model by comparing its performance to those of simple time series forecasting methods. It {{was found that the}} assumptions implicit in the UICP RTAT forecast model {{have a significant impact on}} forecast accuracy. In addition to documenting these model properties, a goal of this thesis is to identify variables that the UICP model does not use in RTAT forecasting which may improve its accuracy. The research focuses on data for repairable items that have high dollar value and the greatest number of repair transactions per quarter. Results show that the Navy's model is not consistently more accurate than any of the alternative techniques examined, and that it tends to ignore many large RTAT observations, causing it to under-forecast RTAT. Thesis research also reveals that accounting for differences in disparate designated <b>overhaul</b> <b>points</b> may significantly improve the prediction of RTAT. Finally it is shown that additional variables, derived from a NAVICP Philadelphia database and designed to capture the queueing aspect of the repair process, may significantly improve the prediction of RTAT. These findings point to the use of queueing information to obtain more accurate RTAT forecasts. U. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|R

Evans clinched both championship titles at Manfield after his closest rival at the time, Scott Pye elected not to attend the final meeting of the season at Taupo due to testing commitments in Europe.

50|$|Having not {{acquired}} {{the budget for}} a GP2 campaign, van der Zande moved into the British Formula 3 Championship, competing for Hitech Racing. On his debut, he won the first race at Silverstone. He returned to the Euroseries midway through the season, as Atte Mustonen had {{to pull out of}} the Oschersleben rounds due to health problems. He returned in Barcelona, again replacing Mustonen at Motopark. This was due to the fact that Daniel Ricciardo had sealed the 2009 British F3 title, before the final round. Hitech team-mate Walter Grubmüller <b>overhauled</b> his <b>points</b> tally, and finished as runner-up in the title race. After scoring a point in the first race in Barcelona, van der Zande won the second race from pole position.|$|R

50|$|Immediately {{after the}} race Senna was disqualified by race {{stewards}} for missing the chicane following his collision with Prost, with Senna believing that the decision {{had been made by}} FISA President Jean-Marie Balestre to give the championship to his fellow countryman Prost (the race stewards and Balestre both denied this was the case, stating that the FISA boss wasn't even present at the stewards meeting when the decision to disqualify Senna was made). Nannini was awarded the victory and he, Patrese and Boutsen took the podium ceremony. This would prove to be Alessandro Nannini's only victory in a Formula One career that was cut short by a helicopter crash almost exactly a year later which severed his right forearm. Senna's disqualification also meant that it was mathematically impossible for him to <b>overhaul</b> Prost's <b>points</b> total, and so the 1989 Championship went to the Frenchman.|$|R

Arsenal won their first game against Anderlecht by the same scoreline, with a goal from young midfielder Henri Lansbury deciding the match. Southampton scored their first goal of the 2012 pre-season in their final match against Arsenal, when new signing Jay Rodriguez converted a Danny Fox cross in the 31st minute, although the lead proved short-lived when Gervinho equalised a few minutes later, causing the game to end in a tie. Despite winning the subsequent penalty shoot-out, the Saints could not <b>overhaul</b> the <b>points</b> lead of their opponents and it was Arsenal who won the second Memorial Cup and joined Athletic Bilbao on the honours list.|$|R

5|$|The rivalry {{reached its}} peak {{at the end of}} 1989, when the title was to be decided between Senna and Prost at Suzuka.

Senna {{went on to win the}} race, but was later disqualified in a highly controversial ruling over his path back to the track, as his car was pushed through the road around the chicane. After an unsuccessful appeal by McLaren, the Brazilian received a further US$100,000 fine and a six-month suspension, leading Senna to accuse FIA president Jean-Marie Balestre of favoring his compatriot Prost. Senna's disqualification meant that it was mathematically impossible for him to <b>overhaul</b> Prost's <b>points</b> total, and so the 1989 Championship went to the Frenchman.
