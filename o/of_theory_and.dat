5|$|With Craig Kundrot, Richards {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} high pressure (1000 atmospheres) on protein structure, using hen-egg lysozyme crystals, finding that the structure was robust to such pressures apart from a quite modest compaction in size. In the 1990s, Richards and collaborators used a combination <b>of</b> <b>theory</b> <b>and</b> experiment to investigate how the well-packed interior of proteins can nevertheless accommodate mutations.|$|E
5|$|Byard {{began playing}} professionally on piano {{at the age}} of 16, in bands led by Doc Kentross and Freddy Bates. His early lessons had {{involved}} mostly playing by rote, so his development of knowledge <b>of</b> <b>theory</b> <b>and</b> further piano technique occurred from the late 1930s until 1941, including studying harmony at Commerce High School. In that year he was drafted into the army, where he continued with piano lessons and was influenced by pianist Ernie Washington, with whom he was barracked, although Byard also took up trombone at this time. He also studied Stravinsky and Chopin, and continued studying classical composers into the 1960s. Part of his military service was in Florida, where he was a mentor to the young saxophonist Cannonball Adderley and his brother, Nat. After leaving the army in 1946, Byard's musical education continued, through discussions with others, and using library materials combined with music school syllabuses.|$|E

25|$|Vocational schools offer {{a higher}} {{concentration}} of technical and vocational subjects {{in addition to}} the core academic subjects studied by students at general high schools. These schools tend to offer technical and vocational instruction in one of five main fields: agriculture, fisheries, trade-technical, home industry, and ‘non-traditional’ courses while offering a host of specializations. During the first two years, students study a general vocational area, from the five main fields mentioned. During the third and fourth years they specialize in a discipline or vocation within that area. Programs contain a mixture <b>of</b> <b>theory</b> <b>and</b> practice.|$|E
