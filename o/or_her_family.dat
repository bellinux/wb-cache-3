5|$|Henrietta Lacks (born Loretta Pleasant; August 1, 1920 – October 4, 1951) was an African American {{woman whose}} cancer cells {{are the source}} of the HeLa cell line, the first immortalized cell line {{and one of the most}} {{important}} cell lines in medical research. An immortalized cell line will reproduce indefinitely under specific conditions, and the HeLa cell line continues to be a source of invaluable medical data to the present day. As was then the practice, no consent was obtained to culture her cells, nor were she <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>family</b> compensated for their extraction or use.|$|E
5|$|For the actress, having Chloe {{become part}} of the meteor {{infected}} community in season six allowed Mack's character to continue to evolve. Mack views this transition as a means for her character to become more emotionally connected to those people—the meteor infected—she spent five seasons trying to expose to the public. Being infected by the meteors gives Chloe motivation to try to understand them and allows her to grow closer to Clark, as she can better understand {{what it feels like to}} live in a world where you have a special ability. Writer Holly Harold believes that, in addition to being infected by the meteor rocks, bringing Lois into the journalistic field also provides Chloe with a lot of ammunition for growth and development. Lois's presence at the Daily Planet allows Chloe the chance to reflect upon herself, and discover what things are most important to her – her career <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>family</b> and friends. The competition that Lois provides is beneficial, as it gives Chloe a chance to bring out the best in herself.|$|E
25|$|Bobbio Abbey {{was founded}} in 613 by the Irish missionary Saint Columbanus in 613, with land and funds from Theodelinda. The Bobbio ampullae were {{discovered}} in the 1920s in the crypt of the abbey church, and are presumed to have been given by Theodelinda <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>family.</b>|$|E

50|$|International {{marriages are}} subject to {{separate}} rules within Japan. Foreigners in Japan do not have their own family registration sheet, and therefore those who marry a Japanese national are listed on his <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>family's</b> sheet. Foreign spouses in Japan are eligible for a long-term dependent visa.|$|R
50|$|For skaters {{from the}} United States and Canada, {{it is more}} typical to see a skater look back to his <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>family's</b> country of origin. In {{previous}} years, this meant looking back towards Europe, but, more and more, skaters from the United States are looking south towards Puerto Rico and Mexico for countries to represent.|$|R
25|$|It is {{generally}} held that every Jew {{is bound to}} observe the mitzvot (commandments of Judaism) by following the customs appropriate to his <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>family</b> origin: see Minhag. For this reason a number of rabbis disapprove of the adoption of Nusach Sefard by Ashkenazi Jews.|$|E
25|$|The monarchy {{comprises}} the reigning monarch, his <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>family,</b> and the royal household organization which supports and facilitates the monarch {{in the exercise}} of his duties and prerogatives.

25|$|India has {{legislation}} since 1986 {{which allows}} work by children in non-hazardous industry. In 2013, the Punjab and Haryana High Court gave a landmark order that directed that there shall {{be a total}} ban on the employment of children up {{to the age of}} 14 years, be it hazardous or non-hazardous industries. However, the Court ruled that a child can work with his <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>family</b> in family based trades/occupations, for the purpose of learning a new trade/craftsmanship or vocation.|$|E
5000|$|... “In other words, Kuo’s {{conviction}} was upheld with inconsistent {{testimony and}} without any substantial evidence because no cash was never found — not in the tea box nor in any of Kuo’s <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>family’s</b> bank accounts,” Koo said. “I’m wondering if the judicial system applies {{a different set of}} standard for DPP politicians and government officials who served under the DPP administration.|$|R
5000|$|In both cum manu and sine manu {{marriage}}s, if {{both the}} husband and wife were alieni iuris (persons under patria potestas, that is, under the power of his <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>family's</b> pater familias) the marriage could only take place with the approval of both of the patres familias. However, the creation and termination of the marriage somewhat depended on the type of marriage.|$|R

25|$|However, {{in spite}} of the enthusiasm for EBP over the last decade or two, some authors have redefined EBP in ways that contradict, or at least add other factors to, the {{original}} emphasis on empirical research foundations. For example, EBP may be defined as treatment choices based not only on outcome research but also on practice wisdom (the experience of the clinician) and on family values (the preferences and assumptions of a client and his <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>family</b> or subculture).|$|E
25|$|Given the benign {{nature of}} the {{condition}} and the low seizure frequency, treatment is often unnecessary. If treatment is warranted or preferred by the child and his <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>family,</b> antiepileptic drugs can usually control the seizures easily. Carbamazepine is {{the most frequently used}} first-line drug, but many other antiepileptic drugs, including valproate, phenytoin, gabapentin, levetiracetam and sultiame have been found effective as well. Bedtime dosing is advised by some. Treatment can be short and drugs can almost certainly be discontinued after two years without seizures and with normal EEG findings, perhaps even earlier.|$|E
25|$|Images of {{the reigning}} monarch and his <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>family</b> have also {{traditionally}} been printed on Canadian postage stamps since 1851, when Queen Victoria and her consort, Prince Albert, were shown on 12- and 6-pence stamps, respectively, for mail in the Province of Canada. Stamps previously issued in other British North American colonies showed images of crowns and, {{into the late}} 1800s, bore some variation of the Queen's cypher. Starting in 1939, {{when she was still}} Princess Elizabeth of York, Queen Elizabeth II has been depicted in 59 successive stamp designs in Canada, continuing on to the Queen Elizabeth II definitive stamps released in the 2000s.|$|E
25|$|During a {{greeting}} ritual, {{the person who}} has entered the contact answers a series of questions about his <b>or</b> <b>her</b> whole <b>family,</b> from the person who was already there. The answer is sewa, which means that everything is fine. Then the Dogon who has entered the contact repeats the ritual, asking the resident how his <b>or</b> <b>her</b> whole <b>family</b> is. Because the word sewa is so commonly repeated throughout a Dogon village, neighboring peoples have dubbed the Dogon the sewa people.|$|R

25|$|To {{discourage}} Poles {{from giving}} shelter to Jews, the Germans often searched houses and introduced ruthless penalties. Poland {{was the only}} occupied country during World War II where the Nazis formally imposed {{the death penalty for}} anybody found sheltering and helping Jews. The penalty applied not only to the person who did the helping, but also extended to his <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>family,</b> neighbors and sometimes to entire villages. In this way Germans applied the principle of collective responsibility whose purpose was to encourage neighbors to inform on each other in order to avoid punishment. The nature of these policies was widely known and visibly publicized by the Nazis who sought to terrorize the Polish population.|$|E
25|$|The {{collapse}} of the Marxist-Leninist government in the country had a significant influence on the average Russian's economic ability to maintain his <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>family.</b> Because of the large population of bears in Russia and an increasing demand for bear parts, especially bile, poaching of bears became increasingly popular. Its main trade partners in bear parts are primarily nearby Asian countries like South Korea and the People's Republic of China. Poaching of the snow leopard is also a serious problem in Russia along with Afghanistan, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, People’s Republic of China, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The situation for antelopes has deteriorated significantly since the {{collapse of}} the Soviet system. There has been increase in poaching of the saiga antelope which reduced the saiga population in the country.|$|E
25|$|A {{marriage}} of pleasure, {{where a man}} pays a sum of money to a woman <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>family</b> {{in exchange for a}} temporary spousal relationship, is found and considered legal among Shia sect of Islam, for example in Iran after 1979. Temporary marriages are forbidden among Sunni sect of Islam. Among Shia, the number of temporary marriages can be unlimited, for a duration that is less than an hour to few months, recognized with an official temporary marriage certificate, and divorce is unnecessary because the temporary marriage automatically expires on the date and time specified on the certificate. Payment to the woman by the man is mandatory, in every temporary marriage and considered as mahr. Its practitioners cite sharia law as permitting the practise. Women's rights groups have condemned it as a form of legalized prostitution.|$|E

Other royals have participated in Australian ceremonies or undertaken duties abroad, such as Prince Charles at the Anzac Day ceremonies at Gallipoli, or when the Queen, Prince Charles, and Princess Anne participated in Australian ceremonies for the anniversary of D-Day in France in 2004. On 22 February 2009, Princess Anne represented the Queen at the National Bushfires Memorial Service in Melbourne.

500|$|Andrianampoinimerina {{developed}} a legal system that applied throughout the territories he ruled. [...] He {{was the first}} Merina king to establish formal civil and penal codes, the latter ameliorated and transcribed by his son Radama. He declared twelve crimes to be capital offenses, while many others entailed collective punishment for the guilty party and his <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>family</b> members including forced labor in chains and being reduced to slave status. These harsh penalties were intended {{to act as a}} strong disincentive to engage in antisocial acts; the consumption of alcohol, marijuana and tobacco were also outlawed, although they remained prevalent. To judge infractions of his laws, the king often relied on the tradition of tangena, whereby surviving the ingestion of poison indicated an accused person's innocence.|$|E

500|$|In Traveling Shoes, Angelou {{has matured}} {{as a writer}} {{to the point that}} she can {{experiment}} with form. [...] For the first time, instead of using traditional numbered chapters, the book consists of anecdotes separated with a few inches of white space. [...] Lupton calls these segments [...] "short stories or vignettes", a technique that Angelou had used before, to portray dynamic characters such as Malcolm X. [...] Angelou's stories are told within the context of her entire life story, but each vignette can be read or analyzed individually, without harming the text's consistency. [...] Most of Angelou's anecdotes no longer focus on the famous <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>family,</b> but on Ghanaians; for example, according to Lupton, her description of her houseboy Kojo is her most delightful character sketch in the book.|$|E
