5|$|A {{wildfire}} or {{wildland fire}} is {{a fire in}} an area of combustible vegetation that occurs in the countryside or rural area. Depending on the type of vegetation where it occurs, a wildfire can also be classified more specifically as a brush fire, bush fire, desert fire, forest fire, grass fire, hill fire, peat fire, vegetation fire, or veld fire. Fossil charcoal indicates that wildfires began soon after the appearance <b>of</b> <b>terrestrial</b> plants 420 million years ago. Wildfire’s occurrence throughout the history <b>of</b> <b>terrestrial</b> life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems' flora and fauna.|$|E

5|$|While high {{metallicity}} {{is beneficial}} {{for the creation}} <b>of</b> <b>terrestrial</b> extrasolar planets, an excess amount can be harmful for life. Excess metallicity {{may lead to the}} formation {{of a large number of}} gas giants in a given system, which may subsequently migrate from beyond the system's frost line and become hot Jupiters, disturbing planets that would otherwise have been located in the system's circumstellar habitable zone. Thus, it was found that the Goldilocks principle applies to metallicity as well; low-metallicity systems have low probabilities of forming terrestrial-mass planets at all, while excessive metallicities cause a large number of gas giants to develop, disrupting the orbital dynamics of the system and altering the habitability <b>of</b> <b>terrestrial</b> planets in the system.|$|E
5|$|All baleen {{whales are}} carnivorous; however a 2015 study {{revealed}} they house gut flora {{similar to that}} <b>of</b> <b>terrestrial</b> herbivores. Different kinds of prey are found in different abundances depending on location, and each type of whale is adapted to a specialized way of foraging. There {{are two types of}} feeding behaviors: skim-feeding and lunge-feeding, but some species do both depending on the type and amount of food. For example, Antarctic whales mostly feed on euphausiids; however, this is mainly effective for lunge-feeders, whereas skim-feeders, like the right whales, feed primarily on copepods. They feed alone or in small groups. Baleen whales get the water they need from their food, and their kidneys excrete excess salt.|$|E
5|$|Although 47 Ursae Majoris b {{is outside}} its star's {{habitable}} zone, its gravitational influence would disrupt {{the orbit of}} planets in the outer part of the habitable zone. In addition, it may have disrupted the formation <b>of</b> <b>terrestrial</b> planets and reduced the delivery of water to any inner planets in the system. Therefore, planets located in the habitable zone of 47 Ursae Majoris {{are likely to be}} small and dry.|$|E

5|$|Ants {{are found}} on all continents except Antarctica, {{and only a}} few large islands, such as Greenland, Iceland, parts of Polynesia and the Hawaiian Islands lack native ant species. Ants occupy a wide range of {{ecological}} niches and exploit many different food resources as direct or indirect herbivores, predators and scavengers. Most ant species are omnivorous generalists, but a few are specialist feeders. Their ecological dominance is demonstrated by their biomass: ants are estimated to contribute 15–20% (on average and nearly 25% in the tropics) <b>of</b> <b>terrestrial</b> animal biomass, exceeding that of the vertebrates.|$|E
5|$|In the Canadian {{portion of}} the Columbia Basin, almost half of {{which is part of}} the Kootenay River basin, there are 447 species <b>of</b> <b>terrestrial</b> vertebrates. Most of the Kootenay basin lies within the Columbia Glaciated {{ecoregion}} which encompasses much of northeastern Washington, northern Idaho, northwestern Montana and southern British Columbia. Fish fauna in the region are largely shared with those of the Columbia Unglaciated ecoregion to the south, which has about fifty species of fish and only one endemic species. There are no endemic fish within the Columbia Glaciated region itself.|$|E
5|$|It {{is largely}} unknown how baleen whales produce sound {{because of the}} lack of a melon and vocal cords. In a 2007 study, it was {{discovered}} that the larynx had U-shaped folds which are thought to be similar to vocal cords. They are positioned parallel to air flow, as opposed to the perpendicular vocal cords <b>of</b> <b>terrestrial</b> mammals. These may control air flow and cause vibrations. The walls of the larynx are able to contract which may generate sound with support from the arytenoid cartilages. The muscles surrounding the larynx may expel air rapidly or maintain a constant volume while diving.|$|E

5|$|Lactation {{proceeds}} for 19 to 42 months, but calves, rarely, may suckle up to 13 years. Like other whales, {{the sperm}} whale's milk {{has a higher}} fat content than that <b>of</b> <b>terrestrial</b> mammals: about 36%, compared to 4% in cow milk. This gives it a consistency similar to cottage cheese, which prevents it from dissolving in the water before the calf can eat it. It has an energy content of roughly 3,840 kcal/kg, compared to just 640 kcal/kg in cow milk. Calves may be allowed to suckle from females other than their mothers.|$|E
5|$|Many {{plants have}} {{external}} structural defenses that discourage herbivory. Depending on the herbivore’s physical characteristics (i.e. size and defensive armor), plant structural defenses on stems and leaves can deter, injure, or kill the grazer. Some defensive compounds are produced internally but are released onto the plant’s surface; for example, resins, lignins, silica, and wax cover the epidermis <b>of</b> <b>terrestrial</b> plants and alter {{the texture of}} the plant tissue. The leaves of holly plants, for instance, are very smooth and slippery making feeding difficult. Some plants produce gummosis or sap that traps insects.|$|E
5|$|Newly {{discovered}} planets, particularly {{ones that}} are potentially habitable, have enabled SETI and METI programs to refocus projects for communication with extraterrestrial intelligence. In 2009 A Message From Earth (AMFE) was sent toward the Gliese 581 planetary system, which contains two potentially habitable planets, the confirmed Gliese 581d and the more habitable but unconfirmed Gliese 581g. In the SETILive project, which began in 2012, human volunteers analyze data from the Allen Telescope Array to search for possible alien signals that computers might miss because <b>of</b> <b>terrestrial</b> radio interference. The data for the study is obtained by observing Kepler target stars with the radio telescope.|$|E
