40|$|Interference of {{multimode}} photon echoes {{generated in}} spatially separated solid-state atomic ensembles STAUDT, M <b>U.,</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> High-visibility interference of photon echoes generated in spatially separated solid-state atomic ensembles is demonstrated. The solid-state ensembles were LiNbO(3) waveguides doped with erbium ions absorbing at 1. 53 microm. Bright coherent states {{of light in}} several temporal modes (up to 3) are stored and retrieved from the optical memories using two-pulse photon echoes. The stored and retrieved optical pulses, when combined at a beam splitter, show almost perfect interference, which demonstrates both phase preserving storage and indistinguishability of photon echoes from separate optical memories. By measuring interference fringes for different storage times, we also show explicitly that the visibility is not limited by atomic decoherence. These results are relevant for novel quantum-repeater architectures with photon-echo based multimode quantum memories.

30|$|Based on the {{physical}} properties obtained from SED fitting, we computed the Specific Star Formation Rates (SSFR [yr−]; defined as the ratio of SFR and stellar mass) for the ADF-S sample. The SSFR rate is commonly used to analyse star formation history. For ULIRGs, LIRGs, {{and the rest of}} our sample, the logarithmic values of the SSFR parameter are equal to − 9.00 ± 0.55, − 9.68 ± 0.59, and − 10.28 ± 0.57, respectively. Howell <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (2010), and <b>U</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (2012) presented the mean and median values of the SSFR for (U)LIRGs sample, without an additional separation. The median value of SSFR for galaxies in the GOALS field (Howell <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2010) is equal to − 9.41 [yr− 1], while <b>U</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (2012) obtained the value of − 9.17 [yr− 1]. The same parameter computed for LIRGs and ULIRGs together in our ADF-S sample is equal to − 9.51 [yr−]. We conclude that our results are consistent with the results mentioned in all the other works considered for comparison.|$|R

Even though our result shows the highest value of logMstar, it is still consistent with the values listed above within the error bars. Stellar masses for the ULIRG sample have a mean logMstar equal to 11.43 ± 0.31 [M⊙]. The mean stellar masses for 11 ULIRGs presented by <b>U</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (2012) were calculated as logMstar = 11.00 ± 0.40 [M⊙].

40|$|The eddy {{covariance}} (EC) {{technique is}} a standard reference for estimating carbon and water vapor exchanges in regional and local flux networks (Baldocchi, 2003). Eddy covariance uses high frequency measurements of scalars (water vapor, temperature, etc.) and the vertical component of wind speed to determine fluxes. The method requires sonic anemometers and hygrometers or gas analyzers (Kaimal, Finnigan, 1994; Shaw, Snyder, 2003). The surface renewal (SR) method for estimating fluxes from canopies involves high frequency measurements of scalar variables. The high frequency data are analyzed for ramp-like characteristics and the amplitude and inverse ramp frequency are used in basic energy or mass conservation equations to estimate fluxes. In previous papers, good results were reported for estimating sensible heat flux (H) over a variety of vegetated surfaces (Paw <b>U</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 1995; Snyder <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 1996; Spano <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 1997 a, 1997 b; Anandakumar, 1999; Spano <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2002). Little information, however, is available on using SR to estimate latent (LE) and CO 2 flux (Fc) density (Paw <b>U</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 1995; Spano <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2002; Spano <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2004). The advantage in using the SR rather than the EC method is that, after calibration, a sonic anemometer is not required. The aim of this worth was the assessment of energy and mass exchanges between grapevine canopy surface and the atmosphere using the EC and SR methods...|$|R
