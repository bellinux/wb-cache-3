5|$|Farther north, work on {{the segment}} between Brown and Allen Streets was {{performed}} on one side at a time, keeping one side <b>of</b> <b>Broad</b> Street open at all times. The northbound lanes of this segment were closed on April7, and one direction of the segment was closed until November. It fully reopened on December3 along with the West Main Street–Allen Street segment. Rehabilitation <b>of</b> <b>Broad</b> Street from West Main Street to Exchange Boulevard {{was expected to be}} completed in mid-to-late 2011. The entire project, which also calls for landscape improvements to the area surrounding West Broad Street, was tentatively scheduled to be finished in February 2012.|$|E

5|$|During the 1890s, Harvard Law School was {{pioneering}} the casebook {{method of}} teaching introduced by Dean Christopher Langdell. Apart from Langdell, Hand's professors included Samuel Williston, John Chipman Gray, and James Barr Ames. Hand preferred those teachers who valued {{common sense and}} fairness, and ventured beyond casebook study into the philosophy of law. His favorite professor was James Bradley Thayer, who taught him evidence {{in his second year}} and constitutional law in his third. A man <b>of</b> <b>broad</b> interests, Thayer became a major influence on Hand's jurisprudence. He emphasized the law's historical and human dimensions rather than its certainties and extremes. He stressed the need for courts to exercise judicial restraint in deciding social issues.|$|E
5|$|Fort Eliza, {{also known}} as The Salt Battery, is a {{freestanding}} five-sided four-gun battery, constructed around 1812, and standing {{on the east side}} of the River Shannon. Three sides face the river and were formed <b>of</b> <b>broad</b> parapets. The other two sides meet at the rear salient angle at a guardhouse, which is now ruined. The battery is surrounded by a dry moat, with the entrance originally across a drawbridge close to the guardhouse. At the centre of the enclosure was the brick-vaulted powder magazine. This fort, combined with Cromwell's Castle, the Martello tower and Fort Falkland would have protected both the town and the river crossing from all angles.|$|E

5|$|In February 2010, {{work began}} on a $17.5million project to either {{demolish}} or rehabilitate the Broad Street bridge between Brown Street and Exchange Boulevard (NY383). As {{part of the}} project, {{the section of the}} bridge between Brown and West Main Streets would be removed—allowing for the canal bed to be filled in and the road to be rebuilt—while the segment between West Main Street and Exchange Boulevard would be rehabilitated. The portion <b>of</b> <b>Broad</b> Street between Allen and Main Streets was closed to all traffic in February and was originally scheduled to open on October30. It finally reopened to traffic on December3.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of the 20th century, the North London Line {{suffered}} a reduction in passengers and, especially, revenue, owing to the expansion of the bus, tram and Underground networks. In 1909, the NLR passed general handing of trains to the LNWR. By 1913, numbers had dropped to 44.6 per cent compared to 1900, and by 1921 to only 23.3 percent and the patronage <b>of</b> <b>Broad</b> Street station declined accordingly. On 8 September 1915, the station was damaged by a Zeppelin attack.|$|E
5|$|The Allied navies of France and Italy {{essentially}} followed Admiralty camouflage practice. In 1913, American camouflage experiments included a submarine painted in a three-color pattern <b>of</b> <b>broad</b> vertical stripes designed by William Mackay, using white stripes to separate {{green and blue}} stripes. Wilkinson visited the United States to advise the U.S. Navy on ship camouflage. Dazzle schemes were used on merchant ships, naval transports, and smaller warships.

5|$|The {{courtyard}} façade of {{the main}} wing, in the same classical style as its counterpart facing the Ill, is narrower. A strong emphasis is put on the verticality of the windows, by which means the impression of height is accentuated. Again, a central avant-corps is crowned with a triangular pediment bearing reliefs {{and in this case}} also statues. Both façades are richly decorated with allegorical mascarons (depicting seasons, temperaments, continents and elements), eighteen in all on the riverside façade and nine in all on the courtyard façade, to which the riverside façade adds a pair <b>of</b> <b>broad</b> wrought-iron balconies. Due to the difference in width and the trapezoidal plan, the centres of the façades are not aligned.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{designed}} to be the most humorous of Torchwoods second series and incorporated elements <b>of</b> <b>broad</b> comedy and soap opera style storytelling to the monster of the week story. It was filmed largely on location in South Wales—prominent locations included the tourist attractions Margam Country Park and Dyffryn Gardens—and featured an ensemble of previously unseen Welsh characters. The episode was seen by an aggregated total of 4.76 million viewers across its three debut showings in the United Kingdom. Critical response was extremely mixed, with some reviewers praising the inclusion of a less serious episode and others expressing the view that the comedy was too overt.|$|E
5|$|The {{most natural}} and {{convenient}} {{way to express}} the relation involves the algebraic concept of exact sequences: sequences of objects (in this case groups) and morphisms (in this case group homomorphisms) between them such {{that the image of}} one morphism equals the kernel of the next. In general, this does not allow (co)homology groups of a space to be completely computed. However, because many important spaces encountered in topology are topological manifolds, simplicial complexes, or CW complexes, which are constructed by piecing together very simple patches, a theorem such as that of Mayer and Vietoris is potentially <b>of</b> <b>broad</b> and deep applicability.|$|E

5|$|The {{station was}} opened as Westminster Bridge on 24 December 1868 by the steam-operated District Railway (DR) (now the District line) when the railway opened {{the first section}} of its line from South Kensington. It was {{originally}} the eastern terminus of the DR and the station cutting ended at a concrete wall buffered by timber sleepers. The approach to the station from the west runs in cut and cover tunnel under the roadway <b>of</b> <b>Broad</b> Sanctuary and diagonally under Parliament Square. In Broad Sanctuary the tunnel is close to Westminster Abbey and St Margaret's church and care was required to avoid undermining their foundations when excavating in the poor ground found there.|$|E
5|$|This is {{the only}} subway station serving the island <b>of</b> <b>Broad</b> Channel, which is located in Jamaica Bay. The island only has about 3,000 residents, and as a result, this is the least-used station in the subway system not {{counting}} the closed Cortlandt Street station. However, this station serves an important role. It is the transfer point between the Rockaway Park Shuttle, which runs to Rockaway Park–Beach 116th Street, and the A train, which runs through Brooklyn and Manhattan.|$|E
5|$|When {{copulation}} takes place, {{the male}} butterfly or moth places a capsule of sperm (spermatophore) in a receptacle {{of the female}} (called the corpus bursae). The sperm, when released from the capsule, swims directly into or via a small tube into a special seminal receptacle (spermatheca), where the sperm is stored until it is released into the vagina for fertilisation during egg laying, which may occur hours, days, or months after mating. The eggs pass through the ovipore. The ovipore {{may be at the}} end of a modified ovipositor or surrounded by a pair <b>of</b> <b>broad</b> setose anal papillae.|$|E

5|$|A banqueting {{house was}} built just inside the {{south-west}} corner of the moat. Though it was probably built in the 16th century, {{it was in a}} dilapidated state by 1577. A base court (an enclosed area) was added in front of the castle’s gatehouse after the main complex was built, but it unclear when. Wetland areas south and east of the castle may have been used to emulate a mere, a type <b>of</b> <b>broad</b> shallow lake. As well as this, there were two fishponds, but their dating is uncertain. During Wressle Castle’s heyday in the 16th century, the quality of the gardens and ornamental landscape would have paralleled the interior of the renovated buildings, possibly even rivalling gardens at royal properties.|$|E
5|$|Penn sent three commissioners to {{supervise}} the settlement and to set aside 10,000 acres (40km²) for the city. The commissioners bought land from Swedes at the settlement of Wicaco, and from there began {{to lay out the}} city toward the north. The area went about a mile along the Delaware River between modern South and Vine Streets. Penn's ship anchored off the coast of New Castle, Delaware, on October 27, 1682, and he arrived in Philadelphia a few days after that. He expanded the city west to the bank of the Schuylkill River, for a total of 1,200 acres (4.8km²). Streets were laid out in a gridiron system. Except for the two widest streets, High (now Market) and Broad, the streets were named after prominent landowners who owned adjacent lots. The streets were renamed in 1684; the ones running east-west were named after local trees (Vine, Sassafras, Mulberry, Cherry, Chestnut, Walnut, Locust, Spruce, Pine, Lombard, and Cedar) and the north-south streets were numbered. Within the area, four squares (now named Rittenhouse, Logan, Washington and Franklin) were set aside as parks open for everyone. Penn designed a central square at the intersection <b>of</b> <b>Broad</b> and what is now Market Street to be surrounded by public buildings.|$|E
5|$|Spiny {{scallops}} are dioecious, individuals being either male or female. They become mature {{at about}} 2 {{years old and}} usually live for about 4 years. Breeding {{takes place in the}} summer. Gametes are released into the water column and fertilisation is external. Veliger larvae begin to develop from the eggs in about 2 days and drift with the plankton for 40 days, growing to a maximum valve length of 240μ (0.01 inch). The larvae have a tuft <b>of</b> <b>broad,</b> compound cilia near the mouth. The velum, the locomotory and feeding organ, has bands of cilia running down it. The simple eyes and rudimentary gills start developing on about the 25th day. The foot becomes visible on the 15th day and the propodium (the projecting front end of the foot) develops on about the 28th. By the 34rd day, the larva is crawling about using its foot and its cilia. Metamorphosis takes place on about the 40th day. Over the course of 48 hours, the internal organs undergo a 90° rotation, the valves, hinge and ligament appear and the gills lengthen. A swimming veliger larva has become a benthic juvenile scallop.|$|E
