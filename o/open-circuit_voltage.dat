25|$|A battery's {{capacity}} {{is the amount}} of electric charge it can deliver at the rated voltage. The more electrode material contained in the cell the greater its capacity. A small cell has less capacity than a larger cell with the same chemistry, although they develop the same <b>open-circuit</b> <b>voltage.</b> Capacity is measured in units such as amp-hour (A·h). The rated capacity of a battery is usually expressed as the product of 20 hours multiplied by the current that a new battery can consistently supply for 20 hours at , while remaining above a specified terminal voltage per cell. For example, a battery rated at 100 A·h can deliver 5 A over a 20-hour period at room temperature. The fraction of the stored charge that a battery can deliver depends on multiple factors, including battery chemistry, {{the rate at which the}} charge is delivered (current), the required terminal voltage, the storage period, ambient temperature and other factors.|$|E

2500|$|The {{electrical}} {{driving force}} or [...] across the terminals {{of a cell}} {{is known as the}} terminal voltage (difference) and is measured in volts. The terminal voltage of a cell that is neither charging nor discharging is called the <b>open-circuit</b> <b>voltage</b> and equals the emf of the cell. Because of internal resistance, the terminal voltage of a cell that is discharging is smaller in magnitude than the <b>open-circuit</b> <b>voltage</b> and the terminal voltage of a cell that is charging exceeds the <b>open-circuit</b> <b>voltage.</b> An ideal cell has negligible internal resistance, so it would maintain a constant terminal voltage of [...] until exhausted, then dropping to zero. If such a cell maintained 1.5 volts and stored a charge of one coulomb then on complete discharge it would perform 1.5 joules of work. In actual cells, the internal resistance increases under discharge and the open circuit voltage also decreases under discharge. If the voltage and resistance are plotted against time, the resulting graphs typically are a curve; the shape of the curve varies according to the chemistry and internal arrangement employed.|$|E

40|$|Several recent major {{advances}} {{in the design of}} dyes and electrolytes for dye-sensitized solar cells have led to record power-conversion efficiencies. Donor-pi-acceptor dyes absorb much more strongly than commonly employed ruthenium-based dyes, thereby allowing most of the visible spectrum to be absorbed in thinner films. Light-trapping strategies are also improving photon absorption in thin films. New cobalt-based redox couples are making it possible to obtain higher <b>open-circuit</b> <b>voltages,</b> leading to a new record power-conversion efficiency of 12. 3 %. Solid-state hole conductor materials also have the potential to increase <b>open-circuit</b> <b>voltages</b> and are making dye-sensitized solar cells more manufacturable. Engineering the interface between the titania and the hole transport material is being used to reduce recombination and thus attain higher photocurrents and <b>open-circuit</b> <b>voltages.</b> The combination of these strategies promises to provide much more efficient and stable solar cells, paving the way for large-scale commercialization. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The voltage drops modestly, {{with this type of}} cell, until the short-circuit current is approached (ISC). Maximum power (with 45°C cell temperature) is typically produced with 75% to 80% of the <b>open-circuit</b> <b>voltage</b> (0.43V in this case) and 90% of the short-circuit current.

Lower-quality cells have a more rapid drop in voltage with increasing current and could produce only 1/2VOC at 1/2ISC.

If we take 6000K for {{the temperature of the}} sun and 300K for ambient conditions on earth, this comes to 95%. In 1981, Alexis de Vos and Herman Pauwels showed that this is achievable with a stack of an infinite number of cells with band gaps ranging from infinity (the first cells encountered by the incoming photons) to zero, with a voltage in each cell very close to the <b>open-circuit</b> <b>voltage,</b> equal to 95% of the band gap of that cell, and with 6000K blackbody radiation coming from all directions. However, the 95% efficiency thereby achieved means that the electric power is 95% of the net amount of light absorbed – the stack emits radiation as it has non-zero temperature, and this radiation has to be subtracted from the incoming radiation when calculating the amount of heat being transferred and the efficiency. They also considered the more relevant problem of maximizing the power output for a stack being illuminated from all directions by 6000K blackbody radiation. In this case, the voltages must be lowered to less than 95% of the band gap (the percentage is not constant over all the cells). They found that the maximum power was 86.8% of the amount of in-coming radiation. When the in-coming radiation comes only from an area of the sky the size of the sun, the efficiency limit drops to 68.7%.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Nanomaterials such as {{semiconductor}} nanowires have unique {{features that}} could enable novel optoelectronic {{applications such as}} novel solar cells. This paper aims to demonstrate one such recently proposed concept: Monolithically Integrated Laterally Arrayed Multiple Band gap (MILAMB) solar cells for spectrum-splitting photovoltaic systems. Two cells with different band gaps were fabricated simultaneously in the same process on a single substrate using spatially composition-graded CdSSe alloy nanowires grown by the Dual-Gradient Method in a chemical vapor deposition system. CdSSe nanowire ensemble devices tested under 1 sun AM 1. 5 G illumination achieved <b>open-circuit</b> <b>voltages</b> up to 307 and 173 mV and short-circuit current densities as high as 0. 091 and 0. 974 mA/cm 2 for the CdS- and CdSe-rich cells, respectively. The <b>open-circuit</b> <b>voltages</b> were roughly three times those of similar CdSSe film cells fabricated for comparison due to the superior optical quality of the nanowires. I−V measurements were also performed using optical filters to simulate spectrum-splitting. The <b>open-circuit</b> <b>voltages</b> and fill factors of the CdS-rich subcells were uniformly larger than the corresponding CdSe-rich cells for similar photon flux, as expected. This suggests that if all wires can be contacted, the wide-gap cell {{is expected to have}} greater output power than the narrow-gap cell, which is the key to achieving high efficiencies with spectrum-splitting. This paper thus provides the first proof-of-concept demonstration of simultaneous fabrication of MILAMB solar cells. This approach to solar cell fabrication using single-crystal nanowires for spectrum-splitting photovoltaics could provide a future low-cost high-efficiency alternative to the conventional high-cost high-efficiency tandem cells...|$|R
