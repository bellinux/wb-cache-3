5|$|Homer trips over Bart's {{skateboard}} {{and falls}} down the stairs, hurting his back, and {{is confined to}} the couch for several days. Marge sends Bart to clean his room and while doing so, he discovers an old cherry bomb among his things. At school the next day, he decides to flush it down the toilet in the boys' restroom with friends, Milhouse, Richard and Lewis. On the same day, Principal Skinner's mother, Agnes, is visiting the school and Bart ends up pulling his prank the same time Agnes is using the facilities in an adjacent girls' restroom. The resulting explosion blows her off <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>seat</b> and enrages Principal Skinner. In order to punish him, Principal Skinner proposes deportation to Homer and Marge, by having Bart participate in a foreign exchange program. They decide to send Bart to France, while the Simpsons host a student from the Socialist People's Republic of Albania, named Adil Hoxha. Bart is shown {{a picture of a}} lovely château in the heart of France and he immediately agrees to go, much to Homer and Skinner's delight.|$|E
2500|$|On August 5, 2007, a {{restraining}} lap bar broke causing an unidentified 15-year-old girl {{to fall out}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>seat</b> and {{into the center of}} the ride where she was briefly knocked unconscious. [...] The ride was running in reverse at the time. [...] The victim was taken to the hospital with head and leg injuries, and complaining of neck and back pain.|$|E
2500|$|Price was not {{the first}} {{hardened}} witness [...] had faced, and certainly not the most depraved. Nor was she the first witness who tried to stare him down and, failing that, who seemed as if she were about to leap out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>seat</b> and strike him. She {{was not the}} first witness to be evasive, sarcastic and crude. She was, however, the first witness to use her bad memory, truculence, and total lack of refinement, and at times, even ignorance, to great advantage.|$|E
25|$|Mandarava {{is usually}} {{depicted}} in a standing pose, {{yet there are}} some depictions <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>seated</b> (in meditative postures), and occasional depictions of Mandarava in an energetic dance, with her right leg raised, denoting her enlightened activity and dakini nature.|$|R
50|$|Fmr. Rep. Shelley Berkley (NV-1)- Unsuccessfully ran for Senate in 2012 instead <b>of</b> {{defending}} <b>her</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Baskin was {{an active}} {{supporter}} of the bus boycott and the Civil Rights Movement. She is most famous for a photograph <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>seated</b> on a Montgomery bus in front of Martin Luther King Jr. following the desegregation of the city's buses. [...] She died in Montgomery, Alabama.|$|R
2500|$|A third passenger, a 15-year-old Chinese girl, died of her {{injuries}} at San Francisco General Hospital {{six days}} after the accident[...] She had been wearing her seatbelt and was seated in 42A which is the last row of passenger seats {{on the left side}} of the aircraft and was immediately forward of door 4L. During the crash the back <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>seat</b> rotated back and against the floor, leaving her exposed. Her injuries were likely due to being struck by door 4L which separated during the airplane’s final impact.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bring {{with you}} the limes {{you have in your}} desk," [...] was the {{unexpected}} command which arrested her before she got out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{what are}} you doing, Albe't?" [...] Mrs. Lander lamented, falling {{helpless}} against the back <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>seat.</b> [...] "Haven't I always told you {{to speak to the}} hoss fust?" ...|$|E
50|$|By virtue <b>of</b> holding <b>her</b> <b>seat</b> on city council, Duplessis {{continues}} {{to serve on}} the Plateau-Mont-Royal borough council.|$|R
60|$|In {{profound}} silence, and glaring viciously at {{the brilliant}} flower-bed, Dr. Monygham poured mental imprecations on Charles Gould's head. Behind him the immobility of Mrs. Gould {{added to the}} grace <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>seated</b> figure the charm of art, of an attitude caught and interpreted for ever. Turning abruptly, the doctor took his leave.|$|R
60|$|George on marrying {{resigned}} his commission, at {{the earnest}} entreaties of his wife, and retired to one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>seats,</b> to {{the enjoyment of}} ease and domestic love. The countess was enthusiastically attached to him; and as motives for the indulgence of coquetry were wanting, her character became gradually improved by the contemplation of the excellent qualities <b>of</b> <b>her</b> generous husband.|$|R
60|$|John {{had reached}} the back <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>seat</b> before she was at all {{sensible}} of his return, and Grace lost her self-command immediately. She rose and took a seat on a sofa, {{and the young man}} was immediately at her side.|$|E
60|$|So we waited, {{my mother}} sitting stiffly {{on the extreme}} edge <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>seat,</b> holding me tightly by the hand; I believe with some vague idea of flight, should out of that vault-scented gloom the devil {{suddenly}} appear to claim us for his own. But before the curtain was quite up she had forgotten him.|$|E
60|$|She was {{interrupted}} by the ringing of the telephone bell. She was out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>seat</b> and {{across the room at}} the receiver with what appeared to Lord Mountry's startled gaze one bound. As she put the instrument to her ear a wave of joy swept over her face. She gave a little cry of delight and excitement.|$|E
50|$|From 2001 to 2009, St-Arnaud {{served on}} the Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve borough council by virtue <b>of</b> holding <b>her</b> <b>seat</b> on city council.|$|R
50|$|Flores {{decided not}} to seek reelection to <b>her</b> Assembly <b>seat</b> for the 28th {{district}} to instead run for Lieutenant Governor <b>of</b> Nevada. <b>Her</b> <b>seat</b> was taken by Edgar Flores (no relation).|$|R
50|$|Merytre-Hatshepsut was {{of noble}} birth. She was {{possibly}} {{the daughter of}} the Adoratrix Huy, whose statue in the British Museum (EA 1280) shows Huy holding a grandchild and represents the other children of Thutmose III and Merytre-Hatshepsut along the sides <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>seated</b> statue. She was the mother of Pharaoh Amenhotep II, Prince Menkheperre, and the princesses Nebetiunet, Merytamun C, Merytamun D, and Iset.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{is coming}} this evening,' {{she said in}} her mind. A minute later, {{at the end of the}} hymn, when the {{congregation}} began to move out, Manston came down the aisle. He was opposite the end <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>seat</b> as she stepped from it, the remainder of their progress to the door being in contact with each other. Miss Aldclyffe had lingered behind.|$|E
60|$|He obeyed {{without a}} word; the car glided off. As they swung round the first corner, {{she leaned forward}} from among the {{cushions}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>seat</b> and looked at him. Then Tavernake was conscious of new things. As though by inspiration, he knew that her visit {{to the office of}} Messrs. Dowling, Spence & Company had been no chance one.|$|E
60|$|The ladies came in bareheaded, and Mrs. Gould sank low {{before the}} little tea-table. Antonia took up her usual {{place at the}} {{reception}} hour--the corner of a leathern couch, with a rigid grace in her pose and a fan in her hand. Decoud, swerving from the straight line of his march, came to lean over the high back <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|E
50|$|By virtue <b>of</b> holding <b>her</b> <b>seat</b> on city council, Belleli {{was also}} a member of the Ahuntsic-Cartierville borough council from 2001 to 2005 and again from 2008 to 2009.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Maynard {{found the}} fair object <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hopes <b>seated</b> {{in the middle}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> room with the bright {{contents}} of numerous boxes and drawers strewn in glittering heaps around her.|$|R
6000|$|... [ANNYS starts {{back with}} a cry. He crosses in front <b>of</b> <b>her</b> and <b>seats</b> himself at the table. The flowers are lying there; he throws them into the waste-paper basket.] ...|$|R
60|$|But Gonzaga was {{not easily}} discouraged. Patience {{was the one}} virtue that Valentina more than any woman--and there had been many in his young life--had inculcated into a soul that in the main was {{anything}} but virtuous. He came a step nearer, and leant lightly against the edge <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>seat,</b> his shapely legs crossed, his graceful body inclining ever so slightly towards her.|$|E
60|$|She glanced up, {{at those}} awful words, {{and for the}} first time she saw the stake and the mass of red coals--redder and angrier than ever now under the {{constantly}} deepening storm-gloom. She gasped and staggered up out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>seat</b> muttering and mumbling incoherently, and gazed vacantly upon the people and the scene about her like one who is dazed, or thinks he dreams, and does not know where he is.|$|E
60|$|She {{was sitting}} bolt upright, a slender and rigid figure {{gripping}} the sides <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>seat,</b> {{and her first}} few cries had ceased. She was clad in close-fitting dark costume, a mass of warm brown hair went out in two wings or waves {{on each side of}} her forehead; and even at that distance it could be seen that her profile was of the aquiline and eager sort, like a young falcon hardly free of the nest.|$|E
50|$|Before the election, it was {{reported}} that Democrats were concerned that McCarthy was in danger <b>of</b> losing <b>her</b> <b>seat.</b> In the end, however, McCarthy defeated Republican challenger Francis X. Becker, Jr, by a margin of 54% to 46%.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{how did you}} know?" [...] said Cordy, blushing, as she bounced out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> luxurious <b>seat</b> and whisked {{into her}} pocket the paper of {{chocolate}} creams she was seldom without.|$|R
5000|$|A {{by-election}} {{was held}} for this seat in 1938 after The Duchess <b>of</b> Atholl resigned <b>her</b> <b>seat</b> in opposition to Neville Chamberlain's policy of appeasement.|$|R
6000|$|... "But it is needful that {{something}} {{should be done}} to get for him that which is his own." [...] As she said this there came to her a sting of conscience, a thought that reminded her that, though she was not lying to her father in words, she was in fact deceiving him; and remembering her assertion to her lover that she had never spoken falsely to her father, she blushed with shame as she sat in the darkness <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|E
60|$|When Isaac {{came home}} and the {{adventure}} was told to him he laughed {{and said that he}} meant to sell Rough some day. He used to say this occasionally to tease his wife because of the dog's intense devotion to her; and she, being without a sense of humour and half thinking that he meant it, would get up out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>seat</b> and solemnly declare that if he ever sold Rough she would never again go out to the down to see what the boys were up to.|$|E
60|$|The {{first name}} called was Alice Masters, an ambitious, but terribly plain and awkward girl. She had not eaten {{anything}} {{since the middle}} of the week, and was weak and nervous with fright. She sprang out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>seat,</b> white as a dead person, and rushed up the aisle. As she stepped upon the platform she struck her toe and nearly fell. The rest laughed, some hysterically, the most of them in thoughtless derision. The blood rushed into her face and when she turned, she seemed to be masked in scarlet. She began, stammeringly, her fingers playing nervously with the seams of her dress.|$|E
50|$|Chief Justice Sarah Parker {{stepped down}} from her {{position}} on the Court in 2014 because she reached the mandatory retirement age <b>of</b> 72. <b>Her</b> <b>seat</b> {{would have been on}} the November 2014 election ballot in any event, since she was elected Chief Justice in 2006 to an eight-year term.|$|R
50|$|In this staunchly liberal {{district}} comprising St. Paul {{and some}} northern suburbs, incumbent DFL Representative Betty McCollum {{ran for a}} fourth term, opposed by Republican Obi Sium, {{an employee of the}} Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. McCollum was in no danger <b>of</b> losing <b>her</b> <b>seat,</b> and won reelection with nearly 70% of the vote.|$|R
25|$|In April, 1917, Jeannette Rankin <b>of</b> Montana took <b>her</b> <b>seat</b> as {{the first}} woman in Congress, having {{previously}} served as lobbyist and field secretary for the NAWSA. Rankin voted against the declaration of war.|$|R
