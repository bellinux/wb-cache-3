5|$|The notion <b>of</b> <b>temporal</b> finitism was {{inspired}} by the doctrine of creation shared by the three Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The Christian philosopher, John Philoponus, presented the philosophical arguments against the ancient Greek notion of an infinite past and future. Philoponus' arguments against an infinite past were used by the early Muslim philosopher, Al-Kindi (Alkindus); the Jewish philosopher, Saadia Gaon (Saadia ben Joseph); and the Muslim theologian, Al-Ghazali (Algazel).|$|E
5|$|Grammar can be {{described}} as a system of categories and a set of rules that determine how categories combine to form different aspects of meaning. Languages differ widely in whether they are encoded through the use of categories or lexical units. However, several categories are so common as to be nearly universal. Such universal categories include the encoding of the grammatical relations of participants and predicates by grammatically distinguishing between their relations to a predicate, the encoding <b>of</b> <b>temporal</b> and spatial relations on predicates, and a system of grammatical person governing reference to and distinction between speakers and addressees and those about whom they are speaking.|$|E
5|$|On board Deep Space Nine, Captain Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) {{is being}} queried by Department <b>of</b> <b>Temporal</b> Investigations agents Dulmer (Jack Blessing) and Lucsly (James W.

They had picked up a hitchhiker on the way, a human called Barry Waddle. Suddenly the ship found itself some 200 light years away from its previous location and a hundred years in the past, near Deep Space Station K7 and found the USS Enterprise in orbit. They discover that the hitch-hiker was Arne Darvin (Charlie Brill), a Klingon agent who had previously been caught by Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) on K7 whilst trying to poison a shipment of grain.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The authors {{recently}} {{demonstrated that}} extensive bone erosion correlated with a worse prognosis of the {{squamous cell carcinoma}} (SCC) <b>of</b> the <b>temporal</b> bone. The present objective {{was to investigate the}} expressions and the roles of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in SCC <b>of</b> the <b>temporal</b> bone. Study Design: Retrospective patient file review and immunohistochemical study of tissues of patients with SCC <b>of</b> the <b>temporal</b> bone. Patients: The authors examined the expressions of vimentin in 16 patients with SCC <b>of</b> the <b>temporal</b> bone by immunohistochemical analysis. Results: As expected, vimentin was expressed on SCC <b>of</b> the <b>temporal</b> bone. We regard the patient who has vimentin-positive cells as EMT-positive patient because gain of vimentin is a hallmark in the EMT reported in several types of cancer. EMT positive tumors significantly correlated with extensive bone erosion, and extensive bone erosion correlated with a worse prognosis of the SCC <b>of</b> the <b>temporal</b> bone. Conclusion: The study results suggest that EMT in tumor cells becomes an important indicator of poor prognosis in SCC <b>of</b> the <b>temporal</b> bone. Copyright © 2011 Otology & Neurotology, Inc.

Andesites appear as lava flows while dacites form lava domes and dome complexes. The rocks from the main Aucanquilcha volcano are uniformly dacitic and show little evidence <b>of</b> <b>temporal</b> variation in their composition. Potassium content ranges from 1.5 to 4%. Plagioclase is the dominant component of the magma. Clinopyroxene+orthopyroxene+amphibole (hornblende and pargasite) or amphibole+biotite+minor amounts of pyroxene are subordinate components. Apatite, ilmenite, magnetite and zircon can also be found. There is evidence of magma mixing and mingling.|$|E

While the monarch is in St. Edward's chapel, the choir recites an English {{translation of the}} hymn of thanksgiving Te Deum laudamus. St Edward's Crown {{and all the other}} regalia are laid on the High Altar of the chapel; the sovereign removes the Robe Royal and Stole Royal, exchanges the crimson surcoat for the purple surcoat and is enrobed in the Imperial Robe of purple velvet. He or she then wears the Imperial State Crown and takes into his or her hands the Sceptre with the Cross and the Orb and leaves the chapel while all present sing the national anthem.|$|E
5|$|The traditions {{established}} in the medieval period continued later. By {{the middle of the}} 15thcentury, a crown was formally worn on six religious feasts every year: Christmas, Epiphany, Easter, Whitsun, All Saints' Day, and one or both feasts of StEdward. A crown was also displayed and worn at the annual State Opening of Parliament. Around this time, three swords– symbols of kingship since ancient times– were being used in the coronation ceremony to represent the king's powers in the administration of justice: the Sword of Spiritual Justice, the Sword <b>of</b> <b>Temporal</b> Justice, and the blunt Sword of Mercy. Another emerging item of state regalia was the orb, described in Tudor inventories as a round ball with a cross of gold, which underlined the monarch's sovereignty. Orbs had been pictorial emblems of royal authority in England since the early Middle Ages but a real orb was probably not used at any English coronation until that of HenryVIII in 1509; it would be added to the coronation regalia in the 17thcentury.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} decidability {{problems}} for metric and layered temporal logics.
