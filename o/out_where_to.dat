25|$|There is a {{widespread}} stereotype of gay male speech, but not of lesbian speech. This is because {{a wider range of}} speech styles is more tolerated in women than in men and also is because lesbians have historically been less free to lay claim to the kinds of public space and networks that would provide the means for the establishment and circulation of styles. As such, the study of lesbian speech has been neglected, and linguists who are interested in the topic often have difficulty figuring <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> even begin their research.|$|E

After looking up Barry's record, the police officer told Barry that his license had been suspended and ticketed Barry for operating a vehicle on a suspended license, despite Barry's insistence to the contrary. Two days later, the D.C. Department of Motor Vehicles confirmed that Barry's license had not actually been suspended and said a computer glitch must have caused the error.|$|E

Camp authorities told them that since the charges against their clients had been dropped, while the Department of Justice figured <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> charge them, they no longer needed legal counsel. Camp authorities told them that, henceforward, all access to the captives had to be approved by Jay Johnson, the Department of Defense's General Counsel.|$|E
25|$|Australia's {{unchanged}} opening pair Mark Taylor and Geoff Marsh emerged looking typically {{aggressive and}} soon were also looking untroubled by England's blunt bowling attack. The opening pair Foster and Fraser were soon replaced by Emburey and Cook, but England's bowling {{looked out of}} depth, and struggled to work <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> bowl and Marsh and Taylor set about scoring freely. After an opening stand of 135, Marsh was caught behind tantalisingly close to his fifty, out for 47 off the bowling of a reinvigorated Botham. The loss of his partner seemed to unsettle Taylor, and he too soon fell, stumped for 85 trying to advance down the wicket to Emburey. David Boon was unusually disappointing, clean bowled by Angus Fraser for 12, and in a rare bright period for England they had taken 3 for 12 to leave Australia on 154 for 3.|$|E

[...] Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune commented that the lyric [...] "God gave you style and gave you grace," [...] Martin sings as if [...] "cataloguing the attributes he only wishes he had".

500|$|The {{gameplay}} {{was praised}} for its deep single-player missions and varied enemy types. Game Revolution highlighted {{the long and}} complex levels, but admitted that players may [...] "" [...] around in circles for hours trying to figure <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> go next. This may be enjoyable for people who like puzzles and long gameplay, but it is aggravating for more action-oriented players." [...] N64 Magazine gave high marks to the game's level design and explained that the addition of mission objectives [...] "gives the game more focus and betters its predecessor's pretty limited and fairly simple key-collection." [...] The artificial intelligence of enemies was considered more advanced than GoldenEye 007s, as enemies can take refuge behind objects and pop up to throw explosives towards the player. GamePro also noted {{that they were more}} aggressive than Dinosaur Hunters. The game's large arsenal of weapons was also praised, with GameSpot remarking that the Cerebral Bore is [...] "possibly the grossest weapon ever conceived". The multiplayer mode was praised for its use of 3D space and innovative game types.|$|E
500|$|Now {{two years}} since she signed the deal, Lavigne, who was then unknown, came to the {{attention}} of the three-piece production team The Matrix. Arista could not find the right direction for Lavigne, so the team's manager, Sandy Roberton, suggested that they work together: [...] "Why don't you put her together with The Matrix for a couple of days?" [...] According to member Lauren Christy, they had been listening to Lavigne's early songs and felt they contained [...] "a Faith Hill kind of vibe". As soon as they saw Lavigne coming into their studio, The Matrix felt that her musical direction was incongruous to her image and attitude. After talking to Lavigne for an hour, [...] "we cottoned on that she wasn't happy but couldn't quite figure <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> go". The Matrix played her songs with Faith Hill influences, because it was those kind of songs the label wanted Lavigne to sing. But Lavigne dismissed it, saying she wanted songs with punk rock inclinations. Lavigne played The Matrix a song that she had recorded and really loved, a track with sounds in the likes of the rock band System of a Down. Fortunately, prior to forming The Matrix, its members' early projects were in the pop-rock type, so they readily figured out what Lavigne wanted to record and knew exactly what to do with her. They told her to come back the following day, and in the afternoon during that day, they wrote a song that evolved into [...] "Complicated" [...] and another song called [...] "Falling Down" [...] (Falling Down appears on the Sweet Home Alabama Soundtrack). They played it to Lavigne when she came back the following day, inspiring her what path she should take.|$|E

2500|$|In September 2000, {{after the}} game had been {{released}} for Dreamcast and PC, but prior to its PlayStation 2 release, IGN held an online discussion with the developers. Zeschuk said the PlayStation 2 version, titled MDK2: Armageddon would feature the same difficulty tweaks as found in the PC version, as well as slight redesigns within most of the levels, and some gameplay tweaks. He stated [...] "MDK2: Armageddon is an improved version of MDK2, with specific features for the PS2. It's not a completely new game. But it is an improved, customized game." [...] In November, IGN held a second online chat. Zeschuk stated Sony had recently looked at the game and been very impressed; [...] "They felt the gameplay improvements we've made, combined with the difficulty levels and slick controls really make MDK2: Armageddon for PS2 the definitive version of the game." [...] Gameplay tweaks introduced in MDK2: Armageddon include bigger switches, weaker and repositioned enemies, and wider ledges in platforming sections. Additionally, red arrows {{have been used to}} mark the important parts of the levels, and flashing circles point <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> shoot certain bosses.

2500|$|The {{gameplay}} mechanics change {{once the}} player retrieves the Chronoskimmer {{at the end}} of Case 18, which sees Carmen relinquishing her stolen item to the player. Instead of staying within the same time period {{for the duration of the}} final case, the player now follows clues at each location to work <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> go next. This is a return to the 1989 version of Time mechanic. Though the player now has the ability to travel to any period in history whenever they like, Carmen may only travel to time periods that she has already visited, and therefore the game restricts the player to the time periods of the previous cases. Parts of the screen previously occupied by Carmen's notes and in-game collectible items are replaced with the Chronoskimmer slider and the travel button. Throughout this case, the player receives help from all five ACME Good Guides. Originally, players could visit a themed website for [...] "more in-depth learning" [...] about the cultures visited in the game, which included [...] "articles from Brittanica, hints, and a feedback area". THe site also had a Christopher Colombus minigame, which was linked to the finished game's tenth case. The site, along with the other Carmen Sandiego pages created by Brøderbund Software and maintained by The Learning Company, were shut down in 2005.|$|E

6000|$|Meanwhile, Henri, {{by dint of}} yelling, {{throwing}} his arms wildly about, and digging his heels into {{the sides of his}} long-legged horse, succeeded in coming close up with the bull, which once or twice turned his clumsy body half round and glared furiously at its pursuer with its small black eyes. Suddenly it stuck out its tail, stopped short, and turned full round. Henri stopped short also. Now, the sticking out of a buffalo's tail has a peculiar significance which it is well to point out. It serves, in a sense, the same purpose to the hunter that the compass does to the mariner; it points <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> go and what to do. When galloping away in ordinary flight the buffalo carries his tail like ordinary cattle, which indicates that you may push on. When wounded, he lashes it from side to side, or carries it over his back, up in the air; this indicates [...] "Look out! haul off a bit!" [...] But when he carries it stiff and horizontal, with a slight curve in the middle of it, it says plainly, [...] "Keep back, or kill me as quick as you can," [...] for that is what Indians call the mad-lazy, and is a sign that mischief is brewing.|$|E
6000|$|It is {{remarkable}} {{that about the}} time of our Saviour's coming into the world all kinds of learning flourished to a very great degree, insomuch that nothing is more frequent in the mouths of many men, even such who pretend to read and to know, than an extravagant praise and opinion of the wisdom and virtue of the Gentile sages of those days, and likewise of those ancient philosophers who went before them, whose doctrines are left upon record, either by themselves or other writers.
