Willy criticizes Charley and Bernard throughout the play, {{but it is not}} because he hates them. Rather, it's argued that he is jealous of the successes they have enjoyed, which is outside his standards.|$|E

There is a lack of suitable and affordable homes for young people in Rathfarnham and consequently they are flocking out to neighbouring suburbs such as Templeogue, Tallaght and Firhouse.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{different}} about the Basilica of Our Lady of Piat was its entrance arch. It {{was at the}} back of the church and one has to go around from the entrance to see the church façade. The arch has the phrase, Basilica Minore Nuestra Señora de Piat (Minor Basilica of Our Lady of Piat). Our Lady of Piat Basilica sports a simple facade flanked with a tall belfry. It is on top of a hill in the midst of Cagayan River with the intention of avoiding floods brought about by the seasonal overflowing of the river. The church structure is mainly made of red bricks, which is common among churches in Cagayan Valley. It is a contrast to old churches made of limestone and coral stone in many parts of the Philippines.|$|E

2500|$|Additionally, a {{study has}} been {{conducted}} on social networking and its push and pull effects. <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> mentioned is [...] "Regret and dissatisfaction correspond to push factors because regret and dissatisfaction are the negative factors that compel users to leave their current service provider." [...] So from reading this, {{we now know that}} Push motivations can also be a negative force. In this case, that negative force is regret and dissatisfaction.|$|E
2500|$|According to Advaita Vedanta, Brahman is {{the sole}} reality. The status of the phenomenal world is an {{important}} question in Advaita Vedanta, and different solutions have been proposed. The perception of the phenomenal world as real is explained by maya (constantly changing reality) and avidya ("ignorance"). Other than Brahman, everything else, including the universe, material objects and individuals, are ever-changing and therefore maya. Brahman is Paramarthika Satyam, [...] "Absolute Truth", and [...] "the true Self, pure consciousness, the only Reality (sat), since It is untinged by difference, the mark of ignorance, and since It is the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not sublatable".|$|E
2500|$|Establishing a {{timeline}} {{of his work}} is now impossible, since no document provides chronological references. Themistius, a 4th-century Byzantine rhetorician, mentions {{that he was the}} [...] "first of the known Greeks to publish a written document on nature." [...] Therefore, his texts would be amongst the earliest written in prose, at least in the Western world. By the time of Plato, his philosophy was almost forgotten, and Aristotle, his successor Theophrastus and a few doxographers provide us with the little information that remains. However, we know from Aristotle that Thales, also from Miletus, precedes Anaximander. It is debatable whether Thales actually was the teacher of Anaximander, but {{there is no doubt that}} Anaximander was influenced by Thales' theory that everything is derived from water. <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not debatable is that even the ancient Greeks considered Anaximander to be from the Monist school which began in Miletus, with Thales followed by Anaximander and finished with Anaximenes. [...] 3rd-century Roman rhetorician Aelian depicts him as leader of the Milesian colony to Apollonia on the Black Sea coast, and hence some have inferred that he was a prominent citizen. Indeed, Various History (III, 17) explains that philosophers sometimes also dealt with political matters. It is very likely that leaders of Miletus sent him there as a legislator to create a constitution or simply to maintain the colony’s allegiance.|$|E

Although OFI's results were not wonderful, this group of fresh players had gained experience and started to play like a team.

2500|$|In {{the first}} chapter, Anselm {{begins with a}} {{statement}} that anyone {{should be able to}} convince themselves of the existence of God through reason alone [...] "if he is even moderately intelligent". He argues that many different things are known as [...] "good", in many varying kinds and degrees. These must be understood as being judged relative to a single attribute of goodness. He then argues that goodness is itself very good and, further, is good through itself. As such, it must be the highest good and, further, [...] "that which is supremely good is also supremely great. There is, therefore, some <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> supremely good and supremely great—in other words, supreme among all existing things." [...] Chapter 2 follows a similar argument, while Chapter 3 argues that the [...] "best and greatest and supreme among all existing things" [...] must be responsible for the existence of all other things. Chapter 4 argues that there must be a highest level of dignity among existing things and that highest level must have a single member. [...] "Therefore, there is a certain nature or substance or essence who through himself is good and great and through himself is what he is; through whom exists whatever truly is good or great or anything at all; and who is the supreme good, the supreme great thing, the supreme being or subsistent, that is, supreme among all existing things." [...] The remaining chapters of the book are devoted to consideration of the attributes necessary to such a being. The Euthyphro dilemma, although not addressed by that name, is dealt with as a false dichotomy. God is taken to neither conform to nor invent the moral order but to embody it: in each case of his attributes, [...] "God having that attribute is precisely that attribute itself".|$|E

50|$|The Plymouth Voyager 3 was {{a minivan}} concept car {{revealed}} by Plymouth in 1989.

5000|$|After {{the failure}} of Mao’s Great Leap Forward, Mao was searching for a revolution, and <b>that</b> would <b>be</b> his Cultural Revolutions. The Cultural Revolution did bring {{important}} changes in the social character and political climate of life in China, even if {{not so much in}} it formal institutions. [...] <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> important was the power belonging to Mao. The reason for the revolution was to bring new social change in the 1960s and early years of the decade. The changes were important, nevertheless, vitally affecting the lives of {{the vast majority of the}} Chinese people. The revolution was an urban movement. It fought urban workers, students, and intellectuals.|$|R

Men like Tony {{generally}} find somebody to stand behind them, but that slackness is the only fault anybody could find in him. Tony never did a crooked thing.” ...|$|E
60|$|Only {{one obvious}} point {{occurs to me}} to add. If the Kaiser has {{more than any other}} man the sense of the poetry of the ancient things, the sword, the crown, the ship, the nation, he has the sense of the poetry of modern things also. He has one sense, and it is even a joke against him. He feels the poetry of <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> more poetic than sword or crown or ship or nation, the poetry of the {{telegram}}. No one ever sent a telegram who did not feel like a god. He is a god, for he is a minor poet; a minor poet, but a poet still.|$|E

60|$|In {{addition}} to Bostil's growing hatred for the Creeches, {{he had a}} great fear of Cordts, the horse-thief. A fear ever restless, ever watchful. Cordts hid back in the untrodden ways.

He had always gotten what he wanted--except <b>one</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>That</b> <b>was</b> a certain horse. And the horse was Sage King.|$|R
60|$|This {{beginning}} {{might be}} taken as the sign of how all would do their lessons. It is only a child here and there, generally a lonely one, to whom lessons can be anything but a toil and an obligation. Even with clever ones, who {{may be interested in}} some part of their study, some other branch will be disagreeable; and {{there is nothing in the}} whole world to be learnt without drudgery, so it would be unreasonable to expect lessons to be regarded as delightful; but there is <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> to be expected of any good child--not to enjoy lessons; not to surpass others; not to do anything surprising; only to make a conscience of doing what is required as well as possible.|$|E
60|$|On the {{day when}} my bandage was taken off for the first time, I could only see indistinctly. When I ran into {{the room at the}} rectory, I guessed it was Oscar rather than knew it was Oscar. My father's grey head, and Mrs. Finch's woman's dress, would no doubt have helped anybody in my place to fix as I did on the right man. But this is all {{different}} now. I can see his features in detail--and the result is (though I won't own it to any of them) that I find my idea of him in the days of my blindness--oh, so unlike the reality! The <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not a disappointment to me, is his voice. When he cannot see me, I close my eyes, and let my ears feel the old charm again--so far.|$|E
