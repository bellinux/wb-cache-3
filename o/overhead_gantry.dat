5|$|The jetty {{facilities}} used two cranes to offload coal, {{with the capacity}} of unloading two ships at one time, {{at a rate of}} 480 tonnes an hour. Coal was also delivered by rail to the east of the station using the Brighton Main Line which passes near the site. Coal was usually delivered to the jetty, rather than by rail. A conveyor belt system was then used to take coal to the coal storage area or directly to the station's boiler rooms. The conveyor belt system consisted of a series of bridges connected by towers. The coal storage area was a large concrete box capable of holding 75,000 tonnes of coal. This had an <b>overhead</b> <b>gantry</b> with a conveyor belt attached to the conveyor belt system, for taking coal from the coal store to the boiler rooms.|$|E
25|$|The {{boat was}} {{calibrated}} {{by measuring the}} height of the gunwales above water level at each corner with the boat unladen and then measured again when known weights had been loaded into the boat from an <b>overhead</b> <b>gantry.</b> These measurements were logged in toll-keeper's tables and copies sent to every toll office within the boat's trading range. At toll offices if a toll collector suspected an incorrect waybill (declared cargo) {{the height of the}} four corners of the boat were checked with a gauging stick and averaged to allow for uneven cargo loading. That boat's entry in the gauging table was used to determine the cargo weight. The toll fee was worked out from the weight and cargo type.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, {{upon the}} opening of the South Eastern Motorway section of the M50, the National Roads Authority erected new style gantry signage. The new signage {{retained}} typical colours and fonts but differed from older side of road signage in that it used separate overhead panels for each lane, headed with the route number in each case as well as new half-gantry signs closer to the exit. The new signage was also erected on the N2 Finglas – Ashbourne scheme and N7 Clondalkin – Naas scheme. These were the first roads in Ireland where <b>overhead</b> <b>gantry</b> signage {{has been used as a}} matter of course, instead of just very major junctions. Drivers are given clear advanced warning 1km ahead of an upcoming junction. A half gantry at the junction then directed them to their destination. The new style signage is visually clearer than older type signage with drivers able to read the gantry signage from a distance of approximately 300m on a straight stretch of road. Despite its significant advantages, the new gantry signage caused confusion because the downward arrows over the left traffic lanes seemed to indicate to drivers that they should pull out into the right lane if they wish to continue on the motorway or dual carriageway, breaking the keep left rule.|$|E

Cameras and other sensors mounted on <b>overhead</b> <b>gantries</b> register either the e-tag or the vehicle license plate number, and an amount is deducted from an eTag registered road user's account. For verification each vehicle is photographed from above for length classification, with additional {{photos of the}} front and rear number plates.

500|$|Since convincing walking {{movements}} {{had always}} been difficult to accomplish with the unevenly weighted Supermarionation puppets, the common practice at AP Films Studios was to allow walking to be implied, rather than seen, by having {{the hand of a}} puppeteer move a marionette's legs using a [...] "bobbing motion". The scene in which Lady Penelope sings Brains' lyrical version of [...] "Dangerous Game" [...] required the puppet to waltz through the Paradise Peaks ballroom set, necessitating that Brown move the character's legs out of shot while fellow operator Christine Glanville controlled the upper body from the <b>overhead</b> <b>gantry.</b>|$|E
500|$|Each puppet's {{head was}} fitted with about 10 thin {{tungsten}} steel wires. During the filming, dialogue was played {{into the studio}} using modified tape recorders that converted the feed into electronic pulses. Two of the wires relayed these pulses to the internal solenoid, completing the Supermarionation process. The wires, which were sprayed black to reduce their visibility, were made even less noticeable {{through the application of}} powder paint that matched the background colours of the set. Glanville explained the time-consuming nature of this process: [...] " [...] used to spend over half an hour on each shot getting rid of these wires, looking through the camera, puffing a bit more [...] here, anti-flare there; and, I mean, it's very depressing when somebody will say to us, 'Of course the wires showed.'" [...] Positioned on an <b>overhead</b> <b>gantry</b> with a hand-held cruciform, the puppeteers co-ordinated movements {{with the help of a}} viewfinder-powered CCTV feedback system. As filming progressed, the crew started to dispense with wires and instead manipulate the puppets from the studio floor using rods.|$|E
500|$|Scale explosions {{were created}} using {{substances}} such as fuller's earth, petrol gel, magnesium strips and Cordtex explosive. Originally filmed {{at up to}} 120 frames per second (f.p.s.), they were slowed down to 24 f.p.s. during post-production to increase their apparent magnitude and length. Gunpowder canisters were ignited to create rocket jets. The wires that electronically fired the rockets also allowed {{a member of the}} crew, holding a cruciform and positioned on an <b>overhead</b> <b>gantry,</b> to [...] "fly" [...] the model over the set. By far the most unwieldy model was Thunderbird 2, which Meddings remembered as being [...] "awful" [...] to fly. A combination of unreliable rockets and weak wiring frequently caused problems: should the former be slow to ignite, the current quickly caused the latter to overheat and snap, potentially damaging the model and even setting fire to the set. Conditions above the studio floor were often dangerous due to the heat and smoke. Although many of the exhaust sound effects used in the series were drawn from an audio library, some were specially recorded during a Red Arrows display at RAF Little Rissington in Gloucestershire.|$|E
5000|$|Taiwan Highway Electronic Toll Collection System (ETC) {{is used to}} [...] {{electronically}} collect tolls {{on national}} freeways in Taiwan. All tolls are collected electronically by <b>overhead</b> <b>gantries,</b> not at traditional toll booths. Taiwan is the first country to switch from manual tolling to all electronic, multi-lane free flow tolling on all of its freeways.|$|R
50|$|The {{rear of the}} {{building}} is divided into symmetrical gable ended sections that have central openings originally intended for goods delivery and serviced by small <b>overhead</b> <b>gantries.</b> These openings are flanked by double-hung windows on both levels. The end bay at the rear has been extended across the laneway. The laneway and rear of {{the building}} are also visually important.|$|R
50|$|The tolls are {{collected}} via a 'free-flow tolling system', an electronic tolling {{system based on}} <b>overhead</b> <b>gantries</b> reading a tag fitted inside vehicles or by taking a photograph of number plates, avoiding the need for vehicles to slow or stop. The Go via system is used. Any other Australian toll road tag will work on the Airport Link toll road.|$|R
2500|$|On the Cowbridge Drain, Baker's Bridge {{is another}} 3-arched bridge, which is listed with the {{adjacent}} sluice, while Mastin's Bridge is a single-span structure. On the Maud Foster Drain, Rawson's Bridge is an original single-span bridge, but further south, Bargate Bridge carries the A16 road over the drain in {{the centre of}} Boston. In order to accommodate additional traffic, the Department of Transport demolished {{the south side of}} the bridge in 1972, and widened the carriageway. A new south face was then constructed, using the original materials and to the same design. Two footbridges survive, built of cast iron in 1811 by the Butterley Works. The works was established in 1790 by Benjamin Outram at Ripley, Derbyshire. One is the Hospital Bridge in Boston, while the second is near Cowbridge Lock. Both carry the text [...] "CAST AT BUTTERLEY 1811" [...] stamped into the girders, and are supported by gritstone piers. Vauxhall Bridge, a third example of the type, was replaced by a road bridge in 1924. At the south end of the drain, Maud Foster sluice survives largely in original condition, although some alterations were made in the twentieth century. It consists of three elliptical arches, with gates made of timber and iron bindings. They are raised and lowered by pulleys mounted on an <b>overhead</b> <b>gantry.</b> The entrance lock at Anton's Gowt is also listed. It was altered in 1848 when the Great Northern Railway Lincolnshire loop line crossed the northern end of the lock.|$|E
