The Brushaber Court noted that the 1913 Income Tax Act was written as an indirect tax and did not violate the rule of uniformity and so it was not written as a direct tax and thus was not subject to the rule of apportionment. The Court summarized what it had decided in Pollock and then went on to state the effect of the Sixteenth Amendment with respect to income taxes: ...|$|E

2500|$|Between 1997 and 2006, the Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) on the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) {{spacecraft}} mapped {{the global}} mineral {{composition of the}} planet. TES identified two global-scale volcanic units on Mars. Surface Type 1 (ST1) characterises the Noachian-aged highlands and consists of unaltered plagioclase- and clinopyroxene-rich basalts. Surface Type 2 (ST2) is common in the younger plains north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dichotomy</b> boundary and is more silica rich than ST1. [...] The lavas of ST2 have been interpreted as andesites or basaltic andesites, indicating the lavas in the northern plains originated from more chemically evolved, volatile-rich magmas. (See Igneous differentiation and Fractional crystallization.) However, other researchers have suggested that ST2 represents weathered basalts with thin coatings of silica glass or other secondary minerals that formed through interaction with water- or ice-bearing materials.|$|E
2500|$|Brazilian Portuguese {{tends to}} adopt French suffixes as in aterrissagem (Fr. atterrissage [...] "landing [...] "), {{differently}} from European Portuguese (cf. Eur.Port. aterragem). Brazilian Portuguese (BP) {{also tends to}} adopt culture-bound concepts from French, {{but when it comes}} to technology, the major influence is from English, while European Portuguese (EP) tends to adopt technological terms from French. That is the difference between BP estação ("station") and EP gare ("train station"—Portugal also uses estação). BP trem is from English train (ultimately from French), while EP comboio is from Fr. convoi. An evident example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dichotomy</b> between English and French influences can be noted in the use of the expressions know-how, used in a technical context, and savoir-faire in a social context. Portugal uses the expression hora de ponta, from French l'heure de pointe, to refer to the [...] "rush hour", while Brazil has horário de pico, horário de pique and hora do rush.

2500|$|The {{most notable}} {{example of such}} allegories is a {{character}} whom Slug refers to as [...] "Lucy," [...] who has been purported to be a symbol {{of a range of}} different entities. In earlier Atmosphere songs, it is believed that Slug used Lucy as a means of writing about ex-girlfriends. Lucy became so prominent that Atmosphere's 2001 album bore her name, Lucy Ford: The Atmosphere EPs, with the record itself concentrating fairly heavily on women and relationships in songs such as [...] "Don't Ever Fucking Question That" [...] and [...] "Mama Had A Baby And His Head Popped Off." [...] The song [...] "Fuck You Lucy" [...] from God Loves Ugly has been said to deal with Slug's dependency on alcohol. Slug himself has since said of Lucy that he originally believed [...] "her" [...] to be a representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dichotomy</b> between himself and women. He acknowledges now that Lucy became a demonization ("Lucy Ford" [...] being a play on words for Lucifer) of himself and his dependency on alcohol, drugs, sex and validation.|$|E

5000|$|The {{northern}} and southern hemispheres of Mars are strikingly {{different from each other}} in topography and physiography. This dichotomy is a fundamental global geologic feature of the planet. Simply stated, {{the northern part of the}} planet is an enormous topographic depression. About one-third of the planet’s surface (mostly in the northern hemisphere) lies 3-6 km lower in elevation than the southern two-thirds. This is a first-order relief feature on par with the elevation difference between Earth’s continents and ocean basins. The dichotomy is also expressed in two other ways: as a difference in impact crater density and crustal thickness between the two hemispheres. The hemisphere south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dichotomy</b> boundary (often called the southern highlands or uplands) is very heavily cratered and ancient, characterized by rugged surfaces that date back to the period of heavy bombardment. In contrast, the lowlands north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dichotomy</b> boundary have few large craters, are very smooth and flat, and have other features indicating that extensive resurfacing has occurred since the southern highlands formed. The third distinction between the two hemispheres is in crustal thickness. Topographic and geophysical gravity data indicate that the crust in the southern highlands has a maximum thickness of about 58 km, whereas crust in the northern lowlands [...] "peaks" [...] at around 32 km in thickness. The location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dichotomy</b> boundary varies in latitude across Mars and depends on which of the three physical expressions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dichotomy</b> is being considered.|$|E

We present a pattern language for implementing languages that gathers together many ideas that are known in the language implementation community that should be more widely known.

We begin by discussing some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dichotomies</b> that shape <b>the</b> language design process. The pattern language itself consists of patterns describing various language flavors, and patterns for doing syntactic recognition, evaluation, and source production. ...|$|R
