500|$|The Congress of Berlin {{was held}} in June and July 1878, the central {{relationship}} in it that between Disraeli and Bismarck. [...] In later years, the German chancellor would show visitors to his office three pictures on the wall: [...] "the portrait of my Sovereign, there on the right that <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> and on the left, there, that of Lord Beaconsfield". Disraeli caused an uproar in the congress by making his opening address in English, rather than in French, hitherto accepted as the international language of diplomacy. By one account, the British ambassador in Berlin, Lord Odo Russell, hoping to spare the delegates Disraeli's awful French accent, told Disraeli that the congress was hoping to hear a speech in the English tongue by one of its masters.|$|E
500|$|A {{dissident}} Catholic, Guy Fawkes, {{was discovered}} in the cellars of the parliament buildings {{on the night of}} 4–5 November 1605, the eve of the state opening of the second session of James's first English Parliament. He was guarding a pile of wood not far from 36 barrels of gunpowder with which Fawkes intended to blow up Parliament House the following day and cause the destruction, as James put it, [...] "not only... of my person, nor <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> and posterity also, but of the whole body of the State in general". The sensational discovery of the Gunpowder Plot, as it quickly became known, aroused a mood of national relief at the delivery of the king and his sons. Salisbury exploited this to extract higher subsidies from the ensuing Parliament than any but one granted to Elizabeth. Fawkes and others implicated in the unsuccessful conspiracy were executed.|$|E

500|$|In 1895, Krøyer {{wrote to}} his friend Oscar Björck: [...] "I am also {{thinking}} of painting a large portrait <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> and me together — but for that I shall definitely need good weather, so it won't be this year." [...] In fact it was four years later, {{in the summer of}} 1899, that he finally created the large painting Summer Evening at Skagen Beach – The Artist and his Wife. The result nevertheless has a rather melancholic tone. Despite the beautiful surroundings, Marie appears distant, disappearing into the blue moonlight. Even Krøyer's own weak figure seems to be experiencing difficulty in supporting her on his arm while the closest figure of all is Rap the dog. The painting again presents the blue half-light. Krøyer particularly appreciated [...] "l'heure bleue": [...] "Skagen can look so terribly dull in the bright sunlight ... but when the sun goes down, when the moon rises up out of the sea ... in recent years this has been the time I like most of all." ...|$|E
500|$|Stan Love, Wilson's {{cousin and}} band manager, fired Landy in December 1976 when Landy doubled his fee. Landy remembered 15 Big Ones as [...] "the only major success" [...] the Beach Boys had in recent years; [...] "Brian and I did that together. Right after that, I {{had to leave}} the situation. ... I was {{interested}} in making Brian a whole human being; they [...] were interested in getting another album done in time for 1977." [...] In 1977, Wilson was asked if Landy had too much control; he said, [...] "I thought so, but there was nothing I could do about it and I eventually gave in to it.... control of my life legally through the commitment <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife....</b> He definitely helped me. It cost over a hundred thousand dollars – he charged {{a hell of a lot}} per month." [...] Wilson then reported that Landy was replaced with a new doctor, Steve Schwartz. After several sessions with Wilson, Schwartz died in a camping accident, falling off a mountain to his death.|$|E
500|$|Virginia's {{death had}} a {{significant}} effect on Poe. After her death, Poe was deeply saddened for several months. A friend said of him, [...] "the loss of his wife was a sad blow to him. He did not seem to care, after she was gone, whether he lived an hour, a day, a week or a year; she was his all." [...] A year after her death, he wrote to a friend that he had experienced the greatest evil a man can suffer when, he said, [...] "a wife, whom I loved as no man ever loved before", had fallen ill. While Virginia was still struggling to recover, Poe turned to alcohol after abstaining for quite some time. How often and how much he drank is a controversial issue, debated in Poe's lifetime and also by modern biographers. Poe referred to his emotional response to his wife's sickness as his own illness, and that he found the cure to it [...] "in the death <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife.</b> This I can & do endure as becomes a manit was the horrible never-ending oscillation between hope & despair which I could not longer have endured without the total loss of reason".|$|E

2500|$|A Democratic Progressive Party {{legislator}} in Taiwan, Yu Tien made offensive comments regarding Muslims, {{claiming they}} were a [...] "light hearted joke", linking terrorism to Muslims while campaigning. His wife had {{said she was a}} “Muslim terrorist early on … like Osama bin Laden.” Yu replied: “People have been saying that I am afraid <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife.</b> Faced with such a Muslim militant, how could I not be afraid?” He then apologized after the incident, saying he was [...] "Deeply apologetic", and [...] "We weren’t trying to connect Muslims with terrorists and we hope the public doesn’t misunderstand us. We respect every religion.” ...|$|E

[...] He said it is a mistake [...] "to take any sort of movie at face value, particularly a huge-budget motion picture like this." [...] He also stated at the Cannes Film Festival {{that he and his wife}} saw no contradiction between their faith and the film, as [...] "My heritage, and that <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> suggests that our sins have been taken away, not our brains." ...|$|E

2500|$|Molloy {{never again}} held another command. He had married Juliana Laforey, {{one of the}} daughters of Admiral Sir John Laforey, and the couple had at least three children, Charles, John and Mary. Mary married Sir John Beresford, another naval officer. In time a story began to {{circulate}} that before his marriage to Juliana, he had been engaged to marry another woman, but had behaved dishonourably. Her friends had pressed her {{to bring an action}} for breach of promise, but she refused, saying that God would judge him. The two happened to meet accidentally at Bath, whereupon she said to him [...] "Captain Molloy, you are a bad man. I wish you the greatest curse that can befall a British officer. When the day of battle comes, may your false heart fail you!" [...] Molloy's actions at the Glorious First of June, and his subsequent disgrace at the court martial were then presumed {{to be the result of}} her curse. Molloy's problems with women were not over, with the suggestion that he was dominated by his wife. A short refrain appeared in print, running: I, Anthony James Pye MolloyCan burn, take, sink and destroy;There's only one thing I can't do, upon my life!And that is, to stop the d-d tongue <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife.</b>|$|E
