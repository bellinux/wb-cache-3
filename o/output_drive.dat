25|$|The Nimbus engines were {{produced}} in two main variants, the Mark 103/503 and the Mark 105/502. The Mark 103/503 is generally {{similar to the}} Mark 105/502 except that the former has a double-caliper disc brake incorporated in the <b>output</b> <b>drive</b> shaft to provide adequate braking of the helicopter's rotor in the high winds encountered over {{the deck of a}} fast moving ship, whereas the 105/502 has a single caliper unit.|$|E
25|$|Widlar {{disposed}} with hybrid technology, {{and used}} only diffused resistors formed within the silicon die. Each {{of the nine}} NPN transistors was sized and shaped according to its function, contrary to an earlier practice of employing standard minimal-area patterns. Widlar introduced three innovations: interfacing a long-tail with a single-ended stage without losing half of the gain, shifting the DC level using only NPN transistors, and optional frequency compensation with an external capacitor. Compensation increased bandwidth of the device to 25-30MHz, an unprecedented breakthrough for monolithic amplifiers at that time. Widlar did not consider the μA702 prototype good enough for production, but Fairchild decided otherwise and rushed the chip into production in October 1964. The device set the direction for the industry for decades, despite poor common-mode rejection ratio, weak <b>output</b> <b>drive</b> capabilities, and a price of $300. According to Jack Gifford, the top management of Fairchild noticed the novelty and learned of Widlar's existence only after receiving enthusiastic feedback from the market.|$|E
500|$|The Volt {{operates}} as a pure battery electric vehicle until its battery capacity drops to a predetermined threshold from full charge. From there its internal combustion engine powers an electric generator to extend the vehicle's range as needed. When the engine is running it may be periodically mechanically linked (by a clutch) to a planetary gear set, and hence the <b>output</b> <b>drive</b> axle, to improve energy efficiency. The Volt's regenerative braking also contributes to the on-board electricity generation.

40|$|Communication in {{parallel}} computers requires a low latency router. Once a suitable routing algorithm is selected, an implementation must be designed. Issues {{such as whether}} the router should be input or <b>output</b> <b>driven</b> need to be considered. In this paper, we use simulations to compare input <b>driven</b> and <b>output</b> <b>driven</b> routing algorithms. Three algorithms, the Dally-Seitz oblivious router, the *-channels router, and the minimal triplex algorithm are evaluated. Each router is implemented as both an input and an <b>output</b> <b>driven</b> router. Experiments are run {{for each of the}} router implementations with seven different traffic patterns on both a 256 -node two dimensional mesh and torus networks. The results show that in almost all cases, the <b>output</b> <b>driven</b> router matches or outperforms the input driven router. Furthermore, we find that randomization of output buffer selection in the input driven algorithm increases its performance and substantially reduces the performance discrepancy between the input [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{approach}} to robust fault detection. The proposed scheme adopts an observer-based fault-detection scheme and is characterized by a structure of two observers. One observer estimates the plant <b>output</b> <b>driven</b> by the plant normal input. The other observer estimates the <b>output</b> <b>driven</b> by the fault. To demonstrate the proposed fault-detection scheme, a rolling mill case study is considered. This task involves the development of models for the most common occurring faults on a rolling mill - the top back-up roll eccentricity, and construction of two observers. Simulation results illustrate the applicability of the fault-detection scheme to the rolling mill example...|$|R

2500|$|Another {{example of}} a {{rotating}} device in which a reactive centrifugal force can be identified {{used to describe the}} system behavior is the centrifugal clutch. [...] A centrifugal clutch is used in small engine-powered devices such as chain saws, go-karts and model helicopters. It allows the engine to start and idle without driving the device, but automatically and smoothly engages the drive as the engine speed rises. A spring is used to constrain the spinning clutch shoes. At low speeds, the spring provides the centripetal force to the shoes, which move to larger radius as the speed increases and the spring stretches under tension. [...] At higher speeds, when the shoes can't move any further out to increase the spring tension, due to the outer drum, the drum provides some of the centripetal force that keeps the shoes moving in a circular path. The force of tension applied to the spring, and the outward force applied to the drum by the spinning shoes are the corresponding reactive centrifugal forces. [...] The mutual force between the drum and the shoes provides the friction needed to engage the <b>output</b> <b>drive</b> shaft that is connected to the drum. Thus the centrifugal clutch illustrates both the fictitious centrifugal force and the reactive centrifugal force.|$|E

50|$|A perfect {{logic gate}} would have {{infinite}} input impedance and zero output impedance, allowing a gate <b>output</b> to <b>drive</b> {{any number of}} gate inputs. However, since real-world fabrication technologies exhibit less than perfect characteristics, a limit will be reached where a gate <b>output</b> cannot <b>drive</b> any more current into subsequent gate inputs - attempting to do so causes the voltage to fall below the level defined for the logic level on that wire, causing errors.|$|R

5000|$|The {{simplest}} {{example of}} a gear train has two gears. The [...] "input gear" [...] (also known as drive gear) transmits power to the [...] "output gear" [...] (also known as driven gear).

50|$|In theory, {{it is also}} {{possible}} to provide an overdrive top gear, another indirect gear, but of a speed-up ratio rather than the reduction ratio of the other gears. The direct-drive ratio then becomes the second-to-top or third gear. This arrangement was used on some early cars, but was uncommon. Where overdrive is provided for a RWD car, this is almost always done by adding a separate overdrive gearbox to the <b>output</b> <b>driven</b> shaft of the gearbox, usually outside the gear casing.|$|R

50|$|As cables between {{line output}} and line input are {{generally}} extremely short {{compared to the}} audio signal wavelength in the cable, transmission line effects can be disregarded and impedance matching need not be used. Instead, line level circuits use the impedance bridging principle, in which a low impedance <b>output</b> <b>drives</b> a high impedance input.
