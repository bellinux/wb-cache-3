5|$|A 2004 review {{reported}} 46% of bites occurring on distal extremities of the limbs, 25% on proximal {{areas of}} limbs (upper arms and thighs), 21% on the trunk, and 7% <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> or neck. In {{some cases the}} same spider bites a victim multiple times. Historically, victims were often bitten on the genitalia, though this phenomenon disappeared as outhouses were superseded by plumbed indoor toilets. Conversely, bites <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> and neck have increased with use of safety helmets and ear muffs. Precautions to avoid being bitten include wearing gloves and shoes while gardening, not leaving clothes on the floor, and shaking out gloves or shoes before putting them on. Also, children can be educated not to touch spiders.|$|E

Terns are in general medium to large birds, typically with gray or white plumage, often with black markings <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head.</b> They have longish bills and webbed feet. They are lighter bodied and more streamlined than gulls and look elegant in flight with long tails and long narrow wings. Skimmers are tropical and subtropical species. They have an elongated lower mandible. They feed by flying low over the water surface with the lower mandible skimming the water for small fish. Thirty-two species of Laridae have been recorded in North Carolina.|$|E

They are lighter-bodied and more streamlined than gulls and look elegant in flight with long tails and long narrow wings. In Tasmania, thirteen species of gulls and terns have been recorded, five of which are vagrants. The two groups have been considered separate families, but some findings that the noddies and white tern are offshoots to the combined group have led the two to be classified as a single family for the time being.|$|E
