40|$|Meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> - <b>literacy</b> or {{illiteracy}} - {{are mentioned}} in all <b>the</b> parts <b>of</b> our lives. It {{is not about}} basic knowledge and abilities only - read, write and calculate - {{but there are many}} other abilities which are essential to manage them in common life - knowledge of ICT, finacial literacy…. It is not sufficient to know the concepts but i tis necessary to understand them in the context. The most important thing is their versatile application in real life. Functional literacy within young adults with heavy hearing handicap is a very difficult issue because of communication barrier caused by problems in understanding to a piece of text. Based on that fact, the education should be modified at a basic school and also at a high school for students with a hearing handicap so that the preparation for the common life could be <b>of</b> <b>the</b> maximum benefit. Important fact is that the students have knowledge in the specific field and also they are able to manage common life situations, e. g. searching for the job at a labour market, arranging their own housing or dealing with a bank account.

In order to make easy economic and financial sustainability, persons need to thecognitive ability to understand financial information in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> these surroundings. <b>The</b> intellectual construct inferred from this encompassing and complex process is financial literacy.

Now a combination of technologies allows almost everyone to create, reproduce, transform, and share images with friends and family, or with the world. Individuals and grassroots organisations can communicate using images alongside mainstream media, corporations and governments. There is now a great need {{for all of us}} to develop the visual literacy – or graphicacy – required to interpret and recreate images, to communicate as educated equals in this new political environment. Political advertising can use graphic design to make implications that they wouldn’t be willing to say explicitly, invoking cultural ideas and associations to make their case, sometimes misleadingly. This paper will look at some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> techniques that are commonly used in political campaigns, and discuss how we can teach people the skills they need to ‘read’ campaign materials and make informed judgments about the arguments being made. Graphicacy is a necessary skill if all citizens are to fully participate in public debate, rather than remain passive audiences. A picture may tell ‘a thousand words’, but as with all political communication it is always open to interpretation. Just as <b>the</b> prevalence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> written <b>word</b> requires <b>literacy</b> for all in a democratic society, so too must we ensure that graphicacy is not a skill that is limited to a small section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> community...|$|R

40|$|Exploring Mediacy- Challenging Literacy Print {{culture is}} contested in digital culture. Analytical {{concepts}} in literary theory and also media studies are foremost derived {{from studies of}} manuscripts and print texts. In an attempt to understand the intersections between print text and image concepts as ”new visual culture” have been elaborated. This has been necessary as production and reception of texts, in a wide sense, is fundamentally multimodal. Therefore the new concepts have been placed under the head-line ”multiliteracy”, not the least in order to describe, analyse and understand what literacy is in digital culture The theoretical development must be brought further. The problem we are facing is that <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>literacy</b> is too bound to ”littera”, <b>the</b> latin <b>word</b> for letter and in close relationship to print cukture; ”littera” is also used in different areas in order to classify objects. ”Mediacy” {{would be a better}} word to signify what should be signified, but seems in some cases be equivalent with ”digital literacy”. This is too narrow a definition <b>of</b> ”mediacy”. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> my paper will be to elaborate theoretically on <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> challenging ”literacy” exploring ”mediacy”. Medicay would <b>of</b> course include <b>the</b> skills etc connected to the production and reception of print text. In the discussion concepts as new media, writing machines, hypertextuality, cybertextuality, technotextuality, text as process, remediation, and media-specific analysis will be actualized...|$|R
