25|$|Sarir North is a {{separate}} trap with its own <b>oil-water</b> contact, 30 m deeper than Sarir C. L-65 also has an independent <b>oil-water</b> contact. The field has no gas cap; petroleum has a low gas-oil ratio between 60-225 standard ft3/bbl. Some crude differentiation occurs, probably due to gravity separation. Overall, it consists of a fairly light, waxy crude having a mean gravity of 37° API, wax content of 19%, and a sulfur content under 0.25%. The pour point ranges from 12° to 24nbsp&°C.|$|E
25|$|Each {{separator}} {{technology will}} have its own performance curve outlining optimum performance based on oil droplet size. the most common separators are gravity tanks or pits, API <b>oil-water</b> separators or plate packs, chemical treatment via DAFs, centrifuges, media filters and hydrocyclones.|$|E
25|$|Sarir C's main trap is not full to {{the spill}} point, which is downplunge {{on the ridge}} west of the structure. The oil column has a maximum height of 91 m, with a 122 m {{vertical}} closure. Crude distribution in the trap is affected by lithological variation. <b>Oil-water</b> levels are common in the main reservoir members, but the transgressive series is 43 m higher.|$|E
25|$|Gravity {{segregation}} of crude in the trap produced a peripheral tar mat in permeable intervals of the reservoir intersecting the <b>oil-water</b> level. The tar mat varies in thickness, reaching a 21 m maximum in the east. Viscous {{oil from the}} top of the tar mat has a mean gravity of 24°-25° API, a pour point of about 71nbsp&°C, wax content of 15%, and an asphaltene content of 14-22%.|$|E
25|$|The wastewaters from {{large-scale}} {{industries such as}} oil refineries, petrochemical plants, chemical plants, {{and natural}} gas processing plants commonly contain gross amounts of oil and suspended solids. Those industries use a device known as an API <b>oil-water</b> separator {{which is designed to}} separate the oil and suspended solids from their wastewater effluents. The name is derived from the fact that such separators are designed according to standards published by the American Petroleum Institute (API).|$|E
25|$|Cutting fluid {{is a type}} of coolant and {{lubricant}} {{designed specifically}} for metalworking processes, such as machining and stamping. There are various kinds of cutting fluids, which include oils, <b>oil-water</b> emulsions, pastes, gels, aerosols (mists), and air or other gases. They may be made from petroleum distillates, animal fats, plant oils, water and air, or other raw ingredients. Depending on context and on which type of cutting fluid is being considered, it may be referred to as cutting fluid, cutting oil, cutting compound, coolant, or lubricant.|$|E
25|$|Parallel plate {{separators}} {{are similar}} to API separators but they include tilted parallel plate assemblies (also known as parallel packs). The parallel plates provide more surface for suspended oil droplets to coalesce into larger globules. Such separators still depend upon the specific gravity between the suspended oil and the water. However, the parallel plates enhance the degree of <b>oil-water</b> separation. The result is that a parallel plate separator requires significantly less space than a conventional API separator {{to achieve the same}} degree of separation.|$|E
25|$|During the 2000s, Citgo faced several legal actions {{over the}} {{operation}} of its Corpus Christi, Texas oil refinery. In 2007, it was convicted of {{a violation of the}} Clean Air Act for operating an <b>oil-water</b> separator without proper pollution-control equipment. It was found not guilty of a charge of emitting illegal levels of benzene into the environment. In 2009, a fire at the alkylation unit of the same plant resulted in the release of toxic hydrofluoric acid and the injury of two workers, one with severe burns. In February 2011, the company was fined over $300,000 for the incident.|$|E
25|$|Every {{conceivable}} {{method of}} applying cutting fluid (e.g., flooding, spraying, dripping, misting, brushing) can be used, {{with the best}} choice depending on the application and the equipment available. For many metal cutting applications the ideal has long been high-pressure, high-volume pumping to force a stream of liquid (usually an <b>oil-water</b> emulsion) directly into the tool-chip interface, with walls around the machine to contain the splatter and a sump to catch, filter, and recirculate the fluid. This type of system is commonly employed, especially in manufacturing. It is often not a practical option for MRO or hobbyist metalcutting, where smaller, simpler machine tools are used. Fortunately it is also not necessary in those applications, where heavy cuts, aggressive speeds and feeds, and constant, all-day cutting are not vital.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{petroleum}} industry, 2-butoxyethanol is {{a component of}} fracturing fluids, [...] drilling stabilizers, and oil slick dispersants for both water-based and oil-based hydraulic fracturing [...] When liquid is pumped into the well, the fracturing fluids are pumped under extreme pressure, so 2-butoxyethanol is used to stabilize them by lowering the surface tension. As a surfactant, 2-butoxyethanol adsorbs at the <b>oil-water</b> interface of the fracture. The compound {{is also used to}} facilitate the release of the gas by preventing congealing. [...] It is also used as a crude <b>oil-water</b> coupling solvent for more general oil well workovers. [...] Because of its surfactant properties, it is a major constituent (30–60% w/w) in the oil spill dispersant Corexit 9527, which was widely used {{in the aftermath of the}} 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill.|$|E
2500|$|Phase {{separation}} {{of oil and}} water is not only entropy-driven, but is also driven forward to undo the increase in contact area between oil and water. Forming extra interfacial layer, as when oil droplets are in the water layer, increase the overall energy of the <b>oil-water</b> system. This is because water and oil molecules at the interface are higher in energy compared to {{when they are in}} the middle and are surrounded on all directions by their own molecules. Thus, oil droplets would move out of water phase, after letting the mixture sit for a little, to get the change in interfacial area (ΔA) as small as possible in order to minimize the energy rise of the system (ΔG). The relationship between free energy change of a system and its interfacial area is expressed in the equation: ...|$|E
2500|$|The eight {{original}} boilers {{were replaced}} by new generation, high-pressure boilers, converted to take diesel fuel utilising LSHSD instead of furnace fuel oil, each providing a steam capacity of 100 tonnes per hour. The new boilers are highly efficient and {{have high levels of}} automation. They power four propellers in four shaft configuration, producing a total thrust of [...] at the shaft, providing a top speed of over 30 knots. Six turbo alternators and six diesel alternators generate 18 MW of electricity to power various equipment. Modern <b>oil-water</b> separators as well as a sewage treatment plant were incorporated to meet international standards. Six new Finnish Wärtsilä 1.5 MW diesel generators, a Global Marine communications system, Sperry Bridgemaster navigation radar, a new telephone exchange, new data link and an IFF Mk XI system were added. Hotel services were improved with the addition of two reverse osmosis plants producing 400 tons of fresh water per day, as well as updated refrigeration and air conditioning. A new galley was installed together with improved domestic services and accommodation for 10 female officers.|$|E

50|$|A {{centrifugal}} water-oil separator, centrifugal <b>oil-water</b> separator or centrifugal liquid-liquid separator is {{a device}} designed to separate {{oil and water}} by centrifugation. It generally contains a cylindrical container that rotates inside a larger stationary container. The denser liquid, usually water, accumulates at {{the periphery of the}} rotating container and is collected {{from the side of the}} device, whereas the less dense liquid, usually oil, accumulates at the rotation axis and is collected from the center. Centrifugal <b>oil-water</b> separators are used for waste water processing and for cleanup of oil spills on sea or on lake. Centrifugal <b>oil-water</b> separators are also used for filtering diesel and lubricating oils by removing the waste particles and impurity from them.|$|E
