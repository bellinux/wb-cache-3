5|$|The small seated {{statue of}} Menkauhor wearing the robe of the Sed festival might suggest a longer reign, since this festival was {{typically}} celebrated <b>only</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> ruler had spent 30 {{years on the}} throne.

5|$|Abir re-established their {{headquarters}} at Basankusu in 1893 and its {{position at the}} confluence of the Maringa and Lopori allowed Abir to expand along the rivers and their tributaries, establishing new posts along the way. Progress was slow as the Free State's activities had made the population in the west hostile to colonisation and the east remained in the control of the Manyema and the Zanzibari slavers. The company's first post on the Lopori River had to be relocated because of threats from locals and rubber collection at Befori began <b>only</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> series of bloody conflicts between the villagers and Abir's men.|$|E

It was <b>only</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> change in the National Maximum Speed Law, when state legislators were given the authority to raise the speed limits on rural Interstate Highways to , that this segment of the Kansas Turnpike was given the I-335 designation so that it could fall under the new law.|$|E

Diving organizations such as Global Underwater Explorers (GUE) emphasize that such sessions are {{for the purpose of}} gaining experience in recognizing the onset symptoms of narcosis for an individual , which are somewhat more repeatable than for the average group of divers. Scientific evidence does not show that a diver can train to overcome any measure of narcosis at a given depth or become tolerant of it.|$|E

5|$|Initially Boutonnat and Dahan {{found it}} {{difficult}} to find a record company who would release the track, either because labels were worried about the song being censored due to the sexual nature of its lyrics or because they did not see any commercial potential in the track.

40|$|In the 1990 s, Russia and Argentina both tied their {{currencies}} to {{the dollar}} to combat inflation. They later devalued under pressure, but <b>only</b> <b>after</b> <b>an</b> extremely costly delay, and <b>only</b> <b>after</b> <b>an</b> explosive spread of monetary surrogates substituting for official currency. This article explains these puzzling developments using an institutional-sociological approach to money, which relates exchange-rate preferences to financial context ("balance sheets") rather than sectoral position, as is common. It proposes a "lock-in" mechanism explaining delayed devaluation in both cases, as well as Argentina’s greater delay, and explores the linkages between exchange-rate policy and the origins of monetary surrogates...|$|R

Boyd's performances were rewarded with selection for England B against Netherlands B, a match played {{in front of a}} crowd of 60,000 at the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam, but this, and a selection as reserve for a Football League representative team in 1954, was as close as he came to full international honours.|$|E
5|$|A {{close link}} {{existed between the}} ruler and the Sangha (Buddhist priesthood) since the {{introduction}} of Buddhism to the country. This relationship was further strengthened during Dutthagamani's reign. The monks often advised and even guided the king on decisions. This association was initially with the Mahavihara sect, but {{by the middle of}} the 1st century BC, the Abhayagiri sect had also begun to have a close link to the ruling of the country. By the end of the 3rd century AD, the Jetavana sect had also become close to the ruler. Estrangements between the ruler and the priesthood often weakened the government, as happened during the reign of Lanjatissa. Even Valagamba's resistance movement was initially hampered because of a rift with the Mahavihara, and he succeeded <b>only</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> reconciliation was affected. Some rulers patronized only one sect, but this often led to unrest in the country and most rulers equally supported all sects. Despite this, religious establishments were often plundered during times of internal strife by the rulers themselves, such as during the reigns of Dathopatissa I (639–650) and Kashyapa II (650–659).|$|E
5|$|Baldwin was {{translated}} from the see of Worcester to the see of Canterbury in December 1184, after Henry II {{let it be known}} that he would accept only Baldwin at Canterbury; the previous incumbent, Richard of Dover, had died in April that year. The monks put forward three candidates from within Christ Church Priory: Odo, who had been prior of Christ Church and was then Abbot of Battle Abbey, Peter de Leia, a Cluniac prior of Wenlock Priory and later Bishop of St David's, and Theobald, Abbot of Cluny, but none of them found favour with the English bishops. Instead, the prelates selected the king's choice, Baldwin. The selection of Baldwin took place <b>only</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> dispute between the members of the cathedral chapter of Canterbury and the suffragan bishops of Canterbury, both of whom claimed the right to elect the new archbishop.|$|E

So, while {{out on the town}} flyering the streets and ducking into record stores, NOU ran into Primal Scream, a band which had been in town recording their own album. Primal Scream then decided to attend NOU's show at the Antenna Club, and then proceeded to invite NOU to record with them in the studio the next day. Nation of Ulysses then recorded five songs with Primal Scream in nine hours, though of course <b>only</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> quick errand for some tin foil to smoke a bit of crack, according to Tim Green. These recordings are known as Memphis Demos, and include the demos of N-Sub Ulysses, 50,000 Watts, Mockingbird, Yeah, and Shakedown.|$|E
5|$|In December 1943, Eisenhower was {{appointed}} Supreme Allied Commander for Operation Overlord, {{the invasion of}} Normandy. Eisenhower wished to take Smith and other key members of his AFHQ staff with him to his new assignment, but Prime Minister Winston Churchill wanted to retain Smith at AFHQ as Deputy Supreme Commander in the Mediterranean. Churchill reluctantly gave way at Eisenhower's insistence. On New Year's Eve, Smith met with General (one day later Field Marshal) Sir Alan Brooke to discuss the transfer of key British staff members from AFHQ to Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF). Brooke released Gale <b>only</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> strong appeal from Smith, but refused to transfer Strong. A heated exchange resulted, and Brooke later complained to Eisenhower about Smith's behavior. This {{was the only time}} that a senior British officer ever complained openly about Smith. Whiteley became Chief of Intelligence (G-2) at SHAEF instead of Strong, but Eisenhower and Smith had their way in the long run, and Strong assumed the post on 25 May 1944, with Brigadier General Thomas J. Betts as his deputy.|$|E

After the capitulation of the uprising, Pilecki hid a cache of weapons in a private apartment and surrendered to the Wehrmacht on October 5, 1944. He was imprisoned at Stalag VIII-B, a German prisoner-of-war camp near Lamsdorf, Silesia. He was later transferred to Oflag VII-A in Murnau, Bavaria where he was liberated by troops of the US 12th Armored Division on April 28, 1945.|$|E

5|$|The {{background}} to the assassination begins when Alboin, {{king of the}} Lombards, a Germanic people living in Pannonia (in the region of modern Hungary), went to war against the neighbouring Gepids in 567. In a decisive battle, Alboin killed the Gepid king Cunimund and captured the king's daughter Rosamund – later marrying her to guarantee the loyalty of the surviving Gepids. The following year, the Lombards migrated to Italy, a territory then held by the Byzantine Empire. In 569 Alboin took Mediolanum (Milan), the capital of northern Italy, and by 570 he had assumed control of most of northern Italy. The Byzantine forces entrenched themselves in the strategic town of Ticinum (Pavia), which they took <b>only</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> long siege. Even before taking Ticinum, the Lombards crossed the Apennines and invaded Tuscia. After the fall of Ticinum, Alboin chose Verona as his first permanent headquarters. In this town Alboin was assassinated in 572 {{and it is in}} these circumstances that Helmichis' name is first heard of. Most of the available details are in the Historia Langobardorum.|$|E
5|$|Thus the Army of Lithuania {{did little}} to oppose the {{advancing}} Russians, and kept withdrawing before their advance. Minsk was abandoned, after some skirmishes, on 31 May. <b>Only</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> change of commander on 4 June, did the Army, now under General Józef Judycki, try to stand and fight the Russians. The Russians however defeated Judycki at the Battle of Mir on 11 June and kept advancing through the Grand Duchy. The Commonwealth army retreated towards Grodno. On 14 June the Russians took Wilno, after only a small skirmish with local garrison; on 19 June, incompetently defended Nieśwież; and on 20 June, Kaunas, this time without any opposition. Judycki, disgraced, was replaced by Michał Zabiełło on 23 June. Nonetheless, since Mir, no decisive engagements occurred in the northern theater, as Polish army withdrew in relative order towards Warsaw, after minor defeat at Zelwa, eventually taking defensive positions along the Bug river near Brest. Russians took Grodno on 5 July and Białystok on 17 July. On 23 July the Russians took Brest, defeating the local garrison, but on 24 they were defeated near Krzemień-Wieś; this last battle was the first significant Commonwealth victory on the northern front.|$|E
