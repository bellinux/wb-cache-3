40|$|I {{consider}} {{a situation in}} which heterogenous senders (applicants) compete in order to be selected by one receiver (employer). Productivity is private information to the senders, and the receiver processes imperfect signals (applications) to screen among applicants. The information-processing technology is imperfect: the accuracy of each signal in predicting the unknown productivity decreases with the total number of signals processed. I show that, for a sufficiently large <b>market,</b> information <b>overload</b> occurs as there exist equilibria in which too many people apply and the receiver neglects some applications. For any information-processing technology level, information overload equilibria emerge when the cost of sending applications is low relatively to the existing technology level. The magnitude of information overload is bounded and it is larger if the receiver cannot neglect applications. As a result, an <b>overloaded</b> <b>market</b> in which the receiver has to process all applications is less efficient than an <b>overloaded</b> <b>market</b> where neglecting excessive information is an option.

40|$|In our fast-paced, {{digitally}} <b>overloaded</b> <b>marketing</b> environment, {{consumers are}} continuously presented with alternatives to their current companies, brands, salesperson, or service provider of choice. Staying afloat {{in this type}} of environment has caused the idea of customer loyalty to become increasingly important to the sustainability of all businesses, particularly those in the financial services industry. Firms are challenged with finding creative ways of retaining customers, while demonstrating their uniqueness and value. In addition, the past 2 years have materialized into a time of turmoil within several U. S. economic markets, including the banking industry, the real estate market, and the credit market, signifying an economic recession. There exists a growing concern surrounding the behavior of financial firms and their employees. Low consumer confidence, client turnover, and negative press have all contributed to this problem, forcing companies to focus their attention on providing the best overall consumer experience. Today 2 ̆ 7 s consumers are looking for firms that can provide guidance, while catering to their individual needs, providing additional incentives, and assurances that they will have access to necessary resources to achieve financial stability. ^ The purpose of this research was to extend business-to-consumer literature by examining how customer loyalty is developed and investigate its outcomes emphasizing specific implications to the financial services industry. In addition a conceptual framework of customer loyalty was presented, detailing three categories of antecedents and two categories of outcomes. The results of the research show that loyalty to the financial planner produce high levels of switching costs, which translates to positive word-of-mouth and willingness to provide feedback, thus providing insight into {{what appears to be a}} positive overall customer experience. Greater levels of economic satisfaction and trust between the customer and the financial planner and the customer and the firm, result in the achievement of higher levels of customer loyalty with each exchange partner. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{pay attention}} on statistical methods managing relationship with customers and different approaches of estimation customer lifetime {{value for the}} company in long time period. It is an empirical type of bachelor thesis, where we will test the theoretical assumptions on the real data. During this paper we research and measure customers behavior {{in order to obtain}} quantitative outputs to adaptation marketing strategy, efficient allocation of resources and choosing key clients. On the basis of past and present behavior we simulate expected in future level of purchasing behavior and thus try to determine the most profitable target groups for high-quality application of marketing tools. Main purposes of thesis are describing various attitudes to modeling CLV, applying the model Pareto/NBD on real date of the company Práce pro Vás, to evaluate forecast applicability in practice. Following tasks will be resolved in this paper: to introduce advantages and disadvantages of each modeling CLV approach, to evaluate quality of Pareto/NBD model and to determine the advanced extensions of the research in this issue. There are various attitudes to estimation of CLV, which are described in theoretical chapters, but practical part of this paper focuses primarily on application of probability model Pareto/NBD. With the help of Pareto/NBD managers can get the information about future customers activity, i. e. expected number of transactions from real behavior a probability that customer will be active in observation period. In nowadays reality of <b>overloaded</b> <b>market,</b> almost in every business sector, every company should rely on quantitative base of marketing and choose target clients, on which to focus their marketing efforts. Exactly this need matches with described and applied in this bachelor thesis model Pareto/NBD, with it help we will estimate customer lifetime value for strategic decisions and managing relationship with customers. Finally, we will resolve continuous tasks and will achieve all the determined goals...|$|R

60|$|But {{now another}} {{alarming}} system appeared. These new bonds <b>overloaded</b> the <b>market.</b> Those {{which had been}} formerly issued were at a discount; the Board of Trade was obliged to advance, therefore, a fourth more than usual to the contractors. This seemed to satisfy that description of dealers. But as those who bought on agency were limited to no terms of mutual advantage, and the bonds on the new issue falling from three to eight, nine, and ten per cent discount, the agents were unable to furnish at the usual prices. Accordingly a discount was settled on such terms as could be made: the lowest discount, and that at two places only, was at four per cent; which, with the interest on the bonds, made (besides the earlier advance) at the least twelve per cent additional charge upon all goods. It was evident, that, as the investment, instead of being supported by the revenues, was sunk {{by the fall of}} their credit, so the net revenues were diminished by the daily accumulation of an interest accruing on account of the investment. What was done to alleviate one complaint thus aggravating the other, and at length proving pernicious to both, this trade on bonds likewise came to its period.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{seeks to}} examine the role of {{consumer}} representation in communications policymaking {{with a focus on}} the UK. It aims to review the role of the Communications Consumer Panel and to argue that there is an important role to play for a consumer advocate due to behavioural biases, information <b>overload,</b> and <b>market</b> failure. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on analysis of all relevant reports and documentation published by the Ofcom Consumer Panel, as well as participant observation carried out by the author {{as a member of the}} panel. It also analyses switching data to make the case that the communications sector may be unique in terms of the low levels of switching between suppliers. Findings: The paper finds that there is an ongoing role for a consumer advocate in media and communications and that this body should be independent of government and the regulatory agency. Research limitations/implications: The limitation of this research is that it focuses principally on only one sector, though it does reference a literature that covers other sectors, and in a paper of this length full comparison of other sectors would be impossible. Practical implications: The paper suggests that the communications sector would be well served by its own separate consumer representation body and that this should have close links to, but be independent of, Ofcom. Social implications: This paper has relevance to consumer representation in communications regulation and policy in countries beyond the UK. It examines the peculiarity of the communications market and the particular difficulties consumers face in fast moving technically challenging markets. Originality/value: The paper examines a particularly important sector of consumer representation at a time when policy on a new regulatory structure is being set. It offers the perspective of a researcher who has also been a member of the Consumer panel, and, as such, it provides valuable insight at a crucial time...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background There {{is growing}} {{interest}} {{in the use of}} cognitive, behavioural, and organisational theories in implementation research. However, the extent of use of theory in implementation research is uncertain. Methods We conducted a systematic review of use of theory in 235 rigorous evaluations of guideline dissemination and implementation studies published between 1966 and 1998. Use of theory was classified according to type of use (explicitly theory based, some conceptual basis, and theoretical construct used) and stage of use (choice/design of intervention, process/mediators/moderators, and post hoc/explanation). Results Fifty-three of 235 studies (22. 5 %) were judged to have employed theories, including 14 studies that explicitly used theory. The majority of studies (n = 42) used only one theory; the maximum number of theories employed by any study was three. Twenty-five different theories were used. A small number of theories accounted for the majority of theory use including PRECEDE (Predisposing, Reinforcing, and Enabling Constructs in Educational Diagnosis and Evaluation), diffusion of innovations, information <b>overload</b> and social <b>marketing</b> (academic detailing). Conclusions There was poor justification of choice of intervention and use of theory in implementation research in the identified studies until at least 1998. Future research should explicitly identify the justification for the interventions. Greater use of explicit theory to understand barriers, design interventions, and explore mediating pathways and moderators is needed to advance the science of implementation research. </p...|$|R

In a market equilibrium, however, context conveys payoff-relevant information to consumers. Consequently, these consumers rationally violate naïve formulations of standard choice theoretic principles. I identify informational asymmetries under which apparently anomalous behaviors, namely the compromise effect and choice <b>overload,</b> arise as <b>market</b> equilibria. Firms respond to consumers’ contextual inference; in case of the compromise effect, a firm may introduce premium loss leaders (expensive goods of overly high quality that increase the demand for other goods). (JEL D 11, D 83, M 31) Numerous studies demonstrate that seemingly irrelevant factors influence people’s decisions. Perhaps the best known examples of such influence are context effects. A consumer exhibits a context effect if her choice between two alternatives systematically depends {{on the presence of}} other options. An extensive literature demonstrates context effects in laboratory settings. One of the most widely studied context effects is the compromise effect (Itamar Simonson 1989), 1 which refers to the finding that people tend to choose the middle option. More precisely, when three alternatives are available, the middle alternative is chosen more often than when it is paired with only one other option. Figure 1 shows the compromise effect obtained by Simonson (1989). This tendency to avoid extreme options has been credited with affecting decisions ranging from the demand for wine (Daniel L. McFadden 1999) to voting (Kaisa Herne 1997) and investing (Shlomo Benartzi and Richard H. Thaler 2002). Even more telling of the importance bestowed on the compromise effect is its didactic use in books such as 101 Ways to Increase Sales (Dir...|$|R
60|$|A {{proposal}} by another person was made the July following {{the date of}} this project: {{it appears to have}} been early in the formal delivery at the board: this was for the export of one thousand four hundred and eighty chests. This, too, was accepted, but with new conditions and restrictions: for in so vast and so new an undertaking great difficulties occurred. In the first place, all importation of that commodity is rigorously forbidden by the laws of China. The impropriety of a political trader, who is lord over a great empire, being concerned in a contraband trade upon his own account, did not seem in the least to affect them; but they were struck with the obvious danger of subjecting their goods to seizure by the vastness of the prohibited import. To secure the larger adventure, they require of the China factory that Colonel Watson's ship should enter the port of Canton as an armed ship, (they would not say a ship of war, though that must be meant,) that her cargo should not be reported; they also ordered that other measures should be adopted to secure this prohibited article from seizure. If the cargo should get in safe, another danger was in view,--the <b>overloading</b> the Chinese <b>market</b> by a supply beyond the demand; for it is obvious that contraband trade must exist by small quantities of goods poured in by intervals, and not by great importations at one time. To guard against this inconvenience, they divide their second, though the smaller adventure, into two parts; one of which was to go to the markets of the barbarous natives which inhabit the coast of Malacca, where the chances of its being disposed of by robbery or sale were at least equal. If the opium should be disposed of there, the produce was to be invested in merchandise salable in China, or in dollars, if to be had. The other part (about one half) was to go in kind directly to the port of Canton.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the proposed research {{is to develop a}} cost-effective power flow controller to improve the utilization and reliability of the existing transmission, sub-transmission, and distribution networks. Over the last two decades, electricity consumption and generation have continually grown {{at an annual rate of}} around 2. 5 %. At the same time, investments in the Transmission and Distribution (T&D) infrastructure have steadily declined. Further, it has become increasingly difficult and expensive to build new power lines. As a result, the aging power-grid has become congested and is under stress, resulting in compromised reliability and higher energy costs. In such an environment it becomes important that existing assets are used effectively to achieve highest efficiency. System reliability is sacrosanct and cannot be compromised. Utility system planners are moving from radial towards networked systems to achieve higher reliability, especially under contingency conditions. While enhancing reliability, this has degraded the controllability of the network, as current flow along individual lines can no longer be controlled. The transfer capacity of the system gets limited by the first line that reaches the thermal capacity, even when majority of the lines are operating at a fraction of their capacity. The utilization of the system gets further degraded as the lines are operated with spare capacity to sustain <b>overloads</b> under contingencies. <b>Market</b> efficiency is also sub-optimal, with congestion on key corridors restricting the low-cost generators to connect to the end users, resulting in higher electricity prices for the consumers. The proposed technology offers the capability to realize a controllable meshed-network, with the ability to utilize static and dynamic capacity of the grid to provide system-wide benefits, including- increased line and system-capacity utilization, increased reliability, improved operation under contingencies, and rapid implementation. It would allow a broadening of the energy market, permitting owners to direct how energy flows on their wires, and making it easier to connect to new sources of generation. Ph. D.
