To achieve this, crews filmed the coast of Norway with an Arri Alexa camera for three days in a helicopter, {{capturing}} six hours of footage. Double Negative then embedded their CG rendering of Asgard on shots of the natural landscape. Double Negative visual effects supervisor Alex Wuttke said, [...] "The benefit <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> you have some real world terrain to work with – so you have buildings that have to convey natural features.

Chris Ryan stated; [...] "When you produce a novel it's like a child and to see it put onto screen opens it up to a greater audience.

50|$|In 1845 {{there was}} a frenzy of railway {{promotion}} in Scotland, and the Caledonian Railway, among many others, was authorised by Act of Parliament; its capitalisation was £1,500,000, to build a line from Glasgow and Edinburgh to Carlisle, linking there with English railways. Well before its Act, the Caledonian had set about capturing as many other railways, whether completed or still only proposals, as it could. It did so by concluding leases of those lines; the advantage <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the lease charge payments only became due later, and were annual percentages: no large front-end payment was necessary.|$|R
500|$|Commenting on {{the success}} of American {{producers}} such as Skrillex, Skream stated: [...] "I think it hurts a lot of people over here because it's a UK sound, but it's been someone with influences outside the original sound that has made it a lot bigger. The bad side <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{a lot of people will}} just say 'dubstep equals Skrillex'. But in all honesty it genuinely doesn't bother me. I like the music he makes." [...] Other North American artists that were initially associated with the brostep sound were Canadian producers Datsik and Excision. Their production style has been described by Mixmag as [...] "a viciously harsh, yet brilliantly produced sound that appealed more to Marilyn Manson and Nine Inch Nails fans than it did to lovers of UK garage". The brostep sound also attracted the attention of metal bands. [...] Nu metal band Korn's 2011 album The Path of Totality features several collaborations with electronic music producers, including Skrillex and Excision. [...] The term metalstep has been used for a fusion of brostep and metal.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{some recent}} {{research}} which tries {{to assess the}} impact of the Internet on profitability. It remains unclear what the total effect of computerization is on the relationship between investments and profits. Some argue that, in reality, computerization by itself does not alter the cost structure of products very much. Others argue, that computerization both enables a much faster turnover of capital, with great productivity gains and fewer employees, and permits entrepreneurs to set up business with computers at a much lower start-up cost than before. Perhaps the main effect of the internet relevant to business is that it has gigantically enlarged the possibilities for market access on a global scale: businesses set up for internet sales can reach vastly more customers in much less time. [...] The proof <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> purchases via the internet have constantly increased, often at the expense of ordinary street shops. One of the analytical problems is that the relative importance of computers, and their potential financial impact, differs considerably between different kinds of business.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "false awareness" [...] (falsches Bewusstsein) in the {{classical}} sense used by Friedrich Engels does not necessarily refer to [...] "errors" [...] {{in the content of}} awareness. It refers rather to an absence of awareness of what is really behind the ideas being worked with, how they have originated, or what the real role or effect of the ideas is. The first result <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> the ideologists believe themselves to be performing certain intellectual operations with regard to an issue, which, in reality, have quite a different significance than what they imagine. The second result is that their intellectual creations can then function as a mask for what is really at stake, precisely because the issue is portrayed in a one-sided or distorted way – without the ideologists being aware of how that works. The ideologists are aware and unaware at the same time. The problem, says Engels, is that they exaggerate the power of ideas, even to the point where ideas seem to be the cause of all that happens. This occurs especially if the intellectual productions occur at quite some distance from the practical context to which they properly refer, or if they concern specialized, highly abstract ideas which cannot easily be verified (this concept differs from the Marxism–Leninism ideology, where [...] "false consciousness" [...] is thinking which deviates from the political line of the Communist Party).|$|E

6000|$|All {{this while}} have I {{remained}} shamefully in your debt for interesting news, and I am plunged deeper into that condition by your admirable {{report from the}} Dardanelles in this a.m.'s Times. I am a backward being, alas, in these days when so much is forward; our public anxieties somehow strike {{for me at the}} roots of letter-writing, and I remain too often dumb, not because I am not thinking and feeling a thousand things, but exactly because I am doing so to such intensity. You wrote me weeks ago that you had finished your new novel--which information took my breath away (I mean by its windlike rush)--and now has come thus much of the remainder of the adventure for which that so grandly liberated you and which I follow with the liveliest participation in all your splendid sense of it and profit of it. I confess I take an enormous pleasure in the fact of the exposure of the sensitive plate of your imagination, your tremendous attention, to all these wonderful and terrible things. What impressions you are getting, verily--and what a breach must it all not make with the course of history you are practising up to the very eve. I rejoice that you finished and snipped off, or tucked in and wound up, something self-contained there--for how could you ever go back to it if you hadn't?--under that violence of rupture with the past which makes me ask myself what will have become of all that material we were taking for granted, and which now lies there behind us like some vast damaged cargo dumped upon a dock and unfit for human purchase or consumption. I seem to fear that I shall find myself seeing your recently concluded novel as through a glass darkly--which, however, will not prevent my immediately falling upon it when it appears; as I assume, however, that it is not now likely to do before the summer's end--by which time God knows what other monstrous chapters of history won't have been perpetrated! What I most want to say to you, I think, is that I rejoice for you with all my heart in that assurance of health which has enabled you so to gird yourself and go forth. If the torrid south has always been good for you there must be no amount of it that you are now not getting--though I am naturally reduced, you see, to quite abjectly helpless and incompetent supposition. I hang about you at any rate with all sorts of vows and benedictions. I feel that I mustn't make remarks about the colossal undertaking you are engaged in beyond saying that I believe with all my heart in the final power of your push. As for our news here the gist <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we are living with our eyes on you and more and more materially backing you.

6000|$|I have a brave {{letter from}} you which is too many days old--and the reason <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I became some {{fortnight}} ago a British subject. You may perhaps {{not have been}} aware that I wasn't one--it showed, I believe, so little; but I had in fact to do things, of no great elaboration, {{to take on the}} character and testify to my fond passion for the cause for which you are making so very much grander still a demonstration; so that now at any rate civis Britannicus sum, and there's no mistake about it. Well, the point is that this absolutely natural and inevitable offer of my allegiance--a poor thing but my own--and the amiable acceptance of it by the powers to which I applied, have drawn down on my devoted head an avalanche of letters, the friendliest and most welcoming, beneath which I still lie gasping. They have unspeakably touched and justified me, but I brush them all aside to-night, few of them as I have in proportion been able yet to answer, in order to tell you that their effect upon me all together isn't a patch on the pride and pleasure I have in hearing from you, and that I find your ability to write to me, and your sweet care to do so, in your fantastic conditions, the most wonderful and beautiful thing that has ever happened. Dear and delightful to me is the gallant good humour of your letter, which makes me take what you tell me as if I were quite monstrously near you. One doesn't know what to say or do in presence of the general and particular Irish perversity and unspeakability (as your vivid page reflects it;) that is, rather, nobody knows, to any good effect, but yourself--it makes me so often ask if it isn't, when all's said and done and it has extorted the tribute of our grin, much more trouble than it's worth, or ever can be, and in short too, quite too, finally damning and discouraging. However, I am willing it should display its grace while you are there to give them, roundabout you, your exquisite care, and I can fall back on my sense of your rare psychologic intelligence. Your [...] "Do write to me" [...] goes to my heart, and your [...] "I don't think the Russian affair as bad as it seems" [...] goes to my head--even if it now be seeming pretty bad to us here. But there's comfort in its having apparently cost the enemy, damn his soul to hell, enormously, and still being able to do so and to keep on leaving him not at all at his ease. I believe in that vast sturdy people quand même--though heaven save us all from cheap optimism. I scarce {{know what to say to}} you about things [...] "here," [...] unless it be that I hold we are not really in the least such fools as we mostly seem bent on appearing to the world, and that on the day when we cease giving the most fantastic account of ourselves possible by tongue and pen, on that day there will be fairly something the matter with us and we shall be false to our remarkably queer genius. Our genius is, and ever has been, to insist urbi et orbi that we live by muddle, and by muddle only--while, all the while, our native character is never really abjuring its stoutness or its capacity for action. We have been stout from the most ancient days, and are not a bit less so than ever--only we should do better if we didn't give so much time to writing to the papers that we are impossible and inexcusable. That is, or seems to be, queerly connected with our genius for being at all--so that at times I hope I shall never see it foregone: it's the mantle over which the country truly forges its confidence and acts out its faith. But the night wanes and the small hours are literally upon me--their smallness even diminishes. I am sticking to town, as you see--I find I don't yearn to eat my heart out, so to speak, all alone in the Sussex sequestration. So I keep lending my little house at Rye to friends and finding company in the mild hum of waterside Chelsea. The hum of London is mild altogether, and the drop of the profane life absolute--for I don't call the ceaseless and ubiquitous military footfall (not football!) profane, and all this quarter of the town simply bristles with soldiers and for the most part extremely good-looking ones. I really think we must be roping them in in much greater numbers than we allow when we write to the Times--otherwise I don't know what we mean by so many. Goodnight, my dear, dear boy. I hope you have harmonious news of Clare--her father has just welcomed me in the most genial way to the national fold. I haven't lately written to her, because in the conditions I have absolutely nothing to say to her but that I feel her to be in perfection the warrior's bride--and she knows that.|$|E
