5|$|Tolcapone {{inhibits}} {{the activity}} COMT, an enzyme which degrades dopamine. It {{has been used}} to complement levodopa; however, its usefulness is limited by possible complications such as liver damage. A similarly effective drug, entacapone, has not been shown to cause significant alterations of liver function.

5|$|An {{important}} feature of English cathedrals, uncommon elsewhere except in Normandy, is the large and often elaborate square central tower over the crossing. The larger of these towers range from 55 metres (182ft) at Wells to 82.5 metres (271ft) at Lincoln. The central tower may exist as a single feature as at Salisbury, Gloucester, Worcester, Norwich and Chichester <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>combination</b> with paired towers at the west front as at York, Lincoln, Canterbury, Durham and Wells. Among the cathedrals that have three towers, the central tower is usually much the tallest. At Southwell the two western towers are capped by pyramidal spires sheathed in lead.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{can cause}} {{prolonged}} bleeding after operations {{for up to}} 10 days. In one study, 30 of 6499 people having elective surgery required reoperations to control bleeding. Twenty had diffuse bleeding and 10 had bleeding from a site. Diffuse, but not discrete, bleeding {{was associated with the}} preoperative use of aspirin alone <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>combination</b> with other NSAIDS in 19 of the 20 diffuse bleeding people.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the oral}} polio vaccine is inexpensive, easy to administer, and {{produces}} excellent immunity in the intestine (which helps prevent infection with wild virus in areas where it is endemic), {{it has been the}} vaccine of choice for controlling poliomyelitis in many countries. On very rare occasions (about one case per 750,000 vaccine recipients), the attenuated virus in the {{oral polio vaccine}} reverts into a form that can paralyze. Most industrialized countries have switched to inactivated polio vaccine, which cannot revert, either as the sole vaccine against poliomyelitis <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>combination</b> with oral polio vaccine.|$|E

5|$|Hematinic {{deficiencies}} (vitamin B12, {{folic acid}} and iron), occurring singly <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>combination,</b> and {{with or without}} any underlying gastrointestinal disease, may be twice as common in people with RAS. However, iron and vitamin supplements only infrequently improve the ulceration. The relationship to vitamin B12 deficiency {{has been the subject}} of many studies. Although these studies found that 0–42% of those with recurrent ulcers suffer from vitamin B12 deficiency, an association with deficiency is rare. Even in the absence of deficiency, vitamin B12 supplementation may be helpful due to unclear mechanisms. Hematinic deficiencies can cause anemia, which is also associated with aphthous-like ulceration.|$|E
5|$|Radiotherapy {{can also}} be used before surgery in certain cases. When {{pre-operative}} imaging or clinical evaluation shows tumor invading the cervix, radiation can be given before a total hysterectomy is performed. Brachytherapy and EBRT {{can also be}} used, singly <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>combination,</b> when there is a contraindication for hysterectomy. Both delivery methods of radiotherapy are associated with side effects, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
5|$|The {{pipe organ}} is a musical {{instrument}} that produces sound by driving pressurized air (called wind) through organ pipes selected via a keyboard. Because each pipe produces a single pitch, the pipes are provided in sets called ranks, {{each of which has}} a common timbre and volume throughout the keyboard compass. Most organs have multiple ranks of pipes of differing timbre, pitch, and volume that the player can employ singly <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>combination</b> through the use of controls called stops.|$|E

40|$|Nuclear factor kB (NFkB) {{activation}} plays {{a crucial}} role in anti-apoptotic responses in response to the apoptotic signaling during tumor necrosis factor (TNFa) stimulation in Multiple Myeloma (MM). Although several drugs have been found effective for the treatment of MM by mainly inhibiting NFkB pathway, there are not any quantitative or qualitative results of comparison assessment on inhibition effect between different drugs either used alone <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>combinations.</b> Computational modeling is becoming increasingly indispensable for applied biological research mainly because it can provide strong quantitative predicting power. In this study, a novel computational pathway modeling approach is employed to comparably assess the inhibition effects of specific drugs used alone <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>combinations</b> on the NFkB pathway in MM and to predict the potential synergistic drug combinations...|$|R

5|$|One of {{the most}} common {{constituents}} of a medieval meal, either as part of a banquet or as a small snack, were sops, pieces of bread with which a liquid like wine, soup, broth, or sauce could be soaked up and eaten. Another common sight at the medieval dinner table was the frumenty, a thick wheat porridge often boiled in a meat broth and seasoned with spices. Porridges were also made of every type of grain and could be served as desserts or dishes for the sick, if boiled in milk (or almond milk) and sweetened with sugar. Pies filled with meats, eggs, vegetables, or fruit were common throughout Europe, as were turnovers, fritters, doughnuts, and many similar pastries. By the Late Middle Ages biscuits (cookies in the U.S.) and especially wafers, eaten for dessert, had become high-prestige foods and came in many varieties. Grain, either as bread crumbs or flour, was also the most common thickener of soups and stews, alone <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>combination</b> with almond milk.|$|E

5|$|Timmons' career {{declined}} {{quickly in}} the 1960s, {{in part because of}} drug abuse and alcoholism and {{partly as a result of}} frustration at being typecast as a composer and player of seemingly simple pieces of music. In 1968 he made his second, final, recording for Milestone, Do You Know the Way? In the following year he played in a quartet led by Sonny Red, with Dexter Gordon on one of the saxophonist's temporary returns to the US from Europe, and in a trio backing vocalist Etta Jones. Timmons continued to play in the early 1970s, mostly in small groups <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>combination</b> with other pianists, and mainly in the New York area.|$|E
5|$|The first {{symptoms}} of Guillain–Barré syndrome are numbness, tingling, and pain, alone <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>combination.</b> This {{is followed by}} weakness of the legs and arms that affects both sides equally and worsens over time. The weakness can take half a day to over two weeks to reach maximum severity, and then becomes steady. In one in five people, the weakness continues to progress {{for as long as}} four weeks. The muscles of the neck may also be affected, and about half experience involvement of the cranial nerves which supply the head and face; this may lead to weakness of the muscles of the face, swallowing difficulties and sometimes weakness of the eye muscles. In 8%, the weakness affects only the legs (paraplegia or paraparesis). Involvement of the muscles that control the bladder and anus is unusual. In total, about a third of people with Guillain–Barré syndrome continue to be able to walk. Once the weakness has stopped progressing, it persists at a stable level ("plateau phase") before improvement occurs. The plateau phase can take between two days and six months, but the most common duration is a week. Pain-related symptoms affect more than half, and include back pain, painful tingling, muscle pain and pain {{in the head and neck}} relating to irritation of the lining of the brain.|$|E

40|$|Comparative {{effects of}} some plant growth {{regulators}} on the germination of barley and radish seeds under high temperature stress The effects of gibberellic acid, kinetin, benzyladenine, ethylene, 24 -epibrassinolide, tri-acontanol and polyamines (cadaverine, putrescine, spermidine, spermine), alone <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>combinations,</b> on germination and early seedling growth under high temperature conditions of barley and radish seeds were studied.

Only three of the single applications gibberellic acid, kinetin and 24 -epibrassinolide could alleviate the effects of high temperature on germination of barley seeds. All the combinations composed of these three growth regulators removed more successfully this adverse effect on germination. High temperature effect on the germination of radish seeds was overcome by all the pretreatments alone <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>combinations</b> to varying degrees.
