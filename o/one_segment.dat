5|$|A {{technique}} called radioembolization {{is used to}} treat hepatocellular carcinoma and liver metastasis. Radioembolization is a low toxicity, targeted liver cancer therapy that uses millions of tiny beads made of glass or resin containing radioactive yttrium-90. The radioactive microspheres are delivered directly to the blood vessels feeding specific liver tumors/segments or lobes. It is minimally invasive and patients can usually be discharged after a few hours. This procedure may not eliminate all tumors throughout the entire liver, but works on <b>one</b> <b>segment</b> or one lobe {{at a time and}} may require multiple procedures.|$|E
5|$|By 1947, M-99 was {{completely}} paved. <b>One</b> <b>segment</b> between Litchfield and Homer was converted back to gravel surface in 1952; {{a change that}} was reverted two years later. By 1960, the former US12/M-99 concurrency through Albion was redesignated Business US12 through the city when the I-94/US12 freeway was completed. Within a year, that business loop was redesignated BL I-94 when the US12 designation {{was removed from the}} freeway and applied to the former US112; at the same time, the US112/M-99 concurrency in Jonesville became US12/M-99 as well.|$|E

5|$|New York State Route8 (NY8) is a north-south {{state highway}} {{in the central}} part of New York in the United States. It runs in a southwest-to-northeast {{direction}} from the Southern Tier to the northern part of Lake George. The southern terminus of the route is at NY10 in the town of Deposit. Its northern terminus is at a junction with NY9N in the town of Hague. Roughly midway between the two endpoints, NY8 passes through Utica, where it overlaps NY5, NY12, and Interstate790 (I-790) along <b>one</b> <b>segment</b> of the North–South Arterial.|$|E
5|$|<b>One</b> <b>segment</b> {{that was}} staged during the {{ceremony}} was an elaborate fashion show showcasing the nominees for Best Costume Design. Produced by fashion photographer Matthew Rolston, the production featured models such as Cameron Alborzian, Tyson Beckford, Tyra Banks, Marcus Schenkenberg and Joel West sporting various costumes from the five films nominated in the category. Initially, actor Jack Nicholson was approached to introduce the segment along with models Naomi Campbell and Claudia Schiffer. However, actor Pierce Brosnan accepted the role of presenter of the segment and award after Nicholson declined those respective duties.|$|E
5|$|Popular {{response}} {{was much less}} effusive. The show averaged 9 million viewers per episode, as compared to The Cosby Show, which garnered an average 63 million viewers per week. Our World was the lowest rated prime time show of the 104 that aired during the 1986-7 television season, bringing in only a 6.5/10 rating/share. <b>One</b> <b>segment</b> of the public who responded very favorably to the program was teachers, who assigned Our World as homework. ABC created a study guide for the show, mailing out some 39,000 copies a month to educators and fans.|$|E
50|$|Coupling is {{also the}} {{transfer}} of electrical energy from <b>one</b> circuit <b>segment</b> to another. For example, energy is transferred from a power source to an electrical load by means of conductive coupling, which may be either resistive or hard-wire. An AC potential may be transferred from <b>one</b> circuit <b>segment</b> to another having a DC potential by use of a capacitor. Electrical energy may be transferred from <b>one</b> circuit <b>segment</b> to another segment with different impedance by use of a transformer. This is known as impedance matching. These are examples of electrostatic and electrodynamic inductive coupling.|$|R

He then directed one of the short films in the anthology film Mumbai Cutting. In 2011, he acted in Tigmanshu Dhulia's crime thriller Shagird, portraying {{the role of the}} antagonist. After directing the thriller That Girl in Yellow Boots (2011), the two-part crime film Gangs of Wasseypur (2012) was his next release, which garnered him the Filmfare Award for Best Dialogue. In 2013, he directed a short film on eve teasing titled That Day After Everyday, and directed <b>one</b> <b>segment</b> of the anthology film Bombay Talkies (2013). In 2013, he co-produced The Lunchbox, a film that was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language, and the biographical drama Shahid. In 2011, Kashyap started another {{production company}} Phantom Films, whose first feature was the period drama Lootera (2013).|$|E
5|$|Six years later, the US25 {{designation}} was decommissioned in Michigan, {{although all}} sections {{of it are}} still state highways. The southern section from the state line northward through Monroe was renumbered M-125 and the US25 designation was removed from US24 (Telegraph Road). In the Detroit area, the connection between US24 and I-75 in Woodhaven was redesignated as an unsigned connector highway (now Connector 24). The US25 designation was removed from I-75 northward into Detroit, while the routing along Clark Street became an unsigned connector highway (now Connector 850). The routing along Fort Street and Gratiot Avenue was numbered as M-3. The US25 designation was removed from I-94, and the routing through Port Huron and northward to Port Austin became part of an extended M-25. <b>One</b> <b>segment</b> of highway near Port Huron became an unsigned highway now designed Connector 25.|$|E
5|$|Tension {{had been}} {{building}} among the base's staff in recent days, and most suspected that an attack would come {{against one of the}} border stations in the near future. Ample evidence of the coming attack was discovered by British patrols, but signs of enemy troop movements were disregarded and newly cleared positions were mistaken for ambush sites. Thus the base was continually left with the bare minimum number of men as the majority that could be spared went out on patrol. As a result of these conditions, only 36 men were present in the base {{in the early morning hours}} of 27 April 1965 when it came under ferocious attack by 150 to 400 Indonesian troops, supported by artillery and rocket fire. Immediately, the Indonesians swarmed into <b>one</b> <b>segment</b> of the trenches and destroyed one of the two mortars.|$|E

5|$|The current {{highway is}} the third to carry the M-99 designation. The others were located near Lake Michigan near Muskegon in the Lower Peninsula and Gulliver in the Upper Peninsula in the 1920s and 1930s. The current highway was first {{designated}} as parts of M-34 and M-64 in 1919. These numbers were later dropped {{in favor of an}} M-9 designation in 1929. For part of 1934, a loop route was designated M-158 in Hillsdale County that was used for a rerouted M-9 in the area. The M-99 designation was applied to the highway in 1940. Since then, the state has completed paving twice; <b>one</b> <b>segment</b> was returned to gravel surface for two years in the 1950s. The southern section in Hillsdale County was rerouted in the 1960s, and sections were converted into divided highways in the late 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The {{entire length}} of I-94 is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roadways {{important}} to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. The freeway carried 168,200vehicles on average between I-75 and Chene Street in Detroit, which is the peak traffic count in 2015, and it carried 12,554vehicles immediately west of the Blue Water Bridge in Port Huron, the lowest traffic count in 2015. As the state trunkline highway closest to the lake shore in these areas, I-94 carries the Lake Michigan Circle Tour south of Benton Harbor–St. Joseph and the Lake Huron Circle Tour in the Port Huron area. Sections through the Detroit area are named the Detroit Industrial and Edsel Ford freeways. I-94 in the state is either a four- or six-lane freeway {{for most of its}} length; <b>one</b> <b>segment</b> in the Detroit area has up to ten lanes total near the airport.|$|E
5|$|The {{sound of}} speech can be {{analyzed}} into a combination of segmental and suprasegmental elements. The segmental elements are those that follow each other in sequences, which are usually represented by distinct letters in alphabetic scripts, such as the Roman script. In free flowing speech, there are no clear boundaries between <b>one</b> <b>segment</b> and the next, nor usually are there any audible pauses between words. Segments therefore are distinguished by their distinct sounds which {{are a result of}} their different articulations, and they can be either vowels or consonants. Suprasegmental phenomena encompass such elements as stress, phonation type, voice timbre, and prosody or intonation, all of which may have effects across multiple segments.|$|E

5|$|When the US Highway System {{was formed}} on November 11, 1926, US141 ran from Milwaukee to Green Bay, and <b>one</b> <b>segment</b> {{of the modern}} highway in Michigan was {{originally}} designated US102. This other designation was decommissioned in 1928 when US141 was extended north from Green Bay into Michigan. Michigan has rebuilt the highway in stages {{over the years to}} smooth out sharp curves in the routing. Since the 1960s, the section south of Green Bay has been converted into a freeway in segments. US141 has ended southeast of Green Bay in Bellevue since the 1980s—the southern freeway segment was redesignated as I-43. The section north of Abrams, Wisconsin, was converted to a freeway in the opening years of the 21st century, with an additional divided-highway section opening a few years later.|$|E
