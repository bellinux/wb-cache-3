5|$|In 1981, Fischer {{stayed at}} the home of {{grandmaster}} Peter Biyiasas, where, over a period of four months, he defeated Biyiasas seventeen times in a series of speed games. In an interview with Sports Illustrated reporter William Nack, Biyiasas assessed Fischer's play:He was too good. There was no use in playing him. It wasn't interesting. I was getting beaten, and it wasn't clear to me why. It wasn't like I made this mistake or that mistake. It was like I was being gradually outplayed, from the start. He wasn't taking any time to think. The most depressing thing about it is that I wasn't even getting <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> game to an endgame. I don't ever remember an endgame. He honestly believes there is no one for him to play, no one worthy of him. I played him, and I can attest to that.|$|E

The plague devastated Europe, robbing it of an estimated 1/3 of its population. This, combined with the economic downturn, took its toll on the city-state. The ensuing collapse of the feudal system changed the social composition of Europe forever; {{it was one of}} the first steps <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> Ages.|$|E

The immediate consequence of the crisis was that the Suez Canal was blocked, oil supplies were interrupted, Nasser's position {{as the leader of}} Arab nationalism was strengthened, and the way was left open for Russian intrusion into the Middle East.|$|E
25|$|The folio size, 307 × 445mm, has {{the ratio}} of 1.45:1. The printed area had the same ratio, and was shifted <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> to leave a 2:1 white margin, both {{horizontally}} and vertically. Historian John Man writes that the ratio was chosen {{to be close to}} the golden ratio of 1.61:1.

25|$|La Varenne is {{credited}} with bringing sauces <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> ages with his publication and may well have invented hollandaise sauce. The French developed Isigny sauce, very similar to hollandaise, and named after the Norman town of Isigny-sur-Mer which produces the finest French butter. Isigny sauce is found in recipe books from the 19th century. However, the story that the sauce began to be called Hollandaise after WWI, when butter shortages forced imports from Holland, is clearly inaccurate. While the Norman butter helped the sauce reach a higher status, it actually dates back to when the Dutch sold butter and cheese to Europe from cattle grazed on reclaimed sea land.|$|E
25|$|In 610, the Sassanid Empire {{drove the}} Byzantine Empire <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> East, giving the Jews control of Jerusalem {{for the first}} time in centuries. The Jews in Palestine were allowed to set up a vassal state under the Sassanid Empire called the Sassanid Jewish Commonwealth which lasted for five years. Jewish rabbis ordered the restart of animal {{sacrifice}} {{for the first time}} since the time of Second Temple and started to reconstruct the Jewish Temple. Shortly before the Byzantines took the area back five years later in 615, the Persians gave control to the Christian population, who tore down the partially built Jewish Temple edifice and turned it into a garbage dump, which is what it was when the Rashidun Caliph Umar took the city in 637.|$|E
25|$|Included in that haul {{was one of}} {{the most}} famous caughts-and-bowled ever taken. Ulyett sent down a {{straight}} half-volley to Bonnor, who drove at it with all his considerable might and got it right <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the bat. The ball flew back towards the bowler with a resounding crack. It seemed to Ulyett barely to have left his hand—yet already it was flying back to him at what seemed like the speed of light. He had no time to judge it but held out the right hand instinctively, and the leather stuck, right in the middle of his palm. With the sound of Bonnor's stroke still echoing about the ground, many eyes in the gallery were looking for the area near the boundary where they thought that the ball would land. The eyes of George Giffen, the non-striker, were among the wanderers, and he was certain that everyone else must be looking for it, too: indeed, a segment of the crowd, in panic, had even opened up a space in the ring in anticipation of the ball’s descent. Giffen reckoned it to have been a very mighty drive indeed—but he could not see where it had gone. When, finally, his and other eyes were diverted back towards the pitch, they noticed Ulyett celebrating and Bonnor was departing. It soon dawned on them that Ulyett had taken the catch. Although Ulyett felt no pain in the centre of his hand, there was definitely a fair amount of it on the outside. Bonnor looked at him disgustedly, thinking it almost immoral to have done such a thing, and he walked off gloomily. The England players gathered around Ulyett in wonderment. They seemed to the Wisden correspondent to be curious as to what kind of man this was—although they were also keen to congratulate him on his evasion of impending danger. The looks on the faces of Allan Steel and Alfred Lyttelton would stay with Wisdens man for a long time. WG Grace and Lord Harris both told Ulyett that he was foolish to have attempted to take the catch: had it hit his wrist or arm instead, that bone would surely have snapped. Giffen believed that this {{was one of the}} finest catches that he had ever seen, and, although on the team which it had adversely affected, he definitely appreciated it.|$|E

5|$|Brown thus gained {{selection}} for the First Test, batting <b>out</b> <b>of</b> position in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> order while Sid Barnes and Morris opened, whereas Harvey was dropped despite making a century in Australia's most recent Test against India. This was the exact situation that had unfolded in the Worcestershire and MCC matches when Australia fielded their first-choice team; Harvey {{did not play}} and Brown batted <b>out</b> <b>of</b> position in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> order. There was a chance of Harvey receiving a last-minute call-up when Barnes was ill with food poisoning in the week {{leading up to the}} Test, but the opener recovered.|$|R
500|$|The Mongols were {{allied with}} the Song, but this {{alliance}} was broken when the Song recaptured the former imperial capitals of Kaifeng, Luoyang, and Chang'an at {{the collapse of the}} Jin dynasty. The Mongol leader Möngke Khan led a campaign against the Song in 1259 but died on August 11 during the Battle of Diaoyu Fortress in Chongqing. Möngke's death and the ensuing succession crisis prompted Hulagu Khan to pull the bulk of the Mongol forces <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> East where they were poised to fight the Egyptian Mamluks (who defeated the remaining Mongols at Ain Jalut).|$|E
500|$|In the 1974–75 season Shero led the Flyers to a 51–18–11 record. They won {{the newly}} formed Patrick Division, were first in the new Campbell Conference, and first overall in the NHL. In their opening series the Flyers swept the Toronto Maple Leafs, setting up a semi-final match-up against the New York Islanders. After taking a 3–0 series led, the Flyers lost three {{straight}} {{to set up a}} deciding seventh game. Before game seven, Shero wrote a quote by Dag Hammarskjöld – [...] "Only he deserves power who every day justifies it." [...] on the blackboard. Though Shero never admitted it, the quote was believed to be directed at centre Rick MacLeish who had underperformed in the series. MacLeish responded and in game seven he registered a hat-trick as the Flyers won the game 4–1. The win set up a Stanley Cup Finals match-up with Buffalo. Shero and the coaching staff again devised a game plan. This time it was to stop Buffalo's French Connection line. The first part of the plan was to keep Sabre's centre Gilbert Perreault <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the rink and to take away his passing options. The Flyers' centres were instructed to play close to Perreault and be physical against him, {{to the point where it}} bordered on a penalty. The second part involved wearing down the French connection. Shero made numerous line changes to keep fresh players out against the Sabre's trio. A perfect example of this part of the strategy was in game one. The French Connection took a 97-second shift and the Flyers made three line changes during that time. Shero's strategy worked, and the Flyers won their second consecutive Stanley Cup.|$|E

2500|$|As an {{aircraft}} changes speed or altitude, {{the pressure of}} the air at the inlet to the compressor will vary.

This was also used to help start the engine, allowing it to be spun up without compressing much air by bleeding off as much as possible. Bleed systems were already commonly used anyway, to provide airflow into the turbine stage where it was used to cool the turbine blades, as well as provide pressurized air for the air conditioning systems inside the aircraft.|$|E
