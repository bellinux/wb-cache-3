5|$|One of Sherman's {{significant}} contributions {{as head of}} the Army was the establishment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Command</b> School (now the Command and General Staff College) at Fort Leavenworth in 1881. Sherman stepped down as commanding general on November 1, 1883, and retired from the army on February 8, 1884.|$|E
5|$|The figures {{improved}} {{after the}} autumn 1941. More resources, better training and equipment including more capable strike aircraft resulted in increasing kill numbers. By 1942, increased numbers of better aircraft and armament enabled the offensive capabilities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Command</b> to increase dramatically.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in the mid-3rd {{century the}} {{emperors}} began to favor {{members of the}} equestrian order over senators, who had had a monopoly {{on the most important}} offices of state. Senators were stripped <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>command</b> of legions and most provincial governorships (as it was felt that they lacked the specialized military upbringing needed in an age of acute defense needs), such posts being given to equestrians by Diocletian and his colleagues—following a practice enforced piecemeal by their predecessors. The emperors, however, still needed the talents and the help of the very rich, who were relied on to maintain social order and cohesion by means of a web of powerful influence and contacts at all levels. Exclusion of the old senatorial aristocracy threatened this arrangement.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before her}} launch, there was {{considerable}} discussion of Tritons role beyond her radar picket mission. An internal Navy memorandum set forth four options for the submarine's extended use. These included configuration {{to serve as a}} command ship (SSCN) for a fleet or force commander, an advanced sonar scout for the fleet, a Regulus missile submarine (SSGN), or a minelaying submarine. However, with the exception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>command</b> ship option, all of these proposed configurations required extensive modification of her original design.|$|E
5|$|Eyre was {{promoted}} to rear-admiral on 12 August 1819 and shortly afterwards received an offer from Lord Melville to take command of the Cape and St Helena stations, {{but was unable to}} accept owing to matters of a personal nature. In 1823 he was able to accept the offer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>command</b> of the South American station, at a time when several of the former Spanish colonies were declaring independence. Eyre was able to successfully manage delicate diplomatic and military duties, and was able to protect British rights and possessions in the area during periods of upheaval. His actions in the region included signing treaties with Spain and Portugal involving the prevention of illegal slave trafficking. He stepped down after the expiration of his posting and was succeeded by Admiral Sir Robert Otway.|$|E

5|$|From its inception, the {{position}} of Minister of Defence in the government in exile was heavily contested. The appointment of Henri Rolin, an academic, to {{the position}} was particularly resented. In October 1942, Pierlot dismissed Rolin who he accused of involving himself in factional internal politics of the army, parts of which had begun to behave mutinously about their perceived inaction. To resolve the deadlock, Pierlot decided {{to take on the}} position personally. He began a major restructuring <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>command</b> structure of the infantry in an ultimately successful attempt to resolve the situation. A minor mutiny among soldiers from an artillery battery was quickly suppressed in November 1942, but Pierlot was widely criticised by the British press during the soldiers' court martial in January 1943.|$|E
5|$|General Crook finally {{understood}} {{the situation as}} his infantry and cavalry fled north through Winchester. He organized a more orderly retreat. Powell's brigade and an infantry brigade led by Colonel Rutherford B. Hayes (future President of the United States) were among the few organized units remaining. They became the rear guard against the pursuing Confederate cavalry. At one point, the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry made a charge with sabers drawn—rescuing a portion of Hayes' brigade that became {{cut off from the}} rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>command.</b>|$|E
5|$|In July 1978, Schwarzkopf became deputy {{director}} of plans at the U.S. Pacific Command in Hawaii. He then served a two-year stint as assistant division commander of the 8th Infantry Division (Mechanized) in Germany. He returned to Washington D.C. for an assignment as director of personnel management for the Army, subordinate to the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, General Maxwell R. Thurman. Schwarzkopf was promoted to major general. In June 1983, he became commanding general of the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized) at Fort Stewart, Georgia. He immediately established an extremely rigorous training regimen and became well known among the troops <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>command</b> for his strict training and aggressive personality.|$|E

5|$|It {{is unclear}} who, if anyone, {{was in charge}} of the ship at this point, as Luke Collingwood had been gravely ill for some time. The man who would {{normally}} have replaced him, first mate James Kelsall, had been previously suspended from duty following an argument on 14November. Robert Stubbs had captained a slave ship several decades earlier and he temporarily commanded Zong during Collingwood's incapacitation, but he was not a registered member of the vessel's crew. According to historian James Walvin, the breakdown <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>command</b> structure on the ship might explain the subsequent navigational errors and the absence of checks on supplies of drinking water.|$|E
5|$|OTU squadrons, {{according}} to GOC Bowhill, {{should have been}} prepared to deliver an output of three crews per month for torpedo and fighter squadrons and two for General Reconnaissance units. Only at this point did the Air Ministry revise its policy. They did so, however, in a manner which indicated it still did not appreciate the problems <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Command.</b> Bomber Command had received several months of 'working up' and breathing space from the declaration of war to the German invasion of Western Europe, but Coastal Command had not. Furthermore, Bomber Command was given permission to merge several new squadrons into OTUs. It seemed as if Bomber Command was still receiving better treatment.|$|E
5|$|Rymdkapsel is a 2013 minimalist {{real-time}} strategy {{video game}} by indie developer Grapefrukt, the studio of Martin Jonasson. Players build {{a space station}} using tetromino pieces while managing resources and minions, defending against attacks, and extending the base towards four monoliths {{at the edges of}} the level. The game was built over a year and a half and was inspired by the base-building aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Command</b> & Conquer series. It was Jonasson's first full game as an indie developer. Rymdkapsel was released on May 7, 2013 for PlayStation Mobile, and was later ported to iOS, Android, Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux. Reviewers gave the game generally favorable reviews, where they appreciated its simplicity and challenge, but not its brevity and slow start.|$|E

5|$|Shea's {{relationship}} with the engineers at North American was a difficult one. While Shea blamed North American's management for the continuing difficulties in the development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>command</b> module, project leader Harrison Storms felt that NASA itself was far from blameless. It had delayed in making key design decisions, and persisted in making significant changes to the design once construction had begun. While Shea did his part in attempting to control the change requests, Storms felt {{that he did not}} understand or sympathize with the inevitable problems involved in the day-to-day work of manufacturing.|$|E
5|$|The Romanian {{military}} {{is undergoing a}} three-stage restructuring. As of 2007, the first short-term stage was completed (reorganisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>command</b> system, implementation of the voluntary military service). The year 2015 {{marks the end of}} the second stage (operational integration in NATO and EU), while 2025 is the date when the long-term stage is to be completed (full technical integration in NATO and EU). The stages aim at modernising the structure of the armed forces, reducing the personnel as well as acquiring newer and improved technology that is compatible with NATO standards.|$|E
5|$|The {{delay in}} the CSM caused by the fire enabled NASA {{to catch up on}} man-rating the LM and Saturn V.

The capability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Command</b> Module's heat shield to survive a trans-lunar reentry was demonstrated by using the Service Module engine to ram it into the atmosphere at higher than the usual Earth-orbital reentry speed.|$|E

5|$|The design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>command</b> {{sequence}} to be {{relayed to}} the spacecraft and the calculations for each photograph's exposure time {{were developed by}} space scientists Candy Hansen of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Carolyn Porco of the University of Arizona. After the planned imaging sequence was taken on February 14, 1990, {{the data from the}} camera was stored initially in an on-board tape recorder. Transmission to Earth was also delayed by the Magellan and Galileo missions being given priority over the use of the Deep Space Network. Then, between March and May 1990, Voyager 1 returned 60 frames back to Earth, with the radio signal travelling {{at the speed of light}} for nearly five and a half hours to cover the distance.|$|E
5|$|Another aspect {{introduced}} in the game is the Dimension Link (D-Link), measured in a blue gauge on the interface. It is used to draw power from certain companions who the player characters meet during the game, such as Experiment 626, temporarily replacing the commands in the player's customized command deck with a pre-determined set of commands that differ with each D-Link. Once the command gauge is filled while performing a D-Link, a powerful finishing move is activated to take out enemies. Each finishing move has two levels which can render a finishing move more powerful than before, similar to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Command</b> System. The D-Link can only be used when its corresponding gauge is filled completely, and can be activated by pressing right on the directional pad to access the D-Link menu, followed by selecting the chosen ally.|$|E
5|$|By July 1944, No.10 Group's {{position}} in western New Guinea was complicating Northern Command's efforts to supply it, {{and the group}} was made independent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>command.</b> The next month, Northern Command headquarters transferred to Madang. In September, No.71 Wing was detached from No.10 Group to Northern Command, which {{had been given the}} task of supporting the Australian 6thDivision in the Aitape–Wewak campaign. Headquartered at Tadji in northern New Guinea, No.71 Wing comprised Nos.7, 8 and 100 Bristol Beaufort Squadrons, augmented by a flight of CAC Boomerangs from No.4 (Army Cooperation) Squadron. No.74 (Composite) Wing, which had been formed in August 1943 and was headquartered at Port Moresby, also came under the aegis of Northern Command. The command's other major operational formation was No.84 (Army Cooperation) Wing, which began moving from Australia to Torokina on Bougainville in October 1944. By this time, Northern Command controlled six squadrons in the New Guinea area. No.79 Wing, equipped with B-25 Mitchells, was earmarked for transfer from North-Western Area to Northern Command, to undertake operations in New Britain, but its proposed airfield was not ready and it was instead transferred to the First Tactical Air Force at Labuan the following year.|$|E
