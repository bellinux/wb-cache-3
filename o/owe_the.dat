5|$|Development {{began in}} 2008, when Warner Bros. took pitches from comic book writers, screenwriters and directors, opting to reboot the franchise. In 2009, a court ruling {{resulted}} in Jerry Siegel's family recapturing {{the rights to}} Superman's origins and Siegel's copyright. The decision stated that Warner Bros. did not <b>owe</b> <b>the</b> families additional royalties from previous films, but {{if they did not}} begin production on a Superman film by 2011, then the Shuster and Siegel estates would be able to sue for lost revenue on an unproduced film. Producer Christopher Nolan pitched Goyer's idea after story discussion on The Dark Knight Rises, and Snyder was hired as the film's director in October 2010. Principal photography began in August 2011 in West Chicago, Illinois, before moving to Vancouver and Plano, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|The {{action of}} assumpsit had several {{advantages}} over a writ of debt; the plaintiff could count on always having a jury, while in writs of debt the defendant could rely on wager of law, where he produced twelve people to swear he did not <b>owe</b> <b>the</b> plaintiff money and had the case dismissed. In addition, it worked for executory agreements, not just normal contracts. In 1585 {{a new form of}} the Court of Exchequer Chamber was set up, an appellate court where the Common Pleas judges held a majority, and regularly began to reverse King's Bench judgments which were based on assumpsit. This, and the conflict between the King's Bench and the Common Pleas as a whole, was problematic; a plaintiff at assizes could not be sure which sort of judge his case would come before, lending uncertainty to the law. Boyer suggests that, in this environment, the Chief Justice of the King's Bench John Popham deliberately provoked the Common Pleas to resolve the matter, and did so through Slade's Case.|$|E

Soposan settled at such temporary sites as Oke-Oyan and Aro. At Aro Soposan died and was succeeded by <b>Owe.</b> <b>The</b> migrants stayed for a number of generations and broke camp in the reign of the seventh king, Ede, who revived the westward migrations and founded a dynasty at Ketu.|$|E

50|$|The Rule of 78s {{deals with}} precomputed loans, which are loans whose finance charge is {{calculated}} before the loan is made. Finance charge, carrying charges, interest costs, {{or whatever the}} cost of the loan may be called, can be calculated with simple interest equations, add-on interest, an agreed upon fee, or any disclosed method. Once the finance charge has been identified, the Rule of 78s is used to calculate the amount of the finance charge to be rebated (forgiven) in the event that the loan is repaid early, prior to the agreed upon number of payments. It should be understood that with precomputed loans, a borrower not only <b>owes</b> <b>the</b> lender the principal amount borrowed, but <b>the</b> borrower <b>owes</b> <b>the</b> finance charge as well. If $10,000 is lent and the precomputed finance charge is $3,000, <b>the</b> borrower <b>owes</b> <b>the</b> lender $13,000 at the time the loan is made, whereas a simple interest borrower <b>owes</b> <b>the</b> lender only the $10,000 principal and monthly interest on the unpaid principal.|$|R

25|$|To these Three Kings I mainly <b>owe</b> <b>the</b> happy Christmas {{seasons of}} my {{childhood}} and I should have remained very grateful to them. Instead, I came to America and soon forgot all about them, for here at Christmas time one sees so many Santa Clauses scattered all over town. Then there is the big Christmas tree in Rockefeller Plaza, the elaborate toy windows on Fifth Avenue, the one-hundred-voice choir in Grand Central Station, the innumerable Christmas carols on radio and television—and all these things made me forget the three dear old Kings of my old childhood.|$|E
25|$|If {{another team}} signs a {{released}} player {{who had a}} guaranteed contract (as long as the player has cleared waivers), the player's original team is allowed {{to reduce the amount}} of money they still <b>owe</b> <b>the</b> player (and lower their team payroll) by the right of set-off. This is true if the player signs with any professional team—it does not even have to be an NBA team. The amount the original team gets to set off is limited to one-half the difference between the player's new salary and a pro-rated share of the minimum salary for a one-year veteran (if the player is a rookie, then the rookie minimum is used instead).|$|E
25|$|Datames {{appears to}} have {{obtained}} the highest reputation in his day for courage and ability in war, which caused his fame to extend even among the Greeks, {{though he did not}} come into personal collision with them. Cornelius Nepos (to whose biographical sketch we <b>owe</b> <b>the</b> only connected narrative of his life) calls him the bravest and most able of all non-Greek and non-Roman generals, except Hamilcar and Hannibal; but there is much confusion in the accounts transmitted to us, {{and it is difficult to}} assign the anecdotes of him recorded by Polyaenus to their proper place in his history. The chronology of the events related by Nepos is also very obscure; but according to that author and Diodorus it would appear that Datames must have died before Artaxerxes, probably 362 BC.|$|E

To that Gentleman I <b>owe</b> <b>the</b> most distinct, as well as liberal information, concerning a very interesting and important subject, the Bank of Amsterdam; of which no printed account had ever appeared to me satisfactory, or even intelligible. The name of that Gentleman is so well known in Europe, the information which comes from him must do so much honour to whoever has been favoured with it, and my vanity is so much interested in making this acknowledgment, that I can no longer refuse myself the pleasure of prefixing this Advertisement to this new Edition of my Book.|$|E
25|$|Barron {{believes}} that United States {{history is not}} accurately taught in schools, and has expressed interest in promoting African-American history throughout the New York City public school system. He has drafted legislation mandating the teaching of African-American history in required school curriculum. He has used his position as Councilman to propose renaming buildings and schools as well as decorating them with mementos of black history. He wishes to publicize black history greater, including erecting portraits of Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, as important leaders in American history. Barron proposed bills to honor America's African American heritage and such individuals as Malcolm X, Marcus Garvey, Frederick Douglass, Paul Robeson, and W.E.B. Du Bois. He drafted a bill which would have asked President George W. Bush to cancel all debts African nations <b>owe</b> <b>the</b> U.S.|$|E
25|$|On {{the second}} day of unleavened bread, that is to say the sixteenth, our people partake of the crops which they have reaped and which have not been touched till then, and esteeming it right first to do homage to God, to whom they <b>owe</b> <b>the</b> {{abundance}} of these gifts, they offer to him the first-fruits of the barley in the following way. After parching and crushing the little sheaf of ears and purifying the barley for grinding, they bring to the altar an assaron for God, and, having flung a handful thereof on the altar, they leave the rest {{for the use of the}} priests. Thereafter all are permitted, publicly or individually, to begin harvest. Since the destruction of the Temple, this offering is brought in word rather than deed.|$|E

25|$|I {{think it}} may be taken that we <b>owe</b> <b>the</b> sailors' working song as we now possess it to the Americans. How far do these songs date back? I doubt if the most ancient amongst them is much older than the century. It is {{noteworthy}} that the old voyagers do not hint at the sailors singing out or encouraging their efforts by choruses when at work. In the navy, of course, this sort of song was never permitted. Work proceeded to the strains of a fiddle, to the piping of the boatswain and his mates, or in earlier times yet, to the trumpet. The working song then is peculiar to the Merchant Service, but one may hunt through the old chronicles without encountering a suggestion of its existence prior to American independence and to the establishment of a Yankee marine.|$|E
25|$|Under a pure {{flat tax}} without deductions, every tax period a company {{would make a}} single payment to the {{government}} covering the taxes on the employees and the taxes on the company profit. For example, suppose that in a given year, a company called ACME earns a profit of 3 million, spends 2 million in wages, and spends 1 million on other expenses that under the tax law is taxable income to recipients, such as the receipt of stock options, bonuses, and certain executive privileges. Given a flat rate of 15%, ACME would then <b>owe</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) (3M + 2M + 1M) × 0.15 = 900,000. This payment would, in one fell swoop, settle the tax liabilities of ACME's employees {{as well as the}} corporate taxes owed by ACME. Most employees throughout the economy would never need to interact with the IRS, as all tax owed on wages, interest, dividends, royalties, etc. would be withheld at the source. The main exceptions would be employees with incomes from personal ventures. The Economist claims that such a system would reduce the number of entities required to file returns from about 130 million individuals, households, and businesses, as at present, to a mere 8 million businesses and self-employed.|$|E
25|$|The Operations Section is {{composed}} of the five county field offices and certain units working citywide. Within the county field offices, deputy sheriffs assigned to civil law enforcement duties are referenced as Law Enforcement Bureau (LEB) personnel. LEB deputies perform {{a wide array of}} tasks such as evictions, warrants of arrest, orders to commit, and the seizure and sale of property pursuant to judicial mandates. Businesses and individuals that <b>owe</b> <b>the</b> city money pursuant to unpaid city tax warrants, environmental control board summons, and fire and health code violation fines, are targeted for enforcement action. LEB deputies also serve a wide variety of legal process, with orders of protection considered a priority. Each county field office is complemented by civilian support staff to assist in daily administrative functions and customer service. These field offices are accessible to the public, giving citizens of the county/borough a local place to file court process in need of enforcement. Deputies of the Operations Section may be assigned to duties separate from the LEB, either within a county field office or citywide. These duties include arrests and apprehensions on behalf of other city agencies such as the Human Resources Administration, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, and the Administration for Children's Services. Deputies may be assigned to scofflaw enforcement or security duties at the city treasury. The Operations Section will also provide deputies for any other assignment as deemed necessary by the agency.|$|E

500|$|Jefferson {{had written}} a {{separate}} letter to Shelby warning him against aiding the French schemes and informing him that negotiations were under way with the Spanish regarding trade on the Mississippi. When the letter was sent on August 29, 1793, it was Jefferson's intent that it reach Shelby before Michaux did, but Shelby did not receive it until October 1793. On September 13, 1793, Michaux met with Shelby, {{but there is no}} evidence that Shelby agreed to help him. In his response to Jefferson's delayed letter, Shelby assured Jefferson that Kentuckians [...] "possess too just a sense of the obligation they <b>owe</b> <b>the</b> General Government, to embark in any enterprise that would be so injurious to the United States".|$|E
500|$|Even so, Chivers {{continued}} to praise and admire Poe (albeit careful {{to point out}} Poe's literary debt to him) {{and was one of}} the first to present a picture of the [...] "real Poe" [...] in the face of the sustained attacks on Poe's reputation by the Reverend Rufus Wilmot Griswold, the poet's literary executor. This correction took the form of a memoir now titled Chivers' Life of Poe, not published until 1952. Chivers said of Griswold that he [...] "is not only incompetent to Edit any of [...] works, but totally unconscious of the duties which he and every man who sets himself up as a Literary Executor, <b>owe</b> <b>the</b> dead." [...] Chivers {{continued to}} defend Poe's reputation until the end of his life.|$|E
500|$|In any case, Griswold, {{along with}} James Russell Lowell and Nathaniel Parker Willis, edited a posthumous {{collection}} of Poe's works published in three volumes starting in January 1850. He {{did not share}} the profits of his edition with Poe's surviving relatives. This edition included a biographical sketch titled [...] "Memoir of the Author" [...] which has become notorious for its inaccuracy. The [...] "Memoir" [...] depicts Poe as a madman, addicted to drugs and chronically drunk. Many elements were fabricated by Griswold using forged letters as evidence and it was denounced by those who knew Poe, including Sarah Helen Whitman, Charles Frederick Briggs, and George Rex Graham. In March, Graham published a notice in his magazine accusing Griswold of betraying trust and taking revenge on the dead. [...] "Mr. Griswold", he wrote, [...] "has allowed old prejudices and old enmities to steal... into the coloring of his picture." [...] Thomas Holley Chivers {{wrote a book called}} New Life of Edgar Allan Poe which directly responded to Griswold's accusations. He said that Griswold [...] "is not only incompetent to Edit any of [...] works, but totally unconscious of the duties which he and every man who sets himself up as a Literary Executor, <b>owe</b> <b>the</b> dead".|$|E
5000|$|Colonial {{treasury}} records {{confirmed that}} Robinson {{had been using}} the paper money {{he was supposed to}} destroy (in his role as treasurer), and also lending out taxes collected by local sheriffs before depositing them in the treasury. Robinson lent the currency to his political supporters, as well as used it to pay his personal debts. In December 1766, a staggering report to the House of Burgesses indicated that Robinson's estate <b>owed</b> <b>the</b> colony over £100,000. After the [...] "Robinson affair", the roles of speaker and treasurer were separated. Modern auditing established the embezzlement at £109,335 Virginia currency, very close to the estimate by Robert Carter Nicholas published in the Virginia Gazette of June 27, 1766. Moreover, records ultimately showed that, of the lawyers, judges and sureties consenting to Pendleton and his co-executors being appointed, only Baylor Walker <b>owed</b> <b>the</b> Speaker no money {{at the time of his}} death. <b>The</b> others collectively <b>owed</b> <b>the</b> estate more than £10,000.
