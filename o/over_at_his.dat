5|$|Shortly {{after the}} fourth quarter began, the Virginia Tech drive {{that began in the}} waning moments of the third quarter came to an end. The Hokies were forced to punt, and Louisville began its first drive of {{the fourth quarter}}. The Cardinals' Harry Douglas ran for 29yards on their first play of the drive. On the second, Hunter Cantwell {{completed}} a 29-yard touchdown pass to Gary Barnidge. It took Louisville just 33seconds and two plays to travel 58yards and earn a touchdown. The score gave Louisville a 24–13 lead with 13:32 remaining to play. But just as it took Louisville just two plays to score, so too did it take Virginia Tech two plays to answer the Louisville touchdown. After taking <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> team's 22-yard line, Marcus Vick completed a 54-yard pass to wide receiver David Clowney. Virginia Tech and Louisville committed offsetting 15-yard personal foul penalties before the play, to no effect on the Hokie offense. On the next play after the long pass, Cedric Humes rushed for 24yards and the answering Hokie touchdown. It took just 28seconds for Virginia Tech to answer the Louisville touchdown. Having done that, Tech went Louisville one better, successfully scoring a two-point conversion on a pass from Vick to Morgan. The touchdown and two-point conversion cut the Louisville lead to 24–21.|$|E

2500|$|During the 1993–94 season, {{being interviewed}} before his game, Gretzky {{was talking about}} a December 17 game between the Red Wings and New York Rangers, saying, [...] "he had never seen a player {{dominate}} the game the way Sergei did." [...] Later in the season, Gretzky also commented that he thought Fedorov was [...] "the best player in the game at this point." [...] Fedorov was introduced to Gretzky by Paul Coffey during the 1994 NHL All-Star Game, which led to him staying <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> Los Angeles home with his family for two weeks that year.|$|E
2500|$|A small {{minority}} of critics have expressed dissenting opinions. In his 2004 book Blockbuster, British film critic Tom Shone suggested that Vertigos critical re-evaluation has led to excessive praise, and argued for a more measured response. Faulting Sight & Sound for [...] "perennially" [...] putting the film {{on the list of}} best-ever films, he wrote, [...] "Hitchcock is a director who delights in getting his plot mechanisms buffed up to a nice humming shine, and so the Sight and Sound team praise the one film of his in which this is not the case– it's all loose ends and lopsided angles, its plumbing out on display for the critic to pick <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> leisure." [...] In 2007, poet and critic Dan Schneider criticized the ending of Vertigo as melodramatic and argued that a close examination of the film's plot reveals numerous implausibilities, such as Elster allowing someone who knew his murder plot to remain living and thus possibly reveal the plan, or the police officers at the crime scene not inspecting the tower for evidence.|$|E
2500|$|Gardner only married once, to Donna, {{and several}} {{who knew him}} made the claim that he was devoted to her. Indeed, after her death in 1960, he began to again suffer serious asthma attacks. Despite this, as many coven members slept <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> cottage due to living {{too far away to}} travel home safely, he was known to cuddle up to his young High Priestess, Dayonis, after rituals. [...] The author Philip Heselton, who largely {{researched}} Wicca's origins, {{came to the conclusion that}} Gardner had held a long-term affair with Dafo, a theory expanded upon by Adrian Bott. [...] Those who knew him within the modern witchcraft movement recalled how he was a firm believer in the therapeutic benefits of sunbathing. [...] He also had several tattoos on his body, depicting magical symbols such as a snake, dragon, anchor and dagger. In his later life he wore a [...] "heavy bronze bracelet... denoting the three degrees... of witchcraft" [...] as well as a [...] "large silver ring with... signs on it, which... represented his witch-name 'Scire', in the letters of the magical Theban alphabet." ...|$|E
