40|$|International audienceA lot {{of cases}} had arouse {{in the past decade}} about {{agreements}} between regional airports and low-cost carriers. These agreements are challenged {{on the basis of the}} State Aids European control as they rise concerns not only about competition distortions between airlines but also about fiscal competition risks among Member States or local governments. Such phenomena could be expected as regional airports are characterized by significant overcapacities and overlapping inducing a substitutability for airlines. Surprisingly, the new 2014 guidelines on State Aids granted to airlines open the way to transitory <b>operating</b> <b>aid</b> <b>schemes,</b> an option apparently at odds with the European longstanding principles. Our purpose in this paper is to demonstrate with the help of the development of a model, that such agreements can make sense from the economic point of view provided that the relationship between the carrier and the airport is no longer analyzed as a vertical chain, inducing an assessment in terms of economic dependence, but as a two-sided market. The favorable usage terms granted to low cost carriers generate additional flows on the other side, with commercial revenues from shops or parking. Consequently, subsidizing operating costs might be rational, even for a private investor in a market economy, and might be a perennial device...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the responsiveness of the demand for college to changes in student aid arising from a Danish reform. Student aid in Denmark is means-tested, so accounting for borrowing contraints in the analysis is crucial. We separately identify the e¤ect of aid from that of other observed and unobserved variables such as parental income. For the Danish case, we exploit the combination of a kinked <b>aid</b> <b>scheme</b> and the reform of the student <b>aid</b> <b>scheme</b> to identify the e¤ect of direct costs on college enrollment.

40|$|Use of inter-loop aiding for {{improving}} tracking performance {{has been widely}} researched in recent years. However, most of the previously proposed <b>aiding</b> <b>schemes</b> rely {{on the assumption that}} the aiding loop remains unaffected by received interference. This paper argues that this may not always be the case. It is likely that the performance of the aiding loop may also degrade in the case where interference is received at the aiding carrier’s frequency resulting in performance degradation of both aiding and aided loops. This paper proposes an <b>aiding</b> <b>scheme</b> that offers performance improvements in case interference corrupts both frequencies. Also, an algorithm is proposed that continuously updates the aided loop bandwidth to keep its jitter at a minimum. A relationship between the quality of the aiding signal and its effects on the performance of the aided loop is analysed. An adaptive Kalman filter-based implementation of the aiding architecture is proposed to improve the quality of aiding estimates. This implementation offers an improved margin against received interference. Simulation and real data results are presented that show improvements of 7 and 5 dB-Hz in this margin by employing the proposed <b>aiding</b> <b>scheme</b> with and without an adaptive Kalman filter...|$|R

40|$|Both the European Commission’s {{decision-making}} and the EU case-law on state <b>aid</b> <b>schemes</b> are symptomatic of the uncertainty, {{and sometimes even}} contradiction, that is implicit in treatments of State aid, a discipline which form part of the Treaty’s rules on competition, in which, nonetheless the rights that undertakings enjoy are quite limited. This article examines the current position in the case-law on whether {{it is possible for}} undertakings (whether aid beneficiaries, or their competitors) to challenge the Commission’s decision on <b>aid</b> <b>schemes,</b> meaning state measures, often implemented in the form of legislation, that address a number of beneficiaries and that may fall under the prohibition set forth in Articles 107 et seq. TFEU. This is an area in which the Commission and the Community judicature are constantly doing battle. The Commission tends to view its decisions as purely general measures, and as such not open to challenge, the judicature has shown greater flexibility towards the undertakings that bring actions before it, frequently finding that these decisions affect applicants’ positions, and are thus subject to review. The article looks in particular at recent developments in the case-law that have applied Article 263 (4) TFEU, final limb, to State aid, finding that a decision on an <b>aid</b> <b>scheme</b> may in some cases constitute a regulatory act not entailing implementing measures. The aim is to show how in this field the case-law of the European courts, while complex and not always consistent, has nonetheless sought to listen to businesses’ concerns, gradually eroding the principle favoured by the Commission, that decisions on <b>aid</b> <b>schemes</b> are an exclusive matter between the Commission and the Member States...|$|R
40|$|The {{critique}} of the Legal <b>Aid</b> <b>scheme</b> is on two levels. Firstly ‘technical’ problems are discussed. It is {{in the nature of}} these problems that they can be resolved within the present structural arrangement of the scheme. The administrative procedures, use and coverage of the scheme are examined, taking into account the view point of the consumer. Privately paying and legal aid clients are compared in terms {{of the quality of the}} service they receive, solicitors’ attitudes to them, and the differing nature of the problems of poor people. The argument then concentrates on the 'structural’ defects of the scheme, avoiding the minutiae of its workings. The proprietry of a scheme created to provide legal services to poor people through solicitors in private practice is questioned. The legally orientated theory underlying the Legal <b>Aid</b> <b>scheme</b> is contrasted to social and consumer based theories, and to the practical model of the American Neighbourhood Law Firm. Empirical research is used to highlight the deficiency in the distribution of private practice solicitors to meet the needs of the poor; and the compensatory role of advice agencies in providing the relevant legal services to them. The Legal Aid Act 1988 is subjected to a close analysis with particular emphasis on the Lord Chancellor's powers, and the creation of the Legal Aid Board. The role and agenda of the Board, and future of the Legal <b>Aid</b> <b>scheme</b> are considered by outlining and examining the proposals contained in the preceding White Paper. Conclusions are drawn as to the possible results of the Act, and its value in relation to the previous {{critique of}} the Legal <b>Aid</b> <b>scheme...</b>|$|R
