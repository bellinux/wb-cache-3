In each case he sandblasted and cut the <b>optical</b> <b>disc,</b> draping, and in one case piercing, the disc with fluid, cased glass forms. These were followed, in 1978, by Littleton’s Solid Geometry series, in which heavy cased glass forms were cut into trapezoidal, spheroid and ovoid shapes and highly polished.|$|E
5|$|The UX52VS has {{the option}} of Intel's {{ultra-low}} voltage i5 or i7 mobile processors, up to 10GB of RAM and an <b>optical</b> <b>disc</b> drive. The latter is a first for the Zenbook product series. It drew criticism for its high price and lack of touch screen, but the screen quality, keyboard and system speed were praised. The battery life was considered acceptable {{taking into account the}} form-factor and the discrete GPU, despite it being significantly shorter than the UX31A.|$|E
5|$|Some USB devices {{require more}} power than is {{permitted}} by the specifications for a single port. This is common for external hard and <b>optical</b> <b>disc</b> drives, and generally for devices with motors or lamps. Such devices can use an external power supply, which is allowed by the standard, or use a dual-input USB cable, one input of which is used for power and data transfer, the other solely for power, which makes the device a non-standard USB device. Some USB ports and external hubs can, in practice, supply more power to USB devices than required by the specification but a standard-compliant device may not depend on this.|$|E

5|$|The Nintendo DS (NDS) {{features}} a touch screen and built-in microphone, and supports wireless IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) standards. Additionally, the {{revised version of}} the NDS, the Nintendo DSi, features two built in cameras, the ability to download games from the DSi store, and a web browser. The PlayStation Portable (PSP) released later the same year on December 12, 2004, followed a different pattern. It became the first handheld video game console to use an <b>optical</b> <b>disc</b> format, Universal Media Disc (UMD), as its primary storage media. Sony also gave the PSP robust multi-media capability, connectivity with the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2 (only on some games), other PSPs, as well as Internet connectivity. The Nintendo DS likewise had connectivity to the internet through the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and Nintendo DS Browser, as well as wireless connectivity to other DS systems and Wii consoles. Despite high sales numbers for both consoles, PlayStation Portable sales have consistently lagged behind those of the Nintendo DS; nevertheless, the PlayStation Portable has {{the distinction of being}} the best-selling non-Nintendo handheld gaming system.|$|E
5|$|The series {{affected}} Square's {{business on}} several levels. The commercial failure of Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within resulted in hesitation and delays from Enix during merger discussions with Square. Square's decision to produce games {{exclusively for the}} Sony PlayStation—a move followed by Enix's decision with the Dragon Quest series—severed their relationship with Nintendo. Final Fantasy games were absent from Nintendo consoles, specifically the Nintendo 64, for seven years. Critics attribute the switch of strong third-party titles like the Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest games to Sony's PlayStation, {{and away from the}} Nintendo 64, as one of the reasons behind PlayStation being the more successful of the two consoles. The release of the Nintendo GameCube, which used <b>optical</b> <b>disc</b> media, in 2001 caught the attention of Square. To produce games for the system, Square created the shell company The Game Designers Studio and released Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, which spawned its own metaseries within the main franchise. Final FantasyXIs lack of an online method of subscription cancellation prompted the creation of legislation in Illinois that requires internet gaming services to provide such a method to the state's residents.|$|E

The format is similar in design and specifications to Blu-ray Disc, with a capacity of 25GB per layer, but the discs themselves have a soft, rounded rim. Unlike previous Nintendo consoles, game manuals are only available digitally. The console is region locked; software purchased in a region can be only played on that region's hardware.|$|E

This study examines the possibilities for responsible environmental management of the growing waste stream of <b>optical</b> <b>discs</b> from households around the world. It reviews options for reducing materials used in disc manufacture, models for collection and processing of waste discs, and the differing policies and practices of various countries with respect to e-waste in general and <b>optical</b> <b>discs</b> in particular. The study concludes that environmentally responsible management of <b>optical</b> <b>discs</b> is lacking in all nations, and that optimal implementation of best practices will require the cooperation of governments, corporations, and consumers. It recommends implementation of curbside pickup and corporate mail-in programs for unwanted discs. It also concludes that effective policy-making and process design will require more and better quantitative data about the efficacy of various regulatory models and responsibility structures, and about {{the environmental impacts of}} various waste processing and recycling methods...|$|R
