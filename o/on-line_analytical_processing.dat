40|$|Many new {{applications}} that involve decision making need online (i. e., OLAP-styled) preference analysis with multidimensional boolean selections. Typical preference queries includes top-k queries and skyline queries. An analytical query {{often comes with}} a set of boolean predicates that constrain a target subset of data, which, may also vary incrementally by drilling/rolling operators. To efficiently support preference queries with multiple boolean predicates, neither boolean-thenpreference nor preference-then-boolean approach is satisfactory. To integrate boolean pruning and preference pruning in a unified framework, we propose signature, a new materialization measure for multi-dimensional group-bys. Based on this, we propose P-Cube (i. e., data cube for preference queries) and study its complete life cycle, including signature generation, compression, decomposition, incremental maintenance and usage for efficient <b>on-line</b> <b>analytical</b> query <b>processing.</b> We present a signature-based progressive algorithm that is able to simultaneously push boolean and preference constraints deep into the database search. Our performance study shows that the proposed method achieves at least one order of magnitude speed-up over existing approaches. ...|$|R

Real-time {{surveillance}} systems, telecommunication systems, {{and other}} dynamic environments often generate tremendous (potentially infinite) volume of stream data: the volume is too huge to be scanned multiple times.

To discover such high-level characteristics, one may need to perform <b>on-line</b> multi-level, multi-dimensional <b>analytical</b> <b>processing</b> of stream data. In this paper, we propose an architecture, called stream cube, to facilitate on-line, multi-dimensional, multi-level analysis of stream data. For fast online multi-dimensional analysis of stream data, three important techniques are proposed for efficient and effective computation of stream cubes. First, a tilted time frame model is proposed as a multi-resolution model to register time-related data: the more recent data are registered at finer resolution, whereas the more distant data are registered at coarser resolution. This design reduces the overall storage of time-related data and adapts nicely to the data analysis tasks commonly encountered in practice.

40|$|Abstract — It is not {{new that}} <b>on-line</b> <b>analytical</b> <b>processing</b> systems arose to {{companies}} to stay. They {{have the ability to}} change the most common application scenarios that decision-makers use on their everyday tasks. The large flexibility in data exploration and high performance response levels to queries these systems have make them very useful tools for exploring multidimensional data accordingly to the most diverse analysis perspectives of decision-makers. However, despite all the computational resources and techniques we have today, sometimes, {{it is very hard to}} maintain such levels of performance for all application scenarios, analytical systems, or user demands. When context conditions and application requirements change, performance losses may occur. There are a lot of strategies, techniques and mechanism that were designed and developed to avoid (or at least to attenuate) such undesirable low performance situations with the purpose to reduce especially data servers load. <b>On-line</b> <b>analytical</b> <b>processing</b> systems caching is one of them, designed for maintaining previous queries and serving them upon subsequent requests without having to ask the server repeatedly. In this paper, we present an <b>on-line</b> <b>analytical</b> <b>processing</b> systems caching technique with the ability to identify the exploration patterns of its users, i. e., what queries a user will submit during a working session, their frequency and resources involved, and to predict what data they will request in a near future, as well as the sequence of those requests. To do that in an efficient manner, we need to maintain a positive ratio between the time spent to predict and materialize the most relevant views to users, and the time that would be spent if no prediction had been done. Using association rules and Markov chains techniques, we designed a flexible manner to provide an effective caching system for <b>on-line</b> <b>analytical</b> <b>processing</b> systems...|$|E

The {{technology}} and principle {{involved in the}} <b>on-line</b> <b>analytical</b> <b>processing</b> is presented in theory, such as {{an overview of the}} on-line analytical technology, the operation of the on-line analytical technology, etc, which sets a technological foundation to build a system to realize online analysis. E. F. Codd, the father of the relational database, firstly proposed the concept of <b>on-line</b> <b>analytical</b> <b>processing</b> in 1993. Traditional enterprise database system (management information system), i. e. On-Line Transaction Processing, OLTP in short，is mainly used for Transaction Processing as a means of data management, but its support for analysis and processing has been far from satisfactory. In Codd’s opinion, On-Line Transaction Processing (OLTP) can not meet the requirements of end users on query analysis of the database, and a simple query of the big database with SQL can not meet the needs of users ’ analysis. User’s decision analysis needs to calculate a lot of the relational database to get the results, whereas the results of the query can not {{meet the needs of the}} decision makers. Codd put forward the concept of multidimensional database and multidimensional analysis, namely, <b>On-Line</b> <b>Analytical</b> <b>Processing</b> (OLAP). The OLAP committee defines <b>On-Line</b> <b>Analytical</b> <b>Processing</b> as a type of software technology which can get access to the information immediately, consistently and interactively and can help gain a deeper understanding of the data for the analyst, managers and executives who can transform the original data from various perspectives, make the users understand truly, and really reflect the dimension features of the enterprise. The goal of OLAP is to meet the requirements of decision support or the particular query and report in a multidimensional environment. Its core technology is the concept of "dimension ", therefore OLAP can also be called as a collection of multidimensional data analysis tools...|$|E
