5|$|Along {{with many}} other texts, Gandhi studied Bhagavad Gita while in South Africa. This Hindu scripture {{discusses}} jnana yoga, bhakti yoga and karma yoga along with virtues such as non-violence, patience, integrity, lack <b>of</b> <b>hypocrisy,</b> self restraint and abstinence. Gandhi began experiments with these, and in 1906 at age 37, although married and a father, he vowed to abstain from sexual relations.|$|E
5|$|Although Haynes was a prohibitionist, he was {{a critic}} of the Indiana Branch of the Ku Klux Klan, which was in the height of its power during the 1910s and 1920s. In letters to friends and fellow prohibitionists, he {{ridiculed}} the organization for using violent and illegal tactics to achieve prohibition, and accused them <b>of</b> <b>hypocrisy</b> for supporting many anti-prohibition Democratic politicians. Kokomo politics was dominated by the Klan during that period and it is unknown if Haynes spoke publicly against the organization.|$|E
5|$|Editorials by AlterNet, The Montreal Gazette, The Wall Street Journal, The Guardian, and The New York Times {{have accused}} Wilders <b>of</b> <b>hypocrisy</b> given that, in their view, Wilders {{has called for}} the ban of {{the sale of the}} Quran while {{simultaneously}} arguing for his own personal freedom of speech. In a speech during a Dutch parliamentary debate, Wilders elaborated that he calls for the consistent application of Dutch laws restricting any act of expression that incites violence. Ideally, he would prefer to see nearly all such laws abolished. As such, he supports a European-wide constitutional protection of freedom of speech like that which exists in the United States.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates how {{perceptions}} <b>of</b> corporate <b>hypocrisy</b> {{from the}} Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities connect the public 2 ̆ 7 s ethical philosphy to subsequent positive/negative opinion-sharing intention. With {{special attention to}} deontology and consequentialism in normative ethics of philosophy, the current study empirically tests a theoretical model <b>of</b> perceived corporate <b>hypocrisy</b> with two causal antecedents (i. e., individual moral philosophy of deontology and consequentialism), and the mediating role <b>of</b> corporate <b>hypocrisy</b> between such antecedents and the publics 2 ̆ 7 subsequent communication intention (i. e., positive and negative opinion-sharing intentions) toward a firm.

5|$|The London {{establishment}} that governed the game were {{disturbed by the}} New Zealanders' approach to the game; reports of rough and over-aggressive play by the Natives had steadily increased in frequency since their arrival in Britain. In the north of England, criticism of the visitors' sportsmanship was rarer; the tourists were accepted as playing {{the game in the}} same spirit as their local opponents, which in the north was a more working class sport than in the south. Some of the Natives, including Joe Warbrick, accused the RFU and the English press <b>of</b> <b>hypocrisy,</b> claiming that they were quick to criticise the New Zealanders for rough play, yet tolerant of similar behaviour from their own players.|$|E
5|$|The {{integration}} process repeatedly brought Indian and Pakistani leaders into conflict. During negotiations, Jinnah, representing the Muslim League, strongly supported {{the right of}} the princely states to remain independent, joining neither India nor Pakistan, an attitude which was diametrically opposed to the stance taken by Nehru and the Congress and which was reflected in Pakistan's support of Hyderabad's bid to stay independent. Post-partition, the Government of Pakistan accused India <b>of</b> <b>hypocrisy</b> on the ground that there was little difference between the accession of the ruler of Junagadh to Pakistan—which India refused to recognise—and the accession of the Maharajah of Kashmir to India, and for several years refused to recognise the legality of India's incorporation of Junagadh, treating it as de jure Pakistani territory.|$|E
5|$|For {{some time}} Zwingli had accused mendicant orders <b>of</b> <b>hypocrisy</b> and demanded their {{abolition}} {{in order to}} support the truly poor. He suggested the monasteries be changed into hospitals and welfare institutions and incorporate their wealth into a welfare fund. This was done by reorganising the foundations of the Grossmünster and Fraumünster and pensioning off remaining nuns and monks. The council secularised the church properties (Fraumünster handed over by Zwingli's acquaintance Katharina von Zimmern) and established new welfare programs for the poor. Zwingli requested permission to establish a Latin school, the Prophezei (Prophecy) or Carolinum, at the Grossmünster. The council agreed and it was officially opened on 19 June 1525 with Zwingli and Jud as teachers. It served to retrain and re-educate the clergy. The Zurich Bible translation, traditionally attributed to Zwingli and printed by Christoph Froschauer, bears the mark of teamwork from the Prophecy school. Scholars have not yet attempted to clarify Zwingli's share of the work based on external and stylistic evidence.|$|E

5000|$|The album {{received}} moderately positive reviews, with critics {{noting that}} the album would appeal to the band's fanbase but did not advance Hypocrisy's sound. Chris Dick, writing for Decibel Magazine, criticized End of Disclosure for its [...] "potluck songwriting", which gave {{the impression that the}} album was [...] "cycling through various stages <b>of</b> <b>Hypocrisy's</b> (and the Abyss's) repertoire, giving it a shiny, modern coat of paint and calling it an album". [...] Natalie Zed, writing for About.com, praised the album for the [...] "menace and hostility" [...] of its atmosphere but described it as [...] "an album that revisits familiar themes rather than breaks new ground". Laura Wiebe, writing for Exclaim!, claimed that the album accomplished Peter Tägtgren's intended goal of going [...] "back to basics", but also noted that the album generally [...] "rolled out more like a highlight reel <b>of</b> <b>Hypocrisy's</b> specialties".|$|R

40|$|Literature is an {{expression}} of life through language form. The author is free to use his/her words through his/her imagination in his work, in offering the readers the kinds of description of life that frequently occurs in human life. By reading and analyzing the novel, the reader can feel high-low emotion, learning how to solve a problem, and socialize a foreign culture. This study uses descriptive qualitative, because there is no treatment in this research. This thesis is also conducted by using document analysis technique that implies the analysis of the written or visual contents of document. Dealing with this study, the writer used objective approach because she can analyze without necessarily studying the life of its author, or the age in which it was written, or its possible effect on the readers. The problems that were answered in this study were (1). What are the type <b>of</b> Beatrice’s <b>hypocrisy?,</b> (2). What are the cause <b>of</b> Beatrice’s <b>hypocrisy?,</b> (3). What are the effects <b>of</b> Beatrice’s <b>hypocrisy?</b> The result <b>of</b> this study shows that; the types <b>of</b> Beatrice’s <b>hypocrisy</b> are categorized into: Internal hypocrisy and External hypocrisy. Internal hypocrisy: Beatrice didn’t tell the truth that she could make an affair with Chase, and Beatrice expected that Chase let her to stay, External hypocrisy: Beatrice’s statement contradicted with her actions, and Beatrice didn’t tell the truth about her hair. The causes <b>of</b> Beatrice’s <b>hypocrisy</b> are that Beatrice realized that she was a city girl, and Beatrice has different perception with Chase about living in the outback. The effects <b>of</b> Beatrice’s <b>hypocrisy</b> are: Beatrice decides to make short meaningless relationship with Chase, and Beatrice got married with no commitment and no messy emotions. ...|$|R
