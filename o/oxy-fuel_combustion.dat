For on <b>oxy-fuel</b> based <b>combustion</b> cycle, we have previously evaluated the effect of presence of oxygen, nitrogen and argon on the CO 2 phase diagram and the critical properties of mixtures in these systems. For a 320  km pipeline, we established a base case for pure CO 2, and evaluated the difference in compressor power requirements as each contaminant was added in fixed proportions. The key finding was that if the mixture encountered a two-phase region along the pipeline, the pressure drop becomes punitive. We proposed a minimal adjustment of operating conditions (or the temperature and pressure profile along the pipeline) to avoid the two-phase region and concomitant prohibitive pressure losses. In this paper, we consider the influence of hydrogen sulfide and water on the phase behavior of the CO 2 -rich captured stream. Specifically, we examine the phase equilibria and the PVT properties, and compare the GERG– 2008 equation of state (EoS) computations with experimental data. In general, CO 2 -rich effluent mixtures from oxy-fuel plants may undergo phase separation at higher pressures than that for pure CO 2 for the temperature range likely to be encountered in surface and injection facilities designed for CO 2 sequestration. In addition, density, compressibility, and reactive properties of these mixtures may be significantly different from pure CO 2. Consequently, operation of large geologic CO 2 storage sites must anticipate how these differences in the thermodynamic properties of the injected fluids may affect compressor power requirements, pipeline transport, well design, and wellbore and reservoir integrity...|$|R

Kinetics of EOS and its char oxidation were analyzed in different atmospheres {{in order to understand}} the complex mechanism of oil shale (OS) OF combustion. Additionally, the OF combustion of OS in circulating fluidized bed (CFB) was simulated with the recently released Aspen Plus fluidized bed (FB) reactor which treats bottom zone and freeboard hydrodynamics. Particular attention was given to the determination of the required elutriated mass flows to maintain the heat balance of the system for OF combustion cases. Four case studies were simulated including: Case 1 : Air combustion, Case 2 : 21 %O 2 /flue gas, Case 3 : 23 %O 2 /flue gas and Case 4 : 30 %O 2 /flue gas. The results of TA experiments show that the pyrolysis behavior is very similar in Ar and CO 2 until 500 °C and there is no visible char carbon and CO 2 reaction under OF conditions. The emissions of CO 2 from mineral part of OS can be diminished as decomposition of calcite takes place at higher temperatures in OF combustion. Activation energies calculated for oxidation of OS and its char in CO 2 /O 2 are notably less than activation energies calculated for Ar/O 2 atmosphere. Modeling results show that higher fuel mass flow rate and higher O 2 concentration in the oxidizer have to be considered in the set of conditions for OF in order to extract the same amount of heat as in air combustion. The Case 3 with 23 % inlet O 2 concentration has a similar behavior as compared to air combustion in terms of temperature of the boiler and recirculation rate of the particles. The data obtained from experimental measurements and models is valuable for the possible implementation of OF combustion of EOS in CFB boilers...|$|R
40|$|The {{oxy-fuel}} {{process is}} one of three carbon capture technologies which supply CO₂ ready for sequestration – the others being post-combustion capture and IGCC with carbon capture. As yet no technology has emerged as a clear winner in the race to commercial deployment. The oxy-fuel process relies on recycled flue gas as the main heat carrier through the boiler and results in significantly different flue gas compositions. Sulphur has been shown in the study to have impacts in the furnace, during ash collection, CO₂ compression and transport as well as storage, with many options for its removal or impact control. In particular, the effect of sulphur containing species can pose a risk for corrosion throughout the plant and transport pipelines.

40|$|Carbon {{capture and}} storage (CCS) {{can play a}} {{significant}} role in the attempt to mitigate climate change. Among the technologies today available for CO 2 capture, calcium looping exploits the reaction that takes place at medium temperatures between lime (CaO) and CO 2 to form limestone (CaCO 3) which can be reversed at higher temperatures to release pure CO 2. The process is based on well-known technology but its application for CO 2 capture has been suggested only recently and is less established than other CO 2 capture technologies such as chemical absorption using amines or ammonia as solvents. A reason for this is that fuel is needed to provide high temperature heat. Thus carbon capture by calcium looping can represent a competitive solution where fuel is available in large quantities like in coal power plants. In addition, since a certain quantity of spent sorbent is obtained from the calcium looping, an interesting application arises when this spent lime can be further used for other purposes. This is the case of the cement industry where lime from the calcium looping can reduce the demand of fresh limestone and the energy consumption for its calcination into lime. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the process integration opportunities of carbon capture by the calcium looping technology mainly from a thermodynamic point of view and for the two most relevant application cases: coal power plant and cement industry. Pinch analysis is used as a tool for estimating the consequences of calcium looping application on the process heat and power balances under ideal heat recovery conditions. For this purpose, process modelling and simulation is conducted to obtain temperature and heat load information of the different system parts. The work is organised in two parts discussing the integration aspects of calcium looping with a state of the art coal power plant and a combined power and cement production plant respectively. Three configurations are considered for integration of calcium looping with the coal power plant: two cases assuming a separate steam cycle to recover the excess heat from the calcium looping process (each case with different complexity of the steam cycle) and one case where heat from the coal plant and calcium looping process are recovered and used in the same steam cycle. To assess the integration effect of carbon capture the penalty on the power plant thermal efficiency is used as an indicator. For comparison <b>oxy-fuel</b> coal <b>combustion</b> technology and subsequent CO 2 separation by water condensation is also investigated. The case where calcium looping and the coal power plant are integrated with the same steam cycle achieves the best result in terms of electrical efficiency, with a penalty of 5. 3 %-points compared to a reference coal plant without calcium looping (from 42. 8 % to 37. 5 %). The analysis of integration between coal power plant, cement production plant and calcium looping is conducted considering two cases: the first where the cement plant output is kept equal to the reference plant, and the second where the cement output is adjusted to completely replace the limestone input with the spent sorbent from the calcium looping. The integration effects are assessed considering different indicators, such as the thermal efficiency penalty with respect the reference power plant, the specific fuel consumption for cement production, the reduction in specific GHG-emissions from the combined cement and power production. In the case of limestone free cement production the further integration of cement production with coal power plant and calcium looping contributes to a minor reduction in thermal efficiency (from 37. 5 % to 37. 3 %) ...|$|R

In 1923, Winkler's coal gasifier represented {{the first significant}} large-scale use of fluidized bed [...] (Kunii and Levenspiel, 1991). Nowadays, the world's largest CFB unit is operating since 2009 at Lagisza, Poland, 460 MW supercritical CFB, Foster and Wheeler. Even though the cheap liquid and gaseous fuels have decelerated the coal and solid fuels R&D.; many sectors increasingly use CFB viz. electricity generation and industrial sectors, because of the CFB's advantages. The 1970th cries reactivated the interest to the solid fuel and coal again. Moreover, the increasing concern of GHGs, cheap cost of coal and its abundant sources motivate again the researches of CFB (IEA-CIAB, 2013). The CCS was considered as an important technology to mitigate GHGs. To apply CCS, novel techniques viz. pre-combustion, post-combustion, and oxy-combustion are raised.

50|$|The glass {{industry}} has been converting to oxy-fuel since the early 1990s because glass furnaces require a temperature of approximately 2800 degrees F, which is not attainable at adiabatic flame temperatures for air-fuel combustion unless heat is regenerated between the flue stream and the incoming air stream. Historically, glass furnace regenerators were large and expensive high temperature brick ducts filled with brick arranged in a checkerboard pattern to capture heat as flue gas exits the furnace. When the flue duct is thoroughly heated, air flow is reversed and the flue duct becomes the air inlet, releasing its heat into the incoming air, and allowing for higher furnace temperatures than can be attained with air-fuel only. Two sets of regenerative flue ducts allowed for the air flow to be reversed at regular intervals, and thus maintain a high temperature in the incoming air. By allowing new furnaces to be built without the expense of regenerators, and especially with {{the added benefit of}} nitrogen oxide reduction, which allows glass plants to meet emission restrictions, oxy-fuel is cost effective without the need to reduce CO2 emissions. <b>Oxy-fuel</b> <b>combustion</b> also reduces CO2 release at the glass plant location, although this may be offset by CO2 production due to electric power generation which is necessary to produce oxygen for the combustion process.|$|E
50|$|Carbon dioxide {{is a major}} {{greenhouse}} gas that contributes to climate change, and its levels have increased from human activity, promoting incidents such as fossil fuel combustion. One of the main technologies meant for reducing carbon dioxide emissions is carbon capture storage (CCS).

First, the technology separates the carbon dioxide from the gases produced in the electricity generation or industrial processes in methods of  pre-combustion captures, post combustion capture, or <b>oxy-fuel</b> <b>combustion.</b> Then, the separated carbon dioxide is transported for safe storage via either pipeline or ship. The carbon dioxide is stored carefully in depleted natural gas fields or selected geologic rock formations underground, that are usually located a few kilometres underneath the earth’s surface.
