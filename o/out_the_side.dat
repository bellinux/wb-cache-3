He made his Cubs debut on July 24, 2016 against the Milwaukee Brewers, pitching one inning and striking <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> while allowing one hit and one walk. After three appearances, the Cubs designated Nathan for assignment on August 6, 2016.|$|E
5|$|As sensor coils {{are placed}} on the tongue of the subject, {{articulation}} may be affected depending on {{the placement of the}} coils, but no comparative analysis has shown whether articulation is altered because of the coils. The coils are about 3mm in size and are not considered to be a particularly large source of error for measurements. Some researchers have found that subjects are irritated by sensor coils placed on the tip of the tongue which can lead to disturbed articulation. Similarly, the wires attached to the sensor coils can inhibit articulation if not run <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Before the 2006 season began, Nathan {{participated in}} the 2006 World Baseball Classic {{as one of the}} 30 players {{selected}} for the Team USA roster. He played the first game, a 2–0 win against Mexico, striking <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> while allowing one hit. He also pitched the 4–3 victory against Japan, again throwing a shutout inning. Nathan went on to pitch the last game for the United States in the ninth inning against Mexico, again not allowing a run and striking out two.|$|E

As Sol escapes to his car, a cloaked figure attacks him; Sol is killed when the figure causes him to drive <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of a parking garage and into a neighboring building. Batman arrives soon after, and bystanders blame him for Sol's death. Councilman Arthur Reeves tells the media that Batman is a menace (despite Commissioner Gordon's protests).

This would have blown <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the ship, destroying the girder strength of the hull; the force of water entering the hole, at a speed of nearly , would then shear the stern section {{from the rest of}} the hull.|$|E
5|$|Richard {{made his}} next start, after five days rest, against the Cincinnati Reds, {{who would later}} finish the NL West season in a tie for fourth place with the Astros. Richard gave up a lead-off home run to Pete Rose {{in the first inning}} and pitched five innings of the two-hit, one-run game. He struck out five batters but walked six. Richard {{struggled}} in his two following starts. In a September 16 match-up against the Astros' division rival, the third-place Atlanta Braves, Richard pitched seven innings and surrendered four runs on seven hits. He struck out nine batters and even struck <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> in the first inning but also walked four batters. Furthermore, he threw two wild pitches in the first and fifth innings. In his final game of the season, against the Giants, Richard was replaced in the first inning after pitching to only four batters.|$|E

5|$|After {{finishing}} the 2010 season strong, the Dodgers named Kershaw as the Opening Day Starter for the 2011 season. On May 29, he pitched the second complete-game shutout of his career, striking out 10 while winning a two-hitter against the Florida Marlins, 8–0; {{he also had}} two singles and an RBI, scoring twice in the game. He produced his third career shutout on June 20, a two-hit, 11-strikeout effort against the Detroit Tigers. Kershaw became the first Dodgers starter to strike <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> in the 9th inning since Sandy Koufax's perfect game. In his next start, on June 26, Kershaw pitched another complete game (against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim). He became the first Dodger starter to have back-to-back complete game victories since Jeff Weaver in the 2005 season and the first Dodger to have double-digit strikeouts in consecutive starts since Chan-Ho Park in the 2000 season. He was awarded the National League Player of the Week award for the week of June 20–26 {{as a result of}} those two starts. Midway through June, Kershaw had amassed 32 career victories, a 3.15 ERA and 593 career strikeouts in 568.2 innings. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Kershaw was the first 23-year-old pitcher to have that many victories, an ERA that low and an average of more than one strikeout per inning since ERA became an official statistic in 1910.|$|E

A few years later Wes' brother Jim was flying a Sikorsky S-61 in the Colorado Rockies. Jim was so cold he was forced to land.

25|$|Paige first {{played for}} the semi-{{professional}} Mobile Tigers from 1924 to 1926. He began his professional baseball career in 1926 with the Chattanooga Black Lookouts of the Negro Southern League {{and became one of}} the most famous and successful players from the Negro leagues. While his outstanding control as a pitcher first got him noticed, it was his infectious, cocky, enthusiastic personality and his love for the game that made him a star. On town tours across the United States, Paige would sometimes have his infielders sit down behind him and then routinely strike <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>side.</b> He played his last professional game on June 21, 1966, for the Peninsula Grays of the Carolina League.|$|E

It {{was the first time}} any pitcher struck <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> to start an All-Star Game, and the performance earned Martínez the All-Star Game MVP award. Martínez later said that the 1999 All-Star break was especially memorable for him because he was able to meet the members of the MLB All-Century Team and get an autograph from Ted Williams.|$|E
25|$|Tanaka {{was highly}} {{expected}} to be the staff ace of Team Japan in the 2013 WBC, but poor form in the build-up to the tournament led to concern over his performance. He started the pool opener against Brazil and conceded an unearned run. He came on as a reliever against Cuba and again conceded a run, before appearing to return to his usual form by striking out 6 batters in 2 innings. Tanaka again came on as a reliever against Chinese Taipei and had 2 good innings, shutting <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> with 4 strike outs, before conceding the equalizer in his third inning {{at the bottom of the}} 8th. Up to that point, Tanaka's inconsistency produced an ERA of 3.00, allowing 10 hits and 3 runs (2 earned) in 6 innings while striking out 10.|$|E

After playing further matches for a North Zone schools side in the underage Cooch Behar Trophy, Benjamin made his first-class debut in October 1973, taking two wickets for a Vazir Sultan Tobacco Colts XI against a Hyderabad Cricket Association XI in the quarter-final of the Moin-ud-Dowlah Gold Cup Tournament. A bowling all-rounder, he debuted for Punjab later that month, taking 5/37 on debut against Jammu and Kashmir, and was a regular in Ranji Trophy teams through to the 1977–78 season.

25|$|Chelsea {{competed with}} Tottenham Hotspur {{in the first}} all-London FA Cup final, known as the Cockney Cup Final.

In leading <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>side,</b> Ron Harris, at 22, was the youngest ever captain {{to take to the}} field in the competition's finale. In a game which failed to match the anticipation, Chelsea underperformed and a late Tambling header was not enough to prevent a 2–1 loss to a Spurs side containing both Venables and Jimmy Greaves. Docherty was sacked shortly into the next season with the team having won only two of their opening ten games, which included a 6–2 home loss to Southampton, amidst rumours of dressing room unrest over bonus payments and whilst serving a 28-day ban from football management handed out by the FA.|$|E

It {{was a different story}} in game two, however, as Ball State took a lead in the first inning and did not relinquish it. Geoffrey Davenport would continue after the shaky start to pitch effectively for four innings, including striking <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> in the fourth. The Razorbacks left twelve runners on base, and committed four defensive errors. Game three was initially delayed fifteen minutes due to rain, but once the game started, Brett Eibner and Drew Smyly pitched well. Designated hitter Monk Kreder, a junior college transfer native to Keller, Texas, collected three hits. Six different Razorbacks scored in the 9–3 victory.|$|E
