40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{identify}} and quantify several sensory active compounds in various types <b>of</b> <b>yogurts</b> using gas chromatography and simultaneously to judge their influence on flavour <b>of</b> <b>yogurts</b> using sensory analysis. In total 4 types of white and 10 types <b>of</b> flavoured <b>yogurts</b> (creamy and low-fat) with various flavourings, produced in Dairy Valašské Meziříčí, Ltd., were analysed. The highest content of sensory active compounds (P < 0. 05) was found in strawberry yogurts, with high amount of ethyl butyrate. Excepting ethanol no significant differences (P < 0. 05) were found between low-fat and creamy varieties. The total content of sensory active compounds in white yogurts was significantly (P < 0. 05) lower than in flavoured fruit types. The highest content was in low-fat and lowest in white bio yoghurts. Flavour <b>of</b> <b>yogurts</b> was evaluated sensorially using scale and ranking test. All creamy yogurt varieties were evaluated as significantly (P < 0. 05) more tasty than low-fat ones. Similarly in case <b>of</b> white <b>yogurts</b> creamy yogurts were evaluated as the most tasty and low-fat ones as the worst. Bio yogurts were evaluated equally tasty as classic yogurts with the same fat content...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Quinoa {{can be used}} as a {{functional}} ingredient in food formulations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects on proximate composition, stability during storage, texture and consumer acceptability <b>of</b> <b>yogurts</b> supplemented with quinoa flour at 1, 3 and 5 g 100 mL- 1. A product without supplementation was used as control. Products were assessed for moisture, carbohydrates, proteins, fats, total dietary fibre (TDF), ashes and minerals. The pH, acidity and syneresis <b>of</b> <b>yogurts</b> were measured after 1, 7, 14 and 21 days of storage and a Texture Profile Analysis (TPA) was carried out. Applying hedonic scale, 102 consumers analyzed the overall acceptability, color, texture, flavor and aroma <b>of</b> <b>yogurts.</b> Supplemented products showed significant higher protein, carbohydrate and fat contents. Hardness and adhesiveness showed a negative association whereas a positive one was found between springiness and cohesiveness. Yogurt is not necessarily the adequate matrix for hauling quinoa compounds since the addition of greater amounts of 1 g 100 mL- 1 quinoa flour had undesirable effects on gel stability (syneresis and increases in total acidity) and consumer acceptability...|$|R

40|$|Lactic acid {{fermentation}} {{during the}} production of skim milk and whole fat set-style yogurt was continuously monitored by measuring pH. The modified Gompertz model was successfully applied to describe the pH decline and viscosity development during the fermentation process. The viscosity and incubation time data were also fitted to linear models against ln(pH). The investigation <b>of</b> the <b>yogurt</b> quality improvement practices included 2 different heat treatments (80 °C for 30 min and 95 °C for 10 min), 3 milk protein fortifying agents (skim milk powder, whey powder, and milk protein concentrate) added at 2. 0 %, and 4 hydrocolloids (κ-carrageenan, xanthan, guar gum, and pectin) added at 0. 01 % to whole fat and skim yogurts. Heat treatment significantly affected viscosity and acetaldehyde development without influencing incubation time and acidity. The addition of whey powder shortened the incubation time but had a detrimental effect on consistency, firmness, and overall acceptance <b>of</b> <b>yogurts.</b> On the other hand, addition of skim milk powder improved the textural quality and decreased the vulnerability <b>of</b> <b>yogurts</b> to syneresis. Anionic stabilizers (κ-carrageenan and pectin) had a poor effect on the texture and palatability <b>of</b> <b>yogurts.</b> However, neutral gums (xanthan and guar gum) improved texture and prevented the wheying-off defect. Skim milk yogurts exhibited longer incubation times and higher viscosities, whereas they were rated higher during sensory evaluation than whole fat yogurts. © American Dairy Science Association, 2007...|$|R
40|$|Effects of casein hydrolysates by papain on {{acidification}} <b>of</b> the <b>yogurts</b> {{and growth}} <b>of</b> probiotic bacteria during yogurt fermentation have been investigated. The viability of probiotic bacteria and texture characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>yogurts</b> during storage at 4 °C have been evaluated.

25|$|Until the 1900s, yogurt was {{a staple}} in diets {{of people in the}} Russian Empire (and {{especially}} Central Asia and the Caucasus), Western Asia, South Eastern Europe/Balkans, Central Europe, and India. Stamen Grigorov (1878–1945), a Bulgarian student of medicine in Geneva, first examined the microflora of the Bulgarian yogurt. In 1905, he described it as consisting of a spherical and a rod-like lactic acid-producing bacteria. In 1907, the rod-like bacterium was called Bacillus bulgaricus (now Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus). The Russian Nobel laureate and biologist Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov, from the Institut Pasteur in Paris, was influenced by Grigorov's work and hypothesized that regular consumption <b>of</b> <b>yogurt</b> was responsible for the unusually long lifespans of Bulgarian peasants. Believing Lactobacillus to be essential for good health, Mechnikov worked to popularize yogurt as a foodstuff throughout Europe.|$|E
25|$|Da-hi is a yogurt of the Indian subcontinent, {{known for}} its {{characteristic}} taste and consistency. The word da-hi seems {{to be derived from}} the Sanskrit word dadhi, one of the five elixirs, or panchamrita, often used in Hindu ritual. Dahi also holds cultural symbolism in many homes in the Mithila region of Nepal and Bihar. Yogurt balances the palate across regional cuisines throughout India. In the hot and humid south, yogurt and foods made <b>of</b> <b>yogurt</b> are a staple in order to cool down – yogurt rice is always the last dish of the meal. Also, the vegetarian population of India derives some protein from yogurt (other than lentil and beans). Sweet yogurt (meesti doi or meethi dahi) is common in eastern parts of India, made by fermenting sweetened milk. While cow's milk is considered sacred and is currently the primary ingredient for yogurt, goat and buffalo milk were widely used in the past, and valued for the fat content (see buffalo curd). Butter and cream were made by churning the yogurt/milk.|$|E
25|$|A much milder acid than tartaric and malic, {{lactic acid}} is often {{associated}} with “milky” flavors in wine and is the primary acid <b>of</b> <b>yogurt</b> and sauerkraut. It is produced during winemaking by lactic acid bacteria (LAB), which includes three genera: Oenococcus, Pediococcus and Lactobacillus. These bacteria convert both sugar and malic acid into lactic acid, the latter through MLF. This process can be beneficial for some wines, adding complexity and softening the harshness of malic acidity, but it can generate off flavors and turbidity in others. Some strains of LAB can produce biogenic amines, such as histamine, tyramine and putrescine, which may be a cause of red wine headaches in some wine drinkers. Winemakers wishing to control or prevent MLF can use sulfur dioxide to stun the bacteria. Racking the wine quickly off its lees will also help control the bacteria, since lees are a vital food source for them. The winemakers must also be very careful of what wine barrels and winemaking equipment to which the wine is exposed, because of the bacteria's ability to deeply embed themselves within wood fibers. A wine barrel that has completed one successful malolactic fermentation will almost always induce MLF in every wine stored in it from then on.|$|E

40|$|Yogurts {{were made}} from intermediate-high {{temperature}} (100, 110, 120, and 130 °C for 4 or 16 s), ultra-high temperature (140 °C for 4 or 16 s), and vat heat (82 °C for 20 min) treatments of skim milk fortified to 5 % protein by either ultrafiltration or the addition of nonfat dry milk (NOM). Whey protein denaturation in heated milks increased with temperature and holding time from indirect plate heating and was highest in vat-heated milks. Whey protein denaturation and yogurt water-holding capacity increased with protein levels in the fortified milks compared to skim milk. Penetrometer gel strength and stirred viscosity in 21 day-old yogurt made from heated ultrafiltered skim milk exceeded those <b>of</b> <b>yogurts</b> made from NOM-fortified skim milk, even though the NOM yogurts contained more solids (13. 0 vs 11. 4 %). Maximum gel strength and viscosity, and least syneresis <b>of</b> <b>yogurts</b> from ultrafiltered and NOM fortified yogurts occurred following intermediate-high temperature treatments of 1 00 °C for 16 s, 110 °C for 4 or 16 s, and 120 °C for 4 s. There was significantly lower whey protein denaturation at these intermediate-high temperatures compared to UHT or vat heating. Gel strength and viscosity were lower and syneresis greater in yogurts from ultrafiltered or NOM-fortified skim milk following UHT treatment compared to yogurts made with intermediate-high temperature treatments or vat heating. The water-holding capacity <b>of</b> <b>yogurts</b> from fortified milks treated at intermediate-high temperatures was comparable to that <b>of</b> <b>yogurts</b> from vatheated milks.
