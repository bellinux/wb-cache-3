50|$|Naloxone is an μ-opioid {{receptor}} antagonist which, in mammals, negates the analgesic {{effects of}} opioids. Both adult and 5-day old zebrafish larvae show behavioural responses indicative {{of pain in}} response to injected or diluted acetic acid. The anti-nociceptive properties of morphine or buprenorphine are reversed if adults, or larvae, are co-treated with naloxone. Both naloxone and prolyl-leucyl-glycinamide (another <b>opiate</b> <b>antagonist</b> in mammals) reduced the analgesic effects of morphine to electric shocks received by goldfish, indicating they can act as an <b>opiate</b> <b>antagonist</b> in fish.|$|E

5000|$|In {{studies that}} stimulate {{seizures}} by subjecting rats to electroshock, seizures {{are followed by}} unconsciousness and slow waves on an electroencephalogram (EEG), signs of postictal catalepsy. Administering the <b>opiate</b> <b>antagonist</b> naloxone immediately reverses this state, providing evidence that increased responsiveness or concentration of the opiate receptors may be occurring during seizures and may be partially responsible for the weariness humans experience following a seizure. When humans were given naloxone in-between seizures, researchers observed increased activity on their EEGs, suggesting that opioid receptors may also be upregulated during human seizures. [...] To provide direct evidence for this, Hammers et al. did positron emission tomography (PET) scanning of radiolabelled ligands before, during, and after spontaneous seizures in humans. They found that opioid receptors were upregulated in the regions near {{the focus of the}} seizure during the ictal phase, gradually returning to baseline availability during the postictal phase. [...] Hammers notes that cerebral bloodflow after a seizure can not account for the increase in PET activity observed. Regional bloodflow can increase by as much as 70-80% after seizures but normalizes after 30 minutes. The shortest postictal interval in their study was 90 minutes and none of the patients had seizures during the scanning. It has been predicted that a decrease in opioid activity following a seizure could cause withdrawal symptoms, contributing to postictal depression. The opioid receptor connection with mitigating seizures has been disputed, and opioids have been found to have different functions in different regions of the brain, having both proconvulsive and anticonvulsive effects.|$|E

40|$|Summary-Chronic {{administration}} of lithium suppressed the jumping response of saline treated mice {{in the hot}} plate test but {{had no effect on}} rearing and grooming behaviour. Naloxone (0. 15640 mg/kg) or naltrexone (0. 15640 mg/kg) elevated by up to 130 ”,/, the frequency of the jumping response of mice fed with lithium but had little effect on the control animals. The same treatment with the <b>opiate</b> <b>antagonists</b> decreased, in a dose-dependent fashion, the rearing and grooming episodes. Large doses of naltrexone suppressed the jumping response of both normal mice and mice fed with lithium. Mice fed for 5 - 40 days with lithium showed a complete development of the increased jumping response to naloxone within 10 days. and somewhat less pronounced response after 40 days. Lithium levels in brain also reached a maximum after 10 days of lithium feeding. The increased in uiuo sensitivity to <b>opiate</b> <b>antagonists</b> of lithium-treated mice was not reflected by changes in either the affinity or the total number of opiate receptors as tested by the binding of [3 H]na 10 xone to crude membrane preparations of whole brain.

40|$|The {{possible}} role of endogenous opioids in {{the central}} adrenergic control of blood pressure and heart rate was studied in different strains of hypertensive and normotensive rats. In spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) the hypotension and bradycardia resulting from stimulation of central (alpha) -adrenoceptors by clonidine or (alpha) -methyldopa are inhibited by the <b>opiate</b> <b>antagonists</b> naloxone and naltrexone and by centrally administered (beta) -endorphin antibody. Clonidine and 1 -(alpha) -methylnoradrenaline increase the release of immunoreactive (beta) -endorphin from brain stem slices of SHR, superfused in vitro. The antihypertensive effects of clonidine and (alpha) -methyldopa are similarly inhibited by <b>opiate</b> <b>antagonists</b> in steroid/salt and renal hypertensive, Sprague-Dawley rats, but not in matched normotensive controls for the above three groups of animals. Furthermore, in SHR the centrally mediated acute {{as well as the}} chronic antihypertensive action of propranolol is prevented or reversed by naloxone and naltrexone, whereas the hypotensive response to baroreflex activation or to direct electrical stimulation of the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) is not inhibited and the bradycardia is potentiated by naltrexone. These findings indicate that the mechanism of action of antihypertensive drugs that act through stimulation (alpha) (, 2) -adrenoceptors {{in the central}} nervous system involves the release of an endorphin-like opioid from the brainstem and subsequent stimulation of opiate receptors inhibitory to sympathetic tone. The exact central site of this interaction is not known, but in SHR it does not appear to involve the NTS or another component of the baroreflex arc.

None showed any improve-ment in assessments of day-to-day living skills or on a battery of neuropsychological tests. No side effects were noted. In the dosage used, naltrexone appears not to be useful in Alzheimer-type dementia. Research on senile dementia of the Alzheimer type has uncovered defects in the noradrenergic, cholinergic, and somatostatinergic transmitter sys-tems but {{the cause of the}} disease remains unknown, ' 4 and there is no effective treatment. Nonetheless, trials with cholinergic precursors and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have resulted in some improvement and suggested that pharmacological intervention might be beneficial. 5 Opiate antagonists can influence attention and memory and it has been hypothesised that they may be useful in Alzheimer-type dementia. 6 Two reports described improvement in some patients with this disorder following intravenous administration of naloxone, a short-acting <b>opiate</b> <b>antagonist.</b> 78 The results of subsequent trials, however, were disap-pointing. 9 10 Possible causes for the failure of nalox-one might include the short half-life of the substance (less than one hour) and the fact that intravenous administration will not maintain a continuous high blood level and a sustained opioid blockade.

Blockade of opiate receptors by administration of the opiate antagonists naloxone (1. O mg/kg) or naltrexone (1.

Whereas the treatment of the withdrawal syndrome with pharmacological agents such as the benzodiazepines is now an established practice, the use of drugs for other dimensions of the disease is more controversial.
