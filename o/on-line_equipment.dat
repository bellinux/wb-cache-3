The cooling power is 400 μW at 100 mK and 34 μW at 25 mK. The base temperature can be kept continuously well below 5 mK. NMR/ON can be performed at temperatures below 5. 5 mK. The base temperature on-line is expected to be lower then 6 mK. The sample can be cooled down from room temperature to 10 mK within two hours, to 6 mK within 3 hours which is not only important for off-line but also for on-line experiments when samples have to be changed to remove long lived daughter activity.

The half-lives in these decay chains are {{of the order of}} seconds and therefore comparable to the spin-lattice relaxation times of the nuclei in iron. As the relaxation rate depends strongly on the g-factor, g-factors of nuclei in the decay chains can be deduced from the observation of the time evolution of γ-ray anisotropy. Using this technique the existence of an isomer in 184 Au has been found and the g-factors of 184 Au, 184 mAu and 182 Au have been determined. Accurate half-lives have been extracted from the data. Time-integral nuclear orientation has been observed for short lived as well as longer lived isotopes of the Hg decay chains. From these measurements, after proper correction for incomplete relaxation, the magnetic moments of 183 mPt, 183 Ir and 182 Ir have been derived.

40|$|Large {{benefits}} to manufactures—on {{the order of}} 3 - 5 % of the total energy bill—can be realized through optimization of the utility plant operation, improving the economic performance of these cost centers [1]. As new limits on CO and NOx emissions go into effect in the US, major manufacturing companies {{are looking for ways}} to meet those constraints at the lowest possible cost. While capital projects to install more low-NOx equipment are always an option, many companies are looking for better ways to operate their existing utility plants within the EPA guidelines. Even when the equipment is available to operate well below the limits, operators are often faced with many economic decisions that must be made on a day-to-day basis, often without the proper tools to evaluate the tradeoffs. This is especially true as the utility market becomes more deregulated and electricity prices start changing on an hourly or more frequent basis. And the option to buy or sell NOx credits further complicates the picture.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} effects of the origin, occurrence, monitoring, control, fate and removal of {{siloxanes}} on the energetic valorization of sewage biogas, which can be severely compromised by its volatile organic silicon compound (VOSiC) content. Almost 25 years after identifying silicon dioxide in the exhaust gases from engines powered using sewage and landfill gas, a wide range of studies have been conducted addressing the different stages of the siloxane life cycle. The cycle starts with the production and use of polydimethylsiloxane polymers {{in a wide range of}} industrial and domestic applications and its further dispersal into environmental compartments. Siloxanes are subsequently introduced into wastewater treatment plants, where as a result of their low biodegradability and high affinity to dissolved and particulate matter, they are first transferred from wastewater into sludge and later volatilized in biogas in anaerobic digesters. Biogas treatment technologies can reduce siloxane concentrations to less than 0. 1 mg/m 3; adsorbent materials with micro- and mesoporous structures appear to be the most relevant technology in technical and economic terms. The state-of-the-art on siloxanes is vast and extensive, but there are still some knowledge gaps to be addressed in the future, such as the standardization of the methodology for off-line analysis, the development of <b>on-line</b> monitoring <b>equipment,</b> better understanding the fates of siloxanes in wastewater treatment processes to operate at specific conditions to avoid siloxanes-related problems, the development of more selective and regenerative removal technologies from biogas to reduce operating costs and even to recover silicon, and better understand the detrimental effects on energy recovery technologies to determine the inlet concentration limits.

40|$|For <b>on-line</b> plant {{monitoring}} <b>equipment</b> to be functional {{in commercial}} glasshouse horticulture, relations between sensor readings and plant responses {{on both the}} short (days) and long term (weeks) are required. For this reason, systems were installed to monitor rockwool grown gerbera plants on a minute-to-minute basis from July 2002 until April 2003. Data collected included, amongst others, crop transpiration from lysimeter data (2 m 2), canopy temperature using infrared sensors, rockwool water content, and greenhouse climatic parameters, such as global radiation and temperature. By combining data from lysimeter and water content, changes in crop fresh weight could be calculated on a daily basis. Both transpiration and daily fresh weight production were better related to light integral as measured inside the greenhouse, than outside the greenhouse. The contribution of heating pipes underneath the canopy to transpiration could be estimated with the system. From the relation between daily FW production and previous day light integral, a light use efficiency of ca. 10 -g FW/MJ solar radiation as measured inside the greenhouse was calculated. Water use efficiency was on average 25 g FW/L. A 3 - 4 day drying cycle did not affect flower production.

This difference amounts to an error of 0. 7 per cent in heat rate. It is therefore evident that secondary effects must be accounted for in this case. The application technique outlined in this paper is amenable to either manual or automated implementation.

40|$|Though MIG welding robots are {{extensively}} {{applied in}} the automotive assemblies ‘Spot Welding’ {{is the most common}} welding application found in the auto stamping assembly manufacturing. Every manufacturing process is subject to variations – with resistance welding, these include; part fit up, part thickness variations, misaligned electrodes, variations in coating materials or thickness, sealers, weld force variations, shunting, machine tooling degradation; and slag and spatter damage. All welding gun tips undergo wear; an elemental part of the process. Though adaptive resistance welding control automatically compensates to keep production and quality up to the levels needed as gun tips undergo wear so that the welds remain reliable; the system cannot compensate for deterioration caused by the slag and spatter on the part holding fixtures, sensors, and gun tips. To cleanse welding robots of slag and spatter, dry-ice blasting has proven to be an effective remedy. Presently, CO 2 / dry ice blasting is being effectively used in a wide array of applications from heavy slag removal to delicate semiconductor and circuit board cleaning. This process can be used <b>on-line</b> without damaging <b>equipment</b> or requiring a machine "teardown".

40|$|The Sun {{was one of}} {{the central}} points for {{observations}} as long as human cultures are known. After researchers observed the extension of the solar rainbow spectrum towards shorter wavelengths with increasing altitude they started measurements of the solar ultraviolet spectrum from balloons in 1934. The acquisition of spectra in the extreme ultraviolet and soft X-ray spectral regions was beginning after 1946 using photographic recordings aboard rockets. However, it took six more years to achieve good spectral resolution below about 220 nm because servomechanisms had to be developed to fairly accurately point the spectrographs to the Sun during the rocket flight. Another big step forward was achieved by the application of photoelectric recording technology and by using satellites as a platfor m to observe qualitatively the strong variability of the solar ultraviolet irradiance on short-, medium-and long-term scales. Until the end of the past century these measurements have been strongly impeded by the inherent degradation of the EUV instruments with time. Since there is progress solving this serious problem, measurements with sufficient radiometric accuracy allow composing the data available to the first set of ultraviolet data covering a period of eleven years. Based on the sophisticated instrumentation verified in space, future EUV measurements of the solar spectral irradiance on the International Space Station are promising accuracy levels of about 5 %.

40|$|The {{performance}} {{correction of}} {{systems that have}} many thermally integrated components is complex and subject to error if individual component misperformance and/or deterioration is present. The performance correction involves a set of equations or curves which relate the expected changes in dependent performance parameters (i. e. output, fuel consumption, etc.) {{to changes in the}} dependent parameters defining a standard condition (i. e. ambient temperatures, pressure, fuel composition, etc.). These relations and curves are usually generated by vendor performance programs which reflect the design data of the given plant components. However, such relations and curves applied to the overall correction of thermally integrated components can introduce significant correction error if the equipment performance differs from the expected design values. This can be particularly important in acceptance testing and base line monitoring of older plants where performance deterioration has occurred. The performance testing or monitoring of power plants requires that results be corrected to a given reference or standard condition. This correction procedure may be used in various applications, including determining compliance to a guarantee that is specified to a given reference, to compare different plants under similar operating conditions, and/or to track the performance of a given plant with time on a consistent basis. A Measured Performance Signature (MPS) approach has been developed to improve integrated system performance corrections. This procedure is useful for acceptance testing and continuous performance monitoring of industrial cogeneration plants or any energy system. The plant performance signature, is determined from on-line measurements, and corrected to a specified reference. This procedure provides information for adaptive <b>on-line</b> optimum dispatch, <b>equipment</b> performance monitoring, or for conducting system "what if' scenarios.

40|$|HF (hydrogen fluoride) {{emission}} control {{is one of}} the critical environmental parameters in the firing of ceramic materials at peak temperatures higher than 1000 °C. In this study, in-stack concentrations of HF were monitored <b>on-line</b> with laser-based <b>equipment</b> during the fast firing of ceramic tiles in continuous industrial roller hearth kilns under standard kiln operating conditions. Three different ceramic tile compositions: porous red-body wall tiles, red-body stoneware tiles, and porcelain tiles were fired in industrial kilns customarily used to manufacture these types of tiles, modifying the heating rate and tile dry bulk density. The in-stack concentrations of HF can be explained on the basis of tile HF adsorption and emission processes in the kiln preheating and firing zones, analysed in previous studies. The methodology used in this study has significant advantages for industrial studies compared with previous methodologies based primarily on laboratory-scale studies and analysis of solid material. The main advantages are: (a) rapid response, allowing abrupt changes in the HF emission to be studied; and (b) direct measurement of the in-stack concentration of HF, which is the most common parameter used as a legal limit for industrial {{emission control}}. The study shows that tile HF adsorption in the preheating zone is very important. It also shows that HF stack emissions can vary significantly in continuous kilns depending on whether glazed or unglazed tiles are produced, or important changes occur in production (such as gaps in the kiln feed). The results indicate, furthermore, that HF stack emissions do not decrease significantly when realistic changes are made in industrial operating conditions if these industrial kilns are run at peak temperatures above 1100 °C. The most important reduction in in-stack concentrations of HF is observed when glazed ceramic tiles are fired, so further research in this field can be made in order to reduce HF emissions. © 2009 Elsevier B.

40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{evaluate}} the feasibility of implementing Process analytical Technology (PAT) into pharmaceutical manufacturing. First of all the implementation of PAT was looked at from a bird perspective, taking all unit operations into account. This task was divided into two parts, the first one developing a PAT strategy {{that could result in}} a real time release in tablet manufacturing for one product, identifying the critical variables in the manufacturing process and selecting the analytical techniques to measure these critical variables. The second part of the bird perspective determined the economical feasibility of the PAT implementation based on the strategy formed in part one for three products. After determining the overall feasibility of the PAT implementation a closer look was given to special technologies which contribute to the PAT philosophy in ways of product efficiency, manufacturing flexibility, process understanding and building quality into the products instead of testing quality into products. Critical process variables were determined by analysis of validation data, discussion with plant operators and literature analysis of the fundamental operation of each process step. The critical process variables were determined to be moisture content, identity, and particle size distribution of the raw materials, blend homogeneity of the mixing steps, particle size distribution after granulation, content uniformity of the drug substance and hardness of tablets, coating thickness, final tablet moisture content, droplet size distribution of coating solution, identity of material packaged and package integrity. Analytical techniques to measure each of the critical variables were chosen based on a literature search to evaluate what techniques are available and further narrowed based on availability of equipment. Diffuse reflectance near infrared spectroscopy (DRNIR) is recommended for determining component identity, moisture content, blend homogeneity, hardness, coating thickness, and material identity. Transmittance NIR (T-NIR) is recommended for determining content uniformity. Laser light diffraction (LLD) is recommended for determining particle size distribution. The PAT strategy that combines process monitoring and product characterization will hopefully eliminate or at least reduce the need for Quality Assurance / Quality Control (QA / QC) laboratory testing. The first technologies to be implemented should be the ones that are easiest to implement and least expensive. Full adoption of the PAT philosophy will require an alteration of the method used to develop pharmaceuticals. A better scientific understanding of the process and materials will be required so as to result in a process that is fully understood, has a process model and produces materials with built-in quality assurance for real time release. The two areas where PAT can provide the greatest savings were found to be: (1) reduction in Quality Control (QC) testing, leading to real time release and (2) improvement of product yield from better process control. The financial analysis is sensitive to the time when these benefits begin to take effect. Since there is some uncertainty as to when real time release will be approved, two scenarios were created for implementation of PAT. The first scenario (base case) assumes that QC savings start accruing after the installation and qualification of analytical instruments, {{at the end of the}} first year. The second scenario is a conservative case in which it is assumed that the QC savings begin in the third year, after correlations have been developed for tablet friability, disintegration time and dissolution time. PAT implementation is envisioned to occur in three stages. The first phase involves the installation of <b>on-line</b> analytical <b>equipment</b> and results in benefits related to savings in QC costs, reduced time for investigations, and reduced throughput time. During the first phase of PAT implementation, correlations will be developed for process understanding and to replace current analytical tests such as disintegration, dissolution and friability. The second phase is the implementation of process control systems which results in savings due to fewer Food and Drug Administration (FDA) audits, fewer investigations, fewer batch rejections, shorter throughput times, and increased product yield. The third phase is the integration of PAT into the development process of a new product, resulting in quality by design. The third phase was not addressed within this project as PAT implementation was only evaluated for products already on the market and so concentrating on the production side. In order to investigate the impact of PAT on the development process of a new drug product a separate dissertation work would be necessary. For the first scenario (QC savings after the first year), the results of the economic analysis indicate that the implementation of PAT for solid tablet manufacturing is very cost-effective. The Return on Investment (ROI) for implementation of PAT after phase I is 69...|$|R
40|$|The creping {{process and}} the {{conditions}} on the Yankee cylinder dryer are key factors in a tissue paper mill, and they therefore need to be kept under good control {{in order to maintain}} a high and uniform quality. To this end it would be valuable {{to be able to make}} on-line measurements of Yankee coating thickness as well as the crepe structure of the tissue paper. The adhesion of paper to the cylinder affects the creping process and more information about the parameters that affect the adhesion is therefore of interest. To perform trials on a full scale or in a pilot plant is very costly and laboratory creping equipment is therefore sought after in order to be able to measure the adhesion force. The coating layer for use on the cylinder was analysed. It contained a large amount of carbohydrates and could not be considered transparent. The thickness of the coating layer was measured on a laboratory cylinder with a method based on fluorescence. An optical brightener was added to the coating chemicals and the coating layer was subjected to UV-radiation. The intensity of the light emitted by the optical brightener was measured and gave an indication of the thickness of the coating layer. The equipment has to be further investigated before it is possible to implement the new sensor <b>on-line.</b> New creping <b>equipment</b> and an adhesion method were developed for use on a laboratory scale. The equipment can operate with different creping angles and the force needed to crepe the paper can be measured. The highest creping force was obtained for papers of high grammage, low dryness at adhesion, high drainability, high fines content and high hemicellulose content. A more direct method is to analyse the structure of the produced paper. Measurements were made on a tissue paper with an optical fibre sensor while the paper was travelling at low speed. The collected signal was mathematically analysed and the characteristic wavelength was calculated for different paper samples. These values were close to the wavelengths measured with an off line method by a commercial crepe analyser. Baksidestext The creping process is the heart of tissue paper manufacture. To control the process better, on-line measurements of paper structure and coating thickness are sought after. The creping is highly dependent on the adhesion of the paper to the Yankee dryer. To be able to measure the adhesion, laboratory creping equipment was also required. Different pulp parameters affect the adhesion and some of them have been investigated in this work. The coating on the Yankee cylinder consisted mainly of fiber fragments and could not be considered as transparent, which had to be considered when choosing a method to measure coating thickness. A method based on the light emitted from an optical brightener in the coating when subjected to UV-irradiation was used, but has to be further improved before it can be used on-line. A new laboratory creping method was developed to determine the adhesion between paper and metal, and the force needed to scrape off the paper with a doctor blade was measured. The highest creping force was obtained for papers made of pulp with a high drainability, high fines content and high hemicellulose content. An optical method using reflected light to measure crepe wavelength on-line was developed. The paper travelled under a sensor and the light collected was mathematically analyzed to determine the most common wavelength...|$|R
