40|$|A load {{regulating}} mechanical latch {{is described}} {{that has a}} pivotally mounted latch element having a hook-shaped end with a strike roller-engaging laterally <b>open</b> <b>hook</b> for engaging a stationary strike roller. The latch element or hook is pivotally mounted in a clevis end of an elongated latch stem that is adapted for axial movement through an opening in a support plate or bracket mounted to a structural member. A coil spring is disposed over and around the extending latch stem and {{the lower end of}} the coil spring engages the support bracket. A thrust washer is removably attached to the other end of the latch stem and engages the other end of the coil spring and compresses the coil spring thereby preloading the spring and the latch element carried by the latch stem. The hook-shaped latch element has a limited degree of axial travel for loading caused by structural distortion which may change the relative positions of the latch element hook and the strike roller. Means are also provided to permit limited tilt of the latch element due to loading of the hook...|$|E

50|$|The {{park was}} also the home field of the Demon Deacons {{baseball}} team until they <b>opened</b> Gene <b>Hooks</b> Stadium on campus in 1981. Because Hooks Stadium lacked lights, some early-season and necessary night games continued to be played at Ernie Shore Field. Like their now-demolished on-campus ballpark, the renamed Ernie Shore Field honors former Wake Forest athletic director Gene Hooks.|$|R
50|$|Landing, {{originally}} {{scheduled for}} 1:34 UTC 24 September, was postponed due to difficulties in undocking the Soyuz spacecraft from the ISS. The crew entered the Soyuz TMA-18 on 23 September {{and closed the}} main hatch at 6:35 pm EDT. Skvortsov, Kornienko and Caldwell Dyson experienced problems getting a tight seal and were forced to open the Soyuz hatch for a quick inspection. The hatch later was sealed, but Expedition 25 flight engineer Yurchikhin working inside the space station had problems confirming a tight fit with the hatch on the ISS side of the interface. After an extended leak check, flight controllers in Moscow decided the docking interface was tight and leak free. As the countdown neared for undocking, commands were sent to <b>open</b> <b>hooks</b> on the MRM2 module side of the interface. But the mechanism did not respond. It was not clear what caused the hooks not to respond, however, Yurchikhin reported finding a small gear floating from the mechanism when he removed a cover.|$|R
5000|$|The need to [...] "catch" [...] {{freshwater}} mussels for the [...] "pearl" [...] button industry spurred {{the invention of}} tools to make the job easier than [...] "pollywogging" [...] with bare feet. In 1897 inventive mussel fishermen bent steel bars into wide <b>open</b> <b>hooks</b> which they called [...] "brail hooks" [...] or [...] "crow foots" [...] and used {{them to try to}} catch or trap the {{freshwater mussels}}. The process was simple: several of these [...] "brail hooks" [...] were attached to a long wooden bar with lengths of rope and the entire assembly was lowered into the river and dragged behind a boat along the river bottom. When the tips of these hooks came in contact with an [...] "open" [...] freshwater mussel, the mussel clamped its valves shut around the hooks and could be lifted from the bottom. Within {{a short period of time}} millions of freshwater mussels were collected in this manner.|$|R
25|$|As {{the group}} keeps {{trying to escape}} out of the realm, they end up {{ultimately}} running into dead ends at every turn. Suddenly, thanks to Henry inspiring the New Yorkers to toss coins into the Bethesda fountain, a portal <b>opens,</b> and <b>Hook,</b> Snow, David, Zelena, and Jekyll escape and find themselves in New York City, {{right in front of}} the fountain, where they renuite with Emma, Regina, Henry, and Violet.|$|R
5000|$|The {{olive drab}} U.S. Army Shade 7 cotton canvas [...] "Suspenders, Individual Equipment Belt" [...] (also {{designated}} [...] "Suspenders, Field Pack, Combat, M-1956") were manufactured in Regular (FSN 8465-577-4922), Long (FSN 8465-577-4923), and X-Long (FSN 8465-823-7231) lengths to United States military specification MIL-S-40160. They are additionally adjustable in length {{by means of}} sliding metal friction fasteners. Early production individual equipment belt suspenders attach to the individual equipment belt by means of <b>open</b> bent-wire <b>hooks</b> which {{are attached to the}} individual equipment belt's upper set of eyelets. Later production individual equipment belt suspenders utilize closing hooks in the rear and <b>open</b> cast <b>hooks</b> in the front. The individual equipment belt suspenders feature a row of web straps over the shoulders for attaching equipment and each side featured a metal rectangular ring where the frontal web straps and the padded shoulder portion joined for additional equipment attachment. The underside of the padded portion of the suspenders is a thinner canvas in earlier-production suspenders and nylon in some of the latest examples.|$|R
50|$|In October 1900, {{pharmacist}} John A. <b>Hook</b> <b>opened</b> {{the first}} <b>Hook's</b> Drug Store in an Indianapolis German community {{at the corner}} of South East and Prospect Streets. A second location opened {{at the corner of}} New Jersey and East Washington Streets and Hook added Edward F. Roesch as a partner. By 1912, the chain had expanded to twelve stores. Many of Hook's interwar drug stores were designed by Kurt Vonnegut Sr. of Vonnegut & Bohn. Roesch became president of the company in 1943 upon Hook's death. In 1956, following Roesch's death in a traffic accident, John Hook's son, August F. “Bud” Hook, assumed leadership of the company. The chain added 150 new stores between 1946 and 1972.|$|R
40|$|Coumarin, at {{concentrations}} between 1. 0 and 0. 1 mm, inhibited red light-induced {{opening of}} the etiolated bean hypocotyl hook. In addition, anthocyanin synthesis and geotropic bending were inhibited. Coumarin stimulated ethylene synthesis, and ethylene was shown to mediate the inhibitory actions of coumarin. This conclusion was supported by: (a) the parallel concentration dependence and time sequence of hook closing and ethylene synthesis, (b) the restriction of the bulk of coumarin-induced ethylene production to the curved portion of the hook where opening is expressed, (c) the ability of both coumarin and ethylene to reclose partially <b>opened</b> <b>hooks,</b> and (d) the ability of exogenous ethylene, in the amounts produced by coumarintreated hooks, to duplicate the inhibitory effects of coumarin. There was an increasing stimulation of growth of the straight portion of the hypocotyl hook section as coumarin concentrations were increased from 0. 1 to 1. 0 mm. This action of coumarin was not duplicated by ethylene and occurred regardless of {{the presence or absence}} of added ethylene. The results of this study suggest that many actions of coumarin in growth systems are mediated by ethylene produced in response to the coumarin...|$|R
50|$|Just {{prior to}} release, the {{aircraft}} activates the Release Consent discrete and sends the weapon an arming command using the MIL-STD-1553 interface. The SMS will {{verify that the}} weapon release conditions have all been fulfilled, and it will activate the signals (not part of the MIL-STD-1760 interface) that cause the weapon to be released. In {{the case of a}} bomb, this is typically done by energizing an electro-explosive device that simultaneously <b>opens</b> the <b>hooks</b> that hold the bomb on the aircraft during carriage, and also operate a plunger that pushes the bomb away from the aircraft (at high speeds there is a tendency for the weapon to remain in close proximity to the aircraft after the bomb <b>hooks</b> <b>open).</b> The MIL-STD-1760 connector will release as the bomb falls away from the aircraft, and the SMS will detect that the bomb has separated by the open circuit between the Interlock and Interlock Return discrete signals.|$|R

5000|$|The Open Society and Its Enemies {{was praised}} by the {{philosophers}} Bertrand Russell, who called it [...] "a work of first-class importance" [...] and [...] "a vigorous and profound defence of democracy", and Sidney Hook who {{called it a}} [...] "subtly argued and passionately written" [...] critique of the [...] "historicist ideas that threaten the love of freedom {{and the existence of}} an <b>open</b> society". <b>Hook</b> calls Popper's critique of the cardinal beliefs of historicism [...] "undoubtedly sound", noting that historicism [...] "overlooks the presence of genuine alternatives in history, the operation of plural causal processes in the historical pattern, and the role of human ideals in redetermining the future". Nevertheless, Hook argues that Popper [...] "reads Plato too literally when it serves his purposes and is too cocksure about what Plato's 'real' meaning is when the texts are ambiguous", and calls Popper's treatment of Hegel [...] "downright abusive" [...] and [...] "demonstrably false", noting that [...] "there is not a single reference to Hegel in Hitler's Mein Kampf".|$|R
50|$|Crossbars were {{historically}} common, simple fasteners consisting simply of a plank or beam {{mounted to}} one side of a door by a set of cleats. The board could be slid past the frame to block the door. Alternatively, the bar can be a separate piece that is placed into <b>open</b> cleats or <b>hooks,</b> extending across the frame on both sides. The effect of this device is essentially the opposite of the crash bar in that its operation is to permit the door to be opened inward rather than outward. On a set of double doors, the same principle works, but needn't extend past the frame. The bar simply extends into another set of cleats on the other door such as to interfere with the door opening.|$|R
