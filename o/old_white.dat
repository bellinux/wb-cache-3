5|$|The <b>Old</b> <b>White</b> Hart Inn is Grade II listed, and {{described}} as a late 16th-century building. The building was an end entry house but it is unclear when it became an inn. It has been suspected that the building was previously used as a courthouse, but this has never been proved. Moreover, tokens were given out under the <b>Old</b> <b>White</b> Hart's name in the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Once White Plains {{became the}} county seat of Westchester in 1759, the road between this village {{and the city of}} New York (then {{encompassing}} only Manhattan) became an important route and was established as the White Plains Post Road. Before 1797, the main road heading to points north and east out of Manhattan went via Kingsbridge along the old Boston Post Road. A new bridge over the Harlem River (the original Harlem Bridge) was opened in 1797, shortening the route out of Manhattan. This also relocated the Boston and White Plains Post roads to a new alignment along Third Avenue and Boston Road. The White Plains Post Road separated from the Boston Post Road in Bronxdale, with the road to Boston heading east and the road to White Plains heading north. The <b>old</b> <b>White</b> Plains Post Road roughly followed the alignment of modern-day White Plains Road, which was laid out in 1863. (The original post road was to the east of the modern-day avenue). The White Plains Post Road continued north through Olinville, Wakefield, and Mount Vernon, where the route shifted east to modern-day White Plains Post Road, going through Bronxville and Scarsdale to White Plains.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Old</b> <b>White</b> Horse Cellar, at No.155, {{was one of}} {{the most}} famous {{coaching}} inns in England by the late 18th century, by which time the street had become a favourable location for booksellers. The Bath Hotel emerged around 1790, and Walsingham House was built in 1887. Both the Bath and the Walsingham were purchased and demolished, and the prestigious Ritz Hotel built on their site in 1906. Piccadilly Circus station, at the east end of the street, was designed by Charles Holden and built between 1925 and 1928. It was the first underground station to have no above-ground premises; the station is only accessible by subways from street level. The clothing store Simpson's was established at Nos.203–206 Piccadilly by Alec Simpson in 1936. During the 20th century, Piccadilly became known as a place to acquire heroin, and was notorious in the 1960s as the centre of London's illegal drug trade. Today, it is regarded as one of London's principal shopping streets. Its landmarks include the Ritz, Park Lane, Athenaeum and Intercontinental hotels, Fortnum & Mason, the Royal Academy, the RAF Club, Hatchards, the Embassy of Japan and the High Commission of Malta.|$|E

40|$|MA (Psychology), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Social and {{demographic}} changes {{have a tremendous}} effect on the care for older people {{to the effect that}} caring for older people might have become a rare commodity. Increased life expectancy during the past century has prolonged the period in which older people need care and has made family care giving an increasingly recurrent activity for adult children. After the demolition of the apartheid area in South Africa, most research focused on previously disadvantaged groups, namely Black and Brown people which resulted in a research gap regarding <b>older</b> <b>White</b> people. Little is known about <b>older</b> <b>White</b> people’s experiences of care in South Africa, as <b>older</b> <b>White</b> people are viewed as the minority group who were not previously disadvantaged. However, <b>older</b> <b>White</b> people’s vulnerability is increasing because poverty is currently escalating amongst <b>older</b> <b>White</b> South African people as a result of early retirement and retrenchment because of employment equity and the conversion goal of Black Economic Empowerment. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore <b>older</b> <b>White</b> people’s experiences of giving care to and receiving care from their children. A qualitative research approach with an explorative and descriptive nature was utilized for this study as the research question was aimed at understanding a subjective phenomenon. This research design allows the participants to give meaning to their own experiences. A case study design was followed during this research study in order to provide an in-depth description of <b>older</b> <b>White</b> people’s experience of care. The specific population for this study consisted of all <b>White</b> people <b>older</b> than 60 years, co-residing with their adult children and living in the Midvaal area of the Vaal Triangle, Gauteng. Data were collected through journaling and semi-structured interviews, with 10 <b>older</b> <b>White</b> people. Interviews were conducted on a one-on-one basis at the office of the researcher or at the houses of the participants. This ensured the preservation of the participants’ relationship with their children. The interviews were audio recorded and transcribed. Data were reduced through thematic data analysis and emerging themes and categories were identified. The principles and strategies for enhancing the trustworthiness of the data were done through crystallization and neutrality. The results indicated that <b>older</b> <b>White</b> people’s experience of care can be summarized by means of physical, emotional and financial care. Most of the participants in this study were still physically independent from their children and they could attend to their own physical care. Emotional care was identified by the participants as the ultimate indicator of caring and this component contributed profoundly to their psychological well-being. The financial care component highlighted that <b>older</b> <b>White</b> people’s vulnerability is increasing and that poverty is more prevalent in <b>older</b> <b>White</b> people than what is reflected in current research.

40|$|Objectives. Common {{facets of}} {{religion}} are {{those aspects of}} religion that can be shared by people from any racial group. In contrast, unique facets of religion are available only to people in specific racial groups. The {{purpose of this study}} is to evaluate the interface among common facets of religion, unique facets of religion, and life satisfaction in a nationwide sample of older Black people. Methods. Interviews were conducted with a nationally representative sample of older African Americans. Survey items were administered to assess common religious factors (e. g., the frequency of church attendance) and unique religious factors (i. e., the belief that religion sustains Black people in the face of racial adversity). Subjective well-being was measured with a life satisfaction index. Results. The findings reveal that both the common and the unique aspects of religion contribute to life satisfaction among older African Americans. Discussion. Most studies on race differences in religion focus solely on common religious factors that may enhance the subjective well-being of <b>older</b> <b>Whites</b> as well as older Blacks. The findings from this study are important because they call attention to the insight that can be obtained by also taking the unique facets of religion for older Black people into consideration. R ESEARCH indicates that involvement in religion may beassociated with better physical health and enhanced feelings of subjective well-being across the life course (Koenig, McCullough, & Larson, 2001). Moreover, this literature further reveals that older African Americans may be more likely than <b>older</b> <b>Whites</b> to enjoy these health-related benefits (Krause, 2002 a). Some investigators attribute these findings to the fact that older Blacks are more religious than <b>older</b> <b>Whites</b> (Levin, Taylor, & Chatters, 1994). So, for example, a number of studies reveal that older Blacks are more likely to go to church services, read the Bible, and pray than <b>older</b> <b>Whites</b> (Krause, 2003; Levin et al., 1994). This research also indicates that older Blacks are more likely than <b>older</b> <b>Whites</b> to receive informal social support from church members, and they are more likely to feel they have a closer relationship with God (Krause...|$|R

25|$|At one point, the Dixmont campus {{contained}} over 80 structures. However, in {{an effort}} to modernize the hospital, many of the unused and obsolete buildings were demolished in 1967. These included the Men's Annex (which housed many of the patients who were trusted with work details in the further reaches of the property), greenhouses, stables, barns, garages, and many cottages. To the left of Reed Hall stood the maintenance building which housed the carpenters', electrical, and machinist shops, as well as a basketball and shuffleboard court on the upper level. The four-story Industrial Arts building (sometimes referred to as the Garment Building) was built in 1933 and allowed patients to manufacture textiles, shoes, and furniture. Behind the Hutchinson building was the Rosenzweig House, an <b>old</b> <b>white</b> house that originally was home to the hospital's superintendents, but was later used as the security office.

40|$|Objectives. The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{relationship}} between religious meaning and subjective well-being. A major emphasis is placed on assessing race differences in the relationship between these constructs. Methods. Interviews were conducted with a nationwide sample of <b>older</b> <b>White</b> and <b>older</b> Black adults. Survey items were administered to assess a sense of meaning in life that is derived specifically from religion. Subjective well-being was measured with indices of life satisfaction, self-esteem, and optimism. Results. The findings suggest that older adults who derive a sense of meaning in life from religion tend to have higher levels of life satisfaction, self-esteem, and optimism. The data further reveal that older Black adults are more likely to find meaning in religion than <b>older</b> <b>White</b> adults. In addition, the relationships among religious meaning, life satisfaction, self-esteem, and optimism tend to be stronger for older African Americans persons than <b>older</b> <b>White</b> persons. Discussion. Researchers have argued for some time that religion may be an important source of resilience for older Black adults, but it is not clear how these beneficial effects arise. The data from this study suggest that religious meaning may be an important factor. A rapidly growing literature suggests that greater involve-ment in religion is associated with better physical health, better mental health, and enhanced feelings of subjective well-being across the life course (Ellison, 1994; Koenig, McCul...|$|R
