5|$|Gulf {{also participated}} in a {{partnership}} with other majors, including Texaco, to build the Pembroke Catalytic Cracker refinery at Milford Haven and the associated Mainline Pipelines fuel distribution network. The eventual reopening of the Suez canal and upgrading of the older European oil terminals (Europoort and Marchwood) meant that the financial return from these projects was not all that had been hoped for. The Bantry terminal was devastated by the explosion of a Total tanker, the Betelgeuse, in January 1979 (Whiddy Island Disaster) and it was never fully reopened. The Irish government took over ownership of the terminal in 1986 and held its strategic <b>oil</b> <b>reserve</b> there.|$|E
5|$|The scandal {{which has}} likely done the {{greatest}} damage to Harding's reputation is Teapot Dome. Like {{most of the}} administration's scandals, it came to light after Harding's death, {{and he was not}} aware of the illegal aspects. Teapot Dome involved an <b>oil</b> <b>reserve</b> in Wyoming which was one of three set aside {{for the use of the}} Navy in a national emergency. There was a longstanding argument that the reserves should be developed; Wilson's first Interior Secretary Franklin Knight Lane was an advocate of this position. When the Harding administration took office, Interior Secretary Fall took up Lane's argument and Harding signed an executive order in May 1921 transferring the reserves from the Navy Department to Interior. This was done with the consent of Navy Secretary Edwin C. Denby.|$|E
5|$|Natural gas {{was first}} found in Indiana in 1876 {{but it was}} not until 1886 that the {{magnitude}} of the discovery was known; the Trenton Gas Field was the largest deposit of natural gas discovered in the 19th century and the first giant <b>oil</b> <b>reserve</b> found in the United States. As a professor at a university in the Trenton Field, Haynes offered his services to the drillers and worked to analyze soil samples, determine well pressure, and give estimates on the amount of energy that could be created by the gas. He delivered several lectures to large crowds about the importance of the gas discovery and the many possible applications of this new source of fuel. He began a petition to have the local citizens create a corporation to pump the fuel from the ground and pipe it to area homes and businesses. His promotion was successful and Portland Natural Gas and Oil Company was formed; Haynes' father was named to the new company's board of directors.|$|E
50|$|The SAGD process {{allowed the}} Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) to {{increase}} its proven <b>oil</b> <b>reserves</b> to 179 billion barrels, which raised Canada's <b>oil</b> <b>reserves</b> to the third {{highest in the world}} after Venezuela and Saudi Arabia and approximately quadrupled North American <b>oil</b> <b>reserves.</b> As of 2011, the <b>oil</b> sands <b>reserves</b> stand at around 169 billion barrels.|$|R
50|$|In 2006 Iran {{reported}} crude <b>oil</b> <b>reserves</b> of , {{accounting for}} about 15 percent of OPEC’s proven reserves and 11.4 percent of world proven reserves. While {{the estimate of}} world crude <b>oil</b> <b>reserves</b> remained nearly steady between 2001 and 2006, at , the estimate of Iran’s <b>oil</b> <b>reserves</b> was revised upward by 32 percent when a new field was discovered near Bushehr. Market value of Iran's total <b>oil</b> <b>reserves</b> at international crude price of $75 per barrel stands at ~US $10 trillion.|$|R
5000|$|Alberta is Canada's {{largest oil}} {{producing}} province, providing 79.2% of Canadian oil production in 2015. This included light crude oil, heavy crude oil, crude bitumen, synthetic crude oil, and natural-gas condensate. In 2015 Alberta produced {{an average of}} [...] of Canada's [...] of oil and equivalent production. Most of its oil production came from its enormous oil sands deposits, whose production has been steadily rising in recent years. These deposits give Canada the world's third largest <b>oil</b> <b>reserves,</b> which are rivaled only by similar but even larger <b>oil</b> <b>reserves</b> in Venezuela, and conventional <b>oil</b> <b>reserves</b> in Saudi Arabia. Although Alberta has already produced over 90% of its conventional crude <b>oil</b> <b>reserves,</b> it has produced only 5% of its oil sands, and its remaining <b>oil</b> sands <b>reserves</b> represent 98% of Canada's established <b>oil</b> <b>reserves.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{costs of}} salvage, clean-up, and {{compensation}} {{are believed to}} have totalled around US$120 million. That included compensation paid by Total to Gulf. Most of the relevant costs were paid by insurance companies and all the various claims and counter-claims were eventually settled out of court. Gulf never reopened the terminal and a feasibility study in 1985 showed that it no longer had any potential use in international oil trade. In 1986, Gulf surrendered its lease on the site to the Irish government. The government used the terminal (after carrying out a limited refurbishment) to hold its strategic <b>oil</b> <b>reserve.</b> Initially, oil movement to and from the terminal was carried out by road. In 1990, {{at the time of the}} first Gulf war, an improvised repair was carried out to the jetty to allow an oil tanker to offload at the terminal on a one-off basis. In 1996, an unloading buoy was installed and this has been used since that time.|$|E

25|$|The Rhodesians' {{means to}} {{continue}} the war were also eroding fast. In December 1978, a ZANLA unit penetrated the outskirts of Salisbury and fired a volley of rockets and incendiary device rounds into the main oil storage depot – the most heavily defended economic asset in the country. The storage tanks burned for five days, giving off a column of smoke {{that could be seen}} 80 miles away. Half a million barrels of petroleum product (comprising Rhodesia's strategic <b>oil</b> <b>reserve)</b> were lost. At a stroke, the country's annual budget deficit was increased by 20%.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, the energy {{generated}} by the dam for the next 50 years, {{at an average of}} 4419 MW, is 1.14 bboe (billion barrels of oil equivalent). This is approximately 9% of the proven <b>oil</b> <b>reserves</b> of Brazil (12.6 bbl), or 2% of the total <b>oil</b> <b>reserves</b> of Russia (60 bbl), or 5.5% of the proven <b>oil</b> <b>reserves</b> of the U.S. (21 bbl).|$|R
5000|$|Estimates {{of total}} <b>oil</b> <b>reserves</b> in Cuba are varied, and depend mainly on estimations of undiscovered {{offshore}} deposits in the North Cuba Basin. Proved crude <b>oil</b> <b>reserves</b> were 124 million barrels as of 2013.|$|R

25|$|The {{alliance}} with the US proved not universal, however, when in July 1956 Gamal Abdel Nasser, President of Egypt, unexpectedly nationalised (seized) the Suez Canal, following the withdrawal of Anglo-American funding for the Aswan Dam. Eden believed the nationalisation was {{in violation of the}} Anglo-Egyptian Agreement that Nasser had signed with the British and French governments on 19 October 1954. This view was shared by Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell and Liberal leader Jo Grimond. In 1956 the Suez Canal was of vital importance since over two-thirds of the oil supplies of Western Europe (60 million tons annually) passed through it, with 15,000 ships a year, one-third of them British; three-quarters of all Canal shipping belonged to NATO countries. Britain's total <b>oil</b> <b>reserve</b> {{at the time of the}} nationalisation was enough for only six weeks. The Soviet Union was certain to veto any sanctions against Nasser at the United Nations. Britain and a conference of other nations met in London following the nationalisation in an attempt to resolve the crisis through diplomatic means. However, the Eighteen Nations Proposals, including an offer of Egyptian representation on the board of the Suez Canal Company and a share of profits, were rejected by Nasser. Eden feared that Nasser intended to form an Arab Alliance that would threaten to cut off oil supplies to Europe and, in conjunction with France, decided he should be removed from power.|$|E
500|$|At FBI headquarters, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) tells John Doggett (Robert Patrick) {{about the}} murder and {{explains}} that ninety percent of de la Cruz's body was covered with apparent radiation burns. Galpex Petroleum, the platform's owner, officially attributes the burns to an explosion but Mulder suspects the involvement of black oil. Mulder and Doggett meet Galpex's vice-president Martin Ortega (Miguel Sandoval), who tells them {{that the company has}} discovered a large <b>oil</b> <b>reserve</b> in the Gulf. Alvin Kersh (James Pickens, Jr.) sends Doggett to the Gulf to investigate, but Mulder is already present when Doggett arrives. The agents meet Taylor, who claims de la Cruz tried to blow up the platform.|$|E
500|$|Voorhis often {{opposed the}} {{petroleum}} industry, questioning {{the need for}} the oil depletion allowance. In 1943, he was told by a Pasadena attorney that the Navy Department was planning to grant Standard Oil exclusive free drilling rights in the vast Elk Hills naval reserve in central California, then thought to be the richest <b>oil</b> <b>reserve</b> outside the Arabian Peninsula. The congressman in a speech from the House floor in May 1943 exposed the deal, which was soon cancelled. The Washington Post hailed him as a hero, and House Naval Affairs Committee Chairman Carl Vinson of Georgia stated that Voorhis had performed [...] "the greatest kind of service". However, the Los Angeles Times suggested that Voorhis had harmed the war effort by depriving the people of California of gasoline. In 1945, Voorhis fought a bill which would have given oil companies offshore drilling rights. The petroleum industry journal Second Issue blamed the defeat of the bill on Voorhis. Nixon biographer Roger Morris suggested that these stands led oil companies to give Nixon substantial, but surreptitious, financial assistance during the 1946 campaign against Voorhis.|$|E

2500|$|All IEA member {{countries}} who are net oil importers have legal obligation to hold emergency oil reserves, which {{is equivalent to}} at least 90 days of net oil imports of the previous year. [...] Furthermore, under the EU regulations there is obligation to hold reserves equivalent to 90 days of consumption, so unlike the gas dispute with Ukraine in 2006, consumers were not affected. Poland had an 80-day <b>oil</b> <b>reserve.</b> The Czech Republic reported drawing oil from its 100-day reserves.

2500|$|The idea of {{oil well}} and <b>oil</b> <b>reserve</b> smoke pluming into the {{stratosphere}} serving as a main contributor to the soot of a nuclear winter was a central idea of the early climatology papers on the hypothesis; they were considered more of a possible contributor than smoke from cities, as the smoke from oil has a higher ratio of black soot, thus absorbing more sunlight. Hobbs compared the papers' assumed [...] "emission factor" [...] or soot generating efficiency from ignited oil pools and found, upon comparing to measured values from oil pools at Kuwait, which were the greatest soot producers, the emissions of soot assumed in the nuclear winter calculations were still [...] "too high". Following {{the results of the}} Kuwaiti oil fires being in disagreement with the core nuclear winter promoting scientists, 1990s nuclear winter papers generally attempted to distance themselves from suggesting oil well and reserve smoke will reach the stratosphere.|$|E

2500|$|During the {{dismantling}} of the Ottoman Empire after the war, most of Ottoman Syria came under the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon and most of Ottoman Iraq came under British mandate. Heated and prolonged negotiations ensued regarding which companies could invest in the Turkish Petroleum Company. The TPC was granted exclusive oil exploration rights to Mesopotamia in 1925. The discovery of a large <b>oil</b> <b>reserve</b> at Baba Gurgur provided the impetus to conclude negotiations and in July 1928 an agreement, called the [...] "Red Line Agreement", was signed which determined which oil companies could invest in TPC and reserved 5% of the shares for Gulbenkian. The name of the company was changed to the Iraq Petroleum Company in 1929. The Pasha had actually given Gulbenkian the entire Iraqi oil concession. Gulbenkian, however, saw advantage in divesting the vast majority of his concession so that corporations would be able to develop the whole. Gulbenkian grew wealthy on the remainder.
