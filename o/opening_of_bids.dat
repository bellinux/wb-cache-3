Robert Moses, Hempstead Town Supervisor Edward Larkin, and Nassau County Executive Holly Patterson also attended the event. After the ceremony, a motorcade led by Moses traveled from the Northern State Parkway south to Roosevelt Field Shopping Center. At Roosevelt Field, the board chairman for Roosevelt Field, Inc., William Zeckendorf, honored Moses and Harriman with brand new tankards made of sterling silver. On July5, 1962, the New York State Assembly announced the <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> <b>bids</b> on the widening of a [...] section of the Meadowbrook between Merrick Road and the Southern State Parkway. Bids were to be accepted on the project in August, with a price tag of $3.851 million (1962USD). The construction would widen the segment from four lanes to six and add a new center median. The widening was prompted by the frequency of accidents along the stretch, and efforts to develop the project were sped up as a result. Completion was set for 1964, and the reconstruction and repaving was finished on November18, 1964.|$|E

50|$|On February 25, 1971, it was {{announced}} that contract letting for the section of the route between Glenwood Park in Kane and East Kane, including Hacker Street, would take place on April 30. Residents in East Kane voiced opposition to reconstructing the route in their village in March 1971, and believed that the state found it more important to provide a route to Kane while taking a lot of land from people in East Kane to construct the highway. In late April, the <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> <b>bids</b> for the section of PA 321 through Kane was postponed due to approval needed from the Public Utilities Commission on changes made to the nearby Baltimore and Ohio Railroad siding.|$|E

50|$|Structure {{and meaning}} <b>of</b> <b>opening</b> <b>bids</b> are the common {{determining}} factor for system classification: in most modern natural systems, <b>opening</b> <b>bids</b> <b>of</b> 1 through 2 {{have the same}} or similar meaning, with level-one bids denoting length in a suit. Artificial systems typically reserve at least one one-level suit opening bid for special purposes, unrelated to the suit.|$|R
50|$|The central {{feature of}} the Precision system is that an <b>opening</b> <b>bid</b> <b>of</b> one club is used for any hand with 16 or more high card points (HCP), {{regardless}} <b>of</b> distribution. An <b>opening</b> <b>bid</b> <b>of</b> one of a major suit signifies a five-card suit and 11-15 HCP. A one notrump opening bid signifies a balanced hand (no five-card major suit) and 13-15 HCP.|$|R

50|$|When the Americans {{took control}} of the Philippine Islands, the new colonial {{government}} decided to complete the work. Proposals for the steelwork were advertised for in June and July, 1900. The bids were opened in August, but owing to an irregularity in the <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> <b>bids,</b> all bids were rejected. The matter was finally settled in October 1900, by purchasing the bridge offered by the original lowest bidder. In the meanwhile, nothing had been done toward starting the work on the piers, abutments and approaches. In October, plans and specifications for the abutments, piers and approaches were made, and in the month of November proposals were asked for by advertisement. Rids were opened December 1. The three bids received were of $95,000.00, $89,542.50, and $53,387.50, all U.S. currency. The lowest bid was accepted. The contract called for the piers and abutments by April l, and of the entire work by June 1, 1901.|$|E

At the beginning, legislation of public procurement is presented and describes the different procedures, which usually occur in the construction field.

The tender documents, procedure for submission and <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> <b>bids,</b> competitive insight and the subscriber's decision to contract is presented. In making the offer, the starting points are presented, which the provider has taken into account in calculations of pro forma and wondered whether the decision to choose company with the low offer price is correct or not. The execution of the work, comparison of the project and the works carried out and its variations is presented.

5000|$|Note that, in the [...] "Weak Twos" [...] convention, an <b>opening</b> <b>bid</b> <b>of</b> two clubs (2) {{is strong}} and artificial, {{typically}} showing at least 22 HCP, and thus is not available for preemption for hand with six clubs. Thus, some partnerships bid 3 with good preemptive hand (typically at least 8 HCP) that has only six clubs. Many partnerships that use an <b>opening</b> <b>bid</b> <b>of</b> 2 as a conventional bid will likewise bid 3 with a good preemptive hand that has only six diamonds.|$|R

5000|$|Benjaminised (Benji) Acol: {{recognising}} {{that strong}} two opening bids occur rarely, the 2 and 2 openings {{are used as}} weak two bids to show weak hands containing long suits (under 10 HCP and a 6-card suit). Very strong hands (8 or more playing tricks, equivalent to an Acol Strong Two) are shown by an <b>opening</b> <b>bid</b> <b>of</b> 2 which forces a 2 response allowing suits to be shown. The strongest hands (e.g., 23+ points or a game force hand, equivalent to the Acol 2 opening) are shown by an <b>opening</b> <b>bid</b> <b>of</b> 2.|$|R
5000|$|The wide-ranging 1 <b>of</b> a suit <b>bid</b> is {{the most}} common opening bid, {{accounting}} for about 75-80% <b>of</b> <b>opening</b> <b>bids.</b> The 1NT opening occurs on about 20% of biddable hands if [...] "weak", or 10% if [...] "strong".|$|R

50|$|Another {{advantage}} is the relative precision with which strong balanced hands can be <b>bid.</b> An <b>opening</b> <b>bid</b> <b>of</b> 2 NT indicates a balanced hand with 20-21 HCP in Standard American or 20-22 HCP in standard Acol, and for even stronger balanced hands, the <b>opening</b> <b>bid</b> <b>of</b> 2 can be used. The opener's rebid (in these cases always in No Trump) then indicates {{the strength of}} the hand using steps of 2-3 HCP. Hence 2 - 2 - 2NT shows 22-24 HCP's in Standard American or 23-24 HCP in Acol, while a 3NT rebid can show 25+ HCP's.|$|R
