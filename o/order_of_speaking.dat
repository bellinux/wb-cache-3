40|$|How much {{adversarial}} noise can protocols for {{interactive communication}} tolerate? This question was examined by Braverman and Rao (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 2014) {{for the case}} of "robust" protocols, where each party sends messages only in fixed and predetermined rounds. We consider {{a new class of}} non-robust protocols for Interactive Communication, which we call adaptive protocols. Such protocols adapt structurally to the noise induced by the channel in the sense that both the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>speaking,</b> and the length of the protocol may vary depending on observed noise. We define models that capture adaptive protocols and study upper and lower bounds on the permissible noise rate in these models. When the length of the protocol may adaptively change according to the noise, we demonstrate a protocol that tolerates noise rates up to $ 1 / 3 $. When the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>speaking</b> may adaptively change as well, we demonstrate a protocol that tolerates noise rates up to $ 2 / 3 $. Hence, adaptivity circumvents an impossibility result of $ 1 / 4 $ on the fraction of tolerable noise (Braverman and Rao, 2014).

40|$|When humans {{talk to one}} another, they overwhelm-ingly {{engage in}} conversation—that is, speech {{exchange}} between two or more parties {{where there is no}} external imposition of procedures on the flow of talk. This is in contrast with conventionally established forms of speech exchange, such as debates, interviews, ceremonies, and courtroom proceedings. In the latter cases, the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>speaking,</b> length of turns, or content of what is said is managed by preestablished arrangements. Conversation, on the other hand, is managed locally by the participants, turn by turn, in terms of who speaks when, for how long, and about what. Given its anarchistic nature, conversation proceeds remarkably smoothly. Typically, conversational partners take turns, with one person being treated by coparticipants as having the right and also the obligation to speak (while coparticipants have the right and obligation to attend to the speaker), and then smoothly relinquishing that status as another person begins talking. Thus, in most cases of conversation, speech is exchanged nearly continuously by speakers taking turns, with minimal gaps in the talk and minimal overlaps. Simultaneous talk and silences do occur in conversa-tion, but such events are themselves organized relative to turn-taking. Sometimes, this involves competition for the turn, as when two potential speakers start simultaneously, the previous speaker adds to an already completed utter-ance, or a listener directly interrupts in an attempt to take over the turn (French & Local, 1983; Schegloff, 2000). Such skirmishes are typically brief, usually settled by one party’s dropping out. Other cases of simultaneous talk are treated as nonproblematic by participants. These include collaborative turn completions (Lerner, 1991, 1996) and recognition point interruptions (Jefferson, 1973, 1984), in which a listener begins speaking to indicate comprehen-sion or affiliation, and back-channeling, in which brief interjections (e. g., “yeah ” or “wow”) occur that are not treated by either party as an attempt to take the turn. There are even situations in which choral coproduction can prop-erly occur, such as mutual greetings when guests arrive at a party (Lerner, 2002).

40|$|We {{build our}} own realities. We {{construct}} meaning through our personal, social, and cultural experiences. It is our nature to unconsciously create an underlying structure as a guideline to revolve around in our lives. This structure isn’t always enough. It would supply support until limitations occur from the changes evolving in every aspect. When {{we feel the}} constriction from these limitations, we react and search for solutions. Jacques Derrida’s Deconstruction Theory suggests that transforming the so-called structure as a solution begins in dissecting meaning. “Whether in the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>spoken</b> or written discourse, no element can function as a sign without referring to another element which itself is not simply present” (Derrida 26). Derrida argues that in Western thought, the idea of defining meaning {{is based on the}} concept of a center, a presence, or a fixed point. He points out that a consequential meaning is never present, but rather is revealed from the contrast of its binary opposite, such as reality/illusion, masculine/feminine, good/bad, etc. By decentering the meaning, deconstruction subverts and shifts from central to marginal and aims to reveal the original meanings instead of being in opposition. It creates new terms; it does not intend to synthesize the concepts in opposition, but to understand their difference and their eternal interaction...|$|R

40|$|Attended {{speech is}} comprehended better not only if more {{acoustic}} detail is available, but also {{if it is}} semantically highly predictable. But can more acoustic detail or higher predictability turn into disadvantages and distract a listener if the speech signal is to be ignored? Also, does the degree of distraction increase for older listeners who typically show a decline in attentional control ability? Adopting the irrelevant-speech paradigm, we tested whether younger (age 23 – 33 years) and older (60 – 78 years) listeners’ working memory for the serial <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>spoken</b> digits would be disrupted by the presentation of task-irrelevant speech varying in its acoustic detail (using noise-vocoding) and its semantic predictability (of sentence endings). More acoustic detail, but not higher predictability, of task-irrelevant speech aggravated memory interference. This pattern of results did not differ between younger and older listeners, despite generally lower performance in older listeners. Our {{findings suggest that the}} focus of attention determines how acoustics and predictability affect the processing of speech: First, as more acoustic detail is known to enhance speech comprehension and memory for speech, we here demonstrate that more acoustic detail of ignored speech enhances the degree of distraction. Second, while higher predictability of attended speech is known to also enhance speech comprehension under acoustically adverse conditions, higher predictability of ignored speech is unable to exert any distracting effect upon working memory performance in younger or older listeners. These findings suggest that features that make attended speech easier to comprehend do not necessarily enhance distraction by ignored speech...|$|R

40|$|Short-term memory (STM) {{impairments}} are {{prevalent in}} adults with acquired brain injuries. While {{there are several}} published tests to assess these impairments, the majority require speech production, e. g. digit span (Wechsler, 1987). This feature may make them unsuitable for people with aphasia and motor speech disorders because of word finding difficulties and speech demands respectively. If patients perceive the speech demands of the test to be high, the may not engage with testing. Furthermore, existing STM tests are mainly ‘pen-and-paper’ tests, which can jeopardise accuracy. To address these shortcomings, we designed and standardised a novel computerised test that does not require speech output {{and because of the}} computerised delivery it would enable clinicians identify STM impairments with greater precision than current tests. The matching listening span tasks, similar to the non-normed PALPA 13 (Kay, Lesser & Coltheart, 1992) is used to test short-term memory for serial <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>spoken</b> items. Sequences <b>of</b> digits are presented in pairs. The person hears the first sequence, followed by the second sequence and s/he decides whether the two sequences are the same or different. In the computerised test, the sequences are presented in live voice recordings on a portable computer through a software application (Molero Martin, Laird, Hwang & Salis 2013). We collected normative data from healthy older adults (N= 22 - 24) using digits, real words (one- and two-syllables) and non-words (one- and two- syllables). Their performance was scored following two systems. The Highest Span system was the highest span length (e. g. 2 - 8) at which a participant correctly responded to over 7 out of 10 trials at the highest sequence length. Test re-test reliability was also tested in a subgroup of participants. The test will be available as free of charge for clinicians and researchers to use...|$|R

40|$|A functional, perceptual-motor, {{account of}} serial {{short-term}} memory (STM) is examined by investigating {{the way in}} which an irrelevant spoken sequence interferes with verbal serial recall. Even with visual list-presentation, verbal serial recall is particularly susceptible to disruption by irrelevant spoken stimuli that have the same identity as— but that are order-incongruent with—the to-be-remembered items. We test the view that such interference is because of the obligatory perceptual organization <b>of</b> the <b>spoken</b> stimuli yielding a sequence that competes with a subvocal motor-plan assembled to support the reproduction of the to-be-remembered list. In support of this view, the interference can be eliminated without changing either the identities or objective serial <b>order</b> <b>of</b> the <b>spoken</b> stimuli but merely by promoting a subjective perceptual organization that strips them of their order-incongruent relation to the to-be-remembered list (Experiment 1). The interference is also eliminated if subvocal motor sequenceplanning is impeded via articulatory suppression (Experiment 2). The results are in line with the view that performance-limits in verbal serial STM are because of having to exploit perceptual and motor processes for purposes for which they did not evolve, not the inherently limited capacity of structures or mechanisms dedicated to storage...|$|R

5000|$|These {{diagrams}} {{show some}} of the main traits of Tesnière's conception of syntactic structure. Verb centrality is evident, since the verb is the highest word in the stemma (the root). Syntactic units are present; constituents and phrases are identified; they correspond to complete subtrees. An important aspect of these stemmas is that they are [...] "unordered", i.e. they do not reflect actual word order. For Tesnière, structural order (hierarchical order) preceded linear order in the mind of a speaker. A speaker first conceives of what he/she wants to say, whereby this conception consists of words organized hierarchically in terms <b>of</b> connections (structural <b>order).</b> The act <b>of</b> <b>speaking</b> involves transforming structural order to linear order, and conversely, the act of hearing and understanding involves transforming linear order to structural order. This strict separation <b>of</b> the <b>ordering</b> dimensions is a point of contention among modern dependency grammars. Some dependency grammars, i.e. the stratified ones (e.g. Meaning-text theory and Functional generative description) build on this strict separation <b>of</b> structural <b>order</b> and linear order, whereas other dependency grammars (e.g. Word grammar) are monostratal (in syntax) and hence reject the separation.|$|R
