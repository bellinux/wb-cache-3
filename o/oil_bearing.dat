25|$|Exploration boomed. By 1950, Alberta {{was one of}} the world's {{exploration}} hot spots, and {{seismic activity}} grew until 1953. After the Leduc strike, it became clear that Devonian reefs could be prolific oil reservoirs, and exploration concentrated on the search for similar structures. A series of major discoveries followed, and the industry began to appreciate the diversity of geological structures in the province that could contain oil. Early reef discoveries included Redwater in 1948, Golden Spike in 1949, Wizard Lake, Fenn Big Valley and Bonnie Glen in 1951 and Westerose in 1952. In 1953, Mobil Oil made a discovery near Drayton Valley, in a sandstone formation. By 1956, more than 1,500 development wells dotted what became the Pembina oil field (the largest field in western Canada) with hardly a dry hole among them, and the <b>oil</b> <b>bearing</b> Cardium Formation was dubbed the Cardium Freeway. The Swan Hills field, discovered in 1957, exploited a carbonate rock formation.|$|E

50|$|After the {{discovery}} of a reservoir, a petroleum engineer will seek to build a better picture of the accumulation. In a simple textbook example of a uniform reservoir, the first stage is to conduct a seismic survey to determine the possible size of the trap. Appraisal wells can be used to determine the location of oil-water contact and with it, the height of the <b>oil</b> <b>bearing</b> sands. Often coupled with seismic data, it is possible to estimate the volume of <b>oil</b> <b>bearing</b> reservoir.|$|E
50|$|Because the {{propeller}} blades are rotated on high-pressure hydraulic <b>oil</b> <b>bearings,</b> a critical element of Kaplan design {{is to maintain}} a positive seal to prevent emission of oil into the waterway.

40|$|Abstract: Dynamic {{pressure}} <b>oil</b> film <b>bearing</b> is {{an important}} mechanical component of the ship. With the development of large-sized ships, their dynamic pressure oil films often run at high speed and under heavy load generating high oil film pressure. In addition, due to {{the increased use of}} thin walled bearing shell with materials of low elastic modulus, the elastic deformation of the bearing shell which is in dynamic pressure <b>oil</b> film <b>bearing</b> cannot be ignored. During computation, if the effect of elastic deformation on the performance of dynamic pressure <b>oil</b> film <b>bearing</b> is ignored as is usually the practise, the difference between the theoretical and the actual results will be enormous. Therefore, this article took the effect of bearing shell's elastic deformation on bearing performance as the research target. A coupling algorithm program in Matlab is written to simulate and solve the <b>oil</b> film <b>bearing</b> dynamic pressure lubrication theory, considering elastic deformation of bearing shell {{in a way that is}} more aligned with the actual working conditions. Conducted a comparison between the above results and the results with no consideration of elastic deformation and analyzed the process and regularity of the effect of elastic deformation and other factors on the performance of <b>oil</b> film <b>bearing</b> shell in operation under dynamic lubrication. Therefore more accurate theoretical basis can be provided for the design and fault diagnose of dynamic pressure <b>oil</b> film <b>bearing</b> of the ships...|$|R
50|$|Bearings are an {{important}} part of a fan. Sleeve-ring <b>oil</b> <b>bearings</b> are used extensively in fans. Some sleeve-ring bearings may be water-cooled. Water-cooled sleeve bearings are often used when the fan moves hot gases. Heat is conducted through the shaft and into the oil, which must be cooled to prevent overheating the bearing. Lower-speed fans have bearings in hard-to-reach spots, so they use grease-packed bearings.|$|R

40|$|Lecturepg. 27 - 40 The {{integrated}} electric motocompressor is {{a recently}} available technology {{that has the}} advantage of drastically simplifying the machine configuration. The use of a high speed electrical motor in the process gas combined with active magnetic bearings eliminates the dry gas seals and replaces the traditional <b>oil</b> <b>bearings</b> and lube <b>oil</b> circuit. In addition, main auxiliaries can be avoided since the motor cooling system uses the compressor process gas as the cooling medium,making the overall package very simple. As this specific arrangement of the machine cannot be tested and validated as a conventional compressor, a validation test must take care of both the compressor and the motor. On the mechanical standpoint, the use of active magnetic bearings (AMBs) has to be considered. It is well known that AMB characteristics differ from <b>oil</b> <b>bearings</b> in terms of damping and stiffness. This paper addresses specific limitation relative to AMBs and mainly nonlinear phenomena like magnetic material or power electronics saturation. The paper also proposes factory acceptance criteria related to this technology. On the performance standpoint, there are no existing guidelines or standards for determining the thermodynamics performance of such systems. This paper describes the testing methodology of an integrated motor compressor to meet the ASME PTC- 10 (1997) requirements. Finally the paper will provide guideline for comparing the overall performance of the integrated solution compared to a conventional compressor train...|$|R

Additionally, an improved analytical model is proposed...|$|R
50|$|Lubrication {{can also}} be done with an oil, which has {{advantage}} of higher maximum load, but needs some way to keep <b>oil</b> in <b>bearing,</b> as it normally tends {{to run out of}} it. For oil lubrication it is recommended that for applications where oil does not become warmer than 50 °C, oil should be replaced once a year, while for applications where oil does not become warmer than 100 °C, oil should be replaced 4 times per year. For car engines, oil becomes 100 °C but the engine has an oil filter to maintain oil quality; therefore, the oil is usually changed less frequently than the <b>oil</b> in <b>bearings.</b>|$|R
