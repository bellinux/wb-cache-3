5|$|There {{are reasons}} that seamounts are biologically important. They rise {{high in the}} water column, {{creating}} complex current patterns that support life <b>on,</b> <b>around,</b> and above the seamount. The surface of the seamount also provides a substrate upon which organisms can attach themselves and grow. This in turn supports the species that feed on them, in turn supporting the whole ecological food web. Scientists have found that seamounts often provide a habitat for endemic species that are not found anywhere else.|$|E
5|$|At {{the road}} bridge, German {{forces of the}} 9th SS had quickly {{surrounded}} Frost's battalion, cutting them {{off from the rest}} of the division. At around 09:00, the 9th SS Reconnaissance Battalion headed back toward Arnhem from south of the river, having concluded that it was not needed at Nijmegen. Though aware of the British troops at the bridge, it attempted to cross by force. In the resultant two-hour battle, it was beaten back with heavy losses; half of its armored vehicles were destroyed or knocked out and its commanding officer, Viktor Gräbner, was killed in action during the assault. German attacks carried <b>on</b> <b>around</b> the British perimeter at the Arnhem bridge for the rest of the day, but the British continued to hold.|$|E

5|$|Following the 2004 {{victory in}} Allsvenskan, plans {{were made to}} {{construct}} a new stadium. In July 2005, Malmö FF announced that work was to begin on Swedbank Stadion, designed for 18,000 seated spectators and 6,000 standing. The stadium can also accommodate 21,000 as an all-seater for international and European games in which terracing is not allowed. Construction started in 2007 and was finished in 2009. The new stadium is located next to Malmö Stadion. Although there was still small-scale construction going <b>on</b> <b>around</b> the stadium at the time, the stadium was inaugurated on 13 April 2009 with the first home game of the 2009 season against Örgryte IS; Malmö FF's Labinot Harbuzi scored the inaugural goal in the 61st minute. The first Swedish championship won at the stadium occurred in 2010, when the club beat Mjällby AIF on 7 November in {{the final game of}} the season 2–0. Attendance at this game set the stadium record of 24,148. Swedbank Stadion is a UEFA category 4 rated stadium.|$|E
5|$|The {{area around}} Bow Street was first {{developed}} by Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford in 1633. Buildings were first erected {{on the west}} side of the street that year, and it was fully built by around 1635-6. Development to the northeast was restricted by a brick wall that had been built by the Earl's cousin, Edward Russell, 3rd Earl of Bedford, in 1610 as a land boundary and remained undeveloped for some time. It was eventually built <b>on</b> <b>around</b> 1673-7, with eleven properties constructed.|$|E
5|$|Written by Mervyn Haisman & Henry Lincoln, this storyline was {{considered}} around mid-1968. The story {{would be set}} in Scotland in Jamie's ancestral home, Castle McCrimmon, where the Doctor's old foe the Great Intelligence plans to use Jamie's body. At {{the end of the}} story Jamie would remain behind as the new laird. By late April 1968, it was clear that Frazer Hines would be leaving the series sometime during Season Six. One candidate for his departure story was Haisman and Lincoln's third Yeti serial, which they were working <b>on</b> <b>around</b> the start of June. Over the summer, however, the writers became embroiled in a dispute over copyright with the BBC regarding the Quarks, robot monsters which had appeared in their previous Doctor Who commission, The Dominators. The ensuing acrimony resulted in the abandonment of The Laird of McCrimmon during August 1968.|$|E

5|$|In 1967, {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} compare nobelium's chemical behavior to that of terbium, californium, and fermium. All four elements were reacted with chlorine and the resulting chlorides were deposited along a tube, along which they were carried by a gas. It {{was found that the}} nobelium chloride produced was strongly adsorbed on solid surfaces, proving that it was not very volatile, like the chlorides of the other three investigated elements. However, both NoCl2 and NoCl3 were expected to exhibit nonvolatile behavior and hence this experiment was inconclusive as to what the preferred oxidation state of nobelium was. Determination of nobelium's favoring of the +2 state had to wait until the next year, when cation-exchange chromatography and coprecipitation {{experiments were}} carried out <b>on</b> <b>around</b> fifty thousand 255No atoms, finding that it behaved differently from the other actinides and more like the divalent alkaline earth metals. This proved that in aqueous solution, nobelium is most stable in the divalent state when strong oxidizers are absent. Later experimentation in 1974 showed that nobelium eluted with the alkaline earth metals, between Ca2+ and Sr2+. Nobelium is the only f-block element for which the +2 state is the most common and stable one in aqueous solution. This occurs because of the large energy gap between the 5f and 6d orbitals {{at the end of the}} actinide series.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the very}} {{existence}} of the SPARTAN project and thus John's existence, was categorised as classified information. Many within the United Nations Space Command (UNSC), who were aware of this information, were strongly opinionated against the project, as the SPARTAN unit's proven versatility elevated them into direct competition with role-dedicated, established units. Since John emerged as the most exemplary Spartan from among the unit, he became the natural target of their sentiments. Antonio Silva, an officer from one such unit (ODSTs), exemplifies this attitude, and considers the Master Chief the freak product of an experiment that should never be repeated. Although the Chief resents Silva's dishonor to his fallen comrades' memory, he is also loyal to the chain of command, and remains quiet. Following the partial declassification of the SPARTAN project, John's heroic achievements caused the overall sentiment to lean in his favor. Despite these explorations of the character's personality, O'Connor {{said in an interview that}} revealing the face of the Chief is not as important as revealing the events going <b>on</b> <b>around</b> the character.|$|E
5|$|It’s straightforward, heartfelt and classy. Mariah pleads {{with her}} {{departed}} lover – 'When you left I lost {{a part of}} me / It’s still so hard to believe' – and the song’s gentle R roll is perfectly understated, built from a few piano chords and a slowed-down So So Def rhythm. It has a homebody quality, almost like an autumn song would – you can imagine a split-up couple singing it quietly, separately, as the world goes <b>on</b> <b>around</b> them. She’s on a porch with tea; he’s stuck in traffic when he finds Mariah on the radio. It even cleverly references that feel, with Mariah finding the Bobby Womack and Babyface songs on her radio just too tough to hear. There’s no tired 'I tried to 2-way you' retorts, no trash-technology love affair 'I was at the grocery store and this guy had the same ring tone as you, and I cried.' No, there’s a classic sensibility to the lyrics and sound of 'We Belong Together' that makes for perfect – and perfectly universal – pop/R songwriting. In other words, it’s the jam. And there’s probably a happy ending, too: Mariah’s triumphant octave shift finale makes the song’s title an emphatic.|$|E

It opened Friday, May 4, 2012, <b>on</b> <b>around</b> 11,800 screens across 4,349 theaters, and earned $80.8million, marking the second-biggest opening and second-biggest single-day gross. The film's Friday gross included an $18.7million midnight run, {{a record for}} a superhero film Without midnight grosses, the film earned the largest opening-day gross ($62.1million). It also set a Saturday- and Sunday-gross record ($69.6million and $57.1million respectively). In total, it earned a total of $207,438,708 for its debut weekend, setting an opening-weekend record, including an IMAX opening-weekend record of $15.3million and a record for opening-weekend grosses originating from 3D showings ($108million). The opening-weekend audience was evenly split among those under and {{over the age of}} 25, with 60% of the audience male, 55% couples, 24% families and 21% teenagers. Earning $103.1million on its second weekend, the film set a record for the largest second-weekend gross. Other records set by the film include the biggest weekend per-theater average for a wide release ($47,698 per theater), the fastest film to reach $100million and each additional $50million through $550million, and the largest cumulative gross through every day of release until, and including, its forty-third day (with the exception of its first day). It was in first place at the North American box office for three consecutive weekends. The film set a record for the highest monthly share, with its $532.5 million total (through May 31, 2012) accounting for 52% of the total earnings at the North American box office during May.|$|E
5|$|The {{musical score}} for the action {{role-playing}} game Final Fantasy XV, originally a spin-off game called Final Fantasy Versus XIII, was composed primarily by Yoko Shimomura, whose previous work included Parasite Eve, Legend of Mana, and the Kingdom Hearts series. Final Fantasy XV was her first time composing for the Final Fantasy series, so she took a more tentative approach than her Kingdom Hearts projects. Shimomura was involved with the project when XV was still titled Versus XIII, being hired to composed the music in 2006 and staying on through its ten-year development cycle. In 2010, Shimomura was still forming a framework for the game's music, ensuring that the music fitted the game without it solidifying into an image that seemed wrong. Her work over the time prior to its rebranding as Final Fantasy XV was fairly sporadic. Shimomura worked <b>on</b> <b>around</b> 80% of the music: the rest were variations on her work and other themes created by others involved in the soundtrack. Other composers {{who worked on the}} game were Tetsuya Shibata, Yoshino Aoki, Yoshitaka Suzuki and Mitsuhiro Ohta; the latter two assisted with arrangements.|$|E
