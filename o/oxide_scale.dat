40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a study of}} the oxidation behaviour of two multilayer coatings, denoted as MC I and MC II, respectively, which are designed with a three-layer architecture: a Cr-Si barrier layer on the IN 738 substrate, a NiCrAlY intermediate layer, and an aluminised top layer. The emphasis of this research is on the total amount of <b>oxide</b> <b>scales</b> formed and the residual <b>oxide</b> <b>scales</b> on the coatings with various combinations among the three layers to investigate the effects of each layer and the interactions between the layers on the oxidation resistance of the coatings. The difference between the two multilayer coatings is that the Al content in the top layer of MC II is twice as much as that in the top layer of MC I. The coatings are fabricated through a combination of plasma spray and pack cementation processes, and then experience oxidation test at 1050 0 C for 1000 h. The average thicknesses of the <b>oxide</b> <b>scales</b> are around 15 and 45 3 ̆bcm for MC I and MC II, respectively. The experimental results are modelled using the analysis of variance. Two models for the volume of total <b>oxide</b> <b>scales</b> and the ratio of the volume of spalled <b>oxide</b> <b>scales</b> to the volume of total <b>oxide</b> <b>scales,</b> are proposed to study the effects of the coating layers on the formation and spallation of <b>oxide</b> <b>scales,</b> which directly affect the oxidation resistance of the coatings. The experimental and analytical results demonstrate that the Cr-Si layer and its interactions with the other coating layers affect the spallation of <b>oxide</b> <b>scales</b> the most among the three layers.

The interaction between the Cr-Si layer and the NiCrAlY layer, and the increase in Al/Ni ratio of the aluminide top layer, promote the formation of <b>oxide</b> <b>scales</b> and also minimise the spallation of <b>oxide</b> <b>scales.</b> Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

50|$|While UHTCs have {{desirable}} thermal {{and mechanical}} properties, they {{are susceptible to}} oxidation at their elevated operating temperatures. The metal component oxidizes to a gas such as CO2 or NO2, which is rapidly lost at the elevated temperatures UHTCs are most useful at; boron, for example, readily oxidizes to B2O3 which becomes a liquid at 490 °C and vaporizes very rapidly above 1100 °C; in addition, their brittleness makes them poor engineering materials. Current research targets increasing their toughness and oxidation resistance by exploring composites with silicon carbide, the incorporation of fibers, {{and the addition of}} rare-earth hexaborides such as lanthanum hexaboride (LaB6). It has been found that the oxidative resistance of HfB2 and ZrB2 are greatly enhanced through the inclusion of 30% weight silicon carbide due to the formation of a protective glassy surface layer upon the application of temperatures in excess of 1000 °C composed of SiO2. To determine the effect of SiC content on diboride oxidation, ManLabs conducted a series of furnace oxidation experiments, in which the oxidation scale thickness as a function of temperature for pure HfB2, SiC and HfB2 20v% SiC were compared. At temperatures greater than 2100 K the <b>oxide</b> <b>scale</b> thickness on pure HfB2 is thinner than that on pure SiC, and HfB2/20% SiC has the best oxidation resistance. Extreme heat treatment leads to greater oxidation resistance as well as improved mechanical properties such as fracture resistance.|$|E
50|$|Creep {{resistance}} {{is dependent on}} slowing the speed of dislocation motion within a crystal structure. In modern Ni based superalloys, the γ’-Ni3(Al,Ti) phase present acts {{as a barrier to}} dislocation motion. For this reason, this γ’ intermetallic phase, when present in high volume fractions, drastically increases the strength of these alloys due to its ordered nature and high coherency with the γ matrix. The chemical additions of aluminum and titanium promote the creation of the γ’ phase. The γ’ phase size can be precisely controlled by careful precipitation strengthening heat treatments. Many superalloys are produced using a two-phase heat treatment that creates a dispersion of cuboidal γ’ particles known as the primary phase, with a fine dispersion between these known as secondary γ’. In order to improve the oxidation resistance of these alloys, Al, Cr, B, and Y are added. The Al and Cr form oxide layers that passivate the surface and protect the superalloy from further oxidation while B and Y are used to improve the adhesion of this <b>oxide</b> <b>scale</b> to the substrate. Cr, Fe, Co, Mo and Re all preferentially partition to the γ matrix while Al, Ti, Nb, Ta, and V preferentially partition to the γ’ precipitates and solid solution strengthen the matrix and precipitates respectively. In addition to solid solution strengthening, if grain boundaries are present, certain elements are chosen for grain boundary strengthening. B and Zr tend to segregate to the grain boundaries which reduces the grain boundary energy and results in better grain boundary cohesion and ductility. Another form of grain boundary strengthening is achieved through the addition of C and a carbide former, such as Cr, Mo, W, Nb, Ta, Ti, or Hf, which drives precipitation of carbides at grain boundaries and thereby reduces grain boundary sliding.|$|E

The reason why the manufacturing method of the spinel coating affected the <b>oxide</b> <b>scale</b> growth rate was investigated.
