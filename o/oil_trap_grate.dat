40|$|Aggregation between {{suspended}} particulate matter (SPM) and oil droplets, {{which leads to the}} formation of Oil-SPM Aggregates (OSA), is widely acknowledged as a natural process that enhances dispersion of spilled oil in aquatic environments. A new laboratory study was performed to investigate the formation of OSA using the Standard Reference Material 1941 b. The experiments were performed using Arabian Medium, Alaska North Slope and South Louisiana crudes. Sediment concentrations varied from 25 to 300 mg/L. A new procedure was developed to separate the OSAs from the bulk water, measure the <b>oil</b> <b>trapped</b> in OSAs by GC-FID analysis, and isolate the sediment trapped in sinking OSAs for gravimetric quantification. Results showed that this method is appropriate for measuring small amounts (less than 2 mg in this study) of <b>oil</b> <b>trapped</b> in OSAs and does not overestimate the mass of <b>oil</b> <b>trapped</b> in large OSAs as observed in a previous method based on image analysis. For the three oils, results showed also that the percentage of <b>oil</b> <b>trapped</b> in sinking OSAs increases rapidly from about 0. 5 % to about 30 % of the initial oil mass when sediment concentration increases from 25 to 100 mg/l. Further increase of sediment concentration to 300 mg/l showed slower increase of <b>oil</b> <b>trapping</b> to reach about 40 to 50 % {{depending on the type of}} oil. Measurements of the mass of sediment trapped in OSAs showed that the highest trapping efficiency is obtained when the sediment to oil ratio is close to 0. 5. This value decreases exponentially with oil density. ...|$|R
30|$|Adding {{nanoparticles}} to fluid greatly {{increases the}} mobility of <b>trapped</b> <b>oil,</b> reduces interfacial tension, changes the properties of fluid, wettability alteration [163]. Although, the exact mechanism for oil displacement using nanoparticles is still not clear [164, 165], nanotechnology {{has been seen as}} the alternative to recover the remaining <b>oil</b> <b>trapped</b> in the reservoir [166, 167].|$|R

50|$|Study of {{regional}} structure {{is important in}} understanding orogeny, plate tectonics and more specifically in the oil, gas and mineral exploration industries as structures such as faults, folds and unconformities are primary controls on ore mineralisation and <b>oil</b> <b>traps.</b>|$|R
30|$|Nanotechnology {{has also}} {{found its way}} to {{petroleum}} engineering, it is a well-accepted path in {{the oil and gas industry}} to recover more <b>oil</b> <b>trapped</b> in the reservoir, it has recorded success in reservoir characterization, drilling and well-completion jobs [5]. In EOR, nanoparticle is still in the laboratory stage where its efficiency is being studied. And few field trials have been reported [6]. Different laboratory studies [7, 8] and pilot field application have reported [6] that nanofluids can recover <b>oil</b> <b>trapped</b> in the reservoir. Therefore, nanoparticle can change the wettability of the rock surface, reduce interfacial tension between oil and water interface, and lower the chemical adsorption into the reservoir rock surface [9].|$|R
5000|$|Basin Inversion {{is caused}} by uplift and/or {{compression}} in this basin. The compression {{is caused by}} the toe detachment of the shale diapirs. Basin inversion forms anticline structures, which serve as a great <b>oil</b> <b>trap.</b> Clay smears in the sediments seal the formations so oil does not escape out.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. When {{oil spills}} {{in the coastal}} environment, the spilled oil may {{interact}} with the suspended particulate matter {{in the water column}} to form oil-SPM aggregates (OSAs). This process has been recognized to enhance natural cleansing of oiled shorelines. This laboratory study was conducted using SPM samples with different particle size distribution and mineral composition, two crude oil samples, filtered natural seawater, and a reciprocating shaker. The sediment-to-oil ratio was kept constant to 1 in all the experiments. The <b>oil</b> <b>trapped</b> in negatively buoyant OSAs was measured using an Infrared Oil Content Analyzer. Results showed that OSA formation increased with the decrease of the sediment size, the maximum <b>oil</b> <b>trapped</b> in settled OSAs was 182 mg oil / g sediment when OSAs were formed with kaolinite and CST 180 crude oil...|$|R
5000|$|In 2013 it was {{reported}} that a potentially very significant tight <b>oil</b> (<b>oil</b> <b>trapped</b> in oil-bearing shales) resource has been found near Coober Pedy in the Arckaringa Basin. [...] This resource is estimated to hold between [...] of oil, which provides the potential for Australia to become a net oil exporter.|$|R
30|$|Thus, the mixed-wet system {{significantly}} trapped smaller {{amount of}} residual oil compared to oil-wet system, {{which is consistent}} with Amott’s finding that extreme wettability results in high residual oil, whereas weakly water-wet conditions or slightly oil-wet conditions result in low residual oil. It may be that the mixed wet system <b>trapped</b> less residual <b>oil</b> {{as a result of the}} oil-wet solid surface that allows the oil blobs that are close to each other to connect and form a continuous flow path. As such, an oil-wet solid surface prevents water from forming a continuous thin film, and prevents snap-off. Likewise, the <b>oil</b> <b>trapped</b> in the smaller pores is reduced as compared to an oil-wet system, because the small pores in a mixed-wettability system are water-filled Anderson (1987). According to Anderson (1987), as compared to the water-wet system, the mixed-wet system <b>traps</b> less <b>oil</b> because it <b>traps</b> less <b>oil</b> in the larger oil-wet pores. However, in this experiment, there was no significant difference between the percent <b>oil</b> <b>trapping</b> in mixed-wet (16.39  %) and water-wet systems (17.72  %). The residual oil was as small as that of the water-wet system or perhaps even smaller, suggesting that global phase trapping in porous media (residual saturation) is sensitive to the wetting characteristics of the solid matrix. Moreover, the saturation history of oil might affect the amount of residual <b>oil</b> <b>trapped</b> after the water injection, as the amount of oil saturation of the acrylic bead packs (91.68  %) was higher than that of mixed-bead packs (85.92  %), resulting in higher residual oil saturation.|$|R
40|$|Previous oil {{containment}} booms have an {{open top}} that allows natural gas to escape, and have significant oil leakage due to wave action. Also, a subsea pyramid <b>oil</b> <b>trap</b> exists, but cannot move relative to moving oil plumes from deepsea oil leaks. The solution is to have large, moveable <b>oil</b> <b>traps.</b> One version floats on the sea surface and has a flexible tarp cover and a lower weighted skirt to completely entrap the floating oil and natural gas. The device must have at least three sides with boats pulling at each apex, and sonar or other system to track the slowly moving oil plume, so that the boats can properly locate the booms. The <b>oil</b> <b>trap</b> device must also have a means for removal of the oil and the natural gas. A second design version has a flexible pyramid cover that is attached by lines to ballast on the ocean floor. This is similar to fixed, metal pyramid oil capture devices in the Santa Barbara Channel {{off the coast of}} California. The ballast lines for the improved design, however, would have winches that can move the pyramid to always be located above the oil and gas plume. A third design is a combination of the first two. It uses a submerged pyramid to <b>trap</b> <b>oil,</b> but has no anchor and uses boats to locate the trap. It has ballast weights located along the bottom of the tarp and/or at the corners of the trap. The improved floating oil-spill containment device has a large floating boom and weighted skirt surrounding the oil and gas entrapment area. The device is triangular (or more than three sides) and has a flexible tarp cover with a raised gas vent area. Boats pull on the apex of the triangles to maintain tension and to allow the device to move to optimum locations to <b>trap</b> <b>oil</b> and gas. The gas is retrieved from a higher buoyant part of the tarp, and oil is retrieved from the floating oil layer contained in the device. These devices can be operated in relatively severe weather, since waves will break over the devices without causing oil leaking. Also, natural gas is entrapped and can be retrieved. All designs can use sonar to locate the moving oil plume, and then be relocated by using boats or winches to move the <b>oil</b> <b>trapping</b> devices. These devices can be constructed of treated, non-permeable DuPont Kevlar cloth (or similar material) ...|$|R

30|$|In some situations, {{chemical}} injection {{is also used}} in oil fields to enhance oil production by reducing the surface tension of the formation liquid. However, it is technologically complex to implement since it requires relatively complex and expensive equipment, {{though it may be}} a good alternative in case there is much <b>oil</b> <b>trapped</b> in the reservoir, within which the acid content is high.|$|R
30|$|A {{critical}} rate was noticed through this experimental study. Above the critical flow rate, higher injection rate adversely affects the displacement through fingering. However, {{it should be}} noted that increasing the flow rate up to the critical value is helpful because of the greater effect of viscous force to overcome the capillary force, which is known as the <b>oil</b> <b>trapping</b> force.|$|R

30|$|As it is {{observed}} in this, due to the high viscosity of polymer solution comparing to water injection which was shown before in Fig. 8, there is less residual <b>oil</b> <b>trapped</b> {{in the corners of}} pores and specifically in throats leading to a better displacement efficiency with minimum oil-bypassing during the injection. This figure shows the efficiency of polymer flooding in systems with more realistic flow patterns.|$|R
30|$|Oil {{displacement}} {{efficiency is}} {{the combination of the}} macroscopic efficiency and the microscopic efficiency. Macroscopic efficiency is the volumetric effect of the displacing fluid(s) in contacting oil zone, while microscopic displacement uses capillary forces to effectively mobile <b>oil</b> <b>trapped</b> at pore scale. Therefore, the purpose of oil displacement during polymer flooding is to improve the macroscopic and microscopic displacement efficiency to improve oil recovery (Romero-Zeron 2012).|$|R
30|$|Four typical {{types of}} {{residual}} <b>oil,</b> residual <b>oil</b> <b>trapped</b> in dead ends, oil ganglia in pore throats, oil at pore corners and oil film adhered to pore walls, were studied. According to main pore structure characteristics and the fundamental morphological features of residual oil, four displacement models for residual oil were proposed, in which pore-scale flow behavior of viscoelastic fluid was analyzed by a numerical method and micro-mechanisms for mobilization of residual oil were discussed. Calculated {{results indicate that}} the viscoelastic effect enhances micro displacement efficiency and increases swept volume. For residual <b>oil</b> <b>trapped</b> in dead ends, the flow field of viscoelastic fluid is developed in dead ends more deeply, resulting in more contact with oil by the displacing fluid, and consequently increasing swept volume. In addition, intense viscoelastic vortex has great stress, under which residual oil becomes small oil ganglia, and finally be carried into main channels. For residual oil at pore throats, its displacement mechanisms are similar to the <b>oil</b> <b>trapped</b> in dead ends. Vortices are developed {{in the depths of the}} throats and oil ganglia become smaller. Besides, viscoelastic fluid causes higher pressure drop on oil ganglia, as a driving force, which can overcome capillary force, consequently, flow direction can be changed and the displacing fluid enter smaller throats. For oil at pore corners, viscoelastic fluid can enhance displacement efficiency as a result of greater velocity and stress near the corners. For residual oil adhered to pore wall, viscoelastic fluid can provide a greater displacing force on the interface between viscoelastic fluid and oil, thus, making it easier to exceed the minimum interfacial tension for mobilizing the oil film.|$|R

As development increases, the potential for accidental oil spills in the arctic marine environment increases.

50|$|Microbial {{enhanced}} oil recovery, specifically, has received special attention. In 1999, Bognolo reported that biosurfactants not only reduced the viscosity of the Venezuelan heavy crude oils, but also increased their mobility in transport lines. Currently, the biodegradation {{of the heavy}} crudes has become an integral tertiary recovery method in the field, {{as it is a}} cost-efficient and eco-friendly way to drive the residual <b>oil</b> <b>trapped</b> in the reservoirs.|$|R
50|$|Naturally, a {{malfunctioning}} and/or misused {{deep fryer}} poses a serious fire risk, especially with gas-powered deep fryers. Furthermore, putting water on oil fires {{will cause a}} fire boilover and aggravate the situation. There are special fire extinguishers and hood-based fire suppression systems for food oil fires, often using alkaline chemicals such as potassium citrate and potassium acetate that react with the <b>oils,</b> <b>trap</b> the steam and vapors, and thus suppress the fire by saponification.|$|R
30|$|The Hamaca {{field is}} located in Venezuela’s Orinoco heavy oil belt and is a huge stratigraphic trap on the {{southern}} flank of the Oriente basin. The Hamaca concession area, which covers 160, 000 acres, contains <b>oil</b> <b>trapped</b> in shallow fluvial–deltaic reservoirs of the Oficina Formation (Miocene age). Sandstone reservoirs of the Oficina Formation at Hamaca were generally deposited in a bedload-dominated, fluvial–deltaic environment. Hamaca crude is considered “foamy” and is generally saturated with gas at reservoir conditions.|$|R
40|$|When {{developing}} {{offshore oil}} fields most wells are dual completions; i. e., two <b>oil</b> <b>traps</b> (targets) are produced together through a single hole. This problem is discussed {{and a model}} is developed for finding the pairing of targets {{in order to minimize}} the total drilling cost. The mathematical formulation of this problem {{turns out to be the}} well known "symmetric assignment problem" (or "matching problem"). Algorithms for the solution of these problems are discussed and computational results are presented. ...|$|R
50|$|A {{petroleum}} geologist is an earth {{scientist who}} works in the field of petroleum geology, which involves all aspects of oil discovery and production. Petroleum geologists are usually linked to the actual discovery of oil and the identification of possible oil deposits or leads. It can be a very labor-intensive task involving several different fields of science and elaborate equipment. Petroleum geologists look at the structural and sedimentary aspects of the stratum/strata to identify possible <b>oil</b> <b>traps.</b>|$|R
30|$|This type of {{interactions}} in porous media {{is governed by}} the interplay between capillary, viscous and gravitational forces. <b>Oil</b> <b>trapping</b> during immiscible displacement in porous media is {{mainly because of the}} capillary forces. The <b>trapped</b> <b>oil</b> can be recovered if the amount of viscous or gravity forces acting on the <b>trapped</b> <b>oil</b> exceeds the capillary forces. The relative contribution of gravity and capillary forces on S or is determined by the bond number (N B), which is a dimensionless number representing the ratio of gravity to capillary forces (Du Prey 1978). The relative contribution of viscous forces and capillary forces on S or is determined by the capillary number (N C), which is a dimensionless number that determines the relative contribution of viscous and capillary forces (Taber 1969; Stegemeier 1977, Lake 1989). A number of different mathematical relations between N B and N C have been proposed by various researchers (Cense and Berg 2009).|$|R

This study is focused on the petrological characteristics, sedimentary petrofacies types, logging facies models and in-plane facies characteristics of the X–XII sand group of the K 2 qn 3 Formation in the Daqingzijing area of the Songliao Basin, China. This study provides a geological basis for the description of a single sand body and its remaining <b>oil</b> <b>trapping</b> potential.|$|R
50|$|Texas is {{approximately}} bisected {{by a series}} of faults that trend southwest to northeast across the state, from the area of Uvalde to Texarkana. South and east of these faults, the surface exposures consist mostly of Cenozoic sandstone and shale strata that grow progressively younger toward the coast, indicative of a regression that has continued from the late Mesozoic to the present. The coastal plain is underlaid by salt domes that are responsible for many of the <b>oil</b> <b>traps</b> in the region.|$|R
30|$|Due to {{the current}} decline in {{conventional}} oil reserves, the commodity prices are increasing globally. As a result, oil industry has turned its attention to production techniques for known heavy oil deposits to solve this problem. Viscous <b>oil</b> <b>trapped</b> in carbonates (over 1.6 trillion bbl) {{is perceived as a}} huge potential resource for future energy supply which needs application of new technologies. While steam injection in sandstone reservoirs is known as a successful technology, there is a limited study on this process in fractured reservoirs.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{consider}} the one-dimensional degenerate two-phase flow equations {{as a model}} for water-drive in oil recovery. The effect of <b>oil</b> <b>trapping</b> is observed in strongly heterogeneous materials with large vari-ations in the permeabilities and in the capillary pressure curves. In such materials, a vanishing oil saturation may appear at interior interfaces and inhibit the oil recovery. We introduce a free boundary problem that separates a critical region with locally vanishing permeabilities from a strictly parabolic region and give a rigorous derivation of the effective conservation law...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} {{of a helicopter}} transmission planetary stage was studied both experimentally and analytically. Experiments were done by using a back-to-back, test-and-slave arrangement. The experiments were a parametric study {{of the effects of}} operating conditions on efficiency. In order to enhance the analysis, a model was developed that calculates the power required for the meshing gears to displace <b>oil</b> <b>trapped</b> between the gear teeth. In general, the analysis predicted higher efficiencies than were measured. The results of this study were compared with those of other studies...|$|R
50|$|Great source: {{but nothing}} to <b>trap</b> <b>oil.</b>|$|R
30|$|This {{effect has}} been further {{investigated}} through numerical simulation of polymer flooding over dead ends (Yin et al. 2006, 2012; Xia et al. 2008 a, b; Zhang and Yue 2008). The pulling effect also works for residual <b>oil</b> <b>trapped</b> in a configuration that have both ends open to flow. This type of residual oil is immovable {{mainly because of}} capillary forces. In this case, {{there is at least}} a 50  % chance that the capillary force retaining the oil droplet can be reduced by the pulling effect (Wang et al. 2000).|$|R
30|$|Nowadays, the {{interest}} in using LSW flooding to improve oil recovery has intensified, but no specific mechanism has been proposed yet. Some researchers such as Tang and Morrow (1997) have shown that oil/water relative permeability changes through LSW injection processes and rock wetting condition {{tends to be more}} water wet; therefore, oil relative permeability increases at a given water saturation, which causes less <b>oil</b> <b>trapping</b> in pore structures. However, the complexity of mineral, oil and aqueous-phase compositions create severe conditions for interpreting the reasons of this phenomenon (Atthawutthisin 2012).|$|R
