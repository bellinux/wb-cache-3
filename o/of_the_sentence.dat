5|$|English {{word order}} {{has moved from}} the Germanic verb-second (V2) word order to being almost {{exclusively}} subject–verb–object (SVO). The combination of SVO order and use of auxiliary verbs often creates clusters {{of two or more}} verbs at the centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sentence,</b> such as he had hoped to try to open it.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, the Marquess {{was imprisoned}} {{for a year}} in Jersey for cocaine {{possession}} and trafficking; a contemporary report said he was spending around £25,000 {{a year on the}} drug. He served seven months <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sentence</b> and was released in April 1989.|$|E

5|$|The prose, while simple at {{the level}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sentence</b> (and we can safely assume that Hofmann's {{translation}} is very faithful to the original), is shifty, blurred, {{to the point where}} at times we are left unsure as to what exactly is going on – a deliberate flight from causation, quite understandable in a country where everyone (even, we learn, the horses) has been driven mad by fear.|$|E
5|$|The second {{five years}} {{were to be}} served {{concurrently}} with the eight- to twelve-year sentence, with a possibility of parole after five years.

She was sentenced on August 21 to 35 years in prison, reduction in rank to private (private E-1 or PVT), forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and a dishonorable discharge. She was given credit for 1,293 days of pretrial confinement, including 112 days for her treatment at Quantico, and would have been eligible for parole after serving one-third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sentence.</b> She was confined at the United States Disciplinary Barracks (USDB) at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.|$|E

Šišić was subsequently arrested in Hungary in 2001 and extradited to Italy, where he was tried, {{convicted and sentenced to}} 15 years in prison. In 2006, he was turned over to Serbia for the remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sentence,</b> but released in 2008. Two other Yugoslav officers were tried in absentia in Italy and convicted in 2013, while Serbia was ordered to pay monetary damages to the victims' families.

5|$|While English is a subject-prominent language, at the {{discourse}} level {{it tends to}} use a topic-comment structure, where the known information (topic) precedes the new information (comment). Because of the strict SVO syntax, the topic of a sentence generally {{has to be the}} grammatical subject <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sentence.</b> In cases where the topic is not the grammatical subject <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sentence,</b> frequently the topic is promoted to subject position through syntactic means. One way of doing this is through a passive construction, the girl was stung by the bee. Another way is through a cleft sentence where the main clause is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula sentence with a dummy subject such as it or there, e.g. it was the girl that the bee stung, there was a girl who was stung by a bee. Dummy subjects are also used in constructions where there is no grammatical subject such as with impersonal verbs (e.g., it is raining) or in existential clauses (there are many cars on the street). Through the use of these complex sentence constructions with informationally vacuous subjects, English is able to maintain both a topic-comment sentence structure and a SVO syntax.|$|E

5|$|After {{completing}} the first 15 years <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sentence,</b> Lebrón's social worker {{told her that}} she could ask for parole, but she did not display interest in the proposal, never signing the required documentation. Due to this lack of interest, she was mandated to attend a meeting before a penitentiary committee, where she presented a written deposition expressing her position about the parole proposal as well as other subjects including terrorism, politics and the United States' use of the atomic bomb. Following this the other inmates reacted with skepticism over her intentions to refuse the offer, which made her distance herself from them and focus her attention in studying as well as writing poetry. During this timeframe, Lebrón's interest in religion grew. Lebrón's daughter Gladys died in 1977, while her mother was in prison.|$|E
5|$|Both yes–no {{questions}} and wh-questions in English are mostly formed using subject–auxiliary inversion (Am I going tomorrow?, Where can we eat?), which may require do-support (Do you like her?, Where did he go?). In most cases, interrogative words (wh-words; e.g. what, who, where, when, why, how) {{appear in a}} fronted position. For example, in the question What did you see?, the word what appears as the first constituent despite being the grammatical object <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sentence.</b> (When the wh-word is the subject or forms part of the subject, no inversion occurs: Who saw the cat?.) Prepositional phrases can also be fronted when they are the question's theme, e.g. To whose house did you go last night?. The personal interrogative pronoun who is the only interrogative pronoun to still show inflection for case, with the variant whom serving as the objective case form, although this form may be going out of use in many contexts.|$|E
