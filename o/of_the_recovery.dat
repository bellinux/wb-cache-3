In addition, police personnel from the mainland were transferred to Svalbard to work with the investigation and recovery. The work was supplemented by local volunteers. Because of the bad weather, which included fog and snow, it was often impossible to transport workers to the plateau, and work therefore started in the valley.|$|E
5|$|A {{key part}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Recovery</b> Plan is the {{supplementary}} feeding of females. The kakapo breeds {{only once every}} two to five years, when {{a certain type of}} plant species, primarily Dacrydium cupressinum (rimu), produces protein-rich fruit and seeds. Observations of the relationship between intermittent breeding and the plant's mast year help biologists choose which suitable supplementary foods to increase kakapo breeding frequency. In 1989, six preferred foods (apples, sweet potatoes, almonds, Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds and walnuts) were supplied ad libitum each night to 12 feeding stations. Males and females ate the supplied foods, and females nested on Little Barrier Island in the summers of 1989–91 {{for the first time since}} 1982, although nesting success was low.|$|E
5|$|Roughly a {{month after}} the storm, a benefit concert was held in St. John's. The concert raised about $400,000 (2010CAD) toward storm relief in one night. In late October, the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador {{allocated}} $275,000 in funds for 200workers who lost their jobs after two fish processing plants were damaged in Marystown and Port Union. However, union leaders claimed that the assistance was insufficient and accounted for just 420 of 600work hours. Following {{more than a year of}} discussions, the plant's parent company, Ocean Choice International, decided to permanently shut down operations on December2, 2011. Numerous insurance claims, reaching $65million by early November, were made following Hurricane Igor's landfall Over the course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recovery</b> phase, several complaints, including concerns lodged by church ministers, that relief funds for victims of the storm were not being distributed fast enough and the overall process was taking too long. Roughly ten months after the hurricane, work on permanent reconstruction of roadways began in several areas across the Burin Peninsula. By January 24, 2011, The Salvation Army received about $1.6million worth of donations for residents affected by Hurricane Igor, roughly half of which had been distributed at that point. An additional $200,000 had been pledged by donors.|$|E

5|$|To {{summarize}} {{and conclude}} upon this point: Section 3 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Recovery</b> Act (15 USCA 703) is without precedent. It supplies no standards for any trade, industry, or activity. It does not undertake to prescribe {{rules of conduct}} {{to be applied to}} particular states of fact determined by appropriate administrative procedure. Instead of prescribing rules of conduct, it authorizes the making of codes to prescribe them. For that legislative undertaking, section 3 sets up no standards, aside from the statement of the general aims of rehabilitation, correction, and expansion described in section 1. In view of the scope of that broad declaration and {{of the nature of the}} few restrictions that are imposed, the discretion of the President in approving or prescribing codes, and thus enacting laws for the government of trade and industry throughout the country, is virtually unfettered. We think that the code-making authority thus conferred is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An {{evolutionary}} game model between manufacturers {{is established}} to study <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> government incentive measures for <b>the</b> EOL product <b>recovery</b> based on <b>the</b> assumption that all manufacturers have bounded rationality. Analysis on stable state {{shows that the}} evolutionary stable state does not always exist in the model. On <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> this analysis, a system dynamics model is established to analyze <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lowest <b>recovery</b> ratio and <b>the</b> fixed reward on <b>the</b> <b>recovery</b> behaviors <b>of</b> manufacturers by simulation. Simulation results illustrate that there exists a reasonable range <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lowest <b>recovery</b> ratio within which government incentive measures work well and the fixed reward can expand <b>the</b> width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reasonable range. Any above or below <b>the</b> reasonable range <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lowest <b>recovery</b> ratio will invalidate government incentive measures.

25|$|Normally, {{the face}} is in the water during front crawl with eyes looking at {{the lower part of}} the wall in front of the pool, with the {{waterline}} between the brow line and the hairline. Breaths are taken through the mouth by turning the head to the side of a recovering arm at the beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recovery,</b> and breathing in the triangle between the upper arm, lower arm, and the waterline. The swimmer's forward movement will cause a bow wave with a trough in the water surface near the ears. After turning the head, a breath can be taken in this trough without the need to move the mouth above the average water surface. A thin film of water running down the head can be blown away just before the intake. The head is rotated back at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recovery</b> and points down and forward again when the recovered hand enters the water. The swimmer breathes out through mouth and nose until the next breath. Breathing out through the nose may help to prevent water from entering the nose. Swimmers with allergies exacerbated by time in the pool should not expect exhaling through the nose to completely prevent intranasal irritation.|$|E
