40|$|Due to the incomprehensive and {{inconsistent}} description of {{spatial and temporal}} information for city data observed by sensors in various fields, {{it is a great}} challenge to share the massive, multi-source and heterogeneous interdisciplinary instant <b>point</b> <b>observation</b> data resources. In this paper, a spatio-temporal enhanced metadata model for <b>point</b> <b>observation</b> data sharing was proposed. The proposed Data Meta-Model (DMM) focused on the spatio-temporal characteristics and formulated a ten-tuple information description structure to provide a unified and spatio-temporal enhanced description of the <b>point</b> <b>observation</b> data. To verify the feasibility of the <b>point</b> <b>observation</b> data sharing based on DMM, a prototype system was established, and the performance improvement of Sensor Observation Service (SOS) for the instant access and insertion of <b>point</b> <b>observation</b> data was realized through the proposed MongoSOS, which is a Not Only SQL (NoSQL) SOS based on the MongoDB database and has the capability of distributed storage. For example, the response time of the access and insertion for navigation and positioning data can be realized at the millisecond level. Case studies were conducted, including the gas concentrations monitoring for the gas leak emergency response and the smart city public vehicle monitoring based on BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) used for recording the dynamic observation information. The results demonstrated the versatility and extensibility of the DMM, and the spatio-temporal enhanced sharing for interdisciplinary instant <b>point</b> <b>observations</b> in smart cities...|$|R

While its spectrum was one of the softest observed from an AGN during the ROSAT All-Sky Survey, its spectrum was found to be dramatically harder during a <b>pointed</b> <b>observation</b> although the count rate remained constant. In the <b>pointed</b> <b>observation</b> we found that the spectrum is softer when it is fainter, and spectral fitting demonstrates that it is the hard component that is variable. The ASCA observation confirms the presence of a hard X-ray power law, the slope of which is rather flat compared with other NLS 1 s. Survey and follow-up radio observations reveal that RX J 0134. 2 - 4258 is also unusual in that it {{is a member of the}} rare class of radio-loud NLS 1 s, and, with R= 71, it holds the current record for the largest radio-to-optical ratio in NLS 1 s.

The design is based upon a relational database model that exposes each single observation as a record, taking advantage of the capability in relational database systems for querying based upon data values and enabling cross dimension data retrieval and analysis.

50|$|Changes in the Walker {{circulation}} {{with time}} occur {{in conjunction with}} changes in surface temperature. Some of these changes are forced externally, such as the seasonal shift of the sun into the Northern Hemisphere in summer. Other changes {{appear to be the}} result of coupled ocean-atmosphere feedback in which, for example, easterly winds cause the sea surface temperature to fall in the east, enhancing the zonal heat contrast and hence intensifying easterly winds across the basin. These anomalous easterlies induce more equatorial upwelling and raise the thermocline in the east, amplifying the initial cooling by the southerlies. This coupled ocean-atmosphere feedback was originally proposed by Bjerknes. From an <b>oceanographic</b> <b>point</b> of view, the equatorial cold tongue is caused by easterly winds. Were the Earth climate symmetric about the equator, cross-equatorial wind would vanish, and the cold tongue would be much weaker and have a very different zonal structure than is observed today.|$|R
