5|$|Deeper (average: 3m) {{and much}} wider (av. 10m) {{perimeter}} ditches (fossae). These would have flat floors {{rather than the}} traditional V-shape. Such ditches would {{make it difficult to}} bring siege equipment (ladders, rams, and <b>other</b> <b>engines)</b> to the walls. It would also concentrate attackers in an enclosed area where they would be exposed to missile fire from the walls.|$|E
5|$|In a follow-up, to meet Specification O.21/44 for a two-seat strike fighter, the Spearfish was {{redesigned}} {{to accommodate}} a twin-coupled Rolls-Royce Merlin engine and contra-rotating propellers. A variety of <b>other</b> <b>engines</b> were considered and although a production order was placed for three examples in 1944, the programme was eventually shelved, remaining as an unfulfilled paper project.|$|E
5|$|To {{provide the}} desired performance, several {{features}} {{were used in}} the RB.199. To operate efficiently across a wide range of conditions and speeds up to Mach 2, the RB.199 and several <b>other</b> <b>engines</b> make use of variable intake ramps to control the air flow. The hydraulic system is pressurised by syphoning power from both or either operational engine; the hydraulics are completely contained within the airframe rather than integrating with the engine to improve safety and maintainability. In case of double-engine, or double-generator, failure, the Tornado has a single-use battery capable of operating the fuel pump and hydraulics for up to 13 minutes.|$|E

5|$|While {{this was}} happening, Philip {{attacked}} and occupied the cities in Thrace which still belonged to Ptolemy, Maroneia, Cypsela, Doriscos, Serrheum and Aemus. The Macedonians then advanced on the Thracian Chersonese where they captured {{the cities of}} Perinthus, Sestos, Elaeus, Alopeconnesus, Callipolis and Madytus. Philip then descended {{to the city of}} Abydos, which was held by a combined Pergamese and Rhodian garrison. Philip started the siege by blockading the city by land and sea to stop attempts to reinforce or supply the city. The Abydenians, full of confidence, dislodged some of the siege engines with their own catapults while some of Philip's <b>other</b> <b>engines</b> were burnt by the defenders. With their siege weaponry in tatters, the Macedonians started undermining the city's walls, eventually succeeding in collapsing the outer wall.|$|E

50|$|Inherent safety: Because a bell-type expander-cycle {{engine is}} thrust limited, it {{can easily be}} {{designed}} to withstand its maximum thrust conditions. In <b>other</b> <b>engine</b> types, a stuck fuel valve or similar problem can lead to engine thrust spiraling out of control due to unintended feedback systems. <b>Other</b> <b>engine</b> types require complex mechanical or electronic controllers to ensure this does not happen. Expander cycles are by design incapable of malfunctioning that way.|$|R
5000|$|As {{with single}} engined aircraft, {{situations}} where the aircraft is at high power and has a high angle of attack (such as take off) will cause a slight, but noticeable yawing motion. The engine with the down-moving blades towards the wingtip produces more yaw and roll than the <b>other</b> <b>engine,</b> because the moment (arm) of that engine's thrust about the aircraft center of gravity is greater. Thus, the engine with down-moving blades towards the fuselage will be [...] "critical", because its failure and the associated reliance on the <b>other</b> <b>engine</b> will require a larger rudder deflection by the pilot to maintain straight flight than if the <b>other</b> <b>engine</b> had failed. For most aircraft (which have clockwise rotating propellers), this is the left engine.|$|R

25|$|Production Camels were {{powered by}} various rotary engines, most {{commonly}} either the Clerget 9B or the Bentley BR1. In order to evade a potential manufacturing bottleneck being imposed upon the overall {{aircraft in the}} event of an engine shortage, several <b>other</b> <b>engines</b> were also adopted to power the type as well.|$|E
25|$|Compression {{ignition}} Diesel engines {{ignite the}} fuel-air mixture {{by the heat}} of compression and do not need a spark. They usually have glowplugs that preheat the combustion chamber to allow starting in cold weather. <b>Other</b> <b>engines</b> may use a flame, or a heated tube, for ignition. While this was common for very early engines it is now rare.|$|E
25|$|The Vildebeest {{was ordered}} by the Spanish Republic in 1932 and licence {{production}} of 25 Vildebeest for the Spanish Republican Navy was undertaken in Spain by CASA most receiving the Hispano-Suiza HS 600 inline engine, though some <b>other</b> <b>engines</b> were also used.

25|$|The {{heat source}} may be {{provided}} by the combustion of a fuel and, since the combustion products do not mix with the working fluid and hence do not {{come into contact with}} the internal parts of the engine, a Stirling engine can run on fuels that would damage <b>other</b> <b>engines</b> types' internals, such as landfill gas, which may contain siloxane which can deposit abrasive silicon dioxide in conventional engines.|$|E
25|$|New grilles {{and wider}} and lower {{taillights}} {{were among the}} appearance changes for the 1984 Buick LeSabre, still offered in Custom and Limited models. The 252 V6 was dropped from the option list but all <b>other</b> <b>engines</b> returned including the 231 V6 (standard on coupes and sedans), or optional Oldsmobile 307 gasoline V8 (standard on wagons, optional on sedans and coupes) and Oldsmobile 350 Diesel V8 (optional all models).|$|E
25|$|In {{conjunction}} with Parker Hannifin, MPC Products of Skokie, Illinois designed a fly-by-wire technology mechanical control suite for the 717 flight deck. The modules replaced much cumbersome rigging {{that had occurred}} in previous DC-9/MD-80 aircraft. The Rolls-Royce BR715 engines are completely controlled by an electronic engine system (FADEC— Full Authority Digital Engine Control) developed by BAE Systems, offering improved controllability and optimization. The engine has significantly lower fuel consumption compared to <b>other</b> <b>engines</b> of the equivalent amount of thrust.|$|E

25|$|The Wairarapa railcars {{hold the}} fastest speeds for {{operations}} over the Rimutaka Incline. Passenger services were previously slow trains {{operated by the}} H class locomotives specially built to operate on the Fell mountain railway system employed on the Incline. The Wairarapa railcars were designed to operate unaided on the Incline, and as they were lighter and more nimble, they achieved speeds well in excess of any service operated by an H class (or any of the few <b>other</b> <b>engines</b> occasionally permitted {{to work on the}} Incline).|$|E
25|$|Developed as {{a private}} venture by DFW, {{it was a large}} biplane of {{conventional}} configuration with four engines mounted inside the fuselage, powering propellers on the wings via transmission shafts - two mounted tractor-fashion on {{the leading edge of the}} upper wing, and two mounted pusher-fashion on the trailing edge of the lower wing. The DFW R.I was unique, among the Riesenflugzeuge with internally mounted engines, in that each engine drove a separate propeller and was not connected to the <b>other</b> <b>engines</b> or propellers.|$|E
25|$|In some engines, {{bleed air}} is also tapped to provide power for accessories, {{as well as}} a {{mechanical}} shaft drive. Bleed air is particularly useful when a source of compressed air is specifically needed, either to pressurise cabin air, or as a supply of cooling air to other components (to avoid excess heat, this is taken for a low-pressure tapping, or from the LP compressor of a two-shaft engine). One important use for bleed air is for cross-starting of <b>other</b> <b>engines</b> in a multi-engine aircraft.|$|E
50|$|The one train {{per week}} freight service, {{introduced}} in 1963, was scheduled so that locomotives did not stable at Willunga overnight and consequently, tenders were called for demolition of the employee's barracks and <b>other</b> <b>engine</b> facilities.|$|R
