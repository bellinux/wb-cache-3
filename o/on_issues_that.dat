5|$|Members of {{the public}} take part in Parliament in two ways that are not the case at Westminster: a public petitioning system, and cross-party groups on policy topics which the {{interested}} public join and attend meetings of, alongside MSPs.

5|$|Parker's long {{service on}} the bench {{proved to be an}} {{advantage}} in his nomination, as he had avoided taking stands <b>on</b> <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> divided the party, particularly that of currency standards. Hill and other Parker supporters remained deliberately silent on their candidate's beliefs. By the time the convention cast their votes, it was clear that no candidate but Parker could unify the party, and he was selected on the first ballot. Henry G. Davis, an elderly West Virginia millionaire and former senator, was selected as the vice presidential candidate in the hope that he would partially finance Parker's campaign.|$|E

25|$|The Court’s {{decision}} to qualify speech protection in Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist.

Souter wrote that the need to balance these competing needs hardly disappears when the employee happens to speak <b>on</b> <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> his job requires him to address.

25|$|Ashdown {{retired as}} leader in 1999 {{and the party}} elected Charles Kennedy as his replacement. The party {{improved}} on their 1997 results at the 2001 general election, increasing their number of seats to 52 and {{their share of the}} vote to 18.3%. Liberal Democrat candidates won support from former Labour and Conservative voters due to the Lib Dems' position <b>on</b> <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> appealed to those on the left and the right: opposition to the war in Iraq and support for civil liberties, electoral reform, and open government. Charles Kennedy expressed his goal to replace the Conservatives as the official opposition; The Spectator awarded him the 'Parliamentarian of the Year' award in November 2004 for his position on the war. The party won seats from Labour in by-elections in Brent East in 2003 and Leicester South in 2004, and narrowly missed taking others in Birmingham Hodge Hill and Hartlepool.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of the primary election, Combs {{publicly}} challenged Stephenson to a debate, to be televised on Kentucky Educational Television. Stephenson declined, citing a state judicial code forbidding candidates for judicial offices to discuss positions <b>on</b> <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> might come before them if elected. Combs maintained that this code violated the state constitution and the federal Constitution and refused to abide by it. He charged that Stephenson had too often sided with wealthy litigants over poorer ones including denying compensation to injured workers and upholding prohibitions on felons owning firearms, which Combs said violated the Second Amendment. Following an investigation, the Kentucky Judicial Retirement and Removal Commission ordered him suspended from the bench for three months without pay for violating the code in February 1990. Combs appealed on grounds that the code abridged his First Amendment right to free speech. The suspension was not carried out pending the outcome of Combs' appeal, and it was overturned in a case that ultimately was affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court.|$|E
