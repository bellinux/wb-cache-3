5|$|At first, St. Leger {{tried to}} intimidate the fort's {{occupants}} by parading his troops—including the Indians in their war dress—in {{front of the}} fort. When this failed he sent a truce flag bearing a proclamation authored by General Burgoyne; Gansevoort refused to respond. St. Leger then began siege operations, encamping the regulars and artillery <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> rise north of the fort, {{and most of the}} Indians and Loyalists to its south, with a picket line of Indian encampments along the Mohawk River.|$|E

5|$|Didsbury derives {{its name}} from the Anglo-Saxon Dyddi's burg, {{probably}} referring to a man known as Dyddi whose stronghold or township it was <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> cliff overlooking a place where the River Mersey could be forded. In the 13th century Didsbury was variously referred to as Dydesbyre, Dydesbiri, Didsbury or Dodesbury.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Infogrames {{released}} Atari Anniversary Edition for the Sega Dreamcast, PlayStation, and PC compatibles. Developed by Digital Eclipse, {{it included}} emulated versions of Asteroids and other old Atari games. Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot criticized the Dreamcast version for its limitations, {{such as the}} presentation of vector graphics <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> resolution television set, which obscures the copyright text in Asteroids. The arcade and Atari 2600 versions of Asteroids, along with Asteroids Deluxe, were included in Atari Anthology for both Xbox and PlayStation 2.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the closure}} of the {{railways}} the railway land in the centre of the town stood empty for many years. Most prominent was a green space between the museum and brook which housed a dis-used pit wheel <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> steel frame, which many passers-by mistook for a spinning wheel. There had long been an aspiration to develop a memorial park or garden on the site to commemorate both the mining history of the town and to provide a new setting for the town's war memorial.|$|E
5|$|The short {{instrumental}} introduction {{is based}} on a pedal point sustained for several measures, reminiscent of pedal points in funeral music by Schütz and Bach, in Mozart's Requiem in the same key of D minor, and in Reger's previous Latin Requiem.

One or two people are required to stir it continuously with wooden paddles throughout its preparation. For home-made Hyderabadi haleem, a Ghotni (a wooden hand masher) is used to stir it until it reaches a sticky-smooth consistency, similar to minced meat.|$|E
5|$|When {{originally}} made, Psycho {{was seen}} as a departure from Hitchcock's previous film North by Northwest, having been filmed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> budget, with a television crew and in black and white. The film initially received mixed reviews, but outstanding box office returns prompted reconsideration which led to overwhelming critical acclaim and four Academy Award nominations, including Best Supporting Actress for Leigh and Best Director for Hitchcock.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a career}} high in {{appearances}} in 2004, Rivera did not throw during the offseason, unlike previous years. His 2005 season began <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> note. After missing time {{in spring training}} with elbow bursitis, he blew his first two save opportunities of the season against the Red Sox, marking four consecutive blown opportunities against Boston {{dating back to the}} previous postseason. Fans at Yankee Stadium booed Rivera, and baseball journalists speculated if his days as a dominant pitcher were over. He was subsequently cheered by Red Sox fans during pre-game introductions at Fenway Park the following week, in recognition of his struggles against the Red Sox. He responded to the ovation {{with a sense of humor}} by tipping his cap to the crowd.|$|E

5|$|In {{preparation}} {{for his second}} film, Enam Djam di Jogja (Six Hours in Yogyakarta), Ismail recalled Djajakusuma to Jakarta. For the film, Djajakusuma helped Ismail adapt the General Assault of 1 March 1949 for the screen. Production was completed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> budget; Djajakusuma later recalled that their camera had to be powered by a car battery. Despite this and other difficulties, Djajakusuma stayed on after the film's completion, completing another work for Perfini, Dosa Tak Berampun (Unforgivable Sin), later that year. Ismail served as director for this film, {{about a man who}} leaves his family after he is transfixed by the smile of a waitress.|$|E
5|$|Predators {{may include}} beetles and sciomyzid fly larvae, {{many of which}} {{specialize}} in feeding upon snails. Other potential predators may include the northern two-lined salamander (Eurycea bislineata), northern dusky salamander (Desmognathus fuscus), and Allegheny Mountain dusky salamander (Desmognathus ochrophaeus), which are common in the talus and on the ledges, as well as various small mammals or passerine birds such as robins and pigeons, which are often seen {{in or near the}} habitat. Although predation {{does not appear to be}} a limiting factor at this time, its potential impact <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> or stressed population is unclear. The 1978 listing rule included predation by the introduced European snails, Discus rotundatus and Oxychilus spp. as serious threats to Novisuccinea chittenangoensis. Little is currently known about this relationship.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} by the Japanese video game developer KID. It was made <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> budget, which led to the decision to make the low-cost video scenes of actor Mike Butters drinking Pepsi. The game also uses 3D event scenes, which were modeled by Kotaro Uchikoshi, who would later be a scenario writer for visual novels at KID. This was Uchikoshi's first job; he had been hired to plan video game adaptations of board games, but ended up being part of the development of Pepsiman instead, which was already in progress when he joined KID in 1998. The game was released in Japan by KID for the PlayStation on March 4, 1999; while an American publisher was looking into acquiring the rights to publish the game in the United States, it remained Japan-exclusive. Despite this, the game is entirely in English, not Japanese. According to Uchikoshi, the game did not sell well.|$|E

5|$|Thomas's new castle {{adapted the}} {{existing}} manor complex overlooking {{the head of}} the River Frome. Although the castle sat <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> spur it was overlooked by higher ground from the west and the north and was not ideally placed from a purely defensive perspective. Contemporary castle designs included the construction of huge, palatial tower keeps and apartments for the most powerful nobles, such as Kenilworth, expanded by Thomas's patron, John of Gaunt; or the construction of smaller, French influenced castles such as that seen at nearby Nunney Castle, built by one of Thomas's fellow nouveau riche landowners. By contrast, Farleigh Hungerford drew on the tradition of quadrangular castles that had begun in France during the early 13th century, in which the traditional buildings of an unfortified manor were enclosed by a four-sided outer wall and protected with corner towers. The style was well established by the late 14th century, even slightly old fashioned.|$|E
5|$|Various studios {{rejected}} the project, until Glimcher persuaded Tom Pollock, chairman of Universal Studios, to financially back the film <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> budget. Before production could begin however, Pollock insisted that footage {{from the television}} series I Love Lucy be {{a key part of}} the film. Following Lucille Ball's death in 1989, Glimcher was unable to secure the rights to use footage for the film. After Universal cancelled production of The Mambo Kings, the project moved to Warner Bros. Glimcher met with the studio's president Terry Semel, who introduced him to producer Arnon Milchan. Milchan agreed to co-finance the film through his production company Regency Enterprises and the French-based film studio Le Studio Canal+. The film was allocated a budget of $15.5 million.|$|E

First shown at the Cannes Film Festival on 17 May 2004 and released in its home countries later that year, The Edukators was praised by critics and audiences. It grossed more than $8million worldwide and received a number of awards and nominations. It did, however, receive criticism mainly for its political statements and also for its long running time.|$|E
