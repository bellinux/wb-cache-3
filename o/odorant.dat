40|$|Three {{kinds of}} liposomes {{prepared}} from phosphatidylcholine (PC), azolectin, and azolectin-containing membrane proteins of the canine erythrocytes {{were used as}} models for olfactory cells. To explore properties of the adsorption sites of <b>odorants,</b> membrane fluidity changes in response to various <b>odorants</b> were measured with various fluorescence dyes which monitor the fluidity at different depths and {{different regions of the}} membranes. (a) Application of various <b>odorants</b> changed the membrane fluidity of azolectin liposomes. The patterns of membrane fluidity changes in response to <b>odorants</b> having a similar odor were similar to each other and those in response to <b>odorants</b> having different odors were different from each other. These results suggested that <b>odorants</b> having a similar odor are adsorbed on a similar site and <b>odorants</b> having different odors are adsorbed on different sites. (b) Such variation of the pattern was not seen in liposomes of a simple composition (PC liposome). (c) In the proteoliposomes whose composition was more complex than that of azolectin liposomes, the patterns of membrane fluidity changes varied among <b>odorants</b> having a similar odor. It was concluded that liposomes of complex membrane composition have the variety of adsorption sites for <b>odorants...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{discrimination}} {{of thousands}} of <b>odorants</b> is mediated by several hundred olfactory receptors (ORs). It is generally accepted that the main strategy in encoding odor quality is a combinatorial receptor code scheme, in which <b>odorants</b> are discriminated by different sets of ORs. In the present study, we classified 12 test <b>odorants</b> by their receptor codes and perceived odor qualities to examine whether <b>odorants</b> showing similar receptor codes are also similar in their odor qualities. Similarities of receptor codes between <b>odorants</b> were estimated by the overlapping responses of murine isolated olfactory sensory neurons. In contrast, we conducted a human sensory test to classify the test <b>odorants</b> according to their odor qualities. Despite the difference in species, the groupings of the test <b>odorants</b> were well conserved between receptor code and odor quality. These findings indicate that <b>odorants</b> that are discriminated by murine receptor codes are perceived as different odors by humans and further suggest that similarity of receptor codes correlates with that of odor quality, at least in our test <b>odorants</b> at the concentrations tested.

In animal research certain brain altering drugs such as anti-depressants produce deficits in olfactory memory. In testing the effects of anti-depressants on olfactory sensitivity in mice, the “mice were tested in a Y-maze with a choice between an <b>odorant</b> (butanol) or distilled water before and during 3 weeks of dailyintra-peritoneal injection of either citalopram or clomipramine.

25|$|Many {{types of}} gear {{have been used}} to catch blue crabs along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. Initially people used very simple {{techniques}} and gear, which included hand lines, dip nets, and push nets among a variety of other gear types. The trotline, a long baited twine set in waters 5–15 feet deep, was the first major gear type used commercially to target hard crabs. Use of commercial trotlines is now mostly limited to the tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay. In the Gulf of Mexico, trotline use drastically declined after invention of the crab pot in 1938. Crab pots are rigid boxlike traps made of hexagonal or square wire mesh. They possess between two and four funnels that extend into the trap, with the smaller end of the funnel inside of the trap. A central compartment made of smaller wire mesh holds bait. Crabs attracted by <b>odorant</b> plumes from the bait, often an oily fish, enter the trap through the funnels and cannot escape.|$|E
2500|$|An <b>odorant</b> is a physiochemical {{molecule}} {{that binds}} {{to a specific}} receptor protein.

[...] Structure and complexity constitute an odorant’s features, with changes resulting in altered <b>odorant</b> quality. An odorant’s features are detected by the olfactory system’s glomeruli and mitral cells which {{can be found in the}} olfactory bulb, a cortical structure involved in the perceptual differentiation of odorants. [...] The olfactory bulb itself affects how odors come to be encoded through its temporal structure and firing rate, which in turn influences the likelihood of an <b>odorant</b> being remembered.|$|E
40|$|An odor-stimulated {{adenylate cyclase}} [ATP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4. 6. 1. 1] {{is thought to}} mediate {{olfactory}} transduction in vertebrates. However, {{it is not known}} whether the adenylate cyclase serves this function for all <b>odorants</b> or for only certain classes of <b>odorants.</b> To investigate this question, we have compared the abilities of 35 <b>odorants</b> to stimulate the adenylate cyclase and to elicit an electrophysiological response. We report a strong positive correlation between the magnitude of adenylate cyclase stimulation and the summated electrical response of the olfactory epithelium (electro-olfactogram) evoked by individual <b>odorants.</b> We also show that the adenylate cyclase stimulator forskolin equally attenuates the electro-olfactogram response for all <b>odorants</b> tested.

2500|$|In {{order to}} assist in {{detecting}} leaks, an odorizer {{is added to the}} otherwise colorless and almost odorless gas used by consumers. The odor has been compared to the smell of rotten eggs, due to the added tert-Butylthiol (t-butyl mercaptan). Sometimes a related compound, thiophane, may be used in the mixture. Situations in which an <b>odorant</b> that is added to natural gas can be detected by analytical instrumentation, but cannot be properly detected by an observer with a normal sense of smell, have occurred in the natural gas industry. [...] This is caused by odor masking, when one <b>odorant</b> overpowers the sensation of another. As of 2011, the industry is conducting research on the causes of odor masking.|$|E
2500|$|In {{threatening}} situations insects, aquatic organisms, birds, reptiles, {{and mammals}} emit <b>odorant</b> substances, initially called alarm substances, which are chemical signals now called alarm pheromones ("Schreckstoff" [...] in German). This is {{to defend themselves}} {{and at the same}} time to inform members of the same species of danger and leads to observable behavior change like freezing, defensive behavior, or dispersion depending on circumstances and species. For example, stressed rats release <b>odorant</b> cues that cause other rats to move away from the source of the signal. Pheromones are synthesized, emitted and perceived by all living organisms studied to date, with the exception of viruses and prions: i.e. in bacteria, prokaryotes, plants, plankton, parasites, insects, invertebrates and vertebrates (aquatic organisms, birds, reptiles, and mammals).|$|E

40|$|The {{olfactory}} cortex receives converging axonal inputs {{from many}} mitral and tufted {{cells in the}} olfactory bulb. Recent studies indicate that single cortical neurons integrate signals from diverse <b>odorants.</b> However, there remains a basic question, namely, the signals from which kinds of <b>odorants</b> are integrated by the individual cortical neurons? The present study examined {{the possibility that some}} cortical neurons integrate signals from distinct component <b>odorants</b> of natural foods because individual foods produce a fixed combination of <b>odorants.</b> Previous psychophysical studies of core <b>odorants</b> emitted by fruits and vegetables suggest that the olfactory images of individual natural foods are basically characterized by the profile of structural and perceptual categories of food-born <b>odorants.</b> The single-unit spike responses of neurons in the dorsoposterior part of rat anterior piriform cortex to a panel of eight food-related categories of <b>odorants</b> were herein examined. The results showed that many cortical neurons in this region are tuned selectively to either a single category or a specific combination of distinct categories. The cortical neurons showed mixture facilitation and mixture inhibition when stimulated with mixtures of distinct categories, thus suggesting that olfactory circuits {{may play a role in}} enhancing the category-profile selectivity of individual neurons. These results indicate that signals from distinct categories of food-born <b>odorants</b> are integrated in these cortical neurons. This suggests that these cortical neurons detect the odorant-category profile of foods to distinguish distinct food odors...|$|R

40|$|Using a {{conditioning}} paradigm, {{we assessed}} the olfactory sensitivity of six CD- 1 mice (Mus musculus) for six sulfur-containing <b>odorants</b> {{known to be}} components of the odors of natural predators of the mouse. With all six <b>odorants,</b> the mice discriminated concentrations < 0. 1 ppm (parts per million) from the solvent, and with {{five of the six}} <b>odorants</b> the best-scoring animals were even able to detect concentrations < 1 ppt (parts per trillion). Four female spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) and twelve human subjects (Homo sapiens) tested in parallel were found to detect the same six <b>odorants</b> at concentrations < 0. 01 ppm, and with four of the six <b>odorants</b> the best-scoring animals and subjects even detected concentrations < 10 ppt. With all three species, the threshold values obtained here are generally lower than (or in the lower range of) those reported for other chemical classes tested previously, suggesting that sulfur-containing <b>odorants</b> may play a special role in olfaction. Across-species comparisons showed that the mice were significantly more sensitive than the human subjects and the spider monkeys with four of the six predator <b>odorants.</b> However, the human subjects were significantly more sensitive than the mice with the remaining two <b>odorants.</b> Human subjects and spider monkeys significantly differed in their sensitivity with only two of the six <b>odorants.</b> These comparisons lend further support to the notion that the number of functional olfactory receptor genes or the relative or absolute size of the olfactory bulbs are poor predictors of a species' olfactory sensitivity. Analysis of odor structure-activity relationships showed that in both mice and human subjects the type of alkyl rest attached to a thietane and the type of oxygen moiety attached to a thiol significantly affected olfactory sensitivity...|$|R

40|$|Odors are {{powerful}} in bringing back old and vivid memories bearing emotional content. This inherent hedonic property of olfactory stimuli makes this sensory modality particularly suitable for studying autobiographical memory. In the present work, adolescents (first experiment), young adults (second experiment), and elderly (third experiment) {{of both sexes}} were asked to smell 10 familiar <b>odorants</b> and to report if these <b>odorants</b> evoked personal autobiographical memories or referential memories (i. e., names and objects). The participants were then required to link these memories to triplets of words using the progressive elaboration method of the Loci mnemonic. The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate whether 1) <b>odorants</b> evoking autobiographical memories led to faster reaction times (RTs) and to a greater number of correct responses in the recall of the items associated to such memories than do <b>odorants</b> evoking referential memories, 2) females differed from males on the above tasks along with the life span, and 3) the preferential codes (i. e., autobiographical or referential) attributed to the <b>odorants</b> vary according to gender and age. In general, it was observed that the way in which the <b>odorants</b> were encoded affected the subsequent retrieval. Indeed, data analyses have shown that <b>odorants</b> evoking autobiographical memories lead to faster RTs (experiments 2 and 3) and that females outperform males (experiments 1 and 2).

Furthermore, females are more prone than males to code the <b>odorants</b> autobiographically (as shown by the higher amount of autobiographical experiences that they have provided at all ages relative to males).

40|$|ABSTRACT (a) The {{responses}} of the vomeronasal organ to general <b>odorants</b> in the turtle, Geoclerays reevesii, were measured by recording the accessory olfactory bnlbar responses. The threshold concentrations of the vomeronasal responses to various <b>odorants</b> {{were similar to those}} in main olfactory bulbar responses, indicating that vomeronasal cells lacking cilia and olfactory cells having many cilia have similar sensitivities to general <b>odorants.</b> (b) The vomeronasal epithelium was perfused with 100 mM NaCI solution and the salt-free solution and the effects of NaC 1 on the vomeronasal responses to various <b>odorants</b> were examined. There was no essential difference between the concentration-response curves for n-amyl acetate and menthone dissolved in 100 mM NaCI solution and those dissolved in the salt-free solution in the whole concentration range examined. The ratios of the magnitudes ofvomeronasal responses in the salt-free solution to those in 100 mM NaC 1 solution were between 1. 01 and 1. 10 for seven <b>odorants</b> tested.

Thousands of <b>odorants</b> occur in foodstuffs, but only a small minority of them plays a role for the conscious perception of food aromas. Some <b>odorants</b> can be quite similar {{on the basis of their}} chemical properties but strikingly different in their sensory properties, yet others surprise with sensory similarity despite fundamental structural differences. Food aromas are inimitably composed of three up to 40 individual <b>odorants,</b> so that the composition of the final odors is subject to a complex combinatorial code.

As a consequence of these changes, across mitral cells in the olfactory bulb, individual odors should be better discriminated because of previous exposure. We have previously shown that a daily 2 -h exposure to <b>odorants</b> during 2 weeks enhances rats' ability to discriminate between chemically similar <b>odorants.</b> Here, we first show that the perception of test <b>odorants</b> is only modulated by enrichment with <b>odorants</b> that activate at least partially overlapping regions of the olfactory bulb. Second, we show that a broad activation of olfactory bulb neurons by daily local infusion of NMDA into both olfactory bulbs enhances the discrimination between chemically related <b>odorants</b> {{in a manner similar}} to the effect of daily exposure to <b>odorants.</b> Computational modeling of the olfactory bulb suggests that activity-dependent plasticity in the olfactory bulb can support the observed modulation in olfactory discrimination capability by enhancing contrast and synchronization in the olfactory bulb.

40|$|Abstract Background Our {{objective}} was to study the pattern of olfactory receptor expression within the dorsal and ventral regions of the mouse olfactory epithelium. We hypothesized that olfactory receptors were distributed based on the chemical properties of their ligands: e. g. receptors for polar, hydrophilic and weakly volatile <b>odorants</b> would {{be present in the}} dorsal region of olfactory epithelium; while receptors for non-polar, more volatile <b>odorants</b> would be distributed to the ventral region. To test our hypothesis, we used micro-transplantation of cilia-enriched plasma membranes derived from dorsal or ventral regions of the olfactory epithelium into Xenopus oocytes for electrophysiological characterization against a panel of 100 <b>odorants.</b> Findings <b>Odorants</b> detected by ORs from the dorsal and ventral regions showed overlap in volatility and water solubility. We did not find evidence for a correlation between the solubility and volatility of <b>odorants</b> and the functional expression of olfactory receptors in the dorsal or ventral region of the olfactory epithelia.

50|$|The {{cells of}} the {{olfactory}} epithelium, including olfactory sensory neurons, begin to differentiate soon after the induction of the olfactory placode.

The differentiated olfactory sensory neurons extend pioneering axons, which follow guidance cues released by the underlying mesenchyme, as well as other chemotrophic cues released from the telencephalon. As development of the olfactory pathway progresses, more axons innervate the olfactory bulb, which develops from the rostral-most region of telencephalon. The organization and subsequent processing of <b>odorant</b> information is possible due to the convergence of olfactory sensory neuron axons expressing the same <b>odorant</b> receptors onto the same glomerulus at the olfactory bulb.|$|E

40|$|In many insects, mate finding {{relies on}} female-released sex pheromones, which {{have to be}} deciphered by the male {{olfactory}} system within an odorous background of plant volatiles present in the environment of a calling female. With respect to pheromone-mediated mate localization, plant <b>odorants</b> may be neutral, favorable or disturbing. Here we examined the impact of plant <b>odorants</b> on detection and coding of the major sex pheromone component, (Z) - 11 -hexadecenal (Z 11 - 16 :Ald) in the noctuid moth Heliothis virescens. By in vivo imaging the activity in the male antennal lobe, we monitored the interference {{at the level of}} olfactory sensory neurons (OSN) to illuminate mixture interactions. The results show that stimulating the male antenna with Z 11 - 16 :Ald and distinct plant-related <b>odorants</b> simultaneously suppressed pheromone-evoked activity in the region of the macroglomerular complex (MGC), where Z 11 - 16 :Ald-specific OSNs terminate. Based on our previous findings that antennal detection of Z 11 - 16 :Ald involves an interplay of the pheromone binding protein HvirPBP 2 and the pheromone receptor HR 13, we asked if the plant <b>odorants</b> may interfere with any of the elements involved in pheromone detection. Using a competitive fluorescence binding assay, we found that the plant <b>odorants</b> neither bind to HvirPBP 2 nor affect the binding of Z 11 - 16 :Ald to the protein. However, imaging experiments analyzing a cell line that expressed the receptor HR 13 revealed that plant <b>odorants</b> significantly inhibited the Z 11 - 16 :Ald-evoked calcium responses. Together the results indicate that, plant <b>odorants</b> can interfere with the signaling process of the major sex pheromone component at the receptor level. Consequently, it can be assumed that plant <b>odorants</b> in the environment may reduce the firing activity of pheromone-specific OSNs in H. virescens and thus affect mate localization...|$|R
40|$|Single {{concentrations}} of six <b>odorants</b> (eugenol, heptyl alcohol, nonanal, 1 -octanol, dl-menthol, valeric acid) {{were selected to}} be trigeminal stimuli, based upon previous studies done through anosmics (individuals that lack a functional olfactory system). The stimuli were presented in random order three time each in vapor-phase either retronasally or oral-cavity-only. They were identified on a digital computer by 20 subjects (ages 18 to 35, 9 females). Retronasal presentations were produced by inhaling via the mouth with a nose clip closing the nostrils, and then removing the nose clip and exhaling from the nose. Oral-cavity-only presentations were produced by inhalation via the mouth with a nose clip closing the nostrils, and exhalation from the mouth with the nose clip remaining in place. This study investigates if subjects could identify <b>odorants</b> when restricted to the oral-cavity-only using the same identifiers of the <b>odorants</b> when presented retronasally. RESULTS: Median percent retronasal correct identifications [correct identification terms are shown in brackets] were: eugenol, 100 % [cloves or spice]; heptyl alcohol, 67 % [cleaner]; nonanal, 58 % [citrus or floral]; 1 -octanol, 71 % [citrus or cleaner]; dl-menthol, 100 % [ointment or peppermint]; valeric acid, 67 % [rancid or sweat]. Median percent correct oral-cavity-only identifications were all 0 %, except for dl-menthol, for which percent correct oral-cavity-only median correct identification was 67 %.
