Using the Breunig and Wong (2007) decomposition technique, we uncover the contributions to aggregate labour productivity of continuing, entering and exiting firms based on exporting and ownership status. We find that within-firm productivity growth <b>of</b> <b>exporters</b> drives overall productivity growth, with significant differences apparent between productivity growth rates of foreign and domestic owned establishments. ...|$|R

30|$|We {{begin by}} {{analyzing}} the concentration of exports by firm. Table  1 presents the concentration of exports for the top firm, and the top 5, top 50, top 200 and top 1000 firms over the 1997 – 2015 period. We use absolute numbers to identify top firms, rather than percentages (e.g. top 1 % <b>of</b> <b>exporters),</b> because the number <b>of</b> <b>exporters</b> increases with the GDP (Fernandes et al. 2015).|$|R
40|$|The {{percentage}} <b>of</b> <b>exporters</b> and multinational enterprises (MNEs) varies substantially across industries. We {{extend the}} firm heterogeneity model presented in Helpman et al. (2004) to derive testable {{predictions about the}} prevalence of these internationalized modes. The model indicates that intra-industry firm heterogeneity and R&D intensity play large roles in the inter-industry variation {{of the number of}} internationalized firms. We investigate whether these factors as well as import tariff affect the structure of export and foreign direct investment (FDI) using Japanese industry-level data. We obtain results that are consistent with the model. First, industries with larger productivity dispersion have a larger percentage <b>of</b> non-MNE <b>exporters,</b> a larger percentage of MNEs, and a larger percentage of the sum <b>of</b> <b>exporters</b> and MNEs. Second, MNEs are heavily concentrated in R&D intensive industries.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} in {{what extent}} innovation {{contributes to the}} productivity premium <b>of</b> <b>exporters.</b> We start by performing non parametric tests on TFP distributions on different groups of firms characterized by their export and innovation behavior. We show that the TFP distributions <b>of</b> <b>exporters</b> and innovators stochastically dominate those <b>of</b> non <b>exporters</b> and <b>of</b> non innovators, respectively. We pursue with OLS regressions and show that the export premium, defined as the productivity advantage <b>of</b> <b>exporters</b> over non-exporters, is robust {{to the introduction of}} innovation statistics. We conclude that export and innovation each have specific mechanisms in their relationship with productivity. The contribution of innovation abilities remains however small: once controlled for the firm size, its ownership, and its innovation abilities, the residual export premium is still around 3 %. Two additional results are found. First, both process and product innovations are associated with higher productivity when process innovation is strictly defined. Second, when accounting for distance to export markets, the export premium remains significant for global exporters only, whereas that <b>of</b> intra-Europe <b>exporters</b> vanishes. From these findings, we conclude that, beyond innovative abilities and mere size advantage, specific export-related competencies, such as specific managerial competencies or specific human capital, takes an important part in the success <b>of</b> Global <b>exporters...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} a new database that characterizes exporter behavior across 45 countries. The database was built from firm-level customs data and includes measures <b>of</b> <b>exporter</b> size, concentration, entry and exit, and diversification. Based on the data, we uncover four novel stylized facts. (1) More developed and larger economies have a larger export base (number <b>of</b> <b>exporters),</b> larger average exporter size, more concentrated export sectors (among firms), more diversified <b>exporters</b> in terms <b>of</b> products and destinations, and lower entry and exit rates. (2) Within countries, exports grow more {{in the short run}} through bigger firms (intensive margin) than through more firms (extensive margin). (3) Entry and exit rates are strongly positively correlated with each other and are negatively correlated with entrant survival rates, average exporter size, and exporter diversification across countries. (4) Average exporter size is not explained by country or sector characteristics while the number <b>of</b> <b>exporters,</b> the share <b>of</b> the top 1 % <b>of</b> <b>exporters,</b> the average number of products and destinations per exporter, entry and exit rates are explained to an important extent by those characteristics.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I discuss {{critically}} Mathias Risse's paper “Responsibility and Global Justice. ” First, I argue that for Risse's pluralist {{account of the}} grounds of justice to hold together, there is need to presuppose a monist standpoint which ultimately contributes to grounding principles of justice. Second, I point out that Risse's understanding <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> accountability and justification is rather narrow in that it functions as an addendum to <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice. Conversely, I will suggest that the <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> accountability plays a deeper role: The conditions that ground it feature {{at the same time}} among the grounds <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice. Accordingly, the kind of relation that gives rise to a duty among agents to account for their actions must be in place when <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice obtain. Following on from these remarks I will adumbrate an alternative account of the relation which grounds (enforceable) <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice...|$|R

40|$|Notions of {{cosmopolitan}} {{and environmental}} citizenship {{have emerged in}} response to concerns about environmental sustainability and global inequality. But {{even if there are}} <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> egalitarian justice that extend across state boundaries, or <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> environmental justice to use resources in a sustainable way that are owed to those beyond our borders, it is far from clear that these are best conceptualised as <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> global or environmental citizenship. Through identifying a core concept of citizenship, I suggest that citizenship obligations are, by their nature, owed (at least in part) in virtue of other aspects of one's common citizenship, and that <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice, even when they arise as a result of interconnectedness or past interactions, are not best conceived as <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> citizenship in the absence of some other bond that unites the parties. Without ruling out the possibility of beneficial conceptual change, I argue that Andrew Dobson's model of ecological citizenship is flawed because there is no good reason to regard the <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> environmental justice which it identifies as <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> ecological citizenship, and that other models of cosmopolitan or global citizenship face a similar objectio...|$|R

We then estimate industrial productivity Pareto distributions, and cut-offs of domestic sales of non-exporters and foreign sales <b>of</b> <b>exporters</b> for each industry.

40|$|The {{study in}} this paper is on the causal {{relationship}} between export activities of firms and their characteristics in a transition country that is pursuing export-led growth strategies and experiencing a fast track of trade liberalization. For this purpose, we examine the superiority <b>of</b> <b>exporters</b> using a panel of firm-level data of manufacturing firms in Vietnam. We observe that exceptional performance <b>of</b> <b>exporters,</b> especially in TFP, does prevail in this country. Via testing self-selection hypothesis using a random-effects dynamic probit model to examine the causality from firm characteristics to export probability, we find significantly positive impacts of factors such as firm size, age or foreign ownership but not that of TFP. However, TFP superiority <b>of</b> <b>exporters</b> is satisfactorily explained by the existence of learning-by-exporting effects that are tested in a multivariate analysis using matching technique in combination with difference-in-differences approach. Besides contributing an empirical analysis to heterogeneous-firm trade theories, this study gives us some insights into the interpretation of mixed findings in macro-analysis {{of the effects of}} exports on growth in Vietnam.
