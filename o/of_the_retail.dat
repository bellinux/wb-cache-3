St Johns Retail Park is just off Toneway, going towards the motorway and consists of two units. It is occupied by DFS and more recently joined by Go Outdoors, where two vacant units were amalgamated into one for their opening in April 2014. Taunton's second largest retail park is Priory Fields Retail Park, located on Priory Avenue. It consists of five units plus an anchor store, Wickes Extra. It was redeveloped in 2003 to modernise the rather worn out appearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>retail</b> park and also to increase retail floorspace.|$|E

5|$|Ireland is {{the third}} best seller European market of E85 flex-fuel vehicles, after Sweden and France. Bioethanol (E85) in Ireland is made from whey, a waste product of cheese manufacturing. The Irish {{government}} established several incentives, including a 50% discount in vehicle registration taxes (VRT), which can {{account for more than}} one third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>retail</b> price of a new car in Ireland (around €6,500). The bioethanol element of the E85 fuel is excise-free for fuel companies, allowing retail prices to be low enough to offset the 25 per cent cut in fuel economy that E-85 cars offer, due to ethanol's lower energy content than gasoline. Also, the value added tax (VAT) on the fuel can also be claimed back. E-85 fuel is available across the country in more than 20 of Maxol service stations. In October 2005, the 1.8 Ford Focus FFV became the first flexible-fuel vehicle to be commercially sold in Ireland. Later Ford launched the C-max and the Mondeo flexifuel models. Saab and Volvo also have E85 models available.|$|E
5|$|The {{architect}} Norman Shaw, then aged 73, {{was brought}} in to draw up proposals for the Circus and the Quadrant after early plans were felt to be unsatisfactory. His scheme was approved in principle but subject to indecision and dispute, both on property acquisition and retailers' demand for bigger display windows. Shaw's design for the Piccadilly Hotel was completed in 1908 with modifications, while the Quadrant was rebuilt by Blomfield, adapting Shaw's designs. The work started in 1923 and was completed by 1928. Significantly, no accommodation was built above any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>retail</b> properties, contributing to the demise of the West End as a place of residence. A limited number of architects were responsible for the redesigned street, including Sir John James Burnet, Arthur Joseph Davis and Henry Tanner.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> {{standardization}} / adaptation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>retailing</b> format {{has become more}} critical due to <b>the</b> increasing internationalization <b>of</b> companies. In fact, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main problems they have to face is the possibility or not <b>of</b> replicating abroad <b>the</b> characteristics <b>of</b> a format which is successful in the local market. This alternative significantly depends not only on <b>the</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local distribution system {{but also on the}} differences related to in-store consumer behaviour. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> this paper is to analyse <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> standardization / adaptation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>retailing</b> format from a consumer perspective, taking into consideration two countries – France and Italy – that at a first glance could be considered quite similar by store managers who want to internationalize their stores networks. So the main question is: nowadays is standardization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>retailing</b> format possible (i. e. shopping consumer behaviour is homogenized in Italy and France), or is it preferable to adapt the concept (i. e. local culture is still prevalent) ? A cross-cultural research has been organized with <b>the</b> interview <b>of</b> a sample of 534 women of various ages, in charge <b>of</b> house-keeping activities. <b>The</b> analysis carried out hereby has pointed out that while French consumers appreciate <b>the</b> sensorial dimension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> store, Italian women tend {{to pay more attention to}} the social aspects. The authors thank the reviewers for their precious recommendations and even if they did not have the time to take all of them into account in the present paper, they intend to do it in their future researches.
