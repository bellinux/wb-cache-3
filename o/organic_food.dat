40|$|There {{have been}} many studies of what {{influences}} consumers in their decisions to purchase or consume <b>organic</b> <b>foods,</b> mainly concerned with fresh <b>organic</b> <b>foods.</b> These show a discrepancy between attitudes and behavior with people being positive about <b>organic</b> <b>foods</b> but often not purchasing them. This discrepancy seems to {{be explained by the}} fact that consumers do not consider "organically produced" to be an important purchase criterion, that <b>organic</b> <b>foods</b> are not perceived to surpass conventional foods regarding taste and shelf life (two qualities rated to be of great importance), and because of the perceived premium prices of <b>organic</b> <b>foods.</b> In two Swedish studies, health benefits were demonstrated to be more strongly related to attitudes and behavior toward <b>organic</b> <b>foods</b> than were perceived environmental benefits.

The Environmental Working Group objected to his report, mainly questioning his statements about bacteria, but also managed to determine that the produce had never been tested for pesticides. They communicated this to Stossel, but after the story's producer backed Stossel's statement that the test results had been as described, the story was rebroadcast months later, unchanged, and with a postscript in which Stossel reiterated his claim. Later, after a report in The New York Times confirmed the Environmental Working Group's claims, ABC News suspended the producer of the segment for a month and reprimanded Stossel. Stossel apologized, saying that he had thought the tests had been conducted as reported. However, he asserted that the gist of his report had been accurate.|$|E

The international community has identified many industries whose practices have been known to violate social sustainability, and many of these industries have organizations in place that aid in verifying the social sustainability of products and services. The Equator Principles (financial industry), Fair Wear Foundation (garments), and Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition are examples of such organizations and initiatives.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare {{perceptions}} about the benefits and the motivation for selecting and consuming <b>organic</b> <b>foods</b> between students in two different geographic locations (e. g., Ball State University (BSU) in Muncie, Indiana and University of Oregon (U of 0) in Eugene, Oregon). A total of 183 adults completed this survey— 76 students from BSU and 107 students from U of O. The results indicated that Oregon students were much more likely to choose <b>organic</b> <b>foods</b> than Indiana students on a "daily" or "weekly" basis. Students in Oregon were more likely to feel that artificial colorings and flavors, hormones, and antibiotics in meat were harmful to humans. Artificial colorings and flavors were also viewed as detrimental to the environment by Oregon students. <b>Organic</b> <b>foods</b> were viewed as healthier, safer, better for the environment, better tasting, and more in harmony with political and religious views to students surveyed in Oregon. More Indiana students stated that a higher cost was a reason why they did not select <b>organic</b> <b>foods.</b> Overall, Oregon students were much more likely to consume <b>organic</b> <b>foods,</b> and they were more likely to feel that the consumption of <b>organic</b> <b>foods</b> was beneficial to both humans and the environment.

We propose that people learn the statistical structure of the environment through observation and use the learned structure to guide ecologically rational behavior.

In Study 3, we show that people perceive organic products as more healthful when the statistical structure justifies this inference.

40|$|The aim was {{to study}} {{consumer}} attitudes to and perceptions of organic and genetically modified (GM) foods and factors influencing the purchase/non purchase of {{these two types of}} foods. Data were collected by two questionnaire surveys (random nation-wide samples of 2000 consumers, response rate 58 % and 39 % respectively) and one interview study (n= 40). A majority of the consumers had positive attitudes towards purchasing <b>organic</b> <b>foods</b> but few reported purchasing <b>organic</b> <b>foods</b> regularly. The most common beliefs about <b>organic</b> <b>foods</b> were that they are more expensive and healthier. Choice of <b>organic</b> <b>foods</b> was related to the perceived consequences for human health and to environmentally friendly behaviour. Perceived positive health consequences appeared to be a stronger motive for purchasing <b>organic</b> <b>foods</b> than were environmental benefits. Attitudes towards genetic engineering (GE) appear to be dependent on the application area. Medical applications were generally more easily accepted than were food and agricultural applications. However, all medical applications were not equally accepted. Consumers had generally rather negative attitudes towards GM foods, which were perceived as not being healthy. GM of animals for food production was perceived more negative than GM of plants. Tangible benefits of GM foods, like being better for the environment or healthier, seemed to have a potential to increase willingness to buy. The results indicate that the attitudes to <b>organic</b> and GM <b>foods</b> differ: the attitude to <b>organic</b> <b>foods</b> is positive while the attitude to GM foods is more negative. Further, the perceptions of <b>organic</b> and GM <b>foods</b> are opposed in relation to health. The purchase of <b>organic</b> <b>foods</b> and the potential willingness to purchase GM foods appear to be related to positive consequences for health and the environment...|$|R
