25|$|Initially, Miller's {{candidacy}} {{was somewhat}} conservative. He focused his campaign <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>record</b> of ending corruption, enhancing mine safety and winning sizeable pay increases. But {{in order to}} shore up support during the campaign, Miller agreed to seek additional democratic reforms advocated by militant district leaders. One reform would have given local unions the right to strike on their own.|$|E

Both sides released numerous television and radio advertisements, as well as mailers to registered Republicans. Christie focused <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>record</b> of fighting corruption, while Lonegan emphasized his credentials as a lifelong conservative.|$|E

He ran against State Senator Susan Castillo and Rob Kremer in the May primary, and finished a distant third to Castillo with 114,203 votes to her 406,247. Castillo won enough votes to avoid a runoff in the November general election and took over for Bunn on January 5, 2003.|$|E

25|$|In 1938 Edwin Jaeckle, the New York Republican Party Chairman, {{selected}} Dewey {{to run for}} Governor of New York {{against the}} Democratic incumbent, Herbert H. Lehman. Dewey was only 36 years of age. He based his campaign <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>record</b> as a famous prosecutor of organized-crime figures in New York City. Although he was defeated, Dewey's surprisingly strong showing against the popular Lehman (he lost by only 1.4%), brought him national political attention and made him a front runner for the 1940 Republican presidential nomination. Jaeckle was one of Dewey's top advisors and mentors {{for the remainder of}} his political career.|$|E
25|$|The England batsmen were {{battered}} and bruised {{to such an}} extent that in one game a local player was used to make up an XI. The 41-year-old Colin Cowdrey was sent to reinforce the team <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>record</b> sixth tour of Australia and opened the England innings in the second Test at Perth a few days after his arrival and without any match practice. Denness's form deserted him for most of the tour and he became the first captain to drop himself from a Test match, but returned to make 188 and win the Sixth Test by an innings, the highest score by an England captain in Australia.|$|E

The Lions won their first playoff game only to lose, 15 to 11 to Beaumont Hebert in the state quarterfinals. The next season, Coach Wood lost the opening games to Abilene Cooper and Breckenridge. The Lions would tie another non-conference game to Weatherford at 0 before going undefeated {{the rest of the}} season and claiming another district title. 1980 also played another role in Brownwood's history, as Cen-Tex Stadium was renamed Gordon Wood stadium. The Lions inaugurated the stadium's new name with a 34 to 7 victory over Stephenville on October 24. After the regular season, Wood's Lions won the opening round of the playoffs against Wichita Falls Hirschi, but lost to Lubbock Estacado 14 to 0 in the quarterfinals. The Lions turned in their gear with eight wins, three losses, and one tie.|$|E
500|$|... "Childhood" [...] is a biographical song, written, {{produced}} and sung solely by Michael Jackson.

500|$|Sociologist J. Gordon Melton {{wrote that}} along with Stewart Lamont's Religion Inc., Miller's book is [...] "by far the best" [...] among the books {{published}} by Scientology critics, though {{he notes that the}} Church of Scientology has [...] "prepared statements on each [...] indicating factual errors and omissions." [...] Melton concludes that Miller's book is compromised by its author's lack of access to documents charting Hubbard's life and the early history of the church. Melton contradicts Miller's assertion that Hubbard was lying about his military career. [...] "Hubbard left the service in February 1946 with twenty-one citations, letters of commendation, and medals <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>record.</b> It {{should be noted that the}} details of Hubbard's naval career have been called into question by the critics of Scientology. Critics rely on an alleged copy of Hubbard's notice of separation deposited in the Veteran's Administration and accessible through the Freedom of Information Act." ...|$|E

500|$|Polemics such as Guilty Men, {{which helped}} {{demolish}} Chamberlain's reputation for {{his foreign policy}} as premier, also touched <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>record</b> as minister. These books blamed the National Government, in which Chamberlain had taken a leading role, for a failure to rearm. Historian David Dutton suggested in his book on Chamberlain that the damage to his reputation, both as Prime Minister and as a Cabinet minister, could have been contained had the Conservative Party defended his policies, but for 23years after Chamberlain's death, the party leaders (Churchill, Anthony Eden, and Harold Macmillan) had made reputations as opponents of appeasement, and who were little minded to defend Chamberlain's record as a minister. The Labour landslide in the 1945 General Election cemented this inclination, with Macmillan stating {{that it was not}} [...] "Churchill who had brought the Conservative party so low. On the contrary it was the recent history of the Party, with its pre-war record of unemployment and its failure to preserve peace." ...|$|E
500|$|Harrison taped {{the basic}} track for {{his version of}} [...] "Far East Man" [...] at Friar Park over August and September 1974, during {{sessions}} for his album Dark Horse.

Leng describes [...] "Far East Man" [...] as [...] "the first Harisong to tap into 1970s soul" [...] and notes the [...] "supreme soul credentials" [...] of Newmark, as the former drummer with Sly and the Family Stone, and Weeks, who had supplied the highly regarded basslines on Donny Hathaway Live (1972). Newmark later recalled of his and Weeks' first sessions for Harrison: [...] "We were completely thrilled to be asked to play <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>record</b> … It was the most exciting thing to happen to me. I had to keep pinching myself to remember it was real." ...|$|E
500|$|As the {{convention}} approached, journalists awoke {{to the fact}} that McKinley would, most likely, be the Republican nominee. [...] Those newspapers that were Democratic in their outlook, including publisher William Randolph Hearst's New York Journal, sent reporters to Canton to dig up dirt on McKinley. [...] The candidate had a sterling reputation for personal and political honesty, and reporters found that even McKinley's few personal enemies spoke well of him. McKinley's financial problem in 1893 {{was one of the few}} marks <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>record,</b> and the newspapers began to suggest that those who had made large contributions to aid him would own him as president. [...] Attacks on some of McKinley's associates, such as Chicago publisher H. H. Kohlsaat or McKinley's old friend from his days as a practicing lawyer, Judge William R. Day, cut little ice with voters; the press had better luck with Hanna. [...] The Journal began to describe McKinley's backers as a [...] "Syndicate", staking money to secure a bought-and-paid-for president. [...] Journal reporter Alfred Henry Lewis attracted considerable attention when he wrote, [...] "Hanna and the others will shuffle and deal him like a pack of cards." ...|$|E
