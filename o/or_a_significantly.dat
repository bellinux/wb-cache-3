Fundamental {{research in this area}} is however complicated by the time frame restrictions during which host-microbe interactions can be studied in vitro. The model proposed in this paper, consisting of an oral epithelium and biofilm, can be used to study microbe-host crosstalk in vitro in non-infectious conditions up to 72 h. Microbiota derived from oral swabs were cultured on an agar/mucin layer and challenged with monolayers of keratinocytes grown on plastic or collagen type I layers embedded with fibroblasts. The overall microbial biofilm composition in terms of diversity remained representative for the oral microbiome, whilst the epithelial cell morphology and viability were unaffected.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I study {{in detail the}} {{conditions}} of the interstellar medium of a three starburst galaxies that cover a wide range of metallicities and star formation areas. I have shown a strong support for efficient destruction of PAH molecules by UV photons in NGC 5253, independently of variations of metallicity. In a more luminous central starburst galaxy such as M 82, the radiation field is about 40 times softer than in NGC 5253 with little spatial variation, and the star formation has been strongly suppressed in the last 5 Myr as a result of feedback effects. On scales larger than a few kiloparsecs, large scale events like galaxy interactions become relevant. From studying Arp 143, I found strong support for the scenario in which a radially expanding, large-scale shock wave from a head-on galaxy-galaxy collision has swept up the interstellar medium and triggered the formation of these clusters. Finally, I investigated the properties of the dust emission in starburst environments. A small fraction of galaxies require a very cold component with T< 14 K.

40|$|SummaryThe {{detection}} and discrimination of chemical compounds in potential foods are essential sensory processes when animals feed. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster employs 68 different gustatory receptors (GRs) {{for the detection}} of mostly nonvolatile chemicals that include sugars, a diverse group of toxic compounds present in many inedible plants and spoiled foods, and pheromones [1 – 6]. With the exception of a trehalose (GR 5 a) and a caffeine (GR 66 a) receptor [7 – 9], the functions of GRs involved in feeding are unknown. Here, we show that the Gr 64 genes encode receptors for numerous sugars. We generated a fly strain that contained a deletion for all six Gr 64 genes (ΔGr 64) and showed that these flies exhibit no <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>significantly</b> diminished proboscis extension reflex (PER) response when stimulated with glucose, maltose, sucrose, and several other sugars. The only considerable response was detected when Gr 64 mutant flies were stimulated with fructose. Interestingly, response to trehalose is also abolished in these flies, even though they contain a functional Gr 5 a gene, which has been previously shown to encode a receptor for this sugar [8, 9]. This observation indicates that two or more Gr genes are necessary for trehalose detection, suggesting that GRs function as multimeric receptor complexes. Finally, we present evidence that some members of the Gr 64 gene family are transcribed as a polycistronic mRNA, providing a mechanism for the coexpression of multiple sugar receptors in the same taste neurons...|$|E
40|$|The authors, {{in order}} to sift through the {{increasingly}} muddy waters of affirmative action, {{provide an overview of}} the development of permissible preferential treatment based on race, national origin, or gender in the forty years since Title VII was enacted. The article discusses the state of the law for affirmative action plans adopted by government contractors as well as those that are judicially imposed. The focus of the piece is on the voluntary race, national origin and gender-conscious plans in the private sector. The authors conclude that although in the forty years since Title VII was enacted the validity of voluntary affirmative action is not longer in question, private employers remain reluctant to adopt such practices for several reasons. First, because the Supreme Court has failed to define the line between permissible and impermissible affirmative action. Second, because voluntary affirmative action requires a finding of past discrimination <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>significantly</b> imbalanced workforce, employers may be reluctant to implement such programs and risk that these factual predicates will be used against them in litigation.

Tn 5 insertion mutagenesis {{was used to}} identify genes affecting holdfast production or function in the marine strain MCS 6. Twelve thousand Tn 5 insertion mutants were screened for adhesion defects by an assay involving the attachment of cells to polystyrene microtiter dish wells. Among adhesion-defective mutants, those with multiple polar (pleiotropic) defects were excluded and the remainder were examined {{for the presence of}} holdfast. Forty-one mutants that produced no detectable holdfast <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>significantly</b> reduced amount were found. Southern blot and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analyses indicated that 11 unique Tn 5 insertions were clustered in three regions of the genome. In addition, 71 mutants that adhered poorly or not at all to polystyrene, yet still produced a holdfast, were found. Southern blot and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analyses of 15 of these mutants showed eight unique Tn 5 insertion sites clustered in two additional regions of the genome. An assay involving attachment to glass treated with siloxane chemicals (producing surfaces with varying degrees of hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity) was used to attempt characterization of this phenotype. Unexpectedly, no simple pattern of differences in binding between the mutants and wild-type caulobacters was found. In particular, no reduction in the ability of the mutants to bind to hydrophobic surfaces was noted. Complementation with cosmid clones was successful in nearly all cases and confirmed the designation of five genomic regions of holdfast-related genes. No detectable cross-hybridization was observed with several holdfast-related gene regions from a freshwater caulobacter, providing further evidence that the marine and freshwater caulobacters are genetically distinct...|$|E

Our spectra reveal absorption from interstellar Na I, K I, Ca II, and CH+, and {{from a number of}} diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs), at a velocity close to that exhibited by H I 21 cm emission from M 51 at the position of NGC 5195. The H I column density implied by the equivalent width of the 5780. 5 DIB, based on the relationship between W(5780. 5) and N(H I) derived for sight lines in the local Galactic interstellar medium, is consistent with the column density obtained from the integrated H I emission. The H 2 column density predicted from the observed column density of K I, using the Galactic relationship between N(K I) and N(H 2), is comparable to N(H I), suggesting a high molecular fraction (~ 0. 65) for the M 51 gas toward NGC 5195. The DIBs toward NGC 5195 are, on average, ~ 40 % weaker than would be expected based on the K I column density, a further indication that the gas in this direction has a high molecular content. The M 51 material is characterized also by a high N(Na I) /N(Ca II) ratio (> 11), indicative of a high degree of Ca depletion, and a high W(5797. 1) /W(5780. 5) ratio (~ 1. 6), suggestive of either a very weak ambient radiation field <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>significantly</b> shielded environment.

We detect absorption from the NaI doublet within the exoplanet's atmosphere at the 9 sigma confidence level within a 5 Ang band (absorption depth 0. 09 +/- 0. 01 %) and use the data to measure the doublet's spectral absorption profile. We detect only the narrow cores of the doublet. The narrowness of the feature {{could be due to}} an obscuring high-altitude haze of an unknown composition <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>significantly</b> sub-solar NaI abundance hiding the line wings beneath a H 2 Rayleigh signature. We compare the spectral absorption profile over 5. 5 scale heights with model spectral absorption profiles and constrain the temperature at different atmospheric regions, allowing us to construct a vertical temperature profile. We identify two temperature regimes; a 1280 +/- 240 K region derived from the NaI doublet line wings corresponding to altitudes below ~ 500 km, and a 2800 +/- 400 K region derived from the NaI doublet line cores corresponding to altitudes from ~ 500 - 4000 km. The zero altitude is defined by the white-light radius of Rp/Rstar= 0. 15628 +/- 0. 00009. The temperature rises with altitude, which is likely evidence of a thermosphere. The absolute pressure scale depends on the species responsible for the Rayleigh signature and its abundance. We discuss a plausible scenario for this species, a high-altitude silicate haze, and the atmospheric temperature-pressure profile that results.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Menu energy {{labelling}} at {{point of purchase}} is gaining traction worldwide, yet the potential impact for different socioeconomic groups is unclear. We aimed to summarise evidence {{on the effectiveness of}} menu {{energy labelling}} by socioeconomic position (SEP). METHODS: A systematic search for papers published to September 2015 was conducted using terms for labelling, food outlets, and SEP. Quality of studies was assessed. Results were summarised across stages of an intervention logic pathway. RESULTS: Eighteen articles were identified. Of twelve studies reporting the effect of menu energy labelling in low SEP populations, six reported on purchase outcomes. All but one of these reported no positive effect of the policy for this population. Two of the five studies that compared purchase outcomes of menu labelling across SEP groups reported that the policy was effective overall. These two studies reported either a significant decline in fast food calories purchased from consumers in high (but not low) SEP neighbourhoods <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>significantly</b> greater decline in calories purchased among consumers visiting stores in higher SEP neighbourhoods post policy implementation. Few studies were rated as moderate to high quality. CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence describing the impact of menu energy labelling within or across SEP is limited in quantity and quality. Of the two studies that reported a positive benefit of menu energy labelling overall, both identified a greater effect on fast food purchases among consumers visiting stores in high compared to low SEP neighbourhoods. It is difficult to know whether the absence of effectiveness reported in low SEP populations represents a true lack of effectiveness or is a result of a more general lack of policy effectiveness or the limited quality of the reviewed studies...|$|E
