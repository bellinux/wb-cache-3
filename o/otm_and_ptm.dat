40|$|Oral-transmucosal (OTM) drug {{delivery}} refers to noninvasive and painless administration of medical preparations through any oral cavity membrane to achieve systemic effects (Sattar et al., 2014). Regarding sedative drugs, OTM administration is very attractive in veterinary medicine, especially for patients difficult to inject and restrain (Messenger et al., 2016). This study aims {{to compare the}} pharmacokinetics of dexmedetomidine after <b>OTM</b> <b>and</b> intramuscular (IM) administration combined with methadone. After obtaining Ethical Committee approval and owner’s written consent, eight dogs, were administered with dexmedetomidine (10 mg/kg) and methadone (0. 4 mg/kg) by <b>OTM</b> <b>and</b> other 4 dogs by IM route. Blood samples were collected at prefixed times up to four hours. Dexmedetomidine was quantified by a validated HPLC-MS method. On dexmedetomidine concentrations, a pharmacokinetic analysis was carried out with a noncompartmental approach (Phoenix WinNonlin® 7. 0, Pharsight, Cary, NC). Mean ± SD terminal half-lives of dexmedetomidine were 187. 42 ± 109. 66 and 94. 78 ± 34. 08 min after <b>OTM</b> <b>and</b> IM administration, respectively. Maximum serum (Cmax) concentrations were 0. 83 ± 0. 32 and 9. 09 ± 2. 46 ng/mL for <b>OTM</b> <b>and</b> IM administration, respectively. Time to maximum concentration (Tmax) were 44. 38 ± 32. 16 and 21. 25 ± 11. 39 min by <b>OTM</b> <b>and</b> IM administration, respectively. Area under the curve from 0 to the last measured concentration (AUClast) were 103. 75 ± 30. 23 and 614. 87 ± 77. 15 min*ng/mL for <b>OTM</b> <b>and</b> IM administration, respectively. Cmax, Tmax and AUClast values by OTM route demonstrate a lower and delayed absorption of the drug compared to IM. To complete the study, the pharmacokinetic analysis of methadone is foreseen, so as a clinical trial to compare the clinical effects of the combination of dexmedetomidine <b>and</b> methadone by <b>OTM</b> <b>and</b> IM administration and to establish an effective dosage of oral-transumucosal route in dogs for this association...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{changing}} age demographics in the United States, by 2050, an estimated 62. 1 Americans {{will be over}} the age of 65 and the number of Americans with cognitive impairment, such as Alzheimer’s disease, will increase drastically as well (Alzheimer’s Association, 2014; Ortman, Velkoff, 2 ̆ 6 Hogan, 2014). Once a diagnosis or behavioral indicators of cognitive impairment are present, it would be beneficial to apply a treatment package that promotes the maintenance or re-establishment of stimulus control in the environment. From a behavioral perspective, stimulus control aids in learning and memory through both respondent and operant conditioning. In the current study, stimulus equivalence training was completed and compared to cognitive and functional assessments scores with older adult participants with and without cognitive impairment as a systematic replication of Gallagher and Keenan (2009). Formation of equivalence relations after exposure to linear series (LS) training with 2 3 -member stimulus classes across arbitrary, familiar, and stimuli from Gallagher and Keenan (2009) was compared via trials to criterion, accuracy per relation, and session length to scores on the Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE), Saint Louis University State Exam (SLUMS), and Barthel ADL Index. Several methodological changes were applied to a second study to examine the impact of increased programmed stimuli, training changes, and the use of one-to-many (<b>OTM)</b> <b>and</b> many-to-one (MTO) training structures with 3 3 -member stimulus classes on equivalence formation.

Whilst interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) is directly involved in OTM, the role of interleukin- 1 receptor antagonist (IL- 1 Ra), a naturally occurring IL- 1 antagonist, is not completely defined. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to investigate the effects of IL- 1 Ra on OTM. MethodsAn orthodontic appliance was placed in C 57 BL 6 mice treated with vehicle or IL- 1 Ra (10 mg/kg/day). <b>OTM</b> <b>and</b> TRAP-positive osteoclasts were evaluated after 12 days of mechanical loading and the levels of cytokines on periodontal tissues were analysed by ELISA after 12 and 72 h. ResultsMice treated with IL- 1 Ra showed diminished <b>OTM</b> <b>and</b> decreased numbers of TRAP-positive osteoclasts. In line with this, lower levels of IL- 1 β and TNF-α, and higher levels of IL- 10, were observed on periodontal tissues of IL- 1 Ra-treated mice in relation to the vehicle-treated group. ConclusionThe present study suggests that IL- 1 Ra downregulates OTM, probably by its anti-inflammatory actions...|$|R

40|$|The {{receptor}} {{tyrosine kinase}} ErbB 2 is a breast cancer biomarker whose posttranslational modifications (PTMs) are a key indicator of its activation. Quantifying the expression <b>and</b> <b>PTMs</b> of biomarkers such as ErbB 2 by selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mass spectrometry has several limitations, including minimal coverage and extensive assay development time. Therefore, we assessed the utility of two high resolution, full scan mass spectrometry approaches, MS 1 Filtering and SWATH MS 2, for targeted ErbB 2 proteomics. Endogenous ErbB 2 immunoprecipitated from SK-BR- 3 cells was in-gel digested with trypsin, chymotrypsin, Asp-N, or trypsin plus Asp-N in triplicate.

Study design: Randomized, blinded' crossover study, with 1 month washout between treatments. Animals: Six healthy neutered female cats, weighing 5. 3 - 7. 5 kg. Methods: A combination of dexmedetomidine (40 gkg(- 1)) and buprenorphine (20 gkg(- 1)) was administered {{by either the}} OTM (buccal cavity) or IM (quadriceps muscle) route. Sedation was measured using a numerical rating scale, at baseline and at various time points until 6 hours after treatment. At the same time points, analgesia was scored using a dynamic and interactive visual analogue scale, based on the response to an ear pinch, and by the cat's response to a mechanical stimulus exerted by a pressure rate onset device. Physiological and adverse effects were recorded, and oral pH measured. Signed rank tests were performed, with significance set at p< 0. 05. Data are presented as median and range. Results: There were no differences in sedation or antinociception scores between <b>OTM</b> <b>and</b> IM dosing {{at any of the}} time points.

As globalisation may have affected competitive pressure in individual product markets differently, export pricing is analysed for 11 product categories. Analytically, this problem is solved by applying the Saikkonen (1991) approach to estimate the individual export price categories in single equations. The first hypothesis - that CPT is stronger, <b>and</b> <b>PTM</b> weaker, for heterogeneous products than for homogeneous products - is found to hold more for CPT than for PTM. The second hypothesis, which presumes that CPT has weakened <b>and</b> <b>PTM</b> has strengthened since the 1990 s, is confirmed with respect to the overall outcome, although for several product categories the results conflict with the hypothesis.

40|$|Biochemical {{studies of}} lipoproteins have {{shed light on}} their composition, highly {{contributing}} to the comprehension of their function. Due {{to the complexity of}} their structure, however, an in-depth structural analysis, in terms of components <b>and</b> <b>PTMs,</b> may still unravel important players in physiological and pathological processes of lipid metabolism. In this study, we performed a protein map of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) using a 2 -DE MALDI-TOF/TOF proteomic approach. Several VLDL-associated apolipoproteins were identified, including five isoforms of apoE, three isoforms of apoC-IV, and one isoform each of apoC-III, apoM, apoA-I, and apoA-IV. Notably, we also identified seven isoforms of apoL-I and two isoforms of prenylcysteine Iyase as new VLDL-associated proteins. Furthermore, we were able to identify PTM of apoE, which was found to be differently O-glycosylated at Thr(212) residue, <b>and</b> <b>PTM</b> of apol-I which we described, for the first time, to be phosphorylated at Ser(296). While the physiological relevance of our finding remains to be assessed, we believe that our results will be useful as reference for future studies of VLDL structure in specific physiopathological conditions...|$|R

40|$|SummaryPlatensimycin (<b>PTM)</b> <b>and</b> platencin (PTN) are potent inhibitors of {{bacterial}} fatty acid synthases and {{have emerged as}} promising antibacterial drug leads. We previously characterized the <b>PTM</b> <b>and</b> PTN biosynthetic machineries in the Streptomyces platensis producers. We now identify two mechanisms for <b>PTM</b> <b>and</b> PTN resistance in the S. platensis producers—the ptmP 3 or ptnP 3 gene within the PTM-PTN or PTN biosynthetic cluster and the fabF gene within the fatty acid synthase locus. PtmP 3 /PtnP 3 <b>and</b> FabF confer <b>PTM</b> <b>and</b> PTN resistance by target replacement and target modification, respectively. PtmP 3 /PtnP 3 also represents an unprecedented mechanism for fatty acid biosynthesis in which FabH and FabF are functionally replaced by a single condensing enzyme. These findings challenge the current paradigm for fatty acid biosynthesis and {{should be considered in}} future development of effective therapeutics targeting fatty acid synthase...|$|R
