5|$|In Pseudo-Kodinos' work, the Grand Droungarios of the Watch ranks 24th in the {{imperial}} hierarchy, between the Eparch and the megas hetaireiarches. The Grand Droungarioss distinctive court dress, as reported by Pseudo-Kodinos, consisted of a gold-brocaded hat (skiadion), a plain silk kabbadion tunic and a staff (dikanikion) with a gilded knob on top, and covered with golden-red braid below. For ceremonies and festivities, he bore the domed skaranikon, <b>of</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>and</b> golden silk and decorated with gold wire embroidery, and with {{a portrait of the}} emperor seated on a throne in front and another with the emperor on horseback on the rear.|$|E
5|$|Isaac Newton had demonstrated, using prisms, {{that white}} lights, such as sunlight, are {{composed}} {{of a number of}} monochromatic components which could then be recombined into white light. Newton also showed that an orange paint made <b>of</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>and</b> red could look exactly like a monochromatic orange light, although being composed of two monochromatic yellow and red lights. Hence the paradox that puzzled physicists of the time: two complex lights (composed of more than one monochromatic light) could look alike but be physically different, called metameres. Thomas Young later proposed that this paradox could be explained by colours being perceived through a limited number of channels in the eyes, which he proposed to be threefold, the trichromatic colour theory. Maxwell used the recently developed Linear algebra to prove Young's theory. Any monochromatic light stimulating three receptors should be able to be equally stimulated by a set of three different monochromatic lights (in fact, by any set of three different lights). He demonstrated that to be the case, inventing colour matching experiments and Colourimetry.|$|E

The Swedish law does not regulate the design of the Swedish pennant, but it is recommended that its color scheme should correspond with that of the flag.|$|E
25|$|The flag is coincidentally {{very similar}} to the civil flag of Andorra and the state flag of Chad. The {{similarity}} with Chad's flag, which differs only in having a darker shade of blue (indigo rather than cobalt), has caused international discussion. In 2004, Chad asked the United Nations to examine the issue, but then-president of Romania Ion Iliescu announced no change would occur to the flag. The flag of Moldova is related to the Romanian tricolor, except it has a 1:2 ratio, a lighter shade of blue, a slightly different tint <b>of</b> <b>yellow,</b> <b>and</b> the Moldovan coat of arms in the middle. The civil ensign of Belgium uses black rather than blue.|$|E

A new badge with broadly similar features was introduced for the 2014–15 season following {{the use of a}} commemorative centenary badge for the 2013–14 campaign. The newly formed club in 2015 adopted a new logo before acquiring the rights to a number of legacy items for €250,000 a year later.|$|E
25|$|Up {{until the}} 1980s, the {{government}} encouraged {{the production of}} basic crops (mainly corn and beans) by maintaining support prices and controlling imports through the National Company for Popular Subsistence (CONASUPO). With trade liberalization, however, CONASUPO was to be gradually dismantled and two new mechanisms were implemented: Alianza and Procampo. Alianza provides income payments and incentives for mechanization and advanced irrigation systems. Procampo is an income transfer subsidy to farmers. This support program provides 3.5million farmers who produce basic commodities (mostly corn), and which represent 64% of all farmers, with a fixed income transfer payment per unit of area of cropland. This subsidy increased substantially during president Fox's administration, mainly to white corn producers {{in order to reduce}} the amount of imports from the United States. This program has been successful, and in 2004, roughly only 15% of corn imports are white corn –the one used for human consumption and the type that is mostly grown in Mexico– as opposed to 85% <b>of</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>and</b> crashed corn –the one use for feeding livestock, and which is barely produced in Mexico.|$|E
500|$|The east {{window of}} the choir is a broad, seven-light window dating from 1340–45. It depicts the Tree of Jesse (the {{genealogy}} of Christ) and demonstrates the use of silver staining, a new technique that allowed the artist to paint details on the glass in yellow, as well as black. The combination <b>of</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>and</b> green glass {{and the application of}} the bright yellow stain gives the window its popular name, the [...] "Golden Window". It is flanked by two windows each side in the clerestory, with large figures of saints, also dated to 1340–45. In 2010 a major conservation programme was undertaken on the Jesse Tree window.|$|E

500|$|Green is {{the color}} between blue and yellow on the visible spectrum. It is evoked by light with a has {{dominant}} wavelength of roughly 495570 nm. In subtractive color systems, [...] used in painting and color printing, it is created by a combination <b>of</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>and</b> blue, or yellow and cyan; in the RGB color model, used on television and computer screens, {{it is one of}} the additive primary colors, along with red and blue, which are mixed in different combinations to create all other colors. [...] By far the largest contributor to green in nature is chlorophyll, the chemical by which plants photosynthesize and convert sunlight into chemical energy. Many creatures have adapted to their green environments by taking on a green hue themselves as camouflage. Several minerals have a green color, including the emerald, which is colored green by its chromium content.|$|E

The New York Critique wrote, [...] "He is an orator by divine right, and his strong, intelligent face in its picturesque setting <b>of</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>and</b> orange was hardly less interesting than those earnest words, and the rich, rhythmical utterance he gave them".

American newspapers reported Vivekananda as [...] "the greatest figure in the parliament {{of religions}}" [...] and [...] "the most popular and influential man in the parliament".|$|E
500|$|In {{common with}} its {{neighbouring}} isles, Eday is largely formed from Middle Devonian Old Red Sandstone {{deposited in the}} Orcadian Basin. The Eday Group is the name for a substantial sequence of sandstones that is found at many locations in Orkney, for which Eday and the area around Eday Sound are the type area. In places {{it is up to}} [...] thick, and is largely composed <b>of</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>and</b> red sandstones with intervening grey flagstones and marls. The rock is easily quarried and some of the yellow sandstones from Fersness were used in the construction of St Magnus Cathedral in Kirkwall. The Devonian sequence is deformed into a major fold, the north-south trending Eday Syncline, with the youngest part of the sequence, the Upper Eday Sandstone outcropping in the north of the island from Bay of Cusby to Red Head. The oldest part of the sequence, the Rousay Flagstones are found on {{the eastern side of the}} island at Bight of Milldale and from Kirk Taing to War Ness, and to the west from Sealskerry Bay to Fersness. Veness is formed of Upper Eday Sandstone downfaulted against the flagstones.|$|E
