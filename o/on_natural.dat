5|$|Historically, {{the game}} was {{developed}} <b>on</b> <b>natural</b> grass turf. However, in 1976, the International Hockey Federation (FIH) made artificial pitches mandatory at all major competitions. The 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal {{was the first of}} these; however at this time few players had seen or played on synthetic pitches. Although it is still permissible to play <b>on</b> <b>natural</b> turf all national competitions and international matches must be played on an artificial surface. Elite-level competitions, such as the Olympic Games and World Cup, require a water-based playing surface. However, due to water conservation efforts, this is not seen as a long-term sustainable option and alternative elite surfaces that do not require water are being researched.|$|E
40|$|This is {{an action}} {{research}} study {{which focuses on}} a didactical model founded on base ten decomposition as an algorithm for performing division <b>on</b> <b>naturals.</b> Base ten decomposition is used to enhance the algebraic structure of division <b>on</b> <b>naturals</b> {{in an attempt to}} cross the cognitive divide that currently exists between arithmetic long division <b>on</b> <b>naturals</b> and algebraic long division on polynomials. The didactical model that is proposed and implemented comprises three different phases and was implemented over five one hour lessons. Learners’ work and responses which were monitored over a fiveday period is discussed in this report. The structure of the arithmetic long division <b>on</b> <b>naturals</b> formed the conceptual basis from which shorter methods of algebraic long division on polynomials were introduced. These methods were discussed in class and reported on in this study...|$|R

5|$|At {{the first}} tournament in 1920, {{there were many}} {{differences}} from the modern game: games were played outdoors <b>on</b> <b>natural</b> ice, forward passes were not allowed, the rink (which had been intended to be used only for figure skating) was 56m×18m (165ft×58.5ft) and two 20-minute periods were played. Each team had seven players on the ice, the extra position being the rover. Following the tournament, the IIHF held a congress and decided to adopt the Canadian rules—six men per side and three periods of play.|$|E

Many Chinese writers over the centuries contributed to the written knowledge of herbal pharmaceutics. The Han Dynasty (202 BC-220 AD) includes the notable work of the Huangdi Neijing and the famous pharmacologist Zhang Zhongjing. There were also the 11th century scientists and statesmen Su Song and Shen Kuo who compiled learned treatises <b>on</b> <b>natural</b> history, emphasising herbal medicine.|$|E
5|$|In the {{so-called}} modern {{synthesis of the}} early 20th century, Ronald Fisher brought together Darwin's theory of evolution, with its insistence <b>on</b> <b>natural</b> selection, heredity, and variation, and Gregor Mendel's laws of genetics into a coherent structure for evolutionary biology. Biologists assumed that an organism was a straightforward reflection of its component genes: the genes coded for proteins, which built the organism's body. Biochemical pathways (and, they supposed, new species) evolved through mutations in these genes. It was a simple, clear and nearly comprehensive picture: {{but it did not}} explain embryology.|$|E
5|$|Its {{primary goal}} was to inform the Greek-speaking public within the Ottoman Empire and in the diaspora. Moreover, in favouring the views of Adamantios Korais it {{reflected}} the style of other European periodicals of that era. It reviewed developments in arts and sciences and was an important channel for bringing contemporary intellectual movements {{to the attention of}} the Ottoman-ruled Greeks. Additionally, it reproduced catalogues of European scientific books, and exhorted Greek scholars to translate and publish them, like those of Louis Jacques Thénard. The journal also published comments on astronomical observations, experiments and various articles <b>on</b> <b>natural</b> philosophy, which alternated with articles on history and philosophy. Greek scholars used as sources German or French educational books on physics, or translated and published texts <b>on</b> <b>natural</b> philosophy with large circulations in Europe, like the works of Antoine Fourcroy, René Just Haüy, and Jérôme Lalande.|$|E

5|$|Lock Haven's economy, {{from the}} city's {{founding}} in 1833 {{until the end}} of the 19th century, depended heavily <b>on</b> <b>natural</b> resources, particularly timber, and on cheap transportation to eastern markets. Loggers used the Susquehanna River and Bald Eagle Creek to float timber to sawmills in Lock Haven and nearby towns. The West Branch Canal, reaching the city in 1834, connected to large markets downstream, and shorter canals along Bald Eagle Creek added other connections. In 1859, the first railroad arrived in Lock Haven, spurring trade and economic growth.|$|E
5|$|Longyearbyen is {{the centre}} of tourism on the archipelago, {{although}} most tourism is generated based <b>on</b> <b>natural</b> experiences rather than visiting the town itself. However, Longyearbyen does provide supplies, accommodation and several museums. In 2008, Longyearbyen experienced 89,000 guest-nights, up from 30,000 in 1995. The average guest stayed 2.2 nights and 60 percent of the capacity was used by tourists. About 40,000 tourists flew into Longyearbyen. Two-thirds of the tourists come from Norway. In 2007, the tourism industry had a revenue of NOK291 million and produced 200 man-years.|$|E
