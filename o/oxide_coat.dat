Its affinity for oxygen forms a thin stable <b>oxide</b> <b>coat</b> on the outer surface, creating a passivation layer which prevents further oxidation of the chromium, and of the underlying metal (if any), even in corrosive environments. Chromium plating on steel for automotive use involves three diffusion barrier layers—copper, nickel, then chromium—to provide long term durability where {{there will be many}} large temperature changes. If chromium is plated directly onto the steel, then their different thermal expansion coefficients will cause the chrome plating to peel off the steel.

The results are explained on the basis of increased scattering in the nanowire and the known temperature dependence of the electronic properties of bulk Bi.

40|$|Outboard {{elements}} (arms, towers) {{are widely}} used in spacecraft structure for setting-out of a payload; their high stiffness-weight ratio provides an opportunity to decrease the mass. The deployment unit is considered {{as an example of}} outboard structure. Its strength beams work under special conditions in operation. At the transportation stage beams are under considerable vibration loads. Therefore for increasing the natural resonance frequency it is rational to increase their rigidity. Using the micro-arc <b>oxide</b> <b>coating</b> suggests itself because the modulus of elasticity of the micro-arc <b>oxide</b> <b>coating</b> is more than that of the aluminium alloy. The beams suffer considerable bending load at the step of deploying; therefore the aluminium alloy with the micro-arc <b>oxide</b> <b>coating</b> must have suitable loading capacity, in addition to increased rigidity. Influence of micro-arc <b>oxide</b> <b>coating</b> on the rigidity and strength of tubes f rom aluminium alloy is investigated. It is determined that forming the micro-arc <b>oxide</b> <b>coating</b> on thin-walled tubes with a ratio of the coating area to the cross-section area of more than 25 % is the most rational. In this case the rigidity of composite material considerably exceeds the rigidity of the aluminium alloy of the same cross-section while the redistribution of stresses in the surface coating of heterogeneous elasticity cross-section doesn’t cause the sudden increase of stresses. Also forming an attainable thickness of the micro-arc <b>oxide</b> <b>coating</b> on the surface of tube from aluminium alloy will be rational solution because the increase of attainable thickness of the microarc <b>oxide</b> <b>coating</b> provides an opportunity to form it on thick-walled tubes saving an acceptable, {{in the context of the}} strength, ratio of the coating area to the overall cross-section area. Micro-arc oxidation is an advanced method to form the wear resistant, resistant to corrosion, heat-shielding and electrically insulating coatings, but depending on the operating conditions, type of structures, and dominant type of deformations the choice of the micro-arc <b>oxide</b> <b>coating</b> thickness can have a considerable effect on the loading capacity of structure. </p...|$|R

The interfacial adhesion of the coated substrates with glob top resins and a moulding compound was measured {{and the failure}} mechanisms were studied from the fracture surface analysis. Moisture resistance of the substrates was evaluated using the C-mode scanning acoustic microscopy (C-SAM) analysis and the lead pull test. The result showed that the black <b>oxide</b> <b>coating</b> improved the interfacial bond strength with both the glob top resins and the moulding compound. The surface hardening process reduced the total thickness of black <b>oxide</b> <b>coating,</b> but the coating thickness was rather insensitive to the shot peening condition. The interfacial bond strength was in general higher for the as-grown coating than the surface-hardened coating. There were correlations between the interfacial adhesion, the coating thickness and the surface energy of coated substrates: the button shear strength of a glop top resin increased with oxide thickness and substrate surface energy. The moisture resistance of the substrate with black <b>oxide</b> <b>coating</b> was {{much higher than the}} bare copper substrate. After hydrothermal ageing, significant delamination occurred between the bare copper and the moulding compound, whereas there was little delamination on the black <b>oxide</b> <b>coated</b> samples.

40|$|The {{active process}} in a short length of steel wire {{passivated}} by 65 per cent nitric acid has been observed {{under the influence of}} a polarizing current, and the form of the potential recorded by the cathode ray oscillograph. In the passive wire, 80 per cent of the total potential drop takes place at the anode, 20 per cent at the cathode. The change from active to passive states, as measured by the potential change, is very abrupt compared to the duration of activity and the potential curve at a point on the wire is probably almost rectangular. The duration of the refractory state is decreased at the anode and increased at the cathode, as in nerve. This fact is against the idea that reactivity after passivation results from a partial reduction of an oxide layer. Soft iron wire passivated by anodal polarization repassivates after activation in acid of a dilution that fails to passivate it initially. It soon becomes rhythmic with a very short refractory phase, and then reacts continuously. Such a wire exhibits a very sharp alternation between a dark brown <b>oxide</b> <b>coat</b> during activity, and a bright clean surface during passivation. A passive steel wire in nitric acid shows many of the characteristics of an inert electrode such as platinum, and it may be inferred that, superposed upon the primary passivation potential, there exists an electrode or oxidation-reduction potential equilibrium between the effects of the various constituents of the solution. It is suggested that the phenomena of nerve-like reactivity in this system may involve an alternation between two protective coatings of the steel wire. During activity, the surface becomes mechanically coated with a brown oxide. If this coating does not adhere, due to gas convection or to rapid solution of the oxide, passivation does not result. Under sufficiently intense oxidizing conditions, a second <b>oxide</b> <b>coat</b> may form in the interstices of the first, and cover the surface as the first coating dissolves off. This furnishes the electrochemical protection of passivation, which is followed by the gradual attainment of electrode equilibrium with the solution...|$|E

40|$|Manual brazing, {{as it is}} {{used today}} in the {{manufacture}} of automobile bodywork, can be of variable quality and may be responsible for thermal damage to both base material and filler metal. Reworking is often necessary, but the need for this expensive and time-consuming process can be minimised by the automation of the brazing procedure. If Nd:YAG-lasers are used as heat sorce for brazing, the laser energy can be controlled with ease and specific temperature fields can be set up. Fibre-optic laser routing also makes it easy to integrate the technology into manufacturing systems. The goal of this project was the systematic development and optimisation of process controls and associated systems technology for automated flux-free brazing using double-beam laser technology. The system developed in the project was designed to handle modern bodywork materials (DC 04; DC 04 +ZE) and materials for lightweight construction (AlMg 0, 4 Sil, 2; AlMg 5 W 17) as well as aluminium alloys in combination with construction steels. The highest brazing quality was achieved with L-CuZn 40 and L-Ag 55 Sn filler metals. The use of 95 % N_ 2 and 5 % H_ 2 as a protection gas allowed flux-free brazing. If allowances are made for capillary action and gravity, it is possible to produce high quality joints using laser brazing and spacial seam-orientation. It is advantageous to use on-line process controls for the processing of critical contours. In flux-free laser brazing of aluminium alloys, an additional pulsed Nd:YAG-laser is used to modify the surface activity, making the surface more wettable to the filler metal. The different heat dispersal coefficients of aluminium and its <b>oxide</b> <b>coat</b> lead to disruption of this oxide layer and enable the filler metal to wet the surface. Combinations of construction steel and aluminium alloy can be brazed without flux by using the reducing gas and a zinc-based solder which is capable of wetting both materials. (orig.)

40|$|Abstract Several {{methods for}} removal of soluble maugauese from {{drinking}} water exist. One of these options involves adsorption of the maugauese onto Mn <b>oxide</b> <b>coated</b> filter media. Dissolved maugauese (Mn(H)) is adsorbed to {{sites on the}} Mn <b>oxide</b> <b>coating</b> aud then oxidized by free chlorine, thus regenerating the media sites for further Mn adsorption. This method has been successfully used by numerous water treatment plauts, decreasing Mn levels to below treatment goals. A disadvautage to this method {{is the use of}} chlorine prior to filtration, which cau lead to increased levels of disinfection by-products as compared to post-filter chlorination. Nine plauts that use <b>oxide</b> <b>coated</b> filter media for Mn removal participated in this study. The objective of this research was to characterize the filter media at these plauts. The media was characterized with respect to size, <b>oxide</b> <b>coating</b> level, surface area aud Mn uptake capacity. Laboratory aud full scale studies were conducted {{to assess the impact of}} chauges in pre-filter chlorination on the Mn adsorption process. The authracite aud saud media from nine drinking water treatment plauts had a wide rauge of <b>oxide</b> <b>coating</b> levels, rauging from less thau 0. 01 to more thau 120 mg Mn per gram of media. All dual media filters show a depth profile with more oxidized Mn on the surface of the media in the upper authracite layers thau in the lower saud layers. Filters with homogeneous media showed no such depth variable profile. The effective size of authracite media aualyzed rauged from 0. 67 mm to 1. 0 mm. The effective size of saud media rauged from 0040 to 0. 73 mm. Samples were analyzed for Mn uptake in a recirculating laboratory batch system before and after regeneration with a 20 mglL solution of free-chlorine for 15 - 24 hours. Media in the laboratory regenerated state had approximately 130 % of the Mn uptake exhibited by media in the as-is (un-regenerated) condition for cases where media had been exposed to continuous pre-filter chlorination at the full scale plants. The media from the nine plants exhibited a wide range ofMn uptake, ranging from 0. 01 to 0. 7 mg Mn per gram of media after regeneration (20 mglL free chlorine). In general, it was found that the Mn uptake by the media was directly proportional to the amonnt of Mn <b>oxide</b> <b>coating</b> on the media. However, at coating levels above 20 mg Mn per gram of media, an increase in coating level was not fonnd to always yield a proportional increase in Mn uptake. The surface area of <b>oxide</b> <b>coated</b> filter media was also characterized. Media with Mn coating levels ranging from less than 0. 5 to over 120 mg Mn per gram of media had surface areas ofl. 2 to 92 m 2 /gram of media. Results show that the surface area of media is directly proportional to the amonnt ofMn <b>oxide</b> <b>coating</b> on the media for traditional media filters. However, samples taken from Mn removal filters that have a particle filtration step upstream in the treatment process had relatively low surface area despite high levels ofMn <b>oxide</b> <b>coating.</b> Laboratory and full scale studies were conducted to determine the impact of restarting pre-filter chlorination after a period of months when the filter did not receive pre-filter chlorine. Media from the Stamford water treatment plant, which had its Mn uptake capacity exhausted, was shown to resume Mn removal soon after receiving a chlorine dose of 2. 0 mglL. At the full-scale, after a period of 5 months without chlorine, the <b>oxide</b> <b>coated</b> media produced satisfactory Mn effluent concentrations upon resumption of prefilter chlorination. These results indicate that the characteristics of <b>oxide</b> <b>coated</b> filter media and the process of Mn adsorption are interdependent. A sound understanding of the filter media at a particular water treatment plant could facilitate an optimization of the Mn adsorption process. Further research is recommended to better understand the contribution of particles encapsulated in Mn <b>oxide</b> <b>coating</b> to the surface area of the filter media...|$|R
