25|$|Following {{the end of}} World War II and the {{demobilisation}} of the Bevin Boys, came new trainees, {{this time}} men from <b>our</b> <b>allies</b> in Europe wanting to make their home in England, particularly a large contingent from Poland. Even after the last trainee moved on the end was not quite in site, a new borehole topped with a pumping house was constructed on the site to help solve the water table problems at Brookhouse. This operated until the closure of Brookhouse Colliery in 1986 when it was finally switched off – the end for Birley had arrived.|$|E
25|$|Following a short {{service by}} the Dean, the Prince of Wales, who himself {{had served in}} the war, declared:I unveil this tablet in honour of our comrades, from every land under the Crown, who fell in the Great War. Time cannot dim our remembrance of them, nor lessen our {{gratitude}} to <b>our</b> <b>Allies,</b> who have given us the land in which many of them lie buried, so that we can care for their graves for ever. This was followed by the laying of a wreath, the dedication by the Dean, the hymn O Valiant Hearts (a war poem set to music to remember the fallen of the Great War), prayers, the first verse of the National Anthem, and the closing blessing. After the Prince and the Prime Ministers had left, the Abbey was opened to allow those waiting outside to join the rest of the congregation in viewing the memorial.|$|E
25|$|It {{must surely}} have a deplorable effect upon <b>our</b> <b>Allies</b> {{to be told}} by an ex-Cabinet Minister that the Palestine Administration do not like Jews, {{and that there are}} enough anti-Semites in Great Britain to back up the Hitler policy and spirit. This {{suggestion}} is a complete reversal of the truth. If a comparison is to be made with the Nazis, it is surely those who wish to force an imported régime upon the Arab population who are guilty of the spirit of aggression and domination. Lord Wedgwood's proposal that Arabs should be subjugated by force to a Jewish régime is inconsistent with the Atlantic Charter, and that ought to be told to America. The second principle of that Charter lays down that the United States and ourselves desire to see no territorial changes that do not accord with the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned; and the third principle lays down that they respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of Government under which they will live.|$|E

500|$|After the war the Australian Signal Officer-in-Chief, Major General Colin Simpson, {{paid tribute}} to the {{spotters}}, writing that they were [...] "infantrymen without a typical battlefield, artillerymen without field pieces and tank crews without tanks. Apart from a hard core of very talented personnel, all that most spotters had in common was an abysmal ignorance of {{anything to do with}} signals. Yet they won the respect of <b>our</b> <b>Allies</b> and every branch of the Australian forces". He continued, stating that [...] "they were dedicated to their duty and they never failed. The New Guinea Air Warning Wireless Company is a Signal unit of which very little has been heard as their duties were top secret at all times. It can be stated that the successful course of the war could have been seriously delayed, if not greatly prolonged, if this signal unit had not operated so efficiently." ...|$|E

Thanks to a carefully planned time-table, the effects of wear and tear had been kept to a minimum. Captain Parker described the march discipline – [...] "As we marched through the country of <b>our</b> <b>Allies,</b> commissars were appointed to furnish us with all manner of necessaries for man and horse ... the soldiers {{had nothing to do}} but pitch their tents, boil kettles and lie down to rest." [...] In response to Marlborough's manoeuvres, the Elector and Marsin, conscious of their numerical disadvantage with only 40,000 men, moved their forces to the entrenched camp at Dillingen on the north bank of the Danube. Marlborough could not attack Dillingen {{because of a lack of}} siege guns – he was unable to bring any from the Low Countries, and Baden had failed to supply any despite assurances to the contrary.|$|E

The administration then launched a four-day bombing campaign named Operation Desert Fox, lasting from December 16 to 19, 1998. At the end of this operation Clinton announced that [...] "So long as Saddam remains in power, he will remain a threat to his people, his region, and the world.
