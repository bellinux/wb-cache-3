5|$|It {{has been}} known to kill deer, {{especially}} in winter when smaller prey is scarce, or when deer populations become more abundant. One study in the Everglades showed a large majority of kills (33 of 39) were fawns, but prey up to eight times the bobcat's weight could be successfully taken. It stalks the deer, often when the deer is lying down, then rushes in and grabs it by the neck before biting the throat, base of the skull, or chest. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasions</b> a bobcat kills a deer, it eats its fill and then buries the carcass under snow or leaves, often returning to it several times to feed.|$|E

25|$|As {{fluoroquinolone}} {{is one of}} the few antibiotics widely {{effective against}} P. aeruginosa, in some hospitals, its use is severely restricted to avoid the development of resistant strains. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasions</b> where infection is superficial and limited (for example, ear infections or nail infections), topical gentamicin or colistin may be used.|$|E

25|$|Since World War II Maltese {{political}} culture has {{developed into a}} two-party system dominated by the Labour Party and the Nationalist Party. Although other political parties have presented candidates and, in some cases, elected MPs, in most cases these were splinter groups of the main parties and, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasions</b> when they were successful, this success was short-lived.|$|E
50|$|In {{accordance}} with <b>the</b> House Rules, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasion</b> that a member becomes unruly, the Sergeant at Arms, upon {{order of the}} Speaker, lifts the mace from its pedestal and presents it before the offenders, thereby restoring order.|$|R

25|$|Mount Binuluan {{is usually}} covered in cloud or mist and so {{photographs}} could {{be difficult to}} obtain. The village of Bangtitan in Upper Uma in Lubuagan is a good vantage point for views and photography of the mountain <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasions</b> when the primary peak is not mist-enshrouded. It is not known if Binuluan itself has ever been climbed as access to the site is very difficult. The terrain is rugged and undeveloped.|$|E
25|$|Ridgway {{was born}} in Stockport, Cheshire, England on 10 August 1923. As a county cricketer, Ridgway, {{although}} not appearing a likely successful pace bowler because of his slight build, was the mainstay of Kent's opening attack for a decade after World War II, except <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasions</b> that Jack Martin could get away from business. Ridgway did not play regularly in 1946, but the following year he jumped into prominence with 12 for 86 on a rain-affected pitch against Yorkshire.|$|E
25|$|On the Royalist side, the {{campaign}} of 1645 opened in the west, where Charles II, the young prince of Wales was sent with Hyde (later, Earl of Clarendon), Hopton, and others as his advisers. General (Lord) Goring, however, now {{in command of the}} Royalist field forces in this quarter, was truculent, insubordinate and dissolute. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasions</b> when he did his duty, however, he did display a certain degree of skill and leadership, and the influence of the prince's counsellors was but small.|$|E

25|$|The New York parade {{is moved}} to the {{previous}} Saturday (16 March) in years where 17 March is a Sunday. The event also has been moved <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasions</b> when, due to Easter's falling on a very early date, 17 March would land in Holy Week. This same scenario arose again in 2008, when Easter fell on 23 March, but the festivities occurred on their normal date and were enjoyed by {{a record number of}} viewers. In many other American cities (such as Philadelphia), the parade is always held on the Sunday before 17 March, regardless of the liturgical calendar.|$|E
25|$|For state ceremonies, the dignitaries {{would enter}} through the Kenreimon (建礼門), {{which has a}} cypress-wood roof, and is {{supported}} by four unpainted wooden pillars.

Passing through the Kenreimon, the inner gate Jomeimon would appear, which is painted in vermilion and roofed in tile. This leads to the Shishin-den, which is the Hall for State Ceremonies. The Gekkamon is a smaller gate {{on the west side of}} the main courtyard.|$|E
25|$|Hungry ghost realm (Preta): hungry ghosts {{suffer from}} extreme hunger and thirst. They wander {{constantly}} {{in search of}} food and drink, only to be miserably frustrated any time they come close to actually getting what they want.

500|$|George's heavy {{drinking}} and indulgent lifestyle {{had taken their}} toll on his health by the late 1820s. While still Prince of Wales, he had become obese through his huge banquets and copious consumption of alcohol, making him the target of ridicule <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasions</b> that he appeared in public; [...] by 1797 his weight had reached [...] By 1824, his corset was made for a waist of [...] He suffered from gout, arteriosclerosis, peripheral edema ("dropsy"), and possibly porphyria.

Hoffman was more accommodating for interviews after blown saves than he was after successful ones. [...] "The people asking the questions are not responsible for the ball flying out of the park", he explained. Both Towers and Black best remember Hoffman for his accountability after his blown save in the 2007 Wild Card tie-breaker.|$|E
50|$|When {{the tunnel}} is open, the lake's {{turbidity}} increases. The sudden influx of the Adige's water, {{which is both}} appreciably colder and more polluted than the lake's, causes a considerable heat shock and significantly worsens the habitat for fish.For these reasons the tunnel is used only <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasion</b> {{when there is a}} flood risk in the Veronese basin.|$|R
5000|$|The {{government}} had {{a policy of}} total silence <b>on</b> <b>the</b> actions of the maquis. For this reason, outside of the areas of maquis activity, the population had practically no knowledge of <b>the</b> maquis. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasion</b> that an item appeared in the press, the maquis were always referred to as [...] "bandoleros" [...] (bandits), in order to strip the actions of all political context.|$|R

500|$|By 1786, {{two-thirds of}} the coins in {{circulation}} in Britain were counterfeit, and the Royal Mint responded by shutting itself down, worsening the situation. Few of the silver coins being passed were genuine. [...] Even the copper coins were melted down and replaced with lightweight fakes. [...] The Royal Mint struck no copper coins for 48years, from 1773 until 1821. [...] The resultant gap was filled with copper tokens that approximated {{the size of the}} halfpenny, struck on behalf of merchants. [...] Boulton struck millions of these merchant pieces. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasions</b> when the Royal Mint did strike coins, they were relatively crude, with quality control nonexistent.|$|E
500|$|As in many countries, {{those with}} {{influence}} may receive favorable treatment before the law.

500|$|The Donkey Kong {{character}} was redesigned with a distinct, three-dimensional physical appearance. While borrowing the red necktie introduced in 1994's Game Boy version of Donkey Kong, the character featured {{a new look}} that would become the standard that continues {{to be used in}} nearly all games featuring him. Until Microsoft's purchase of Rare in 2002, all Nintendo games featuring Donkey Kong (including Mario Kart 64, Super Smash Bros., and the Mario Party series) credited Rare for the use of their Donkey Kong model. To develop Donkey Kong's movements in the game, Rare staff spent hours at nearby Twycross Zoo observing and videotaping real gorillas. However, they found that <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasions</b> when the gorillas moved, their movements were [...] "completely unsuitable for a fast-paced videogame", and so Donkey and Diddy Kong's animations were instead loosely based on how a horse gallops.|$|E
40|$|Vesico-uterine fistula is a {{very rare}} {{complication}} of lower caesarean section. There has only been two cases seen at the Department of Urology in the past 2 decades.

50|$|Karl is {{a middle-aged}} man that looks after Spot and lets him stay in his aquarium. Karl usually acts as the {{straight}} man for Spot's and Buddy's antics, knowing the flaws in the frogs' thoughts, but willing to play along with them anyway. Even <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasion</b> when he does question one of their ideas, he does so with a smirk and a raised eyebrow, more interested in their response than anything else.|$|R
