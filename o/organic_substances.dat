Dysprosium chloride fires, however, can be extinguished with water, while dysprosium fluoride and dysprosium oxide are non-flammable.

5|$|Silver metal {{is a good}} {{catalyst}} for oxidation reactions; {{in fact it is}} somewhat too good for most purposes, as finely divided silver tends to result in complete oxidation of <b>organic</b> <b>substances</b> to carbon dioxide and water, and hence coarser-grained silver tends to be used instead. For instance, 15% silver supported on α-Al2O3 or silicates is a {{catalyst for}} the oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide at 230–270°C. Dehydrogenation of methanol to formaldehyde is conducted at 600–720°C over silver gauze or crystals as the catalyst, as is dehydrogenation of isopropanol to acetone.
