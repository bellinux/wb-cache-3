5|$|A fluffernutter is a {{sandwich}} made {{with peanut butter}} and marshmallow fluff usually served <b>on</b> <b>white</b> bread. Variations of the sandwich include the substitution of wheat bread {{and the addition of}} various sweet, salty and savory ingredients. The term fluffernutter {{can also be used to}} describe other food items, primarily desserts, that incorporate peanut butter and marshmallow fluff.|$|E
5|$|The press {{themselves}} came in {{for some}} criticism in this respect, with the group Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting complaining that the Times and other media outlets focused {{on the effect of}} Nannygate <b>on</b> <b>white,</b> upper-middle-class women, and excluded the perspective of the actual immigrant childcare workers.|$|E
5|$|Caldas has a {{tradition}} of embroidery (bordado) possibly dating to the 15th century. Legend has it that Queen Leonor's handmaidens, seeing the monarch without her usual brilliance after selling off her jewellery, embroidered her cloak so that it appeared to have golden threads. Caldas embroidery is almost always made with three shades of molasses brown thread <b>on</b> <b>white</b> linen, and on rare occasion with white thread on brown linen. Known for its symmetry, the craft's common themes include arachnids, spirals, angles, birds, hearts, crowns, and shrimp nets.|$|E

5|$|Despite his {{popularity}} in the native community, White was portrayed negatively in the English-language press in his lifetime and in the published histories after his death. As a consequence of {{his opposition to the}} powers that overthrew the monarchy and later annexed the islands to the United States, White remains obscure in Hawaiian history. Recent research efforts in Hawaiian academia using Hawaiian language sources have shed more light <b>on</b> <b>White</b> and many other early Native Hawaiian resistant leaders like him.|$|E
5|$|Luke's face {{is widely}} {{considered}} to be a van der Weyden self-portrait. He may have wanted to associate himself both with a saint and with the founder of painting. This is reinforced by the fact that Luke is shown drawing in silverpoint <b>on</b> <b>white</b> paper; an extremely difficult medium that demands high concentration, and is normally used only for preparation. The artist is boldly emphasising his ability and skill with preparatory sketches; a single surviving silverpoint drawing attributed to van der Weyden, now in the Louvre, contains a female head very similar to Mary's in the Boston panel.|$|E
5|$|Manhattan is the {{economic}} engine of New York City, with its 2.3million workers in 2007 {{drawn from the}} entire New York metropolitan area accounting for almost two-thirds of all jobs in New York City. In {{the first quarter of}} 2014, the average weekly wage in Manhattan (New York County) was $2,749, representing the highest total among large counties in the United States. Manhattan's workforce is overwhelmingly focused <b>on</b> <b>white</b> collar professions, with manufacturing nearly extinct. Manhattan also has the highest per capita income of any county in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Republicans portrayed slavery as uncivilized {{and argued}} for {{abolition}} {{as a necessary}} step in national progress. Amendment supporters also argued that the slave system had negative effects <b>on</b> <b>white</b> people. These included the lower wages resulting from competition with forced labor, as well as repression of abolitionist whites in the South. Advocates said ending slavery would restore the First Amendment and other constitutional rights violated by censorship and intimidation in slave states.|$|E
5|$|Rhodium finds use in {{jewelry and}} for decorations. It is {{electroplated}} <b>on</b> <b>white</b> gold and platinum {{to give it}} a reflective white surface at time of sale, after which the thin layer wears away with use. This is known as rhodium flashing in the jewelry business. It may also be used in coating sterling silver to protect against tarnish (silver sulfide, Ag2S, produced from atmospheric hydrogen sulfide, H2S). Solid (pure) rhodium jewelry is very rare, more because of the difficulty of fabrication (high melting point and poor malleability) than because of the high price. The high cost ensures that rhodium is applied only as an electroplate.|$|E
5|$|Sullivan's Expedition helped {{stabilize}} {{the area and}} encouraged resettlement, which continued after the war. However, in 1787 there were only fourteen families in the valley: five on the river banks, five <b>on</b> <b>White</b> Deer Hole Creek between Spring Creek and the river, two on Spring Creek, and two on the creek west of Spring Creek. Six families left the area not long after 1787. The first grist mill {{was built on the}} creek in 1789, and four more were built in 1798, 1815, 1817, and 1842.|$|E

5|$|The aquarium's {{attempts}} to display captive white sharks ended in 2011 {{due to the}} project's high resource intensity. Captive white sharks also incurred injuries and killed other animals in the exhibit after becoming increasingly aggressive, and the final shark died due to unknown reasons following its release. Although no longer on exhibit for the public, aquarium scientists have continued to conduct research <b>on</b> <b>white</b> sharks. Collaborating with Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in June 2016, aquarium scientists created cameras attached to harmless dorsal fin tags {{in an attempt to}} study the behavior of white sharks during their gathering known as the White Shark Café.|$|E

5|$|German Kriegsmarine ships {{before the}} Second World War were either light gray overall or had dark gray hulls, and many {{retained}} this scheme during the war. The cruiser Deutschland, for instance, had a gray hull and light gray superstructure in 1934. Others had dazzle camouflage, usually in combinations of pale gray, dark gray and sea blue. For example, {{the hull of}} the battleship Scharnhorst had a dazzle pattern of stripes on a gray background in 1940, but some of these were later painted out, and the bows forward of the main guns painted black. Scharnhorst was not camouflaged against air observation, her decks fore and aft bearing large black <b>on</b> <b>white</b> swastikas on a red field; her main gun turrets had red (in the Baltic) or yellow tops for air recognition. The battleship Bismarck set out to Norway in dazzle camouflage; this was painted out with gray for her final trip to the Atlantic. The cruiser Admiral Scheer wore a low contrast pattern of irregular dark gray marks on light gray for her superstructure, with a dark gray hull, black waterline and, away from air support while out raiding in 1941, dark gray turret tops.|$|E
5|$|In December 1872, Colonel George Crook used Apache scouts {{to find a}} cave in Salt River Canyon {{that was}} being used by Guwevkabaya to mount attacks <b>on</b> <b>White</b> settlers. On December 28, {{accompanied}} by 100 Pima scouts, Captain William Brown led 120 of Crook's men to a siege of the cave. 110 Kwevkepaya were trapped in the cave, when Brown ordered the soldiers to fire at {{the roof of the}} cave, causing rock fragments and lead shrapnel to rain down on the Guwevkabaya. Having nowhere else to go, the besieged gathered around the mouth of the cave, where soldiers (accompanied by Crook) pushed boulders onto them from above, killing 76 of the group. The survivors were taken to Camp Grant as prisoners. The Yavapai were so demoralized by this and other actions by Crook that they surrendered at Camp Verde (renamed Fort McDowell), on April 6, 1873. In 1925, a group of Yavapai from the Fort McDowell Reservation, along with a Maricopa County Sheriff, collected the bones from the cave, and interred them at the Fort McDowell cemetery.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} compete with rival {{shipping}} company Cunard, the White Star Line offered their steerage passengers modest luxuries, {{in the hopes that}} emigrants would write to relatives back home and encourage them to travel <b>on</b> <b>White</b> Star Line ships. Third class passengers had their own dining facilities, with chairs instead of benches, and meals prepared by the third class kitchen staff. On other liners, the steerage passengers would have been expected to bring their own food. Rather than dormitory-style sleeping areas, third class passengers had their own cabins. The single men and women were separated, women in the stern in two to six berth cabins, men in the bow in up to ten berth cabins, often shared with strangers. Each stateroom was fitted with wood panelling and beds with mattresses, blankets, pillows, electric lights, heat and a washbasin with running water, except for the bow cabins which did not have a private washbasin. Two public bathtubs were also provided, one for the men, the other for women.|$|E
5|$|On Spectrum's {{airborne}} headquarters, Cloudbase, Spectrum commander-in-chief Colonel White {{concludes that}} Brown was a traitor and was concealing a bomb on his person. Unaware of the Mysterons' subversion of his officers, he orders Scarlet's reconstruction {{to fly the}} President to a second Maximum Security Building in London. When {{the body of the}} original Brown is discovered {{at the scene of the}} SPC crash, it dawns <b>on</b> <b>White</b> that the President is in the hands of an impostor, and that the person whom he believed to be Scarlet is not human. Ignoring instructions to return to Cloudbase, with his Spectrum Jet under fire from the Angel fighter squadron, the Scarlet duplicate ejects himself and the President over southern England; on the ground, both the duplicate and the President, the latter being held hostage, set off towards London in a stolen car.|$|E
5|$|Satisfied {{with his}} skills, the {{publishers}} asked Tolkien {{to design a}} dust jacket.

The runic inscription {{around the edges of the}} illustration are a phonetic transliteration of English, giving the title of the book and details of the author and publisher. The original jacket design contained several shades of various colours, but Tolkien redrew it several times using fewer colours each time. His final design consisted of four colours. The publishers, mindful of the cost, removed the red from the sun to end up with only black, blue, and green ink <b>on</b> <b>white</b> stock.|$|E
