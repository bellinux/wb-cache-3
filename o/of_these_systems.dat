Various techniques are used to track the sun and focus light.

5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century as {{telephone}} lines became available, it became popular to add telegraph onto telephone lines with an earth return phantom circuit. An LC filter was required to prevent telegraph clicks being heard on the telephone line. From the 1920s onwards, telephone lines, or balanced lines dedicated to the purpose, were used for FDM telegraph at audio frequencies. The first <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>systems</b> in the UK was a Siemens and Halske installation between London and Manchester. GEC and AT also had FDM systems. Separate pairs were used for the send and receive signals. The Siemens and GEC systems had six channels of telegraph in each direction, the AT system had twelve. All <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>systems</b> used electronic oscillators to generate a different carrier for each telegraph signal and required a bank of band-pass filters to separate out the multiplexed signal at the receiving end.|$|E

5|$|On October11, 2015, {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} weather traversed Central America {{and emerged}} over the eastern Pacific Ocean. The disturbance moved slowly {{over the next few}} days, later merging with a tropical wave on October15. The merger <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>systems</b> and the effects of a concurrent Tehuantepec gap wind event spurred the formation of a broad area of low pressure. This feature gradually consolidated and became a tropical depression shortly after 00:00UTC on October20; at this time the depression was situated roughly 205mi (335km) south-southeast of Salina Cruz, Mexico. A mid-level ridge to the north steered the depression generally west and later pulled it north along an arcing path.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} search radars installed {{were the}} SK air-search radar and SG surface-search radar during World War II.

As the war drew to a close, the United States introduced the SK-2 air-search radar and SG surface-search radar; the Iowa class was updated to make use <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>systems</b> between 1945 and 1952.

5|$|The safeworking of trains between {{stations}} on {{the early}} lines was time interval working, where a train {{would be allowed to}} leave a given time after the train before it. With heavier traffic this method became unsafe, with Staff and Ticket working on single lines adopted from 1873, and telegraph block working from 1878 on double lines. Both <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>systems</b> ensured that only one train would be in a section of track at one time. Telegraphic block working was then replaced with Winters Block working between 1883 and 1888, a system that is a predecessor of the Double line Block system which is still used today. Later years saw variations made to the Staff and Ticket system, with busier lines provided with Electric Staff working which provided greater safely when more trains ran.|$|E
