30|$|When <b>the</b> mesh <b>model</b> is {{simplified}} by the simplification method {{based on}} geometric elements, {{the higher the}} simplification rate, the more serious loss <b>of</b> <b>the</b> details <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>model,</b> and <b>the</b> detail features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>model</b> cannot be preserved. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> <b>model</b> simplification is to maintain <b>the</b> detail features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>model</b> to <b>the</b> maximum extent on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> reducing <b>the</b> scale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>model.</b> Based on <b>the</b> edge collapse method, an interactive method was proposed in this paper, which can effectively retain <b>the</b> detail features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>model</b> and make <b>the</b> <b>model</b> have higher identifiability.|$|R

5|$|With {{progress}} in palaeontology, the reputation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>models</b> declined. In 1895, the American fossil hunter Othniel Charles Marsh scorned the dinosaurs' friends as doing them a great injustice, and spoke angrily <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>models.</b> The models {{and the park}} fell into disrepair {{as the years went}} by, a process aided by the fire that destroyed the Crystal Palace itself in 1936, and the models became obscured by overgrown foliage. A full restoration of the animals was carried out in 1952 by Victor H.C. Martin, at which time the mammals on the third island were moved to less well-protected locations in the park, where they were exposed to wear and tear. The limestone cliff was blown up in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|About 260 {{models of}} lorry were produced, which were fitted with 35 types of engine, 20 {{different}} gearboxes, and 15 to 20 types of cabin. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>models</b> were produced in small numbers, with 116 types only being represented {{by one or}} two units. Most of the differences came from special wheelbases that always needed approval from the authorities. In many cases, it is impossible even for experts to identify different models and years of production. There were 66 types of bus chassis produced, {{and the number of}} different body types built on them by various coach builders and operators is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Hawkins benefited {{greatly from}} the public's {{reaction}} to the dinosaurs, which was so strong it allowed {{for the sale of}} sets of small versions of the dinosaur models, priced at £30 for educational use.

5|$|In October, {{the second}} unit {{travelled}} to Nassau to film the underwater sequences. To perform the car becoming a submarine, seven different models were used, {{one for each}} step of the transformation. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>models</b> was a fully mobile submarine equipped with an engine built by Miami-based Perry Submarines. The car seen entering the sea was a mock-up shell, propelled off the jetty by a compressed air cannon. During the model sequences, the air bubbles seen appearing from the vehicle were created by Alka-Seltzer tablets.|$|E
5|$|In shots {{where there}} was no {{perspective}} change, still shots <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>models</b> were photographed and positive paper prints were made.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we use the}} Kullback-Leibler {{divergence}} to measure the distance between <b>the</b> posteriors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> autoregressive (AR) <b>model</b> order, aiming to evaluate mathematically <b>the</b> sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>model</b> identification to different types <b>of</b> priors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>model</b> parameters. In particular, we consider three priors for <b>the</b> AR <b>model</b> coefficients, namely Jeffreys', g, and natural conjugate priors, and three priors for <b>the</b> <b>model</b> order including uniform, arithmetic, and geometric priors. Using {{a large number of}} Monte Carlo simulations with various values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>model</b> coefficients, model order, and sample size, we evaluate <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> posteriors distance in <b>the</b> accuracy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>model</b> identification. Simulation study results show that <b>the</b> posterior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>model</b> order is sensitive to prior distributions, and <b>the</b> highest accuracy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>model</b> identification is obtained from the posterior resulting from the g-prior.

5|$|Due to {{uncertainties}} {{about how}} the region's subtropical ridge would interact with Irene, the models continued to give unclear signals of the storm's future. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>models</b> predicted that Irene would make landfall in North Carolina, while others continued to anticipate that Irene would dissipate. The uncertainty ended when a weakness in the subtropical ridge allowed Irene to turn sharply northward, which caused the storm to pass midway between the Outer Banks of North Carolina and Bermuda on August 15. Soon after, upper-level shear weakened greatly, and Irene rapidly intensified, first to a hurricane, then to its peak strength as a 105mph (170km/h) Category 2 hurricane {{on the afternoon of}} August 16, while located 350miles (560km) northeast of Bermuda; {{at the same time it}} also attained minimum pressure of 970mbar.
