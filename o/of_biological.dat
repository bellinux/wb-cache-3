40|$|The {{existence}} <b>of</b> poor <b>biological</b> {{response to}} clopidogrel {{has been shown}} in some patients. Despite the increasing number of studies, this phenomenon remains difficult to quantify. We performed a systematic review to estimate the prevalence <b>of</b> poor <b>biological</b> response to clopidogrel and investigate the factors known to modulate this. An exhaustive search was performed. Altogether 171 publications were identified, providing data for a total of 45, 664 subjects. The estimated prevalence <b>of</b> poor <b>biological</b> response to clopidogrel ranged from 15. 9 % to 49. 5 % according to the platelet function assay employed. The assays most frequently used were light transmittance aggregometry (LTA), the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) assay and the Verifynow® assay. For all these assays, higher cut-off values were associated with a lower prevalence <b>of</b> poor <b>biological</b> response to clopidogrel. However, when choosing a fixed cut-off point for each assay, the prevalence <b>of</b> poor <b>biological</b> response to clopidogrel was highly variable suggesting that other factors could modulate poor biological response to clopidogrel. Finally, none of the studied factors could apparently explain the variability <b>of</b> poor <b>biological</b> response to clopidogrel. This meta-analysis shows that the prevalence <b>of</b> poor <b>biological</b> response depends on the assay employed, the cut-off value and on various unidentified additional factors...|$|R
40|$|Biologicals are a {{relatively}} new class of drugs and are important treatment options {{for a variety of}} chronic and/or serious conditions. Biologicals have different characteristics as compared to the traditional chemically synthesised drugs, which may result in different risk profiles and the need for different approaches in risk management. Post marketing collected safety data offers a valuable and necessary complement to the information obtained during the clinical trials. The objective of this thesis was to evaluate the risk management <b>of</b> <b>biologicals</b> from a regulatory and a clinical perspective. Therefore we studied the regulatory actions and activities undertaken for these drugs. It was found that at the moment of approval little is known on the safety profile <b>of</b> <b>biologicals</b> as compared to the traditional small molecule drugs. This underlines the need for active pharmacovigilance. In addition, different data sources are used for post-marketing pharmacoepidemiological studies <b>of</b> <b>biologicals</b> as compared to the small molecule drugs. Safety-related regulatory actions initiated for biologicals after use in the clinical setting showed that biologicals first to be approved in a therapeutic class where more prone to a regulatory action. Pharmacovigilance should especially be stringent for these biologicals. In addition, we found that safety-related regulatory actions could often be related to the pharmacological activity <b>of</b> the <b>biological</b> (e. g. adverse drug events (ADRs) related to infections and haematological malignancies) or to the protein nature of these agents (immunogenicity), indicating that biologicals have a different ADR profile as compared to the small molecule drugs. An analysis with spontaneously reported ADRs confirmed this finding regarding the nature of the ADRs. The risk management <b>of</b> <b>biologicals</b> was also studied from a clinical perspective in a cohort of rituximab users. We were interested in the identification of risk factors using clinical laboratory data as this can guide the clinician to identify patients susceptible for an ADR at an early stage. Invasive Aspergillosis (IA) and thrombocytopenia were studied. Patients treated with a higher cumulative dose of rituximab and a Candida infection in the 30 days before the diagnosis of IA had a higher risk for IA. These patients should especially be educated about activities to minimise the risk for fungal infections. The incidence of thrombocytopenia was found to be higher as compared to the clinical trials. Healthcare professionals should therefore consider thrombocytopenia as a relevant ADR during treatment with rituximab. Patients with {{a relatively}} low platelet count and/or treated with rituximab in the oncology indication as compared to the auto-immune indication where at an increased risk. More frequent monitoring of the thrombocyte count is advised. It was concluded that information on the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>biologicals</b> and their underlying ADR profile is important in regulatory and clinical risk management. Regulators should use knowledge obtained with other biologicals during the assessment <b>of</b> new <b>biological</b> agents. For clinical risk management, information on the safety profile <b>of</b> <b>biologicals</b> and use <b>of</b> risk factors can lead to a safer use of drugs in clinical practice and minimise the risk for the patient...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{considers}} the very urgent problem of optimization {{of the management}} of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients who have achieved remission (or persistent low disease activity) during therapy using biologicals. It analyzes the results of BeSt, OPTIMA, HIT HARD, ACT-RAY, AVERT, PRESERVE, RETRO, PRIZE, DRESS, HOPEFUL- 2, and HONOR studies, the data of NinJa and CORRONA registries, and the experience gained in treating psoriasis concerning practically important issues, such as whether tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors and biologicals with other mechanisms of action can be discontinued; whether the whole anti-inflammatory therapy can be stopped; whether the dose <b>of</b> <b>biologicals</b> can be reduced {{as an alternative to}} complete discontinuation or as a step to discontinue biologicals; whether repeated or intermittent therapy with biologicals can be used; what value of the depth of suppression of inflammatory activity is in solving the problem <b>of</b> whether <b>biologicals</b> can be discontinued. The current results may lead to the conclusion that in RA the dose <b>of</b> <b>biologicals</b> may be successfully reduced and, in some cases, the latter may be completely discontinued. This possibility seems {{to be associated with the}} depth of remission. Repeated use <b>of</b> <b>biologicals</b> generally gives rise to prompt improvement in patients with a recurrent disease-activity rebound. The results of a trial of etanercept are most optimistic. Re-treatment with biologicals generally provides fast improvement in patients with a relapse of disease activity. The results of the trials of etanercept are most optimistic...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Traceability is {{important}} in the postmarketing surveillance <b>of</b> <b>biologicals,</b> since changes in the manufacturing process may give rise to product- or batch-specific risks. With the expected expansion of the biosimilar market, there have been concerns about the ability to trace individual products within pharmacovigilance databases. Areas covered: The authors discuss the present challenges in the traceability <b>of</b> <b>biologicals</b> in relation to pharmacovigilance, by exploring the processes involved in ensuring traceability. They explore both the existing systems that are in place for the recording of exposure information in clinical practice, as well as the critical steps involved in the transfer of exposure data to various pharmacovigilance databases. Expert opinion: The existing systems ensure the traceability <b>of</b> <b>biologicals</b> down to the manufacturer within pharmacy records, but do not support the routine recording of batch information. Expected changes in supply chain standards provide opportunities to systematically record detailed exposure information. Spontaneous reporting systems are the most vulnerable link in ensuring traceability, due to the manual nature of data transfer. Efforts to improve the traceability should, in the short term, be focused toward encouraging health professionals and patients to systematically record and report detailed exposure information. Long-term solutions lie in expanding the accessibility to, and increasing the electronic exchange of exposure data...|$|R
