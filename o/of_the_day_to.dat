5|$|At {{the second}} {{practice}} session on Friday afternoon, Ferrari {{was able to}} reduce the gap to Mercedes, with Vettel third {{a little more than}} seven-tenths of a second behind Hamilton. Nico Rosberg was just 0.021 seconds off his teammate's time of 1m24.279s, even leading through the first two sectors but losing fastest time through the third and final sector. The two Force India cars of Sergio Pérez and Nico Hülkenberg split the two Ferrari drivers, with Kimi Räikkönen finishing in sixth. Max Verstappen was the second Toro Rosso driver <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> spin out into the gravel, but he was able to continue after losing control of his car at the Ascari chicane. There were technical problems for both Daniel Ricciardo and Jenson Button.

5|$|Continuing Navy's {{drive from}} the {{previous}} quarter, Polanco and Eckel continued to run up the middle and {{the right side of}} New Mexico's defense for small gains. Polanco attempted two passes, the first of which was incomplete and the second to slotback Marco Nelson for a first down at the Midshipmen 44-yard line. After 12 plays and over six minutes of game time, the drive reached midfield. After six more rushing plays from Polanco, Eckel, and slotback Eric Roberts, the team reached the Lobos' 28-yard line. Needing three yards to achieve a fourth down conversion, Navy coach Paul Johnson called a time-out. On the next play, Frank Divis threw his second halfback option pass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> Polanco, gaining six yards to keep the drive alive. Eckel, Divis, and Roberts rushed for six more plays before the drive came to a halt at the Lobos' 5-yard line. On the final play of the drive, Midshipman kicker Geoff Blumenfeld kicked a 22-yard field goal to make the score 34–19 with 2:07 left in the game.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} years of the silent film era, from the 1890s, films were {{generally}} accompanied by live music, often improvised, provided by piano or pump organ. In the early 20th century, larger cinemas began to use orchestras, which would accompany the film with out-of-copyright classical pieces or, increasingly, with original compositions. The score for the 1916 classic The Birth of a Nation, compiled by Joseph Carl Breil from various classical works and some original writing, was a landmark in film music, and inspired notable composers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> provide scores for silent films. Among these were the Americans Victor Herbert and Mortimer Wilson, from France Darius Milhaud and Arthur Honegger, and the Germans Gottfried Huppertz and Edmund Meisel.|$|E
5|$|It is well {{understood}} that, {{at the moment}} {{it is only a}} minimum, the Society is always free to put in place the number of trains necessary to transport passengers who present themselves, that if it will satisfy this requirement, its proper interest is guaranteed, and, in giving greater public satisfaction, its infrastructure will be wisely used, instead of it travelling empty for part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> the detriment of its business. Being given the lower frequency of service on weekdays and Saturdays, except Thursdays (racing), we can perfectly accept the reduction to ten trips to those going from the racecourse to the forest, but, concerning the part of the journey from Trianon to the racecourse, it is imperative that the Chief Engineer (Lechelas) keeps the minimum to 30, otherwise there will be a kind of abandonment of the line, because for this small distance, it will not be possible to get reasonable traffic with more frequent departures.|$|E
5|$|The Shrine {{went through}} a {{prolonged}} process of development which began in 1918 with the initial proposal to build a Victorian memorial. Two committees were formed, the second of which ran a competition for the memorial's design. The winner was announced in 1922. However, opposition to the proposal (led by Keith Murdoch and The Herald) forced the governments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> rethink the design, {{and a number of}} alternatives were proposed, the most significant of which was the ANZAC Square and cenotaph proposal of 1926. In response, General Sir John Monash used the 1927 ANZAC Day march to garner support for the Shrine, and finally won the support of the Victorian government later that year. The foundation stone was laid on 11 November 1927, and the Shrine was officially dedicated on 11 November 1934.|$|E

After laying 28 seconds down in the overall classification before the final day at the Tour de l'Ain, Moncoutié secured overall victory the next day. He missed out on the stage win to 's Thibaut Pinot, but by finishing only 3 seconds back he moved past previous race leader Wout Poels to win the event itself. Lastly, Gallopin took a stage at the Tour du Limousin. He took his second win of the season by breaking away from the peloton within stage's final kilometer, and holding on for first by 6 seconds.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper proposes <b>to</b> elect <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>to</b> pay {{accounts}} payable determinants and our findings strongly support that the {{accounts payable}} problematic {{is closely related}} to short term financial decisions with a positive and significative influence of firm’s profitability and size factors. <b>The</b> existence <b>of</b> a firm’s negative working capital is confirmed to influence strongly <b>the</b> reduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trade credit obtained from suppliers in Western Europe countries in parallel with a joint contribution of short and long term bank financing as a substitute from trade debt. Firm characteristics related to negative working capital and fixed assets level, jointly or alone, give more importance to <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> short term bank financing on substituting or reducing <b>the</b> volume <b>of</b> trade credit obtained from suppliers. Negative working capital reinforces <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> long term bank financing. It seems to induce <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> a corporate cost reduction strategy to preserve or increment the firm’s market reputation and competition. The firm’s return on assets implies an enlargement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>to</b> pay accounts payable in line with a rising creditworthiness. All interacted variables are responsible for <b>the</b> reduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>to</b> pay accounts payable and <b>the</b> confirmation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> financial substitution effect introduces more financing discipline compatible with firm’s cost reduction strategy and pricing motives included in a price discriminatio...|$|R

5|$|Dyer was {{a popular}} choice with boxing promoters, helped {{by the fact that}} after each bout he would sing Thora, a popular hit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> the audience. His careers as a pugilist and {{baritone}} earned him the nickname, 'The Singing Boxer'. His first few bouts were all held in south Wales, but by the autumn of 1910 he was travelling to England to fight, and on 10 October 1910 he was invited to fight at the National Sporting Club in Covent Garden, London. On 15 May 1911 Dyer was scheduled to fight Dick Emden at The Ring in Blackfriars, London. To date, Dyer had recorded over 15 bouts and was unbeaten but the fight with Emden ended in defeat and affected his future boxing career. Dyer was easily ahead in the bout, when in the fifth round he dislocated his knee and fell to the canvas in agony. Emden, who taunted the fallen Dyer, was given the victory and Dyer would not fight for another six months. The injury to his right knee plagued Dyer throughout his entire boxing career, and also stopped him serving in the armed forces during the First World War. After the injury, Dyer always fought with a protector strapped around his knee, and was forced to change his fighting style. He would always stand on the toes of his right foot, as a quick back step could possibly dislocate his knee again. His return bout in November 1911 was a win against Young Lilley at The Ring, but this was again followed by a long absence. Dyer did not fight again until 1 June 1912.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 12 July the {{combined}} French and Spanish squadron put to sea, followed closely by the British squadron. Both sides took most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> assemble, hampered by light winds and damaged warships, but at 19:00 Moreno gave orders for his squadron to make all sail westwards towards the open ocean and Cadiz. Saumarez followed, but at 20:40, with night drawing in and the wind picking up, he instructed Keats to take Superb, the fastest ship in his squadron, ahead and engage the rearguard of Moreno's force. At 23:20, Keats discovered the Real Carlos and pulled alongside, firing three broadsides into the Spanish ship that started a severe fire. Superb then pushed on towards Saint Antoine while Real Carlos drifted in darkness and confusion, encountering San Hermenegildo, the Spanish ships mistaking one another for an enemy and opening fire. Real Carlos then drifted into San Hermenegildo, the huge ships tangling together and the fire spreading {{from one to another}} until both were blazing wrecks in the darkness. They both exploded at 00:15 on 13 July, killing more than 1,700 men. At some stage during the night, the independently sailing Spanish frigate Perla sailed through the battle and was fatally damaged in the crossfire, sinking the next morning.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{most likely}} {{realised}} that this situation presented {{them with an}} opportunity to destroy an isolated part of the Persian fleet. Herodotus is not clear on where the Allies planned to meet this detachment, only that they resolved to do so. One possibility is that they planned to sail down the Straits of Euboea, and hope that the other Allied ships, patrolling the coast of Attica, followed the Persians as they entered the Straits of Euboea from the south; then the Persians might themselves be caught in a trap. Alternatively, the Allies may have planned to ambush the detachment as it passed by Artemisium, on its journey from Aphetae. Either way, they decided to make a demonstration towards the Persian lines during what remained <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>to</b> convince the Persians that they were planning to stay at Artemisium. Herodotus also suggests that this was an opportunity for them to assess Persian seamanship and tactics. The Allies probably waited until late afternoon so that there was little chance of being drawn into a full scale engagement; {{they did not want to}} suffer casualties before sailing to meet to the Persian detachment. These decisions finally led to the beginning of the battle.|$|E

5|$|Sir Nathaniel Curzon, later 1st Baron Scarsdale, {{commissioned}} Brettingham in 1759 {{to design}} a great country house. Thirty years before a prospective design for a new Kedleston Hall had been drawn up by James Gibbs, {{one of the leading}} architects of the day, but Curzon wanted his new house to match the style and taste of Holkham. Lord Leicester, Holkham's owner and Brettingham's employer, was a particular hero of Curzon's. Curzon was a Tory from a very old Derbyshire family, and he wished to create a showpiece to rival the nearby Chatsworth House owned by the Whig Duke of Devonshire, whose family were relative newcomers in the county, having arrived little more than two hundred years earlier. However, the Duke of Devonshire's influence, wealth, and title were far superior to Curzon's, and Curzon was unable to complete his house or to match the Devonshires' influence (William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire, had been Prime Minister in the 1750s). This commission might have been the ultimate accolade Brettingham was seeking, to recreate Holkham but this time with full credit. Kedleston Hall was designed by Brettingham on a plan by Palladio for the unbuilt Villa Mocenigo. The design by Brettingham, similar to that of Holkham Hall, was for a massive principal central block flanked by four secondary wings, each a miniature country house, themselves linked by quadrant corridors. From the outset of the project, Curzon seems to have presented Brettingham with rivals. In 1759, while Brettingham was still supervising the construction of the initial phase, the northeast family block, Curzon employed architect James Paine, the most notable architect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>to</b> supervise the kitchen block and quadrants. Paine also went on to supervise the construction of Brettingham's great north front. However, this was a critical moment for architecture in England. Palladianism was being challenged by a new taste for neoclassical designs, one exponent of which was Robert Adam. Curzon had met Adam as early as 1758, and had been impressed by the young architect newly returned from Rome. He employed Adam to design some garden pavilions for the new Kedleston. So impressed was Curzon by Adam's work that by April 1760 he had put Adam in sole charge of the design of the new mansion, replacing both Brettingham and Paine. Adam completed the north facade of the mansion much as Brettingham had designed it, only altering Brettingham's intended portico. The basic layout of the house remained loyal to Brettingham's original plan, although only two of the proposed four secondary wings were executed.|$|E
