5|$|Interesting, perhaps, {{in the use}} {{of weapons}} in these recent “revolutionary” works is that they are, {{generally}} speaking, not reenactments of traditional folk dances.

5|$|Taraki was {{appointed}} Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> Council and Chairman of the Council of Ministers while retaining his post as PDPA general secretary. He initially formed a government {{which consisted of}} both Khalqists and Parchamites; Karmal became Deputy Chairman of the Presidium <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> Council while Amin became Minister of Foreign Affairs and Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers. Internal problems soon arose and several prominent Khalqists accused the Parcham faction of conspiring against the Taraki government. A Khalqi purge of the Parcham then began with the faction's most prominent members being sent out of the country: Karmal became Afghan Ambassador to Czechoslovakia and Mohammad Najibullah became Afghan Ambassador to Iran. Internal struggle was not only to be found between the Khalqist and Parchamites; tense rivalry between Taraki and Amin had begun in the Khalq faction with both vying for control.|$|E
5|$|The Admiralty's 1905 draft {{building}} plan envisioned four battleships in the 1906–1907 Naval Programme, {{but the new}} Liberal government cut one of these ships in mid-1906.

5|$|After the Saur revolution, Taraki was {{appointed}} Chairman of the Presidium <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> Council and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and retained his post as PDPA general secretary. Taraki initially formed a government {{which consisted of}} both Khalqists and Parchamites; Karmal became Deputy Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> Council while Amin became Minister of Foreign Affairs and a Deputy Prime Minister, and Mohammad Aslam Watanjar became a Deputy Prime Minister. The two Parchamites Abdul Qadir and Mohammad Rafi became Minister of National Defence and Minister of Public Works respectively. According to Angel Rasanayagam, the appointment of Amin, Karmal and Watanjar as Deputy Prime Ministers led {{to the establishment of}} three cabinets; the Khalqists were answerable to Amin, the Parchamites were answerable to Karmal, and the military officers (who were Parchamites) were answerable to Watanjar. The first conflict between the Khalqists and Parchamites arose when the Khalqists wanted to give PDPA Central Committee membership to the military officers who participated in the Saur Revolution. Amin, who had previously opposed the appointment of military officers to the PDPA leadership, switched sides; he now supported their elevation. The PDPA Politburo voted in favour of giving membership to the military officers; the victors (the Khalqists) portrayed the Parchamites as opportunists, implying that the Parchamites had ridden the revolutionary wave, but not actually participated in the revolution. To make matters worse for the Parchamites, the term Parcham was, according to Taraki, a word synonymous with factionalism.|$|E
5|$|An {{articulate}} {{expression of}} Greek republicanism {{can be found}} in the works <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>revolutionary</b> author Rigas Feraios. Feraios' execution in 1798 at the hands of the Ottomans gave an aura of heroism to these political ideas, which also visualized the liberation of Greece in the context of political reforms. In addition to Feraios' writings, other works in the same polemical style took on a sharper revolutionary character, as social contradictions in the Ottoman Empire grew.|$|E

5|$|Ann Eliza Bleecker's {{pastoral}} poems exemplified a {{new style}} of American poetry, and, due to her experience of the American Revolutionary tumult, {{a new sense of}} national identity. These poems, written in the pastoral tradition, conveyed both the beauty of the colonial New York countryside and the horrific impact of war, suffering, death, and destruction. Because Bleecker was writing from the interesting perspective of a terrified young mother, her articulate depictions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> War are still read by historians today.|$|E

His interactions with Soviet revolutionaries led him to Baku, where he became the co-editor for the Armenian-language newspaper Sotsyal-Demokrat and later for the Russian-language paper Izvestia Bakinskogo Soveta.

Although heavily outnumbered, Americans repelled the Shawnee warriors in the Siege of Boonesborough. Boone {{was elected to the}} first of his three terms in the Virginia General Assembly, during the Revolutionary War, and fought in the Battle of Blue Licks in 1782.
