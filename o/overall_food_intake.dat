40|$|Total {{parenteral}} nutrition (TPN) inhibits <b>food</b> <b>intake</b> and feeding behavior. Whether caloric sensory {{function of the}} liver contributes to this <b>food</b> <b>intake</b> and feeding behavior regulation via vagal-afferent innervation was tested after performing anterior hepatic vagotomy or sham operation in rats infused with a TPN solution providing 100 % of daily energy needs, given continuously for 4 days. <b>Food</b> <b>intake,</b> meal number, size, duration, meal and intermeal sniffs, and eating activity were measured using an automated computerized rat eater meter (ACREM). TPN infusion resulted in a significant decrease of <b>food</b> <b>intake</b> and feeding indexes in both groups. The vagotomized rats showed a significantly higher food consumption, achieved by greater meal frequency, larger meal size, and longer meal duration. Thus, vagotomized rats consumed more than their controls by eating larger meals more often and of longer duration.

These ratios and results are not consistent with many other species and even conflict with some.

Nevertheless, intermittent fasting resulted in beneficial effects that met or exceeded those of caloric restriction including reduced serum glucose and insulin levels and increased resistance of neurons in the brain to excitotoxic stress.

40|$|International audienceDynamics of {{body weight}} and <b>food</b> <b>intake</b> can be studied by {{temporally}} perturbing food availability.

40|$|Background: Dialysis {{patients}} {{are at risk}} of vitamin and mineral deficiencies, not only because of losses during chronic hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis but also because of low intakes. Objective: The objective was to determine the importance of urea clearance (calculated as K t/V) and residual renal function (RRF) in predicting micronutrient intakes in a large cohort of patients receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Design: We conducted a survey of dietary intakes in 242 CAPD patients and divided them into 3 groups according to their weekly urea clearance and RRF: WD group (n = 84), a urea clearance ≥ 1. 7 and a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥ 1 mL · min - 1 · 1. 73 m - 2; DD group (n = 71), a urea clearance ≥ 1. 7 and a GFR < 1 mL · min - 1 · 1. 73 m - 2; and ID group (n = 87), a urea clearance < 1. 7. Results: Most of the patients had intakes of water-soluble vitamins and minerals that were lower than the recommended dietary allowance; most intakes were significantly higher in the WD group than in the DD and ID groups, except those of niacin and calcium. After age, sex, body weight, and the presence of diabetes were controlled for, total weekly urea clearance and the GFR (but not peritoneal dialysis urea clearance) were significantly associated with intakes of vitamins A and C, the B vitamins, and minerals (calcium, phosphate, iron, and zinc). Low intakes of vitamins and minerals with low RRF and urea clearance were the result of reduced <b>overall</b> <b>food</b> <b>intakes,</b> except for thiamine, vitamin B- 6, and folic acid, which were deficient in the diet. Conclusions: Supplementation with most water-soluble vitamins and minerals, including iron and zinc, should be considered in CAPD patients, especially those with low RRF and low urea clearance. The optimal dose needs to be determined. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Rats {{lived in}} {{individual}} chambers {{in which the}} only food available was delivered for lever pressing. During Stage I, a fixed number of presses was required for each food pellet. As this fixed ratio of presses per food pellet was increased daily, a rat's daily <b>intake</b> of <b>food</b> was reduced. During Stage II, {{the cost of a}} food pellet was increased by replacing each fixed ratio with its interval equivalent. Each interval was a rat's mean time between the first press of a ratio and the delivery of a pellet during Stage I. During Stage II, only two presses were every required for a food pellet: The first press initiated a delay and the second activated the pellet dispenser after that delay elapsed. <b>Food</b> <b>intakes</b> for the series of fixed ratios and a rat's series of delay equivalents were very similar when plotted as a function of delay, but not when plotted as a function of presses per pellet. Consequently, the fixed ratio reduced <b>food</b> <b>intake</b> because larger ratios increased delay to food from the first press of a ratio. Observations and an analysis of interresponse times further revealed that as the fixed ratio increased, and local as well as <b>overall</b> rate of <b>food</b> <b>intake</b> decreased, lever pressing became more stereotyped. Because this increased stereotypy resulted in greatly increased rates of lever pressing, delay to food was minimized, and perhaps more importantly, so too was the reduction of a rat's baseline daily intake...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} (very) low food security among Dutch food bank recipients, and to identify potential demographic, lifestyle and nutrition-related factors associated with (very) low food security. Setting: 11 of 135 Dutch food banks were selected throughout the Netherlands. Participants: 251 Dutch food bank recipients {{participated in the study}} (93 men and 158 women). Inclusion criteria for participation were: (1) at least 18 years of age, (2) sufficiently fluent in Dutch to participate in oral and written interviews, (3) recipient of a Dutch food bank for at least 1 month and (4) collect own food parcel at the food bank. A single member per household was included. Primary outcome: Level of food security. Results: The prevalence of food insecurity was 72. 9 % (N= 183), of which 40. 4 % (N= 74) reported very low food security. Of the very low food secure participants, 56. 8 % (N= 42) reported they were ever hungry but did not eat because they could not afford enough food in the previous 3 months. Adjusted multinomial logistic regression analyses showed that households without children were less likely to experience low food security (OR 0. 39 (95 % CI 0. 18 to 0. 88)) and men (OR 0. 24 (95 % CI 0. 11 to 0. 51)) were less likely to experience very low food security, while low-educated recipients (OR 5. 05 (95 % CI 1. 37 to 18. 61)) were more likely to experience very low food security. Furthermore, recipients with high satisfaction with <b>overall</b> <b>food</b> <b>intake</b> (OR 0. 46 (95 % CI 0. 27 to 0. 78)), high perceived healthiness of <b>overall</b> <b>food</b> <b>intake</b> (OR 0. 34 (95 % CI 0. 19 to 0. 62)) or high self-efficacy of eating healthy (OR 0. 62 (95 % CI 0. 40 to 0. 96)) were less likely to experience very low food security. Conclusions: Our study showed high prevalence rates of food insecurity among Dutch food bank recipients, and identified subgroups at increased risk of food insecurity.

40|$|Stress {{is thought}} to {{influence}} human eating behavior and has been examined in animal and human studies. Our understanding of the stress-eating relation is confounded by limitations inherent in the study designs; however, we can make some tentative conclusions that {{support the notion that}} stress can influence eating patterns in humans. Stress appears to alter <b>overall</b> <b>food</b> <b>intake</b> in two ways, resulting in under- or overeating, which may be influenced by stressor severity. Chronic life stress seems to be associated with a greater preference for energy- and nutrient-dense foods, namely those that are high in sugar and fat. Evidence from longitudinal studies suggests that chronic life stress may be causally linked to weight gain, with a greater effect seen in men. Stress-induced eating may be one factor contributing to the development of obesity. Future studies that measure biological markers of stress will assist our understanding of the physiologic mechanism underlying the stress-eating relation and how stress might be linked to neurotransmitters and hormones that control appetite. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In humans, {{skipping}} meals, especially breakfast, {{has been}} associated with obesity and other related syndromes. Recent studies in rodents suggest that fasting and feeding times are potential factors that affect the peripheral circadian clocks and metabolism. However, the link between fasting and obesity in rodents has yet to be fully demonstrated. Method We conducted early nocturnal fasting (ENF) from zeitgeber time (ZT) 12 to 18 for 4 consecutive days in C 57 B 6 mice. The first set of experiments was performed under ad libitum conditions, where ENF and free-feeding (FF) control groups were compared. The second set was performed under isocaloric adjustment by restricting the diet to 90 % of the basal intake of ENF mice. Calorie-restricted ENF (ENF-CR) mice were then compared with isocaloric controls (IC-control). Body weight, <b>food</b> <b>intake,</b> core body temperature, activity, adiposity, and clock-related gene expression levels in the liver and adipose tissues were investigated. A stable isotopic analysis was also conducted to estimate de novo lipogenesis fluxes. Results In the ad libitum condition, the ENF mice ate more during the day, increased their <b>overall</b> daily <b>food</b> <b>intake</b> and gained more weight than FF-control mice. The amplitude of the body core temperature rhythm in ENF mice was also lower than in the FF-controls. Under isocaloric conditions, ENF-CR attenuated the CR-induced body weight loss, compared with the IC-control. ENF-CR also altered the acrophase time of the expression of the clock genes, which is associated with time-shift of genes involved in lipid metabolism and increased lipogenesis, compared with the IC-control. Conclusions ENF in nocturnal mice disturbs the peripheral clock and increases de novo lipid synthesis and results in a predisposition to obesity. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to investigate the}} feeding ecology of the intensively exploited semi-terrestrial crab Ucides cordatus cordatus, and to contribute to the understanding of its influence on the flow of organic matter, nutrients, and energy in a mangrove ecosystem in northern Brazil. The mangrove crab U. cordatus is the most conspicuous species of the benthos, contributing to about 84 % of its biomass. Stomach content analyses showed that the crabs´ diet is mainly composed of mangrove leaves, unidentified plant material, roots, and sediment. The gut evacuation rates were used in conjunction with the mean daily gastrointestinal contents to calculate the daily <b>food</b> <b>intake</b> of U. cordatus. The daily <b>food</b> <b>intake</b> was 1. 0 g dw in small males (cw 3. 0 - 3. 5 cm), corresponding to 19. 8 % of the crabs´ body dry weight. Large males (cw 7. 0 - 7. 5 cm) consumed 3. 3 g dw daily, corresponding to 6. 0 % of their body dry weight. The <b>overall</b> daily <b>food</b> <b>intake</b> of the U. cordatus population at an Rhizophora mangle dominated forest stand was estimated as 4. 1 g dw m- 2, corresponding to 81. 3 % of the daily litter and propagule production. This indicates that litter processing by U. cordatus highly influences the flux of organic matter, leading to the retention of nutrients and energy inside the mangrove forest. High litter removal rates of the crabs, a low quantity of litter material in most investigated burrows, and high consumption rates during field experiments indicate that the U. cordatus population is food-limited in the investigated areas. Crabs maintained on a pure R. mangle diet showed higher assimilation efficiencies than those fed on Avicennia germinans leaves. Energy assimilation by the U. cordatus population was 10291 and 2870 kJ m- 2 y- 1 in an R. mangle and A. germinans dominated forest, respectively. The role of microorganisms for the nutrition of U. cordatus was investigated by using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes...|$|R
40|$|The strongest BMI–associated GWAS locus {{in humans}} is the FTO gene. Rodent studies {{demonstrate}} {{a role for}} FTO in energy homeostasis and body composition. The phenotypes observed in loss of expression studies are complex with perinatal lethality, stunted growth from weaning, and significant alterations in body composition. Thus understanding how and where Fto regulates <b>food</b> <b>intake,</b> energy expenditure, and body composition is a challenge. To address this we generated a series of mice with distinct temporal and spatial loss of Fto expression.

When ratio corrected for lean mass, mice had a significant increase in energy expenditure, but more appropriate multiple linear regression normalisation showed no difference in energy expenditure. Global deletion of Fto after the in utero and perinatal period, at 6 weeks of age, removed the high lethality of germline loss. However, there was a reduction in weight by 9 weeks, primarily as loss of lean mass. Over the subsequent 10 weeks, weight converged, driven by an increase in fat mass.

Method: Using the EDY-Q, a total of 1444 children aged 8 - 13 years were screened in elementary schools in Switzerland via self-report. The factor analysis of the 12 items covering ARFID related symptoms was performed using a principal component analysis (PCA). Results: The PCA showed a four factor solution, with clear allocation to the scales covering three variants of early-onset restrictive eating disturbances and weight problems.

This paper examines in a socioeconomic homogenous low-income low-education group of females the relation between dietary fiber intake and overweight and scrutinizes if the level of underreporting is equally large in normal-weight and overweight groups. Thirty-four female health care workers classified as either normal-weight () or obese () based on BMI, fat percentage, and waist circumference participated. A detailed food-diary was used to record their dietary intake in 9 days.

40|$|Despite {{their common}} use as model organisms in {{scientific}} experiments, {{pain and suffering}} in insects remains controversial and poorly understood. Here we explore potential pain experience in honeybees (Apis mellifera) by testing the self-Administration of an analgesic drug. Foragers were subjected to {{two different types of}} injuries: (i) a clip that applied continuous pressure to one leg and (ii) amputation of one tarsus. The bees were given a choice between two feeders, one offering pure sucrose solution, the other sucrose solution plus morphine. We found that sustained pinching had no effect on the amount of morphine consumed, and hence is unlikely to be experienced as painful. The amputated bees did not shift their relative preference towards the analgesic either, but consumed more morphine and more solution in total compared to intact controls. While our data do not provide evidence for the self-Administration of morphine in response to pain, they suggest that injured bees increase their <b>overall</b> <b>food</b> <b>intake,</b> presumably to meet the increased energy requirements for an immune response caused by wounding. We conclude that further experiments are required to gain insights into potential pain-like states in honeybees and other insects...|$|E

40|$|Background: Studies {{have shown}} that {{hormonal}} fluctuations that occur over the estrous cycle in rats affect <b>food</b> <b>intake.</b> It is possible that estrogen affects <b>food</b> <b>intake</b> via Opioid system and other brain areas which are involved in regulation of <b>food</b> <b>intake.</b> Therefore it may affect the sensitivity of female rats to hypophagic effect of Opioid antagonist Naloxone.

Methods: Basal <b>food</b> <b>intake</b> of 40 healthy adult females and 20 healthy adult male rats was recorded. Then they were injected intraperitoneally with Naloxone after fasting for 24 hrs. In female rats <b>food</b> <b>intake</b> was measured during different phases of the estrous cycle. All the rats were then subjected to gonadectomy. The <b>food</b> <b>intake</b> was measured after gonadectomy. The effect of Naloxone was also measured in deprivation paradigm after gonadectomy. Results: Female rats showed decreased <b>food</b> <b>intake</b> during proestrous and estrous phases. In female rats there was no hypophagia after Naloxone injection during these phases.

40|$|Malnutrition is {{a common}} cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality in captive giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis). Frothy bloat, a nutrition-related disease of domestic ruminants, has not previously been reported in Giraffidae. A 10 -year-old female reticulated giraffe (G. c. reticulata) had a chronic cough and died in February 2007 following a two-month period of weight loss. Multiple nutrition-related abnormalities were identified post mortem: frothy bloat appeared to have been the immediate cause of death; there was no fibrous material in the forestomachs; and rumen contents were mildly acidotic. There was also serous atrophy of multiple fat deposits and acute exudative interstitial pneumonia. The giraffe’s low (structured) fibre intake was associated with provision of ad libitum (ad lib) pelleted food, lucerne hay that had appeared unpalatable, and insufficient browse. The low fibre intake would have predisposed to frothy bloat and ruminal acidosis. Serous fat atrophy (emaciation) was probably due to inadequate <b>overall</b> <b>food</b> <b>intake</b> (associated with respiratory disease, frothy bloat and rumen acidosis) and increased energy demands (respiratory disease and winter temperatures).

40|$|The {{macronutrient}} {{composition of}} the diet {{has been shown to}} affect food intake, with proteins having distinct effects. The present study investigated the effect of diet supplementation with individual amino acids (tryptophan, lysine, arginine, proline and threonine) on meal pattern among male rats. Meal pattern and body weight were monitored for two weeks. Proline and threonine had minimal effects on meal pattern, while the most pronounced changes were observed in the tryptophan group. Both tryptophan and lysine decreased <b>overall</b> <b>food</b> <b>intake,</b> which was translated into a reduction in body weight. The reduced food intake of the tryptophan group was associated with an increase in meal size, intermeal intervals (IMI) and meal time and a decrease in meal number. The decrease in the food intake of the lysine group was associated with a reduction in both IMI and meal number, and this was accompanied by an increase in meal time. Arginine increased meal number, while decreasing IMI. Proline and threonine had a minimal effect on meal pattern. Lysine seems to increase satiety, and arginine seems to decrease it, while tryptophan seems to increase satiety and decrease satiation. Accordingly, changes in meal patterns are associated with the type of amino acid added to the diet...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Foraging {{behaviour}} is {{an essential}} ecological process linking different trophic levels. A central assumption of foraging theory is that food selection maximises the fitness of the consumer. It remains unknown, however, whether animals use innate or learned behaviour to discriminate food rewards. While many studies demonstrated that previous experience is a strong determinant of complex food choices such as diet mixing, the response to simple nutritional stimuli, such as sugar concentrations, is often believed to be innate. Results Here we show that previous experience determines the ability to track changes in sugar composition in same-aged individuals of a short-lived migratory songbird, the garden warbler (Sylvia borin). Although birds received identical foods for seven {{months prior to the}} experiment, wild-caught birds achieved higher sugar intake rates than hand-raised birds when confronted with alternative, differently coloured, novel food types. Hand-raised and wild birds did not differ in their initial colour selection or <b>overall</b> <b>food</b> <b>intake,</b> but wild birds were quicker to adjust food choice to varying sugar intake. Conclusion Over a period of at least seven months, broader previous experience translates into a higher plasticity of food choice leading to higher nutrient intake. Our results thus highlight the need to address previous long-term experience in foraging experiments. Furthermore, they show that hand-raised animals are often poor surrogates for testing the foraging behaviour of wild animals. </p...|$|E

40|$|Reproduction {{has been}} shown to be costly in {{viviparous}} skinks, both in terms of survival and in terms of growth and future reproductive output. One possible source of such costs could be a reduction in <b>food</b> <b>intake,</b> with an associated reduction in energy available for maintenance and future reproduction. Therefore, I compared <b>food</b> <b>intake</b> in male and female southern water skinks (Eulamprus tympanum), to determine whether <b>food</b> <b>intake</b> was reduced during reproduction in either sex. In addition, I measured the relationship between reduction in <b>food</b> <b>intake</b> and the total volume of offspring or testis. A reduction in <b>food</b> <b>intake</b> proportional to the volume of offspring suggests that costs associated with reduced energy intake may be fecundity dependent. <b>Food</b> <b>intake</b> was estimated using the total volume of stomach contents of individuals. Females ate significantly less (mean volume of stomach contents = 0. 13 mL) than males (mean = 0. 36 mL) just before parturition in January, when embryos were largest. After parturition, females ate significantly more than males. Otherwise, there were no significant differences between the <b>food</b> <b>intake</b> of males and females. Females reduced <b>food</b> <b>intake</b> by eating smaller food items. Females with relatively large numbers of ova or embryos ate relatively less, and therefore decreased <b>food</b> <b>intake</b> in females may be a fecundity-dependent cost of reproduction in these lizards. Males did not reduce <b>food</b> <b>intake</b> during periods when testes were enlarged and mating occurred. Decreased <b>food</b> <b>intake</b> during reproduction is probably an important source of reproductive costs to females of these viviparous lizards, but does not appear to be important in males...|$|R
40|$|Postoperative {{hyperplasia}} enhances experimental intestinal carcinogenesis, but {{the effects}} of nonsurgical adaptation are uncertain. The tropic and tumour-promoting potentials of moderate hypothermia were tested in two groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats housed at 10 degrees C for 30 weeks. One group (n = 10) received a 6 -week course of azoxymethane (total dose 90 mg kg- 1). The second group (n = 7) acted as hypothermic controls. Another 2 groups maintained at 22 degrees C received azoxymethane (n = 15) or served as normothermic controls (n = 15). <b>Overall</b> <b>food</b> <b>intake</b> was 42 % higher in the hypothermic groups, yet at sacrifice mean body weight was 13 % lower (P less than 0. 01). Hypothermia and azoxymethane combined to produce the following increases in crypt cell production rate (CCPR), as determined stathmokinetically: duodenum 170 %, jejunum 172 %, ileum 74 %, proximal colon 227 % (P = 0. 05 - 0. 01). Independently hypothermia had no effect, but azoxymethane produced 76 - 156 % increases in CCPR throughout the large intestine. Although hypothermia did not affect overall tumour yield, the mean diameter of proximal colonic tumours was increased by 65 % (P less than 0. 05). In rats receiving azoxymethane, hypothermia stimulates cell proliferation in the small bowel {{as well as in}} the proximal colon, where it has a correspondingly mild cocarcinogenic effect...|$|E
40|$|Behavioural mimicry is a {{potential}} mechanism explaining why adolescents appear {{to be influenced by}} their parents' eating behaviour. In the current study we examined whether there is evidence that adolescent females mimic their parents when eating. Videos of thirty-eight parent and female adolescent dyads eating a lunchtime meal together were examined. We tested whether a parent placing a food item into their mouth was associated with an increased likelihood that their adolescent child would place any food item (non-specific mimicry) or the same item (specific mimicry) in their mouth at three different time frames, namely, during the same second or within the next fifteen seconds (+ 15), five seconds (+ 5) or two second (+ 2) period. Parents and adolescents' <b>overall</b> <b>food</b> <b>intake</b> was positively correlated, whereby a parent eating a larger amount of food was associated with the adolescent eating a larger meal. Across all of the three time frames adolescents were more likely to place a food item in their mouth if their parent had recently placed that same food item in their mouth (specific food item mimicry); however, {{there was no evidence of}} non-specific mimicry. This observational study suggests that when eating in a social context there is evidence that adolescent females may mimic their parental eating behaviour, selecting and eating more of a food item if their parent has just started to eat that food...|$|E
40|$|Ghrelin, an {{endogenous}} appetite hormone, is secreted {{from the}} gastro-intestinal tract, and the ghrelin-induced appetite is conveyed through the afferent vagus nerves. However, {{it has not}} been elucidated how the orexigenic sensation produced by ghrelin is transmitted to the afferent vagus nerves that innervate gastro-intestinal tract. To address this issue, ghrelin-induced food intake in Wister rats was evaluated in {{the presence or absence of}} vagal denervation or the administration of a type- 3 serotonin receptor antagonist ramosetoron. Cumulative food intake was significantly increased 1 hr and 2 hr after the intraperitoneally-applied ghrelin (20 μg/kg). Desensitization of C-fiber of the afferent vagus nerves by intraperitoneally-applied capsaicin completely abolished the increases in the ghrelin-induced food intake. Surgical vagotomy of the hepatic or gastric branches markedly suppressed the ghrelin-evoked feeding. Furthermore, pretreatment with ramosetoron also significantly suppressed the ghrelin-evoked feeding. Stimulatory effects of ghrelin on the appetite were transient and the <b>overall</b> <b>food</b> <b>intake</b> was comparable after 24 hr among all groups. These data suggest that 1) exogenous ghrelin rapidly promotes feeding, but such feeding lasts no more than 2 hr; 2) afferent C-fiber of the hepatic or gastric vagus nerves appear to convey ghrelininduced hungry sensation to the brain; 3) type- 3 serotonin receptors at the nerve endings of the C-fiber of the gastric or hepatic afferent vagus nerves may involve in transmitting the ghrelin-evoked hungry sensation...|$|E

Leader: RNDr Jara Nedvídková, CSc., Endocrinology institute. Special Consultant: Doc RNDR. Stanislav Vybíral, CSc. This work is devoted to one of new hormones involved in regulation of <b>food</b> <b>intake</b> - Ghrelin. The main scope of this work is monitoring relationships between individual forms of Ghrelin and macronutrients received in food (proteins, carbohydrates). <b>Food</b> <b>intake,</b> conditioned by feeling of hunger and satiety, {{is a very complex}} physiological process. Hormones of gastrointestinal tract, adipose tissue and neuropeptides of central nervous system, together participate in <b>food</b> <b>intake,</b> including inducing of feeling of hunger and satiety. At the same time, mutual diffusion of signals reflecting actual energy <b>food</b> <b>intake</b> and long-term <b>food</b> supply of the organism play their roles (Stradel and Woods, 2005). Defects of this signalisation may participate in causing failure in <b>food</b> <b>intake</b> such as Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia nervosa or Obesity, and their persistency. Psycho- behavioural factors play equally significant role in <b>food</b> <b>intake</b> (Elfang and Rösner et al., 2005).

40|$|Many {{physiological}} and behavioral changes take place during pregnancy, including changes in taste {{and an increase}} in <b>food</b> <b>intake.</b> These changes are necessary to ensure growth and development of a healthy fetus. Both hyperphagia and taste changes during pregnancy may be induced by sex hormones estrogen and progesterone that are increased during pregnancy. Indeed, {{it has been shown that}} estrogen decreases <b>food</b> <b>intake,</b> while progesterone increases <b>food</b> <b>intake.</b> This is for instance apparent from the fact that <b>food</b> <b>intake</b> changes during the menstrual cycle with variation in sex hormones.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effects of}} {{intraperitoneal}} injections of tryptophan on <b>food</b> <b>intake</b> in the chicken were examined. Four levels of tryptophan (12. 5, 25, 50, 100 mg), and a saline control {{were tested in}} birds that were ad libitum fed or fasted 24 hr. The tryptophan treatments decreased <b>food</b> <b>intake</b> in the ad libitum-fed chickens in a dose-dependent manner. <b>Food</b> <b>intake</b> of the 24 -hr fasted chickens was not influenced by the tryptophan injections. It is not known whether trypto-phan is acting centrally or peripherally to decrease <b>food</b> <b>intake</b> of ad libitum-fed chickens.
