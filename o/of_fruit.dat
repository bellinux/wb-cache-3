40|$|Minority {{communities}} across the United States have limited numbers of stores that offer a variety <b>of</b> <b>fruits</b> and vegetables, creating major barriers to good eating habits and nutritional practices among minority groups such as African Americans. Factors like environmental availability of healthy food options have not been fully investigated as possible sources of current cross-population differences in disease. The present study examined whether a predominantly African American neighborhood had disproportionately less availability <b>of</b> <b>fruits</b> and vegetables than a predominantly non-Hispanic White neighborhood. Availability was judged on the bases {{of the types of}} stores available in each community and the specific types <b>of</b> <b>fruits</b> and vegetables made available in each store. The availability <b>of</b> <b>fruits</b> and vegetables in the food stores of each community was assessed by physically canvassing neighborhood food stores and taking a census <b>of</b> available <b>fruit</b> and vegetable items based on a list <b>of</b> <b>fruits</b> and vegetables derived from the DASH diet. The predominantly African American community under study had fewer varieties <b>of</b> fresh <b>fruits</b> and vegetables and fewer stores offering larger varieties <b>of</b> <b>fruits</b> and vegetables. Reduced choice to purchase fruits and vegetables among minority populations potentially increases health disparities. Improving local food environments is one important strategy to increase access to a healthy diet in minority communities...|$|R

5|$|Fruit {{was popular}} {{and could be}} served fresh, dried, or preserved, and was a common {{ingredient}} in many cooked dishes. Since sugar and honey were both expensive, it was common to include many types <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> in dishes that called for sweeteners of some sort. The fruits of choice in the south were lemons, citrons, bitter oranges (the sweet type was not introduced until several hundred years later), pomegranates, quinces, and, of course, grapes.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify the linear relationship between cherry tomato yield components. Two uniformity trials, without treatments, were conducted on Lilli cherry tomato plants in a plastic greenhouse during the 2014 spring/summer season, with the plants in two stems. Variables observed for each plant were mean fruit length, mean fruit width, mean <b>fruit</b> weight, number <b>of</b> bunches, number <b>of</b> <b>fruits</b> per bunch, total number <b>of</b> <b>fruits,</b> and total fruit weight; a Pearson's correlation matrix was used to estimate the relationship between the variables. Path analysis was then performed considering total fruit weight as the main variable and the remaining variables as explanatory. Due to the severe multicollinearity, the variable 'number <b>of</b> <b>fruits</b> per bunch' was eliminated. Pearson's correlation coefficients were significant between explanatory and main variables. Mean fruit weight has a low cause-and-effect relationship with the total weight <b>of</b> <b>fruits</b> produced. A low cause-and-effect relationship was also observed between number <b>of</b> <b>fruits</b> and number <b>of</b> bunches. Cherry tomato productivity is directly related to the number <b>of</b> <b>fruits</b> per plant...|$|R
