Besides a formal semantics <b>of</b> <b>plan</b> execution and a repre-sentation <b>of</b> <b>plans</b> as programs, we introduce the concept <b>of</b> <b>plan</b> invariants. Plan invariants {{are similar to}} loop invariants in imperative programs in {{that they have to}} be true during the whole plan execution cycle. Once a plan invariant fails the plan execution is stopped and other plans that are more appropriate in the current context are considered for execution instead. The use <b>of</b> <b>plan</b> invariants allows for an early detection <b>of</b> problems. <b>Plan</b> assumptions that are required for a plan to succeed are explicitly represented by plan invariants. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In many domains {{successful}} execution <b>of</b> <b>plans</b> requires careful {{monitoring and}} repair. Diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>plan</b> execution supports this process by identifying causes <b>of</b> <b>plan</b> failure. Most plans have to satisfy temporal constraints. An important and common occurring problem during plan execution are violations <b>of</b> temporal <b>plan</b> constraints. This paper addresses diagnosis of such temporal constraint violations by modeling the temporal aspects <b>of</b> a <b>plan</b> as a Simple Temporal Network (STN). We investigate the com-putational properties of standard diagnostic concepts {{but we also}} ar-gue that traditional notions of preferred diagnoses such as minimum diagnosis are not adequate. A new notion of a maximum confirmation diagnosis is introduced. ...|$|R
