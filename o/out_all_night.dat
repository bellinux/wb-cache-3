Tomoya's mother (Atsuko) died when Tomoya was young, leaving his father (Naoyuki) to raise him. After the accident, Tomoya's father turned to alcohol and gambling, and had frequent fights with his son. One day, Naoyuki, while arguing with his son, slammed Tomoya against the window, dislocating Tomoya's shoulder. This injury prevents Tomoya from playing on the basketball team, and causes him {{to distance himself from}} others. Ever since then, his father has treated Tomoya nicely, but distantly, as if Tomoya and he were strangers rather than a family. This hurts Tomoya more than his previous relationship with his father, and the awkwardness of returning home leads Tomoya constantly to stay <b>out</b> <b>all</b> <b>night.</b> Thus his delinquent life begins. Tomoya's good friend Youhei Sunohara, who was thrown out of the soccer club over a dispute with his seniors, is also a delinquent and often hangs out in his dorm room with Tomoya doing nothing much.|$|E

500|$|Set in 2004, {{the film}} {{revolves}} around three young anti-capitalist activists in Berlin's city centre: Jule (Julia Jentsch), her boyfriend Peter (Stipe Erceg) {{and his best}} friend Jan (Daniel Brühl). Jule is a waitress struggling to pay off a €100,000 debt she incurred {{a year ago when}} she crashed into a Mercedes-Benz S-Class belonging to a wealthy businessman named Hardenberg (Burghart Klaußner). After her eviction for non-payment of rent she moves in with Peter and Jan, who are often <b>out</b> <b>all</b> <b>night.</b> While Peter is in Barcelona, Jan tells Jule that he and Peter spend their nights [...] "educating" [...] upper-class people by breaking into their houses, moving furniture around and leaving notes saying [...] "die fetten Jahre sind vorbei" [...] ("the days of plenty are over") or [...] "Sie haben zu viel Geld" [...] ("you have too much money").|$|E
500|$|Hooker's vocal {{alternates}} between sung {{and spoken}} sections. [...] Commenting on Hooker's vocal sections, music historian Ted Gioia notes, [...] "The song has almost no melody. [...] Even less harmony. [...] In fact, {{it is hard}} to call it a song. [...] It's more like a bit of jive steam of consciousness in 4/4 time." [...] Some of the lyrics are borrowed from earlier songs that date {{back to the beginning of}} the blues. [...] The opening line [...] "My mama she didn't allow me to stay <b>out</b> <b>all</b> <b>night</b> long" [...] has origins in [...] "Mama Don't Allow", an old dance song. [...] Several songs were recorded in the 1920s with similar titles. [...] "Boogie No. 3" [...] by boogie-woogie pianist Cow Cow Davenport has sung and spoken sections and includes the lines, [...] "I don't care what Grandma don't allow, play my music anyhow, Grandma's don't 'llow no music playin' in here". Hooker's first and second takes of the song include similar verses and the narrative about Henry's Swing Club, but do not include the crucial mid-song hook [...] "Boogie, chillen'!" [...] before the guitar break, which gives the song its lyrical identity.|$|E
500|$|On {{leaving the}} École Niedermeyer, Fauré was {{appointed}} organist at the Church of Saint-Sauveur, at Rennes in Brittany. He {{took up the}} post in January 1866. During his four years at Rennes he supplemented his income by taking private pupils, giving [...] "countless piano lessons". At Saint-Saëns's regular prompting he continued to compose, but none of his works from this period survive. He was bored at Rennes and had an uneasy relationship with the parish priest, who correctly doubted Fauré's religious conviction. Fauré was regularly seen stealing out during the sermon for a cigarette, and in early 1870, when he turned up to play at Mass one Sunday still in his evening clothes, having been <b>out</b> <b>all</b> <b>night</b> at a ball, {{he was asked to}} resign. Almost immediately, with the discreet aid of Saint-Saëns, he secured the post of assistant organist at the church of Notre-Dame de Clignancourt, in the north of Paris. He remained there for only a few months. On the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 he volunteered for military service. He took part in the action to raise the Siege of Paris, and saw action at Le Bourget, Champigny and Créteil. He was awarded a Croix de Guerre.|$|E

500|$|... "Don't Wanna Go Home" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Bill Lamb from About.com awarded [...] "Don't Wanna Go Home" [...] {{a rating of}} four stars out of five, praising the song's [...] "ingratiating party mood" [...] and Derulo's [...] "energetic vocal performance". He also {{went on to say}} that [...] "Jason Derulo should have no problem taking back his place on pop radio playlists and pulling the Beluga Heights sound back into the spotlight." [...] Scott Shelter from PopCrush wrote that, [...] "Despite the track's lack of originality, the beat is irresistible, and its lyrics about staying <b>out</b> <b>all</b> <b>night</b> are likely to resonate with summer partiers," [...] and concluded by writing that it is [...] "a song that succeeds in spite of its shortcomings." [...] A writer for Beatweek magazine praised Derulo for sampling [...] "Day-O" [...] into the song's chorus, writing that [...] "'Don't Wanna Go Home' is yet the latest evidence that Derulo can create a song in any genre, using any kind of samples, and turn it into a hit." [...] Robbie Daw from Idolator wrote that, [...] "Compared to his last few mediocre offerings, this single actually seems to have some fire" [...] courtesy of the samples in the song. However, Daw concluded by writing that [...] "if Derulo wants to achieve any kind of credibility in the pop world, he'd better establish his own sound fast." [...] Meena Rupani from DesiHits felt that Derulo [...] "should think twice before he takes his lyrics from others." [...] Shahryar Rizvi from Dallas Observer called Derulo a [...] "lousy sampler", writing that [...] "all this song boasts is Derulo throwing airballs". At the 2011 Teen Choice Awards, [...] "Don't Wanna Go Home" [...] was nominated for 'Choice R/Hip Hop Track' accolade.|$|E
500|$|In 1884, Edison manager Charles Batchelor, who {{had been}} {{overseeing}} the Paris installation, was {{brought back to the}} US to manage [...] the Edison Machine Works, a manufacturing division situated in New York City, and asked that Tesla be brought to the US as well. In June 1884, Tesla emigrated to the United States. He began working almost immediately at the Machine Works on Manhattan's Lower East Side, an overcrowded shop with a workforce of several hundred machinists, laborers, managing staff, and 20 [...] "field engineers" [...] struggling with the task of building the large electric utility in that city. As in Paris, Tesla was working on troubleshooting installations and improving generators. Historian W. Bernard Carlson notes Tesla may have met company founder, Thomas Alva Edison, only a couple of times. One of those times was noted in Tesla's autobiography where, after staying up all night repairing the damaged dynamos on the ocean liner SS Oregon, he ran into Batchelor and Edison who made a quip about their [...] "Parisian" [...] being <b>out</b> <b>all</b> <b>night.</b> After Tesla told them he had been up all night fixing the Oregon Edison commented to Batchelor that [...] "this is a damned good man." [...] One of the projects given to Tesla was to develop an arc lamp–based street lighting system. Arc lighting was the most popular type of street lighting but it required high voltages and was incompatible with the Edison low voltage incandescent system, causing the company to lose contracts in cities that wanted street lighting as well. Tesla's designs were never put into production, possibly because of technical improvements in incandescent street lighting or because of an installation deal that Edison cut with an arc lighting company.|$|E
