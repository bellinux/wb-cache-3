5|$|Messages, many in {{commonly}} used ciphers and encryption systems, {{have been found}} hidden in the video and its sound spectrogram, as well as images of tortured and mutilated people. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>messages</b> have been decoded by participants in an ongoing Reddit thread, and the images sourced to notable murder investigations such as the Boston Strangler. They have been interpreted as implying a threat of bioterrorism against the United States, although {{it has also been}} speculated that the video is in reality a prank, a viral marketing stunt for an upcoming film or video game, or a student film.|$|E
5|$|Convinced {{they would}} be killed if the Malagasy {{discovered}} the truth while still on board ship, the crew sealed their messages in bottles and dropped them into the onshore current. The VOC authorities in Cape Town had sent their chief ship's carpenter, Philip van den Berg, with two other ship's carpenters, two pilots, a quartermaster and 20 sailors overland. Carpenters were needed since neither of Meermin boats, now onshore, could be used: one {{was buried in the}} sand, and the other was in need of repair. The party from Cape Town had arrived by 6March, and, while Johannes Le Sueur was overseeing the carpenters' examination of Meermins boats, he was handed a bottle containing a message signed by Jan de Leeuw. A second bottle, containing a message signed by Olof Leij, was also found and handed to Le Sueur, and the fires were lit on 7March. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>messages</b> is preserved in the Cape Archives Repository.|$|E

50|$|To send a <b>message</b> using EPKE, <b>the</b> sender <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> {{first signs}} <b>the</b> <b>message</b> {{using their own}} private key, this ensures {{non-repudiation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>message.</b> <b>The</b> sender then encrypts their digitally signed <b>message</b> using <b>the</b> receiver's public key thus applying a digital envelope to <b>the</b> <b>message.</b> This step ensures confidentiality during <b>the</b> transmission <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>message.</b> <b>The</b> receiver <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> then uses their private key to decrypt <b>the</b> <b>message</b> thus removing <b>the</b> digital envelope and then uses the sender's public key to decrypt the sender's digital signature.

5|$|The {{only reason}} the Nazis put on {{prisoner}} broadcasts {{is to get}} people justifiably anxious about relatives reported missing at the front {{to listen to their}} propaganda. Although many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>messages</b> undoubtedly are true, they represent but a small fraction of our prisoners and we have no assurance that many of them are not faked from papers picked up on the battlefield. What concerns some of us is the consequences of listening to Nazi broadcasts unless you are a well-trained listener (and often, even if you are). Nazi arguments often sound plausible. A person may listen to them with all the skepticism in the world, knowing that every word is a lie. But if the content is sufficiently sensational (and it often is) the source may be forgotten in time, and out pops the Nazi lie, all unsuspecting.|$|E
5|$|The British {{blockade}} squadrons had intercepted {{a number}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>messages</b> sent from the islands during 1808, {{and a large}} expeditionary force was built up on Barbados with orders to invade and capture the French colonies as swiftly as possible. Their first target was Martinique, which was invaded and captured during February 1809. Outlying islands were captured {{over the next few}} months and a major French reinforcement squadron was trapped and then defeated near the Îles des Saintes in April: the French lost a ship of the line, and two more frigates were captured in June and July as they tried to return to France. With such heavy losses, the French took time preparing their next effort while the British were distracted by the Reconquista in Santo Domingo, a Spanish campaign to drives the French out of the island of Hispaniola that was eventually concluded in July 1809 with British naval assistance. By the autumn of 1809, the British commander, Vice-Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane, was again developing an expeditionary force, this time aimed at Guadeloupe. He had strengthened the blockade squadron off the island's principal port Basse-Terre, and placed heavier forces at Martinique in case they were required. Individual ships were dispersed in the approaches to the French island, ready to intercept any approaching reinforcement. Other ships operated against ships already anchored off Guadeloupe: one squadron seized the corvette Nisus from Deshaies on 12 December.|$|E

50|$|To send a <b>message</b> using PKE, <b>the</b> sender <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> uses <b>the</b> {{public key}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{receiver}} to encrypt <b>the</b> contents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>message.</b> <b>The</b> encrypted <b>message</b> is then transmitted electronically to {{the receiver and}} the receiver can then use their own matching private key to decrypt <b>the</b> <b>message.</b>|$|R
5000|$|For this reason, most digital {{signature}} algorithms only confirm <b>the</b> authenticity <b>of</b> a hashed digest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> to be [...] "signed". Verifying <b>the</b> authenticity <b>of</b> a hashed digest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> is considered proof that <b>the</b> <b>message</b> itself is authentic.|$|R
25|$|RFC 850 was {{the first}} formal {{specification}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>messages</b> exchanged by Usenet servers. It was superseded by RFC 1036 and subsequently by RFC 5536 and RFC 5537.|$|E
25|$|E-mail tax is a {{specific}} type of bit-tax, which would tax based on volume of email sent or received, quantified either by number of messages or data size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>messages.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Bhagavad Gita and the {{traditional}} writings of Buddhism (e.g., some of the Mangala Sutta) have been interpreted as including teachings whose intentions resemble some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>messages</b> of Beatitudes (e.g., humility and absence of ego), although their wording is not the same.|$|E

25|$|With {{the entry}} of the United States into World War I, Fabyan offered the {{services}} of his Department of Codes and Ciphers to the government. No Federal department existed {{for this kind of}} work (although both the Army and Navy had had embryonic departments at various times), and soon Riverbank became the unofficial cryptographic center for the US Government. During this period, the Friedmans broke a code used by German-funded Indian radicals in the US who planned to ship arms to India to gain independence from Britain. Analysing the format <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>messages,</b> Riverbank realized that the code was based on a dictionary of some sort, a cryptographic technique common at the time. The Friedmans soon managed to decrypt most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>messages,</b> but only long after the case had come to trial did the book itself come to light: a German-English dictionary published in 1880.|$|E
25|$|Because of the secretive nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>messages,</b> the {{cryptographic}} function {{employed by}} particular stations is not publicly known, except in one (or possibly two) cases. It {{is assumed that}} most stations use a one-time pad {{that would make the}} contents of these number groups indistinguishable from randomly generated numbers or digits. In one confirmed case, West Germany did use a one-time pad for numbers transmissions.|$|E
25|$|Islamic preachers and clerics in Australia {{have been}} {{covered in the}} Australian press on account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>messages</b> they have {{delivered}} publicly to the Muslim community or have otherwise shared with others in public settings. In some instances, various ideas and viewpoints espoused by these preachers have been subject of public or internal debate. Statements viewed as misogynistic and radically paternalistic have come under criticism.|$|E
30|$|The payload AUTH is <b>the</b> digest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>message.</b> This digest is {{encrypted}} using <b>the</b> {{private key}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> core node KCN. The payload AUTH and the signature ensure both integrity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> and authentication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> core node.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> journal <b>message</b> contains, at a minimum, the {{following}} information: a copy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> actual <b>message,</b> any related metadata such as time, date, and individuals {{involved in the}} communication. More information may be included, such as a physical location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> originator/recipient(s), a computer identifier <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> originator/recipient(s), or a class/category <b>of</b> <b>message.</b> <b>The</b> journal <b>message</b> should maintain <b>the</b> same transport format as <b>the</b> actual <b>message</b> so that existing communication infrastructure can be utilized. For example, an e-mail journaling message will, itself, be an e-mail <b>message</b> containing <b>the</b> journaling information as either attachments or in <b>the</b> body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> journaling <b>message</b> and {{may be in the}} MIME format.|$|R
5000|$|Bitmessage {{replicates}} all <b>the</b> <b>messages</b> {{inside its}} own anonymous P2P network, therefore mixing all <b>the</b> encrypted <b>messages</b> <b>of</b> a given user with all <b>the</b> encrypted <b>messages</b> <b>of</b> all other users <b>of</b> <b>the</b> network, thus {{making it difficult}} to track which particular computer is <b>the</b> actual originator <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> and which computer is <b>the</b> recipient <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>message.</b>|$|R
25|$|A second {{method of}} {{prevention}} is by using cryptography. Rolling codes and challenge-response authentication (CRA) are commonly used to foil monitor-repetition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>messages</b> between the tag and reader; as any messages that have been recorded {{would prove to be}} unsuccessful on repeat transmission. Rolling codes rely upon the tag's id being changed after each interrogation, while CRA uses software to ask for a cryptographically coded response from the tag. The protocols used during CRA can be symmetric, or may use public key cryptography.|$|E
25|$|The rising tone {{of panic}} in these {{messages}} convinced Broome {{and every other}} recipient that Tirpitz was approaching. Since the first <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>messages</b> was not directly addressed to Broome, he was not immediately aware that the cruisers were withdrawing. In fact, although {{they should have been}} {{out of sight of the}} convoy, because of navigational errors they were clearly visible as they worked up to full speed. Convinced that the cruisers were about to engage enemy ships, Broome collected the miscellany of destroyers in EG1 and attached them to the cruisers, while the convoy scattered.|$|E

30|$|CMC_Receive (Algorithm 3) is invoked when {{a message}} MSG is received. <b>The</b> fields <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> are {{assigned}} to local variables (line 2) and <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> is checked (line 3).
