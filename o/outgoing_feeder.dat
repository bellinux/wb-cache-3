40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{evaluate}} and update load curves for Fortum Distribution AB. Theload curve method is a tool used to forecast the strain of an electric grid. The method is based oncustomer annual energy consumption, outdoors temperature as well as customer category.

Present consumption patterns have changed since the original load curves wereproduced, which leads to a need to update the load curves. The work began with an update of present load curves according to recommendation taken fromanother earlier thesis. Thereafter a forecast model was produced in Excel to calculate the strainfor one customer, using the new load curves.

In urban areas, ring feeding arrangements {{are likely to be}} used which provides an alternative feeding arrangement for load. Colombo City uses an open loop feeding arrangement with a normally open point in the ring arrangement. It has an underground 11 kV network where panel substations in a ring (partly meshed) manner are connected around the primary substation. <b>Outgoing</b> <b>feeders</b> from these panel substations are again connected in a ring manner through Ring Main Units. By providing correct directional protection coordination these panel substations can be operated in a closed loop ring arrangement to improve reliability. It will also reduce distribution line losses and improve the system voltage profile. In my dissertation, area fed by Primary Substation F was taken into consideration for analysis. Different time zones were recognized based on load changes for week days and weekends. The possible ring arrangements were identified and load flow analysis was carried out using SynerGEE for radial and closed loop ring arrangement to detail the power loss reduction, voltage improvement, excessive active power and reactive power absorbed by loads. Reliability improvement was derived for SAIFI and SAIDI, using the rate of failure of cables based on the cable failure details of Colombo City. Voltage analysis and cost analysis were also carried out using SynerGEE. Directional protection coordination was derived for two feeders operating in closed loop, two substations operating in closed loop and three substations operating in closed loop to cover the identified paralleling patterns in selected zones. Based on fault levels and the cable impedance data protection settings were calculated for actual field conditions for each pattern. Each pattern was simulated in Matlab to monitor the voltage and current variations for cable faults. In conclusion, if the conditions prevail, the panel arrangement existing in Colombo City provides an easy approach to operate the system in a closed loop ring arrangement by replacing existing numerical relays with directional numerical relays, which improves the reliability, reduces the distribution losses and provides voltage improvements...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2015 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from June 24, 2015 - June 24, 2017 Substations are a crucial element at the transmission and distribution level of electric power systems. The primary substation equipment (power transformers and high voltage switching equipment) is used to transfer and transform electric energy by stepping up or down the voltage in transmission substations. Secondary equipment (such as IEDs, Intelligent Electronic Devices) is used to control, protect and monitor primary equipment {{and the rest of}} the substation while relying on a variety of communication protocols. The IEC 61850 standard is a viable candidate for current Substation Automation Systems (SAS) as well as for future Smart Grid (SG) substations. SG is the next generation power grid, which aims to improve reliability and efficiency, reduce the cost of electric energy, and minimize environmental impacts. SG will be relying on effective and reliable communication, and the IEC 61850 standard shows the potential for providing such a communications framework. Currently, the delay performance evaluation of this standard has been carried out at the distribution level. At the transmission level, where data rates are high and there is a low latency requirement, this standard has yet to show its performance. In future Smart Grids, transmission substations will be part of a self-healing network that identifies the faults/blackouts and automatically connects/disconnects the feeders and re-routes power to ensure security of the grid. According to IEC 61850, the communication requirements for transmission substations will be more time-critical. In this work, the IEC 61850 's delay performance is evaluated at a transmission substation between different bays in the case of one <b>outgoing</b> <b>feeder’s</b> failure. OPNET software is used as a simulation tool. In OPNET, devices such as Analog Merging Units (MUs) and IEDs were implemented according to the IEC 61850 standard.

40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree Master of Technology: Electrical Engineering in the Faculty of Engineering at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology Supervisor: Prof. R. Tzoneva Co-supervisor: Prof. P. Petev 2013 Busbars {{are the most important}} components in the distribution networks. Faults on the busbar are uncommon, however an occurrence of a busbar fault can lead to a major loss of power. Busbars are the areas in a substation where the levels of current are high and therefore the protective relay application is very critical. In order for the protection scheme to be successful it is important to carry out the following specifications: Selectivity, Stability, Sensitivity, and Speed. To meet all of the above requirements protection must be reliable, meaning that the protection scheme must trip when called up to do so (dependability) and it must not trip when it’s not supposed to (security). The thesis focuses on the reverse blocking busbar protection scheme with aim to improve the speed of its operation {{and at the same time}} to increase operational reliability, flexibility and stability of the protection during external and internal faults by implementation of the extended functionality provided by the IEC 61850 standard-based protective IEDs. The practical implementation of the scheme by the use of IEC 61850 standard communication protocol is investigated. The research analyzes in detail the reverse blocking busbar protection scheme that is used at the moment in the power systems and it develops an improved IEC 61850 based reverse blocking busbar protection scheme for a distribution network. The proposed scheme is designed for a radial type of a distribution network and is modeled and simulated in the DigSILENT software environment for various faults on the busbar and its <b>outgoing</b> <b>feeders.</b> The results from the simulations are used further for implementation of the designed protection scheme. A laboratory test bench is build using three compliant with the IEC 61850 standard ABB IEDs 670 series, CMC 356 Omicron test injection device, PC, MOXA switch, and a DC power supplier. Two ways of the reverse blocking signals between the IEDs implementation are considered: hard wired and Ethernet communication by using IEC 61850 standard GOOSE messages. Comparative experimental study of the operational trip response speed of the two implementation shows that the performance of the protection scheme for the case of Ethernet communication is better The thesis findings and deliverables will be used for postgraduate studies of other students, research, short courses, and solution of industrial problems.

40|$|The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has the {{responsibility}} of distributing electricity to the consumers in Sri Lanka except few areas which belong to the Lanka Electric Company (LECO). When considering about the distribution network, distribution transformers play the major role. Protection of transformers is therefore very much important. Transformer failure rate and the distribution network reliability are major concerns of the CEB. Distribution transformer failure rate is high in theCEB network and also the fuse usage is unacceptably high. Present CEB fuse selection practice and practical situation at the field have been analyzed to find out better solution for above problems. Theory behind distribution transformer fuse selection has been discussed in detail. K type expulsion fuses are the recommended primary side fuses by the CEB. The study has proposed several changes to the existing fuse selection practice recommended by the CEB. The present distribution transformer protection scheme do not provide over load protection. It has been identified that nearly 13 % transformers had failed annually due to over load within the Southern Province. The study revealed that lower capacity of transformers such as 100 kVA and 160 kVA have the higher probability of getting overloaded. Furthermore, 15 % of distribution transformers installed in the Southern Province {{have at least one}} phase overloaded. A Primary side K type fuse does not provide overload protection to the distribution transformer. Hence, secondary side fuse should provide the over load protection but above findings tell that the expected task cannot be achieved by the present system. The study has proposed three options to solve this problem. Introduction of a primary fuse which is having special Time Current Characteristic (TCC) curve is the first option. The fuse type is called “SloFast” and it has a duel TCC curve. The SloFast fuse TCC curve behaves very much parallel to the transformer damage curve at some low level of current unlike K type fuse TCC curve, which intersects transformer damage curve at some low level of current. The second option is adding a main secondary fuse in between the transformer secondary terminal and the feeder fusses. So that the feeder fuse does the overload protection of the feeder conductor and the main secondary fuse does the overload protection of distribution transformer. The third option is limitation of the number of <b>outgoing</b> <b>feeders</b> from a transformer. This is very important for the distribution transformers having low capacities such as 100 kVA and 160 kVA, because the probability of getting overloaded is high with the present feeder arrangement. It is recommended the maximum number of feeders for each distribution transformer capacit...|$|R

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2014 Günümüzde elektrik enerjisinin kullanımı oldukça yaygın bir hale gelmiş olup, hem günlük hayatta hem de iş hayatında bir zorunluluk haline gelmiştir. Oluşan kısa süreli elektrik kesintileri, hayatımızı durma noktasına getirmektedir. Ekonomik büyüme, bilimsel-teknolojik gelişme ve nüfus yoğunluğundaki artış elektrik enerji talebini her geçen gün arttırmaktadır. Bu nedenle üretim tesislerinden iletim, dağıtım şebekeleri ve son tüketiciye kadar elektrik enerjisinin sağlanmasında görev alan tüm birimler bu talebe hazırlıklı olmalıdır. Bu hazırlık, gelecek dönemlerin önceden talep tahminin yapıldığı planlama çalışması sonucunda gerçekleştirilebilir. Elektrik enerjisinin üretiminden tüketicilere kadar ulaşmasında görev alan tüm şebekeler incelendiğinde en karmaşık yapıya sahip şebekenin dağıtım şebekeleri olduğu açık bir gerçektir. Dolayısıyla dağıtım şebekelerinin planlanmasında farklı kriterlerin göz önünde bulundurulması gerekmektedir. Karmaşık şebeke yapısının doğal sonucu olarak belirlenen kriterlerin karşılandığı birden çok çözüm seçeneği ortaya çıkabilmektedir. Bu nedenle, yapılan planlama çalışmalarının belirlenen kriterleri karşılamakla birlikte, kriterleri karşılayabilen olası alternatif çözümlerden en uygun olanının seçimini de içermesi gerekmektedir. Farklı değerlendirme kriterlerinin bulunduğu durumlarda karar verme, sadece dağıtım yatırımları için değil tüm kararlar için oldukça zordur. Bu zorluğun aşılması amacıyla çok kriterli karar verme yöntemleri geliştirilmiştir. Çok kriterli karar verme yöntemlerinin amacı; birden fazla kriterin olduğu durumlarda karar verme aşamasındaki belirsizlikleri ortadan kaldırmak ve karar verme sürecini belirli yapıya sokarak formülize etmek ve dökümantasyona hazırlamaktır. Yapılan bu çalışmada, ele alınan örnek bir dağıtım şebekesi için geleceğe ait tahmini yük artışı belirlenmiştir. Hem mevcut hem de gelecek dönem yük talebi dikkate alınarak zayıf nokta analizleri yapılmış ve problemli noktalar tespit edilmiştir. Bu problemlerin giderilmesi için; mevcut şebekenin güçlendirilmesi, gerilim dönüşümü ve dağınık üretim birimlerinin bağlanması şeklinde üç farklı alternatif çözüm sunulmuştur. Alternatiflerin değerlendirilmesi için genel anlamda ekonomik, teknik ve çevresel etkiler bazında sekiz farklı hedef ve kriterler belirlenmiştir. Alternatiflerin değerlendirilmesinde çok kriterli karar verme yöntemlerinden TOPSIS (For the {{technique}} for order preference by similarity to ideal solution) yöntemi kullanılmıştır. Her bir kriterin önemi, farklı ağırlık katsayıları verilerek belirlenmiştir. Ağırlık katsayıları değerlendirilerek belirtilen çözümler karşılaştırılmış ve uygun çözüm/çözümler belirlenmiştir. Her üç duruma ait karşılaştırma sonuçlarından çok kriterli karar vermede ağırlık katsayılarının önemi görülmüştür. Bu nedenle yatırımlara karar vericilerin hedeflerin, kriterlerin belirlenmesine ve ağırlıklandırılmasına ne kadar önem vermeleri açıkça ortaya çıkmaktadır. Nowadays, {{the usage of}} electrical energy has become a quite common. It has become a necessity in both daily life and business life. The short term power interruptions, bring the human life to a standstill. The demand to the electrical energy has increased day by day regarding to economic growth, scientific-technologic improvement and population growth. For this reason, all units which take a role from generation units to transmission, distribution system and also to the last consumer should be ready and well prepared for the increased demand. When the systems which are the parts from generation to the end customer are examined, {{there is no doubt}} that the distribution systems are the most complex one and they are in touch with the end customer. Therefore, so many criterias are needed to be taken into account in distribution system planning. In the past distribution planning studies, the planners were just taking into accounts the technical criterias like maximum voltage drop, overloading issues, technical losses etc. However, distribution utilities have realised that criterias just only for the technical issues is not enough in the competitive energy market. If the distribution utilites would like to survive in this market, they need to take into account the economical criterias besides the technical criterias. Otherwise, they can not withstand. Recent researches show that the economics of the distribution systems can be divided in three categories as capital cost, operation-maintenance cost and cost of losses. Some of these criterias is directly related to the technical issues, but some of them is related to financial problems in the utility. And also, some researches are done for combining these two things like selection of the optimal conductor for the system. Furthermore, technical and economical criterias are not enough to be sure about the investments. Some new criterias are involved to this process regarding to the changes in regulations, developments of economonics, technology. These criterias can be the supply quality, average interruption duration, average interruption frequency, customer satisfaction, environmental impacts (Green gas effect, CO 2, NOx emission etc.), visual esthetics, safety etc. As a result, the number of criteria are increasing with the development of the life. There can be so many alternative solutions as a natural result of the complex distribution systems. Implementing the first solution into the distribution system can cause a mistake. Thus, the distribution system planning study needs to include selection of the best alternative solution from alternative solutions which provides the defined criterias and goals. Deciding in a case with too many evaluation criterias and goals is very difficult for the decision makers in distribution utilities. However, this problem is not only for the distribution utilities. Hence, multiple criteria decision methods are improved to handle this problem. Recent researches show that evaluation of the real estate value,financial activities of the businesses and banks are analyzed with multiple criteria decision methods. The main aim of multi criteria decision methods is eliminating the uncertainties in decision making process with multiple criteria, creating a structure to be formulized and documentated. There are too many multi criteria decision methods regarding to the uncertainty and alternative number constraints. One of the multi criteria decision method TOPSIS (For {{the technique}} for order preference by similarity to ideal solution) can be used when no uncertainty appears in the problem variables and the comparability among the alternatives is not limited. In this study, multi criteria decision method is used for selection of the best alternative in distribution planning. A sample distribution system is modeled as geographically in PSS®Sincal v 9. 0 which is a network analysis software. The geographical network model let users see the routes of feeders, connections between the feeders and problematic areas better than schematic model. This sample distribution system is supplied from 31, 5 / 15, 8 kV MV/MV substation via 10 (12, 5) MVA power transformer. There are 5 outgoings from 15, 8 kV busbar, 142 distribution transformers (15, 8 / 0, 4 kV) and 141 km medium voltage lines (overhead lines and cables) in the sample distribution system. Existing active power demand of the system is 10, 11 MW. Load growth factor is defined as 5, 8 % for the sample distribution system for future power demand. The future active power demand of the systems is 13, 392 MW. The weak point analyzes are done for both existing and future term load conditions, and the problems in the system are detected for each term. The main reason of analyzing future term is understanding the future requirements and be ready for future with the new investments. In weak point analyzes, Newton-Raphson load flow method is used. As a result of weak point analyzes, the technical results and especially the voltage drop problems are shown with colour filter regarding to the limits in the graphics. For solving these problems, three different alternative solutions are proposed. First solution alternative is keeping the operating voltage as it is (15, 8 kV) and reinforcing of the existing system. In this solution alternative, the mainlines are reinforced, the overloaded distribution transformers are replaced with suitable higher capacity and adding a new power transformer 10 (12, 5) MVA to the MV/MV substation. Second alternative solution proposes a voltage conversion of the whole system. The operation voltage of the system is converted 15, 8 kV to 31, 5 kV. All <b>feeder</b> <b>outgoings</b> are disconnected from 15, 8 kV busbar and reconnected to the 31, 5 kV busbar. This MV/MV substation is converted as a MV distribution substation. According to the 31, 5 kV operating voltage, all the distribution transformers are replaced with the new ones. Third solution alternative proposes to add a new distributed generation units by using the hydro potentials in the area of the distribution system. These units are connected to the end of feeders where the voltage drop problems are seen. To evaluate the solution alternatives for selecting the best one, the goals and criterias are defined and can be classified as economical, technical and environmental impacts like in recent studies. The cost of capital, operating, maintenance cost and cost of losses are the parts of economical criterias. Maximum voltage drop, loss ratio in medium voltage level, system constraints (maximum power capability), supply quality (power can be supplied in an interruption case) are the technical criterias. The only criteria for environmental impact is CO 2 emission because of the fossil fuel of the generation units. In the evaluation part, TOPSIS (For the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution) method which is the common method in multi criteria decision methods is used. The criterias are weighted with different coefficients according to the importance in evaluation process. Regarding to the weighted coefficients in the first evaluation case, second solution alternative is selected as the best solution. The reason of the selection, second alternative takes the first position in the criterias which have 60 % weight, and in rest of the criterias it takes the second position with a tiny differences from the first position. These reasons make the second alternative as the best. To emphasize the importance of weighted coefficients for the criterias, the evaluation studies are done with two other weighted coefficient cases. In the second evaluation case of the coefficients, the first alternative selected as the best alternative. The reason of this selection is that capital cost criteria has 40 % weight where the first alternative is the best solution. And supply quality criteria which has 25 % weight where the first alternative has no solution and shares second position with its biggest competitive second alternative solution. In other criterias second alternative solution has advance rather than first, but this advantage is not enough to be selected the second solution as best one. In the third evaluation case of the coefficients, the third alternative solution selected as the best alternative. The reason of this selection depends on the 40 % weight in the supply quality. In this criteria, just only the third alternative provides a solution. The other two alternatives can not provide any solution, and this makes the third alternative solution as the positive ideal solution in evaluation process. Although, the third alternative has not taken the first position in any other criterias, it takes the whole points from supply quality criteria and win the competition against to the other alternatives. In conclusion, all three alternative solutions are compared with each other with taking into account the weighted coefficients. As a result of this comparison, the crucial contribution of the weighted coefficients in multi criteria decision making is shown up. Accordingly, it is absolutely clear that the decision makers in distribution utilites have to put emphasis on defining the goals, criterias and weighted coefficients to select the best alternative. Therefore, the distribution utilities should create their own decision team which includes employees from different responsibilities and experiences. However, these decision teams may not be fair. This situation can cause an unfair competition between the distribution companies. To prevent this problem, energy market regulatory authorities have to define the limits for the criterias, audit each distribution companies’ decision teams and check the decisions to balance the rights with the other distribution companies. Also, the investments which are the results of this decision process can be monitored according to the criterias. These results can be used as a feedback for the importance of the weighted coefficients. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
