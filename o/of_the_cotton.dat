2500|$|In the United States, Southern cotton {{provided}} {{capital for}} <b>the</b> continuing development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North. <b>The</b> <b>cotton</b> was largely produced through <b>the</b> labor <b>of</b> enslaved African Americans. It enriched both the Southern landowners and the Northern merchants. Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Southern <b>cotton</b> was trans-shipped through northern ports. In this era the slogan [...] "Cotton is king" [...] characterized <b>the</b> attitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> South toward this monocrop.|$|R
5|$|In the 18th century, the Zaydani clan {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Zahir al-Umar ruled large parts of Palestine autonomously until the Ottomans were able to defeat them in their Galilee strongholds in 1775-76. Zahir had turned the port city of Acre into a major regional power, partly fueled by his monopolization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cotton</b> and olive oil trade from Palestine to Europe. Acre's regional dominance was further elevated under Zahir's successor Ahmad Pasha al-Jazzar at the expense of Damascus.|$|E
5|$|Railroad {{connections}} with the southwest and Texas were improved during the 1870s, with the formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cotton</b> Belt Railroad. In addition to connecting St. Louis with the West, the railroads began to demand {{connections with}} the east across the Mississippi. Between 1867 and 1874, work on the Eads Bridge over the Mississippi continued despite setbacks such as caisson disease. The bridge formally opened on July 4, 1874.|$|E
5|$|Virginia {{made some}} {{attempts}} {{to phase out}} slavery, and manumissions had increased {{in the first two}} decades after the war. Thomas Jefferson Randolph gained passage of an 1832 resolution for gradual abolition in the state, but by that time, increased demand from development in the Deep South created a large internal market for slavery. The invention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cotton</b> gin in the late-eighteenth century had enabled the profitable cultivation of short-staple cotton in the uplands, which was widely used.|$|E

5|$|A strong {{relationship}} existed between Zahir and the Shia Muslim peasants of Jabal Amil and their sheikhs. Zahir maintained {{law and order}} in Jabal Amil, while leaving its mostly Shia inhabitants to their own devices. The Shia also benefited economically from Zahir's monopoly <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cotton</b> industry and their sheikhs provided him men of great military skill to support his struggle against the Ottoman authorities. Zahir was a key backer of the Shia in their war with the Druze Jumblatt clan and the Shihab dynasty under Mulhim Shihab, and likewise, Shia forces were critical to the defense of Zahir's sheikhdom against expeditions by the Ottoman governor of Damascus in 1771 and 1772.|$|E
5|$|Extensive {{damage was}} {{reported}} throughout the state. About one-seventh <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cotton</b> crop {{was destroyed by}} Octave. Much of the rich topsoil crop was washed downstream into large reservoirs. Furthermore, agriculture damage totaled about $97.5 million. Damage to homes totaled $17 million while damages to business exceeded $6 million in damage. Public property damage reached $55.7 million. A father, mother, and two children were swept off their truck in Ash Fork. Two navy officers where killed on September 30 near Ostman when their jet crashed. On October 1, a man drowned in the Santa Cruz river. Another person drowned in a wash near Tucson when his truck stalled. In addition, a taxi driver and a passenger died when tried to cross a flooded river.|$|E
5|$|In 1832, David Sasson {{immigrated to}} Bombay and {{established}} himself as a magistrate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cotton</b> industry. He built the Magen David Synagogue in Kolkata in 1861; this was in addition to the older Magen Hasidim synagogue. His son, Abdulla Sassoon, transformed the weaving industry in Bombay. To cater to the increasing need of the Baghdadi Jews, Knesset Eliyahoo synagogue was constructed on a premium piece of land in the hub of Bombay's commercial area by Jacob Sassoon, grandson of David Sassoon, commemorating his father, Eliyahoo Sassoon. It was established in 1884.|$|E

5|$|In 893 Asser wrote a {{biography}} of Alfred, called the Life of King Alfred. The manuscript survived to modern times in only one copy, which was part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cotton</b> library. That copy was destroyed in a fire in 1731, but transcriptions {{that had been made}} earlier, together with material from Asser's work which was included by other early writers, have enabled the work to be reconstructed. The biography is the main source of information about Alfred's life and provides far more information about Alfred than is known about any other early English ruler. Asser assisted Alfred in his translation of Gregory the Great's Pastoral Care, and possibly with other works.|$|E
5|$|The 2013 AT Cotton Bowl Classic was a post-season American college {{football}} bowl game held on January 4, 2013 at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas in the United States.

It featured the Texas A Aggies from the Southeastern Conference (SEC) against the Big 12 Conference co-champion Oklahoma Sooners {{and was the}} final game of the 2012 NCAA Division I FBS football season for both teams. Both the Aggies and the Sooners accepted their invitations after finishing the regular season 10â€“2.|$|E
5|$|The decline <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cotton</b> {{industry}} in Mumbai fuelled an economical boom in Coimbatore in the 1920s and 1930s. The region {{played a significant}} role in the Indian independence movement with Mahatma Gandhi visiting the city thrice. Coimbatore was the base of operations for political figures such as S. P. Narasimhalu Naidu, R. K. Shanmukham Chetty, C.S. Rathinasabapathy and C. Subramaniam during the freedom movement. Post independence, Coimbatore has seen rapid growth due to industrialisation and in 1981, Coimbatore was constituted as a Municipal corporation. On February 14, 1998, the radical Islamist group Al Ummah bombed 11 places across the city killing 58 people and injuring more than 200.|$|E

5|$|The high European {{demand for}} the product enabled Zahir to grow wealthy and finance his {{autonomous}} sheikhdom. This control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cotton</b> market also allowed him to gain unofficial control over all of the Sidon Eyalet, outside the city of Sidon itself. With mixed success, Zahir attempted to have French merchant ships redirected from the ports of Tyre and Sidon to Haifa instead, in order {{to benefit from the}} customs fees he could exact. The city of Acre underwent an economic boom {{as a result of its}} position in the cotton trade with France, and became the fortified headquarters of Zahir's sheikhdom.|$|E
5|$|The {{manuscript}} {{was originally}} published in 1723 as Hemingi chartularium ecclesiÃ¦ Wigorniensis, in two volumes edited by Thomas Hearne. This {{was part of the}} Chronica Anglia series put out between 1709 and 1735, which included many chronicles and records in 20volumes. Hearne printed his edition from a transcription made for the antiquary Richard Graves. This transcript, known as MS Rawlinson B.445, is not a completely accurate transcription <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cotton</b> Tiberius manuscript, as some items were omitted, and marginalia were not always transcribed. There were also some additions of decorations.|$|E
5|$|Within a year, Laurel Grove failed. Fred was inexperienced {{and made}} poor bargains with local merchants. Before the war, {{plantations}} {{had been largely}} self-sufficient, but Fred paid high prices for goods shipped in from Savannah and Charleston. He took days off {{at a time to}} visit saloons in Jacksonville. An unanticipated infestation of cotton-worm larvae (Helicoverpa zea) destroyed much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cotton</b> crop. Only two bales were produced by Laurel Grove; Stowe realized the venture was a failure. Fred committed himself to a rehabilitation asylum in New York, and at some point in 1867, Stowe purchased the cottage and the attached grove in Mandarin.|$|E

5|$|As a result, {{the text}} of Asser's Life is known from a {{multitude}} of different sources. Various transcripts had been made <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cotton</b> manuscript and a facsimile of {{the first page of}} the manuscript had been made and published, giving more direct evidence for the hand of the scribe. In addition to these transcripts, the extracts mentioned above made by other early writers have been used to help assemble and assess the text. Because of the lack of the manuscript itself and because Parker's annotations had been copied by some transcribers as if {{they were part of the}} text, scholarly editions have had a difficult burden. There have been multiple editions of The Life published, both in Latin and in translation. The 1904 critical edition by W. H. Stevenson, Asser's Life of King Alfred, together with the Annals of Saint Neots erroneously ascribed to Asser, still provides the standard text. An important recent translation, with thorough notes on the scholarly problems and issues, is Alfred the Great: Asser's Life of King Alfred and Other Contemporary Sources by Simon Keynes and Michael Lapidge.|$|E
5|$|Despite being a {{major power}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cotton</b> {{industry}} {{in the first quarter}} of the 19th century, the Strutts' company began to lose out to competition from Lancashire mill towns. The problem of shifting markets affected the entire Derwent Valley; Lancashire was better situated than Derbyshire in relation to the raw materials and new markets. The mills run by the Strutt family also suffered from a lack of modernisation; although they were at the forefront of fireproofing technology at the start of the 19th century, as the machines the mills used got bigger and more powerful, the Strutts persevered with child labour where adults would have been more adept at using the machinery. The company declined and in the second half of the 19th century some of its mills were leased or sold off to other companies. Although the cotton {{industry in the}} Derwent Valley declined, many of the structures associated with the industrial processes associated with producing cotton and workers' housing has survived and there are 848 listed buildings in the World Heritage Site.|$|E
5|$|Further inland, the {{combination}} of strong winds and rains left heavy crop damage, destroying 3million bushels of corn and another million bushels of soybeans; losses to the corn crop were mitigated due to {{about half of the}} crop having been harvested before the storm's arrival. Heavy damage was also reported to the peanut crop as well as to various fruits and vegetables. In some locations, up to 15% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cotton</b> crop was lost, particularly in the northeastern portion of the state. In 45 counties in the eastern portion of the state, farmers affected by the hurricane were eligible for loans from the Farmers Home Administration, following federal approval from United States President Richard Nixon. Governor Robert W. Scott requested federal disaster aid for 24counties, which was denied. Damage in North Carolina was estimated at $10million (1971USD, $ USD), of which about $1million (1971USD, $ USD) was from coastal flooding. One death occurred in Washington when a vehicle accident was possibly caused by a wind gust; however, it was not conclusively linked to Ginger.|$|E

40|$|Cotton linters were hydrolyzed with {{different}} concentrations of HCl (2. 5 - 15 %) to prepare microcrystalline cellulose.
