Managerial ineffectiveness, bad organization <b>of</b> <b>production</b> <b>and</b> shortages of inputs and raw materials were among the factors that contributed to further deterioration of workers' morale. 640,000 people of productive age left the country between 1981 and 1988.|$|E

5|$|Hoodwinked! {{was among}} the {{earliest}} computer-animated films to be completely independently funded. Working apart from a major studio allowed the filmmakers greater creative control, but also restrained them economically. Due to the film's small budget, its animation was produced in the Philippines, with a less-realistic design inspired by stop motion films. The Weinstein Company did not sign on as the film's distributor until near the end <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> <b>and</b> while the company had many roles recast, it otherwise made few changes to the film.|$|E

In a fire accident in August 2011, seven people were killed and five were seriously injured. A similar fire accident and blast in a private unit in September 2012 killed 40 people and injured 38 others. The common reasons cited for the accidents are inadequate training of workers and supervisors involved in different stages <b>of</b> <b>production</b> <b>and</b> marketing of firecracker items. Other reasons are found to be overstocking of explosives, raw material and finished goods, and employment of workers in excess of the permitted strength.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1960s, {{sales of}} Hardy Boys books began to drop. The Stratemeyer Syndicate {{conducted}} a survey, which {{revealed that the}} decline in sales {{was due to the}} perceived high cost of the books and to competition from television. As a result, the Syndicate approved an hour-long pilot for a new Hardy Boys television show. The pilot, based on The Mystery of the Chinese Junk, was aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) on September 8, 1967 and starred Tim Matthieson (later Matheson) as Joe Hardy and Rick Gates as Frank. Both actors were twenty at the time <b>of</b> <b>production</b> <b>and</b> portrayed the Hardy Boys as young adults rather than children, as they had been in the Mickey Mouse Club serials. The show did poorly, however, and the series was abandoned.|$|E

5|$|Several {{methods for}} {{identifying}} synthetic diamonds can be performed, {{depending on the}} method <b>of</b> <b>production</b> <b>and</b> {{the color of the}} diamond.

Stones in the D-Z color range can be examined through the DiamondSure UV/visible spectrometer, a tool developed by De Beers. Similarly, natural diamonds usually have minor imperfections and flaws, such as inclusions of foreign material, that are not seen in synthetic diamonds.|$|E
5|$|Sonic Team {{developed}} {{the game in}} the United States, unlike their previous titles which had been developed in Japan. The concept for the game originated during the development of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 in 1992, but actual development did not begin until after the release of Sonic & Knuckles in late 1994. The programming of the game began in April 1995 and total development spanned a period of six months. The development team consisted of staff who worked on previous Sonic the Hedgehog titles: Yuji Naka (the former head of AM8) was selected to act as lead programmer and producer, while Naoto Ohshima and Takashi Iizuka undertook the roles of director and lead designer, respectively. According to Naka, the initial development team consisted of seven people at the start <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> <b>and</b> gradually grew to 20 people once more programmers started to arrive.|$|E
5|$|The Imperial Japanese Navy {{convened a}} {{commission}} to investigate the explosion {{the day after the}} incident with Vice Admiral Murakami Kakuichi as chairman. The commission first suspected arson, but no plausible suspect could be found and it reported that the cordite in her magazine might have spontaneously ignited due to decomposition. Kawachis magazines had been inspected in January–February 1918, however, and no problems were discovered, which made that possibility less likely. The commission made recommendations on tighter control <b>of</b> <b>production</b> <b>and</b> handling of cordite that were successfully adopted by the navy. The Japanese Navy considered salvaging Kawachi, but ultimately decided that it would be too expensive and would delay the construction of one battlecruiser by over a year. Stricken from the navy list on 21 September 1918, the wreck was later partially dismantled although most of the hull was abandoned in place to serve as an artificial reef.|$|E

Despite sharp losses since 1999, the motor vehicle production industry was able to recover in 2001, producing {{a net gain of}} 148,000 vehicles. General Motors produced the plurality of motor vehicles in Ohio, with 36.5% of the production of motor vehicles in Ohio, followed closely by Honda with 35.9%. Other major motor vehicle producers in Ohio include DaimlerChrysler (with 17.5% <b>of</b> <b>production)</b> <b>and</b> Ford (with 10.5% of production).

5|$|The {{inclusion}} of multimedia software {{as a special}} feature was a novelty when Chrysalis Records released the Billy Idol's Cyberpunk diskette. This was also widely adopted by the music industry years later. CD-ROMs were initially considered as a medium for Cyberpunks multimedia features, but were too expensive at the time <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> <b>and</b> so floppy disks were used instead. Peter Gabriel and Todd Rundgren had previously experimented with CD-ROMs, but {{it was hoped that}} if Idol's album had proved popular, it could have been reissued with CD-ROMs, catapulting the format into the music industry's mainstream. This never materialised due to the album's general failures. However, during the late '90s it became increasingly common for some limited edition digipaks to include CD-ROMs, evolving by the early 2000s into the {{inclusion of}} DVDs.|$|E
5|$|The {{organisation}} {{of society}} depends on means of production.

In other words, the social relationships people enter into as they acquire and use the means of production. Together, these compose the mode <b>of</b> <b>production</b> <b>and</b> Marx distinguished historical eras in terms of distinct modes of production. Marx differentiated between base and superstructure, with the base (or substructure) referring to the economic system and superstructure, to the cultural and political system. Marx regarded this mismatch between (economic) base and (social) superstructure as a major source of social disruption and conflict.|$|E
