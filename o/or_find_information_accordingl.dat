For example, assuming linearity, causal sufficiency, and nonGaussian errors (Shimizu et al. 2006), conditional independence tests can at best reliably determine the correct Markov equivalence class, while using other features of the sample density can be used to reliably determine a unique graph (Shimizu et al. 2006) <b>or</b> <b>find</b> <b>information</b> about latent variables.

The revolution continues as smart technologies like internet-capable wristwatches meet the market. The result is an abundance of information, available at any time with {{the click of a}} button or tap of a screen. When a question arises, the default reaction is to “Google it,” rather than attempt to recall an answer, solve the problem, <b>or</b> <b>find</b> <b>information</b> from any other source. While this is a valuable way of accessing information, students should be cautioned against accepting the information at face value, and encouraged to evaluate that information for accuracy, validity, bias, and so on (Weiler, 2004). At a time when critical thinking skills are more necessary than ever, these skills are not being explicitly developed. The convention of teaching large classes in the sciences usually leads to information being received passively, without much room for questioning or challenging the content. Science students are given content rather than the tools for seeking and evaluating scientific information themselves (Pithers 2 ̆ 6 Soden, 2000). Given the continuously evolving nature of scientific theory and the abundance of information available on the Internet, instructors must equip students with tools for finding and analyzing information; these tools can be applied to both classroom and life-long learning. This workshop provides instructors with strategies for active learning that promote development of critical thinking skills in students...|$|R

The types of agent available are Priests and Imams, princesses, diplomats, merchants, assassins and spies.Priests and Imams will steadily convert a province to their faction's religion, causing or reducing religious unrest, and can denounce dangerous heretics and witches. Princesses and diplomats are able to negotiate with other factions, and princesses can attempt to marry a rival family member to gain his allegiance. Merchants can be stationed on resources on the map to generate income and can attempt to eliminate rival merchants through a takeover.

Some of this information included URLs referring back to the original information source, whereas some information was from other individuals’ translation of domestic TV broadcasts and news articles. Similarly, some individuals and groups provided Japanese information by translating it into English on their blogs and websites.

The algorithm uses deletions to model the edit distance. For a dictionary containing n words of average length m, and given a maximum number of spelling errors k, FastSS uses a deletion dictionary of size O(nm k). At search time each query is mutated to generate a deletion neighborhood of size O(m k), which is compared to the indexed deletion dictionary. As a deletion neighborhood is smaller than a neighborhood using deletions, insertions and replacements, this contributes to a faster search.
