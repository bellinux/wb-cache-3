5|$|Although Kuala Lumpur is {{touted as}} one of the host cities for the Formula One World Championship, the open-wheel auto racing A1 Grand Prix and the Motorcycle Grand Prix, races are held at the Sepang International Circuit in Sepang in the {{neighbouring}} state of Selangor.

Despite cities around Asia suffering declining tourist arrivals, Kuala Lumpur tourist arrivals increased from 6,210,900 in 1997 to 10,221,600 in 2000, or 64.6% increase in tourist arrivals. In 2015, the Kuala Lumpur Street Circuit was constructed to host the Kuala Lumpur City Grand Prix motor racing event.|$|E
5|$|In Japan alone, 39confiscations {{including}} 363live {{animals were}} made between 1998 and 2006, with 2006 being the peak year. During {{the same time}} period, Thai, Indonesian, and Singaporean officials discovered 358lorises destined for Japan.

Twelve of those animals died. The deaths are not unusual, with a mortality rate of 76% for all species of confiscated slow lorises, many dying before they are transferred to zoos. The JWCS suspects that the high mortality rate among smuggled slow lorises causes traders to smuggle more slow lorises than are needed to supply the market.|$|E
