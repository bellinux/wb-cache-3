5|$|Strong {{partisan}} disagreement in Congress prevented {{adjustments to}} the Act's provisions.

5|$|In 1965, Robert McSpadden and Bill Dickinson, both music {{teachers}} in the Cincinnati Public Schools, founded the Cincinnati All-City Boy Choir, where they were struck by how the discipline they established for {{the boys in the}} choir carried over into their academic studies. They conceived the idea of a school where basic education was combined with intensive attention to children with artistic talents. With the support of Waldrip and Tom Murray, director for the west-central division of Cincinnati elementary schools, they pushed for $119,000 as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> levy referendum in May 1973; the measure was defeated. The school was approved with a drastically reduced budget of $27,000 plus $9,850 from the Board of Education’s general fund. They turned to private funding and won a $292,000 grant from J. Ralph Corbett, one of the city's foremost philanthropists for the arts, and $24,500 for a piano lab from the Baldwin Piano Company, which had manufactured pianos in Cincinnati since 1891.|$|E

5000|$|<b>A</b> {{graduate}} <b>tax</b> {{would allow}} education {{to be free}} {{at the point of}} delivery. Proponents claim that one benefit <b>of</b> <b>a</b> graduate <b>tax</b> is that it would prevent a market in higher education developing whereby students chose where and what to study based upon the ability to pay rather than academic ability. <b>A</b> graduate <b>tax</b> might raise more money for universities over the long term than capped tuition fees, depending on the level of the cap. David Greenaway, <b>a</b> critic <b>of</b> <b>a</b> graduate <b>tax</b> admits that <b>an</b> [...] "obvious attraction" [...] <b>of</b> such <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> is that it is levied only on graduates, the immediate beneficiaries of higher education.|$|R
5|$|Prime Minister Kevin Rudd {{suffered}} {{a decline in}} his personal ratings, and a perceived loss of support among his own MPs, following {{the failure of the}} Government's insulation program, controversy regarding the implementation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> on mining, the failure of the government to secure passage of its carbon trading scheme and some policy debate about immigration policy. Significant disaffection had arisen within the Labor Party as to the leadership style and direction of Rudd. On 23 June 2010 he announced that Gillard had asked him to hold a leadership ballot the following day to determine the leadership of the Labor Party, and hence the Prime Ministership of Australia.|$|E
5|$|Truman cooperated {{closely with}} the Republican leaders on foreign policy, though he fought them bitterly on {{domestic}} issues. The power of the labor unions was significantly curtailed by the Taft–Hartley Act, which was enacted over Truman's veto. Truman twice vetoed bills to lower income tax rates in 1947. Although the initial vetoes were sustained, Congress overrode his veto <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> cut bill in 1948. The parties did cooperate on some issues; Congress passed the Presidential Succession Act of 1947, making the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate rather than the Secretary of State next in line to the presidency after the Vice President.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey's {{half-brother}} Richard I nominated him {{archbishop of}} York after succeeding {{to the throne}} of England, probably {{to force him to}} become a priest and thus eliminate a potential rival for the throne. After some dispute Geoffrey was consecrated archbishop in 1191. He soon became embroiled in a conflict with William Longchamp, Richard's regent in England, after being detained at Dover on his return to England following his consecration in France. Geoffrey claimed sanctuary in the town, but he was seized by agents of Longchamp and briefly imprisoned in Dover Castle. Subsequently a council of magnates ordered Longchamp out of office, and Geoffrey was able to proceed to his archdiocese. The archbishop spent much of his archiepiscopate in various disputes with his half-brothers: first Richard and then John, who succeeded to the English throne in 1199. Geoffrey also quarrelled with his suffragan bishops, his cathedral chapter, and other clergy in his diocese. His last quarrel with John was in 1207, when the archbishop refused to allow the collection <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> and was driven into exile in France. He died there five years later.|$|E

5|$|In 1198 and 1199, William was Sheriff of Devon and Sheriff of Cornwall, {{along with}} another royal servant, {{and served as a}} royal justice. In 1200 he was {{recorded}} as a receiver of the carucage, a tax on land, in the Pipe roll; whether this meant that he was a local or a national collector of the tax is unclear. By 12 September 1204, William was Archdeacon of Taunton in the Diocese of Bath, and he witnessed the election of Jocelin of Wells as the new bishop of the diocese. He was jointly placed in charge of the mints of London and Canterbury in 1205, along with Reginald de Cornhill, with whom he also shared the collection of the tax of a fifteenth on merchants, a post the two had held since 1202. In May 1205 William, along with de Cornhill, was given custody of one of three dies for the mint at Chichester; in July the king gave William's custody to Simon of Wells, the Bishop of Chichester. William was one of the officials in charge of the collection <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> of a thirteenth in 1207.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to estimate the}} regressivity and distributional impact <b>of</b> <b>a</b> domestic fuel <b>tax</b> in Australia, in both cross-sectional and life-cycle contexts. The question <b>of</b> whether <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> policy may attempt {{to compensate for the}} regressivity <b>of</b> <b>a</b> domestic fuel <b>tax</b> by redistributing the tax revenue in the form of increased transfer payments to those on low incomes is also considered. The paper focuses on 'impact effects' and does not account for behavioral responses. However, special emphasis is placed on lifetime incidence. The results suggest that, compared with <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> on food which is the most regressive of all consumption taxes, the impact effects on income distribution <b>of</b> introducing <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> on domestic fuel are likely to be small. Furthermore, when transfer payments are adjusted to maintain revenue-neutrality, the regressivity is more than compesated. The results hold in both cross-sectional and life-cycle contexts.

25|$|The {{existence}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> {{can increase}} economic efficiency in some cases.

50|$|<b>A</b> {{steering}} <b>tax</b> (Often <b>an</b> Ecological incentive <b>tax)</b> is <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> {{which aims}} to change the behaviour of the tax payer, as defined by lawmakers, and not particularly to increase tax revenue.

The Pigovian <b>tax</b> is <b>a</b> special case <b>of</b> <b>a</b> steering <b>tax</b> to avoid negative Externality.

40|$|Graduate <b>tax</b> is <b>a</b> {{concept that}} was only {{recently}} introduced into the public discourse in South Africa. Little is known about {{how it will be}} implemented and who will be liable to pay such <b>a</b> <b>tax.</b> The purpose <b>of</b> this study is to examine the proposed introduction of graduate tax for South African tertiary education graduates and the public perception <b>of</b> such <b>a</b> <b>tax.</b> To achieve the objectives of the study, relevant literature was reviewed that explained the concept <b>of</b> <b>a</b> graduate <b>tax</b> and the possible advantages and disadvantages of its imposition. Data collected by means <b>of</b> <b>a</b> questionnaire was analysed, which revealed the public perception <b>of</b> <b>a</b> graduate <b>tax</b> as well as its possible consequences. The analysis of the data collected indicated that graduate tax is perceived as <b>an</b> additional <b>tax</b> to be paid by graduates from tertiary institutions, whereas the literature defined it as <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> paid by tertiary institution graduates who received their tertiary education at no cost. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} imposition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> graduate <b>tax</b> may deter some from pursuing a tertiary degree in order to avoid liability for such <b>tax.</b> The imposition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> graduate <b>tax</b> could also lead to <b>an</b> outflow <b>of</b> skills, as graduates would be likely to seek employment outside South Africa in order to avoid paying graduate tax. It is recommended in this study that more clarity should be given to the public as to what this proposed graduate tax would entail and who would be affected by it.
