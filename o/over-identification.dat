500|$|LARP is {{not well}} known in most {{countries}} and is sometimes confused with other role-playing, reenactment, costuming, or dramatic activities. While fan and gamer culture in general has become increasingly mainstream in developed countries, LARP has often not achieved {{the same degree of}} cultural acceptability. This may be due to intolerance of the resemblance to childhood games of pretend, a perceived risk of <b>over-identification</b> with the characters, and the absence of mass marketing. In US films such as the 2006 documentary Darkon, the 2007 documentary Monster Camp, and the 2008 comedy Role Models, fantasy LARP is depicted as somewhat ridiculous and escapist, but also treated affectionately as a [...] "constructive social outlet". In the Nordic countries, LARP has achieved a high level of public recognition and popularity. It is often shown in a positive light in mainstream media, with an emphasis on the dramatic and creative aspects. However, even in Norway, where LARP has greater recognition than in most other countries, it has still not achieved full recognition as a cultural activity by government bodies.|$|E

50|$|Generally, the {{techniques}} and methods used are guided by two principles: distanciation and <b>over-identification.</b>|$|E
50|$|Much of the {{research}} conducted on self-compassion so far has used the Self-Compassion Scale, created by Kristin Neff, which measures {{the degree to which}} individuals display self-kindness against self-judgment, common humanity versus isolation, and mindfulness versus <b>over-identification.</b>|$|E
50|$|When {{the number}} of moment {{conditions}} {{is greater than the}} dimension of the parameter vector θ, the model is said to be over-identified. <b>Over-identification</b> allows us to check whether the model's moment conditions match the data well or not.|$|E
50|$|The long {{version of}} the Self-compassion scale (SCS) {{consists}} of 26 items. This includes 6 subscales - self-kindness, self-judgement, common humanity, isolation, mindfulness, and <b>over-identification.</b> Neff recommends this scale for ages 14 and up with a minimum 8th grade reading level.|$|E
50|$|Subversive {{affirmation}} is {{an artistic}} performance that overemphasizes prevailing ideologies and thereby calls them into question. Simultaneously with affirmation, the affirmed concepts are revealed, and artists {{distance themselves from}} those concepts. Strategies of subversive affirmation include <b>over-identification,</b> over-affirmation, yes revolution and paradoxical intervention.|$|E
5000|$|Jung was {{concerned}} {{with the possibility of}} one's <b>over-identification</b> with their own persona, which would turn an individual into a stereotype born of social expectations and ambition, [...] "unchildlike and artificial". The child archetype becomes of use in this case, strengthening the individual's link to their past by helping them recall childhood experiences and emotions.|$|E

This performance elaborates on the basics of the cargo cult and shows the difficult implications of simulation and <b>over-identification</b> today." ...|$|E
50|$|Many New Times intellectuals were {{instrumental}} in reorganising the Labour Party. Hobsbawm was a close advisor to Neil Kinnock, as Martin Kettle later was to Tony Blair. Many of Blair's inner circle were former Communists of the Euro/NT school. While those intellectuals who still identify with the New Times school are often very critical of Blair's alleged <b>over-identification</b> with Thatcherite policy, there is an obvious genetic and historical link between the NT rightward shift and 'New Labour'.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, <b>over-identification</b> means to {{publicly}} express those aspects which {{are well known}} but still taboo, or consciously disregarded. An effective way of subversion may consist in expressing positively the hidden aspects of the communication in a convincing way, better if it {{is close to the}} system dominant logic. This is a call to the background parts of the message not always seen but felt. Another example of <b>over-identification</b> exists in the work of street artist Banksy. In October 2003 he entered the landscape room at the Tate Britain, removed a framed painting from his bag, and glued it to the wall. Beside the work, a rural scene with an image of police tape stenciled over it, the artist placed a card reading: [...] "Banksy 1975. Crimewatch UK Has Ruined The Countryside For All Of Us. 2003. Oil On Canvas.". As mentioned prior, this installation ensures that the “felt message” is also the “seen message”. It is a reaction to a culturally dominating institution, Crimewatch UK. It was accomplished in a guerrilla-esque, under-the-radar manner, and it also amplifies a consensus of sentiments towards such institutions.|$|E
5000|$|Žižek's psychoanalytic {{approach}} to subversive affirmation and <b>over-identification</b> {{is applied to}} the study of the work of Michael Moore, IRWIN, The Yes Men, Atelier Van Lieshout, and Christoph Schlingensief in a book edited by the Dutch collective BAVO in 2007. In Brave New Avant Garde, Marc James Léger develops Žižek's theory in relation to Lacan's concept of the Sinthome and the Discourse of the Analyst (Four discourses), arguing that Social practice (art) can in some cases be understood in its connection to the Avant-garde.|$|E
50|$|Psychologists in the United States and United Kingdom {{created a}} celebrity worship scale {{to rate the}} problems. In 2002, United States psychologists Lynn McCutcheon, Rense Lange, and James Houran {{introduced}} the Celebrity Attitude Scale, a 34 item scale administered to 262 persons living in central Florida. McCutcheon et al. suggested that celebrity worship comprised one dimension in which lower scores on the scale involved individualistic behavior, such as watching, listening to, reading and learning about celebrities, whilst the higher levels of worship are characterized by empathy, <b>over-identification,</b> and obsession with the celebrity.|$|E
5000|$|In Film and the Masquerade: Theorising the Female Spectator, Doane {{agreed with}} Laura Mulvey on cinema {{catering}} to male pleasures {{and the male}} gaze. She argues that women are {{too close to the}} object of the gaze; they struggle between feminine and masculine viewing positions, “invoking the metaphor of the transvestite.” As a result of having to adopt male viewpoints, women are more fluid in terms of sexuality and gender. Women must “masculinize” their spectatorship to avoid masochism (from <b>over-identification)</b> or narcissism (from becoming their own object of desire), and because of this, Doane claims [...] "womanliness is a mask which can be worn and removed".|$|E
50|$|Alternatively, one can nurture self-compassion {{instead of}} self-esteem. Self-compassion {{researcher}} Professor Kristin Neff describes self-compassion {{as a combination}} of nurturing self-kindness over self-judgment, a sense of humanity over isolation, and a state of mindfulness rather than <b>over-identification.</b> A person experiencing distress who exercises self-compassion would be gentle towards him or herself rather than be harsh and critical and would recognize {{that he or she}} is not alone- rather, all people suffer at some point or another. This approach, Professor Neff and colleagues have found, can be beneficial for romantic relationships. In their study, self-compassion, not self-esteem, was significantly linked with greater relationship satisfaction. In addition, the presence of self-compassion predicted more positive relationship behaviors and less negative behaviors.|$|E
50|$|Neff's scale proposes three {{interacting}} {{components of}} self-compassion, which are each {{composed of two}} opposite facets. The first dimension is self-kindness versus self-judgment. Self-kindness refers to one's ability to be kind and understanding of oneself, whereas self-judgement refers to being critical and harsh towards oneself. The second dimension is common humanity versus isolation. Common humanity refers to one's ability to recognize that {{they are part of}} a related group of others and that suffering is part of the human condition. The third dimension is mindfulness versus <b>over-identification.</b> Mindfulness refers to one's awareness and acceptance of painful experiences in a balanced and non-judgmental way. Neff describes these three dimensions interacting to enhance and engender one another.|$|E

50|$|As the novel's title indicates, sympathy is {{the driving}} force behind several characters' actions. The excesses of {{sympathetic}} thought lead to tragedy; it is implied that Harrington's suicide, for example, is spurred on by an <b>over-identification</b> with The Sorrows of Young Werther, a copy of which is found alongside his body. These excesses are contrasted with the rational thinking of characters like Worthy, who strives to uphold normative social and moral ideals. While the overly sympathetic characters do not survive the course of the novel, the rational characters do survive, suggesting that at the very least, a balance of sympathy and rational thinking (or the use of reason to overcome passion) are necessary for a productive, successful member of society.|$|E
5000|$|Death metal, ritual {{murder and}} teenage suicide are {{starting}} points for Banks Violette. His work is notable for combining references to excess from youth culture with minimalist form, often using glossy black and ghostly white materials. Citing examples where musical lyrics become instigating factors to real-life violence, Violette {{refers to an}} <b>over-identification</b> with fiction, where fantasy and reality are blurred. For example, for his first solo museum exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, May 27-Oct. 2, 2005, Violette erected a life-sized recreation of a burned-out church on a black stage, inspired by an image from {{the cover of a}} black metal record and surrounded by a 5.1 surround score composed by Thorns Ltd consisting of a varied backdrop of ambiences ( [...] www.thornsltd.no [...] ). According to Violette, the inspiration of the piece was a series of instances of arson committed by rival metal enthusiasts in Norway, which culminated in the 1993 knife murder of Øystein Aarseth, guitarist of the black metal band Mayhem by Varg Vikernes of the band Burzum.|$|E

5000|$|Where the legion {{was based}} when it {{received}} these titles from Gallienus is uncertain. Other {{things being equal}} {{one would have thought}} that Valerian, father and co-regent with Gallienus, would have wanted {{to take it to the}} east with him in the late 250s and that it would have been involved in his defeat and capture by King Saporof the Persians at Edessa in 260. Since it continued as a functioning unit and avoided the subsequent pit-falls of <b>over-identification</b> with the rebellion of the Macrianii and Palmyra's bid for autonomy under Zenobia, and given the honorific title appearing on coins of Gallienus, it is probable that it was under the command of Gallienus, not his father. However unlikely, it is possible that it would have returned to Europe as part of the army of the Macrianii and was forgiven by Gallienus after the latter were defeated. Besides an inscription from Macedonia giving thanks to the god Jupiter for the safety and well-being, [...] "pro salute et incolumitate," [...] of Gallienus, and an inscription dated 242 CE from Rome giving thanks to the legion's [...] "Genius Gordiana and to Fortuna" [...] for keeping safe emperor Gordian and his spouse, there is little known regarding its fortunes in this period.|$|E
5000|$|In 2010, {{the state}} of Pennsylvania {{provided}} $1,026,815,000 for special education services. This funding is {{in addition to the}} state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. [...] The Special Education funding structure is through the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds and state appropriations. IDEA funds are appropriated to the state on an annual basis and distributed through intermediate units (IUs) to school districts, while state funds are distributed directly to the districts. Total funds that are received by school districts are calculated through a formula. The Pennsylvania Department of Education oversees four appropriations used to fund students with special needs: Special Education; Approved Private Schools; Pennsylvania Chartered Schools for the Deaf and Blind; and Early Intervention. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district’s students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student’s needs accrue the same level of costs. <b>Over-identification</b> of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of their students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education. The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students. In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive that schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports.|$|E
5000|$|The {{concept of}} {{mindfulness}} and self-compassion {{has been around}} for over 2500 years, and is rooted in Eastern traditional Buddhist philosophy and Buddhist meditation. In Buddhist philosophy, mindfulness and compassion is considered to be two wings of one bird, with each concept overlapping one another but producing benefits for wellbeing. The word Mindfulness is the English translation of the word Vipassan, which a combination of two words Vi, meaning in a special way and Passana, to observe, hence implying to observe in a special way. Compassion (karunaa) can be defined as an emotion that elicits the wanting to be free from suffering. Mindfulness in the context of self-compassion comprises acknowledging one's painful experiences in a balanced way that neither ignores, or ruminates on the disliked characteristics of oneself or life. According to Neff (2012) it is essential to be mindful of one's own personal suffering in order to extend compassion towards one's self. However it is essential to pay attention to self suffering in a grounded way in order to avoid [...] "over-identification". Mindfulness tends to focus on the internal experience such as sensation, emotion and thoughts rather than focusing on the experiencer. Self-compassion focuses on soothing and comforting the self when faced with distressing experiences. Self-compassion is composed of three components; self kindness verses self-judgement, a sense of common humanity versus isolation and mindfulness versus <b>over-identification</b> when confronting painful thoughts and emotions.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAlthough self-compassion is {{considered}} a promising change agent {{in the treatment of}} PTSD, no studies of this hypothesis exist. This study examined the within-person relationship of self-compassion components (self-kindness, common humanity, mindfulness, self-judgment, isolation, <b>over-identification)</b> and subsequent PTSD symptoms over the course of therapy. Method: PTSD patients (n = 65) were randomized to either standard prolonged exposure, which includes imaginal exposure (IE) to the traumatic memory, or modified prolonged exposure, where imagery re-scripting (IR) of the memory replaced IE as the imagery component of prolonged exposure in a 10 week residential program. They were assessed weekly on self-compassion and PTSD symptom measures. The centering method of detrending was used to separate the variance related to the within-person process of change over the course of treatment from between-person variance. Results: The self-compassion components self-kindness, self-judgment, isolation, and <b>over-identification</b> had a within-person effect on subsequent PTSD symptoms. These relationships were independent of therapy form. The within-person relationship between self-judgment and subsequent PTSD symptoms was stronger in patients with higher initial self-judgment. By contrast, there were few indications that within-person variations in PTSD symptoms predict subsequent self-compassion components. Conclusion: The results support the role of self-compassion components in maintaining PTSD and imply the recommendation to facilitate decrease of self-judgment, isolation, and <b>over-identification</b> and increase of self-kindness in the treatment of PTSD patients. The reduction of self-judgment appears to be most important, especially for patients with a high initial level of self-judgment...|$|E
