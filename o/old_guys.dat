5|$|Right now, we are {{currently}} pursuing a long arch series for cable. We wondered, should we do a sequel to the first one or do we do a remake? We {{came up with a}} 'requel' – it's a sequel and a remake. We've been developing this for a while. It's a trilogy in four parts, and it really follows the continuing adventures of new people who are experiencing this phenomenon of a Klown invasion, {{and once in a while}} you see some of the <b>old</b> <b>guys</b> pop up and hear their stories – find out what happened over the last 25 years. It's fucking great.|$|E

500|$|Comments from Darryl McDaniels, AKA DMC of Run-D.M.C., {{make this}} {{connection}} to the underground explicit: [...] "hat's exactly what we did. We didn't really think it was pioneering, we just did what rappers did before us was doing on tapes. When {{a lot of the}} <b>old</b> <b>guys,</b> like Kool Moe Dee, The Treacherous Three, and Grandmaster Flash, got in the studio, they never put their greatness on records. Me and Run and Jay would listen ... and we'd say, 'They didn't do that shit last night in the Bronx!' ... So we said that we weren't going to be fake. We ain't gonna wear no costumes. We're gonna keep it real." ...|$|E
500|$|When she was 14 years old, she led her New South Wales side to a {{national}} championship gold.

Those <b>old</b> <b>guys</b> had seen a lot of basketball, and they were drooling." [...] As a competitor at the 1999 Australian Under-20 national championships, she won the Bob Staunton Award for the tournament MVP. She was described as a basketball prodigy {{by the time she was}} seventeen years old.|$|E
500|$|A {{graduate}} of Columbia University architecture school, Kosinski's knowledge of architecture was pivotal in conceptualizing the Tron: Legacy universe. His approach in cultivating a prototype {{was different from}} other film directors because, according to Kosinski, he came [...] "from a design point of view"; [...] "Some of my favorite directors come from outside of the film business, so that made my approach different from other directors, but a design background makes sense for a movie like this because the whole world {{has to be made}} from scratch." [...] Lisberger would later state that he left the sequel to a different production team because [...] "after thirty years I don’t want to compete with myself", and to showcase how the next generation dealt with the themes contained in Tron - [...] "If I brought my network in, it would be a little bit like one of those Clint Eastwood movies where all the <b>old</b> <b>guys</b> go to space." [...] Lisberger added that [...] "I dig this role of being the Obi-Wan or the Yoda on this film more than being the guy in the trenches", stating that unlike Kosinski his age was a hindering factor - [...] "I cannot work sixteen hours a day staring at twenty-five monitors for most of that time." ...|$|E

5000|$|On January 11, 2008, at 12:46 PM {{local time}} (1846 UTC), the tower {{collapse}}d. [...] The {{cause of the}} collapse remains unknown.

500|$|Weiss {{additionally}} {{spoke about}} the introduction of Lyanna Mormont in the series, with Weiss saying, [...] "We were excited {{about the prospect of}} the character because she's mentioned in passing in the previous season," [...] referring to her letter to Stannis denying him men, and swearing fealty to House Stark. Weiss added, [...] "The more we thought about it, Jon is going to come up against so many <b>old</b> <b>guys</b> with beards in the North that like 'What if she was a tougher audience?' It seemed like an inherently fun scene to watch, it also is terrifying because it's putting a lot of dramatic weight on the shoulders of somebody who needs to be very young." [...] David Benioff concluded the featurette speaking about the Ironborn story, noting [...] "Yara's not a therapist, in our kind of sense of the word, she's not there to tell him to 'buck up' and 'everything's going to be okay,' it's a pretty brutal kind of therapy, but that's who they are, I mean they're essentially a Viking people. There's not {{a lot of room for}} sort of soft, and gentle psychology. I think it's the kind of tough love Theon needed at this point, and when he finally raises his eyes, and looks into her eyes, we see a glimpse of the old Theon that had been lost for so long." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Firefly" [...] was co-written by co-showrunners J.H. Wyman and Jeff Pinkner, {{while being}} {{directed}} by Supernatural veteran Charles Beeson. On October 20, 2010, TV Guide announced that Back to the Future star Christopher Lloyd had been cast {{in an upcoming}} episode as [...] "Walter's musical hero". Noble explained Lloyd's role: [...] "We all know how much Walter loves music, right? Well this fellow {{was one of his}} icons. He adored this man. So Walter gets to {{be a bit of a}} fanboy". Lloyd began shooting the episode in late October. Soon before the episode aired, Lloyd told reporters [...] "I was very excited for this role. My character is going through an experience he never expected to happen to him, and he's adjusting to that." [...] Lloyd also added he felt welcomed in as a part of the ensemble cast. In a conference call interview with journalists, John Noble explained that [...] "probably the best fun that I've had [...] was doing the stuff with Chris Lloyd, because it was two crazy <b>old</b> <b>guys</b> just trying desperately to communicate with each other. We had a lot of laughs. There was a common thread of trying to find the music again, because Chris' character had forgotten how to play the piano, so we go through this journey of bringing the music back to him, and [...] thrill to Walter. This happens all the way through this very complicated episode".|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} Quiet during a June 2013 {{interview}} with Famitsu, Kojima replied: [...] "In the game, Quiet {{is the main}} heroine.

2500|$|In 1989, Fender {{teamed up}} with fellow Tex–Mex musicians Doug Sahm, Flaco Jiménez, and Augie Meyers to form the Texas Tornados, whose work meshed conjunto, Tejano, R, country, and blues to wide acclaim. When the Texas Tornados went to {{audition}} for Warner Bros. Records, Fender {{did not think that}} the group was strong enough, so he brought his own band. The audition was nearly a bust, because he played country music and that was not what the executives were looking for. Fender was persuaded to play some vintage rock and blues numbers which was what the executives were looking for, and was subsequently given a record contract. After being a solo act, Fender was not sure if signing with a group was a good thing, but according to Fender, he [...] "just wanted to record for a major label." [...] The group released four albums and won a Grammy in 1990 for Best Mexican American Performance for the track [...] "Soy de San Luis". Fender described the group in this way: [...] "You've heard of New Kids on the Block? Well, we're the <b>Old</b> <b>Guys</b> in the Street." [...] Following the death of Sahm, the Tornados' production slowed. A live 1990 appearance on TV's Austin City Limits, one of three the group made, was released in 2005 as part of the Live From Austin, Texas, series.|$|E
2500|$|The former {{trend in}} Disney's {{hand-drawn}} features where {{the characters and}} cinematography were influenced by a CGI-look has been abandoned. Andreas Deja, a veteran Disney animator who supervised the character of Mama Odie, says [...] "I always thought that maybe we should distinguish ourselves {{to go back to}} what 2D is good at, which is focusing on what the line can do rather than volume, which is a CG kind of thing. So we are doing less extravagant Treasure Planet kind of treatments. You have to create a world but [...] What we're trying to do with Princess and the Frog is hook up with things that the <b>old</b> <b>guys</b> did earlier. It's not going to be graphic...". Deja also mentions that Lasseter was aiming for the Disney sculptural and dimensional look of the 1950s: [...] "All those things that were non-graphic, which means go easy on the straight lines and have one volume flow into the other– an organic feel to the drawing." [...] Lasseter also felt that traditional animation created more character believability. For example, with Louis the alligator, created by Eric Goldberg, Lasseter said: [...] "It's the believability of this large character being able to move around quite like that." [...] Choreographer Betsy Baytos was brought by the directors to lead a team of eccentric dancers that gave reference to make each character a different style of movement. The character design tried to create beautiful drawings through subtle shapes, particularly for most characters being human. For the frog versions of Tiana and Naveen, while the animators started with realistic designs, they eventually went for cutesy characters [...] "removing all that is unappealing in frogs", similar to Pinocchios Jiminy Cricket.|$|E
