5|$|The second Avrocar had logged about 75 {{flight hours}} {{at the end of}} the flight testing. Judged by its performance, the Avrocar was an abject failure: it couldn't lift itself safely more than a few feet off the ground, and its bulbous design {{limiting}} high-speed performance accompanied by unbearable heat and screaming exhaust noise, made it impractical for the military. Although considered a technical failure, its design would be prophetic: it was a rubber skirt shy of being one of the world's first hovercraft, the Saunders Roe SR.N1 also taking off in 1959. Nevertheless, company designer John Frost applied for a number <b>of</b> <b>patents</b> in Canada, the UK and the U.S. that established the pivotal role that the Avrocar and related Avro experimental vehicles made in the VTOL world.|$|E
5|$|In May 1972, Nutting Associates chief {{engineer}} Nolan Bushnell, {{designer of the}} first commercial arcade video game, Computer Space, saw {{a demonstration of the}} Odyssey at a dealership. Inspired, when he quit Nutting to start his own company, Atari, he assigned Allan Alcorn to create a cheap ping pong arcade game as a training exercise, though he did not tell Alcorn that it was for training nor that the idea was based on the Odyssey Table Tennis game. Alcorn soon developed Pong, which Bushnell recognized as a potential hit, and it became the company's first game. Pong was very successful, and in turn helped drive sales of the Odyssey; Baer once noted that customers bought the console because of Table Tennis, in turn because of Pong, and joked that they may as well have stopped designing games after that game card. In 1974, however, Magnavox sued Atari along with several competitors including Nutting, Allied Leisure, Bally Midway, and Williams Electronics for infringing on Baer's patents for video games played on a television screen. Baer has stated that the lawsuits were not filed right away because Magnavox and Sanders needed to wait until they could expect to be awarded more money than it would cost to pursue the suits. The root of the conflict was a pair <b>of</b> <b>patents</b> by Baer—one which described how the Odyssey showed player-controlled objects, or dots, on a video monitor and described a number of games that could be played with the system, and an earlier one that went into detail about how the Odyssey used that system to have two dots collide with each other and have one bounce off, specifically using a game of ping pong as an example.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} based on a {{literature}} review and small-scale study investigating the advances in the dissemination <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> information and how this has impacted on the users and suppliers <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> information. The study took the form of a survey using postal questionnaires and both telephone and face-to-face interviews. The volume <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> information is increasing each year. New technologies in the electronic storage and retrieval <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> data have revolutionized the accessibility of this type of scientific and technical information. The proliferation <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> databases indicates their technological and legal importance in the global market place. This paper reports the findings of the survey and concludes that paper-based patent information is still a popular means <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> information dissemination due to continued user insistence. However, more and more patent information providers are supplying patent data in electronic form; such as on magnetic tapes, online, CD-ROMs, diskettes, etc. The emergence of the Internet and satellite systems as a means of transporting large numbers of documents in electronic form, at high speeds around the world, is also seen as a major advance in the dissemination <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> information. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose This paper aims {{to study}} the effects of the {{strength}} <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> enforcement on economic growth following the signing of the agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights and the role of inward foreign direct investment (FDI) flows in mediating and enhancing this relationship. Design/methodology/approach Following a generalized method of moments methodology, use is made of a new longitudinal index measuring the strength of enforcement-related aspects <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> systems. Findings Stronger levels <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> enforcement have a significant positive effect on the economic growth of both developed and developing countries. Importantly, inward FDI flows have a mediating role in positively boosting this effect for all countries and particularly for developed countries. Originality/value This is the first empirical study {{of the role of the}} strength <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> enforcement (“law in action”) in stimulating economic growth, as previous empirical studies have focused on the effect of the strength <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> law protection (“law on the books”). The failure in the past to allow for “law in action” was mainly due to the lack of available data that could proxy for the strength <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> enforcement levels in a country. This study utilizes a newly published, longitudinal index that captures the strength of the enforcement-related aspects <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> systems...|$|R
40|$|Global {{standards}} <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> protection {{have been}} strengthened and harmonized in recent years. Despite the heated policy debates and theoretical controversies, empirical {{studies of the}} consequences for innovative activity are scant. This paper contributes to the debate by providing an empirical analysis of the effects <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> strength on different aspects of innovative activity, namely firm-level research and development (R&D), domestic patenting, and foreign patenting. The analysis employs an updated index <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> rights. The results show the complexity of evaluating the effects <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> reform on innovative activity, since the effects vary nonlinearly (depending on the initial level <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> strength) and vary by a country's level of economic development. Overall, for developing economies, patent strength negatively affects domestic patent filings and insignificantly affects R&D and foreign patent filings. For developed economies, patent strength positively affects R&D and domestic patent filings, and negatively affects foreign patent filings, after some critical level <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> protection is reached.
