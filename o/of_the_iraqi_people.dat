He stated that Iraq was [...] "a clear and present danger to the United States of America", and voted accordingly for the Iraq War Resolution in October 2002. He predicted that U.S. forces would be treated as liberators by a large number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>people.</b> In May 2003, McCain voted against the second round of Bush tax cuts, saying it was unwise at a time of war. By November 2003, after a trip to Iraq, he was publicly questioning Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, saying that more U.S. troops were needed; the following year, McCain announced that he had lost confidence in Rumsfeld.|$|E

2500|$|In 2003, from March 19 to May 1, the United States {{launched}} {{an invasion of}} Iraq, {{which led to the}} collapse of the Iraq government and the eventual capture of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, with whom the U.S. had long-standing tense relations. The reasons for the invasion cited by the Bush administration included the spreading of democracy, the elimination {{of weapons of mass destruction}} (a key demand of the UN as well, though later investigations found parts of the intelligence reports to be inaccurate), and the liberation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>people.</b> Despite some initial successes early in the invasion, the continued Iraq War fueled international protests and gradually saw domestic support decline as many people began to question whether or not the invasion was worth the cost. In 2007, after years of violence by the Iraqi insurgency, President Bush deployed more troops in a strategy dubbed [...] "the surge". While the death toll decreased, the political stability of Iraq remained in doubt.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a result}} of {{traveling}} to Iraq four times, the latest being in September 2007, Nelson took the position that a transition of the mission was necessary in Iraq {{as opposed to a}} full withdrawal of troops. [...] His view was supported by the Jones Commission on September 6, 2007 when General James L. Jones presented a report to Congress claiming that, [...] "The circumstances of the moment may continue to present the opportunity for considering a shift in the disposition and employment of our forces... such a strategy would include placing increasing responsibilities for the internal security of the nation on the ISF, especially in urban areas. Coalition forces could be re-tasked to better ensure the territorial defense of the state by increasingly concentrating on the eastern and western borders and the active defense of the critical infrastructures essential to Iraq." [...] The premise that stability in Iraq would only be achieved through political reconciliation acted on through legislation, a view long held by Nelson, was also recommended by Jones, reporting, [...] "The future of Iraq… hinges on the ability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>people</b> and the government {{to begin the process of}} achieving national reconciliation and to ending sectarian violence." ...|$|E
40|$|After <b>the</b> American {{invasion}} <b>of</b> Iraq in 2003, neoliberal hawks in the Bush administration embraced <b>the</b> goals <b>of</b> liberating <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>people</b> {{from economic}} constraints. This fast regime change, however, soon {{turned into a}} long quagmire that required a nation-building effort, reflecting <b>the</b> language <b>of</b> modernization theory. Thus, in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Iraq War, two distinct and opposing theories of economic development—neoliberalism and modernization—merged together. What made this possible was <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> analyzing American history through a lens of exceptionalism, {{as well as the}} transformative moment in the post-Cold War 1990 s that began to remake the Middle East as <b>the</b> next adversary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American superpower. This article uses this episode to suggest that intellectual histories of political economy need to reconsider narratives that present dominant theories through rigid periodization, while relying on works from Walt Rostow, David Harvey, Benjamin Barber, Timothy Mitchell, and Michael Latham, as well as rhetoric from George W. Bush and other neoliberal voices around the invasion...|$|R

Both orders further antagonized <b>the</b> Sunnis <b>of</b> Anbar. Many Sunnis took great pride in <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Army and viewed its disbanding as an act <b>of</b> contempt towards <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>people.</b> <b>The</b> dissolution also put {{hundreds of thousands of}} Anbaris out of work as many were members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Army or the party.

40|$|Iraq {{contains}} many different {{ethnic and religious}} groups and as <b>of</b> that reason <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>people</b> {{do not have a}} common national identity.

The paper argues that because of these inefficiencies new identity groups are forming that have political opinions in common instead of ethnic traits or religious beliefs. To have a basic definition of democracy we use <b>the</b> theory <b>of</b> Fukuyama as a basis as well as Habermas’ ideas on deliberative democracy.

40|$|Following the {{intervention}} in Iraq by coalition forces one decade ago, the Bush Administration underwent an enormous and unprecedented project {{to bring the}} ‘Western’ liberal model of democracy to Iraq. For {{the first few years}} the project to bring democracy to Iraq had its share <b>of</b> successes as <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>people</b> proved themselves capable of understanding and utilizing democratic mechanisms and institutions. This culminated in a series of nation-wide elections from 2005 onwards that brought a democratically elected government to power (Isakhan, 2012). However, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unfortunate consequences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war and the US effort to bring democracy to Iraq was that many key ethno-religious political factions viewed it as an opportunity to pedal their own relatively narrow and very divisive political rhetoric (Davis, 2007). This meant that <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> government was constituted not so much by a body who wanted to draw Iraq together behind a common ideology and to work towards a collective and egalitarian future, as it was by representatives who would fight on behalf of their ethno-religious constituencies. Not surprisingly, a great deal of academic literature has emerged which has analysed and criticised the formal political parties and institutions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> post-Saddam era (Dawisha, 2009). Indeed, <b>the</b> bulk <b>of</b> contemporary scholarship on Iraqi politics focuses on issues such as: the increasingly authoritarian tendencies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> government; <b>the</b> obstinacy and ineptitude of many elements of Iraq’s political elite; the systemic corruption that is hollowing out <b>the</b> coffers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state; the moribund bureaucracy that are struggling to deliver basic services and; <b>of</b> course, <b>the</b> deep-seated divisions within and between those that represent Iraq’s three main ethno-religious blocks: the Shia Arabs, the Sunni Arabs and the Kurds...|$|R
