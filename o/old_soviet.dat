25|$|TATA Kestrel -A modern {{armoured}} {{personnel carrier}} developed by Tata Motors and the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). It is developed {{with the intention}} to replace age <b>old</b> <b>Soviet</b> era BMPs and APCs in service with Indian army. Expected to join Indian Army by 2017.|$|E
25|$|When the Soviet Union was {{dissolved}} and {{the fifteen}} {{republics of the}} Soviet Union became independent states, the copyright law of the USSR also split into fifteen independent copyright laws, {{each with its own}} jurisdiction defined by the territory of the new successor state of the Soviet Union. All these successor states initially took over the <b>old</b> <b>Soviet</b> legislation.|$|E
5000|$|Honored Artist of the Byelorussian SSR (Russian Заслуженный деятель искусств Белорусской ССР) is the English {{translation}} {{of two different}} awards of the Byelorussian SSR, the <b>older</b> <b>Soviet</b> forms {{of two of the}} modern orders, decorations, and medals of Belarus.|$|R
50|$|In 1987, Iran {{bought the}} 170 mm KOKSAN {{self-propelled}} cannon from North Korea, {{where it was}} made, possibly from <b>older</b> <b>Soviet</b> tubes. At the time, using rocket-assisted projectile, it had the longest range of any artillery piece in the world.|$|R
50|$|Maersk also {{secured a}} 49-percent stake in Estonian Air, after having beaten SAS in a {{privatization}} tender. Two of Maersk Air's Fokker 50s were leased to Estonian Air, who also took delivery of two 737-500s, replacing the <b>older</b> <b>Soviet</b> fleet.|$|R
25|$|In 2010, Fidel Castro, in {{agreement}} with Raúl Castro's reformist sentiment, admitted that the Cuban model based on the <b>old</b> <b>Soviet</b> model of centralized planning was no longer sustainable. They encouraged {{the creation of a}} co-operative variant of socialism where the state plays a less active role in the economy and the formation of worker-owned co-operatives and self-employment enterprises.|$|E
25|$|In April 2008, a new {{memorial}} to Yeltsin was dedicated in Moscow's Novodevichy cemetery, to mixed reactions. At the memorial service, a military chorus performed Russia's national anthem – an anthem that was changed {{shortly after the}} end of Yeltsin's term, to follow the music of the <b>old</b> <b>Soviet</b> anthem, with lyrics reflecting Russia's new status.|$|E
25|$|The {{analysis}} of the succession of states {{with respect to the}} 15 post-Soviet states is complex. The Russian Federation is seen as the legal continuator state and is for most purposes the heir to the Soviet Union. It retained ownership of all former Soviet embassy properties, as well as the <b>old</b> <b>Soviet</b> UN membership and permanent membership on the Security Council.|$|E
5000|$|P 205 (First hull {{converted}} from <b>older</b> <b>Soviet</b> Project 1400 Grif-class into new Orbi-class). Was in maintenance status when war with Russian Federation began August 2008. Vessel was scuttled by Russian forces {{at the dock}} in Poti. Subsequently, refloated September 2008.|$|R
25|$|The M-10 {{was much}} more {{advanced}} design compared to <b>older</b> <b>Soviet</b> 152mm howitzers. It had modern split trail carriage, which allowed for much larger traverse. The trails were of riveted construction. The carriage was equipped with suspension and with wheels from the ZiS-5 truck, meaning higher transportation speed.|$|R
50|$|After the {{collapse}} of the <b>Soviet</b> Union, the <b>oldest</b> <b>Soviet</b> paper founded in 1903, Pravda, split into three different papers. Significant members of the main editorial staff (Viktor Afanasiev, Gennady Seleznev, Yuri Zhukov, Vera Tkachenko and Vadim Gorshenin) left Pravda to form the online news & opinion website Pravda.ru.|$|R
25|$|The 1980s wave of Mikhail Gorbachev's glasnost ("publicity") policy refuted an <b>old</b> <b>Soviet</b> {{version of}} the 1921-24 events. The first Soviet historian, who attempted, in 1988, to revise the {{hitherto}} commonly accepted interpretation of the Soviet-Georgian war, was a notable Georgian scholar, Akaki Surguladze, ironically the same historian whose 1982 monograph described the alleged Georgian worker revolt as a truly historical event.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, {{many of the}} <b>old</b> <b>Soviet</b> landmarks, such as Rossiya Hotel or Voentorg, were reconstructed or demolished, as well as such {{historical}} buildings as several old buildings around the Kadashi Church in {{the proximity of the}} Moscow Kremlin. Many neighbourhoods, like Zamoskvorechye, have been dramatically changed. Sculptor Zurab Tsereteli enjoyed Luzhkov's personal support in setting many of his works over the city.|$|E
25|$|The {{implementation}} act {{for the new}} copyright law, law no. 5352-1 of July 9, 1993, {{stated that}} the copyright provisions from the 1991 Fundamentals were invalidated. It also stated that the new copyright law applied to all works on which the 50-year term for copyrights and neighbouring rights had not yet elapsed in 1993. Subsequently, a discussion amongst copyright specialists erupted about whether this made the law applied retroactively, restoring copyrights on works on which the shorter copyright terms from the Soviet-era had already expired or which had not been copyrighted at all under Soviet law. The question was resolved definitively only in 2006, when the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation confirmed the retroactivity of the 1993 law, explaining that it placed even works under copyright again if their <b>old,</b> <b>Soviet</b> 25-year term had already expired. For the neighbouring rights, which hadn't existed in Soviet times, the law granted those rights retroactively. The 1993 copyright law thus rendered the <b>old</b> <b>Soviet</b> legislation largely obsolete in Russia; it remained applicable only to copyright violations that had occurred before August 3, 1993.|$|E
50|$|The M-10 {{was much}} more {{advanced}} design compared to <b>older</b> <b>Soviet</b> 152 mm howitzers. It had modern split trail carriage, which allowed for much larger traverse. The trails were of riveted construction. The carriage was equipped with suspension and with wheels from the ZiS-5 truck, meaning higher transportation speed.|$|R
50|$|There {{is a high}} {{presence}} of military equipment at this airport, there are large numbers of <b>older</b> <b>Soviet</b> jets such as MiG-15's lined up in sidings next to the runway and many utility vehicles/jeeps. Whether or not these are operational is unknown, but highly unlikely given their apparent condition.|$|R
50|$|Parachutes {{are used}} to slow down {{vehicles}} travelling very fast. Parachutes {{have been used in}} land, air and space vehicles such as the ThrustSSC, Eurofighter Typhoon and Apollo Command Module. Some <b>older</b> <b>Soviet</b> passenger jets had braking parachutes for emergency landings. Boats use similar devices called sea anchors to maintain stability in rough seas.|$|R
25|$|While {{a part of}} the Soviet Union, Belarus {{used the}} laws common for all Soviet republics. As such, {{homosexuality}} was considered illegal. Sexual relationships between females have never been illegal in Belarus (though lesbians could be sent to mental institutions if discovered) while those between males were frequently prosecuted. Words such as homosexuality or gay were not present in any <b>old</b> <b>Soviet</b> code and the Soviet juridical system used the term sodomy.|$|E
25|$|During the Soviet era, {{the rebels}} were persecuted and the {{uprising}} was censored {{out of the}} history books. Memoirs and studies published mainly by Lithuanian-Americans inflated {{the total number of}} the Lithuanians activists to 90,000 or 113,000 and casualties to 2,000 or 6,000. After Lithuania regained independence in 1990 and new documents became available, historians have revised the estimates to 16,000–20,000 active participants and 600 casualties. Most of the rebels were young men, between 18 and 25 years <b>old.</b> <b>Soviet</b> losses are estimated at 5,000 men.|$|E
25|$|On July 19, 1995, Federal Law 110-FL {{changed the}} {{copyright}} law, strengthening the measures for protecting copyrights against infringements. Law 110-FL also made corresponding amendments in the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation and in related laws. Three years later, a governmental decree clarified that for Soviet films, {{the director and}} other persons identified by the 1993 law as authors were indeed to be considered the authors and entitled to royalties for uses of these films, and not, as had been the case under the <b>old</b> <b>Soviet</b> law, the film studios.|$|E
50|$|The {{structure}} of Government of the Russian Federation {{from the time}} the state formed in 1991 underwent several major changes. In the first years governing bodies, primarily different Ministries, were under massive reorganizations in order to adopt the <b>older</b> <b>Soviet</b> governing networks to the new form of state. Many reshufflings and renamings were made.|$|R
50|$|In 2006 the Bulgarian {{government}} {{signed a}} contract with Alenia Aeronautica for the delivery of five C-27J Spartan transport aircraft in order to replace the <b>older</b> <b>Soviet</b> An-24 and An-26. The first Spartan arrived in 2007. Now, the contract has changed to the delivery of only 3 planes and final plane arrived on 31 March 2011.|$|R

25|$|Economic reforms also {{consolidated}} a semi-criminal oligarchy {{with roots}} in the <b>old</b> <b>Soviet</b> system. Advised by Western governments, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund, Russia embarked on the largest and fastest privatization that the world had ever seen in order to reform the fully nationalized Soviet economy. By mid-decade, retail, trade, services, and small industry was in private hands. Most big enterprises were acquired by their old managers, engendering a new rich (Russian tycoons) in league with criminal mafias or Western investors. That being said, there were corporate raiders such as Andrei Volgin engaged in hostile takeovers of corrupt corporations by the mid-1990s.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s {{there was the}} {{beginning}} of a transition in which <b>old</b> <b>Soviet</b> views were mixed with modern ones. The Soviet diplomat and KGB-agent in Helsinki Viktor Vladimirov wrote Kohti talvisotaa in 1995, a book in which he admitted that the Shelling of Mainila was a Soviet provocation, but insisted that the Finns had an assault plan against the Soviet Union; that Finland was under German influence; and that the Winter War was necessary to secure the city of Leningrad. In 1998, a group of Finnish-Russian historians published a book called Zimnyaya voina 1939–1940. It was a collection of different historical articles, and the book was published a year earlier in Finnish.|$|E
25|$|Further Russian public {{holidays}} include Defender of the Fatherland Day (23 February), which honors Russian men, especially those {{serving in the}} army; International Women's Day (8 March), which combines the traditions of Mother's Day and Valentine's Day; International Workers' Day (1 May), now renamed Spring and Labor Day; Victory Day (9 May); Russia Day (12 June); and Unity Day (4 November), commemorating the popular uprising which expelled the Polish-Lithuanian occupation force from Moscow in 1612. The latter is a replacement for the <b>old</b> <b>Soviet</b> holiday celebrating October Revolution of 1917 (again, it was falling on November because of the difference of calendars). Fireworks and outdoor concerts are common features of all Russian {{public holidays}}.|$|E
25|$|The first post-Soviet {{copyright}} {{law of the}} Russian Federation became effective on August 3, 1993. It completely replaced the <b>older</b> <b>Soviet</b> legislation {{that had been in}} effect until then. The new Copyright law of 1993 was based upon WIPO model laws and followed the continental European tradition: it clearly separated economic and moral rights, and it included detailed provisions for neighbouring rights.|$|R
2500|$|Geller {{played in}} 23 USSR Chess Championships, a record equalled by Mark Taimanov, {{achieving}} good results in many. He won in 1955 at Moscow (URS-ch22) when, despite losing five games, he finished equal first with 12/19, then defeated Smyslov in the playoff match by the score of +1 =6. He won his second title in 1979 at Minsk (URS-ch47) {{at the age}} of 54, making him the <b>oldest</b> <b>Soviet</b> champion.|$|R
50|$|Meridian {{satellites}} are {{the replacement}} for <b>older</b> <b>Soviet</b> molniya satellites, and some authors think some {{functions of the}} parus satellites. It was constructed by ISS Reshetnev and {{is believed to be}} based on the Uragan-M satellite bus, which has also been used for GLONASS navigation satellites. The first Meridian satellite was launched in 2006 and two of the six launched so far have failed - Meridian 2 due a problem with the Fregat upper stage and Meridian 5 due to a problem with the third-stage motor.|$|R
25|$|Under the 1993 {{copyright}} law, all Russian or Soviet {{works from}} the RSFSR published in 1943 or later, as well as works of authors who died in 1943 or later, became thus copyrighted in Russia in 1993. Because of the term extension of four years for authors who had lived during the Great Patriotic War, even some earlier works became subject to copyright. In the case of works formerly copyrighted under Soviet law, this amounted to a restoration of copyright; for the neighbouring rights, which hadn't existed in Soviet times, the law granted those rights retroactively. The 1993 copyright law thus rendered the <b>old</b> <b>Soviet</b> legislation largely obsolete in Russia; the former laws remained applicable only to copyright violations that had occurred before August 3, 1993.|$|E
25|$|A new {{military}} doctrine, promulgated in November 1993, implicitly acknowledged the contraction of the <b>old</b> <b>Soviet</b> military into a regional military power without global ambitions. In keeping {{with its emphasis}} on the threat of regional conflicts, the doctrine called for a smaller, lighter, and more mobile Russian military, with a higher degree of professionalism and with greater rapid-deployment capability. Such change proved extremely difficult to achieve. Under Pavel Grachev (Defence Minister from 1992 to 1996) little military reform took place, though there was a plan to create more deployable mobile forces. Later Defence Minister Rodionov (in office 1996-1997) had good qualifications but did not manage to institute lasting change. Only under Defence Minister Igor Sergeyev (in office 1997-2001) did a certain amount of limited reform begin, though attention focused upon the Strategic Rocket Forces.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 72 {{reactors}} were under construction {{at the beginning}} of 2014, the highest number in 25 years. Several of the under construction reactors are carry over from earlier eras; some are partially completed reactors on which work has resumed (e.g., in Argentina); some are small and experimental (e.g., Russian floating reactors); and some have been on the IAEA’s “under construction” list for years (e.g., in India and Russia). Reactor projects in Eastern Europe are essentially replacing <b>old</b> <b>Soviet</b> reactors shut down due to safety concerns. Most of the 2010 activity ― 30 reactors ― is taking place in four countries: China, India, Russia and South Korea. Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Iran are the only countries that are currently building their first power reactors, Iran's construction began decades ago.|$|E
