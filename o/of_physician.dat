40|$|Abstract Background Since {{the late}} 1980 s, {{the policy of}} the Japanese {{government}} regarding physician manpower has been to decrease the number of medical students. However, the shortage of doctors in Japan has become a social problem in recent years. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the numbers <b>of</b> <b>physicians</b> in Japan between 1996 and 2006 and the trends in distribution <b>of</b> <b>physicians.</b> Methods The time trends in number and distribution <b>of</b> <b>physicians</b> between 1996 and 2006 were analyzed. Gini coefficient, Atkinson index and Theil index were used as measures for mal-distribution <b>of</b> <b>physicians</b> to population. The distribution <b>of</b> <b>physicians</b> was visualized on a map by using geographic information system (GIS) software. Results The total number <b>of</b> <b>physicians</b> increased every year in the period from 1996 to 2006 but has remained below the international standard. All three measures <b>of</b> mal-distribution <b>of</b> <b>physicians</b> worsened after 2004, and the worsening was remarkable in the distribution <b>of</b> <b>physicians</b> working at hospitals. The number <b>of</b> <b>physicians</b> working at hospitals has significantly increased in urban areas but not in areas with low population densities. When medical interns were excluded from calculation, the measures of mal-distribution improved. Conclusion The problem of a doctor shortage in Japan is linked to both the shortage of absolute number <b>of</b> <b>physicians</b> and the mal-distribution <b>of</b> hospital <b>physicians.</b> The new postgraduate internship system might worsen this situation. </p...|$|R
