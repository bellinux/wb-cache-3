METHODS: The sample consisted of 29 cystic fibrosis patients, characterized based on anthropometric, genetic and bacterial colonization data. The patients were submitted to physical therapy sessions, involving re-education of the respiratory muscles, twice a week for four months. Spirometry, pressure manometry and anthropometry were performed before and after each session.

40|$|Abstract Background Acupuncture {{therapy for}} <b>obstructive</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>diseases</b> has been {{effectively}} used in clinical {{practice and the}} acupuncture points or acupoints of Zhongfu and Tiantu are commonly-used acupoints to treat patients with the diseases. Since the impaired mucociliary clearance {{is among the most}} important features of airway inflammation in most <b>obstructive</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>diseases,</b> the effect of needle puncture and electro-acupuncture at the specific acupoints on tracheal mucociliary clearance was investigated in anesthetized quails. Methods Mucociliary transport velocity on tracheal mucosa was measured through observing the optimal pathway, and fucose and protein contents in tracheal lavages were determined with biochemical methods. In the therapeutic group, needle puncture or electro-acupuncture stimulation to the acupoints was applied without or with constant current output in 2 mA and at frequency of 100 Hz for 60 minutes. In the sham group, electro-acupuncture stimulation to Liangmen was applied. Results Our present experiments demonstrated that the electro-acupuncture stimulation to Zhongfu and Tiantu significantly increased tracheal mucociliary transport velocity and decreased the content of protein in the tracheal lavage, compared with the control group. Moreover, either needle puncture or electro-acupuncture stimulation to Zhongfu and Tiantu significantly reverted the human neutrophil elastase-induced decrease in tracheal mucociliary transport velocity and human neutrophil elastase -induced increase in the contents of fucose and protein in the tracheal lavage, compared with the control group. Conclusion These results suggest that either needle puncture or electro-acupuncture stimulation to the effective acupoints significantly improves both airway mucociliary clearance and the airway surface liquid and that the improvements maybe ascribed to both the special function of the points and the substantial stimulation of electricity. </p...|$|R

40|$|CONTEXTO: A relação entre disfunções respiratórias e têmporo-mandibulares tem sido recentemente constatada pela incidência de dor {{orofacial}} entre indivíduos com história de doenças respiratórias obstrutivas tanto de vias aéreas superiores como nas inferiores. OBJETIVO: Avaliar comparativamente a mecânica ventilatória em indivíduos com disfunção têmporo-mandibular (DTM) e em indivíduos assintomáticos. MÉTODO: Participaram do estudo 35 voluntários, sendo 20 indivíduos com DTM e 15 assintomáticos. Os participantes foram avaliados para verificação da presença e grau de disfunção têmporo-mandibular. Realizou-se avaliação respiratória, por meio de inspeção do padrão e tipo ventilatório, medida dos perímetros torácicos, teste de força dos músculos respiratórios e histórico de enfermidade respiratória. RESULTADOS: Nos indivíduos com DTM, o modo respiratório bucal (30 %) e misto (15 %), bem como o padrão ventilatório apical (45 %) foram predominantes. Observou-se uma menor expansibilidade torácica e uma redução estatisticamente significante no índice de amplitude abdominal nos indivíduos com DTM. Estes indivíduos também apresentaram maior incidência de patologias respiratórias obstrutivas tanto de vias aéreas superiores (70 %) como inferiores (45 %) em relação aos assintomáticos. CONCLUSÃO: Os resultados indicam que existe uma influência da mecânica ventilatória sobre a ocorrência de disfunção têmporo-mandibular.

40|$|Each lung {{structure}} exhales {{a unique}} pattern of aerosols, {{which can be}} used to detect and monitor lung diseases non-invasively. The challenges are accurately interpreting the exhaled aerosol fingerprints and quantitatively correlating them to the lung diseases. In this study, we presented a paradigm of an exhaled aerosol test that addresses the above two challenges and is promising to detect the site and severity of lung diseases. This paradigm consists of two steps: image feature extraction using sub-regional fractal analysis and data classification using a support vector machine (SVM). Numerical experiments were conducted to evaluate the feasibility of the breath test in four asthmatic lung models. A high-fidelity image-CFD approach was employed to compute the exhaled aerosol patterns under different disease conditions. By employing the 10 -fold cross-validation method, we achieved 100 % classification accuracy among four asthmatic models using an ideal 108 -sample dataset and 99. 1 % accuracy using a more realistic 324 -sample dataset. The fractal-SVM classifier {{has been shown to be}} robust, highly sensitive to structural variations, and inherently suitable for investigating aerosol-disease correlations. For the first time, this study quantitatively linked the exhaled aerosol patterns with their underlying diseases and set the stage for the development of a computer-aided diagnostic system for non-invasive detection of <b>obstructive</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>diseases...</b>|$|R

Cases and controls were matched for gender and age, and conditional logistic regression was used in multivariate analysis considering other respiratory drugs, respiratory diagnosis and visit frequency, non-respiratory, non-cardiac comorbidities, and receipt of drugs for cardiovascular disease. In univariate analyses, BA, IB and ICS were all associated with hospitalizations for cardiovascular disease, but in multivariate analyses ICS did not increase risk while both BA and IB did. There were interactions between respiratory and cardiac drugs receipt in that bronchodilator associated risks were higher in people not taking cardiac drugs; this was especially true for stroke. There were strong interactions with specific cardiac drugs; for example, both BA and IB substantially increased the risk of supraventricular tachycardia in patients not anti-arryhthmic agents, but not in the presence of such agents.

40|$|Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) represents {{a major cause}} of loss of performance in the horse. The role of endothelin (ET), a potent bronchoconstrictive and vasoactive peptide, is currently being investigated in asthma and other <b>obstructive</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>diseases</b> in man. We have previously found elevated systemic and pulmonary endothelin levels in horses during exacerbation of COPD. In the present study, our aim was to examine possible variations in ET concentrations occurring during exercise in COPD horses. We compared the effects of intense treadmill exercise on the recovery of endothelin (ET) in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) as well as in arterial and venous blood, in a group of 5 healthy horses and a group of 5 COPD horses studied alternately in remission and while symptomatic. We also investigated the possible correlations between ET levels and pulmonary function tests during the study. While exercise did not affect the ET levels recovered in BALF among controls, it caused a significant increase (P = 0. 02) among symptomatic COPD horses. During remission, wide variations of ET levels among horses, at rest and during exercise, made any significant interpretation difficult. No correlation could be found between exercise-induced changes in ET concentrations and pulmonary function tests or changes in arterial oxygen tension with exercise. We conclude that exercise appears to affect the release of ET by the airways in COPD horses, in contrast to healthy horses. It is still unclear, however, whether these differences relate to adjustments of lung function during exercise. Peer reviewe...|$|R

A 549 cells and human primary bronchial epithelial cells were first treated with either IFN-b (500 IU/ml) or IFN-l 1 (500 ng/ml) for 18 h. For infection, two approaches were adopted: i) Continuous scenario: after pre-treatment, cells were infected immediately for 24 h with human rhinovirus 1 B (HRV 1 B) in IFN-containing medium, or were cultured for another 72 h in IFN-containing medium, and then infected for 24 h with HRV 1 B, ii) Pre-treatment scenario: IFN-containing medium was replaced after 18 h and cells were infected for 4 h either immediately after pre-treatment or after additional culturing for 72 h in IFN-free medium. The protective effect was evaluated in terms of {{reduction in the number}} of viral copies/infectious progeny, and enhanced expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs).

Spannagel, 1961) and Poland (M. Skulimowski, 1965). Professor Mieczyslaw Skulimowski has granted of speleotherapy in "Wieliczka" Salt Mine, the name of subterraneotherapy, soon to be also called the Skulimowski method. Number of speleotherapeutic centers and speleotherapy symposiums has increased considerably (H. Trimmel, 1994). Speleotherapy in the underground now is an effective therapeutic method for the treatment of <b>obstructive</b> <b>respiratory</b> tract <b>diseases,</b> especially of patients with bronchial asthma (BA), the upward and effective practice in Central and Eastern Europe, but also in the West: Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, Ukraine, Belarus, Hungary etc...|$|R
40|$|Forty {{patients}} (32 inpatients and 8 outpatients) {{with acute}} purulent exacerbations of <b>obstructive</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>disease</b> associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa were treated orally with 800 mg ofloxacin twice daily for seven days. Sputum was cultured before, {{during and after}} treatment. The drug was extremely well tolerated, only one patient discontinuing because of alleged nausea. The infection was completely eradicated, with excellent clinical results and negative sputum cultures, in 23 patients. In six others the Ps. aeruginosa infection was cleared although reinfection with different organisms followed. Five patients showed recurrence of the infection after apparent initial eradication, but Ps. aeruginosa persisted in three others. Three patients were not evaluable because of death, transfer elsewhere, or discontinuation. There was a slight tendency for the mean MICs to rise during treatment, owing to eradication of all highly sensitive strains. Resistance did not develop. These results suggest that purulent exacerbations of chronic respiratory disease caused by Ps. aeruginosa can safely be treated orally with 800 mg ofloxacin twice daily, but that further studies in outpatients should be performed...|$|E

Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a common disorder in childhood with high prevalence in syndromic subjects with craniofacial malformations. Proteus Syndrome (PS) is a rare hamartoneoplastic disorder associated with disproportionate and asymmetric overgrowth of body parts and hypertrophy or malformation of lymphatic tissues, such as palatine tonsils. We report {{a case of a}} 12 -year-old boy diagnosed with Proteus Syndrome (PS) and suffering from OSAS due to asymmetric palatine tonsillar hypertrophy, treated with partial resection of left tonsil. To avoid the risk of a general anesthesia and remove only the obstructive portion of the palatine tonsil bipolar radiofrequency-induced thermotherapy (RFITT) under local anesthesia was performed. Recovery of the <b>obstructive</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>disease</b> was obtained. To our knowledge, this is the first case reported in the literature of partial tonsillar resection performed in a patient with PS suffering from OSAS under local anesthesia. 1...|$|E
40|$|The diurnal {{variation}} (DV) in {{peak expiratory flow rate}} (PEFR) {{has been studied}} among 132 grain elevator workers who accomplished three daily measurements of PEFR during three weeks. DV was calculated as the difference between the highest and the lowest PEFR {{as a percentage of the}} mean PEFR on each day. For the whole group the median was 5. 9 %. DV was higher among smokers and among workers with work related pulmonary symptoms. Analysis of variance showed that only age (p = 0. 012) and smoking (p = 0. 016) had a significant effect on DV. Pulmonary symptoms, total IgE, and duration of occupation had no independent impact on DV, whereas the exposure level of grain dust tended (p = 0. 082) to have an independent effect. Twelve workers had an abnormally high DV (greater than 20 %), of whom seven showed no signs of <b>obstructive</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>disease</b> by spirometry. If only a single spirometric test had been performed the tentative diagnosis of bronchial asthma could have been missed in these seven workers...|$|E
40|$|Background and aim. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), {{although}} largely preventable, {{is a great}} health burden in all {{the countries}} worldwide. Statistics {{of morbidity and mortality}} of COPD show the need for correct management of the <b>disease.</b> Chronic <b>Obstructive</b> <b>Respiratory</b> <b>Diseases</b> (DRG 88) are in 9 th place for discharge in in-patient hospital admission. It is necessary to establish specific indicators which are efficacious and relevant for the patient, the doctor and the health manager. This study will analyse the information in respect of hospital admissions (Hospital discharge database) in Puglia for the period 2000 - 2005. Methods. The analysis was carried out utilising the Puglia Region hospital patient discharge database, selecting those patients with admission for chronic <b>respiratory</b> <b>disease</b> as principal or secondary diagnosis. Results. Chronic <b>respiratory</b> <b>diseases</b> are more frequent in males and in people over 45 years old with frequency increasing with age. Geographical distribution shows that there are greater rates of hospitalisation in big cities and in the neighbourhood of industrial areas. Although the trend over time is slight. A higher percentage of re-admission has been found for patients with COPD, and the interval between the two admissions occurs within one or two months; the diagnosis at the second admission is the same as for the first. 10. 6 % of discharge forms report one diagnosis, especially in patients older than 65 years of age. Little could be said about diagnostic procedures because these are not reported on the discharge form. Conclusion. Hospitalisation data confirms expectations regarding age and sex of patients. The high hospitalisation rates indicate that in-patients care still remains the only viable treatment for COPD and other chronic <b>respiratory</b> <b>diseases.</b> The high number of exacerbations reflect the absence of out-patients service or community care, and the same diagnosis in more than one episode shows the lack of efficiency of health services and disease management. This data is necessary to understand disease distribution and the modification of disease management in order to reduce health care costs, to increase efficacy in disease control and to limit repeated exacerbation and so to obtain the maximum benefit for the patients...|$|R
40|$|Bronchoconstriction is a {{characteristic}} symptom of various chronic <b>obstructive</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>diseases</b> such as {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) and asthma. Precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) are a suitable ex vivo model to study physiological mechanisms of bronchoconstriction in different species. In the present study, we established an ex vivo model of bronchoconstriction in non-human primates (NHPs). PCLS prepared from common marmosets, cynomolgus macaques, rhesus macaques, and anubis baboons were stimulated with increasing concentrations of representative bronchoconstrictors: methacholine, histamine, serotonin, leukotriene D 4 (LTD 4), U 46619, and endothelin- 1. Alterations in the airway caliber were measured and compared to previously published data from rodents, guinea pigs, and humans. Methacholine induced maximal airway constriction, varying between 74 and 88 % in all NHP species, whereas serotonin was ineffective. Histamine induced maximal bronchoconstriction of 77 to 90 % in rhesus macaques, cynomolgus macaques, and baboons, and a lesser constriction of 53 % in marmosets. LTD 4 was ineffective in marmosets and rhesus macaques, but induced a maximum constriction of 44 to 49 % in cynomolgus macaques and baboons. U 46619 and endothelin- 1 caused airway constriction in all NHP species, with maximum constrictions of 65 to 91 %, and 70 to 81 %, respectively. In conclusion, PCLS from NHPs represent a valuable ex vivo model for studying bronchoconstriction. All NHPs respond to mediators relevant to human airway {{disorders such as}} methacholine, histamine, U 46619, endothelin- 1 and are insensitive to the rodent mast cell product serotonin. Only PCLS from cynomolgus macaques and baboons, however, responded also to leukotrienes, suggesting that among all compared species, these two NHPs resemble the human airway mechanisms bes...|$|R
40|$|Macrophages {{are among}} the most {{abundant}} cells in the respiratory tract, and they can have strikingly different phenotypes within this environment. Our knowledge of the different phenotypes and their functions in the lung is sketchy at best, but they appear to be linked to the protection of gas exchange against microbial threats and excessive tissue responses. Phenotypical changes of macrophages within the lung are found in many <b>respiratory</b> <b>diseases</b> including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pulmonary fibrosis. This paper will give an overview of what macrophage phenotypes have been described, what their known functions are, what is known about their presence in the different <b>obstructive</b> and restrictive <b>respiratory</b> <b>diseases</b> (asthma, COPD, pulmonary fibrosis), and how they are thought to contribute to the etiology and resolution of these diseases. ...|$|R
