5000|$|PTWF {{has been}} working {{diligently}} to focus awareness {{of the world community}} on the existence of ancient Covenants of Protection. [...] "This is a message signed with the hand print of the founder of Islam, the Prophet Muhammad ibn Abdullah in 628 CE, as a covenant to those who adopt Christianity, near and far, we are with them. No <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> (Muslims) is to disobey the covenant till the Last Day (end of the world)." [...] The above quote is a partial translation of the document by Dr. Muqtedar Khan. The imprinted Covenant of Protection was written in 628 CE, as a guarantee of protection for the Christians of the Monastery of St. Catherine, at the base of Mount Sinai, which has remained safe under Muslim watch for 1,400 years. The breadth of the document in its entirety is stunning. It basically protects the right to property, freedom of religion, freedom of work, and security of person. There are no strings attached, and nothing is expected in return for such security. The simple act of being a Christian guarantees this protection.|$|E
