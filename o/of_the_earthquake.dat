5|$|During {{the time}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earthquake,</b> others {{believed}} that the destruction {{was a result of}} an underground nuclear explosion. Igor Nesterov, head of seismology of USSR, said the Leninakan seismic station was destroyed so there was no way of knowing whether it received reports of an earthquake coming its way, although Nesterovs' colleagues later said the station was not able to receive reports {{because of the lack of}} instruments it carried.|$|E

5|$|In Bucharest, the {{earthquake}} had an estimated intensity of VIII–IX on the Mercalli scale. It toppled church steeples and caused Cotroceni Monastery to collapse.

50|$|This is a megathrust {{earthquake}} which ruptured part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{boundary between}} the Nazca Plate and the South American Plate.

Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rupture zone <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1942 <b>earthquake</b> overlapped with that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1996 Nazca <b>earthquake.</b> <b>The</b> rupture zone <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1942 <b>earthquake</b> was about 40 km longer than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1996 <b>earthquake.</b> <b>The</b> epicenter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1942 <b>earthquake</b> was very close to, but slightly southeast <b>of,</b> that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1996 <b>earthquake.</b> <b>The</b> energy released by <b>the</b> 1942 <b>earthquake</b> was about 2.5×1017 Nm.|$|R

30|$|To model <b>the</b> <b>earthquakes,</b> <b>the</b> {{frequency}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earthquakes</b> EQ 4 - 4.9 {{is taken}} as the response variable.

In such a way, we try to investigate the relation between <b>the</b> <b>earthquakes</b> and <b>the</b> solar activities by comparing these models.

5|$|The first shock <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earthquake</b> {{occurred}} at 0:16 GMT and {{was followed by}} several strong aftershocks. The quake was most widely felt in the Chinandega and León departments of Nicaragua, though it was also felt elsewhere in Nicaragua at El Crucero, Managua and San Marcos and at San José in Costa Rica. It was the strongest seismic event to hit Nicaragua since the earthquake of 1972.|$|E

5|$|At {{least two}} episodes of {{earthquakes}} constitute the Nazko swarm. In the first seismic phase from October 9 to November 1, 2007, {{a total of}} 153 earthquakes took place. During the second seismic phase between September 25, 2007 and June 12, 2008, 4,428 earthquakes occurred. These two seismic episodes were cross-correlated by scientists to understand changes in the development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earthquake</b> swarm. Correlation coefficients were around 1.0 for {{the beginnings of the}} periods of activity, indicating almost identical situations, and then decayed to around 0.5, indicating a decrease in similarity between the later stages of the two events.|$|E

The quake was felt in Fairbanks, and it took 40 minutes for communications to be re-established with the Associated Press office in Seattle. When the connection was restored, the News-Miner sent the first reports <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earthquake</b> to the outside world. The quake also destroyed {{the offices of the}} Anchorage Times, the leading newspaper in that city. The News-Miner offered its press facilities to the Times, and the two papers shared a masthead as Anchorage recovered from the tremor.|$|E

Ten years after the 50 millionth rider, the park celebrated the Giant Dipper's 60 millionth rider on July 27, 2012. The park gave out trivia coasters leading up to the event.

5|$|In {{the wake}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earthquake,</b> {{multiple}} phone lines were down, and scattered power outages affected about 54,000 households. Moreover, at least 70 underground 11,000 volt cables sustained {{some degree of}} damage, contributing to the outages. The shaking ruptured local water mains, resulting in widespread flooding that affected several streets. Furthermore, officials ordered the closure of bridges in the area as a precautionary measure; one bridge {{was reported to have}} succumbed to the strong ground motions. Days after its occurrence, a small electrical fire ignited in a control panel at Christchurch Hospital due to dislodged wiring as a result of ongoing aftershocks.|$|E
5|$|Many {{buildings}} did {{not hold}} up to the shaking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earthquake</b> and those that did collapse often lacked any survival space, but lack of effective medical care and poor planning {{also contributed to the}} substantial scope of the disaster. Buildings that didn't collapse featured well-maintained masonry and skeletal components that were joined together adequately in a way that allowed for the building to resist seismic waves. Most bridges and tunnels and other public infrastructure withstood the earthquake but hospitals did not fare well. Most collapsed, killing two-thirds of the doctors, destroying equipment and medicine, and reducing the capacity to handle the critical medical needs in the region.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the more}} seriously damaged homes were of simple construction, with walls made of mud, adobe, or brick packed 40–50cm (16–20in) thick. These {{materials}} are generally more vulnerable to the force <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earthquake,</b> {{but some of the}} traditionally constructed homes sustained little or no damage. This was due to a range of factors, possibly including the height-to-width ratio, the lack of windows, {{and the quality of the}} materials used. In general, reinforced concrete-framed homes, built after the 1979 earthquake, were better able to withstand the earthquake. Those near the epicenter still sustained severe damage due to the weight of the roofs and the weak joint connections between major structural elements of the buildings.|$|E

5|$|The 1992 Nicaragua {{earthquake}} was {{the first}} tsunami earthquake to be captured on modern broadband seismic networks. The initial surface wave magnitude was estimated at 7.2. The shock occurred on the subduction interface between the Cocos and Caribbean Plates, an active zone of stress and deformation, and due {{to the absence of}} sediment on the ocean floor off Nicaragua, the slip propagated up-dip {{all the way to the}} trench bottom, a creator of large tsunamis. This occurrence of slip of a plate interface filled with soft subducted sediments caused the rupturing process to be slower than the average subduction zone thrust earthquakes while the focus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earthquake</b> was much shallower than the typical subduction zone earthquake.|$|E
