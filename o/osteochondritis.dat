5|$|In animals, OCD is {{considered}} a developmental and metabolic disorder related to cartilage growth and endochondral ossification. <b>Osteochondritis</b> itself signifies the disturbance of the usual growth process of cartilage, and OCD is the term used when this affects joint cartilage causing a fragment to become loose.|$|E
5|$|<b>Osteochondritis</b> dissecans is {{difficult}} to diagnose clinically as the animal may only exhibit an unusual gait. Consequently, OCD may be masked by, or misdiagnosed as, other skeletal and joint conditions such as hip dysplasia.|$|E
5|$|To {{diagnose}} <b>osteochondritis</b> dissecans, an X-ray, CT scan or MRI scan can {{be performed}} to show necrosis of subchondral bone, formation of loose fragments, or both. Occasionally a nuclear medicine bone scan is {{used to assess the}} degree of loosening within the joint.|$|E
5|$|In <b>osteochondritis</b> dissecans, {{fragments}} of cartilage or bone become loose within a joint, leading to pain and inflammation. These fragments are {{sometimes referred to}} as joint mice. OCD is a type of osteochondrosis in which a lesion has formed within the cartilage layer itself, giving rise to secondary inflammation. OCD most commonly affects the knee, although it can affect other joints such as the ankle or the elbow.|$|E
5|$|<b>Osteochondritis</b> dissecans (OCD or OD) {{is a joint}} {{disorder}} in which cracks form in the articular cartilage and the underlying subchondral bone. OCD usually causes pain and swelling of the affected joint which catches and locks during movement. Physical examination typically reveals an effusion, tenderness, and a crackling sound with joint movement.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} {{surgical}} versus non-surgical treatments for <b>osteochondritis</b> dissecans is controversial. Consequently, {{the type and}} extent of surgery necessary varies based on patient age, severity of the lesion, and personal bias of the treating surgeon—entailing an exhaustive list of suggested treatments. A variety of surgical options exist {{for the treatment of}} persistently symptomatic, intact, partially detached, and completely detached OCD lesions. Post-surgery reparative cartilage is inferior to healthy hyaline cartilage in glycosaminoglycan concentration, histological, and immunohistochemical appearance. As a result, surgery is often avoided if non-operative treatment is viable.|$|E
5|$|The {{prognosis}} after different treatments varies and {{is based}} on several factors which include the age of the patient, the affected joint, the stage of the lesion and, most importantly, the state of the growth plate. It follows that the two main forms of <b>osteochondritis</b> dissecans are defined by skeletal maturity. The juvenile form of the disease occurs in open growth plates, usually affecting {{children between the ages of}} 5 and 15 years. The adult form commonly occurs between ages 16 to 50, although it is unclear whether these adults developed the disease after skeletal maturity or were undiagnosed as children.|$|E
5|$|Trauma, {{rather than}} {{avascular}} necrosis, {{is thought to}} cause <b>osteochondritis</b> dissecans in juveniles. In adults, trauma {{is thought to be}} the main or perhaps the sole cause, and may be endogenous, exogenous or both. The incidence of repetitive strain injury in young athletes is on the rise and accounts for a significant number of visits to primary care; this reinforces the theory that OCD may be associated with increased participation in sports and subsequent trauma. High-impact sports such as gymnastics, soccer, basketball, lacrosse, football, tennis, squash, baseball and weight lifting may put participants at a higher risk of OCD in stressed joints (knees, ankles and elbows).|$|E
5|$|OCD {{occurs in}} 15 to 30 people per 100,000 {{in the general}} {{population}} each year. Although rare, it is an important cause of joint pain in physically active adolescents. Because their bones are still growing, adolescents are more likely than adults to recover from OCD; recovery in adolescents {{can be attributed to the}} bone's ability to repair damaged or dead bone tissue and cartilage in a process called bone remodeling. While OCD may affect any joint, the knee tends to be the most commonly affected, and constitutes 75% of all cases. Franz König coined the term <b>osteochondritis</b> dissecans in 1887, describing it as an inflammation of the bone–cartilage interface. Many other conditions were once confused with OCD when attempting to describe how the disease affected the joint, including osteochondral fracture, osteonecrosis, accessory ossification center, osteochondrosis, and hereditary epiphyseal dysplasia. Some authors have used the terms osteochondrosis dissecans and osteochondral fragments as synonyms for OCD.|$|E
25|$|<b>Osteochondritis</b> dissecans and elbow {{dysplasia}} in the forelimbs {{are difficult}} to diagnose as the animal may only exhibit an unusual gait, and may be masked by, or misdiagnosed as, hip dysplasia.|$|E
25|$|Like other warmblood registries, the AWÖ {{does not}} give {{breeding}} licenses to stallions with congenital disorders including cryptorchidism, malocclusion, <b>osteochondritis,</b> or impaired breathing. As a result, Austrian Warmbloods are healthy and robust.|$|E
25|$|<b>Osteochondritis</b> dissecans (OCD) is {{separation}} of immature articular cartilage from underlying bone. It {{is caused by}} osteochondrosis, which is characterized by abnormal endochondral ossification of epiphyseal cartilage. It is most commonly seen in the stifle, elbow, shoulder, and hock.|$|E
25|$|Elbow {{dysplasia}} is {{a condition}} found more commonly in large breeds. It incorporates several different hereditary conditions of the elbow, including <b>osteochondritis</b> of the medial condyle of the humerus, fragmentation of the medial coronoid process of the ulna, and ununited anconeal process of the ulna.|$|E
25|$|Two major {{trials of}} arthroscopic surgery for {{osteoarthritis}} {{of the knee}} found no benefit for these surgeries. Many medical insurance providers are now reluctant to reimburse surgeons and hospitals for what {{can be considered a}} procedure which seems to create the risks of surgery with questionable or no demonstrable benefit. However this is still a widely adopted treatment for a range of conditions associated with osteoarthritis, including labral tears, femoroacetabular impingement, <b>osteochondritis</b> dissecans.|$|E
25|$|A dog may misuse {{its rear}} legs, or adapt its gait, to {{compensate}} for pain in the forelimbs, notably osteoarthritis, <b>osteochondritis</b> (OCD) or shoulder or elbow dysplasia, as well as pain in the hocks and stifles or spinal issues. It is important to rule out other joint and bodily issues before concluding that only hip dysplasia is present. Even if some hip dysplasia is present, {{it is possible for}} other conditions to co-exist or be masked by it.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{conditions}} in dogs may be aggravated by or may show slow or no improvement {{as a result}} of weight bearing exercise. Among these are hip dysplasia and <b>osteochondritis</b> dissecans (OCD), conditions most common in medium to large purebred dogs, such as German Shepherds, Labrador Retrievers or Golden Retrievers; chronic degenerative radiculomyelopathy (CDRM), a degenerative disease of the spinal cord which causes hind limb problems in German Shepherds; and luxating patella which is seen predominantly in small and toy breeds.|$|E
25|$|Caterpillar hair {{can be a}} {{cause of}} human health problems. Caterpillar hairs {{sometimes}} have venoms in them and species from approximately 12 families of moths or butterflies worldwide can inflict serious human injuries ranging from urticarial dermatitis and atopic asthma to <b>osteochondritis,</b> consumption coagulopathy, renal failure, and intracerebral hemorrhage. Skin rashes are the most common, {{but there have been}} fatalities. Lonomia is a frequent cause of envenomation in Brazil, with 354 cases reported between 1989 and 2005. Lethality ranging up to 20% with death caused most often by intracranial hemorrhage.|$|E
25|$|Hip {{arthroscopy}} {{was initially}} {{used for the}} diagnosis of unexplained hip pain, but is now widely used {{in the treatment of}} conditions both in and outside the hip joint. The most common indication currently is for the treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) and its associated pathologies. Hip conditions that may be treated arthroscopically also includes labral tears, loose / foreign body removal, hip washout (for infection) or biopsy, chondral (cartilage) lesions, <b>osteochondritis</b> dissecans, ligamentum teres injuries (and reconstruction), Iliopsoas tendinopathy (or ‘snapping psoas’), trochanteric pain syndrome, snapping iliotibial band, osteoarthritis (controversial), sciatic nerve compression (piriformis syndrome), ischiofemoral impingement and direct assessment of hip replacement.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} {{jumping on the}} hind legs can include {{injuries}} to the proximal, medial, or lateral branches of the suspensory ligaments. Jumping horses can also be at {{a higher risk of}} developing <b>osteochondritis</b> dissecans (OCD) or other arthritic conditions, even at a young age. Genetic and environmental components play roles in the development of OCD in horses: some families have weaker joints, but excessive growth over a short period of time, age-inappropriate exercise regimens and nutrition can also contribute. Jumping performance is especially influenced by the presence of arthropathic hocks. One study found that at breeding stock evaluations, horses with radiographically diagnosed athropathies of the hock joints scored significantly lower than their healthy peers for the quality of the canter, jumping technique, and ability and their character. The pain associated with arthropathic conditions likely makes the horses unwilling to push powerfully off their hindlegs, a quality necessary for jumping and cantering and which could make the horse appear lazy or unwilling to work.|$|E
500|$|<b>Osteochondritis</b> dissecans {{differs from}} [...] "wear and tear" [...] {{degenerative}} arthritis, which is primarily an articular surface problem. Instead, OCD {{is a problem}} of the bone underlying the cartilage, which may secondarily affect the articular cartilage. Left untreated, OCD can lead to the development of degenerative arthritis secondary to joint incongruity and abnormal wear patterns.|$|E
500|$|König {{named the}} disease [...] "osteochondritis dissecans", {{describing}} it as a subchondral inflammatory {{process of the}} knee, resulting in a loose fragment of cartilage from the femoral condyle. In 1922, Kappis described this process in the ankle joint. On review of all literature describing transchondral fractures of the talus, Berndt and Harty developed a classification system for staging of osteochondral lesions of the talus (OLTs). The term <b>osteochondritis</b> dissecans has persisted, and has since been broadened to describe a similar process occurring in many other joints, including the knee, hip, elbow, and metatarsophalangeal joints.|$|E
2500|$|The {{condition}} is most {{commonly found in}} {{children between the ages}} of 4 and 8, but it can occur in {{children between the ages of}} 2 and 15. [...] The main long-term problem with this {{condition is}} that it can produce a permanent deformity of the femoral head, which increases the risk of developing osteoarthritis in adults. [...] It is also commonly known as Perthes disease, or Legg–Perthes disease. Perthes is a form of <b>osteochondritis</b> which only affects the hip, [...] although other forms [...] of <b>osteochondritis</b> can affect elbows, knees, ankles, and feet. [...] Bilateral Perthes, which means both hips are affected, should always be investigated thoroughly to rule out multiple epiphyseal dysplasia.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{diseases}} found less commonly include glaucoma, juvenile cataracts, <b>osteochondritis,</b> hypothyroidism, [...] {{diabetes mellitus}} and canine cyclic neutropaenia, carpal soft-tissue injury. A syndrome of exercise induced collapse {{similar to that}} seen in Labrador Retrievers (otherwise termed Border Collie Collapse) and triggered by episodes of collapse associated with periods of intense exercise has been described in Border Collies in North America, Europe and Australia; and is currently the subject of further investigation.|$|E
2500|$|They {{may suffer}} from heart disease, {{especially}} subvalvular aortic stenosis, and cardiomyopathy and joint diseases, including patella luxation, <b>osteochondritis,</b> panosteitis, and cruciate ligament rupture. In {{addition to the}} heavy shedding they experience (and their constant lighter shedding throughout the year), Golden Retrievers can suffer from skin diseases; the most prevalent skin problem is allergies (often leading to acute moist dermatitis or [...] "hot spots"), with the most common allergy being to fleas. They can also suffer from seborrhoea, sebaceous adenitis, self-inflicted lick granuloma, and haemophilia ...|$|E
2500|$|Rottweilers are a {{relatively}} healthy, disease-free breed. As with most large breeds, hip dysplasia {{can be a}} problem. For this reason the various Rottweiler breed clubs have had x-ray testing regimes in place for many years. <b>Osteochondritis</b> dissecans, a condition affecting the shoulder joints, {{can also be a}} problem due to the breed's rapid growth rate. [...] A reputable breeder will have the hips and elbows of all breeding stock x-rayed and read by a recognised specialist, and will have paperwork to prove it.|$|E
50|$|The other {{recognized}} {{types of}} <b>osteochondritis</b> are <b>osteochondritis</b> deformans juvenilis (<b>osteochondritis</b> of the capitular {{head of the}} epiphysis of the femur) and <b>osteochondritis</b> deformans juvenilis dorsi (osteochondrosis of the spinal vertebrae, also known as Scheuermann's disease).|$|E
50|$|<b>Osteochondritis,</b> and {{especially}} <b>osteochondritis</b> dissecans, can manifest in animals {{as a primary}} cause of elbow dysplasia, a chronic condition in some species and breeds.|$|E

5000|$|The South German Coldblood is {{particularly}} {{susceptible to the}} bone diseases osteochondrosis and <b>osteochondritis</b> dissecans. A study of 167 young horses averaging 14 months old found osteochondritic lesions in the fetlock or hock joints of 61.7% of the sample, and osseous fragments in 28.9%. The incidence in fillies was double that in colts, and symptoms were more often seen in horses {{a year or more}} old. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with <b>osteochondritis</b> dissecans in fetlock joints have been identified.|$|E
