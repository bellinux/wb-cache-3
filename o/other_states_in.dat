5|$|At {{the same}} time, Athens orchestrated the {{creation}} of an alliance with Euboea, Megara, Achaea, Corinth, Acarnania and <b>other</b> <b>states</b> <b>in</b> the Peloponnese. However the most desirable ally for Athens was Thebes. To secure their allegiance, Demosthenes was sent, by Athens, to the Boeotian city; Philip also sent a deputation, but Demosthenes succeeded in securing Thebes's allegiance.* K. Tsatsos, Demosthenes, 284–285; H. Weil, Biography of Demosthenes, 41–42. Demosthenes' oration before the Theban people is not extant and, therefore, the arguments he used to convince the Thebans remain unknown. In any case, the alliance came at a price: Thebes's control of Boeotia was recognised, Thebes was to command solely on land and jointly at sea, and Athens was to pay two thirds of the campaign's cost.|$|E
5|$|For {{more than}} 2,000 years, the Chadian Basin has been {{inhabited}} by agricultural and sedentary people. The region became a crossroads of civilizations. The earliest {{of these were}} the legendary Sao, known from artifacts and oral histories. The Sao fell to the Kanem Empire, the first and longest-lasting of the empires that developed in Chad's Sahelian strip {{by the end of}} the 1st millennium AD. Two <b>other</b> <b>states</b> <b>in</b> the region, Sultanate of Bagirmi and Wadai Empire emerged in the 16th and 17th centuries. The power of Kanem and its successors was based on control of the trans-Saharan trade routes that passed through the region. These states, at least tacitly Muslim, never extended their control to the southern grasslands except to raid for slaves. In Kanem, about a third of the population were slaves.|$|E
5|$|Hancock {{rejoined the}} Continental Congress in Pennsylvania in June 1778, but his brief {{time there was}} unhappy. In his absence, Congress had elected Henry Laurens as its new president, which was a {{disappointment}} to Hancock, who had hoped to reclaim his chair. Hancock got along poorly with Samuel Adams, and missed his wife and newborn son. On July 9, 1778, Hancock and the other Massachusetts delegates joined the representatives from seven <b>other</b> <b>states</b> <b>in</b> signing the Articles of Confederation; the remaining states were not yet prepared to sign, and the Articles would not be ratified until 1781.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} developments in Texan government resulted from the creation of a state oil production tax in 1905.

5|$|Until {{the early}} 1980s, Kerala was a {{relatively}} unknown destination compared to <b>other</b> <b>states</b> <b>in</b> the country. In 1986 the government of Kerala declared tourism an important industry {{and it was the}} first state in India to do so. Marketing campaigns launched by the Kerala Tourism Development Corporation, the government agency that oversees the tourism prospects of the state, resulted in the growth of the tourism industry. Many advertisements branded Kerala with the tagline Kerala, God's Own Country. Kerala tourism is a global brand and regarded as one of the destinations with highest recall. In 2006, Kerala attracted 8.5million tourists, an increase of 23.68% over the previous year, making the state one of the fastest-growing popular destinations in the world. In 2011, tourist inflow to Kerala crossed the 10-million mark.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Helene recurving away from the United States East Coast, damage in the United States outside of the Carolinas was less severe. In Virginia, damage was {{relatively}} minor. A peak gust of 56mph (90km/h) was reported in Norfolk. In Hampton Roads, damage was minor, and was confined to downed utility wires and marginal infrastructural damage. Although rainfall was primarily concentrated in the Carolinas, 1,434official rain gauges measured precipitation in coastal areas from South Carolina to Maine. Precipitation was further increased by a frontal zone to the hurricane's north. In the Mid-Atlantic States, rainfall peaked at 5.29in (134.4mm) in Myerstown, Pennsylvania. Outside of Pennsylvania or the Carolinas, no weather station reported rainfall exceeding 5in (125mm). In the New England region, rainfall peaked at 4.11in (104.4mm) in Hyannis, Massachusetts. Elsewhere in Massachusetts, rainfall totals ranging from 1–4in (25–100mm) caused minor flooding and road washouts. The minor floods led to several automotive accidents. <b>Other</b> <b>states</b> <b>in</b> New England reported rainfall peaks of at least 1in (25mm), with the lowest peak occurring at a weather station in Machias, Maine, which reported 1.16in (29.5mm) of rainfall.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1916, Stevens announced the policy that the CUWS had organized in twenty-two states and planned on recruiting delegates {{for each of the}} 435 House Districts. The delegates were required to form committees to press Congressional Members to favor suffrage and make them aware that their constituents were in favor of women attaining the vote. Another strategy Stevens began implementing early in 1916 required CUWS members to go to <b>other</b> <b>states</b> <b>in</b> which women were allowed to vote, establish residence and register to vote. In this way, they could vote in state and national elections in the hope of filling the legislature with legislators who favored suffrage. Stevens registered to vote in Kansas that year. On 5 June 1916, the CUWS became the National Woman's Party (NWP), having a single platform to acquire a constitutional amendment for national women's suffrage. After attending the NWP convention in Chicago in June, Stevens headed to a convention in Colorado. By October, Stevens was organizing and managing the NWP election campaign in California.|$|E

5|$|The Cold War {{split the}} {{temporary}} wartime alliance against Nazi Germany, leaving the Soviet Union and the United States as two superpowers with profound {{economic and political}} differences. The USSR was a Marxist–Leninist state led by its Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which in turn was dominated by a leader with different titles over time, and a small committee called the Politburo. The Party controlled the press, the military, the economy and many organizations. It also controlled the <b>other</b> <b>states</b> <b>in</b> the Eastern Bloc, and funded Communist parties around the world, sometimes in competition with Communist China, particularly following the Sino-Soviet split of the 1960s. In opposition stood the capitalist West, led by the United States, a federal republic with a two-party presidential system. The First World nations of the Western Bloc were generally democratic with a free press and independent organizations, but were economically and politically entwined with a network of banana republics and other authoritarian regimes throughout the Third World, {{most of which were}} the Western Bloc's former colonies. Some major Cold War frontlines such as Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Congo were still Western colonies in 1947.|$|E
5|$|The Roman/Latin cavalry was {{sufficient}} while Rome was {{in conflict with}} <b>other</b> <b>states</b> <b>in</b> the mountainous Italian peninsula, which also disposed of limited cavalry resources. But as Rome was confronted by external enemies that deployed far more powerful cavalry elements, such as the Gauls and the Carthaginians, the Roman deficiency in cavalry numbers could be a serious liability, which in the Second Punic War (218–202BC) resulted in crushing defeats. Hannibal's major victories at the Trebia and at Cannae, were owed to his Spanish and Gallic heavy cavalry, which far outnumbered the Roman and Latin levies, and to his Numidians, light, fast cavalry which the Romans wholly lacked. The decisive Roman victory at Zama in 202BC, which ended the war, owed much to the Numidian cavalry provided by king Massinissa, which outnumbered the Roman/Latin cavalry fielded by 2 to 1. From then, Roman armies were always accompanied by large numbers of non-Italian cavalry: Numidian light cavalry and, later, Gallic heavy cavalry. For example, Caesar relied heavily on Gallic and German cavalry for his Conquest of Gaul (58–51BC).|$|E
5|$|Unanticipated deaths among recent condor populations {{occurred}} due {{to contact}} with golden eagles, lead poisoning, {{and other factors}} such as power line collisions. Since 1994, captive-bred California condors {{have been trained to}} avoid power lines and people. Since the implementation of this aversion conditioning program, the number of condor deaths due to power lines has greatly decreased. Lead poisoning due to fragmented lead bullets in large game waste is a particularly big problem for condors due to their extremely strong digestive juices; lead waste is not as much of a problem for other avian scavengers such as the turkey vulture and common raven. This problem has been addressed in California by the Ridley-Tree Condor Preservation Act, a bill that went into effect July 1, 2008 that requires that hunters use non-lead bullets when hunting in the condor's range. Blood lead levels in golden eagles as well as turkey vultures has declined with the implementation of the Ridley-Tree Condor Preservation Act, demonstrating that the legislation has helped reduce other species' lead exposures aside from the California condor. There is no comparable anti-lead-bullet legislation in the <b>other</b> <b>states</b> <b>in</b> which the condor currently resides.|$|E
