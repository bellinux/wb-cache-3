Using a data set of standardized annual financial statements of 100 Japanese corporations all listed at the First Section of the Tokyo stock exchange, at the current stage of analysis we find empirical evidence that: (1) investment is determined by output expectations. (2) Q is a significant variable for investment behavior. (3) Investment is restricted by debt-equity ratio, (4) therefore the much claimed signaling effect of a high debt-equity ratio does not hold. (5) In contrast to Germany though, banks allow firms with bank-relationships higher short term debt to total finance and long term loans to total finance ratios, whereas firms with no relationships have a higher equity ratio. (6) Banks influence firms with bank-relationships to decide on low risk investment decisions. Therefore they are able to allow a higher debt-equity ratio (in contrast to Germany). (7) Non-bank-related firms are much more profitable than bank-related firms. The difference is even stronger than in Germany. Yet they also have to bear a higher <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> risk. (8) Apparently the policy of banks in Japan is much different to German banks: Banks force bank-affiliated firms to follow an investment policy, which is much more cautious and therefore leads to less profitability.

The vocabulary of the Germanic languages includes not only the lexicon inherited from Proto‑Indo‑European but a range of languages later on heavily influenced it. In the times before the documentation of the Germanic languages, {{the two most important}} sources that influenced the Germanic lexicon were Celtic and (prolonged) Latin. Influence in the lexicon is found in nearly every part of the daily life vocabulary, ranging from words for food and beverages via commercial products to Christian terminology. These <b>borrowings</b> <b>of</b> words in the most cases took place together with the objects or concepts themselves. The research paradigm that investigates these kinds of correlations between words and the underlying objects or concepts is best summarized under the term ‘Wörter und Sachen’ One of the fields, where (due to e. g. new techniques, materials, temporary fashions) a priori a high <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>borrowings</b> <b>of</b> objects (and concepts) is to be expected, is the lexical field of textiles and the terminology used for textile production. A detailed analysis of the vocabulary used for textiles and the techniques in the older Germanic languages is largely missing.
