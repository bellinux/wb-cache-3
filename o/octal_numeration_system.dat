40|$|One of {{the main}} {{interesting}} concerns in work about <b>numeration</b> <b>systems</b> is studying the relationship that exist between arithmetic properties of numbers and syntactical properties of their representation. More precisely, we prefer to manipulate set of numbers whose representations are characterized by very simple syntactical rules, that is, forming a regular language. Such sets are called S-recognizable sets, where S is the <b>numeration</b> <b>system</b> we are working with. In particular, {{we would like to}} obtain <b>numeration</b> <b>systems</b> in which the whole set N is recognizable, partly due to the fact that, if the set of representations of all integers is regular, there are very simple algorithms making it possible to decide if a word stands or does not stand for a number. Some general questions in this area are the following. • Characterization of the recognizable parts in a fixed <b>numeration</b> <b>system.</b> • Determination of the <b>numeration</b> <b>systems</b> for which a given set of numbers is recognizable. • To examine the stability of recognizability under arithmetic operations.

40|$|We are {{interested}} in the links between numbers and their representations. In the decimal <b>numeration</b> <b>system,</b> a number is even if its representation ends with 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8, which give rise to a simple representation set, that is, accepted by a finite automaton. More generally, in an integer base <b>numeration</b> <b>system,</b> any divisibility criterion is recognized by a finite automaton. The state complexity of a regular language is the number of states of the minimal automaton accepting this language. The syntactic complexity is the size of the associated syntactical monoid.
