5|$|An {{embankment}} dam {{is a massive}} artificial water barrier. It is typically created by the emplacement and compaction of a complex semi-plastic mound of various compositions <b>of</b> <b>soil,</b> sand, clay and/or rock. It has a semi-permanent natural waterproof covering for its surface, and a dense, waterproof core. This makes such a dam impervious to surface or seepage erosion.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} 1950s {{through the late}} 1970s, ant farms were popular {{educational}} children's toys in the United States. Some later commercial versions use transparent gel instead <b>of</b> <b>soil,</b> allowing greater visibility {{at the cost of}} stressing the ants with unnatural light.|$|E
5|$|It also tolerates {{a variety}} <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> conditions. Although young {{specimens}} perform best when planted {{in a mixture}} of peat and either sand or perlite, P.atriplicifolia can thrive in sandy, chalky, or loamy soil, or heavy clay soil with sufficient drainage. It can endure a wide range <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> pH, as well as exposure to salty conditions near oceans. Its deep-feeding taproot makes it especially drought tolerant; for this reason it has seen wide use for xeriscaping in the Intermountain West. Overwatering and over-fertilization can damage its roots and lead to a rapid decline in health. P.atriplicifolia is otherwise generally free from plant pathogens. In cultivation, it is also rarely selected as forage by grazing animals, and so is considered both a deer-resistant and rabbit-resistant plant.|$|E
