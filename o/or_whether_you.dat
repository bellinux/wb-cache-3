500|$|The Governor of Queensland, Sir Colin Hannah, gave {{a speech}} denigrating the Whitlam Government on 15 October, in {{violation}} of the convention that state governors remain neutral. Hannah held a dormant commission as Administrator of the Commonwealth to act as Governor-General in the event of Kerr's death, resignation, or absence from Australia. Whitlam immediately contacted Buckingham Palace to arrange for Hannah's dormant commission to be revoked, a process which took ten days to complete. Although Whitlam later alleged that he never contemplated dismissing Kerr during the crisis, on 16October, while speaking with Kerr and visiting Malaysian Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak, he told Kerr that if the crisis continued, [...] "It could be a question of whether I get to the Queen first for your recall, <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> get in first with my dismissal". Kerr saw the statement as a threat; Whitlam later stated the comment was [...] "flippant" [...] and designed to turn the conversation to another subject.|$|E

Olivia welcomed H.D. to her home, but she witnessed the interactions between Dorothy, Pound, H.D. and Richard Aldington, whom H.D. married in 1913. In September 1912 Olivia wrote a stern letter to Pound, in which she pointedly told him to break off his friendship with Dorothy:You {{told me you were}} prepared to see less of Dorothy this winter. I don't know if you wd rather leave it to me to say I don't think it advisable she should see so much of you etc. <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> wd rather do it in your own way....

She must marry—She & I can't possibly go on living this feminine life practically à deux for ever, & we haven't money enough to separate... You ought to go away—Englishmen don't understand yr American ways, & any man who wanted to marry her wd be put off by the fact of yr friendship (or whatever you call it) with her.

500|$|Smith {{was one of}} {{the loudest}} voices of white dissent against the new constitution. He opposed its {{splitting}} of the heretofore non-racial, qualified electorate into graduated [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B" [...] rolls, saying the proposed system had [...] "racialist" [...] connotations, and objected to the idea that the first black MPs would be elected on what he said would be a [...] "debased franchise". [...] "Our policy in the past has always been that we would have a government, in Rhodesia, based on merit and that people wouldn't worry whether you were black <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> were white," [...] he said. He also pointed out that the document did not actually guarantee Southern Rhodesian independence in the event of Federal dissolution. At the UFP vote on the constitution on 22 February 1961, Smith was the only member out of 280 to vote against it. Deeply disillusioned by these developments, he resigned from the UFP soon after to sit in the Federal Assembly as an independent. He lent his support to the [...] "United Group", an awkward coalition wherein Winston Field's conservative Dominion Party closed ranks with Sir Robert Tredgold and other liberals against the constitutional proposals, despite opposing them for totally contradictory reasons. The black nationalist leaders initially endorsed the constitution, signing the draft document, but almost immediately repudiated it and called for blacks to boycott elections held under it. A referendum of the mostly white electorate approved the new constitution by a majority of 65% on 26 July 1961.|$|E

2500|$|Still embittered by the {{perceived}} betrayal, Paine tried to ruin Washington's reputation by {{calling him a}} treacherous man who was unworthy of his fame as a military and political hero. He sent a stinging letter to Washington, in which he described him as an incompetent commander and a vain and ungrateful person. Paine never received a reply, so he contacted his lifelong publisher, the anti-Federalist Benjamin Bache to publish this Letter to George Washington in 1796. In this scathing publication, Paine wrote: [...] "the world will be puzzled to decide whether you are an apostate or an impostor; whether you have abandoned good principles <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> ever had any." [...] He further wrote that {{without the aid of}} France, Washington could not have succeeded in the Revolution and had [...] "but little share in the glory of the final event." [...] He also commented on Washington's poor character, saying that Washington had no sympathetic feelings and was a hypocrite.|$|E
2500|$|... "Crumbs from Your Table" [...] {{is about}} the {{relationship}} between Western countries and developing countries. The verses and chorus address the relationship from the perspective of citizens from the developing world, focusing on the disparity between the long-term socioeconomic planning stressed by the West ("You speak in signs and wonders") and the developing world's immediate need for sustenance ("But I'm begging for the crumbs from your table"). One line ("You speak in signs and wonders") was meant as a criticism of the Catholic Church. The bridge ("Where you live should not decide / Whether you live <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> die") is statement from Bono that follows with the theme in his speeches in which he tries to raise awareness about African poverty. Bono stated on a bonus DVD included with special editions of the album that the band has no recollection of writing the song, as they were intoxicated at the time. A studio performance is also included on the aforementioned bonus DVD. It was only played a handful on times during the third leg of the Vertigo Tour.|$|E

Horvath remarks, [...] "When he joined the show {{it was the first}} time that someone started talking about peace." [...] She explains, [...] "The arrival of Darius, aside from bringing in a great character, represented the first time that someone questioned the basic premise of the show. The basic premise is that 's a hero and he goes around kicking the ass of the bad guys. Now you have this character in Darius who shows up and says, 'Yes, but is it actually a good goal to kick the ass of the bad guys?' Even though Mac has to be a good guy who has to fight the bad guys, you set up this scenario where one of his closest friends has questioned whether beating up bad guys makes you a good guy <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> should be a man of peace. (...) That underlying question shaped the whole rest of the series." [...] Abramowitz says further, [...] "It was a major moment for MacLeod. And {{it was the first time}} for him when he believed that the way of the warrior may not be the only way."

2500|$|To such statements, Protestants such as Jordan {{point out}} that Christians will, in fact, choose against the blessing of money and great wealth. Jordan also {{maintains}} that, while children are indeed blessings, they are only one among {{a wide range of}} blessings God offers, and prayerfully choosing foci among them is part of prudent Christian stewardship. John Piper's Desiring God ministry further explains,Scriptures also say that a wife is a gift from the Lord (Proverbs 18:22), but that doesn't mean that it is wrong to stay single (1 Corinthians 7:8). Just because something is a gift from the Lord does not mean that it is wrong to be a steward of when <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> will come into possession of it. It is wrong to reason that since A is good and a gift from the Lord, then we must pursue as much of A as possible. God has made this a world in which tradeoffs have to be made and we cannot do everything to the fullest extent. For kingdom purposes, it might be wise not to get married. And for kingdom purposes, it might be wise to regulate the size of one's family and to regulate when the new additions to the family will likely arrive. As Wayne Grudem has said, [...] "it is okay to place less emphasis on some good activities in order to focus on other good activities." ...|$|E
2500|$|Typical scripts for {{an average}} one-hour {{television}} show run 60 pages, but those for Moonlighting were nearly twice as long due to the fast talking overlapping dialogue of the main characters. While the average television show would take seven days to shoot, Moonlighting would take from 12–14 days to complete with episodes and dialogue frequently being written by Caron the same day they were shot. This attention to detail contributed to Moonlighting as {{being one of the}} most expensive television shows being produced at the time. Where most episodes would cost around $900,000 to produce, Moonlighting was running nearly double that. [...] The season 2 episode [...] "The Dream Sequence Always Rings Twice" [...] could have been filmed much more cheaply by being shot in color and then decolorized, but Caron insisted on the authentic look of black-and-white film which took 16 days to shoot, bringing the cost of the episode to the then-unheard-of sum of two million dollars. Caron often defended his filming practices in the name of giving the audience what they wanted and producing a quality product. He used the following analogy to illustrate the point, [...] "The thinking in television which makes no damn sense to me, is that a half hour of television costs X, and an hour of television costs Y, no matter what that television is, it strikes me as an insane hypothesis. The parallel is, you're hungry, whether you go to McDonald's <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> go to '21,' it should cost the same; they both fill your stomach. It's nonsense." ...|$|E

Some Jewish members resigned following claims of an underlying institutional anti-Semitism. In 2010, the UCU passed a boycott motion that invoked a [...] "call from the Palestinian Boycott National Committee" [...] for [...] "an isolation of Israel while it continues to act in breach of international law" [...] and calls to [...] "campaign actively" [...] against Israel's trade agreement with the European Union. Susan Fuhrman, President of Teachers College, Columbia University said: [...] "As the president of an academic institution dedicated {{in large part to}} the preparation of teachers, I believe that universities and all centers of learning must be allowed to function as safe havens for freedom of discussion, debate and intellectual inquiry, standing apart from national and international politics and partisan strife. Only thus can they continue to produce scholarship that informs the policies and laws of democratic societies and stand as islands of hope in a frequently polarized world.... Teachers College welcomes dialogue with Israeli scholars and universities and stands with Columbia University President Lee Bollinger in expressing solidarity with them by inviting UCU to boycott us, as well." [...] Jeremy Newmark of the Jewish Leadership Council and joint head of Stop the Boycott, sharply criticized the boycott proposal, stating that: [...] "Whether you are a trade unionist wanting a powerful union <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> are a long-standing campaigner for peace, it is clear that the UCU has taken leave of its senses." ...|$|E

2500|$|She {{released}} a second book in 2003, titled Sacred Evil: Encounters with the Unknown. The book, which was previously known as Good and Evil, chronicled nine case studies during {{her life as}} a Wiccan healer and gives explanations as to why those events happened. To promote the book, Chakraverti held a healing session at Oxford Bookstore in Kolkata, where she read excerpts from the book, and gave demonstration of her healing skills, holding the hand of a volunteer, tapping her with her athame (wand) and reciting Egyptian chants. After its release, the book received positive reaction from critics. Rajdeep Bains from The Tribune commented [...] "Sacred Evil is a very coherent account of the author’s dealings with witchcraft and sorcery. Unfortunately, it could add to superstition, which is already prevalent at an unhealthy level in our country. As a work of fiction it would have been laudable; given the cover of truth it becomes a dangerous piece of writing. [...] But what makes Sacred Evil so interesting is the juxtaposition of modern thought with the ageless. After every chapter there are notes on the practices described in it along with modern explanations." [...] Krithika Ranjan from The Hindu commented, [...] "Throughout [...] Chakraverti refers to herself as a skeptic. Yet the stories she tells are bound to raise the ire of [...] rationalists. You can almost hear one spluttering about superstition as you read the story Those who return. [...] In the final analysis, the book is a good read— whether you believe in the dark arts <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> just want to curl up with a spine chiller."
