The concert film premiered exclusively on ABC on November 25, 2010 as a 90-minute Thanksgiving special. A year before, over Thanksgiving itself, the network aired , {{shot at the}} Encore Theater, Las Vegas, on August 2, 2009. Several other trailers kept dropping on Beyoncé' official website in November. Beyoncé made an appearance at the School of Visual Arts Theater in New York City's Chelsea neighborhood on November 21, 2010 to premiere the concert film. On November 22, 2010, she held a screening of the DVD in New York, in presence of her parents and artists such as Mary J. Blige, Jennifer Hudson, Amel Larrieux, Tyson Beckford, Alicia Keys, and AJ Calloway. Additionally, {{in an interview with}} the Associated Press on the same day, Beyoncé revealed that the DVD will show more of her intimate side, stating: [...] "I felt like I've done so many different things, it's time for me to show a bit of who I am. The hardest thing was showing that, because a lot <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> filmed, I filmed in my computer, and I would never have gotten so open if someone else was in the room." [...] On November 23, 2010, Beyoncé was interviewed by Cynthia McFadden on ABC's Nightline where she stated [...] "I feel like I wanted the fans to be able to see the things that I see... It's a lot <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> reveal about myself that I would never give to another director." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2011, Horsfield {{stepped down}} as {{assistant}} manager to concentrate on his coaching qualifications, remaining at Port Vale as a coach. Later in the month he scored in a friendly against Stone Dominoes, but dismissed speculation {{that he would make}} a return to the playing side of the game. In December 2011, loan striker Guy Madjo celebrated his first goal for the club by running over to Horsfield on the touchline, [...] "to say thank you for all the finishing (practice) that we have been doing. He has shown me a lot <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> haven't done in the past. In seven years, I have been so many places, to so many clubs and I haven't done that with anyone else, so I just feel it was a good dedication for him." [...] Horsfield retired completely from football in May 2012 to pursue business interests.|$|E
6000|$|... "Much or little, {{it made no}} {{difference}} with me. I should never have thought of marrying a girl for her money. It's a kind <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> hate. I almost wish she was to have nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You know, Fyne," [...] I said, [...] "a man in jail {{seems to}} me such an incredible, cruel, nightmarish sort <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can hardly believe in his existence. Certainly not in {{relation}} to any other existences." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose I must thank you, Delafield, for {{the pretty}} {{compliment}} {{you have just}} paid me, but I am so unused to this sort <b>of</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> really feel as bashful as sweet fifteen, though I am at mature twenty." ...|$|R
500|$|In a 1988 {{interview}} with Barbara Walters, Fonda expressed regret {{for some of}} her comments and actions, stating:I {{would like to say}} something, not just to Vietnam veterans in New England, but to men who were in Vietnam, who I hurt, or whose pain I caused to deepen because <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> said or did. I was trying to help end the killing and the war, but there were times when I was thoughtless and careless about it and I'm very sorry that I hurt them. And I want to apologize to them and their families. [...] I will go to my grave regretting the photograph of me in an anti-aircraft gun, which looks like I was trying to shoot at American planes. It hurt so many soldiers. It galvanized such hostility. It was the most horrible thing I could possibly have done. It was just thoughtless.|$|E
500|$|... 1602, Nick Lowe and Joe Quesada, {{approached}} Gaiman after Quesada became Marvel's Editor in Chief {{with the}} intent for Gaiman {{to work on a}} project for Marvel. Gaiman eventually agreed to write a Marvel comic in August 2001, although he was not sure what it would contain. When the September 11, 2001 attacks occurred, Gaiman decided {{that he did not want}} planes, skyscrapers, bombs or guns in his comic. [...] "I didn't want it to be a war story, and I didn't want to write a story in which might made right – or in which might made anything." [...] On a trip to Venice soon after, Gaiman was struck by how the [...] "past seemed very close at hand"; he returned from the trip knowing the story he wanted to tell. The time was chosen because [...] "it was a nice place to set the story. It gave me America and it gave me a lot <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wanted in terms of the way the world was changing. It also gave me the sense of wonder and magic." ...|$|E
500|$|Writer Kinberg {{would later}} state that [...] "there {{are a lot}} of things about 'X3' that I love and there are a lot <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> regret", {{detailing}} that he would have preferred the Dark Phoenix as the main plotline and [...] "I would have fought harder" [...] for that, considering that at the period [...] "the darkness of her story was a little bit daunting on a huge $200 million studio movie" [...] leading Fox to ask for rewrites. Previous X-Men director Bryan Singer declared that The Last Stand [...] "isn't what I would have done" [...] and he was dissatisfied with the busy plot and excessive character deaths, but Singer still liked some parts of the movie, such as Ellen Page's casting – leading Singer to bring her back as Kitty Pryde in [...] – and the scenes with Leech, which he described as [...] "really sweet moments". Matthew Vaughn, who was attached as director before dropping out, criticized Ratner's direction: [...] "I could have done something with far more emotion and heart. I'm probably going to be told off for saying that, but I genuinely believe it." [...] While promoting his own installment of the franchise, 2011's , Vaughn would say regarding The Last Stand that [...] "I storyboarded the whole bloody film, did the script. My X3 would have been 40 minutes longer. They didn't let the emotions and the drama play in that film. It became wall-to-wall noise and drama. I would have let it breathe and given far more dramatic elements to it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Here is {{the sort}} <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> invite the {{intelligent}} reader to link up if he can with the very natural phenomenon {{of a number of}} quite ordinary sensible people hostile and in retreat before a tedious, perplexing, and presumptuous discourse-- ...|$|R
6000|$|He muttered something, {{and walked}} {{across the room and}} back. [...] "I am quite clear on one point at least," [...] he said.

2500|$|As {{far back}} as his time at Wadham College, Fry had been {{interested}} in politics, but admitted: [...] "I take {{a great interest in}} heaps <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> know nothing about... politics for one".|$|E
2500|$|According to a 2006 Newsweek interview, [...] "For Graham, {{politics}} is a secondary to the Gospel.... When Newsweek asked Graham whether ministers—whether they {{think of themselves as}} evangelists, pastors or a bit of both—should spend time engaged with politics, he replied: 'You know, I think in a way that has to be up to the individual as he feels led of the Lord. A lot <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> commented on years ago would not have been of the Lord, I'm sure, but I think you have some—like communism, or segregation, on which I think you have a responsibility to speak out.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{with all}} emotions, saudade {{has been an}} {{inspiration}} for many songs and compositions. [...] "Sodade" [...] (saudade in Cape Verdean Creole) is {{the title of the}} Cape Verde singer Cesária Évora's most famous song. Étienne Daho, a French singer, also produced a song of the same name. The Good Son, a 1990 album by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, was heavily informed by Cave's mental state at the time, which he has described as saudade. He told journalist Chris Bohn: [...] "When I explained to someone that what I wanted to write about was the memory <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> thought were lost for me, I was told that the Portuguese word for this feeling was saudade. It's not nostalgia but something sadder." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I really don't {{like this}} thing," [...] says Mrs. G.; [...] "it's not a kind <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> approve <b>of,</b> and if Mrs. X. {{was not going}} to let her daughters go, I should set myself against it. How Mrs. X., who is so very nice in her notions, can {{sanction}} such a thing, I cannot see. I am really surprised at Mrs. X." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not a word,' resumed Squeers, 'and {{never will}} be. Now, {{this is a}} pretty sort <b>of</b> <b>thing,</b> isn't it, <b>that</b> you should have been left here, all these years, and no money paid after the first six--nor no notice taken, nor no clue to be got who you belong to? It's a pretty sort <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should have to feed a great fellow like you, and never hope to get one penny for it, isn't it?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very pretty," [...] said Lothair; [...] "but it is {{not exactly}} this sort <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> want. See," [...] and he opened the dispatch-box, and took from out of it a crucifix. It was made of some Eastern wood, inlaid with mother-of-pearl; the figure carved in brass, though not without power, {{and at the end}} of each of the four {{terminations}} of the cross was a small cavity, enclosing something, and covered with glass.|$|R
2500|$|On {{his next}} single, [...] "The Fightin' Side of Me," [...] {{released}} by his record company in 1970 over Haggard's objections, Haggard's lyrics {{stated that he}} did not mind the counterculture [...] "switchin' sides and standin' up for what they believe in," [...] but resolutely declared, [...] "If you don't love it, leave it!" [...] In May 1970, Haggard explained to John Grissom of Rolling Stone, [...] "I don't like their views on life, their filth, their visible self-disrespect, y'know. They don't give a shit what they look like or what they smell like.... What do they have to offer humanity?" [...] In a 2003 interview with No Depression magazine, Haggard said, [...] "I had different views in the '70s. As a human being, I've learned [...] I have more culture now. I was dumb as a rock when I wrote 'Okie From Muskogee.' That's being honest with you at the moment, and a lot <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> said [...] I sing with a different intention now. My views on marijuana have totally changed. I think we were brainwashed and I think anybody that doesn't know that needs to get up and read and look around, get their own information. It's a cooperative government project to make us think marijuana should be outlawed." ...|$|E
60|$|C. I don't know. That is, I don't {{know the}} process, but I DO know lots <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't {{remember}}, and remember lots <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't know. It's so with every educated person.|$|E

60|$|Such {{are some}} <b>of</b> the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{remember}} about this journey, but to tell truth I {{paid little attention}} to them and many others.|$|R

5000|$|Regarding his {{decision}} {{to shut down the}} landfill despite the fact the landfill was owned by a relative, Blagojevich said, [...] "This is the kind <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> think frankly separates the men from the boys in leadership. Do you have the testicular virility to make a decision like that knowing what's coming your way? I say I do." [...] This remark was both ridiculed as an undignified comment for a governor as well as criticized for being sexist.|$|R
6000|$|... "Better! Yes, I'll {{take her}} to Philadelphia, and perhaps to Baltimore. There's the gardens, and the theatres, and the museums, and lots <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> dare say the dear old soul never laid eyes on." ...|$|E

5000|$|After {{initially}} claiming {{credit for}} the appropriation, Burns subsequently denied knowledge of it. [...] "A lot <b>of</b> <b>things</b> happened <b>that</b> <b>I</b> didn't know about. It shouldn't have happened, but it did." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Papa," [...] said Busy Bee, [...] "I {{am afraid}} I know the reason but too well.

6000|$|The poor King {{looked puzzled}} and unhappy, and {{struggled}} with the pencil for some time without saying anything; but Alice was too strong for him, and at last he panted out, 'My dear!

60|$|I had not {{expected}} this extraordinary docility.
