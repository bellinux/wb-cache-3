The process entails submitting an <b>order</b> <b>form</b> every summer, applicants are usually successful after about ten years. Failure to make an application every year results in being placed {{at the back of the}} queue. Although some tickets are allocated by lottery, preference is given to members of the Society of Friends of Bayreuth (financial donors), famous patrons, and to regional and international Wagner societies, which are distributed to their own members through lottery or the willingness to pay a high contribution.|$|E
25|$|Roth's work became {{increasingly}} varied throughout the 1970s. He exhibited manufacturing instructions - the <b>Order</b> <b>Form</b> Exhibitions - {{for the first}} show, any buyer could take the directions to a printer of their choice, and create their own print or multiple; second time around, the instructions {{had to be taken}} to a baker to create the collector's own baked goods. The same attitude applied to collectors; his most important collector, the German dentist Hanns Sohm, made his own Literature Sausages to Roth's instructions, including Georg Wilhelm Friedrih Hegel’s Work in 20 Volumes. He published the magazine Zeitschrift für Alles (Review for Everything) 1975–1987, promised to publish anything that anyone sent to Roth, the only editorial constraint being the limit of 4 (later 5) pages. By the time Roth announced its demise, the journal had grown to 1396 pages long. The mid seventies also saw a comprehensive attempt to republish all of Roth's bookworks. Instigated by Hansjörg Mayer, a publisher Roth had met in 1963, the Gesammelte Werke (Collected Works) would run to 26 volumes, many of which are still easily available across Europe and America.|$|E

Matrix order fractional calculus is used to define matrix <b>order</b> <b>forms.</b> This is achieved by combining matrix order derivatives with exterior derivatives. Coordinate transformation rules and covariant derivative for matrix <b>order</b> <b>forms</b> are also produced.

Beginning with the seminal work of Katriel [Lett.

In this paper, we apply the linear representation of noncrossing partitions to contractions of normally <b>ordered</b> <b>forms.</b> In this way, we define the notion of noncrossing normal ordering. This appear to be a natural mathematical concept and it results indeed to be linked with well-known combinatorial objects. We explicitely give the noncrossing normally <b>ordered</b> <b>form</b> of the functions (a r (a †) s) n) and (a r + (a †) s) n, plus various special cases. We establish bijections between noncrossing contractions of these functions, k-ary trees and sets of lattice paths. Physical applications of the noncrossing normal ordering are desiderata.

Duntov knew customers would continue to race Corvettes even though the ban, which initially had full support from GM management, was in effect. During the planning of the Sting Ray project, Duntov suggested {{that it would be a}} good idea to continue with parts development in order to benefit racers, and as a way of surreptitiously circumventing the racing ban. Eventually, when GM management relented from their support of the ban, Duntov and his colleagues created [...] "RPO Z06" [...] as a special performance equipment package for the Corvette. The Regular Production Option (RPO) was a GM internal ordering code designation. The package was specifically designed for competition-minded buyers, so they could order a race-ready Corvette straight from the factory with just one check of an option box.

A few months prior to the conference all the monks are notified about the dates and are asked to suggest subjects for discussion and to send Resolutions to be taken up for discussion. The Agenda is finalized based on the suggestions received. On the first day of the Conference, [...] The General Secretary on behalf of all elected Trustees, places the report of all the activities that had taken place in the Organisation, during the years that had gone by since they met last. The accounts are then placed before the Conference by the monk in-charge of accounts. The Conference passes the accounts and discusses the Report of activities. The Minutes of the earlier Conference too is passed. The monks also condole the deaths that had occurred in their ranks in the years between successive Conferences. The proposals of monks are voted upon if necessary.|$|E

40|$|Medication {{errors are}} {{the most common cause of}} {{iatrogenic}} adverse events. They can lead to severe complications, including prolonged hospitalization, unnecessary diagnostic tests and treatments, and even death. Objective:We set to explore the impact of introducing standardized cath lab <b>order</b> <b>forms</b> on medication errors, quality of patient care and staff satisfaction. This was a single center observational study conducted in a tertiary cardiac center in Saudi Arabia. We enrolled a total of 100 consecutive patients who underwent diagnostic or interventional cardiac catheterization before or after the introduction of standardized <b>order</b> <b>forms.</b> The cohort was divided into two equal groups. We compared medication prescription errors (as defined by hospital formulary) between the two groups. We also studies the impact of the standardized <b>order</b> <b>forms</b> on peri-procedural care including laboratory tests order completion, peri-procedural fluid and diabetes management, anticoagulant, diuretic and analgesia management. We have also employed a structured questionnaire to assess staff satisfaction with the use of these forms implementation of standardized <b>order</b> <b>forms</b> resulted in significant reduction of prescription errors from 32. 0 % to 0. 0 % (p =  0. 025). There was also a significant improvement in patient care as indicated by improvement in the rates of completion of laboratory orders that improved from 76. 0 % to 96. 0 % after the implementation of <b>order</b> <b>forms</b> (p =  0. 004), proper fluid management (100 % vs. 86. 0 %, p =  0. 023) and better peri-procedural diabetic management (see attached table). There was also improvement in the monitoring of the vascular access site (80 % vs. 100 %, p =  0. 004) that resulted in reduction in access site related complications (6 % vs. 0 %). We administered a satisfaction questionnaire to 61 participants (nurses, physicians and pharmacists). The mean total satisfaction score was 62. 8 for pharmacists, 50. 4 for nurses and 48. 6 for physicians indicating that the pharmacists were most satisfied with the implementation of these <b>order</b> <b>forms</b> and the physicians were the least satisfied (p =  0. 052).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: e the {{historical}} development {{and status of}} a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) policy on acute geriatric wards in Flanders, Belgium, and to compare it with the international situation. DESIGN: ed mail questionnaires. SETTING: All 94 acute geriatric wards in hospitals in Flanders in 2002 (the year Belgium voted a law on euthanasia). PARTICIPANTS: Head geriatricians. MEASUREMENTS: A questionnaire was mailed about the existence, development, {{and implementation of the}} DNR policy (guidelines and <b>order</b> <b>forms),</b> with a request to return copies of existing DNR guidelines and DNR <b>order</b> <b>forms.</b> RESULTS: The response was 76. 6 %, with hospital characteristics not significantly different for responders and nonresponders. Development of DNR policy began in 1985, with a step-up in 1997 and 2001. In 2002, a DNR policy was available in 86. 1 % of geriatric wards, predominantly with institutional DNR guidelines and individual, patient-specific DNR <b>order</b> <b>forms.</b> Geriatric wards in private hospitals implemented their policy later (P=. 01) and more often had <b>order</b> <b>forms</b> (P=. 04) than those in public hospitals. The policy was initiated and developed predominantly from an institutional perspective by the hospital. The forms were not standardized and generally lacked room to document patient involvement in the decision making process. CONCLUSION: Implementation of institutional DNR guidelines and individual DNR <b>order</b> <b>forms</b> on geriatric wards in Flanders lagged behind that of other countries and was still incomplete in 2002. DNR policies varied in content and scope and were predominantly an expression of institutional defensive attitudes rather than a tool to promote patient involvement in DNR and other end-of-life decision...|$|R
