About 20% of people do well and a few recover completely. Social problems, such as long-term unemployment, poverty and homelessness are common. The average life expectancy of people with the disorder is ten to twenty-five years less than for the general population.

Snowfall is above normal across the Pacific Northwest and western Great Lakes.

40|$|The {{realized}} and intrinsic rates <b>of</b> <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> several meiobenthic {{populations are}} compared.

There is also a remarkable agreement between the values of the predator Protohydra leuckarti and its principal prey Tachidius discipes. The intrinsic rates <b>of</b> natural <b>increase</b> vary more, but are a linear function of temperature in all species investigated.
