5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on April 22, 1910. The production was a split reel, containing both Her Battle for Existence and Sand Man's Cure, with an estimated length of 1000 feet. The American Film Institute refers more specifically to the entire reel being 998 feet in length, but does not distinguish between the lengths of the productions. A Thanhouser Filmography Analysis, provided by Thanhouser Company Film Preservation, lists the film as comprising {{three quarters of a}} reel - approximately 750 feet. The reasoning is not provided, but the previous release and the next to follow were split reels <b>of</b> <b>similar</b> <b>lengths.</b> Billboard would not identify the film as a split release or give the length for this and the other Thanhouser split reel that followed.|$|E
25|$|American {{crocodiles}} in the United States {{coexist with}} the American alligator, and are primarily found {{south of the}} latitude of Miami, in Everglades National Park, Florida Bay, Biscayne Bay, and the Florida Keys. A sizable population occurs near Homestead, Florida, at the Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station. Some individuals wander northward to warm summer waters and have been sighted in Sarasota County and Palm Beach County. In the summer of 2008, a crocodile was captured in the surf on Isle of Palms, South Carolina. In 2013, a 700-pound crocodile was captured in Tarpon Springs, Florida. Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission program staff note that the crocodile was not weighed to be 700 lbs. The weight was estimated by the nuisance alligator trapper who inadvertently caught the animal using a baited hook.

50|$|The {{bullhead}} {{has a large}} broad {{head and}} tapering body, large fins and a rounded tail. The eyes are located {{near the top of}} the head. To the distinction from the other freshwater sculpin species found in Northern Europe, it can be told from the alpine bullhead Cottus poecilopus by the fact that the rays of its pelvic fins are <b>of</b> <b>similar</b> <b>lengths</b> while the first and last rays are longer in the alpine bullhead. It can be distinguished from the fourhorn sculpin by the fact that the dorsal and anal fins terminate close to the tail giving a short caudal peduncle. When it rests on the bottom, the pectoral fins flare out resembling wings. The bullhead is usually about 6 to 8 cm long and is light brown mottled with darker colour. The pelvic fins are colourless and lack the stripes of the alpine bullhead.|$|E

The tunnel is equipped with variable traffic signs in order to ensure enhanced traffic safety of the traffic, regulated from traffic control centres along the A1 motorway. Electronic equipment allows use of two VHF radio frequencies (HR1 at 102.3 MHz and HR2 at 97.5 MHz) as well as cell phones. Electrical power is supplied to the tunnel via one 35 kV switching station {{at each end of the}} tunnel and 8 distribution switching stations in the tunnel itself. A backup electrical power supply is also provided to ensure continuous operation of the tunnel.|$|E

5000|$|Designed by the 1959 and 1962 Indy 500 winner Roger Ward, Pocono Raceway has {{a unique}} design. Each turn is modeled after turns at 3 {{different}} tracks. Turn One (14 degree banking) was modeled after the now defunct Trenton Speedway, Turn Two (also known as [...] "The Tunnel Turn") is like Indianapolis Motor Speedway (9 degree banking), and Turn 3 (6 degree banking) is similar to The Milwaukee Mile. It {{could be said to}} be a tri-oval, but the turns are much more severe than those of a more typical tri-oval such as Daytona and the track is really nearly a triangle. They have been likened somewhat to the hairpin-style turns of road courses. An additional complication is that the three turns are not identical, nor are any of the three straights identical in length. The banking of each turn is considerably less than on many other long ovals. Although the track is long (2.5 miles), the sharp nature of the turns and low banking tends to make the overall speeds much lower than at other tracks <b>of</b> <b>similar</b> <b>lengths,</b> thus restrictor plates are not needed here. For its unique characteristics, Pocono is sometimes referred to as a roval (an oval track that behaves like a road course). Others refer to Pocono as a modified road course due to the use of shifting gears to handle the range between the slowest curve and the fastest straightaway.|$|E

Necklaces <b>of</b> <b>similar</b> <b>lengths</b> would normally be worn in the Roman period with a pendant, but no pendants {{were found in the}} hoard. The three rings were originally set with gems, which might have been natural gemstones, or pieces of coloured glass; however, these were taken from the rings before they were buried, perhaps for reuse. The rings are of similar design, one with an oval bezel, one with a circular bezel, and one with a large oblong bezel.The 19 bracelets buried in the hoard include three sets of four matching gold bracelets. Though many similar bracelets have survived, sets of four are most unusual; they may have been worn two on each arm, or possibly were shared by two related women. One set has been decorated by corrugating the gold with lateral and transverse grooves; the other two sets bear pierced-work geometric designs. Another five bracelets bear hunting scenes, common in Late Roman decorative art. Three have the designs executed in pierced-work, whereas two others are in repoussé. One bracelet is the sole gold item in the hoard to carry an inscription: it reads [...] "" [...] in Latin, meaning [...] "Use [...] happily, Lady Juliane". The expression utere felix (or sometimes uti felix) is the second most common inscriptional formula on items from Roman Britain, and is used to wish good luck, well-being and joy. The formula is not specifically Christian, but it sometimes occurs in an explicitly Christian context, for example, together with a Chi-Rho symbol.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the inner crust structure of neutron stars using the Skyrme-Hartree-Fock approach with the Coulomb interaction treated beyond the Wigner-Seitz approximation.

Namely, we show that the relative energies of different phases are rapidly oscillating functions of the neutron density.
