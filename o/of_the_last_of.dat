5|$|Following its announcement, The Last of Us: Left Behind {{was highly}} {{anticipated}} {{due to the}} critical success <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Last</b> <b>of</b> Us. It was acclaimed by many reviewers, with praise particularly directed at its story, characterization, and depiction of female and LGBT characters. It won several year-end accolades from multiple gaming publications.|$|E
5|$|Naughty Dog began {{developing}} The Last of Us: Left Behind {{following the}} release <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Last</b> <b>of</b> Us in June 2013, {{with a team}} about half the size. Following the decision to create single-player downloadable content for the game, the development team immediately decided that the story would focus {{on the character of}} Ellie; they found that players <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Last</b> <b>of</b> Us were interested to learn about events in Ellie's life prior to the events of the main game, particularly the events involving Riley Abel, whom Ellie mentioned in The Last of Us. In addition, they found that some players were interested in the events that occurred between the Fall and Winter segments of the main game, in which Ellie cares for an injured Joel. This led to the team deciding to contrast these two events against each other, feeling it would help the story's pacing. Game director Bruce Straley said that the team felt the story justified the development of Left Behind.|$|E

5|$|Alboin's {{death had}} a lasting impact, as it {{deprived}} the Lombards {{of the only}} leader they had that could have kept together the newborn Germanic entity. His end also represents the death <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>of</b> {{the line of the}} hero-kings that had led the Lombards through their migrations from the Elba to Italy. His fame survived him for many centuries in epic poetry, with Saxons and Bavarians celebrating his prowess in battle, his heroism, and the magical properties of his weapons.|$|E
5|$|As Preneuse {{had gone}} ashore near Port Louis, Sercey {{had come to}} observe the {{engagement}} and therefore witnessed the destruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>of</b> his squadron of 1796. A commander without a command he subsequently took ship back to France and there retired from his commission, later returning {{to his family and}} settling on Île de France. The action temporarily left the French with no naval forces in the East Indies at all, although raiding cruises by privateers still posed a considerable threat to the British Indian Ocean trade routes. The only subsequent reinforcement to arrive in the region during the war was the frigate Chiffone was intercepted and captured at the Battle of Mahé shortly after arrival in 1801, although substantial reinforcements did reach Île de France before the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars in 1803.|$|E
5|$|As {{a student}} at Carnegie Mellon University in 2004, Druckmann was tasked with {{creating}} a video game concept to present to film director George A. Romero, who would select a winner. Druckmann's idea was to merge the gameplay of Ico (2001) in a story set during a zombie apocalypse, like that of Romero's Night of the Living Dead (1968), with a lead character similar to John Hartigan from Sin City (1991–2000). The lead character, a police officer, would be tasked with protecting a young girl; however, due to the lead character's heart condition, players would often assume control of the young girl, reversing the roles. Though the idea did not win, Druckmann later developed it when creating the story <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Last</b> <b>of</b> Us. An early idea for the game was that the infection only spread to women, though this was later deemed misogynistic.|$|E

5|$|Edward's preferment of {{the former}} Lancastrian-supporting Woodville family, {{following}} his marriage to Elizabeth Woodville, led Warwick and Clarence to help Margaret depose Edward and return Henry to the throne. Edward and Richard, Duke of Gloucester, fled, but on their return, Clarence switched sides at the Battle of Barnet, leading {{to the death of}} the Neville brothers. The subsequent Battle of Tewkesbury brought the demise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>of</b> the male line of the Beauforts. The battlefield execution of Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales, and the later probable murder of Henry VI extinguished the House of Lancaster.|$|E
5|$|Ellie {{was created}} by Neil Druckmann, the {{creative}} director and writer <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Last</b> <b>of</b> Us. Inspired by a mute character proposed for , Druckmann created her as a strong female character with {{a close relationship with}} Joel; throughout the game's development, the relationship between Ellie and Joel was the central focus, with all other elements developed around it. Johnson inspired aspects of Ellie's personality, prompting Druckmann to make her more active in fighting hostile enemies. Naughty Dog also redesigned her appearance during the game's development to more closely resemble Johnson. Her appearance has also been compared to that of actress Ellen Page.|$|E
5|$|Framingham Railroad Station is a {{historic}} Boston and Albany Railroad station located in downtown Framingham, Massachusetts. Designed by noted American architect H. H.

The station, built in 1884–85, served as a major stop on the B Main Line {{as well as a}} hub for branch lines to Milford, Mansfield, Fitchburg, and Lowell. After years of deterioration, the station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975, and restored a decade later.|$|E

5|$|In March 2014, Sony {{announced}} that Druckmann {{was writing a}} film adaptation <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Last</b> <b>of</b> Us, produced by Sam Raimi and distributed by Screen Gems. By January 2015, Druckmann had written the script's second draft, and performed a read-through with some actors. Very little work occurred following this, as Druckmann stated in April 2016 that the film had entered development hell. Druckmann is currently co-writing a sequel to the first game, titled The Last of Us Part II, alongside Halley Gross; Straley will not return to co-direct the game. In August 2017, Druckmann was featured as a guest judge on an episode of Face Off.|$|E
5|$|Joel (Troy Baker) is {{the protagonist}} <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Last</b> <b>of</b> Us. Originally from Texas, Joel {{was a single}} father in his late 20s when the initial Cordyceps {{outbreak}} occurred. Fleeing with his brother Tommy and his twelve-year-old daughter Sarah, they got involved in a firefight with a soldier, and Sarah was mortally wounded and died in his arms, leaving him traumatized. In the 20 years that follow, Joel did whatever {{he had to do}} to survive. In the time spent in the brutal post-apocalyptic world, still bitter from his daughter's death, Joel became a hardened survivor, physically and mentally tough. He has a brutal fighting style and is capable of taking on and defeating much younger men in hand-to-hand combat.|$|E
5|$|On March 6, 2014, Sony {{announced}} that Screen Gems will distribute a film adaptation <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Last</b> <b>of</b> Us, written by Druckmann and produced by Sam Raimi.

40|$|Purpose: <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this study}} was to {{determine}} <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> horizontal and vertical velocities at <b>the</b> landing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> step <b>of</b> approach run on the performance and optimal phase ratio <b>of</b> <b>the</b> triple jump. Methods: Three-dimensional kinematic data of 13 elite male triple jumpers were obtained during a competition. Computer simulations were performed using a biomechanical model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> triple jump to determine the longest actual distance using the optimal phase ratio with altered horizontal and vertical velocities at <b>the</b> landing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> step <b>of</b> approach run. Results: The actual distance obtained using the optimal phase ratio significantly increased as the horizontal velocity at <b>the</b> landing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> step <b>of</b> approach run increased (p[*]=[*] 0. 001) and the corresponding downward vertical velocity decreased (p[*]=[*] 0. 001). Increasing horizontal velocity at <b>the</b> landing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> step <b>of</b> approach run decreased optimal hop percentage and increased optimal jump percentage (p[*]=[*] 0. 001), while decreasing corresponding downward vertical velocity increased optimal hop percentage and decreased optimal jump percentage (p[*]=[*] 0. 001). Conclusion: <b>The</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> velocities at <b>the</b> landing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> step <b>of</b> approach run on the optimal phase ratio were generally small and did not qualitatively alter optimal techniques...|$|R

5|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>of</b> these migrations {{to arrive}} in the Valley of Mexico settled on {{an island in the}} Lake Texcoco and {{proceeded}} to subjugate the surrounding tribes. This group was the Mexica, who {{over the course of the}} next three centuries founded an empire named Tenochtitlan. Their political and linguistic influence came to extend into Central America and Nahuatl became a lingua franca among merchants and elites in Mesoamerica, e.g., among the Maya K'iche' people. As Tenochtitlan grew to become the largest urban center in Central America, it attracted speakers of Nahuatl from diverse areas giving birth to an urban form of Nahuatl with traits from many dialects. This urbanized variety of Tenochtitlan is what came to be known as Classical Nahuatl as documented in colonial times.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} of Tess was {{originally intended to}} be featured as the main antagonist <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Last</b> <b>of</b> Us, pursuing Joel for a year before a final confrontation in which she is killed by Ellie. However, the team {{found it difficult to}} believe that Tess would dispute with Joel and pursue him for a year; this was solved by significantly adjusting the story. Actress Annie Wersching was impressed by the script, and Druckmann's ability to write unique female characters. When writing the game's female characters, particularly Tess and Ellie, Druckmann avoided external influences, such as the media's portrayal of women, as he wished to write his own story.|$|E
