40|$|Despite a {{large number}} of {{investigations}} on the formation of the Goss-texture in Fe- 3 %Si electrical steels, the exact mechanisms leading to the preference of this particular orientation are not completely understood so far. As an alternative to the standard explanation of a favored growth of Goss-oriented grains during secondary recrystallization, recently the concept of <b>orientation</b> <b>pinning</b> has been proposed, which considers that the growth of grains with special orientation relationships corresponding to low-angle and twin grain boundaries is disfavored. The present paper present preliminary EBSD-results on the growth of Goss-grains during secondary recrystallization in high-permeability (HiB) transformer steel sheets.

40|$|In an {{investigation}} of nucleation of recrystallisation in an Interstitial Free steel {{it was found that}} new crystals were almost always contained within the rolled-out hot band grain envelopes and were mostly equiaxed. At a later stage they grew and had an aspect ratio of 2 : 1 but at the completion of recrystallisation were again equiaxed. This is explained by the notion that nucleation occurs relatively frequently in certain grains, that these nuclei have very similar orientations and are thus <b>orientation</b> <b>pinned</b> within the solute and precipitate containing envelopes of the hot band grains. Provided the misorientation is small the impinged group are capable of spheroidisation provided the driving force across the pinned boundary is sufficient to overcome the pinning, because, by definition, this pinned boundary is of high angle character. The theory, as it is presented as coalescence, relies on a form of Östwald ripening and therefore provides a possible explanation of why grain growth kinetics obeys a time exponent of between 1 / 2 and 1 / 3. A similar observation of high aspect ratio grains has been made many times in the case of cold rolled copper which forms cube texture. Again, nuclei are formed in the cube bands, but these are prevented from lengthening because of <b>orientation</b> <b>pinning.</b> However, when the length of a group of such impinged nuclei is sufficient, spheroidisation will produce equiaxed grains. © 2004 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|In a {{detailed}} {{scanning electron microscope}} study of the recrystallisation of an IF steel {{it was observed that}} the new grains went through an equiaxed stage which became elongated along the rolling direction and then became equiaxed again when recrystallisation was complete. A theory of how the final crystal structure arises from the deformed matrix is proposed in which grain impingement during growth, when it involves <b>orientation</b> <b>pinning,</b> is followed by crystal aggregate spheroidisation to give the final polycrystalline structure. This means that a proportion of grains in a recrystallised aggregate have arisen from several separate nucleation events. The model, which is general, has implications for texture formation and can apply to both primary and secondary recrystallisation. It can also explain why the grain growth exponent is usually measured to be between 2 and 3. © 2003 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The spectra show a marked in-plane anisotropy of the Zeeman interaction when the magnetic field lies in the support plane. The analysis of their angular dependence confirms that the plane of the phthalocyanine molecule is almost perpendicular to the film plane and gives evidence that the in-plane orientation anisotropy arises from two different distributions of <b>orientations</b> <b>pinned</b> around two average orientations having an angle of 68 degrees between them...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. An extra {{low carbon}} steel was cold rolled to 85 % {{reduction}} and annealed at 680 °C to generate a microstructure containing ~ 2 % recrystallized grains. A partly recrystallized volume was analyzed using 3 -D FIB-EBSD tomography. The results show that nucleation and subsequent growth of recrystallizing grains is more complex processes than that revealed using 2 -D metallographic techniques. In the present steel, {{it was found that}} subgrains were found to be the origin of nucleation and these grains exhibit an internal structure similar to the surrounding deformation substructure. However, a certain subgrain keeps expanding to a stage where some part or parts of the boundary reach(es) and consume(s) a high stored energy deformation zone(s) to form (a) local dislocation free zone(s) having an orientation similar to the subgrain. After this stage, the residual dislocations in the original subgrain are annihilated and nuclei enter a well-defined growth stage.

40|$|Developments in {{deformation}} and recrystallization textures {{were studied}} in cold-rolled (50 - 90 % reduction) ultra low carbon (ULC) steel using X-ray texture measurements and orientation imaging microscopy (OIM). During deformation, gamma-fibre (ND//(111)) increased between 0 and 50 % reduction but then {{did not change}} significantly, while alpha-fibre (RD//(110)) increased progressively from 0 to 90 % reduction. After complete recrystallization, however, a steady increase in gamma and almost no changes in alpha were observed with increasing strain. Developments in recrystallization textures were attributed to two parameters: (1) spacings (lambda(i), as measured along the normal direction, ND, where {{i can be a}} specific component of alpha/gamma-fibres) of the alpha/gamma deformed bands; and (2) their relative ability to form recrystallized grains. While lambda(i) was determined by the deformation texture and the thicknesses of the deformed grains/bands and naturally decreased with increasing strain, estimations of parameter (2) were obtained from the so-called nucleation factors (N-i, defined as the number of recrystallized i grains per i band-as measured/estimated along the ND). At higher strains, noticeable drops in the N(i) s of alpha-fibre were observed. Two plausible causes for such drops were increased stored energy advantages for gamma bands and <b>orientation</b> <b>pinning</b> in some of the alpha regions. (C) 1998 Acta Metallurgica Inc.

The methodology presents the theory and practical programming requirements for coupling existing computer design and analysis tools together into a new and powerful design system. The goal {{of this paper is to}} demonstrate the computational advantages of using implicit sensitivity with the boundary element method (BEM) within this system over other more brute force methods.

40|$|Asymmetric {{division}} of neural progenitors {{is a key}} mechanism by which neuronal diversity in the Drosophila central nervous system is generated. The distinct fates of the daughter cells derived from these divisions are achieved through preferential segregation of the cell fate determinants Prospero and Numb {{to one of the}} two daughters. This is achieved by coordinating apical and basal mitotic spindle orientation with the basal cortical localization of the cell fate determinants during mitosis. A complex of apically localized proteins, including Inscuteable (Insc), Partner of Inscuteable (Pins), Bazooka (Baz), DmPar- 6, DaPKC, and Gi, is required to mediate and coordinate basal protein localization with mitotic spindle <b>orientation.</b> <b>Pins,</b> a molecule which directly interacts with Insc, is a key component required for the integrity of this complex; in the absence of Pins, other components become mislocalized or destabilized, and basal protein localization and mitotic spindle orientation are defective. Here we define the functional domains of Pins. We show that the C-terminal region containing the Gi binding GoLoco motifs is necessary and sufficient for targeting to the neuroblast cortex, which appears to be a prerequisite for apical localization of Pins. The N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat-containing region of Pins is required for two processes; TPR repeats 1 to 3 plus the C-terminal region are required for apical localization but are insufficient to recruit Insc to the apical cortex, whereas TPR repeats 1 to 7 plus C-terminal Pins can perform both functions. Hence, the abilities of Pins to cortically localize, t...|$|R
40|$|Two recent {{ideas for}} {{understanding}} and modeling {{the development of}} cube recrystallization texture in rolled and plane strain deformed aluminum and copper have been tested by experimental studies. The ideas are: (i) the concept called either 'orientation pinning' or 'variant inhibition'-the inhibition {{of the growth of}} recrystallized grains by contact with regions in the deformed material with similar orientation, and (ii) the simple model, alpha(C) = N(C) (d) over bar(R) /lambda(C), for predicting the frequency of recrystallized cube grains based on nucleation from closely spaced deformed cube bands inherited from pre-existing cube grains. lambda(C) is the mean spacing between deformed cube bands, (d) over bar(R) is the thickness of the recrystallized grains, both measured in the normal direction, ND, and N(C) is the number of cube grains per cube band in a linear traverse in ND. Detailed experimental results by orientation imaging microscopy have confirmed the importance of <b>orientation</b> <b>pinning</b> in preventing the development of the majority deformation texture components in warm deformed aluminum since here (d) over bar(R) > lambda(V), the inter-variant spacing of the rolling texture variants. In the same material cold rolled to an equivalent strain, retained rolling texture developed since, after cold rolling, (d) over bar(R) < lambda(V). Direct experiments have also confirmed each of the assumptions underlying the simple cube frequency model. Comparisons between the very different texture results found using only slightly different starting materials indicate the need for more quantitative experimental and modeling studies on the role of starting microstructure, grain size, shape and texture, {{on the development of the}} deformed microstructure, particularly on cube grain stability and grain fragmentation.

40|$|In {{the context}} of regular {{arithmetic}} circuits, the effect of pin placement {{on the quality of}} layout and routing is not well understood. Current methodologies depend on library-based flows to design such circuits. However, the benefits of regularity are lost in the process of automated place and route techniques employed by these methodologies.

40|$|SummaryDuring development, {{directional}} {{cell division}} {{is a major}} mechanism for establishing the orientation of tissue growth. Drosophila neuroblasts undergo asymmetric divisions perpendicular to the overlying epithelium to produce descendant neurons on the opposite side, thereby orienting initial neural tissue growth. However, the mechanism remains elusive. We provide genetic evidence that extrinsic GPCR signaling determines the orientation of cortical polarity underlying asymmetric divisions of neuroblasts relative to the epithelium. The GPCR Tre 1 activates the G protein oα subunit in neuroblasts by interacting with the epithelium to recruit Pins, which regulates spindle <b>orientation.</b> Because <b>Pins</b> associates with the Par-complex via Inscuteable, Tre 1 consequently recruits the polarity complex to orthogonally orient the polarity axis to the epithelium.

40|$|In the Sambagawa schist, {{southwest}} Japan, while ductile deformation pervasively {{occurred at}} D 1 phase during exhumation, low-angle normal faulting was locally intensive at D 2 phase under {{the conditions of}} frictional-viscous transition of quartz (c. 300 ℃) during further exhumation into the upper crustal level. Accordingly, the formation of D 2 shear bands was overprinted on type I crossed girdle quartz c-axis fabrics and microstructures formed by intracrystalline plasticity at D 1 phase in some quartz schists. The quartz c-axis fabrics became weak and finally random with increasing shear, accompanied by the decreasing degree of undulation of recrystallized quartz grain boundaries, which resulted from the increasing portion of straight grain boundaries coinciding with the interfaces between newly precipitated quartz and mica. We interpreted these facts as caused by increasing activity of pressure solution: the quartz grains were dissolved mostly at platy quartz-mica interface, and precipitated with random <b>orientation</b> and <b>pinned</b> by mica, thus having led to the obliteration of existing quartz c-axis fabrics. In the sheared quartz schist, the strength became reduced by the enhanced pressure solution creep not only due to the reduction of diffusion path length caused by increasing number of shear bands, but also to enhanced dissolution at the interphase boundaries...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{simulations}} of the pinning properties and vortex dynamics in thin superconducting film with three different periodic arrays of magnetic dots: (1) all magnetic dots have the same magnetization <b>orientation</b> (ferromagnetic <b>pinning</b> array); (2) magnetic dots with up and down magnetization orientation are arranged alternatively, to form an antiferromagnetic two-dimensional array; and (3) {{the same as the}} previous array, but each dot is replaced by a 2 x 2 magnetic dot subarray. All dots in the subarray have the same magnetization orientation. We calculated the critical depinning force and magnetization {{as a function of the}} applied magnetic field for these three arrays. Due to the field polarity-dependent flux pinning effect of the magnetic dots, asymmetric pinning behavior in the first array can be switched to the symmetric one in the latter two arrays while keeping the pronounced matching effects. We also calculated the current-voltage characteristics at both commensurate and incommensurate fields. We found that at the first matching field, the transition from the pinned phase to a vortex motion phase is continuous for the ferromagnetic configuration but discontinuous for the two antiferromagnetic configurations. This can be explained by different vortex dynamical trajectories.

40|$|For the {{application}} of Ni- 5 at. %W as substrate for high-temperature superconductors {{the development of a}} very intense Cube texture is essential. Therefore, the texture development in Ni- 5 at. %W was studied in detail by experiments and computer simulations. Cold rolling of the material resulted in a pronounced Beta-fiber texture which transformed by recrystallization into a strong Cube texture and then sharpened further during subsequent grain growth. The cold rolling process was found to be limited by the occurrence of deformation inhomogeneities to strains of epsilon = 3 - 4 and {{led to the formation of}} Cube deformation bands. These bands formed very effective nucleation sites during recrystallization if epsilon > 2. 5. The deformation texture evolution could be successfully simulated with the grain interaction model (GIA) when a certain amount of random shear deformation was allowed. During annealing of cold rolled Ni- 5 at. %W recrystallization nuclei emerged from the deformed Cube bands earlier and with higher frequency than for any other orientation and the Cube volume fraction increased from 0. 1 % to 50 %. Furthermore, the Cube nuclei had the highest mean misorientation of all orientations and thus they had the highest fraction of mobile high angle boundaries (HAGB). Together with the nucleation advantage this led to a bimodal size distribution of large Cube grains and smaller grains of other orientations after recrystallization was completed. If the annealing temperature for recrystallization was too high this nucleation and growth advantage of the Cube grains was reduced. Thus, a two-step annealing process with a lower temperature for recrystallization and a higher temperature for the grain growth stage was found to be beneficial. With the statistical recrystallization texture model (StaRT) the development of the recrystallization texture was simulated based on results of a previous GIA simulation and an experimentally determined nucleation spectrum. A delay function was implemented into the model to consider the faster nucleation of the Cube orientation. The bimodal size distribution after recrystallization gave the Cube grains a growth advantage during grain growth. Only with such a bimodal distribution the increase of the Cube volume fraction by grain growth could be successfully simulated with a vertex network model. The Cube volume fraction increased to 80 % as determined with ODF calculations which corresponds to an actual volume fraction of 90 - 95 %. Grain growth in Cube textured Ni- 5 at. %W was impeded by the <b>orientation</b> <b>pinning</b> effect caused by the high fraction of low-mobility low angle grain boundaries (LAGB). The strong texture also makes the material prone to abnormal grain growth (AGG), whereat non-Cube grains with mobile HAGBs grew abnormally large and consumed the Cube textured matrix. Both, recrystallization and grain growth, were affected by the annealing atmosphere, i. e. by oxidation which especially reduced the mobility of HAGBs. While during recrystallization this effect impedes the formation of the Cube texture it reduces the risk of AGG at higher annealing temperatures. With an established model for the formation of annealing twins the stacking fault energy of Ni- 5 at. %W was determined as gammaSF = 51 mJ/m 2. The decrease of the annealing twin density with texture sharpness could be attributed to a reduction of the mean grain boundary energy. In conclusion, a through process simulation of the texture development in Ni- 5 at. %W was established and optimal parameters for the formation of a sharp Cube texture were determined and discussed...|$|R

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) {{has been used to}} determine the defects which are responsible for the flux pinning related to the anomalous Je peak.

Numerous tacking faults involving excess Cu-O layers have also been observed; these can also serve as effective flux pinners. Small-angle planar boundaries perpendicular to the substrate are rarely seen. Images of the YBCO-substrate interface reveal that some of the columnar growth defects initiate at substrate steps/dislocations. The YBCO unit cells grown on the upper and lower terraces of a substrate step have a relative shift of c/ 3 [001]; thus, the Cu-O planes are broken within a region less than 10 mn from the substrate, presumably reducing the superconducting order parameter in this region and leading to pinned vortices ituated on these sites.

40|$|Introduction. Shooting {{injuries}} of {{shoulder with}} destruction of proximal humerus are rare and severe orthopaedic injuries. Case Outline. A 74 -year-old patient was wounded {{at close range}} by a shotgun. He {{was wounded in the}} left shoulder and suffered a massive defect of the proximal humerus and soft tissue. The neurocirculatory finding of the injury extremity was normal. After a short resuscitation, x-ray of the thorax and the left shoulder registered a complet destruction of humeral head. After the primary treatment of the wound under general endotracheal anesthesia, the shoulder was stabilized with an external fixator type Mitkovic, with convergent <b>orientation</b> of the <b>pins,</b> where two pins were placed in the neck of scapula and two in the humeral shaft, because the left scapular acromion was fractured by shotgun projectiles. Conclusion. After radical wound debridement, external fixation is the method of choice for shoulder stabilisation in shooting injury of shoulder with bone defect. If this is not possible, pins of the left external skeletal fixator should be placed into the coracoid process and acromion. The pins can be also placed into the humeral shaft, as done in the presented case, and by which a good stability of the injured proximal humerus, easy approach to the wound for bandaging and reconstructive surgery can be achieved...|$|R
40|$|Signaling systems {{regulate}} {{the flow of}} cellular information by organizing proteins {{in space and time}} to coordinate a variety of cellular activities that are critical for the proper development, function, and maintenance of cells. Signaling molecules can exhibit several levels of complexity through the utilization of modular protein interactions, which can generate simple linear behaviors or complex behaviors such as ultrasensitivity. Protein modularity also serves {{as the basis for the}} vast protein networks that form the regulatory networks that govern several biological activities. My work focuses on the importance of protein modularity in complex biological systems, in particular the regulatory pathways of spindle positioning. 	The first part of my work involves the construction of a synthetic regulatory network using modular protein interactions in an effort to understand the complex behavior of the natural spindle <b>orientation</b> regulator <b>Pins.</b> Utilizing well-characterized protein domains and their binding partners, I built an autoinhibited protein switch that can be activated by a small protein domain. We found that the input-output relationship of the synthetic protein switch could be tuned by the simple addition of "decoy" domains, domains that bind and sequester input signal, thereby impeding the onset of the output response to generate an input threshold. By varying the number and affinities of the decoy domains, we found that we could transform a simple linear response into a complex, ultrasensitive one. Thus, modular protein interactions can serve as a source of complex behaviors. 	The second part of my work focuses on elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying spindle positioning in the Drosophila neuroblast. I found that Pins orients the mitotic spindle by coordinating two opposite-polarity microtubule motors Dynein and Kinesin- 73 through its multiple domains. Kinesin- 73 also relies on its modular domain architecture to perform its duties in Pins-mediated spindle positioning, where its N-terminal half functions in coordinating cortical-microtubule capture while its C-terminal half functions as a region necessary for the activation of Dynein. Thus, modular protein design allows for the organization of spindle orientation regulators in space to achieve the complex biological activity that is spindle positioning.

40|$|Aim. To {{present the}} {{possibility}} of a successful use of external skeletal fixation in treating the open and closed tibial shaft fractures with Mitković’s external fixator. Methods. External fixation was used in 115 patients with 118 fresh tibial shaft fractures, 82 males (71. 3 %) and 33 females (28. 7 %), average age 43. 92 years (16 − 84). Open tibial shaft fractures were present in 37 (31. 36 %). All the fractures were treated with Mitković’s external fixator type M 20. Results. The results of external fixation were excellent or good in 94. 07 % of the cases, and bad in 5. 08 %. Pin tract infection appeared in 7 (5. 93 %) patients. In only 3 cases an external fixator was removed and treatment continued with the functional braces. Nonunion occurred in 6 (5. 08 %) patients, of which 4 were with open fractures (2 Gustilo type IIIB, 1 Gustilo type IIIA, 1 Gustilo type II) and 2 with the segment fractures. Compartment syndrome was observed in 1 (0. 85 %) patient with closed fracture. Malunion was found in 2 (1. 69 %) patients. Conclusion. External fixation of tibial shaft fractures is a simple and effective method to enable the safe healing of fractures, early mobilization of the patients, early weight-bearing, as well as early rehabilitation. Fixation of tibial shaft fractures was unilateral with convergent <b>pins</b> <b>orientation,</b> and there was also a possibility of compression and distraction...|$|R
40|$|Summary. The {{external}} fixation of tibial shaft fractures with Mitkovic's {{external fixator}} {{is a simple}} and effective method for everyday orthopaedic-traumatology praxis. The fixation is unilateral with convergent <b>pins</b> <b>orientation</b> (45 - 90 degrees), {{and there is also}} possibility for compression and distraction. Pins are placed without any guidance. The result of external fixation in 49 patients with tibial shaft fractures, 30 (61. 22 %) men and 19 (38. 77 %) women, average age 43. 92 years old (16 - 84), are presented in this work. The open tibial shaft fractures was 14 (28. 57 %). All fractures are treated with Mitkovic external fixator type M 20. The results applied external fixation method are excellent and good. Union rate was 83. 68 %. Pin tract infection appeared in 4 (8. 16 %) patients. In only 3 cases the external fixator was removed and treatment continued with application the functional braces. Nonunion rate was in 6 (12. 24 %) patients, of which 4 with opened fractures (two Gustilo type IIIB, one Gustilo type IIIA, one Gustilo type II) and 2 with the segment fractures.
