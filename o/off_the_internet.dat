500|$|Murdock {{begins the}} season {{wearing a black}} costume (called the [...] "vigilante outfit" [...] by production), {{inspired}} by the one worn by the character in Frank Miller's The Man Without Fear, rather than the more traditional red, horned suit. This was done to highlight the formation of Matt Murdock as Daredevil, with the costume evolving over time as the character develops. Marvel Comics' Chief Creative Officer Quesada conceptualized the look based on DeKnight's specifications. On the design process, DeKnight revealed that [...] "we tried practically everything, design-wise. We experimented {{with a lot of}} different head pieces. One version was a ski mask with the eyes sewn shut. We tried everything until we found something that just felt right." [...] DeKnight and Quesada explained that the idea was for Murdock to start out with a homemade outfit that fits more in the [...] "real-world" [...] of the series, and to then evolve it into the classic Daredevil suit. Maslansky noted that they wanted the outfit to [...] "look like something that Matt Murdock could put together himself, that he could either order <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> or shop around town....we wound up with pretty practical choices for him. His shirts are compression shirts and his pants wound up being from an army/navy store." [...] Concerning the black mask, Maslansky noted that a balance between aesthetic and safety was required, and that it was made of layers of cotton mesh that [...] "really conform to his head" [...] but also allowed Cox to see through the mask.|$|E

The proliferation of sex chat rooms has increased the opportunity for people in committed relationships to engage in acts of infidelity on and <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet.</b> [...] A cyber affair is defined as [...] "a romantic or sexual relationship initiated by online contact and maintained primarily via online communication" [...] (Young et al., 2000). Sexual acts online include behaviors such as cybersex, where two or more individuals engage in discussions about sexual fantasies over the Internet and is usually accompanied by sexual self-stimulation, , where discussions between two or more people move away from light hearted flirting, and emotional acts where people disclose intimate information to a significant other (Whitty, 2004). A new type of sexual activity online is when two people's avatars engage in sexual activity in virtual reality worlds such The Sims or Second Life. According to a report by Randall & Byers (2003) the majority of Americans believe that if a partner engaged in cybersex this constitutes as an act of infidelity.|$|E
