Experiment was conducted using permanent planting basins (PPB) at two locations i. e., NARL-Kawanda and NgeZARDI. The experiment was laid in a randomized complete block design with 3 replications. The treatments were maize: 3, 4, and 5 seeds per PPB, i. e., maintaining population of 44400, 59200 and 74000 plants ha- 1, respectively; beans: 6, 8, and 10 seeds per PPB. The 3 and 6 plants basin- 1 for maize and beans respectively were the control treatments. An open pollinated maize variety Longe- 5 and a bean variety NABE- 15 were used.

The effects of genotypes and cultural practices, and their interactions on rosette disease incidence were significant at pegging stage under high disease pressure in all seasons. The genotypic differences in disease incidence were spectacular under high disease infestation in all seasons. Resistant genotypes gave higher pod yields than susceptible genotypes under high disease incidence, irrespective of sowing time and plant population. However, pod yields were higher for early sown treatments at <b>optimum</b> plant <b>population.</b> There were no marked differences in pod yield between genotypes under low disease pressure. Overall, the combination of resistant genotypes with early sowing at <b>optimum</b> plant <b>population</b> exhibited the best performance under high disease infestation. Although the resistant genotypes gave the highest pod yields under high disease infestation, pod yields were consistently lower than the yields under low disease situation probably because of their susceptibility to groundnut rosette assistor virus (GRAV) component...|$|R

40|$|Farmers {{who want}} to reduce high input costs face a {{decision}} at planting time: How many seeds per acre {{to put in the}} soil? Planting fewer seeds per acre saves money up front, but how does plant population affect yield? The optimum density or plant population for any given situation results in mature plants that are sufficiently crowded to efficiently use resources such as water, nutrients, and sunlight, yet not so crowded that some plants die or are unproductive. At this population, production from the entire field is optimized, although any individual plant might produce less than would have occurred with unlimited space. Many factors influence the <b>optimum</b> plant <b>population</b> for a crop: availability of water, nutrients and sunlight; length of growing season; potential plant size; and the plant’s capacity to change its form in response to varying environmental conditions (morphological plasticity). One example of this is tillering, which allows small grain crops like winter wheat to produce the same number of heads and final grain yield in a given area over a wide range of plant densities. Modern corn cultivars, on the other hand, have been selected to produce few if any tillers. Consequently, corn has a relatively narrow range for <b>optimum</b> plant <b>population...</b>|$|R

40|$|Minimizing {{energetic}} {{cost per}} unit distance is often considered the major criterion that anadromous migrants seek to optimize during upstream migration. To test this theory, we documented energetic expenditures and travel speeds of 15 anadrornous fish populations involving 9 species abserved during their upstredm migration. Parameters that characterized fish migratory {{behavior and the}} spawning river were calculated for each popula-tion. Bn most cases, cost per unit distance is not minimized and migratory strategy does not conform ts the theoretical <b>optimum.</b> <b>Populations</b> that make long or difficult migrations are more efficient {{in their use of}} energy reserves than populations that make shorter migrations. Only populations that need all their energy to complete the migration swim at speeds that approach the theoretical optimum. Migration length may Bead to improved migratory efficiency by selecting for larger body size, more accurate upstream orientation, and travel speeds that optimize energy efficiency. The failure to minimize energy expenditures is sometimes due to environmental constraints that exceed the physiological capacities of migrants. Minimizing the probablity of death due to exhaustion may be the major factor determining migratory behavior. Selection for energetic efficiency appears important only in cases where energy reserves are exhausted during migration.

Soybean seeding rate recommendations in many states were developed prior {{to the release of}} herbicide tolerant varieties when soybean seed costs were lower. As a result, many recommendations are high, and soybean performance at low plant densities in narrow rows needs to be reevaluated. This study was conducted to evaluate soybean yield response to plant density in narrow row, drilled systems (7. 5 and 15 in) and evaluate the effects of plant population on yield components. The study was conducted in six environments with <b>optimum</b> plant <b>populations</b> ranging from 80 000 to 140 000 plants acre [superscript]- 1. The two yield components responsible for the yield optimization were pods plant [superscript]- 1 and pods acre [superscript]- 1.

The <b>optimum</b> seeding rates for each year of the study were below the 150 000 to 160 000 plants acre [superscript]- 1 seeding rate normally recommended in the region.
