50|$|The {{applicability}} of jurisdiction {{in cases involving}} activities over the Internet is interesting because an <b>out-of-state</b> <b>resident</b> can very easily cause an impact {{in the state in}} question, leading to questions of how large the impact need be before exercising jurisdiction is constitutional.|$|E
5000|$|Right against {{discrimination}} on the basis of out-of-State residenceSection 117 prohibits disability or discrimination in one state against a resident of another state. This is interpreted widely: the restriction will be invalid if it treats an <b>out-of-state</b> <b>resident</b> more onerously than if they were resident within the state. However, it does not prohibit states from imposing residential requirements where these are required by the State's autonomy and its responsibility to its people; a state may, for example, permit only residents to vote in state elections.|$|E
5000|$|Boschetto v. Hansing, 539 F.3d 1011 (9th Cir. 2008) [...] is a {{diversity}} jurisdiction case brought by California resident, Paul Boschetto ("Boschetto") against certain private corporations with their principal {{place of business}} in Wisconsin. The case involved the determination of the question whether the sale of an item via the internet consumer-to-consumer trading portal, eBay, by the defendants in Wisconsin to the plaintiff in California, was sufficient to confer personal jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant in the buyer's forum state. At the first instance, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California decided against Boschetto and held that a lone “eBay sale consummated with a California purchaser, was insufficient to establish jurisdiction over any of the defendants.” [...] Boschetto appealed against the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The appellate court affirmed the decision of the district court and denied relief to Boschetto. The Court became the first federal appellate court to address whether personal jurisdiction in a forum state could be established when an <b>out-of-state</b> <b>resident</b> makes use of an intermediary website accessible by forum-state citizens.|$|E
