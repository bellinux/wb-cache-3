40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{evaluating}} {{the influence of}} frequency balance <b>of</b> containers for <b>sorted</b> for sorted waste for the intensity <b>of</b> <b>sorting</b> in two locations in České Budějovice.

40|$|Sorting {{is still}} one of the most {{important}} problems in Computer Science. Work in transformational programming and automatic program synthesis provided the insight that led to Merritt's inverted taxonomy <b>of</b> <b>sorting</b> algorithms, a high-level, top-down, conceptually simple and symmetric categorization <b>of</b> <b>sorting</b> algorithms. More recent work in logic-based program synthesis by Lau has produced a logical taxonomy <b>of</b> <b>sorting</b> algorithms. This provides a logical basis for the inverted taxonomy and expands it into a logical inverted taxonomy to include distributive sorting algorithms which can be derived along with comparison-based algorithms. The inclusion of distributive algorithms into a unified conceptual framework is new and significant for a comprehensive perspective on sorting algorithms. In this paper, we describe both the inverted and the logical taxonomies and show how the latter strengthens the latter and expands it into a logical inverted taxonomy <b>of</b> <b>sorting</b> algorithms, a highlevel [...] ...|$|R
