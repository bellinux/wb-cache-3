5|$|Thallium {{is found}} in the {{minerals}} crookesite TlCu7Se4, hutchinsonite TlPbAs5S9, and lorándite TlAsS2. Thallium also <b>occurs</b> <b>as</b> a trace element in iron pyrite, and thallium is extracted as a by-product of roasting this mineral for the production of sulfuric acid.|$|E
5|$|The barium mineral, benitoite (barium {{titanium}} silicate), <b>occurs</b> <b>as</b> a {{very rare}} blue fluorescent gemstone, and is the official state gem of California.|$|E
5|$|Vanadinite <b>occurs</b> <b>as</b> a {{secondary}} mineral in the oxidized zone of lead-bearing deposits, the vanadium is leached from wall-rock silicates. Associated minerals include mimetite, pyromorphite, descloizite, mottramite, wulfenite, cerussite, anglesite, calcite, barite, and various iron oxide minerals.|$|E

5000|$|Buwal has the vowels , {{which can}} occur in high, middle, or low tone. Each vowel {{has a variety of}} phonetic realizations. [...] can <b>occur</b> <b>as</b> , and [...] can <b>occur</b> <b>as</b> [...] The schwa can be {{analyzed}} as a solely epenthetic vowel. They <b>occur</b> <b>as</b> rounded allophones when adjacent to a labialized consonant, and as front vowels when the word is palatalized.|$|R
5|$|After {{the initial}} {{sequence}} of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can be deformed and/or metamorphosed. Deformation typically <b>occurs</b> <b>as</b> {{a result of}} horizontal shortening, horizontal extension, or side-to-side (strike-slip) motion. These structural regimes broadly relate to convergent boundaries, divergent boundaries, and transform boundaries, respectively, between tectonic plates.|$|E
5|$|Although it is toxic {{in large}} doses, {{selenium}} {{is an essential}} micronutrient for animals. In plants, it <b>occurs</b> <b>as</b> a bystander mineral, sometimes in toxic proportions in forage (some plants may accumulate selenium as a defense against being eaten by animals, but other plants, such as locoweed, require selenium, and their growth indicates the presence of selenium in soil). See more on plant nutrition below.|$|E
5|$|Cobalt in {{compound}} form <b>occurs</b> <b>as</b> a {{minor component}} of copper and nickel minerals. It {{is the major}} metallic component in combination with sulfur and arsenic in the sulfidic cobaltite (CoAsS), safflorite (CoAs2), glaucodot ((Co,Fe)AsS), and skutterudite (CoAs3) minerals. The mineral cattierite is similar to pyrite and occurs together with vaesite in the copper deposits of the Katanga Province. Upon contact with the atmosphere, weathering occurs and the sulfide minerals oxidize to form pink erythrite ("cobalt glance": Co3(AsO4)2·8H2O) and spherocobaltite (CoCO3).|$|E
50|$|Somatogyral illusions <b>occur</b> <b>as</b> {{a result}} of angular {{accelerations}} stimulating the semicircular canals. Somatogravic illusions, on the other hand, <b>occur</b> <b>as</b> {{a result of}} linear accelerations stimulating the otolith organs.|$|R
50|$|In Attic Greek, {{any single}} {{consonant}} and many consonant clusters can <b>occur</b> <b>as</b> a syllable onset (the {{beginning of a}} syllable). Certain consonant clusters <b>occur</b> <b>as</b> onsets, while others do not occur.|$|R
50|$|Most {{of these}} rocks <b>occur</b> <b>as</b> dikes, diatremes, lopoliths or laccoliths, and very rarely, intrusions. Most {{kimberlite}} and lamproite occurrences <b>occur</b> <b>as</b> volcanic and subvolcanic diatremes and maars; lavas are virtually unknown.|$|R
5|$|Epilepsy that <b>occurs</b> <b>as</b> {{a result}} of other issues may be preventable. Seizures are {{controllable}} with medication in about 70% of cases. Inexpensive options are often available. In those whose seizures {{do not respond to}} medication, then surgery, neurostimulation, or dietary changes may be considered. Not all cases of epilepsy are lifelong, and many people improve to the point that treatment is no longer needed.|$|E
5|$|Habitat {{destruction}} {{represents a}} threat to biodiversity in Croatia, as developed and agricultural land is expanded into previous natural habitats, while habitat fragmentation <b>occurs</b> <b>as</b> roads are created or expanded. A further threat to biodiversity is the introduction of invasive species, with Caulerpa racemosa and C. taxifolia identified as especially problematic ones. The invasive algae are monitored and regularly removed to protect the benthic habitat. Agricultural monocultures have also been identified as {{a threat to}} biodiversity.|$|E
5|$|In {{the long}} term {{there will be a}} {{switchover}} from analogue to digital radio when the AM and FM services will cease. The government has set criteria on the coverage and proportion of digital listening before this <b>occurs.</b> <b>As</b> of 2017 these criteria have not yet been reached and a switchover is unlikely before 2020.|$|E

5|$|Manitoba's economy {{relies heavily}} on agriculture, tourism, energy, oil, mining, and forestry. Agriculture is vital and is found mostly in the {{southern}} half of the province, although grain farming <b>occurs</b> <b>as</b> far north as The Pas. Around 12 percent of Canadian farmland is in Manitoba. The {{most common type of}} farm found in rural areas is cattle farming (34.6%), followed by assorted grains (19.0%) and oilseed (7.9%).|$|E
5|$|On Earth, thorium {{is not a}} rare element as was {{previously}} thought, having a crustal abundance {{comparable to that of}} lead and molybdenum, twice that of arsenic, and three times that of tin. Thorium only <b>occurs</b> <b>as</b> a minor constituent of most minerals. Soil normally contains about 6 ppm of thorium.|$|E
5|$|Peléan eruptions are {{characterized}} most prominently by the incandescent pyroclastic flows that they drive. The mechanics of a Peléan eruption {{are very similar}} to that of a Vulcanian eruption, except that in Peléan eruptions the volcano's structure is able to withstand more pressure, hence the eruption <b>occurs</b> <b>as</b> one large explosion rather than several smaller ones.|$|E
50|$|Arrests still <b>occur</b> <b>as</b> of 2005.|$|R
50|$|Fatty acids (or their salts) do {{not often}} <b>occur</b> <b>as</b> such in {{biological}} systems. Instead fatty acids like oleic acid <b>occur</b> <b>as</b> their esters, commonly triglycerides, {{which are the}} greasy materials in many natural oils. Fatty acids can be obtained via the process of saponification.|$|R
50|$|Not {{all natural}} {{oligosaccharides}} <b>occur</b> <b>as</b> components of glycoproteins or glycolipids. Some, {{such as the}} raffinose series, <b>occur</b> <b>as</b> storage or transport carbohydrates in plants. Others, such as maltodextrins or cellodextrins, result from the microbial breakdown of larger polysaccharides such as starch or cellulose.|$|R
5|$|Semiconducting single-walled carbon {{nanotubes}} emit near-infrared light upon photoexcitation, described interchangeably as fluorescence or photoluminescence (PL). The excitation of PL usually <b>occurs</b> <b>as</b> follows: {{an electron}} in a nanotube absorbs excitation light via S22 transition, creating an electron-hole pair (exciton). Both electron and hole rapidly relax (via phonon-assisted processes) from c2 to c1 and from v2 to v1 states, respectively. Then they recombine through a c1−v1 transition resulting in light emission.|$|E
5|$|Slow to fast {{skeletal}} TnI isoform switch <b>occurs</b> <b>as</b> {{an indicator}} for slow to fast fiber type transition in muscle adaptations. Slow skeletal TnI {{has been proposed}} as a sensitive and muscle fiber type-specific marker for skeletal muscle injuries. In patients with skeletal muscle disorders, intact ssTnI or its degraded products may be detected in peripheral blood as a diagnostic indicator for slow fiber damages.|$|E
5|$|The Antarctic scallop {{does not}} itself have many predators and large {{individuals}} are adept at jumping and swimming to escape attackers. Any attached juveniles benefit from this. However, the scallops are intolerant of low salinity levels, and mortality sometimes <b>occurs</b> <b>as</b> {{a result of}} a pool of relatively fresh water that sometimes forms during the summer months under the sea ice as it melts.|$|E
