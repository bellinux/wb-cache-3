5|$|Ambulances {{may also}} carry an emblem (either {{as part of}} the passive warning {{markings}} or not), such as a Red Cross, Red Crescent <b>or</b> <b>Red</b> Crystal (collective known as the Protective Symbols).

Use by any other person, organization or agency is in breach of international law. The protective symbols are designed to indicate to all people (especially combatants in the case of war) that the vehicle is neutral and is not to be fired upon, hence giving protection to the medics and their casualties, although this has not always been adhered to.

5000|$|For example, a Bayesian would {{model the}} color of a car as a {{probability}} distribution over (red, green, blue), assigning one number to each color.

This may be computationally more efficient if a witness reports [...] "I saw that the car was either blue or green" [...] in which case the belief can be assigned in a single step rather than breaking down into values for two separate colors. However this can lead to irrational conclusions.|$|R
