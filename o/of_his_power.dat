5|$|Also at Royal Rumble 1995, The Undertaker faced Irwin R. Schyster {{as part of}} The Undertaker's {{feud with}} Ted DiBiase's Million Dollar Corporation. During the match, King Kong Bundy, another Corporation member, {{interfered}} and enabled the Corporation to steal The Undertaker's urn, which {{was said to be}} the source <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1933, Truman {{was named}} Missouri's {{director}} for the Federal Re-Employment program (part of the Civil Works Administration) {{at the request of}} Postmaster General James Farley. This was payback to Pendergast for delivering the Kansas City vote to Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1932 presidential election. The appointment confirmed Pendergast's control over federal patronage jobs in Missouri and marked the zenith <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>power.</b> It also created a relationship between Truman and Roosevelt aide Harry Hopkins and assured Truman's avid support for the New Deal.|$|E
5|$|In 491 BC, Darius sent emissaries {{to all the}} Greek city-states, {{asking for}} a gift of 'earth and water' in token of their {{submission}} to him. Having had a demonstration <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>power</b> the previous year, the majority of Greek cities duly obliged. In Athens, however, the ambassadors were put on trial and then executed by throwing them in a pit; in Sparta, they were simply thrown down a well. This meant that Sparta was also effectively at war with Persia.|$|E

5|$|Mubarak {{initially}} gave concessions, {{including the}} dissolution of parliament, agreeing to oversee a process of reform, and promising not to run for reelection in September2011. The protesters, however, were not satisfied and by February8 there were widespread calls for Mubarak's resignation. On the night of 10February, Mubarak gave a speech {{in which it was}} expected he would step down. Anger erupted when he stated plans to merely delegate some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>power.</b> By the next day, 11 February 2011, he had resigned.|$|E
5|$|Secretariat's {{absence of}} major {{conformation}} flaws was important, as horses with well made limbs and feet {{are less likely}} to become injured. Secretariat's hindquarters were the main source <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>power,</b> with a sloped croup that extended the length of his femur. When in full stride, his hind legs were able to reach far under himself, increasing his drive. His ample girth, long back and well-made neck all contributed to his heart-lung efficiency.|$|E

50|$|Some years later, Brain Storm {{turned up}} again, this time {{without the benefit}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>powers.</b> He kidnapped the Terrorsmith in the hopes <b>of</b> using <b>his</b> <b>powers</b> to reactivate <b>his</b> own lost abilities. This plan proved {{unsuccessful}} however, and the Terrorsmith was able to escape.|$|R

5|$|Abd al-Rahman at {{this time}} was a {{flamboyant}} figure with broad popular support. His stature served to diminish that of the politicians, who were seen as his followers rather than as leaders. Abd al-Rahman could not afford a sudden British withdrawal, since that would {{open the door for}} an Egyptian take-over and the loss <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>power.</b> The British also were against an Egyptian take-over, but for different reasons. Yet Abd al-Rahman could not be seen as supporting an indefinite colonial status, and continued to promote independence. Abd al-Rahman and the British were engaged in delicate and unstable arrangements characterized by mutual distrust.|$|E
5|$|Around 1845, Rosas {{managed to}} {{establish}} absolute dominance over the region. He exercised complete control over {{all aspects of}} society with the solid backing of the army. Rosas was raised from colonel to brigadier general (the highest army rank) on 18 December 1829. On 12 November 1840 he declined the newly created and higher rank of grand marshal (gran mariscal), which had been bestowed on him by the House of Representatives. The army was led by officers who had backgrounds and values similar to his. Confident <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>power,</b> Rosas made some concessions by returning confiscated properties to their owners, disbanding the Mazorca and ending torture and political assassinations. The inhabitants of Buenos Aires still dressed and behaved according to the set of rules Rosas had imposed, but the climate of constant and widespread fear greatly diminished.|$|E
5|$|By 1941, Göring was at {{the peak}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>power</b> and influence, and Hitler {{designated}} him as his successor and deputy in all his offices. As the Second World War progressed, Göring's standing with Hitler and with the German public declined after the Luftwaffe proved incapable of preventing the Allied bombing of German cities and resupplying surrounded German forces in Stalingrad. Around that time, Göring increasingly withdrew from the military and political scene to devote his attention to collecting property and artwork, much of which was taken from Jewish victims of the Holocaust. Informed on 22 April 1945 that Hitler intended to commit suicide, Göring sent a telegram to Hitler requesting permission to assume control of the Reich. Considering it an act of treason, Hitler removed Göring from all his positions, expelled him from the party, and ordered his arrest.|$|E

50|$|Captain Dynamo {{had five}} known superhuman abilities, {{the result of}} {{exposure}} forty years earlier to an unidentified form of radiation. The full extent of these abilities is unknown, however a clue to this may lie in his five children, who each inherited one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>powers</b> genetically from him. Whether their manifestation <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>powers</b> exactly mirrors <b>his</b> own or exceeds them, however, is unclear.|$|R
50|$|Alex {{was later}} {{captured}} by Larry Trask and his Sentinels, who were bent on controlling or eradicating all mutants. Trask fashioned a costume for Alex {{that would help}} him control <b>his</b> <b>powers</b> and Alex was given the code name Havok. Trask {{turned out to be}} a mutant himself and the Sentinels were defeated by the X-Men. Havok lost control <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>powers,</b> however, and <b>his</b> excess energy was absorbed by Sauron. Havok then gained control <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>powers.</b>|$|R
5|$|Democrats in the General Assembly were outraged. When the 1930 {{legislative}} session convened, they immediately {{passed a bill}} that stripped Sampson <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>power</b> to appoint a highway commissioner, giving it to a three-person commission composed of the governor, lieutenant governor, and attorney general. The Republican Sampson would be outnumbered and outvoted in this group. Confident that the Democrats would not lose another gubernatorial election, Democratic legislators stipulated in the bill that the appointment power {{would return to the}} governor in 1931, the end of Sampson's term. The law passed the House by a vote of 53—42 and the Senate by a vote of 22—15. Sampson vetoed the bill, but the veto was overridden, and Johnson was returned to his former position.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{overthrow}} of al-Shishakli, Syria held its first democratic elections in five years. The Ba'ath Party, led by Aflaq, al-Bitar and al-Hawrani, had 22 members elected to parliament. This increase in influence can largely be attributed to al-Hawrani – several old ASP strongholds voted for the Ba'ath Party because of al-Hawrani's presence. By this time Aflaq was losing much <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>power</b> to al-Hawrani and his supporters, who were in {{a majority in the}} party. A proof of this was the decision of the Ba'ath Party to collaborate openly with the Syrian Communist Party (SCP), a move Aflaq opposed. Aflaq was elected the party's Secretary General of the newly established National Command, a title equivalent to 'party leader', by the party's Second National Congress.|$|E
5|$|In , {{the evil}} sorcerers Quan Chi and Shang Tsung join forces {{to conquer the}} realms. By , after several fights, the sorcerers emerge victorious having killed most of Earthrealms' warriors until Raiden steps forth to oppose them. The Dragon King Onaga, who had been freed by Reptile {{at the end of}} Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance, had deceived Shujinko into searching for six pieces of Kamidogu, the source of Onaga's power. Onaga then confronted the {{alliance}} of Raiden, Shang Tsung, and Quan Chi and thus obtained Quan Chi's amulet, the final piece <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>power.</b> Only a few warriors remained to combat against the Dragon King and his forces. Shujinko eventually triumphed over the Dragon King and removed his threat to the Mortal Kombat universe.|$|E

5|$|In 1261, Alexander III, King of Scots (died 1286) sent an {{emissary}} to Norway {{to discuss}} the Isles. Negotiations proved fruitless, and the following year William I, Earl of Ross (died 1274) is recorded to have launched a vicious attack on Skye. The assault was likely carried out on behalf of Alexander, {{in response to the}} failure of Scottish mission to Norway the year previous. In response, Hákon organised a massive military force to re-assert Norwegian control along the western seaboard of Scotland. At this time, the Norwegian king was at the height <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>power,</b> and his only son had just recently been recognised as heir to the throne.|$|E
5|$|Later, Owsley's tenure {{would be}} marred by a {{conflict}} with Benjamin Hardin, his Secretary of State. Hardin believed that by supporting Owsley in the gubernatorial election, he would obtain some influence in Owsley's choices for other appointments. Tensions between Hardin and Owsley worsened as Hardin became increasingly frustrated with his lack of influence. On September 1, 1846, Owsley removed Hardin from his cabinet, charging that Hardin had abandoned his duties {{because he did not}} reside in Frankfort. Hardin challenged this premise for his removal, and when Owsley nominated George B. Kinkead to replace Hardin, the state senate voted 30—8 that no vacancy existed. The Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld this decision. Vindicated, Hardin then resigned, charging Owsley with practicing nepotism. In the Kentucky Constitution of 1850, the governor was stripped <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>power</b> to remove the Secretary of State from office.|$|E
5|$|Pain {{consolidated}} much <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>power</b> in Shropshire and Herefordshire at Bridgnorth Castle, often {{using that}} site {{as a place}} of business in preference to Shrewsbury, which had previously been the main centre of business for his predecessors as sheriff. As well as Waleran, Pain imprisoned a Welsh hostage there in 1128, Llywelyn ab Owain, the nephew of Maredudd ap Bleddyn, ruler of the Welsh principality of Powys. Besides Bridgnorth, Pain used his possession of Ludlow Castle to consolidate his power in the Welsh Marches. During Henry's reign, the Welsh border was a zone of frequent raids and conflict between the Anglo-Normans and the Welsh.|$|E

5|$|Some royal advisers, {{who were}} {{angered by the}} trust the king placed in Rosenberg, {{regarded}} him with suspicion. For example, Walter M. Gibson, the Prime Minister of Hawaii, noted that King Kalākaua withheld most of the specific details of his conversations with Rosenberg from him. Kalākaua's autocracy and nativism, along with allegations of his corruption, convinced a powerful group of western businessmen and children of Christian missionaries that action should be taken against the king. This led to the June 1887 Constitution, which stripped Kalākaua of much <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>power</b> and significantly weakened the Hawaiian monarchy.|$|E
5|$|The Undertaker {{continued}} to feud with Harvey Wippleman. On the June 12, 1993, episode of WWF Superstars of Wrestling, Wippleman, Giant Gonzalez, and Mr. Hughes attacked The Undertaker, and his manager Paul Bearer, and stole the urn {{that was said}} to be the source <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>power.</b> The Undertaker and Giant Gonzalez faced each other one final time at SummerSlam 1993 in a Rest in Peace match, in which neither wrestler could be disqualified. The Undertaker won the match to end the feud. After the match, a frustrated Gonzalez chokeslammed Wippleman to the delight of the fans and turned face in the process.|$|E
5|$|The Undertaker's {{feud with}} Harvey Wippleman {{escalated}} {{in the following}} months and was featured at two more pay-per-view events in 1993. The Undertaker faced Giant González at WrestleMania IX; González was disqualified after attacking The Undertaker with a chloroform-soaked rag provided by Wippleman. Wippleman and González recruited Mr. Hughes, and the three men attacked The Undertaker and Paul Bearer. They stole The Undertaker's urn, which {{was said to be}} the source <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>power.</b> The feud culminated in a Rest in Peace match at SummerSlam 1993, which The Undertaker won to end the feud.|$|E
