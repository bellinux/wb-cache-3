5|$|During {{the first}} Beatles' flight to America Epstein was offered {{numerous}} samples of products by merchandisers who required a licence {{to be allowed}} to sell them such as clocks, pens, plastic wigs, bracelets, and games. Epstein rejected all of them; directing the merchandisers to Byrne instead, who was already in New York ensconced in The Drake Hotel on Park Avenue at 56th Street. Byrne rented expensive offices on Fifth Avenue, hiring two limousines (on 24-hour standby) and a helicopter to fly clients to and from the airport, insisting that only the presidents of merchandising companies were allowed to talk directly with him, or with his partner, Lord Eliot, who helped to promote the company name with use of his title. Eliot would later recall going to the Seltaeb office <b>once</b> <b>or</b> <b>twice</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> to draw $1,000 from petty cash.|$|E
25|$|The overall {{strategy}} of primal therapy has hardly {{changed from the}} early days. The therapy begins with an intensive three weeks of fifteen open-ended sessions with one therapist. After this, the patient joins group meetings with other patients and therapists <b>once</b> <b>or</b> <b>twice</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> {{for as long as}} is needed. Private sessions are still available, though not every day. The length of time needed in formal therapy varies from person to person.|$|E
25|$|Sick with measles, Anna Vyrubova {{was arrested}} on 21 March 1917 and {{underwent}} five months of prison in the Peter and Paul Fortress, which included a medical examination to prove her virginity. The interrogation on her political role started on 6 May. Vyrubova admitted she saw Rasputin <b>once</b> <b>or</b> <b>twice</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> but feigned a childish innocence. The investigator concluded that she was too naïve and unintelligent to have had any influence over the Tsarina.|$|E

25|$|The choir school {{continues}} {{and although}} originally all-male, now also admits girls; a Cathedral Girls' Choir {{was founded in}} 2000 and sings <b>once</b> <b>or</b> <b>twice</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> The girls are mostly drawn from either the choir school or St Patrick's Grammar School, which provides a secondary education. It is no longer compulsory for grammar school pupils {{to be in the}} choirs, although many of the girls are, and a few boys; many of the boys leave when their voice breaks. Choirboys are considered professional singers and are paid monthly for their services. The girls are not. The choir also sings very occasionally at weddings and receive payment for this. Until 1998 they received a large discount on their education; they are still offered free music lessons. While non-choirboy students had two months' holidays during the summer, half of the boys were on duty every day during the summer and had to attend choir practice and two services each weekday, one service on Saturday and two on Sunday. This arrangement was also changed in 1998.|$|E

According to Burack's recollection, the Radzas took out their prayer book, said Kaddish, the Jewish prayer for the dead, and [...] "all thanked God {{that we were going}} to die." [...] However, the Macugowskis were able to convince the German soldiers that they should be allowed to stay on as the home's caretakers. <b>Once</b> <b>or</b> <b>twice</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> after waiting until all the German soldiers were asleep, Jozef and Stephania were able to bring a small amount of supplies for the family.|$|E
2500|$|Thiệu {{recalled}} Trí from South Korea {{and made}} him Commander of III Corps, which surrounded the capital Saigon and was crucial in blocking or orchestrating coups. Trí replaced Lieutenant Lê Nguyên Khang, a prominent Kỳ supporter. Thiệu gave orders directly to his supporters in senior positions, bypassing Trí's own superior, Cao Văn Viên. According to Creighton Abrams, the head of U.S. forces in Vietnam at the time, [...] "Tri has dinner with the President <b>once</b> <b>or</b> <b>twice</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> He gets operational approval, that sort of thing, and Viên's not in on that". Although Trí and Kỳ often crossed paths at official functions thereafter, they never shook hands.|$|E
2500|$|A {{supervision}} order {{is designed to}} stop young people from re-offending; however it is a much stricter, and longer lasting order than a reparation. A Supervising Officer from the YOT {{is attached to the}} young person’s case and provides support and advice as the offender completes the referral and {{supervision order}}. As with the reparation order, appointments must be kept (<b>once</b> <b>or</b> <b>twice</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> for {{the first three months of}} the order, and then weeks for the second three months, and fortnightly after that) and the young person must maintain a respectful and cooperative attitude. [...] When the order is at least half complete and if the young person has made good progress, the supervision order may be returned to the court for early revocation.|$|E

2500|$|Braudel and Reynold {{have made}} a {{systematic}} study of these European market towns between the thirteenth and fifteenth century. [...] Their investigation shows that in regional districts markets were held <b>once</b> <b>or</b> <b>twice</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> while daily markets were common in larger cities. Gradually over time, permanent shops with regular trading days began to supplant the periodic markets, while peddlers filled in the gaps in distribution. The physical market was characterised by transactional exchange and the economy was characterised by local trading. Braudel reports that, in 1600, goods travelled relatively short distances– grain 5–10 miles; cattle 40–70 miles; wool and wollen cloth 20–40 miles. Following the European age of discovery, goods were imported from afar– calico cloth from India, porcelain, silk and tea from China, spices from India and South-East Asia and tobacco, sugar, rum [...] and coffee from the New World.|$|E
