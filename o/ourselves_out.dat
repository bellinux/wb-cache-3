5|$|Sir Boyle Roche, 1st Baronet (October 1736 – 5 June 1807) was an Irish politician. After a {{distinguished}} career in North America with the British Army, Roche {{became a member}} of the Irish House of Commons in 1775, generally acting in support of the viceregal government. He is better remembered for the language of his speeches than his politicsthey were riddled with mixed metaphors ("Mr Speaker, I smell a rat; I see him forming in the air and darkening the sky; but I'll nip him in the bud"), malapropisms and other unfortunate turns of phrase ("Why we should put <b>ourselves</b> <b>out</b> of our way to do anything for posterity, for what has posterity ever done for us?"). Roche may have been Richard Brinsley Sheridan's model for Mrs Malaprop.|$|E
500|$|The band {{decided to}} forgo working with Butch Vig, who had {{produced}} the group's previous albums, and selected Flood and Alan Moulder as co-producers. Corgan explained, [...] "To be completely honest, I {{think it was}} a situation where we'd become so close to Butch that it started to work to our disadvantage... I just felt we had to force the situation, sonically, and take <b>ourselves</b> <b>out</b> of normal Pumpkin recording mode. I didn't want to repeat past Pumpkin work." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{discovering}} {{they were}} £60,000 in debt, Blur toured the United States in 1992 {{in an attempt}} to recoup their financial losses. The group released the single [...] "Popscene" [...] to coincide with the start of the tour. Featuring [...] "a rush of punk guitars, '60s pop hooks, blaring British horns, controlled fury, and postmodern humor", [...] "Popscene" [...] was a turning point for the band musically. However, upon its release it only charted at number 32. [...] "We felt 'Popscene' was a big departure; a very, very English record", Albarn told the NME in 1993, [...] "But that annoyed a lot of people ... We put <b>ourselves</b> <b>out</b> on a limb to pursue this English ideal and no-one was interested." [...] As a result of the single's lacklustre performance, plans to release a single named [...] "Never Clever" [...] were scrapped and work on Blur's second album was pushed back.|$|E

2500|$|One {{significant}} {{debate in}} Wittgenstein scholarship concerns {{the work of}} interpreters who are referred to {{under the banner of}} The New Wittgenstein school such as Cora Diamond, Alice Crary, and James F. Conant. [...] While the Tractatus, particularly in its conclusion, seems paradoxical and self-undermining, New Wittgenstein scholars advance a [...] "therapeutic" [...] understanding of Wittgenstein's work—"an understanding of Wittgenstein as aspiring, not to advance metaphysical theories, but rather to help us work <b>ourselves</b> <b>out</b> of confusions we become entangled in when philosophizing." [...] To support this goal, the New Wittgenstein scholars propose a reading of the Tractatus as [...] "plain nonsense"—arguing it does not attempt to convey a substantive philosophical project but instead simply tries to push the reader to abandon philosophical speculation. The therapeutic approach traces its roots to the philosophical work of John Wisdom and the review of The Blue Book written by Oets Kolk Bouwsma.|$|E
2500|$|On 8 March 1932, Puyi {{made his}} {{ceremonial}} entry into Changchun, sharing his car with Zheng who was beaming with joy, Amakasu whose expression was stern as usual, and Wanrong, who looked miserable. Puyi remembered about {{his first time}} in Changchun: [...] "I saw Japanese gendarmes, and rows of people, wearing all sots of clothes; some were in Chinese jackets and gowns, some were in Western suits and some in traditional Japanese dress, {{and they were all}} holding small flags in their hands. I was thrilled and reflected that I was now seeing the scene that I missed at the harbor. As I walked past them Hsi Hsia [...] pointed out a line of dragon flags between the Japanese ones and said that the men holding them were all Manchu [...] "bannermen" [...] who had been waiting for me to come for twenty years. These words brought tears to my eyes, and I was more strongly convinced than ever that my future was very hopeful". Puyi also noted he was [...] "too preoccupied with my hopes and hates" [...] to realize the [...] "cold comfort that the Changchun citizens, silent from terror and hatred, were giving me". Puyi's friend, the British journalist Woodhead, who covered his arrival in Manchuria, wrote [...] "outside official circles, I met no Chinese who felt any enthusiasm for the new regime", and that the city of Harbin was being terrorized by Chinese and Russian gangsters working for the Japanese, making Harbin [...] "lawless... even its main street unsafe after dark". In an interview with Woodhead, Puyi stated he planned to govern Manchukuo “in the Confucian spirit” and he was “perfectly happy” with his new position. An Italian journalist from the Corriere della Sera newspaper wrote: “I was unable to interview this pale, tired prince who doesn’t’ like to talk, who is always plunged in his meditations and who maybe regrets his life as a simple, studious citizen. He has a fixed stare behind his black-framed glasses. When we were introduced, he responded with a friendly nod. But his smile lasted only a second. We could only await the word of the Master of Ceremonies to give us permission to bow <b>ourselves</b> <b>out.</b> A Japanese colonel, our guide, showed us the triumphal arches, the electric light decorations and endless flags. But all this, say the shopkeepers is [...] "made in Osaka"”.|$|E
