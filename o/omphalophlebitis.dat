40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} whether epidural administration of a xylazine-lidocaine combination accompanied by xylazine sedation would provide satisfactory analgesia for some surgical procedures on 10 calves admitted to the Department of Veterinary Surgery, University of Kafkas with perineal urolithiasis (n: 2), rectovaginal fistula (n: 1), atresia ani (n: 2), <b>omphalophlebitis</b> (n: 2), omphaloarteritis (n: 1) and umbilical hernia (n: 2). Following intramuscular injection of xylazine at a dose of 0. 05 mg/kg for sedation, xylazine-lidocaine combination (0. 2 mg/kg lidocaine + 0. 02 mg/kg xylazine + 5 ml 0. 9 % NaCl) was administrated into the lumbosacral (L 6 -S 1), sacrococcygeal (S 5 -Co 1) or intercoccygeal (Co 1 -Co 2) space. Heart rate, respiratory rate and rectal temperature were recorded prior to and during analgesia at 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes. Furthermore, depth and duration of analgesia were evaluated during surgical intervention. The study revealed that the combination of epidural xylazine-lidocaine with xylazine sedation was highly satisfactory for surgery of the lower urinary tract and the perineal region, but it was less so for surgery of the umbilical area. </p...|$|E
40|$|Alguns problemas têm sido observados nos bezerros produtos da técnica fertilização {{in vitro}}, dentre esses a elevada casuística de onfalopatias. A partir dessa observação, objetivou-se com este trabalho realizar um estudo retrospectivo da correlação entre os métodos de concepção e a ocorrência de onfalopatias em bovinos e descrever os resultados obtidos a partir dos tratamentos conservativo e cirúrgico. Foram utilizados 44 bovinos atendidos no Hospital Veterinário da Unesp, Campus de Araçatuba, com idade variando de um dia a 12 meses entre os anos de 2003 e 2007. Desses bovinos 27 eram provenientes de fertilização in vitro (FIV), 12 de inseminação {{artificial}} (IA), dois de monta natural (MN) e três de transferência de embriões (TE). O diagnóstico clínico-cirúrgico revelou que todos apresentavam afecções umbilicais, sendo 22 casos de persistência de úraco, oito de onfaloflebite, oito de hérnias umbilicais, cinco de onfalites e um de fibrose umbilical. Inicialmente e no pós-operatório administrou-se em todos os animais, uma vez ao dia, durante dez dias, 3 mg/kg de ceftiofur sódico pela via intravenosa (IV). Nos casos de infecção grave ou irresponsiva a terapia antimicrobiana inicial, acrescentou-se 6, 6 mg/kg, durante sete dias de sulfato de gentamicina IV. A antissepsia do umbigo, com tintura de iodo a 2 %, foi instituída duas vezes ao dia, nos casos tratados conservativamente, enquanto que os bovinos submetidos à cirurgia receberam 1, 1 mg/kg de flunixin meglumine IV, uma vez ao dia, por cinco dias consecutivos. Dos 22 animais diagnosticados com persistência de úraco, 10 apresentavam drenagem de urina pelo umbigo e receberam 2 mL de tintura de iodo 10 % no interior do úraco, sendo 15 tratados com a excisão cirúrgica, especialmente, devido à formação de divertículo vésico-uracal. Todos os animais que apresentavam onfaloflebite e hérnia umbilical foram submetidos à cirurgia. Já dos cinco casos de onfalite, três foram tratados conservativamente. A análise dos diferentes métodos de concepção, correlacionados à ocorrência de onfalopatias, sugere que os animais provenientes de FIV, apresentam maior frequência de persistência de úraco (66, 7 %), e aqueles concebidos por IA, maior frequência de hérnia umbilical (58, 4 %), O tratamento cirúrgico foi mais eficiente que a terapia conservativa. Essa última apresentou melhores resultados nos casos descomplicados e precocemente diagnosticados. Some {{problems have been}} observed in bovine products of the in vitro fertilization technical, among these, the high umbilical diseases casuistry. From this observation, {{the aim of this}} work was to accomplish a retrospective study of the correlation between the conception methods and the occurrence of umbilical diseases in bovines and describe the results obtained from the conservative and surgical treatments. For this 44 animals attended at Veterinary Teaching Hospital of Unesp Araçatuba, with age varying from one day to 12 months among the years of 2003 and 2007 were used, twenty seven were from in vitro fertilization (IVF), twelve were from artificial insemination (AI), two were from natural mounts and three were from embryo transfer. The clinical-surgical diagnosis of the animals revealed that all of them presented umbilical disorders, being 22 cases of urachus patent, eight <b>omphalophlebitis,</b> eight umbilical hernia, five omphalitis and one umbilical fibrosis. Before and at the postoperative period was administered in all animals once a day for ten days 3 mg/kg of ceftiofur sodium IV. In cases of serious infection or lack of response of the initial antimicrobial therapy a complementary treatment during seven days with 6. 6 mg/kg of gentamicin sulfate IV was carried out. The antisepsis of the umbilicus with tincture of iodine to 2 % was carried out twice daily in cases treated clinically, with out surgery, while the animals underwent surgery received 1. 1 mg/kg of flunixin meglumine IV once daily for five consecutive days. Among the 22 animals diagnosed with urachus patent, 10 had urine drainage from the umbilicus and received 2 mL of 10 % tincture of iodine in the urachus, and 15 was treated with surgical excision, due to formation of diverticulum from the blader to urachus. All animals that were affected with <b>omphalophlebitis</b> and umbilical hernia were submitted to surgery and already of the five cases of omphalitis, three were treated clinically. The analysis of different conception methods correlated to the umbilical diseases occurrence showed evidences that in this retrospective study, the animals from IVF have a higher frequency of the urachus patent (66. 7 %), and animals designed to AI observed higher frequency of umbilical hernia (58. 4 %). There is high correlation between the IVF and the occurrence of umbilical diseases in calves and the conservative therapy was effective in less complicated cases and quickly identified, while the surgical treatment showed better results in the cases studied...|$|E
40|$|The {{appropriate}} {{management and}} disposal of feces and urine derived from goat production systems can help minimize {{the environmental impact of}} the activity reflecting in animal welfare, good sanitary conditions, viable indexes and increase revenue by aggregating the activity value of the manure generated. Aiming to take advantage of zootechnical installation already used for the manure in rabbits’ husbandry, it was carried out the suitability of a 15. 40 m² pen (5. 7 x 2. 7 meters, filled with dirt) in the goat rearing of UPD Itapetininga/APTA-SAA being deployed on slatted floor system for capturing and processing goat manure. It was dug in the floor of the bay rectangular holes with 15 m² of surface and 80 cm of depth for capturing of the excrements, filled with layers of gravel (0. 20 m), coal (0. 20 m), medium sand (0, 15 m) and clay (0. 05 m) being the surface in direct contact with feces and urine. The gap of 40 cm between the back of the slatted floor and the last layer allowed the accumulation of manure during the occupation of the stall. We used the pens for 10 consecutive months for the management of newly calved Saanen and crossbred Saanen/Boer goats for 10 to 15 days postpartum in controlled feeding and termination of 27 confined kids. The maintenance of the collection system and treatment of manure was done through constant sweeps in the slatted floor and periodical aplication of 30 g of superphosphate per m² directly in feces, in order to acidifying the compound. This measure contributed to the ambience and animal comfort, controlling flies and neutralizing odors and harmful actions of ammonia coming from the urine. To carry out the sanitary break in the stall, needed for new production cycle, the frames of the slatted floor were raised and about 2500 kg of manure was removed, followed by cleaning and disinfection of floors and pillars of support and rest for 45 days unused until the entry of the new batch of goats recently calved. Using this new manure system we observed great decrease in the occurrence of typical confined kids diseases, like diarrhea, pneumonia and <b>omphalophlebitis,</b> and lower overall mortality rate until slaughter when compared with goats reared in pens with dirt and litter. The investment for installation of the system was assessed $ 722. 50 (U. S. $ 48. 16 /m²). Considering the potential use of the stall, placing 10 adult animals (1. 5 m²/head), with average production of the adult animal of 600 kg of manure/year, can be obtained easily, 6000 kg of manure, with average price of $ 0. 13 /kg., which could revert to $ 780. 00 /production cycle, this feature would pay the investment in about two years. In order to improve the investment cost it can be used in the construction of treated pine wooden pallets, in view of durability, ease of working wood and the lowest price. In order to facilitate a return on investment, can be treated pine used in the construction of wooden pallets, in view of its durability, workability and lower price, which can replace other more expensive types of wood, with the same efficiency and advantage of being lighter, which facilitates the management and operational cleaning of pallets. Furthermore, the capture system can be strong allies on the aggregation of producers of small ruminants, increasing the production of humus, energy source for anaerobic digesters, manure crops and organic manure use in integrated agriculture systems, pastures and forest. The validated system made possible the manpower needed to maintain the stall tested, improving the management and performance of goats, other income generating activities for productive and sustainable...|$|E
