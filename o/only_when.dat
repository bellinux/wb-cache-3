It is not albinism, pigment being evident in the white tiger's stripes and in their blue eyes. The causative mutation changes a single amino acid in the transporter protein SLC45A2.|$|E

The deranged protein metabolism leads to the accumulation of waste products such as ammonia in the bloodstream. When these irritate the brain, the person develops hepatic encephalopathy (confusion, coma, seizures and finally life-threatening swelling of the brain).|$|E

Some have gentle dispositions and bite <b>only</b> <b>when</b> provoked, but others are much more aggressive. Currently, 17genera are described as sea snakes, comprising 62 species.|$|E
