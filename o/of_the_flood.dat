5|$|After {{the success}} of the first Halo novel, , {{publisher}} Del Rey and Halo publisher Microsoft signed a deal for new books based on Xbox games, including another entry in the Halo series. Del Ray approached author Dietz to write the next book. Dietz incorporated his first-hand experience in the military for the additional scenes <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Flood</b> not found in the game.|$|E
5|$|Consistent {{with this}} perspective, geochemical mapping made from orbit {{suggests}} the crust of mostly anorthosite. The Moon rock samples <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> lavas that erupted {{onto the surface}} from partial melting in the mantle confirm the mafic mantle composition, which is more iron rich than that of Earth.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Carla, Texas' largest {{storm on}} record, struck the coast in 1961 causing {{substantial}} flooding and damage in Texas City and other communities. Loss {{of life was}} minimal thanks to evacuation efforts. Expansion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> control dike and construction on the Texas City seawall occurred a result. The project was completed in 1985.|$|E

5|$|The player's {{discovery}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flood</b> in Halo: Combat Evolved {{is a major}} plot twist, {{and was one of}} the surprises reviewers noted positively upon release. The Flood's {{return in}} Halo2 and Halo3 was less enthusiastically praised. Reaction to the Flood has varied over the years; while some found the Flood too derivative and a cliché element of science fiction, some others ranked them among the greatest villains of all time.|$|E
5|$|Though Nenana also {{received}} heavy rain {{from the storm}} system that began the flood, its position further downstream on the Tanana River meant {{that it did not}} receive the first effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> until the 30th, when Alaska Railroad officials suspended operations south of Nenana due to track damage caused by rising water.|$|E
5|$|A {{secondary}} {{enemy is}} the Flood, a parasitic alien life form {{that appears in}} three main variants. Infection Forms, the true form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flood,</b> are fragile beings and do little damage individually, but often travel in swarms of several dozen in order to infect their prey. Combat Forms result from humans and Covenant Elites who have succumbed to the Infection Forms, and have hideously deformed bodies as a result. Bloated Carrier Forms {{are the result of}} an aged or unused Combat Form and serve as incubators for new Infection Forms; when wounded or near a potential victim, they explode to damage other nearby life-forms and to release their spores, thus perpetuating the Flood life cycle.|$|E

5|$|After nearly 50,000cars were flooded and ruined, {{many people}} {{attempted}} {{to sell the}} cars across the country without telling of the car's history. Following the extreme flooding, a mosquito outbreak occurred, though FEMA provided aid to control the problem. Health officials also recommended disinfecting private wells with bleach, due to possible contamination from the severe flooding. Many people took advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> victims, including fraudulent contractors and suppliers raising the price of goods more than is actually justified.|$|E
5|$|Despite all the improvements, serious {{flooding}} {{occurred in}} 1999 when {{the bank of}} the drain was breached near Pinchbeck. Staff from the Environment Agency and the Black Sluice Internal Drainage Board successfully repaired the breach before properties were flooded, and a review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> defences was then carried out. The report recommended improvements to some of the banks, but funding for the work was not available, and so no work was done at the time.|$|E
5|$|Economic {{stability}} {{returned with}} the U.S. entry into World War II in 1941, when demand for the state's agricultural and industrial products grew as the nation mobilized for war. In 1944, the Pick–Sloan Plan was passed as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flood</b> Control Act of 1944 by the U.S. Congress, resulting {{in the construction of}} six large dams on the Missouri River, four of which are at least partially in South Dakota. Flood control, hydroelectricity, and recreational opportunities such as boating and fishing are provided by the dams and their reservoirs.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the game, the Covenant pursue, {{damaging}} the Autumn and leading its crew to wage a guerrilla war on the ring's surface. The Covenant accidentally release Flood imprisoned on the ring; to nullify the threat, the ring's AI caretaker, 343 Guilty Spark, enlists the help of the Master Chief in activating Halo. Cortana reveals that Halo's activation would mean their own destruction. Master Chief and Cortana instead detonate Autumns engines, destroying Halo and preventing the escape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flood.</b>|$|E
5|$|SR54 was {{extended}} west as a freeway to I-5 from I-805 {{at the same}} time the Sweetwater River flood control channel was built; the state proposed routing the flood channel in between the two roadways of the freeway in 1963, and it would also delineate the boundary between the cities of Chula Vista and National City. Later that year, the county proposed an extension of the freeway east to US80 and Third Street in El Cajon. In 1966, the U.S. Army's Board of Engineers supported the construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> channel, to protect future development in the surrounding region from flooding; the integration of SR54 was included in the proposal.|$|E
5|$|Several hundred {{homes were}} {{inundated}} by the flood in Fairbanks, Salcha, unincorporated Fairbanks North Star Borough, Nenana, and smaller villages, {{but due to}} early warnings from the National Weather Service, volunteer fire departments, and the borough's emergency contact system, no one was injured. The area affected by the flood was declared a state disaster area, making residents whose homes were flooded eligible for state aid. The long-term effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flood,</b> including {{its effect on the}} salmon spawning season, are as yet unknown.|$|E

5|$|The Flood {{have been}} {{featured}} in four series of Halo action figures, produced by Joyride Studios. For Halo: Combat Evolved, Joyride produced a Carrier Form and Infection form bundle. Halo2s series contains both a human Combat Form and Infection form (bundled with the Master Chief), which were released after the video game. Reviewer Aaron Simmer of Armchair Empire.com expressed the sentiment that Joyride's models could not totally capture the ghoulishness texture and detail <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flood.</b> The action figures for Halo 3 were produced by McFarlane Toys and although the first series did not feature the Flood, the third series featured a human Combat Form.|$|E
5|$|The Rivers Agency {{concluded}} that the flooding was an extreme event, caused by weather that resulted in widespread flooding across Northern Ireland. The amount {{of water in the}} rivers exceeded the capacity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> defences and the natural river banks. They further {{concluded that}} the flooding was a result of overflow of the Shimna River into the Burren River catchment area through Islands Park, rather than from the Burren River itself.|$|E
5|$|The {{first section}} of the freeway opened in 1963, east of I-805. The {{extension}} of the freeway west to I-5 was delayed in order {{to coincide with the}} construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> channel for the Sweetwater River. While construction started in 1984, a court stopped the process for a few years, and this portion was not complete until 1992. The final section of freeway, which was upgraded from an expressway, opened in 2007, to coincide with the extension of SR125 south to Otay Mesa.|$|E

5|$|The release <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flood</b> prompts Halo's AI monitor, 343 Guilty Spark, {{to recruit}} Master Chief in {{retrieving}} the Index, {{a device that}} will activate Halo and prevent the Flood from spreading beyond the facility. After Master Chief retrieves and prepares to use the Index, Cortana re-appears and warns him against the activation. She has discovered that Halo's defense system is a weapon designed to kill all sentient life in the galaxy, which will deny the host bodies the Flood requires to spread, a revelation which Guilty Spark confirms.|$|E
5|$|While the Chief and Cortana {{head to the}} Autumn, Alpha Base is evacuated. Silva {{decides to}} retake the Truth and Reconciliation and pilot the ship away {{in order to avoid}} being on Halo when the Autumn blows. The ship is taken successfully, but McKay realizes that Silva is blinded by the thought of {{promotion}} and glory to the danger of the Flood; if even one Flood specimen escaped containment on Earth, the entire planet could fall. Jenkins draws McKay's attention to a vital energy line on the ship, and realizing that the destruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flood</b> is more important than Silva's promotion, cuts the cable, sending the Truth and Reconciliation crashing into Halo, killing all aboard.|$|E
5|$|After the Deluge, {{also known}} as The Forty-First Day, is a Symbolist oil {{painting}} by English artist George Frederic Watts, first exhibited as The Sun in an incomplete form in 1886 and completed in 1891. It shows {{a scene from the}} story of Noah's Flood, in which after 40 days of rain Noah opens the window of his Ark to see that the rain has stopped. Watts felt that modern society was in decline owing to a lack of moral values, and he often painted works on the topic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flood</b> and its cleansing of the unworthy from the world. The painting {{takes the form of a}} stylised seascape, dominated by a bright sunburst breaking through clouds. Although this was a theme Watts had depicted previously in The Genius of Greek Poetry in 1878, After the Deluge took a radically different approach. With this painting he intended to evoke a monotheistic God in the act of creation, but avoid depicting the Creator directly.|$|E
