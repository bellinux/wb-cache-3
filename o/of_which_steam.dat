60|$|What a line we have traced! Long {{enough to}} go round the world if it were straight. A line of holes out <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>steam,</b> and heat, and cinders, and melted stones are rushing up, perpetually, {{in one place and}} another. Now the holes in this line which are near each other have {{certainly}} something to do with each other. For instance, when the earth shook the other day round the volcanos of Quito, it shook also round the volcanos of Peru, though they were 600 miles away. And there are many stories of earthquakes being felt, or awful underground thunder heard, while volcanos were breaking out hundreds of miles away. I will give you a very curious instance of that.|$|E
5000|$|Tom Varley was a {{collector}} of steam-powered road vehicles, {{known for the}} Tom Varley Collection, a steam museum mostly of steam wagons, [...] "a lasting legacy <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>steam</b> road enthusiasts can be proud".|$|E
50|$|Fixing or “kill-green” {{refers to}} the process by <b>which</b> enzymatic {{browning}} <b>of</b> the wilted leaves is controlled {{through the application of}} heat. It is held that the longer it takes to fix the leaves, the more aromatic will be the tea. Fixing is carried out via steaming, pan firing, baking or with the use of heated tumblers. Application of steam heats the leaves more quickly that pan firing, as a result <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>steamed</b> teas taste ‘green’ and vegetal while the pan-fired ones taste toasty. This procedure is carried out for green teas and yellow teas.|$|R
50|$|The railway has 6 locomotives, two <b>of</b> <b>which</b> are <b>steam</b> {{and built}} by Herbert Bullock in the 1930s. The railway also {{operates}} 3 miniature vehicles (two buses and a fire engine) which give rides to children along the Arbroath seafront.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{historically}} most valuable exhibits is {{the staff of}} the railway line from Ballaghaderreen to Kilfree Junction, the last piece <b>of</b> track on <b>which</b> <b>steam</b> locomotive were still be used, until it was closed in 1963.|$|R
50|$|The quality <b>of</b> <b>steam</b> on <b>which</b> <b>steam</b> {{whistles}} are blown is {{variable and}} may affect frequency. Steam quality determines the velocity <b>of</b> sound, <b>which</b> declines with decreasing dryness {{due to the}} inertia of the liquid phase. Also, the specific volume of steam for a given temperature decreases with decreasing dryness.|$|R
5000|$|Ships {{were built}} larger to carry bulk cargoes more efficiently, their rigs were {{simplified}} to reduce manning costs and speed {{was no longer}} a premium. Owners shipped cargoes that were non-perishable so that their date <b>of</b> arrival (<b>which</b> <b>steam</b> ships had started to guarantee) were of less importance. Finally as the Panama Canal was opened, sailing ships were used in parts of the world where steam ships still found it hard to operate: principally on ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{steam whistle}} is a device {{used to produce}} sound with the aid <b>of</b> live <b>steam,</b> <b>which</b> acts as a {{vibrating}} system [...] (compare to train horn).|$|R
6000|$|... "There is the sulphur spring, sir," [...] said Pierce, {{pointing}} {{towards a}} delicate strand <b>of</b> <b>steam</b> <b>which</b> rose from {{a clump of}} pines in the second basin beneath them.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of {{a view of}} oil {{derricks}} {{along the}} coast of Playa del Rey in Venice, showing storage tanks and many low buildings, ca. 1925. Many tall oil derricks line the visible length of the coastline. Clusters of low buildings sit in front of the derricks, along with cylindrical tanks and other structures, some <b>of</b> <b>which</b> emit <b>steam</b> or smoke. The ocean's edge fills the foreground of the image...|$|R
5000|$|Routine was {{interrupted}} by occasional special tasks, the most notable <b>of</b> <b>which</b> came in June 1927. Goff was part <b>of</b> the flotilla <b>which</b> <b>steamed</b> out from the East Coast to greet and escort [...] and her special passenger, Charles Lindbergh, as he returned from his transatlantic flight to a hero's welcome in New York. Goff also in June 1930 carried the President-elect of Colombia from Newport, Rhode Island to West Point. She decommissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 13 January 1931.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{it is not}} alive. It is dead. It is that," [...] {{he pointed}} with {{emphasis}} to a pot hanging over the lamp out <b>of</b> <b>which</b> a little <b>steam</b> was issuing, {{and looked at his}} mother with awful solemnity. She returned the look with something of incredulity.|$|R
50|$|As his {{experience}} grew, he realised that improvements in boiler technology now permitted the safe production <b>of</b> high-pressure <b>steam,</b> <b>which</b> could move a piston in a steam engine {{on its own}} account, instead of using pressure near to atmospheric in a condensing engine.|$|R
50|$|Any {{turbomachine}} extracts {{energy from}} high-pressure steam and converts it into shaft work. The total energy content available in steam supplied to the steam turbine {{is not completely}} recovered {{in the form of}} mechanical energy. There are certain losses in energy <b>of</b> <b>steam</b> <b>which</b> occur inside a turbine...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Three of the {{reactors}} at Fukushima I overheated because the cooling systems failed after a tsunami flooded the power station, causing core meltdowns. This {{was compounded by}} hydrogen gas explosions and the venting <b>of</b> contaminated <b>steam</b> <b>which</b> released large amounts of radioactive material into the air.|$|R
60|$|The Atlantic Ocean now sprang {{into new}} life. It seemed {{impossible}} to imagine whence had come the multitude <b>of</b> vessels <b>which</b> now <b>steamed</b> and sailed upon its surface. Among these, going westward, were six crabs, and the spring-armoured vessel, once the Tallapoosa, going home to a triumphant reception, such as {{had never before been}} accorded to any vessel, whether of war or peace.|$|R
25|$|On 31 January 1863, Keystone State {{opened fire}} on a ship off Charleston. It {{returned}} fire, scoring hits on Keystone State, one <b>of</b> <b>which</b> struck her <b>steam</b> drum, rupturing it and scalding 20 men to death and injuring 20 others. After repairs, Keystone State took up a blockading station off St. Simons Sound, Georgia.|$|R
50|$|Shipping has {{traditionally}} been a key sector in the Greek economy since ancient times. In 1813, the Greek merchant navy {{was made up of}} 615 ships. Its total tonnage was 153,580 tons and was manned with 37,526 crewmembers and 5,878 cannons. In 1914 the figures stood at 449,430 tons and 1,322 ships (<b>of</b> <b>which</b> 287 were <b>steam</b> boats).|$|R
5000|$|The {{industrial}} estate of LIAZ {{has also been}} used for production <b>of</b> <b>steam</b> <b>which</b> is routinely used to heat housing estates. This highly presurised steam is piped to smaller transformer stations round the town of Jablonec nad Nisou. In the transformer stations, the pressure is reduced and used for heating blocks of flats.|$|R
60|$|In No. 3 of my {{new book}} I have been blowing off a little <b>of</b> indignant <b>steam</b> <b>which</b> would {{otherwise}} blow me up, and with God's leave I shall walk in the same all the days of my life; but I have no present political faith or hope--not a grain.|$|R
60|$|The {{engine room}} {{was full of}} steam, so that for the moment Dick could see little. A pipe running along {{one side of the}} engine had burst, and Tom was hemmed in a corner. To get out he would have to pass through the furious outpouring <b>of</b> <b>steam,</b> <b>which</b> might scald him to death.|$|R
60|$|Both pretty noses sniffed {{and sniffed}} {{again as the}} girls bent over the pan, {{regardless}} <b>of</b> the <b>steam</b> <b>which</b> was ruining their crimps and reddening their noses. Reluctantly, Patty owned that a slight flavor of scorch did pervade the air, but suggested that a touch more seasoning would conceal the sad fact.|$|R
25|$|For {{use on the}} Pockerley Waggonway, {{the museum}} has three replicas of early steam locomotives, {{completed}} in 1975 (Locomotion No. 1), 2002 (Steam Elephant) and 2006 (Puffing Billy), all <b>of</b> <b>which</b> can be <b>steamed</b> (but with only one usually in service on any given day): An original locomotive, the 1850s Hetton Lyon, is a static exhibit in the Great Shed.|$|R
50|$|The {{mountain}} {{was first}} climbed by J. C. Bidwill in March 1839, the ascent being from the north-west. He reported that “The crater {{was the most}} terrific abyss I ever looked into or imagined … {{it was not possible}} to see above 10 yards into it from the quantity <b>of</b> <b>steam</b> <b>which</b> it was continually discharging”.|$|R
60|$|Among these {{disturbing}} influences, the Gulf Stream is a {{very important}} one. It is constantly sending up large volumes <b>of</b> <b>steam,</b> <b>which,</b> rising into the air, induce a flow of wind from both sides towards its centre. And many of the storms that arise {{in other parts of the}} Atlantic make for this stream, and follow its course.|$|R
50|$|BR {{inherited}} {{more than}} 20,000 locomotives from the constituent Big Four companies, {{the vast majority}} <b>of</b> <b>which</b> were <b>steam</b> locomotives. BR built 2537 steam locomotives in the period 1948-1960: 1538 were to pre-nationalisation designs, and 999 to its own standard designs. These locomotives were destined to lead short lives, some as little as five years against a design life of over 30 years, because {{of the end of}} steam traction on 11 August 1968. The exceptions were locomotives No. 98007-98009 which continued to work the Vale of Rheidol line for British Rail until it was sold in 1989. They remain in operation on the privately owned heritage railway.|$|R
50|$|A popcorn kernel's strong hull {{contains}} the seed's hard, starchy endosperm with 14-15% moisture, the latter <b>of</b> <b>which</b> turns to <b>steam</b> as the kernel is heated. The pressure continues building until it exceeds the hull's ability to contain it. The kernel ruptures and explodes, allowing the contents to expand, cool, and finally {{set in a}} popcorn puff 20 to 50 {{times the size of}} the original kernel.|$|R
50|$|The {{greatest}} recorded eruptions {{occurred between}} 1730 and 1736. The volcanic activity continues as the surface {{temperature in the}} core ranges from 100 to 600 C at the depth <b>of</b> 13 m, <b>which</b> is demonstrated by pouring water into the ground, resulting in a geyser <b>of</b> <b>steam</b> <b>which</b> is an attraction for tourists. There is only one active volcano, Timanfaya volcano which the park is named after.|$|R
50|$|A {{major portion}} of Keenan’s career was devoted to the {{development}} of accurate tables of the properties <b>of</b> <b>steam,</b> <b>which</b> are vital to the electric power industry. In 1929, he was appointed the U.S. delegate to the First International Conference on the Properties of Steam; he served as delegate in all successive conferences on this subject through the eighth in 1974.|$|R
5000|$|In 1856, a {{surveyor}} {{described the}} wharf as [...] "not a properly built wharf, but {{more of an}} earth bank". Associated facilities included a shed enclosed on one side with bark near the river, a slab and shingle wool store higher up the bank, a wooden slide down to the wharf from the store, and a road [...] "cut into the bank and made with stone". By 1861, wool presses, at least one <b>of</b> <b>which</b> was <b>steam</b> powered, were located {{on either side of}} the stores fronting Bremer Street. A steam-powered cotton gin was added, probably in early 1862. Gray also had a store on the corner of Bell and Bremer Streets.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to optical fiber amplifier-lasers, a large variety of medical applications (i.e. dermatology, dentistry) {{rely on the}} erbium ion's [...] emission (see Er:YAG laser), which is highly absorbed in water in tissues, making its effect very superficial. Such shallow tissue deposition of laser energy is helpful in laser surgery, and for the efficient production <b>of</b> <b>steam</b> <b>which</b> produces enamel ablation by common types of dental laser.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the 20th {{century and}} {{beginning}} of the 21st century a number of combined cycle gas turbine power stations were built (see also dash for gas), some <b>of</b> <b>which</b> utilised 'waste' <b>steam</b> to provide nearby petroleum and chemical plants with heat energy. During the same time frame a large area of former clay workings from earlier brick and tile activity was converted into water parks in the Barton area.|$|R
50|$|From the 1920s the {{locomotive}} fleet comprised about 7 permanent locomotives, painted green with yellow outline stripes. From 1926 {{there were also}} diesel locomotives. The Forest Railway had a total of 12 locomotives, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> 5 were <b>steam,</b> 4 were diesel und 3 petrol-electric locos. At the peak of operations in 1932 it had 355 log wagons (Trucks) and 47 other wagons. In winter railway traffic ceased due {{to the amount of}} snow.|$|R
50|$|As {{for their}} shape and texture, {{they can come}} in various sizes, from 4 to 12 in, and are most {{commonly}} semicircular. They consist of a pocket of dough filled with varying amounts of melted mozzarella cheese, tomato sauce and any reasonable number <b>of</b> fillings, <b>which</b> is then wrapped, salted and deep-fried. Panzerotto rises during this process, creating a pocket containing a considerable amount <b>of</b> <b>steam</b> <b>which</b> should be partially released prior to eating.|$|R
50|$|In the Royal Navy, the sloop {{evolved into}} an unrated vessel {{with a single}} gun deck and three masts, two square rigged and the aftermost fore-and-aft rigged (corvettes had three masts, all <b>of</b> <b>which</b> were square-rigged). <b>Steam</b> sloops had a {{transverse}} division of their lateral coal bunkers in order that the lower division could be emptied first, to maintain a level of protection afforded by the coal in the upper bunker division along the waterline.|$|R
2500|$|... 05:30: Despite {{the high}} risk of {{hydrogen}} (produced from {{the water in the}} containment vessel) igniting after combining with oxygen from water or in the atmosphere, and in order to release some of the pressure inside the reactor at Fukushima I unit 1, the decision is taken to vent some <b>of</b> the <b>steam</b> (<b>which</b> contained a small amount of radioactive material) into the air.|$|R
