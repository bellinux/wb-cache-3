She then began further studies in Europe, travelling to Berlin, Vienna, Paris, and London. During this time Morton took courses, observed surgeries, and wrote a number of scientific papers including several comparing the health <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>men.</b> Following the advice of her instructor in London, Victor Horsley, she then travelled to the British Government Laboratory in Mumbai for six months to work on prophylactics against the bubonic plague as well as a period in Sri Lanka.|$|E
5|$|Christian {{feminism}} is {{a branch of}} feminist theology which seeks to interpret and understand Christianity {{in light of the}} equality <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>men,</b> and that this interpretation is necessary for a complete understanding of Christianity. While there is no standard set of beliefs among Christian feminists, most agree that God does not discriminate on the basis of sex, and are involved in issues such as the ordination of women, male dominance and the balance of parenting in Christian marriage, claims of moral deficiency and inferiority of women compared to men, and the overall treatment of women in the church. The Christian Bible refers to women in positions of authority in Judges 4:4 and Kings 22:14.|$|E

History as a subject reflects the conception <b>of</b> <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>man</b> as based mainly on the historical context in which the textbooks reflect the actual events of the past.

25|$|Primitive Methodism {{was founded}} by Hugh Bourne, a native of Stoke-on-Trent, at a public {{gathering}} in the nearby village of Mow Cop. He originally followed the Wesleyan form of Methodism but in 1801 he reformed the Methodist service by conducting it outside. He founded the first chapel in Tunstall with his brother in 1811. He promoted Sunday schools {{as a method of}} improving children's education, advocated the equal treatment <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>men,</b> and was involved in the temperance movement. It was from the Primitive Methodists that many early trade unions found their early leaders. Also of note is John Lightfoot, a 17th-century churchman and rabbinical scholar.|$|E
25|$|Both the Qur'anIslam's sacred textand {{the spoken}} or acted {{example of the}} Prophet Muḥammad (Sunnah) {{advocate}} the rights <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>men</b> equally to seek knowledge. The Qur'an commands all Muslims to exert effort {{in the pursuit of}} knowledge, irrespective of their biological sex: it constantly encourages Muslims to read, think, contemplate and learn from the signs of God in nature. Moreover, Muḥammad encouraged education for both males and females: he declared that seeking knowledge was a religious duty binding upon every Muslim man and woman. Like her male counterpart, each woman is under a moral and religious obligation to seek knowledge, develop her intellect, broaden her outlook, cultivate her talents and then utilise her potential to the benefit of her soul and her society.|$|E
25|$|The Malaysian {{information}} technology (IT) sector {{is made up}} equally <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>men,</b> {{with large numbers of}} women employed as university professors and in the private sector. This is a product of two historical trends: the predominance of women in the Malay electronics industry, the precursor to the IT industry, and the national push to achieve a ‘pan-Malayan’ culture beyond the three ethnic groups of Indian, Chinese and Malay. Government support for the education of all three groups is available on a quota basis and, since few Malay men are interested in IT, this leaves more room for women. Additionally, families tend to be supportive of their daughters’ entry into this prestigious and highly remunerated industry, in the interests of upward social mobility. Malaysia's push to develop an endogenous research culture should deepen this trend.|$|E

25|$|Employment {{rights for}} women include {{non-discriminatory}} access {{of women to}} jobs and equal pay. The rights <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>men</b> to have equal pay and equal benefits for equal work were openly denied by the British Hong Kong Government up to the early 1970s. Leslie Wah-Leung Chung (鍾華亮, 1917–2009), President of the Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants' Association 香港政府華員會 (1965–68), contributed {{to the establishment of}} equal pay for men and women, including the right for married women to be permanent employees. Before this, the job status of a woman changed from permanent employee to temporary employee once she was married, thus losing the pension benefit. Some of them even lost their jobs. Since nurses were mostly women, this improvement of the rights of married women meant much to the nursing profession. In some European countries, married women could not work without the consent of their husbands until a few decades ago, for example in France until 1965 and in Spain until 1975. In addition, marriage bars, a practice adopted from the late 19th century to the 1970s across many countries, including Austria, Australia, Ireland, Canada, and Switzerland, restricted married women from employment in many professions.|$|E
25|$|In early 1976 Bahá'í {{women from}} many {{northern}} Latin American countries including Costa Rica gathered in El Salvador for a women's conference {{sponsored by the}} Continental Counselors of Central America and the event included meetings among the Bahá'ís only as well as invited non-Bahá'ís. Some of the attendees called for further meetings and in 1977 the National Women's Committee decided to sponsor monthly teas in communities all over Costa Rica which continued into 1979. The purpose of the teas was to give Bahá'í and non-Babá'í women a chance to discuss their changing role in society, and also for non-Babá'ís to hear of the religion. Men have asked to attend and help though {{the focus of the}} discussions remained the role of women and the equality <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>men.</b> In early 1977 an unusual conference, composed of 1/3 indigenous believers from across Central America - and some non-Bahá'í family members of them were allowed to fully attend the meeting - held in Mérida, Mexico. Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico were priority goal areas for them. In early 1980 the Bahá'í Committee for the Education of Women and Children organized a day-long institute where one hundred children ages 3 to 14 and 35 adults participated in a village. In 1985 fifty-eight people from six of the seven provinces attended a Bahá'í Women's Conference which was planned to help strengthen contact between Bahá'í women of various groups in Costa Rica and to clarify {{the role of women in}} the religion. Presentations were made on the lives of May Maxwell and Martha Root and mentioned local Bahá'í women who pioneered to Costa Rica when the religion was first being established in Costa Rica.|$|E
