Duchen likens the effect <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> barcarolles to that of a reflection shining up through the water.|$|E
5|$|In {{line with}} the Buddhist {{doctrine}} of rebirth, the previous existences of Koṇḍañña are described in Buddhist texts. They repeatedly show a theme of Koṇḍañña having displayed religious inclinations in previous rebirths, many of which involve experiences with previous rebirths of the Buddha and his other leading disciplines. This is a common theme among the leading disciples, {{all of whom had}} many encounters with the future Gautama Buddha in previous lives, and is consistent with the Buddhist concepts of cause and effect and karma. In Pali language Theravada literature, Koṇḍañña is said to have begun striving for enlightenment in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, the 13th Buddha. The son of a wealthy householder at Hamsavati, Koṇḍañña saw the monk who was the first disciple of Padmuttara Buddha. Koṇḍañña's previous rebirth bestowed on the Buddha and the sangha and wished that he was to be the first disciple of a future Buddha. Padumuttara is said to have prophesied the fulfilment <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> era of Gautama Buddha, 1000 aeons into the future. After the passing of Padmuttara Buddha, Koṇḍañña constructed a jewelled chamber inside the cetiya in which the relics were stored and also made an offering of jewel festoons. The Apadana offers a variant on this reincarnation. It states that Koṇḍañña {{was the first person to}} offer a meal to Padumuttara and became a deva in the Tusita world. It further says and that during the time of Vipassī Buddha, Koṇḍañña was a householder named Mahakala who offered the Buddha the first fruits of his field in their nine stages of production. The Mahavastu gives another account explaining the origin of Koṇḍañña's vow to attain arahanthood in his final rebirth. This account asserts that he was a potter at Rajagaha in a previous existence. A Paccekabuddha who was suffering from biliousness sought shelter in the potter's hut and was cured. In time, several more Paccekabuddhas came to visit the hut to inquire about their colleagues health status. The potter asked which of them had realised the dharma first, to which the patient answered in the affirmative. Thereupon the potter made his vow.|$|E
5|$|In the 1890s, {{technology}} {{began to}} change this balance. New Krupp steel armour meant that it was now possible to give a cruiser side armour which would protect it against the quick-firing guns of enemy battleships and cruisers alike. In 1896–97 France and Russia, who were regarded as likely allies {{in the event of}} war, started to build large, fast armoured cruisers taking advantage <b>of</b> <b>this.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> event of a war between Britain and France or Russia, or both, these cruisers threatened to cause serious difficulties for the British Empire's worldwide trade.|$|E

25|$|B. lecheguana is a prey {{target for}} a number of {{different}} animals. The lizard Tupinambis teguixin is known to prey on this wasp, having easy access to its nests since they are low to the ground and easily accessible. A number of birds are suspected to prey on B. lecheguana, although there are relatively few documentations <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> literature. Also, the army ant Eciton dulcius is reported to prey on this wasp. Another source of predation is by asilids, or robber flies.|$|E

25|$|When the {{capacity}} of a double-track railway is in excess of requirements, the two tracks may be reduced to one. In some countries this is called singling. Notable examples <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom occurred on the Oxford-Worcester-Hereford, Princes Risborough-Banbury and Salisbury-Exeter main lines during the 1970s and 1980s. In all these cases, increases in traffic from the late 1990s {{have led to the}} partial reinstatement of double track. In New Zealand the Melling Line was singled to the Western Hutt Railway Station in Lower Hutt in 1958 after it became a branch line rather than part of the main Hutt Valley Line.|$|E

It was decided that an influx of Catholic immigrants from Ireland, Corsica and Italy would provide a loyal base for the Crown and appeals were made to encourage immigration. In 1815, the Spanish Crown had issued the Royal Decree of Graces (Real Cédula de Gracias) which fostered the immigration of European Catholics that were not of Spanish origin to its Caribbean colonies.|$|E
25|$|During the 1960s a split {{emerged in}} the Afrikaner {{electorate}} {{over the issue of}} how to preserve a distinct identity in a multi-ethnic society: one faction insisted on preserving the national identity through strict isolation, while others thought that such barriers needed to be relaxed.

Volcanic activity resumed with Deakin Volcanics in the north west and south of Canberra. First rhyodacite was erupted followed by tuff, more rhyodacite, tuff with some underwater sediments, and finishing with rhyolite. At least four large eruptions made up this volcanic deposit. Over the top <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> west near the Murrumbidgee River there was a further massive volcanic eruption, called Laidlaw Volcanics.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Holden Astra, {{introduced in}} August 1984 as the LB series was a badge engineered Nissan Pulsar (N12). The Pulsar, a Japanese designed model, sold alongside the unique to Australia Astra line-up. The Pulsar for Australia was assembled in Clayton, Victoria; however, for the Astra the body panels were pressed at Holden's Elizabeth, South Australia facility. Unlike its Nissan counterpart, the Astra was only {{offered as a}} five-door hatchback, with the three-door hatchback and four-door sedan body styles omitted from the range due to fears they would overlap with Nissan's own Pulsar range. However, Holden's continuation of the Gemini sedan range was the nearest equivalent <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> range.|$|E
25|$|All known TRAP {{transporters}} contain 3 protein domains. These are the solute binding protein (the SBP), {{the small}} membrane protein domain {{and the large}} membrane protein domain. Following the nomenclature for the first characterized TRAP transporter, DctPQM, these subunits are usually named P, Q and M respectively. Around 10% of TRAP transporters have natural genetic fusions between the two membrane protein components, and in the one well studied example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sialic acid specific TRAP transporter from Haemophilus influenzae the fused gene has been named siaQM. The large M subunit is predicted to have 12 transmembrane helices and the small Q subunit to have 4 transmembrane helices and the fused QM proteins are predicted to have 17 transmembrane helices.|$|E
