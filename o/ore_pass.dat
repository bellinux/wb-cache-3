40|$|As {{the near}} surface {{deposits}} are being mined out, underground mines will increasingly operate at greater depths. This {{will increase the}} challenges related to transporting materials from deeper levels to the surface. For many years, the ore and waste transportation from most deep underground mines has depended on {{some or all of}} the following: truck haulage, conveyor belts, shafts, rails, and <b>ore</b> <b>pass</b> systems. In sub-level caving, and where ore passes are used, trains operating on the main lower level transport the ore from ore passes to a crusher, for subsequent hoisting to the surface through the shaft system. In many mines, the use of the <b>ore</b> <b>pass</b> system has led to several problems related to the <b>ore</b> <b>pass</b> availability, causing production disturbances and incurred cost and time for <b>ore</b> <b>pass</b> rehabilitation. These production disturbances have an impact on the mining activities since they increase the operational costs, and lower the mine throughput. A continued dependency on rock mass transportation using ore passes will generate high capital costs for various supporting structures such as rail tracks, shaft extensions, and crushers for every new main level. This study was conducted at an existing underground mine and analyzed the transport of ore from loading areas at the lower levels up to the existing shaft points using trucks without employing ore passes. The results show that, when the costs of extending ore passes to lower levels become too great or ore passes cannot be used for production, haul trucks can be a feasible alternative method for transport of ore and waste up the ramp to the existing crusher located at the previous main level. The use of trucks will avoid installing infrastructure at the next main level and extending the ore passes to lower levels, hence reducing costs...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this thesis addresses a number of challenges related to rock mass transportation in deep underground mines. In particular, high energy consumption and high exhaust gas emissions from diesel and electric LHDs, the effects of <b>ore</b> <b>pass</b> loss on the loading, hauling and dumping operations due to increasing stresses and increasing costs due to the longer vertical transportation of the rock masses. These critical challenges have been identified by a literature review and analysis of data collected from 15 international deep mines. In order to answer the formulated research questions, three studies on various issues related to rock mass transportation in deep underground mines were made, and the analysis was performed mainly using discrete event simulation. The thesis presents a study of energy consumption and exhaust gas emissions from diesel and electric LHDs with similar bucket sizes. The results show the possible energy savings {{and a decrease in}} CO 2 emissions when using electric LHDs instead of diesel ones. The thesis also presents a study of the effects of <b>ore</b> <b>pass</b> loss on LHD operations and on the mine production. Maintaining the production with a lower number of operational <b>ore</b> <b>pass</b> structures by increasing the number of LHDs can {{have a negative effect on}} the production. This is because an increased number of LHDs in operation will results in increased waiting times for the LHDs and cause variations in the production rate. These variations can be large, causing severe consequences if not managed correctly. The results also show the importance of developing alternative plans for underground loading and hauling operations in case of an <b>ore</b> <b>pass</b> loss. Transportation of rock, especially when mining depth increases, is often associated with high costs and long transportation times. To decrease the amount of unnecessary rock transportation, near-to-face sorting plants may be one alternative. In the thesis, a study was performed on a possible reduction in rock mass transportation to the surface when using this technique. The results conclude that near-to-face sorting plants could lower the environmental effects generated by unnecessary rock transportation to the surface...|$|E

In self-defence the M&CR deposited a Bill for running powers over those lines that had been friendly before the takeover, but the LNWR negotiated terms on 2 April 1866: the M&CR got running powers east from Brigham to Cockermouth and west to the triangular Marron Junction; and four passenger services were to be operated daily by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR, successor to the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway) from Maryport to Whitehaven in connection with Carlisle trains there. The M&CR also secured a traffic sharing agreement for mineral traffic destined for Scotland: one half of such traffic arising from the ore field would run via Marron Junction, from where the M&CR would convey it northwards; the other half would travel via Whitehaven.

40|$|Bibliography: 126 - 127. All open cast mines have {{a limited}} {{economic}} life which is usually dictated ·by the so called economic depth, where the costs of hauling the ore via large diesel trucks becomes prohibitive.

40|$|As ore grades have {{decreased}} and the mining depth has {{increased over the}} past few decades, other characteristics than ore grade and tonnage are becoming important. The underground mining process, from in-situ rock mass characteristics to the final mill product with fully liberated minerals, consists of a chain of unit operations that impact, and are influenced by, fragmentation. This report presents the baseline mapping of the project “From Face to Surface”, studying the effects of fragmentation on the process flow in an underground SLC mine. It analyses the underground unit operations in detail, from mine planning to shafts, and maps the blast fragmentation’s effect on the process flow. The goal is to provide a deeper understanding of fragmentation´s effect on different unit operations. The objective is to describe the mining operation at Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara AB (LKAB) and identify key areas for improving fragmentation. To understand how fragmentation influences different operations in the mine, the project conducted a literature study, collected data and interviewed mine personnel in LKAB’s Malmberget mine. Data were collected from the mine’s internal systems, such as GIRON, WOLIS, IP 21 and a local drilling data system. The interviews were conducted in cooperation with research personnel from the mine. This baseline mapping shows that the mining operation in Malmberget is affected by fragmentation in several ways. For some unit operations, the fragmentation has a large impact, while for others, it has none at all. The influence of fragmentation starts with the loading operation after the initial blasting and ends with the crushing operation. For the former, boulders are the largest problem, as they cause a great deal of idle time, either when they have to be moved to a separate drift for secondary blasting or when they create hang-ups in the ore passes. When boulders are dumped into the ore passes, they risk damaging the <b>ore</b> <b>pass</b> walls. If boulders create a hang-up, it has to be removed. If the hang-up must be removed with explosives, there is a risk of further damaging the <b>ore</b> <b>pass.</b> In addition, the toxic fumes created by the explosives hinder production until the pass is ventilated. Finally, hang-ups affect the transportation operation as the trucks cannot use an <b>ore</b> <b>pass</b> blocked by a hang-up or closed for ventilation of toxic fumes. There is also a slight possibility that a boulder which does not get stuck in the <b>ore</b> <b>pass</b> will get stuck on a truck. The last operation affected by fragmentation is crushing; boulders and large fragments risk creating a hang-up in the crusher. There are no reports of problems related to fragmentation after this point. The results suggest that further work and mine trials are required in the following areas: drilling, loading, ore passes and crushers. Godkänd; 2016; 20160607 (anngus...|$|E
