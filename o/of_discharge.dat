5|$|Environmental hazards {{induced by}} humans also puts {{sirenians}} at risk. Sirenians, especially the West Indian manatee, face high mortality from watercraft collision, {{and about half}} of all West Indian manatee deaths are caused by watercraft collisions. An increased usage of hydroelectric power and subsequent damming of rivers increase waterway traffic, which can lead to vessel collisions, and manatees may become entangled in navigational locks. The urbanized coastline of areas such as the Caribbean and Australia can result in the decline of seagrass populations. Reliable areas of warm water in Florida are generally the result <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> from power plants, but newer plants with more efficient cooling systems may disrupt the pattern of warm water refuges, and an increased demand for artesian springs for water, the natural source of warm water, decreases the number of warm water refuges. Sirenians can be caught as bycatch from fisheries, and they can be seen as pests with the interference of local fishermen and the destruction of their nets. African manatees have also been known to venture into rice paddies and destroy the crops during the rainy season, and these confrontations with locals may lead to intentional culling of the manatees.|$|E

25|$|The mitrailleuse's {{dependence}} on manual loading meant that its firing rate depended greatly on {{the skill of}} its operators. A skillfully manned Reffye mitrailleuse could sustain four volleys (100 rounds) per minute in ordinary operation and reach five volleys (125 rounds) per minute during emergencies. The rapidity <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> of each individual volley (25 rounds) was controlled by the gunner's action on a small manual crank {{on the right side}} of the breech. In other words, the weapon's 25 barrels were not discharged all at once but in rapid succession. Because it was so heavy (1,500lbs), the Reffye mitrailleuse did not recoil during firing and thus did not need to be re-sighted on its target after each volley. This absence of recoil during firings was promoted by Reffye as a considerable advantage over conventional field artillery. Each regular battery of Reffye mitrailleuses lined up six guns firing together, more or less side by side.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{physical}} and geographical characteristics of over 1. 4 million cloud-ground electric air discharges {{recorded by the}} National Electric Air Discharge Detection Network throughout Romania over 2003 - 2005 are presented here. These characteristics include total density <b>of</b> cloud- ground <b>discharges,</b> density <b>of</b> positive <b>discharges,</b> percentage <b>of</b> positive <b>discharges,</b> and diurnal variation {{of the total number}} <b>of</b> <b>discharges.</b> Every analysis was carried out at 0. 2 ° space resolution, corresponding to about 20 -km resolution. Discharge density was not corrected according to detection efficiency, herein being presented only the measured values. Maximum density tops 9 discharges km- 2 in Olteniei Plain and Jiu’s Defile areas. The monthly mean number <b>of</b> <b>discharges</b> reached a maximum of about 12. 5 · 104 in July. Maximum density <b>of</b> positive <b>discharges,</b> which is higher than 0. 08 discharges km- 2, was recorded around the cities of Barlad and Suceava. The monthly mean number <b>of</b> positive <b>discharges</b> has a main maximum corresponding to July (about 2000 discharges) and a secondary one in May. High values of the annual mean percentage <b>of</b> positive <b>discharges</b> are specific to Eastern Romania regions. Monthly mean positive discharge percentage varies between 2 % in July and 18 % in January. Diurnal variation <b>of</b> <b>discharges</b> has the same characteristics over the year, with a maximum within 1600 - 1800 TL. When the connection between whole atmospheric electricity and ETOPO- 2 topographic measurements, at 0. 2 ° x 0. 2 ° resolution, is analyzed, a decrease by altitude can be noticed in total number <b>of</b> <b>discharges.</b> The proximity sounding method was applied in order to point out the physical processes leading to lightning strokes...|$|R
25|$|Otitis {{media is}} a group of {{inflammatory}} diseases of the middle ear. The two main types are acute otitis media (AOM) and otitis media with effusion (OME). AOM is an infection of abrupt onset that usually presents with ear pain. In young children this may result in pulling at the ear, increased crying, and poor sleep. Decreased eating and a fever may also be present. OME is typically not associated with symptoms. Occasionally a feeling of fullness is described. It is defined as the presence of non-infectious fluid in the middle ear for more than three months. Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is middle ear inflammation of greater than two weeks that results in episodes <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> from the ear. It may be a complication of acute otitis media. Pain is rarely present. All three may be associated with hearing loss. The hearing loss in OME, due to its chronic nature, may affect a child's ability to learn.|$|E
25|$|The full {{evolutionary}} {{history of the}} beetle's unique defense mechanism is unknown, but biologists {{have shown that the}} system could have theoretically evolved from defenses found in other beetles in incremental steps by natural selection. Specifically, quinone chemicals are a precursor to sclerotin, a brownish substance produced by beetles and other insects to harden their exoskeleton. Some beetles additionally store excess foul-smelling quinones, including hydroquinone, in small sacs below their skin as a natural deterrent against predators—all carabid beetles have this sort of arrangement. Some beetles additionally mix hydrogen peroxide, a common by-product of the metabolism of cells, in with the hydroquinone; some of the catalases that exist in most cells make the process more efficient. The chemical reaction produces heat and pressure, and some beetles exploit the latter to push out the chemicals onto the skin; this is the case in the beetle Metrius contractus, which produces a foamy discharge when attacked. In the bombardier beetle, the muscles that prevent leakage from the reservoir additionally developed a valve permitting more controlled discharge of the poison and an elongated abdomen to permit better control over the direction <b>of</b> <b>discharge.</b>|$|E

Empire Cowdray was the first Allied merchant ship into Cagliari after Germany forces had left Sardinia. Several ships had been sunk as blockships and all the cranes in the harbour had been sabotaged.
