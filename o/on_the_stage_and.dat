Saronni regained the race lead after finishing second <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>and</b> earning a fifteen-second time bonus. The next two stages both resulted in a bunch sprint, with Guido Bontempi winning stage 7 and Franco Chioccioli, stage 8.

Malvor-Bottecchia-Vaporella rider Acácio da Silva won the stage as the top of the general classification rankings remained unchanged from the previous days.|$|E
5|$|After {{seeing a}} {{production}} of Hamlet starring Sir Frank Benson, Richardson decided to become an actor and made his stage debut, playing a gendarme in The Bishop's Candlesticks in December 1920. After touring and appearing in rep, he made his London debut in July 1926 as the stranger in Oedipus at Colonus. In 1930 he joined the Old Vic where he first met Gielgud, staying with the company until the following year. After service during the Second World War with the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, he returned to acting, preferring {{the works of the}} more modern authors Luigi Pirandello, Joe Orton, Harold Pinter, George Bernard Shaw and J. B. Priestley to the classic plays of Shakespeare. A radio career ran in parallel to that <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> <b>and</b> Richardson was first broadcast in The City in 1929.|$|E
5|$|Davidson's family {{assumed that}} he would follow his father in {{becoming}} a priest and he was brought up strictly. When he was six he began attending Banister Court School in Southampton, an establishment founded initially for the sons of Merchant Navy officers. In 1890 Harold was sent to live with two maiden aunts in Croydon while he attended the Whitgift School. Here he became an enthusiastic amateur actor, encouraged by his friendship with a fellow-pupil, Leon Quartermaine, who later won recognition <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>and</b> in films. In February 1894 the pair appeared together in a school production of the farce Sent to the Tower. Under his aunts' influence, Davidson became a part-time worker at Toynbee Hall, an East End charity founded by Samuel and Henrietta Barnett which attracted many volunteers from schools and universities. Because of these distractions he neglected his school work and failed to win a scholarship that would enable him to attend Oxford University and study for holy orders. In {{the face of his}} father's disapproval, he decided to pursue a career as a stage comedian.|$|E

5|$|Menchov was fifth after Alpe di Siusi, but rose {{to second}} before stage 12, the {{very long and}} hilly {{individual}} time trial in Cinque Terre. There, he claimed a convincing victory; only Levi Leipheimer finished within a minute of Menchov's winning time. Di Luca was nearly two minutes slower than him, finished sixth <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> <b>and</b> fell to second overall, with Menchov assuming the race lead. Di Luca tried repeatedly to shed Menchov during the remaining mountain stages {{to make up the}} time difference, which was never more than a minute. The two riders were involved in sprints for time bonuses at the finish line in stages 16 and 17, as well as an intermediate sprint in stage 20. Menchov was consistently quicker than Di Luca in these sprints. With his superior time-trial skills providing the difference in the final stage, the Russian was able to emerge as Giro champion, despite a dramatic fall in the final kilometre before the finish line.|$|E
5|$|The high {{mountain}} Stage 14 into the Italian Alps saw Contador rise to second overall, just five seconds behind race leader Gabriele Bosisio. The next day, Contador finished twelve minutes ahead of Bosisio {{and took the}} race leader's pink jersey. His main rival at that point was Riccardo Riccò, who had gained 16 seconds on him that day and was only 33 back overall. Contador padded his lead over Riccò slightly in short time trial in Stage 16, and stayed out of trouble in Stages 17 and 18, stages where the contenders all finished together. The long and mountainous Stage 19 saw Riccò and Danilo Di Luca both put time into Contador with late attacks, {{but not enough to}} take the jersey from him. Di Luca found himself effected the next day, losing over five minutes and falling from contention, but Contador and Riccò finished together and were separated by just 4 seconds entering the Stage 21 time trial. Riccò was unable to challenge Contador in the Giro's finale, finishing 68th <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>and</b> losing close to two minutes to Contador, who was 11th. Though neither Contador himself nor anyone from the team won any stage in the Giro, Contador took the overall victory in the General Classification.|$|E
5|$|To keep low {{frequency}} sound {{focused on the}} audience area and not <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> <b>and</b> to keep low frequencies from bothering people outside of the event space, {{a variety of techniques}} have been developed in concert sound to turn the naturally omnidirectional radiation of subwoofers into a more directional pattern. Several examples of sound reinforcement system applications where sound engineers seek to provide more directional bass sound are music festivals, which often have several bands performing at the same time on different stages; large raves or EDM events, where there are multiple DJs performing {{at the same time in}} different rooms or stages; and multiplex movie theatres, in which there are many films being shown simultaneously in auditoriums that share common walls. These techniques include setting up subwoofers in a vertical array; using combinations of delay and polarity inversion; and setting up a delay-shaded system. With a cardioid dispersion pattern, two end-fire subwoofers can be placed one in front of the other. The enclosure nearest the listener is delayed by a few milliseconds The second subwoofer is delayed a precise amount corresponding to the time it takes sound to traverse the distance between speaker grilles.|$|E

5|$|Written in 1866, Augusta Jane Evans {{domestic}} novel St. Elmo {{became one}} of the best-selling novels of the 19th century. Its popularity would spur the creation of popular consumer products, parodies and even the names of several towns. Evans was concerned about how the novel's themes would be portrayed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>and</b> did not approve the first script for a St. Elmo play until 1909. It is also unknown if Evans was aware of any intention to adapt the novel for the screen. Lloyd Lonergan adapted the play for the Thanhouser Company. The Book News Monthly said that Lonergan received a share of interest in the company for his good work in producing the scenario. Lonergan already had a single share of 100 total shares of the company from the initial $10,000 in capital in 1909.|$|E
