40|$|Pile {{retaining}} walls {{are widely used}} {{in the practice of}} anti-landslide construction. Underground sections of piles tend to bend under the pressure. Besides the landslide pressure, the pile is rebuffed by the soil below the retaining wall. When a slope section begins creeping due to the influence of gravitational forces and the pressure of bending piles, soil resistance alongside the pile length changes over the time. This phenomenon also contributes to bending. The question of how the bearing capacity of an anti-landslide pile changes under the influence of a steady viscous flow of the slope has not undergone any comprehensive research. In this study, the authors offer a number of analytical expressions that define the interaction between the piles with the sliding slope. Authors examine how piles work to stabilize the viscous soil environment over the time. The basis of the rheological calculation of the landslide mass is the integral correlation, which in particular cases leads to well-known solutions concerning the characteristics of the deformation and speed of the viscous flow in terms of the pressure-driven gravitational movement. When problems of interaction of flexible piles with the creeping slope are solved, approximation of the linear or non-linear theory of elasticity for the quasi-instantaneous state is regularly used. In this case, the time factor is identified by multiplying the degree of deformation by the time function (). In the event of a steady viscous flow moving away from the wall, the authors analyze resistance to bending over the time {{with the help of a}} triangular <b>outline</b> <b>diagram</b> (, 0). The authors welcome any corrections of their analytical solutions for cases of visco-plastic flows as well as the projected resistance caused by the extrusion of the landslide mass through spaces in-between piles.
