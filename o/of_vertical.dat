40|$|In {{the paper}} the {{determination}} of topographic and isostatic redress surface influence on verticals in mountain regions is presented. Relative verticals, i. e. verticals determined {{on the base of}} astronomical and geodetic measurements, are a subject of solution. The graphic method according to J. R. Clarke for determining topographic elements (corrections) <b>of</b> <b>verticals</b> is presented. The Clarke graphic method goes out from the Newton gravitational low. This method operates with a simple topographic map and a constructed sculptured glass of sectors of sphere. Numerical procedures for the calculation of isostatic elements <b>of</b> <b>verticals</b> are based on several hypotheses (theories) about hydrostatic balance (isostatic redress) of mass in the earth crust: the Pratt hypothesis, Airy hypothesis, Hayford hypothesis and the Heiskanen hypothesis. Their hypotheses have been confirmed as theories. The presented graphic and numerical procedures in solving topographic and isostatic elements <b>of</b> relative <b>verticals</b> were applied to a model mountain conditions in the Èerme¾ valley nearby Koice. Six points at a various height were chosen on the south slope of this valley. A topographic map in the scale 1 : 10000 was used to determine the topographic elements <b>of</b> <b>verticals.</b> The sculpture glass of sectors of sphere following out from the theoretical procedure according to j. R. Clarke was produced. The simple software was developed to numerically solve both vertical elements, i. e. the topographic and isostatic elements. The tables in this paper give a review of the reached results in the determined topographic and isostatic elements <b>of</b> <b>verticals.</b> The values <b>of</b> these elements do not exceed 20 " what is a maximum value for verticals in our geographical latitudes and longitudes. The presented problem <b>of</b> estimating <b>of</b> <b>verticals</b> is <b>of</b> significance in many adjustments of geodetic networks where verticals have an sizeable influence on the geodetic network accuracy...|$|R

40|$|The diploma {{introduces}} the local method of establishing the deflections <b>of</b> <b>verticals</b> {{with the help}} of a plane, which is calculated on the basis of interpolated geoid heights. In the year 2000, the exact surface of the geoid for the region of Slovenia, which is given in the form of a regular grid, was established. In the diploma, this grid of geoid heights formed the basis for the interpolation of the geoid heights of points, from which the plane was established. The coefficients of the plane give the deflection <b>of</b> the <b>vertical</b> in the point of gravity. This means that, given a known geoid, we can calculate the deflection <b>of</b> <b>verticals</b> at any point in the region of Slovenia. In the diploma, we compared the calculation deflections with the measured deflections and the defections determined from the global geopotential model EGM 96. In this way we have tried to estimate the accuracy of the calculation deflections. Unfortunately, we could not compare the calculation deflections with the measured deflections at the border areas of Croatia and Austria, since the geoid model of Slovenia reaches exactly to the border. A lesser accuracy of the calculation deflections <b>of</b> <b>verticals</b> also results from this. Given an adequate accuracy of calculation deflections, we could, by employing automated procedures, use the declinations <b>of</b> <b>verticals</b> in different calculations and thus eliminate the need for lengthy measurements. For a more accurate use of this procedure, it would be recommendable to determine the calculation deflections from the new geoid model of Slovenia...|$|R
5|$|Directional {{stability}} {{was achieved}} by four fixed vanes, two vertical and two horizontal, attached {{at the rear of}} the gas-bag, and by a long vertical vane running along the main axis of the gas-bag from the centre of the elliptical frame to its rear.

The empennage consisted <b>of</b> <b>vertical</b> and horizontal vanes arranged like the fletching of an arrow, behind which the vertical rudder was mounted.

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Korean War, {{a number}} of {{aircraft}} companies in both Europe and America separately decided to investigate the prospective <b>of</b> <b>vertical</b> take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft, which would eliminate the requirement for vulnerable runways by taking off and landing vertically as opposed to the conventional horizontal approach. In addition to military applications, the prospect of applying such technology to commercial airliners was also viewed with considerable interest by the mid 1950s, thus the value of developing viable vertical take-off systems was judged to be substantial. However, even during this era, few companies had envisioned that a VTOL aircraft would also be realistically compatible with the characteristics of high performance military aircraft.|$|E

The horizontal volume of the station is due to the conditions of the site, the functions, and development regulations.

5|$|Lobatus gigas has {{an unusual}} means of locomotion, first {{described}} in 1922 by George Howard Parker (1864–1955).

5|$|More {{recent studies}} by volcanologists {{associated}} with the Geological Survey of Canada have indicated that the subducted extension of the Nookta Fault may be {{the primary cause of}} the alkalic structure of the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field. The volcanism might have been mostly generated by asthenospheric upwelling possibly by displacement along the transform fault. If the transform fault had a section <b>of</b> <b>vertical</b> tearing to contain potentially different dip angles between the Explorer and Juan de Fuca Plates, the subducted plate asthenosphere may possibly flow upward into the mantle wedge. Similarly, if the displacement had a section of extension, a horizontal slab window-like gap would have developed, again allowing a pathway for upwelling magma. In either case, the unsettled asthenosphere might have experienced low degrees of decompressional melting and interacted with North American lithosphere to yield within plate compositions.|$|E
