5|$|According to Dallas, {{it rained}} on days that were {{supposed}} to be sunny, while <b>other</b> <b>days</b> of production lacked rain when {{they were supposed to be}} rainy. Goodwin added that the scene of Snow and Charming releasing the birds was freezing because of the heavy rain. Their scene in the cabin took place on the first day of the episode's production. Her near-death scene involved a real cliff, though the height was exaggerated later using CGI and a green screen; a stunt double stood in for some of the shots.|$|E

5|$|The plans changed {{dramatically}} and Trans Polar was instead incorporated in Norway. It took delivery of used Boeing 720 jetliners from Eastern Air Lines with registration on 4 June 1970. The airline received an operating license on 11 June to fly both cargo and passenger charter services from Norway. The original plans called for passenger flights {{in and around}} the weekends to the Mediterranean and freight and maintenance the <b>other</b> <b>days,</b> including transporting strawberries from Belgium to Norway. A maintenance contract was signed with Aer Lingus of Ireland.|$|E

5|$|Some Romans, {{following}} a belief possibly originating in Mesopotamia but developed in Hellenistic Egypt, {{believed that the}} seven gods after whom the planets were named took hourly shifts in looking after affairs on Earth. The order of shifts went Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon (from the farthest to the closest planet). Therefore, the first day was started by Saturn (1st hour), second day by Sun (25th hour), followed by Moon (49th hour), Mars, Mercury, Jupiter and Venus. Because each day was named by the god that started it, {{this is also the}} order of the days of the week in the Roman calendar after the Nundinal cycle was rejected – and still preserved in many modern languages. In English, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday are straightforward translations of these Roman names. The <b>other</b> <b>days</b> were renamed after Tiw (Tuesday), Wóden (Wednesday), Thunor (Thursday), and Fríge (Friday), the Anglo-Saxon gods considered similar or equivalent to Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, and Venus, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The Decree-law 150/87 {{states that}} the flag is to be hoisted from 9:00a.m. to sunset (during the night, it must be {{properly}} lit), on Sundays and national holidays, throughout the entire national territory. It can also be displayed on days where official ceremonies or other solemn public sessions are held; in this case, the flag is hoisted on-site. The flag can be hoisted in <b>other</b> <b>days</b> if it is considered appropriate by the central government, or by other regional or local governing bodies, or by heads of private institutions. It must follow the official design standard and be preserved in good condition.|$|E
5|$|The Festivals are Nativity, Epiphany, the Baptism of our Lord, the Transfiguration, the Annunciation, Palm Sunday, Easter, the Ascension, Pentecost, Holy Trinity, All Saints, and Christ the King. Most {{of these}} festivals {{are tied to}} the {{moveable}} feast of Easter. Festivals take precedence over all <b>other</b> <b>days,</b> including Sundays, have their own collects and Eucharistic proper prefaces. Of the festivals, Christmas is considered to be twelve days in length (from December 25 until January 5) and Easter is fifty days in length (from Easter Sunday up to and inclusive of Pentecost). For Easter, Sundays are considered to be another part of the festival. For the Ascension which, falling on fortieth day of Easter, will always be on a Thursday, the festival is sometimes transferred to the Seventh Sunday of Easter in addition to or in place of the normal part of the Easter festival for that day.|$|E

5|$|The {{lease on}} Bryn Eglwys expired in 1942, but was {{extended}} {{on an annual}} basis. The October 1942 Bradshaw's Guide shows two return passenger trains operating only on Monday, Wednesday and Fridays, taking 45 minutes in each direction. No passenger service was provided on <b>other</b> <b>days.</b> Overnight on 26 December 1946, several weakened support columns in the quarry gave way, resulting in a significant collapse; the quarry was deemed unsafe and closed immediately. Haydn Jones had promised to continue operating the railway {{as long as he}} was alive and so, despite the closure of the quarry, the railway continued to run trains on a shoestring budget. In 1947 the British railway system was nationalised and the Talyllyn was one of the few operating railways not included. The reasons for this are unclear, but it is significant that all official mention of the railway had ceased several decades before and it is likely that the line was simply forgotten by officialdom. Between 1947 and 1949 the railway ran a passenger service two days a week. In 1949 Haydn Jones, who owned the Aberllefenni Slate Quarry purchased 10 tons of rail from the recently lifted Corris Railway. On 2 July 1950 Haydn Jones died and closure of the railway seemed inevitable, but the line continued to operate for the remainder of the summer season, ending on 6 October.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} water {{restriction}} on feed {{of a group}} of Nubian goats was studied. Fifteen Nubian goats similar in age and parity were randomly divided into three groups of five goats each. The animals were watered every <b>other</b> <b>day,</b> once every day and adlibtum. They fed with Lucerne hay and concentrate which was composed (sorghum, wheat bran, molasses and salt). The experiment was conducted in autumn season There {{was no significant difference between}} goats watered every <b>other</b> <b>day</b> and goats watered adlibtum while the goats watered once every day showed a significant decrease in feed intake. Water consumption showed highly significant differences between the three groups. The goats watered every <b>other</b> <b>day</b> recorded a decrease in the consumption compared with the other two groups. The apparent digestibility coefficients for dry matter and crude protein did not significantly differ between the goats watered every <b>other</b> <b>day</b> and the goats watered once every day. However, the group which was watered adlibtum was reported a decrease in the dry matter and crude protein digestibility. The total nitrogen retained was significantly higher in goats watered every <b>other</b> <b>day</b> than the goats watered once every day while goats watered adlibtum had reported the lowest value of nitrogen retained in animal body. Animals body weight showed significant decrease in the goats watered every <b>other</b> <b>day</b> and goats watered once every day with an increase in the goats watered adlibtum during the six weeks of the experiment...|$|R
