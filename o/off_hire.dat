40|$|The {{thesis is}} dealing with legal issues that may arise in a course of {{chartering}} of vessels for the offshore special surveys (data collection). The offshore seismic data acquisition is used as the main example. However, {{a large part of}} the discussion can be equally relevant for the charter parties intended for other survey types (e. g., pipeline surveys, electromagnetic seabed sounding, and many others). The special survey operations are distinguished by use of the high technologies and, thus, expensive equipment. Most of these technical features are essential for fulfilling such tasks, and many of them are interrelated with issues of chartering a survey ship. Such agreements are most often based on the standard BIMCO’s (The Baltic International Maritime Conference) SUPPLYTIME 89 or SUPPLYTIME 2005 forms. The aim of the current research is, in general, to develop an understanding of possible legal implications of the use of SUPPLYTIME 2005 when chartering the special survey vessels The survey is typically run for a client (e. g., an oil company), and the relationship between the entity acquiring the data and the client are regulated by the data acquisition contract. In turn, the entity acquiring the data is the charterer with respect to the discussed charter parties. The data acquisition contract always prescribes minimum “standards of work”, which set strict requirements on the work of the ship and the equipment (both belonging to the shipowner and to the charterer). The problems considered in the paper could be provisionally divided into two categories. Issues attributed to the first category are related to the essence of the charter party of survey ships and the notion of “vessel’s work”. The second category embraces the issues related to the “equipment”. In general, it has been shown that the terms of SUPPLYTIME 2005 became less favorable to charterer in comparison to SUPPLYTIME 89. Considerable part of the outcomes of this research comprised of the findings related to the <b>off</b> <b>hire.</b> Firstly (i), it has been shown that in certain circumstances it is very difficult to fulfill the condition of “being prevented from working” under survey charters based on SUPPLYTIME 2005. Secondly (ii), it has been argued that such a cause for the vessel going <b>off</b> <b>hire</b> as failings and/or breakdown of equipment will be hardly found as a relevant cause to award the charterer to an off-hire, since such causes are not included in the wording of cl. 13 (a). It was demonstrated that the possibility that a court will find the condition (i) fulfilled and, at the same time, the cause (ii) falling within the scope of cl. 13 (a) is very questionable. This makes the charterer a vulnerable party in relation to the <b>off</b> <b>hire.</b> Possible ways to develop the standard form in connection with these and other issues were suggested...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} major {{shipping}} companies which operate fleets comprised largely of vessels which are time chartered and subsequently sub-chartered on voyage terms. Legal risks will arise {{for the time}} charterer due the differing natures and terms of time and voyage charters. The essential question examined in this thesis is that of whether, and to what extent, legal risk can be minimized by the negotiation of equivalent contractual terms under time and voyage charter parties. The key areas addressed in this thesis are delivery under time charters compared to readiness under voyage charters, <b>off</b> <b>hire</b> under time charters versus suspension of laytime under voyage charters, obligations relating to cleanliness of cargo spaces, rights and responsibilities relative to safe berths and ports, the time charterer's position under bills of lading, and issues relating to redelivery of the vessel and consequent voyage charter liability if the vessel is unable to undertake the final voyage. The methodology applied is {{an examination of the}} case law, with a primary focus on the extensive body of English jurisprudence. This analysis of the case law is accompanied by a consideration of provisions of major charter party forms. The analysis leads to the conclusion that risk, to varying degrees, can be minimized through the application and clarification of contractual language. With respect to readiness of the vessel it is considered that risk will be reduced through agreeing contractual language which requires early notification of the vessel's delay. As regards <b>off</b> <b>hire</b> and laytime wording that clarifies non physical deficiencies is proposed. With regard to vessel cargo spaces intermediate cleanliness is identified as the greatest risk. Safe port and berth warranties are determined to represent an area of easily manageable risk, while letters of indemnity relating to bills of lading continue to represent very significant risk with suggested but no certain solution. Finally, with respect to redelivery a final voyage clause for time charters has been proposed which serves to almost eliminate risk in this area. Therefore, it is broadly concluded that risk can be managed but not eliminated through drafting of appropriate contractual terms...|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{a great deal}} of {{research}} efforts in ship hydromechanics have been devoted to practical navigation problems in moving larger ships safely into existing harbors and inland waterways. An area of particular concern is the prediction of ship squat in shallow or restricted waters at different speeds. Squat may cause grounding of the ship which result in severe damage to the ship, and consequently higher repair bills and <b>off</b> <b>hire</b> losses. River Nile cruisers are encountering squat every movement due to lacking water depth and stand up to grounding risk day after day. In this paper a series of simple but practical useful theoretical models concerning ship squat problems in shallow waterways are discussed. Luxor-Aswan is a selected waterway for the present study. In the course of this study, characteristics of Luxor-Aswan waterway and main feature of existing Nile cruisers are outlined. Finally, theoretical squat analysis of a candidate Nile cruiser has been presented. The results show the position and magnitude of maximum squat, grounding speed has been also identified. It has been found that masters awareness of squat phenomenon and its prediction for each specific vessel is of great concern for vessel safety. This work can be useful for ship designers, naval architects and naval officers, who have to be aware of squat effects, with a specific end goal to avoid any squat related accidents...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{includes two}} related chapters that investigate corporate governance. In the first chapter, {{we examine the}} effectiveness of board monitoring on CEOs. It is widely believed that outsider boards are better monitors. In fact, regulations now require that {{the board of directors}} of publicly traded firms be composed of a majority of independent directors (or outsiders). However, this paper documents that an insider-dominated board can monitor the CEO just as well as an outsider board can when the firm 2 ̆ 7 s CEO is hired from outside. The results suggest that what matters is not so much as the structure of the board, but the 2 ̆ 2 independence 2 ̆ 2 between the board and the CEO it monitors. Specifically, we find that insider boards monitor more of their firms 2 ̆ 7 CEOs if the CEO is hired from outside than from within. In addition, outsider boards monitor both inside and outside CEOs the same way. We also find little difference between insider and outsider boards when they monitor outside CEOs. The main contribution of this paper is to show that an insider board can be an effective monitor as long as it is independent of the CEO. In other words, what is important is board independence, not board structure per se. In chapter two, we examine the relation between the change in a firm 2 ̆ 7 s value and its CEO selection sources: internal promotion versus external hire in both high and low product competition environments. Our results show that firms will be better <b>off</b> <b>hiring</b> an outside CEO (external hire) when the firms operate in a low product competition industry. Specifically, the evidence shows that hiring an outside CEO for a firm in a low product competition industry will increase the firm 2 ̆ 7 s value by about 3...|$|R
