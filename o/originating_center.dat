30|$|In conclusion, low-T ESR {{study has}} {{revealed}} that the grain boundaries in continuous large-area few-layer 2 H MoS 2 films synthesized by sulfurization of Mo films have incorporated an excessive density of paramagnetic defects, a fact, as it appears, inherent to the preparation method applied. Occurring in densities of up to ~ 3 [*]×[*] 1012  cm− 2 for 4 ML-thick MoS 2 films, on comparative grounds, these defects will inaptly impair and limit the charge carrier mobility and limit optoelectronic functionality. Led by stepwise elimination, the <b>originating</b> <b>center</b> is tentatively assigned to the SMo or S 2 Mo antisite, “inherently” associated with grain boundaries, an intrinsic structural defect of which the incorporation emerges as inherent to the growth method used. With respect to the fabrication method applied, the incorporation of such type of defect in distinct quantities may perhaps not come as a surprise. The advanced hypothesis is {{to be subjected to}} verification by first-principle theoretical simulations able to reliably calculate g values of point defects in MoS 2 to sufficient accuracy.|$|E
40|$|Background: Hemiarthroplasty of the {{shoulder}} is known to provide satisfactory long term results provided concentric reduction can be obtained in {{a high percentage of}} patients. Careful soft tissue balancing with appropriate adaptation of version of the component appears to allow good results permitting centering of the arthroplasty without replacement of a glenoid component. The study was aimed to evaluate the midterm outcome in patients with Oxford cementless shoulder hemiarthroplasty for end stage arthritis with intact or reparable full thickness rotator cuff tears. Materials and Methods: 29 consecutive patients (30 shoulders) who underwent Oxford cementless shoulder hemiarthroplasty between 2004 and 2006 were analyzed. Mean age was 71 years (range 34 - 91 years, 95 % of the confidence interval [CI] of standard deviation [SD] was 10. 32 - 17. 58). Mean duration of preoperative symptoms was 42. 8 months (range 9 - 84 months, 95 % CI of SD was 17. 83 - 30. 11). Patients′ self reported Oxford shoulder score (OSS) was collected prospectively and was used as an assessment tool to measure final outcome. Results: The mean initial OSS was 17. 9 (range 7 - 43, 95 % CI of the SD was 7. 19 - 12. 13). The score improved by an average of 16. 9 points at a mean followup of 5. 9 years (range 4. 3 - 7. 6 years) to reach mean final OSS of 34. 8 (range 13 - 48, 95 % CI of the SD was 9. 31 - 15. 73). The improvement of OSS was highly significant with a two tailed P < 0. 0001 and 95 % CI of this difference was 11. 47 - 22. 20. Conclusion: This study demonstrates shoulder hemiarthroplasty as reliable procedure for improvement of shoulder function as shown by the patients′ self reported outcome score (OSS) in end stage glenohumeral arthritis with intact or reparable rotator cuff at midterm followup. Our results suggest successful outcome of the Oxford shoulder hemiarthroplasty (Corin, UK) away from its <b>originating</b> <b>center</b> and in hospitals where fewer shoulder replacements are performed...|$|E

NIX, which provides a single entry point to search selected image databases at the NASA Centers, is a meta-search engine (i. e., a search engine that communicates with other search engines). It uses these distributed digital image databases to access photographs, animations, and their associated descriptive information (meta-data). NIX is available for use at the following URL: [URL] which was sponsored by NASAs Scientific and Technical Information (STI) Program, currently serves images from seven NASA Centers. Plans are under way to link image databases from three additional NASA Centers. images and their associated meta-data, which are accessible by NIX, reside at the <b>originating</b> <b>Centers,</b> and NIX utilizes a virtual central site that communicates with each of these sites. Incorporated into the virtual central site are several protocols to support searches from a diverse collection of database engines. The searches are performed in parallel to ensure optimization of response times. To augment the search capability, browse functionality with pre-defined categories has been built into NIX, thereby ensuring dissemination of 'best-of-breed' imagery. As a final recourse, NIX offers access to a help desk via an on-line form to help locate images and information either within the scope of NIX or from available external sources...|$|R
