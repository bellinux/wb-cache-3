5|$|In 2003 and 2004, 31 {{fish species}} {{were found at}} 20 sites in the {{watershed}} of Roaring Creek. Eastern blacknose dace {{are the most common}} fish species in the watershed and were observed at 85 percent of the sites. White suckers and brown trout <b>occurred</b> <b>at</b> 80 percent of the sites, longnose dace <b>occurred</b> <b>at</b> 70 percent of the sites, cutlips minnows <b>occurred</b> <b>at</b> 65 percent of the sites, and bluegills <b>occurred</b> <b>at</b> 60 percent of the sites. Fallfish, golden shiners, yellow bullheads, and American eels were all historically observed in the watershed, but were not found during the survey. However, redside dace, creek chubsuckers, green sunfish, and fathead minnows were observed in the watershed for the first time during the 2003/2004 survey. The most common game species was wild brown trout, although smaller numbers of brook trout were observed as well. Other game fish in the creek's drainage basin include rainbow trout. smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, and chain pickerel.|$|E

5|$|All {{historical}} eruptions at Kīlauea have <b>occurred</b> <b>at</b> one {{of three}} places: its summit caldera, its eastern rift zone, or its southwestern rift zone.

Recent activity has mostly shifted to Kīlauea's eastern rift zone, the site of 24 historical eruptions, located mostly on its upper section; by contrast, the volcano's southwestern rift zone has been relatively quiet, and has only been the site of five events to date.|$|E
