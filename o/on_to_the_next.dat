5|$|The Antwerp {{flag was}} {{presented}} to the IOC at the 1920 Summer Olympics by the city of Antwerp, Belgium, and was passed <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> organising city of the Summer Olympics through the 1984 Games in Los Angeles, CA, USA.|$|E
5|$|The Oslo {{flag was}} {{presented}} to the IOC at the 1952 Winter Olympics by the city of Oslo, Norway, and is passed <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> organising city of the Winter Olympics.|$|E
5|$|The {{black-throated blue warbler}} forages {{actively}} in low vegetation, sometimes hovering or catching insects in flight. It often forages in one area {{for a while before}} moving <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next.</b> It mainly eats invertebrates such as caterpillars, crane flies, and spiders. It may supplement its diet with seeds, berries, and fruit in the winter.|$|E
50|$|After the Roadblock, {{teams were}} {{directed}} <b>to</b> travel <b>on</b> foot <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> Pit Stop at Mooloolaba Yacht Club.|$|R
50|$|Clinton went <b>on</b> <b>to</b> win <b>the</b> <b>next</b> {{five states}} in the Democratic primary, {{including}} Ohio, Illinois and Missouri.|$|R
50|$|After being {{released}} by Achilles, van Bochoven returned to Haaglandia, only <b>to</b> move <b>on</b> <b>to</b> Westlandia <b>the</b> <b>next</b> season.|$|R
5|$|A level ends {{when all}} of the point-scoring objects are gone - either lost down the drain, cleaned by sponges/brushes, eaten by roaches, or absorbed by the bubble. At this point, if the bubble is large enough to have a {{complete}} face, the player moves <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> level; otherwise, one life is lost and the level must be replayed. In addition, whenever the bubble has a face, the drain flashes green, giving the player a chance to enter it and skip the next level. Entering the drain while the bubble is too small costs one life.|$|E
5|$|Conquest, the single-player tournament career mode, pits the player's team {{against the}} ranked {{hierarchy}} {{en route to}} the championship. Up to three additional human players can join in the single-player. Players initially choose between four teams, though 13 total are unlockable. Teams begin with four players with no alternates for substitution, and fight their way from fourth place in the Rookie Division to first place against each team in between. Players can continue to take challenges within the division before irrevocably moving <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> division.|$|E
5|$|In {{works from}} Jeux vénitiens, Lutosławski wrote long {{passages}} {{in which the}} parts of the ensemble are not to be synchronised exactly. At cues from the conductor each instrumentalist may be instructed to move straight <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> section, to finish their current section before moving on, or to stop. In this way the random elements within compositionally controlled limits defined by the term aleatory are carefully directed by the composer, who controls the architecture and harmonic progression of the piece precisely. Lutosławski notated the music exactly; there is no improvisation, no choice of parts is given to any instrumentalist, and there is thus no doubt about how the musical performance is to be realised.|$|E
50|$|Album cover artwork for Low was {{designed}} by Dave McKean. He would go <b>on</b> <b>to</b> do <b>the</b> <b>next</b> two Testament studio album covers Demonic (1997) and The Gathering (1999).|$|R
50|$|In 1897, Gustav Hügel became <b>the</b> first Austrian <b>to</b> win a World {{title in}} figure skating. In 1922, Herma Szabo won Austria's first World ladies' title. She would go <b>on</b> <b>to</b> win <b>the</b> <b>next</b> four World Championships.|$|R
25|$|The {{reasons for}} Brown's {{departure}} were never fully disclosed, but it started {{a downward spiral}} that continued for many years; indeed, Blackpool went <b>on</b> <b>to</b> spend <b>the</b> <b>next</b> 29 years in the lower two divisions of the Football League.|$|R
5|$|One {{argument}} leveled by Westmoreland at {{the time}} (and often quoted by historians of the battle) was that only two Marine regiments were tied down at Khe Sanh compared with several NVA divisions. But, {{at the time}} Hanoi {{made the decision to}} move in around the base, Khe Sanh was held by only two (or even just one) American battalions. It is debatable whether the destruction of one battalion could have been the goal of two to four NVA divisions. Yet, even if Westmoreland believed his statement, his argument never moved <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> logical level. By the end of January 1968, he had moved half of all US combat troops—nearly fifty maneuver battalions—to I Corps.|$|E
5|$|The course {{consisted}} of eight obstacles {{which had to}} be completed within 60 seconds. Each obstacle had an orange flag either at its end or hidden within it. One team member ran the first obstacle, then passed its flag to a partner, who then moved <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> obstacle. The team continued to alternate in this manner until they had completed the course or until time ran out. For safety reasons, team members were given helmets, elbow pads, and knee pads to wear while running the course.|$|E
5|$|Thorfinn the Mighty was {{a son of}} Sigurd and a {{grandson}} of King Máel Coluim mac Cináeda (Malcolm II of Scotland). Along with Sigurd's other sons he ruled Orkney {{during the first half}} of the 11th century and extended his authority over a small maritime empire stretching from Dublin to Shetland. Thorfinn died around 1065 and his sons Paul and Erlend succeeded him, fighting at the Battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066. Paul and Erlend quarreled as adults and this dispute carried <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> generation. The martyrdom of Magnus Erlendsson, who was killed in April 1116 by his cousin Haakon Paulsson, resulted in the building of St. Magnus Cathedral, still today a dominating feature of Kirkwall.|$|E
5|$|Gala {{finished}} the first heat {{with a time}} of 13:21.21, finishing 10th. Although the first five from each heat move <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> finals, <b>the</b> <b>next</b> five fastest times are also qualified, and Gala was fifth on that list. Gala was close to his personal record of 13:17.77 in the first heat, but he {{finished the}} final {{with a time of}} 13:50.26 and placed 13th overall, out of a field of 43 athletes.|$|R
50|$|Following {{his playing}} {{career with the}} Victorian state team Jones was {{selected}} as team coach. As coach for Victoria won {{he won his first}} Goodall Cup in 1965. Following the 1965 win Victoria went <b>on</b> <b>to</b> win <b>the</b> <b>next</b> three years of the Goodall Cup under Jones as coach.|$|R
50|$|Geremi {{made his}} Newcastle debut {{on the opening}} day of the 2007-08 FA Premier League season in a 3-1 away win over Bolton Wanderers, going <b>on</b> <b>to</b> start <b>the</b> <b>next</b> six games for Newcastle before being an unused {{substitute}} in the League Cup third round defeat at Arsenal.|$|R
5|$|Each level casts {{players as}} a {{different}} colored Yoshi, who must escort Baby Mario {{on his back}} and reach the end of the level, where he is passed <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> Yoshi. Similar to Super Mario World, Yoshi can use his tongue to ensnare enemies and put them into his mouth. When something is in his mouth, Yoshi can either spit it out as an attack, or swallow it to turn it into an egg. These eggs can then be thrown at an angle, even bouncing off walls, to attack enemies or reach far away or hard to reach items. Yoshi can carry up to six eggs at a time, with some colored eggs spawning items once they hit something. Yoshi can also eat watermelons that let him spit out seeds, or flaming enemies that let him spit out fire. Yoshi is also able to perform a flutter jump, in which he can kick his legs in mid-air to gain extra height or hover over long distances, and a ground pound, a downward attack that can hammer down on enemies and stumps.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after being}} hired {{he was taken}} aside by the news {{producer}} and asked to read the on-air bulletin for the nightly broadcast. He read the news for three months until one night when he condensed a six-minute bulletin into three minutes. He attributed this to stage fright, which caused him to speak too fast. The rest of the production crew were not ready to move <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> news items, leaving Harries standing in silence for several minutes. Harries recalled in a 2007 interview that Steve Morrison, the producer of the bulletin, called him {{into his office and}} berated him, telling him he did not deserve to be on television and that he would no longer be reading the news. Morrison's remarks angered Harries to such a point that he assaulted the man. Aware {{that he was going to}} lose his job, he contacted a Granada colleague who got him a new job at Granada's London centre, which he took up at the age of 23.|$|E
5|$|The aim of {{the game}} remains the same from its predecessor: {{complete}} increasingly difficult challenges to move <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> race. The difficulty level is changed by increasing the top speed of the craft, through four different classes (Vector, Venom, Rapier and Phantom). The number of laps needed to complete a race also increased with each new class. Victory in the challenge modes is the game's ultimate accomplishment. These modes are similar to a championship where players have to race every track to become champion; however, rather than tallying up points, Challenge mode takes a very single player-centric approach by only allowing progress to the next track by coming in first on the current track. Players can lose the mode by losing all three lives, which are lost by finishing a race in worse than third position. By winning all the races, the player is crowned champion and given access to faster modes, new tracks and ultimately the Piranha craft.|$|E
50|$|Benjamin also {{demonstrated}} his commitment <b>to</b> passing <b>on</b> his knowledge <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> generation by functioning as the stamp club advisor at two Broward County high schools.|$|R

5|$|Of <b>the</b> six matches <b>to</b> {{have been}} played <b>to</b> date, <b>the</b> ACA African XI has only won one match: the inaugural match at Centurion. However, they went <b>on</b> <b>to</b> lose <b>the</b> <b>next</b> ODI, and <b>the</b> final match of the 2005 {{competition}} was called off due to rain, leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> trophy was shared.|$|R
5|$|The common {{starling}} is a noisy bird. Its song {{consists of}} a wide variety of both melodic and mechanical-sounding noises as part of a ritual succession of sounds. The male is the main songster and engages in bouts of song lasting for a minute or more. Each of these typically includes four varieties of song type, which follow each other in a regular order without pause. The bout starts with a series of pure-tone whistles and these are followed by the main part of the song, a number of variable sequences that often incorporate snatches of song mimicked from other species of bird and various naturally occurring or man-made noises. The structure and simplicity of the sound mimicked is of greater importance than the frequency with which it occurs. In some instances, a wild starling has been observed to mimic a sound it has heard only once. Each sound clip is repeated several times before the bird moves <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next.</b> After this variable section comes a number of types of repeated clicks followed by a final burst of high-frequency song, again formed of several types. Each bird has its own repertoire with more proficient birds having a range of up to 35 variable song types and as many as 14 types of clicks.|$|E
5|$|Unlike its predecessor, Panic on Funkotron is a side-scrolling {{platform}} game {{in which}} up to two players play as ToeJam and Earl as they travel across Funkotron to capture antagonistic Earthlings that had stowed away. Players accomplish this by using a radar to locate an Earthling's proximity (some Earthlings may be hidden in the environment) and attack them with jars in order to trap and collect them. Once all Earthlings have been found, the player can move <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> level. Players can collect presents containing various bonuses, such as super jars, radar scans, and teleporting moves. Coins {{can be used with}} parking meters to trigger events in the environment or participate in minigames such as Jam Outs and Fungus Olympics. Players can also enter gateways leading to the Hyper Funk Zone, where the player must avoid obstacles in order to earn more presents. Hidden throughout the game are ten objects belonging to Lamont the Funkapotamus; collecting all of which will earn the player the best ending upon completion.|$|E
5|$|An individual's {{mitochondrial}} {{genes are}} not inherited {{by the same}} mechanism as nuclear genes. Typically, the mitochondria are inherited from one parent only. In humans, when an egg cell is fertilized by a sperm, the egg nucleus and sperm nucleus each contribute equally to the genetic makeup of the zygote nucleus. In contrast, the mitochondria, and therefore the mitochondrial DNA, usually come from the egg only. The sperm's mitochondria enter the egg, but do not contribute genetic information to the embryo. Instead, paternal mitochondria are marked with ubiquitin to select them for later destruction inside the embryo. The egg cell contains relatively few mitochondria, but it is these mitochondria that survive and divide to populate {{the cells of the}} adult organism. Mitochondria are, therefore, in most cases inherited only from mothers, a pattern known as maternal inheritance. This mode is seen in most organisms, including the majority of animals. However, mitochondria in some species can sometimes be inherited paternally. This is the norm among certain coniferous plants, although not in pine trees and yews. For Mytilids, paternal inheritance only occurs within males of the species. It has been suggested that it occurs at a very low level in humans. There is a recent suggestion that mitochondria that shorten male lifespan stay in the system because they are inherited only through the mother. By contrast, natural selection weeds out mitochondria that reduce female survival as such mitochondria {{are less likely to be}} passed <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> generation. Therefore, it is suggested that human females and female animals tend to live longer than males. The authors claim that this is a partial explanation.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Vickers, {{with new}} crew chief Kevin Hamlin, {{qualified}} for the fiftieth running of the Daytona 500 after racing himself in the field with an eleventh-place finish in the Gatorade Duel. He went <b>on</b> <b>to</b> make <b>the</b> <b>next</b> four races with an average finish of twenty-first including a ninth-place finish at Atlanta.|$|R

50|$|He {{was elected}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first Legislative Assembly of Delhi in 1993, and went <b>on</b> <b>to</b> win <b>the</b> <b>next</b> three {{elections}} in 1998, 2003 and 2008. He {{also served as}} {{the speaker of the}} second (1998-2003) and the third (2004-2008) Assemblies. In 2013, he lost <b>the</b> election <b>to</b> Aam Aadmi Party's Ashok Kumar, coming third.|$|R
5|$|The 30th Infantry Division {{began its}} advance on 2 October, using divisional heavy {{artillery}} to target German pillboxes; {{even then it}} took, on average, thirty minutes to capture a single pillbox. The Americans found that if they failed to immediately press <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> pillbox, the Germans were sure to counterattack. Heavy resistance had not been expected, and one company lost 87 combatants in an hour; another lost 93 out of 120soldiers to a German artillery strike. The attackers were slowly able to cross the Wurm River and engage German pillboxes with flamethrowers and explosive charges. By the afternoon of 2 October, elements of the 30th Infantry Division had breached German defenses and reached the town of Palenberg. Here, GIs advanced house-to-house and fought a number of gruesome hand grenade duels. (Private Harold G. Kiner would be awarded the Medal of Honor for throwing himself on a German grenade near Palenberg, thus saving the lives of two fellow soldiers). Fighting {{in the town of}} Rimburg was equally terrible; American armor {{had not been able to}} get across the Wurm River, and therefore could not provide fire support to infantrymen who were attempting to storm a medieval castle being used as a fort by the Germans. The 30th Infantry Division subdued roughly 50 German pillboxes on the first day of the advance, often having to envelop the structure and attack from the rear. The division's effort was aided by the 29th Infantry Division's diversionary attacks on their flank, leading the Germans to believe that that was the Americans' main attack. On the night of 2 October, the German 902nd Assault Gun Battalion was ordered to launch a counterattack against the 30th Infantry Division, but Allied artillery delayed the start of the raid, and ultimately the attempt failed.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} premièred on August 26, 2010 on Vevo, and was {{directed}} by Hiro Murai. The video begins in a club environment, with misplaced furniture and a shattered glass bottle. The scene goes in reverse motion, people instantly appear, frozen in a raving action. As the scene is still reversing a DJ is spinning his booth, and the shattered glass bottle forms into its original state, the clubbers and the scene then start to move in forward but slow motion and the song begins with Usher approaching from a set of stairs. Usher sings and dances, whilst moving past clubbers who are still moving in slow motion whilst he is in moving normally. Once the chorus comes in, the clubbers begin dancing and raving in normal motion, periodically slowing down; Usher is krumping pass them, moving <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> scene. Usher slides into {{a room with a}} large lit up window as a back drop. He performs choreography backed-up by female dancers for the second verse, and then returns to the original room with the second chorus coming in. A similar scene is involved to the first chorus, but this time Usher is dancing with the clubbers, who are still alternating in motion speed. Pitbull then begins his verse, and is sat in a V.I.P. area with three females, with the camera alternating between him, the clubbers and Usher. The video ends with its final scene, in a dance off, with Usher dancing adjacent to some of the clubbers. Once the climax of the chorus comes in, Usher jumps in the air and starts freely dancing along with the clubbers, with everyone in the same motion speed; Usher is primarily crip-walking. Usher and the clubbers then perform a final organised choreography, mainly krumping, and the video ends.|$|E
