5|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Sophie Muller and directing collaborative Logan. It opens with a sequence of Stefani, as shown {{on the cover of}} the CD single, removing several pieces of clothing and later lying <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed.</b> After a scene with her in front of a white heart with roses, bassist Tony Kanal and drummer Adrian Young play basketball while Stefani stands against the wall. Stefani is then shown against a sparkling sky, followed by a scene of the whole band bicycling during Lady Saw's toast. The video closes with a scene of Stefani jumping <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> in white undergarments and without makeup.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{countries}} expressed concern about unliveable conditions, with The Times of India reporting that the Scottish delegation apparently submitted {{a photograph of a}} dog defecating <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> in the Games Village. Secretary general of the Organising Committee Lalit Bhanot countered the complaints of poor sanitation when he claimed that cultural differences accounted for differing standards of cleanliness in India and the western world. He was subsequently ridiculed by both the Indian and international media.|$|E
5|$|In autumn, Granpa and Emily went fishing, and {{imagined}} of catching a whale that haled {{them through the}} Thames and through London. At bedtime, Granpa tells Emily the story of The Three Knights, of which was imagined <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> covers. Though as he reads, he begins to slow up as he begins to drop off. So he end it with his own version, just as Emily was finally going to sleep.|$|E

40|$|During a {{study of}} dietary effects on {{reproductive}} efficiency in female rats, high mortality among the sucking pups was observed in both control and experi-mental groups. This mortality was attributed to keeping the pups <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bedding</b> of highly aromatic cedar-wood shavings. The experiment described demonstrates this effect and warns of the hazards in raising rat pups <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bedding</b> of cedar-wood shavings. Pick & Little (1965) have shown that keeping rats <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bedding</b> of cedar-wood shavings affected the thresholds of response to pentylenetetrazol, but no studies {{of the effects of}} such bedding on pup growth and mortality have been reported. The present experiment also describes the suitability of rat bedding materials consisting of ground corncobs and shredded aspen shavings.

5|$|Basingstoke is {{situated}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> of cretaceous upper chalk with small areas of clayey and loamy soil, inset with combined clay and flint patches. Loam and alluvium recent and pleistocene sediments line {{the bed of}} the river Loddon. A narrow line of tertiary Reading beds run diagonally from the northwest to the southeast along a line from Sherborne St John throughPopley, Daneshill and the north part of Basing. To the north of this line, encompassing the areas of Chineham and Pyotts Hill, is London clay, which has in the past allowed excavation for high quality brick and tile manufacture.|$|E
5|$|Even {{within the}} Bond canon, Goldfinger is acknowledged; the 22nd Bond film, Quantum of Solace, {{includes}} {{an homage to}} the gold body paint death scene by having a female character dead <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> nude, covered in crude oil. Outside the Bond films, elements of Goldfinger, such as Oddjob and his use of his hat as a weapon, Bond removing his drysuit to reveal a tuxedo underneath and the laser scene have been homaged or spoofed in works such as True Lies, The Simpsons, and the Austin Powers series. The US television programme MythBusters explored many scenarios seen in the film, such as the explosive depressurisation in a plane at high altitudes, the death by full body painting, an ejector seat {{in a car and}} using a tuxedo under a drysuit.|$|E
5|$|Francis has {{individualized}} features, to {{the point}} that the attention to his face gives it the quality of a portrait such as van Eyck's c. 1431 Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati. The head and face are minutely detailed. Francis is in his mid-thirties, wears stubble and has a somewhat jowly face and receding hairline. He is presented as a highly intelligent but perhaps detached and impassive individual. He is given a complex and inscrutable expression; physiological traits not uncommon in contemporary Flemish painting. He kneels <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> of flowers, and his heavy robe and folded drapery have a choppy and overflowing feel. His lower limbs seem disconnected, positioned in an anti-naturalistic manner; giving the impression that he is levitating.|$|E

5|$|Hopes {{that the}} ballet {{would be ready}} in May were dashed and the opening night was {{postponed}} several times. Grisi was absent {{for a few days}} and her return was delayed to protect her health. Lighting, trapdoors, and scene changes needed further rehearsals. Cuts were made in Grisi's role to spare the dancer's health. Instead of returning to her tomb {{at the end of the}} ballet, it was decided that she would be placed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> of flowers and sink slowly into the earth. This touch preserved the romantic mood of the Act II finale.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Criss Angel {{became the}} creator, director, and {{executive}} producer of the A Network show Criss Angel Mindfreak, and had entered production in January. Seasons 1 and 2 were filmed at The Aladdin in Las Vegas, with Season 3 at the Luxor Las Vegas. Premiering on July 20, 2005, the show's illusions included walking on water, levitating, walking up the side of Luxor Hotel (in the light of 39 focused lamps that can be seen from space), floating between two buildings, causing a Lamborghini to disappear, surviving in an exploding C4 Crate, cutting himself in half in full view of an audience and getting run over by a steamroller while lying <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> of broken glass.|$|E
5|$|The Street House Anglo-Saxon {{cemetery}} is an Anglo-Saxon burial ground, {{dating to}} {{the second half of}} the 7th century AD, that was discovered at Street House Farm near Loftus, in the unitary authority of Redcar and Cleveland, England. Monuments dating back as far as 3300BC are located in the vicinity of the cemetery, which was discovered after aerial photography revealed the existence of an Iron Age rectangular enclosure. The excavations, carried out between 2005 and 2007, revealed over a hundred graves dating from the 7th century AD and the remains of several buildings. An array of jewellery and other artefacts was found, including the jewels once worn by a young high-status Anglo-Saxon woman who had been buried <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> and covered by an earth mound.|$|E

She is then introduced wearing a black hat and white shirt with a tie, while a crowd {{of male and female}} dancers perform a synchronized choreography. Following this, Stan makes an appearance wearing a white dress, and {{a police car}} is shown arriving. Subsequently, two policemen {{get out of the car}} in order to search for Stan. However, they do not find her in the bed and the video ends with Stan leaving the building and the men watching material recorded by the surveillance cameras.|$|E
5|$|The club badge is in {{the form}} of a shield, divided diagonally into two parts; the smaller section, to the upper right, {{is in the}} club's home colour of white, the larger is red, their {{traditional}} away colour. In the white section is a stylised Quaker hat, emblematic of the major role played by the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in the history of the town. The larger section depicts George Stephenson's Locomotion No 1, the steam locomotive that hauled the first train on the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825, representing the importance of the railway industry to the area. Across the bottom of the shield is a ribbon bearing the club's nickname, The Quakers, and the whole rests <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> of oak leaves, symbolic of strength and endurance.|$|E
5|$|The {{coat of arms}} {{includes}} a depiction of the city wall, and two silver strips representing the River Avon and the hot springs. The sword of St. Paul is a link to Bath Abbey.

The knight's helmet indicates a municipality and the crown is that of King Edgar (referencing his coronation at the Abbey). A mural crown, indicating a city, is alternatively used instead of the helmet and Edgar's crown.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by head writer Neil Cross. It was also {{additionally}} written by Ben Richards. The plot of the episode {{was influenced by the}} resurgence of power in Russia following the end of the Cold War, which the producers felt in subtle ways is threatening the security of the West. The producers also included scenes that would show Lucas adjusting to the outside world following eight years of imprisonment, to show how emotionally damaged the character is, and make the audience realise he is struggling. One of the scenes include Lucas struggling to sleep <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed,</b> and soon resorts to lying on the floor instead.|$|E
5|$|The {{first episode}} starts with Kills furiously {{walking with a}} {{revolver}} in direction of a blonde man; she later ties him up <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed,</b> as he screams and tries to resist. Kills calls a friend whose name is not revealed, and asks him for help. During the second episode, Kills assassinates another man and takes his photograph; the next episode, she is arrested by a group—played by Far East Movement—who threaten her. She manages to strangle {{the leader of the}} group, and later leaves a message for her anonymous friend, warning him that her face is being distributed on wanted posters.|$|E

When Steinman's manager saw it, he responded 'It's a porno movie!' The two-day shoot ran over schedule and budget, costing £35,000 an hour. Russell and Steinman even designed a sequence where a motorcyclist would cycle up the steps of a local church-tower, jump out of the turrets at the top, and then explode; alas, the wardens of the church refused permission.|$|E

50|$|The lowest odd {{prime number}} is three. Wike {{illustrates}} how this yields an unbalanced design with an invented {{study in which}} researchers investigated the effects on sexual satisfaction of water beds. The fictitious researchers randomly assigned couples to three groups: those having sex <b>on</b> <b>a</b> conventional <b>bed,</b> those having sex <b>on</b> <b>a</b> water <b>bed,</b> and those having sex <b>on</b> <b>a</b> water <b>bed</b> having also taken a sea sickness pill. Wike pointed out that any differences in sexual satisfaction among the three groups {{could be due to}} the water bed or to the sea sickness pill. It requires a fourth group, couples taking the pill and using <b>a</b> conventional <b>bed,</b> to balance the design and to allow the researchers to attribute any differences in sexual satisfaction among the groups to the sort of bed, to the pill, or to their interaction.|$|R
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with showing Madonna, the torero (Muñoz), and the townspeople {{preparing}} for, then attending, a bullfight. A secondary staging {{in the video}} presents Madonna standing or sitting near a television set in a room (lit by a single light source from above), while a third staging depicts Madonna writhing around <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> in her underwear as she watches Muñoz on the television. In the bullring, the torero kills the bull and then comes home and physically and emotionally abuses Madonna. The video {{can be viewed as}} a statement on classicism, supposing the bullfighter feels threatened and angered by the aristocrat's station, resulting in his physically abusing and then coldly abandoning her.|$|E
5|$|The video focuses {{solely on}} lead singer, Jason Wade, {{as the rest}} of the band members do not appear in the video. The video begins by showing Wade sitting alone <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed,</b> with {{pictures}} of him and his girlfriend on the wall. He proceeds to walk around the house, while various things in the room he's in begin to explode around him, such as the bed and pictures in the bedroom, and various food and drink items in the kitchen. Near the end things begin going in reverse, and everything that had exploded is put back together. The video ends with Wade sitting back on the bed with his girlfriend now lying next to him.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} {{a shot of the}} outside view of The Confidante hotel and two flamingos. In the next scene, and {{in the context of the}} track, Lipa is lying <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed,</b> {{thinking}} of giving her ex a second chance, while her friends are by her side. As the song continues, the artist heads towards the phone to answer his call, but is stopped by one of her friends. Then, she keeps receiving advice from the women, but manages to escape to the hallway. There, they perform a choreography, and return to the room. In the next scenes, the women start a sleepover, brushing each other's hair and applying lipstick on each other. They change their outfits and head towards the pool, where they walk over the water.|$|E
