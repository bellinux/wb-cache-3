40|$|ABSTRACT This {{publication}} {{is part of}} {{a series}} that will constitute an Atlas of Teleostei Otoliths for the Southeastern-Southern Brazilian area. It presents the results of the morphological and morphometric analyses <b>of</b> 31 Perciformes (<b>two</b> species <b>of</b> Centropomidae; <b>two</b> <b>of</b> Acropomatidae; <b>two</b> <b>of</b> Serranidae; <b>two</b> <b>of</b> Priacanthidae; <b>two</b> <b>of</b> Malacanthidae; one of Pomatomidae; six of Carangidae; three of Lutjanidae; five of Gerreidae and six of Haemulidae). Whenever available in the collection, otoliths from three distinct specimen sizes were illustrated and photographed in order to show their variation during development. For each characteristic the frequency of occurrence was calculated within each length class (TL) and among length classes (during development) and differences were analyzed by a multiple &# 967;² test (significance 0. 05) ...|$|R
50|$|Before 1948 {{there was}} no {{professional}} football league in Colombia. The first clubs were formed in Barranquilla and Bogotá: Barranquilla FC, Polo Club, Escuela Militar and Bartolinos, although the game {{took a while to}} develop in popularity. The 1918 Campeonato Nacional was the first tournament played between Colombian clubs, followed by the Copa Centenario Batalla de Boyacá. Independiente Medellín, founded on 15 April 1913, is the oldest club that remains as a professional club.The first tournament was organised by Colombian Football Federation and DIMAYOR in 1948. In the tournament 10 teams signed up (each had to pay a fee of 1,000 pesos): one <b>of</b> Barranquilla, <b>two</b> <b>of</b> Bogotá, <b>two</b> <b>of</b> Cali, <b>two</b> <b>of</b> Manizales, <b>two</b> <b>of</b> Medellín and <b>two</b> <b>of</b> Pereira. 252 players were registered as follows: 182 Colombians, 13 Argentines, 8 Peruvians, 5 Uruguayans, 2 Chileans, 2 Ecuadorians, 1 Dominican and 1 Spanish.|$|R
