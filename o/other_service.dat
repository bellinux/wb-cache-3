On the Red Line, every other train bound for Shady Grove terminates at Grosvenor-Strathmore, in {{addition}} to the alternating terminations at Silver Spring mentioned above. For the Yellow Line, all trains bound for Fort Totten terminate at Mount Vernon Square. These are primarily instituted due to a limited supply of rail cars and the locations of pocket tracks throughout the system.|$|E

5|$|As {{chair of}} Bloomington Conservation Project, Horch and the Master Institute of United Arts led {{an effort to}} improve {{deteriorated}} housing by converting single-family brownstone buildings into rent-subsidized apartments. Efforts like those of this project ameliorated conditions to some extent, but the Bloomingdale area {{did not return to}} prosperity until the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the city as a whole experienced an economic rebound. As high-paying white-collar employment in financial institutions and <b>other</b> <b>service</b> industries replaced long-departed blue-collar jobs in the industrial sector, real estate speculators found that they could profit from new condos and co-ops either by replacing old buildings or by renovating them.|$|E

Either a snowplow attachment can be mounted on the loader's arm in place of the bucket, or the bucket or snowbasket can be used to load snow into the rear compartment of a snowplow or dump truck, which then hauls it away. Snowplows are dangerous to overtake; often, the oncoming lane may not be completely free of snow. In addition, the plow blade causes considerable spray of snow on both sides, which can obscure the vision of other road users.|$|E

5|$|Nallur, {{the capital}} was built with four entrances with gates. There were two main roadways and four temples {{at the four}} gateways. The rebuilt temples that exist now do not match their {{original}} locations which instead are occupied by churches erected by the Portuguese. The {{center of the city}} was Muthirai Santhai (market place) and was surrounded by a square fortification around it. There were courtly buildings for the Kings, Brahmin priests, soldiers and <b>other</b> <b>service</b> providers. The old Nallur Kandaswamy temple functioned as a defensive fort with high walls. In general, the city was laid out like the traditional temple town according to Hindu traditions.|$|E
5|$|Opposite the entrance, {{and running}} across {{the middle of the}} court, was the great hall of the castle, with a grand porch and steps leading up to the first floor, where prestigious guests would have been entertained amongst carved wall-panels and murals. The design of the hall may have {{emulated}} Gaunt's hall at Kenilworth; at the very least, it was a powerful symbol of Thomas's authority and status. The west side of the inner court included the castle kitchen, bakery, well and <b>other</b> <b>service</b> facilities; on the east side was the lord's great chamber and a range of other accommodation for other guests. Behind the great hall was a smaller courtyard or garden. Thomas appears to have built up his new castle in stages, with the curtain wall being built first, with the corner towers added afterwards.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} castle {{centred on}} a stone tower-keep, measuring 60 feet by 24 feet (18 m by 7 m) internally and 54 feet (16 m) tall, with four round corner-towers. The tower-keep had eight-foot (2.4 m) thick walls made from Lias Oolite ashlar stone and was designed around three floors. The corner towers had conical roofs and prominent machicolations. The ground floor of the tower-house included the kitchen and <b>other</b> <b>service</b> areas. The functions {{of the first and}} second floors are uncertain; one theory is that the first floor was another service area, with the hall on the second floor; another approach argues that the first floor formed the hall, and the second floor living accommodation; a minority view proposes that the first floor was an armoury. The third floor was used as living accommodation for the owning family. The original design had a number of windows and fireplaces on the upper floors, but the hall would have been relatively dark and the stairs were inconveniently narrow.|$|E

5|$|Brown was {{classified}} 1-A in 1944 and commissioned as a {{lieutenant in the}} U.S. Navy. He served at the Great Lakes Naval Training Station outside Chicago as head coach of its Bluejacket football team, which competed against <b>other</b> <b>service</b> teams and college programs. The station was a waypoint for Navy recruits between training and active service in World War II, but its commanders took athletics seriously and saw winning as a morale-booster and a point of personal pride. Brown could have been called up for active duty – Tony Hinkle, his predecessor, was already serving in the Pacific – but the war began to wind down as Brown arrived. Brown had little time to institute his system, and instead adopted Hinkle's offensive scheme, borrowed from the Chicago Bears. He had a smattering of talented players, including defensive end George Young and halfback Ara Parseghian. In 1944, the team lost to Ohio State and Notre Dame, but finished with a 9–2–1 record and was among the top 20 teams in the AP Poll.|$|E
5|$|The range {{along the}} western curtain wall dates from about 1480, when the fourth earl remodelled the bailey. The great hall was the social hub of the castle, where the {{household}} gathered to eat. The now-ruined 15th-century building replaced an earlier hall on the same site, dating from about 1200, {{although some of the}} stone dates from the mid 12thcentury. The earl would have entered from the south from his connecting private chambers, and people of lower status through the Lion Tower. Internally, it was split into two aisles of differing width. Both halls were heated by open hearths, two of which survive from the earlier hall. Opposite ends of the hall were for opposite ends of the social scale within the castle. The high end (next to the withdrawing chamber) was for the earl and his family, and the low end (next to the kitchen and <b>other</b> <b>service</b> rooms) {{for the rest of the}} household. In the medieval period, the great hall was richly decorated with tapestries.|$|E
