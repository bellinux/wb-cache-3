40|$|For {{a general}} class of {{symmetrical}} pencil-beam antennas, the gain {{at a given}} off-axis angle can be maximized by choosing the proper antenna size. The maximum gain at the given angle relative to the <b>on-axis</b> <b>gain</b> is independent of the given angle and dependent only on the main-beam pattern. It is computed here for four commonly used gain functions. Its value, in all cases, is close to 4 dB.

An expression describing {{the influence of the}} struts on the axial gain, in both the near and far fields, is derived {{as a function of the}} number of struts and their width. It is found that, for typical systems, the struts degrade the <b>on-axis</b> <b>gain</b> by less than 0. 4 dB, and the first side-lobe level is not increased significantly. Contour plots have also been included to show the symmetry of the far-field distributions for three- and four-support members...|$|E

40|$|The biophysical {{properties}} of the external ear of the Tammar wallaby, Macropus eugenii (Desmarest), have been investigated using probe microphones implanted in the ear canal. An acoustic axis of the pinna exists above 2 kHz which is located close to the horizonal plane for natural ear positions, whereas azimuthal location of the acoustic axis is determined by pinna orientation on the head. The maximum <b>on-axis</b> acoustic pressure <b>gain</b> of the external ear reaches 25 - 30 dB for frequencies near 5 kHz. This results from pressure transformation by the horn-like pinna combined with resonance of the auditory meatus. The directionality of the pinna {{is similar to the}} sound diffraction {{properties of}} a circular aperture with an average radius based on the circumference of the pinna face. These properties determine the acceptance angle of the main lobe containing the acoustic axis and the spatial location of nulls. Large binaural intensity differences, exceeding 30 dB, can be produced by the interaction of peaks and nulls between monaural directivity patterns, depending on the relative position of each pinna...|$|R
40|$|Investigations of {{the factors}} that limit average power scaling of {{elemental}} copper vapor lasers (CVLs) have demonstrated that decay of the electron density in the interpulse period is critical in restricting pulse repetition rate and laser aperture scaling. We have recently developed the 'kinetic enhancement' (or KE) technique to overcome these limitations, whereby optimal plasma conditions are engineered using low concentrations of HCl/H₂ additive gases in the Ne buffer. Dissociative electron attachment of HCl and subsequent mutual neutralization of Cl⁻ and Cu⁺ promote rapid plasma relaxation and fast recovery of Cu densities, permitting operation at elevated Cu densities and pulse rates for given apertures. Using this approach, we have demonstrated increases in output power and efficiency of a factor of 2 or higher over conventional CVLs of the same size. For a 38 mm- bore KE-CVL, output powers up to 150 W have been achieved at 22 kHz, corresponding to record specific powers (80 mW/cm³) for such a 'small/medium-scale' device. In addition, kinetic enhancement significantly extends the gain duration and restores <b>gain</b> <b>on-axis,</b> even for high pulse rates, thereby promoting substantial increases (5 - 10 x) in high- beam-quality power levels when operating with unstable resonators. This has enabled us to achieve much higher powers in second-harmonic generation from the visible copper laser output to the ultraviolet (e. g. 5 W at 255 nm from a small- scale KE-CVL). Our approach to developing KE-CVLs including computer modeling and experimental studies will be reviewed, and most recent results in pulse rate scaling and scaling of high-beam-quality power using oscillator-amplifier configurations, will be presented. 12 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The Large Scale Polarisation Explorer (LSPE) is a balloon-borne {{experiment}} {{aiming to}} measure the B-mode component of the CMB polarisation at large angular scales. Onboard LSPE, the Short Wavelength Instrument for the Polarisation Explorer (SWIPE) is a bolometric polarimeter observing in three bands centred at 140, 220 and 240 GHz. The telescope is a single large-diameter plano-convex lens with a cold aperture stop. A small number of multi-mode feed horns feeding bolometric detectors are used within the focal plane, achieving a sensitivity equivalent to that of 100 ’s of single-mode horns. Simulations have been performed to predict the multi-mode optical response of the horn-lens configuration for centre and off-axis pixels pertaining to each frequency band. The horn has been simulated to a high accuracy using the Method of Moments. Using the horn simulation result as a source, the optical response of the lens has been examined using the more approximate simulation technique; Ray-Launching Geometrical Optics (RL-GO). Solution accuracy and simulation time depend heavily on the choice of RL-GO simulation parameters including: mesh size; the number of launched rays; and how densely the horn source beam is sampled. Individual convergence studies have been performed {{for each of these}} parameters and a final model has been obtained as a compromise between simulation time and accuracy. The instrumental polarisation of the lens is predicted to be at the - 50 dB level. Finally, the optimal location of where to place the telescope focus in relation to the horn to maximise <b>on-axis</b> <b>gain</b> has been investigated. Several techniques agreed that the ‘phase centre’ is around 20 mm behind the horn aperture at 140 GHz, increasing to 30 mm at 220 and 240 GHz.

40|$|The {{initiative}} for starting the Aircraft-to-Satellite Data Relay (ASDAR) Program {{came from a}} recognition {{that much of the}} world's weather originates in the data sparse area of the tropics which are primarily ocean. The ASDAR system consists of (1) a data acquisition and control unit to acquire, store and format these data; (2) a clock to time the data sampling and transmission periods; and (3) a transmitter and low-profile upper hemisphere coverage antenna to relay the formatted data via satellite to the National Weather Service ground stations, as shown schematically. The low-profile antenna is a conformal antenna based on the coplanar-slot approach. The antenna is circular polarized and has an <b>on-axis</b> <b>gain</b> of nearly 2. 5 dB and a HPBW greater than 90 deg.

40|$|With {{over forty}} {{satellites}} in geostationary orbit, {{and many more}} planned, {{it is becoming increasingly}} difficult to find suitable orbit positions for new systems operating at 4 and 6 GHz. Efficient spectrum-orbit utilization can be achieved with frequency-reuse techniques - orthogonal polarization, earth-station antenna discrimination, and satellite antenna discrimination - provided that service-area geography is considered. Service arc - that portion of the orbit which affords useful service to all points in a given area - {{is a function of the}} area's climate, terrain, and location as well as its size and shape. Of the three techniques, satellite antenna discrimination is the most sensitive to these factors. According to the BSS (broadcasting-satellite service) antenna reference pattern, the maximum discrimination possible is the <b>on-axis</b> <b>gain,</b> which can be as high as 49 dB for a beamwidth of 0. 6 degrees, or as low as 32 dB for a 3. 5 -degree beamwidth.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} and fairly self-contained study of centrally obscured optical transmitting and receiving antennas is presented and {{is intended for}} use by the laser radar and communication systems designer. The material is presented in a format which allows the rapid and accurate evaluation of antenna gain. The Fresnel approximation to scalar wave theory is reviewed and the antenna analysis proceeds in terms of the power gain. Conventional range equations may then be used to calculate the power budget. The transmitter calculations, resulting in near and far field antenna gain patterns, assumes the antenna is illuminated by a laser operating in the fundamental cavity mode. A simple equation is derived for matching the incident source distribution to a general antenna configuration for maximum <b>on-axis</b> <b>gain.</b> An interpretation of the resultant gain curves allows a number of auxiliary design curves to be drawn which display the losses in antenna gain due to pointing errors and the cone angle of the outgoing beam as a function of antenna size and central obscuration.

40|$|An {{algorithmic}} {{procedure for}} {{the synthesis of}} planar array feeds for paraboloidal reflectors is described which simultaneously provides electronic correction of systematic reflector surface distortions {{as well as a}} Vernier electronic beamsteering capability. Simple rules of thumb for the optimum chioce of planar array feed configuration (i. e., the number and type of elements) are derived from a parametric study made using the synthesis procedure. A number of f/D ratios and distortion models were examined that are typical of large paraboloidal reflectors. Numerical results are presented showing that, for the range of distortion models considered, good <b>on-axis</b> <b>gain</b> restoration can be achieved with as few as seven elements. For beamsteering to +/- 1 beamwidth (BW), 19 elements are required. For arrays with either 7 or 19 elements, the results indicate that the use of high-aperture-efficiency elements (e. g., disk-on-rod and short backfire) in the array yields higher system gain than can be obtained with elements having lower aperture efficiency (e. g., open-ended waveguides). With 37 elements, excellent gain and beamsteering performance to +/- 1. 5 BW are obtained independent of the assumed effective aperture of the array element. An approximate expression is derived for the focal-plane field distribution of the distorted reflector. Contour plots of the focal-plane fields are also presented for various distortion and beam scan angle cases. The results obtained show the effectiveness of the array feed approach...|$|E

While intermittent pulsars are hard to ﬁnd because of their emission properties, pulsars orbiting near the massive black hole {{in the center of the}} Galaxy have eluded detection because of severe scattering by dense ionized gas. We report the results from three Galactic center pulsar surveys performed with the Green Bank telescope at 9, 5, and 2 GHz. The latter survey discovered three pul- sars whose large dispersion measures and angular proximity to Sgr A* indicate the existence of a Galactic center population of neutron stars. PSR J 1746 − 2850 I has a characteristic spindown age of only 13 kyr along with a high surface magnetic ﬁeld ∼ 4 × 1013 G. It and a second object found in the same telescope pointing, PSR J 1746 − 2850 II, which has the highest known dispersion measure among pulsars, may have originated from recent star formation in the Arches or Quintuplet clusters given their angular locations. Along with a third object, PSR J 1745 − 2910, and two pulsars with similarly high dispersion measures reported by Johnston et al. (2006), the ﬁve objects found so far are 10 ′ − 15 ′ from Sgr A*, consistent with a large pulsar population in the Galactic center, most of whose members are undetectable in relatively low-frequency surveys because of severe scattering broadening.
