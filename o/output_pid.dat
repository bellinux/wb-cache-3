40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to develop the {{knowledge}} about nonlinear and/or adaptive solid fuel boiler control at Vattenfall Utveckling AB. The aim is also to make a study of implemented and published control strategies. A solid fuel boiler is a large-scale heat (and power) generating plant. The Idbäcken boiler studied in this work, is a one hundred MW furnace mainly fired with wood chips. The control system consists of several linear PID controllers working together, and the furnace is a nonlinear system. That, {{and the fact that}} the fuel-flow is not monitored, are the main reasons for the control problems. The system fluctuates periodically and the CO outlets sometimes rise high above the permitted level. There is little work done in the area of advanced boiler control, but some interesting approaches are described in scientific articles. MPC (Model Predictive Control), nonlinear system identification using ANN (Artificial Neural Network), fuzzy logic, Hµ loop shaping and MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple <b>Output)</b> <b>PID</b> tuning methods have been tested with good results. Both linear and nonlinear system identification is performed in the thesis.

The model of BLDCM system is determined by identification model system based on the measuring of dynamic response. The aim of the speed controller is to obtain the speed motor operating similar to a speed setting. The controller input is a speed that measured by speed sensor encoder. The controller output is the voltage to supply the stator windings of BLDCM through pulse wide modulation controller to drive inverter. The controller has three input variables: speed error, actual speed, speed setting and output variable is the signal to determine the voltage value.

40|$|Abstract. An Anti-Windup (AW) {{compensator}} {{is applied}} to the Embedded Cylindrical-Array Magnetic Actuator (ECAMA) to sustain the performance of spindle position regulation for milling machines under actuator saturation. Since ECAMA is a type of Active Magnetic Bearing (AMB), the maximum supplied coil current and the induced magnetic force are both limited by their extrema.
