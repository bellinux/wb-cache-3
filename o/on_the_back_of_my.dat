According to Kelly, he adapted his song [...] "Foggy Highway" [...] for Renée Geyer because [...] "I admired her deep soul singing, ferocious and vulnerable ... When I heard the finished version ... the hairs rose up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> neck." [...] Kelly and The Stormwater Boys recorded it in a bluegrass style as the title track for the 2005 album Foggy Highway. Divinyls' lead singer Christina Amphlett recorded [...] "Before Too Long"—she was attracted by the lyrics—she interpreted the song's narrator as being a stalker, and provided a female perspective in a darkly menacing manner à-la Fatal Attraction.|$|E

I sank to the ground and as I slipped in and out of consciousness, I was dimly aware of the players gathering round my prostrate body.

2500|$|Former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) chief R. James Woolsey, Jr. {{drives a}} Prius {{because of its}} low fuel consumption. Woolsey noted the {{volatility}} of the Middle East, coupled with anti-US sentiment {{in much of the}} region. Noting that the high percentage of oil drilled in the Middle East gives vast profits to Middle Eastern regimes, Woolsey believes that it is a patriotic obligation to drive more efficient vehicles. In a Motor Trend magazine article, Woolsey stated that those oil profits find their way to terrorist groups like al-Qaeda, meaning that Americans who buy inefficient vehicles would, in effect, be indirectly funding terrorism. [...] "We're paying for both sides in this war, and that's not a good long-term strategy," [...] said Woolsey.
