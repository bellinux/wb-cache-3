In addition, we can, according to the prediction result, give out the residual pressure and the smallest pre-drainage rate of gas.

Estimating the intensity of <b>outbursts</b> of <b>coal</b> and gas plays an important role because of its relation with the risk value. In this paper, we described the semiquantitative relations between major parameters and intensity of outburst based on physical experiments.

40|$|Based on the {{desorption}} experiments of coal particles {{with different}} sizes, {{the possibility of}} the existence of coal powders in the outburst development stage was studied from the perspective of energy balance and pneumatic conveying. The energy involved in outbursts (gas expansion energy, transport energy and remaining kinetic energy) and the general range of the transport critical particle size (TCPS, the coal particle size with the lowest gas desorption speed causing the <b>outburst</b> <b>coal</b> transport over a certain distance) were calculated.

40|$|Coal mass has the {{potential}} to store substantial amounts of CO 2 in the coal matrix and that CO 2 has the ability to move through the coal seam pore and fracture systems, which influences the release of gases during coal mining and the CO 2 sequestration process. In addition, the reduction of coal mass strength due to CO 2 adsorption greatly affects the outburst process. The sudden and violent failure of coal seam with releasing large amount of gas is called <b>outburst</b> in <b>coal</b> mining. Up to date only few have been conducted to investigate the effect of CO 2 adsorption induces strength reduction on the outburst process. The main objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the effect of CO 2 injection on <b>outburst</b> in <b>coal</b> mining. Uniaxial Compressive Strength (UCS) experiments were therefore conducted on black coal samples, which have been saturated with CO 2 and N 2 at various pressures at 33 ºC. According to the results CO 2 adsorption causes the UCS strength of coal to be reduced by up to 53 % and this higher strength reduction is due to the CO 2 adsorption induce coal matrix swelling. However, N 2 saturation causes the coal strength to be slightly increased.

40|$|A thin {{coal seam}} mined as a {{protective}} coal seam above a gas <b>outburst</b> <b>coal</b> seam plays {{a central role}} in decreasing the degree of stress placed on a protected seam, thus increasing gas permeability levels and desorption capacities to dramatically eliminate gas outburst risk for the protected seam. However, when multiple layers of coal seams are present, stress-relieved gas from adjacent coal seams can cause a gas explosion. Thus, the post-drainage of gas from fractured and de-stressed strata should be applied. Comprehensive studies of gas permeability evolution mechanisms and gas seepage rules of protected seams close to protective seams that occur during protective seam mining must be carried out. Based on the case of the LongWall (LW) 23209 working face in the Hancheng coal mine, Shaanxi Province, this paper presents a seepage model developed through the FLAC 3 D software program (version 5. 0, Itasca Consulting Group, Inc., Minneapolis, MI, USA) from which gas flow characteristics can be reflected by changes in rock mass permeability.

This process occurs over a reasonable amount of extraction time and in appropriate locations for comprehensive gas extraction technologies.

40|$|Coal mining (especially underground) is {{considered}} one of the most hazardous industries, and as a result considerable focus is applied to eliminating or mitigating hazards through careful mine planning, equipment selection and certification, and development of management systems and procedures. Regulatory agencies have developed in-house methods for reporting, classification and tracking of fatalities and other incidents according to the type of event, often including consideration of different hazard types. Unfortunately, direct comparison of mining safety statistics between countries is confounded by considerable differences in the way that individual countries classify specific fatalities or incidents. This paper presents a comparative analysis of coal mining fatality data in Australia, South Africa, India, China and the United States from 2006 to 2010. Individual classification definitions are compared between the five countries, and methods presented to normalise each country’s hazard definitions and reporting regimes around the RISKGATE framework of seventeen different priority unwanted events (or topics). Fatality data from individual countries is then re-classified according to the different RISKGATE topics, thereby enabling a comparative analysis between all five countries.

30|$|An <b>outburst</b> of <b>coal</b> and gas is {{the rapid}} {{release of a}} large {{quantity}} of gas {{in conjunction with the}} ejection of coal and possibly associated rock, into the working face in underground coal mines. With an increase in depth of <b>coal</b> mining, <b>outburst</b> intensity and frequency tend to increase, posing more threats to lives of miners and facilities. Therefore in recent decades, the subject of outbursts has been a focus of interest in major coal-producing countries, particularly in China where some coal mines extract coal seams of greater than 1000  m depth. A number of hypothesis and theoretical models have been proposed to explain the outburst process, such as cavity theory (Briggs 1920), pocket theory (Farmer and Pooley 1967), dynamic theory (Shepherd et al. 1981) and spherical shell destabilization theory (Jiang 1998). However there is still no single theory or hypothesis that can explain the entire outburst process due to the wide variety of conditions under which outbursts occur. Field observations and laboratory studies reveal that the occurrence and development of an outburst is the result of combined effects of stress redistribution, coal gassiness and physical–mechanical properties of coal. It is generally recognized that for an <b>outburst</b> to occur <b>coal</b> must be deformed and failed under an effective stress and gas in coal must be able to desorb rapidly from the coal and eject the failed coal into a mining opening instantaneously (Lama and Bodziony 1998; Li 2001; Cao et al. 2003; Aguado and Nicieza 2007; Yuan et al. 2011; Torano et al. 2012).|$|R
