5|$|Linear {{search is}} a simple search {{algorithm}} that checks every record until it finds the target value. Linear search can be done on a linked list, which allows for faster insertion and deletion than an array. Binary search is faster than linear search for sorted arrays except if the array is short. If the array must first be sorted, that cost must be amortized <b>over</b> <b>any</b> searches. Sorting the array also enables efficient approximate matches and other operations.|$|E

This allows existing connectors that are already found in mobile devices – such as micro-USB – to be utilized, avoiding the need to add additional dedicated video output sockets. The USB port switches to MHL mode when it detects a compatible device is connected.|$|E

All Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL) clubs will participate, with the thirty clubs from the Championship, League One and League Two now joined by Under-20 {{teams from the}} twelve Premiership clubs. Also participating by invitation will be four teams each from the Highland and Lowland Leagues and four entrants from outside Scottish football – two each from the NIFL Premiership in Northern Ireland and the Welsh Premier League in Wales. Teams are seeded to enter the competition <b>over</b> <b>any</b> of the first four rounds, after which eight teams will remain to contest the quarter-finals. The final is played at a neutral venue.|$|E
5|$|Deal Castle was {{increasingly}} resembling a private house, rather than purely a fortification, and {{this led to}} arguments in 1829 {{as to whether it}} should be subject to local taxation as a private dwelling, or continue to be exempt as a military site. The captaincy had long since become an honorary position, given out as a reward by the Crown. In 1898, the War Office agreed that the Office of Works should be consulted <b>over</b> <b>any</b> external alterations to the historic castle, and that the Office of Works would be responsible for paying for any resulting work. The War Office finally concluded in 1904 that the castle no longer had any value either as a defence or as a barracks, and transferred it entirely to the Office of Works. When the captain was not in residence it was opened to visitors.|$|E
5|$|Discussions on {{improving}} the UN's effectiveness and responsiveness to international security threats often include {{reform of the}} UNSC veto. Proposals include: limiting {{the use of the}} veto to vital national security issues; requiring agreement from multiple states before exercising the veto; abolishing the veto entirely; and embarking on the transition stipulated in Article 106 of the Charter, which requires the consensus principle to stay in place. Any reform of the veto will be very difficult. Articles 108 and 109 of the United Nations Charter grant the P5 veto <b>over</b> <b>any</b> amendments to the Charter, requiring them to approve of any modifications to the UNSC veto power that they themselves hold.|$|E

5|$|Government {{meetings}} are public; however, {{the government may}} decide to close any part of its sessions (or entire sessions) to the public. The prime minister may authorise any deputy to represent the PM and otherwise take <b>over</b> <b>any</b> particular task assigned to the PM. The quorum for government sessions is a majority of government members. Most decisions are reached by a simple majority vote; a two-thirds majority vote is required for decisions about changes to the Croatian Constitution, uniting with other states or transferring any part of Croatian sovereignty to supranational organisations, changes to Croatian borders, dissolution of the parliament, or calling a referendum.|$|E
5|$|Low {{back pain}} that lasts {{at least one}} day and limits {{activity}} is a common complaint.

Approximately 9 to 12% of people (632million) have LBP at any given point in time, and nearly one quarter (23.2%) report having it at some point <b>over</b> <b>any</b> one-month period.

Low back pain is more common among people aged 4080years, with the overall number of individuals affected expected to increase as the population ages.|$|E
5|$|Nigel Kneale was a BBC {{employee}} at the time, {{which meant that}} his scripts were owned entirely by the BBC and he received no extra payment {{for the sale of}} the film rights. This became a matter of some resentment on Kneale's part, and when his BBC contract came up for renewal he demanded and secured control <b>over</b> <b>any</b> future film rights for his work. Despite this Kneale remained bitter over the affair until the BBC made an ex-gratia payment of £3,000 to him in 1967, in recognition of his creation of Quatermass.|$|E

5|$|The {{medication}} typically recommended first are NSAIDs (though not aspirin) or {{skeletal muscle}} relaxants {{and these are}} enough for most people. Benefits with NSAIDs; however, is often small. High-quality reviews have found acetaminophen (paracetamol) {{to be no more}} effective than placebo at improving pain, quality of life, or function. NSAIDs are more effective for acute episodes than acetaminophen; however, they carry a greater risk of side effects including: kidney failure, stomach ulcers and possibly heart problems. Thus, NSAIDs are a second choice to acetaminophen, recommended only when the pain is not handled by the latter. NSAIDs are available in several different classes; {{there is no evidence to}} support the use of COX-2 inhibitors <b>over</b> <b>any</b> other class of NSAIDs with respect to benefits. With respect to safety naproxen may be best. Muscle relaxants may be beneficial.|$|E
5|$|The tour also {{prompted}} the eventual {{formation of the}} New Zealand Rugby Football Union (NZRFU, later renamed New Zealand Rugby Union) in 1892; one reason for its formation was to ensure greater control <b>over</b> <b>any</b> future touring New Zealand sides. The NZRFU sent an officially sanctioned New Zealand team, captained by Ellison, to tour Australia in 1893. The Natives are also the forefathers of the Māori All Blacks, a representative team organised by the NZRFU, that first played in 1910. The Native team, along with Joe Warbrick, {{was inducted into the}} IRB Hall of Fame in 2008– the seventh inductee.|$|E
5|$|The various {{agencies}} {{that participated in}} Operation PBHistory had different aims in mind for {{the products of the}} operation. The CIA was most interested in using the information gathered against communist movements in Latin America and elsewhere. The State Department wanted to use them to reconstruct the history of the communist party within Guatemala, while the highest priority of the United States Information Agency was to use the documents to release information {{that could be used to}} change international opinion. The agents in charge of the operation were expected to balance these various interests: however, as the organization behind the operation, the CIA had veto power <b>over</b> <b>any</b> public use. The work done by the PBHistory team assisted two existing CIA operations, Operation Kufire and Operation Kugown, both of which had been a part of Operation PBSUCCESS.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the initial}} search {{failed to find}} any links to the Soviet Union, the CIA decided to extend the operation, and on 4 August a much larger team was deployed, with members from many {{government}} departments, including the State Department and the USIA. The task force was given the cover name Social Research Group. To avoid confrontation with Guatemalan nationalists, the CIA opted to leave the documents in Guatemalan possession, instead funding {{the creation of a}} Guatemalan intelligence agency that would try to dismantle the communist organizations. Thus the National Committee of Defense Against Communism (Comité de Defensa Nacional Contra el Comunismo) was created on 20 July, and granted a great deal of power over military and police functions. The personnel of the new agency were also put to work analyzing the same documents. The document-processing phase of the operation was terminated on 28 September 1954, having examined 500,000 documents. There was tension between the different U.S. government agencies about using the information; the CIA wished to use it to subvert communists, the USIA for propaganda. The CIA's leadership of the operation allowed it to retain control <b>over</b> <b>any</b> documents deemed necessary for clandestine operations. A consequence of PBHISTORY was the opening of a CIA file on Argentine communist Ernesto Che Guevara.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the festival Cosima received a long, critical memorandum from an unknown observer, which highlighted numerous divergences from Wagner's directions. This, says Marek, proved to be a critical factor in determining her future life's mission: the maintenance of Wagner's heritage creations through the preservation of his interpretations. In her seclusion, Cosima learned of an abortive plan masterminded by Julius Kniese, the festival's chorus-master, by which Liszt was to assume the role of music director and Bülow would be chief conductor. Neither Liszt nor Bülow was interested in this arrangement, and the plan died. With Groß's assistance, Cosima pre-empted any further attempts by outsiders to assume control of the Wagner legacy, by obtaining legal recognition of herself and Siegfried as sole heirs to all Wagner's property, physical and intellectual. By this means she secured an unassailable advantage <b>over</b> <b>any</b> other claim on direction of the festival's future.|$|E
5|$|By 1440 he {{was firmly}} in the king's favour, being made in {{succession}} the first ever English viscount as Viscount Beaumont (1440), possibly because by then Boulogne was effectively lost to him and then granted royal lands in East Anglia, further official positions in royal castles, Lord Great Chamberlain, elected to the Garter and the feudal Viscountcy of Beaumont in France. In 1445 he was made premier viscount, and granted precedence <b>over</b> <b>any</b> other- as-yet unmade- viscounts. These consistent promotions and favouritism {{have been the subject}} of some speculation by historians; John Watts has questioned why he 'attracted such an extraordinary heap of honours and perquisites from the crown in these years.' He suggests that as a major noble in East Anglia- with all the territorial and regional significance that meant- was enough to make him worthy of promotion. Beaumont commissioned a contemporary manuscript on chivalry, Knyghthode and Bataile, an adaption of Vegetius for presentation to the king, and was also a major benefactor of Queens' College, Cambridge which the king had granted by charter to his wife Margaret in 1448.|$|E
