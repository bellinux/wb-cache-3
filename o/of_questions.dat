40|$|Abstract: When {{new social}} survey {{questionnaires}} are composed, {{it is helpful}} to create a “summary <b>of</b> <b>question</b> items, ” a table in which similar question items used in past surveys are tabulated. It can take more than one week to manually prepare a summary <b>of</b> <b>question</b> items from three or four surveys. In this research, a support tool that creates a summary <b>of</b> <b>question</b> items accurately and automatically for questionnaires stored in the “SRDQ ” social survey data archive is developed. We have also constructed a man-machine interface system that allows the user to edit the summary <b>of</b> <b>question</b> items created automatically with the proposed method. The system includes a function to help the user locate incorrect items by showing potentially incorrect items in a different color. Through the generation tests <b>of</b> “summary <b>of</b> <b>question</b> items, ” it is confirmed the creation time of a summary <b>of</b> <b>question</b> items {{with the assistance of the}} proposed tool has been reduced to approximately one tenth of the time required to manually create a summary.

This research tries to examine the functions <b>of</b> <b>question</b> in written advertisements. By using a descriptive quantitative research technique, the writer tried to analize the readers interpretations on the functions <b>of</b> <b>question</b> in written advertisements. This analysis is based on The Language Functions proposed by Roman Jakobson and Dell Hymes, which reveals some functions of sentences. The sample <b>of</b> <b>question</b> was taken from four written advertisements in two magazines published in America.

Whatever function selected by the respondents enable them to derive the advertisers’ messages. The similarity and difference in interpreting question in written advertisements might not merely be determined by the educational and occupational backgrounds of the respondents yet these might be influenced by the factors of the individual respondents’ perception and opinions...|$|R

In particular, to model public interest in question recommendation, we build a language model to combine relevance score to the query and popularity score regarding question popularity. Experimental results on Yahoo!Answers dataset demonstrate the performance <b>of</b> <b>question</b> recommendation can be greatly improved with considering the public interest...|$|R
5|$|After time expires, the chaser {{is given}} {{two minutes to}} catch the team by {{correctly}} answering a new series <b>of</b> <b>questions,</b> with each correct answer moving him one space along the board. If the chaser answers incorrectly or passes, the clock is stopped briefly and the team is {{given a chance to}} answer the question, which they may confirm among themselves before answering. A correct answer pushes the chaser back one space, or moves the team ahead by one if he has not moved on to the gameboard. An incorrect answer provides no movement for the chaser at all. Regardless of the outcome, the clock begins running again and the chaser continues to answer questions. If the chaser runs out of time before catching the team, the team splits the banked money equally, but if he catches them before time expires, the team leaves with no money. During celebrity episodes, if the chaser catches the team before time runs out, the team leaves with $15,000 divided equally.|$|E
5|$|As Taylor took office, Congress faced {{a battery}} <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> {{related to the}} Mexican Cession, {{acquired}} by the U.S. after the Mexican War and divided into military districts. It was unclear which districts would be established into states and which would become federal territories, while the question of their slave status threatened to bitterly divide Congress. Additionally, many in the South had grown increasingly angry about the aid that northerners had given to fugitive slaves. While a southern slaveowner himself, Taylor believed that slavery was economically infeasible in the Mexican Cession, and as such he opposed slavery in those territories as a needless source of controversy. His major goal was sectional peace, preserving the Union through legislative compromise. As the threat of Southern secession grew, he sided increasingly with antislavery northerners such as Senator William H. Seward of New York, even suggesting that he would sign the Wilmot Proviso to ban slavery in federal territories should such a bill reach his desk.|$|E

5|$|In a Year 3 {{elementary}} {{classroom in}} South Wales a teacher was having difficulty keeping three girls on task during designated private study times. The teacher reached for aid from behavior analysts, and a delayed gratification behavior modification plan {{was put into}} place. The study gave limits on the amounts <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> the children could ask, {{and if they did}} not exceed the limit, they were given tokens for rewards. The token economy for rewards is an example of delayed gratification, by way of cool processing. Instead of having the girls focus on attention-seeking behaviors that distracted the teacher and the students, the teacher had them focus on how many questions they had, and if they needed to ask for help from the teacher. They also focused on gaining tokens rather than focusing on the final reward, which increased their delays. By giving the children this goal and the promise of positive reinforcement for good behavior, the girls dropped their rate of question-asking and attention-seeking.|$|E

Bass is unsettled by the brutal way that Epps treats his slaves and expresses his opposition to American slavery, earning Epps's enmity. Solomon overhears the conversation and decides to reveal his kidnapping to Bass. Once again, Northup asks for help in getting a letter to Saratoga Springs. Bass, risking his life, agrees to send it. One day, the local sheriff arrives in a carriage with another man. The sheriff asks Northup a series <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> to confirm that his answers match the facts of his life in New York.

Parker has come to free him, and the two embrace, though an enraged Epps furiously protests the circumstances and tries to prevent him from leaving. Solomon gives an emotional farewell to Patsey and rides off to his freedom. Patsey faints as Solomon leaves.|$|E
