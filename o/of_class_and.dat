5|$|Michael Balcon, {{the head}} of Ealing Studios and the {{producer}} of Kind Hearts and Coronets, appointed Robert Hamer as director. Hamer {{was interested in the}} film, and thought it an interesting project with possibilities of using the English language in a unique way in the film. Filming took place from September 1948 at Leeds Castle and other locations in Kent, and at Ealing Studios. The themes <b>of</b> <b>class</b> <b>and</b> sexual repression run through the film, particularly love between classes.|$|E
5|$|The {{foundation}} of the Fourth International was seen as {{more than just the}} simple renaming of an international tendency that was already in existence. It was argued that the Third International had now degenerated completely and was therefore {{to be seen as a}} counter-revolutionary organisation that would in time of crisis defend capitalism. Trotsky believed that the coming World War would produce a revolutionary wave <b>of</b> <b>class</b> <b>and</b> national struggles, rather as World War I had done.|$|E
5|$|North & South is a British {{television}} drama serial, {{produced by}} the BBC and originally broadcast in four episodes on BBC One in November and December 2004. It follows the story of Margaret Hale (Daniela Denby-Ashe), a young woman from southern England who has {{to move to the}} North after her father decides to leave the clergy. The family struggles to adjust itself to the industrial town's customs, especially after meeting the Thorntons, a proud family of cotton mill owners who seem to despise their social inferiors. The story explores the issues <b>of</b> <b>class</b> <b>and</b> gender, as Margaret's sympathy for the town mill workers clashes with her growing attraction to John Thornton (Richard Armitage).|$|E

5|$|The second {{approach}} {{to the problem of}} sets belonging to themselves took as its base the notion <b>of</b> <b>class,</b> <b>and</b> defines a set as a class which belongs to other classes, while a proper class is defined as a class which does not belong to other classes. Under the Zermelo–Fraenkel approach, the axioms impede the construction of a set of all sets which do not belong to themselves. In contrast, under the von Neumann approach, the class of all sets which do not belong to themselves can be constructed, but it is a proper class and not a set.|$|E

25|$|Before the Revolution, Baptist and Methodist evangelicals in the South had {{promoted}} {{the view of}} the common man's equality before God, which embraced slaves and free blacks.

25|$|When classes {{focus on}} complex {{issues such as}} racial discrimination, {{economic}} injustices, and inequities <b>of</b> <b>class</b> <b>and</b> gender, they should be taught by qualified faculty who have the depth of information and historical competence that such critical social issues warrant. Our society's deep and tangled cultural conflicts can neither be explained nor resolved by simplistic ideological formulas.|$|E

The balance between American nationalism and cosmopolitanism is idealized in the novel through the character of the Marquis de Lafayette, as is the struggle between Old World notions <b>of</b> <b>class</b> <b>and</b> the reality of American democracy.|$|E

25|$|Cremor {{was born}} at Sandringham in Melbourne to railway porter William Edward Cremor and Jane, née Phelan. His early {{education}} took place at Footscray State School up to 1911 when he began at St. Joseph's CBC North Melbourne, later St. Joseph's College Melbourne. During his first year there he achieved Dux <b>of</b> <b>class</b> <b>and</b> in subsequent years earned distinctions in Algebra, French and History. Early in 1914 he completed his examination to become a clerk in the Victorian Public Service and in 1915 {{was transferred to the}} Commonwealth Department of Trade and Customs.|$|E
25|$|In his After the Fact (1995) study, the {{anthropologist}} Clifford Geertz documented {{changes in a}} city in Morocco. As poor rural migrants moved into the center city during urbanization, the older, more established and wealthier populations moved to the outskirts. This pattern <b>of</b> <b>class</b> <b>and</b> education succession has been seen in United States cities, where poor immigrants and migrants have occupied older areas of affordable housing, but when economically established, they move to better areas, often in the suburbs. In recent decades, such ethnic succession seen first in center cities has been {{taking place in the}} suburbs, too.|$|E
25|$|In the Bouchet & Rocroi {{taxonomy}}, clades {{are used}} between the rank <b>of</b> <b>class</b> <b>and</b> {{the rank of}} superfamily. The clades are unranked. Bouchet and Rocroi use six main clades: Patellogastropoda, Vetigastropoda, Cocculiniformia, Neritimorpha, Caenogastropoda, and Heterobranchia. The first three of these major clades have no nesting clades within them: the taxonomy goes immediately to the superfamily level. Within the Caenogastropoda there is one extra clade. In contrast, within the Heterobranchia, {{for some of the}} nudibranch groups there are six separate clades above the level of superfamily, {{and in the case of}} most of the land snails, there are four clades above the level of superfamily.|$|E

25|$|The {{accident}} {{is frequently}} {{described as having}} released more radioactivity than the Three Mile Island accident that occurred four months earlier and was the largest release of radioactive material in U.S. history. The spill contaminated groundwater and rendered the Puerco unusable by local residents. The governor of New Mexico refused the Navajo Nation's request that the site be declared a federal disaster area, limiting aid to affected residents. The event received less media coverage than that of Three Mile Island, likely because it occurred in a lightly populated, rural area. Some scholars suggest there were elements <b>of</b> <b>class</b> <b>and</b> racism to the neglect as well, since it affected primarily poor Native Americans.|$|E
25|$|The Robbers (Die Räuber): The {{language}} of The Robbers is highly emotional, and {{the depiction of}} physical violence in the play marks it as a quintessential work of Germany's Romantic Sturm und Drang movement. The Robbers is considered by critics like Peter Brooks {{to be the first}} European melodrama. The play pits two brothers against each other in alternating scenes, as one quests for money and power, while the other attempts to create revolutionary anarchy in the Bohemian Forest. The play strongly criticises the hypocrisies <b>of</b> <b>class</b> <b>and</b> religion, and the economic inequities of German society; it also conducts a complicated inquiry into the nature of evil. Schiller was inspired by the play Julius of Tarent by Johann Anton Leisewitz.|$|E
25|$|In theory, {{the early}} Dharma-sutras and Dharma-sastras, such as Paraskara Grhyasutra, Gautama Smriti and Yajnavalkya smriti, state all four varnas are {{eligible}} to all fields of knowledge; while verses of Manusmriti state that Vedic study is available only to men of three varnas, unavailable to Shudra and women. In practice, state Stella Kramrisch and others, the guru tradition and availability of education extended to all segments of ancient and medieval society. Lise McKean states the guru concept has been prevalent over the range <b>of</b> <b>class</b> <b>and</b> caste backgrounds, and the disciples a guru attracts come from both genders {{and a range of}} classes and castes. During the bhakti movement of Hinduism, which started in about mid 1st millennium CE, the gurus included women and members of all varna.|$|E

25|$|Slave-ownership was {{the primary}} marker <b>of</b> <b>class</b> <b>and</b> even the town's freedmen and other people of color {{typically}} kept slaves {{if they had the}} wealth to do so. Visitors commonly remarked on the sheer number of blacks in Charleston and their seeming freedom of movement, though in fact—mindful of the Stono Rebellion and the violent slave revolution that established Haiti—the whites closely regulated the behavior of both slaves and free people of color. Wages and hiring practices were fixed, identifying badges were sometimes required, and even work songs were sometimes censored. Punishment was handled out of sight by the city's Work House, whose fees netting the municipal government thousands a year. In 1820, a state law mandated that each individual act of freeing a slave henceforth legislative approval, effectively halting the practice.|$|E
25|$|While at Harvard Kittredge {{also joined}} several clubs and societies, wrote light verse, and won {{numerous}} consecutive Bowdoin prizes for his essays and translations, including one from English into Attic Greek. He {{also became a}} member of the editorial board of the Harvard Advocate. In 1881 Kittredge was the prompter and pronunciation coach in a celebrated theatrical performance by undergraduates of Sophocles's Oedipus Rex in the original Greek that was attended by Ralph Waldo Emerson, Julia Ward Howe, William Dean Howells, Charles Eliot Norton, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and classicist B. L. Gildersleeve of Johns Hopkins University among other luminaries. As an undergraduate, Kittredge also read widely outside <b>of</b> <b>class,</b> <b>and</b> became known as a witty after dinner speaker. In 1882, he was elected Ivy Orator (chosen to deliver a humorous speech) of his graduating class. Graduating with Kittredge that year was Owen Wister, author of the first Western novel, The Virginian.|$|E
25|$|Fascists {{promoted}} {{social welfare}} to ameliorate economic conditions affecting their nation or {{race as a}} whole, {{but they did not}} support social welfare for egalitarian reasons towards those not considered racially embodied with pure German blood. Under an extensive welfare system, over 17 million Germans obtain assistance under the control of National Socialist People's Welfare (NSV) by 1939, an agency that had “projected a powerful image of caring and support”. The NSV had grown to the second largest Nazi group organization by 1939, dwarfed only by the German Labor Front. The NSV and its Winter Aid and Strength Through Joy provided evidence to the German citizenry that the National Socialists were keeping their promise to create “an organic national community” where “class conflict and social antagonisms would be overcome” and the “egoism of the individual” would instead surrender to the “overriding interests of the whole”. These programs were designed to “obliterate distinctions <b>of</b> <b>class</b> <b>and</b> status” and enhance the lives of the ordinary people. Fascists criticized egalitarianism as preserving the weak and they instead promoted social Darwinist views.|$|E
