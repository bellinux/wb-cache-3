5|$|Amazonian period (named after Amazonis Planitia): between 3.3 and 2.9 {{billion years}} ago to the present. Amazonian regions have few {{meteorite}} impact craters, but are otherwise quite varied. <b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> formed during this period, with lava flows elsewhere on Mars.|$|E
5|$|Mars (1.5AU {{from the}} Sun) {{is smaller than}} Earth and Venus (0.107 Earth masses). It has an {{atmosphere}} of mostly carbon dioxide with a surface pressure of 6.1 millibars (roughly 0.6% of that of Earth). Its surface, peppered with vast volcanoes, such as <b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons,</b> and rift valleys, such as Valles Marineris, shows geological activity that may have persisted until as recently as 2 million years ago. Its red colour comes from iron oxide (rust) in its soil. Mars has two tiny natural satellites (Deimos and Phobos) thought to be captured asteroids.|$|E
5|$|The {{rotational}} {{period and}} seasonal cycles of Mars are likewise {{similar to those}} of Earth, as is the tilt that produces the seasons. Mars is the site of <b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons,</b> the largest volcano and second-highest known mountain in the Solar System, and of Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System. The smooth Borealis basin in the northern hemisphere covers 40% of the planet and may be a giant impact feature. Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped. These may be captured asteroids, similar to 5261 Eureka, a Mars trojan.|$|E
5|$|For {{the scene}} of the Prometheus descent to the alien moon LV-223, visual effects art {{director}} Steven Messing referenced NASA imagery, including vortex cloud structures. He also used aerial photographs of locations in Iceland and Wadi Rum shot by VFX supervisor Richard Stammers and his team. Messing painted over these images and combined them with 3D set extensions to create a realistic altered landscape. Scott wanted the ship's descent scenes {{to have a sense of}} grandeur to contrast the dark and shrouded descent featured in Alien. Much of LV-223s world was based upon the world visited in Alien, but scaled back as Scott felt some elements were too unrealistic. Other influences were the Martian mountain <b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> and several large mountain structures on Earth. NASA advisers provided concepts for the aesthetics of alien worlds which were incorporated into the design work. MPC developed a digital representation of Wadi Rum using the design material, modified it to locate the alien pyramid and a landing area for the Prometheus, and resized the planet's natural features relative to the alien structures.|$|E
25|$|<b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> is an {{unlikely}} landing location for automated space probes {{in the near}} future. The high elevations preclude parachute-assisted landings because of insufficient atmospheric thickness to slow the spacecraft down. Moreover, <b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> stands {{in one of the}} dustiest regions of Mars. A mantle of fine dust covers much of the terrain, obscuring the underlying bedrock and possibly making rock samples hard to come by. The dust layer would also likely cause severe maneuvering problems for rovers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> lies at {{the edge}} of the Tharsis bulge, a vast {{volcanic}} plateau that is very ancient. The formation of Tharsis was likely complete by the end of the Noachian Period. At the time <b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> began to form in Hesperian times, the volcano was located on a shallow slope that descended from the high in Tharsis into the northern lowland basins. Over time, these basins would have received large volumes of sediment eroded from Tharsis and the southern highlands. The sediments likely contained abundant Noachian-aged phyllosilicates (clays) formed during an early period on Mars when surface water was abundant. The sediments would be thickest in the northwest where basin depth was greatest. As the volcano grew through lateral spreading, low-friction detachment zones preferentially developed in the thicker sediment layers to the northwest, creating the basal escarpment and widespread lobes of aureole material (Lycus Sulci). Spreading also occurred to the southeast; however, it was more constrained in that direction by the Tharsis rise, which presented a higher-friction zone at the volcano's base. Friction was higher in that direction because the sediments were thinner and probably consisted of coarser grained material resistant to sliding. The competent and rugged basement rocks of Tharsis acted as an additional source of friction. Thus, basal spreading of <b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> was inhibited in the southeast direction, accounting for the structural and topographic asymmetry of the mountain. Numerical models of particle dynamics involving lateral differences in friction along the base of <b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> have been shown to reproduce the volcano's present shape and asymmetry fairly well.|$|E
25|$|Amazonian epoch (named after Amazonis Planitia): 1.8 {{billion years}} ago to present. Amazonian regions have few {{meteorite}} impact craters but are otherwise quite varied. <b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons,</b> the largest volcano in the known Universe, formed during this period along with lava flows elsewhere on Mars.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} extinct volcanoes on Mars, four {{of which are}} vast shield volcanoes far bigger than any on Earth. They include Arsia Mons, Ascraeus Mons, Hecates Tholus, <b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons,</b> and Pavonis Mons. These volcanoes have been extinct for many {{millions}} of years, but the European Mars Express spacecraft has found evidence that volcanic activity may have occurred on Mars {{in the recent past}} as well.|$|E
25|$|Even so, high-altitude {{orographic}} clouds frequently drift {{over the}} <b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> summit, and airborne Martian dust is still present. Although the average Martian surface atmospheric pressure {{is less than}} one percent of Earth's, the much lower gravity on Mars increases the atmosphere's scale height; in other words, Mars's atmosphere is expansive and does not drop off in density with height as sharply as Earth's.|$|E
25|$|Clouds {{surrounding}} mountains {{display a}} seasonal variability. Clouds at <b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> and Ascreaus Mons appear in northern hemisphere spring and summer, reaching a total maximum area of approximately 900,000km2 and 1,000,000km2 respectively in late spring. Clouds around Alba Patera and Pavonis Mons show an additional, smaller peak in late summer. Very few clouds {{were observed in}} winter. Predictions from the Mars General Circulation Model are consistent with these observations.|$|E
25|$|When the Mariner 9 probe {{arrived at}} Mars in 1971, the world {{expected}} to see crisp new pictures of surface detail. Instead they saw a near planet-wide dust storm with only the giant volcano <b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> showing above the haze. The storm lasted for a month, an occurrence scientists have since learned is quite common on Mars. Using data from Mariner 9, James B. Pollack et al. proposed a mechanism for Mars dust storms in 1973.|$|E
25|$|The {{flanks of}} <b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> {{are made up}} of innumerable lava flows and lava channels. Many of the flows have levees along their margins (pictured). Levees are {{parallel}} ridges formed at the edges of lava flows. The cooler, outer margins of the flow solidify, leaving a central trough of molten, flowing lava. Partially collapsed lava tubes are visible as chains of pit craters, and broad lava fans formed by lava emerging from intact, subsurface tubes are also common. In places along the volcano's base, lava flows can be seen spilling out into the surrounding plains, forming broad aprons, and burying the basal escarpment. (Note: Lava flows refer to both actively flowing lava and the solidified landforms they produce. The meaning here is the latter, since Mars has no active lava flows at the present time.) Crater counts from high-resolution images taken by the Mars Express orbiter in 2004 indicate that lava flows on the northwestern flank of <b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> range in age from 115 million years old (Mya) to only 2 Mya. These ages are very recent in geological terms, suggesting that the mountain may still be volcanically active, though in a very quiescent and episodic fashion.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the size}} of <b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> and its shallow slopes, an {{observer}} standing on the Martian surface would be unable to view the entire profile of the volcano, even from a great distance. The curvature of the planet and the volcano itself would obscure such a synoptic view. Similarly, an observer near the summit would be unaware of standing on a very high mountain, as the slope of the volcano would extend far beyond the horizon, a mere 3 kilometers away.|$|E
25|$|The Mariner 9 {{spacecraft}} {{arrived in}} orbit around Mars in 1971 during a global dust-storm. The first objects to become visible as the dust began to settle, {{the tops of the}} Tharsis volcanoes, demonstrated that the altitude of these features greatly exceeded that of any mountain found on Earth, as astronomers expected. Observations of the planet from Mariner 9 confirmed that Nix Olympica was not just a mountain, but a volcano. Ultimately, astronomers adopted the name <b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> for the albedo feature known as Nix Olympica.|$|E
25|$|<b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> is {{asymmetrical}} structurally {{as well as}} topographically. The longer, more shallow northwestern flank displays extensional features, such {{as large}} slumps and normal faults. In contrast, the volcano's steeper southeastern side has features indicating compression. They include step-like terraces in the volcano's mid-flank region (interpreted as thrust faults) {{and a number of}} wrinkle ridges located at the basal escarpment. Why opposite sides of the mountain should show different styles of deformation is puzzling. The answer may lie in understanding how large shield volcanoes grow laterally and on how variations within the substrate of the volcano affect the final shape of the mountain.|$|E
25|$|The {{extraordinary}} size of <b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> {{is likely}} because Mars lacks mobile tectonic plates. Unlike on Earth, the crust of Mars remains fixed over a stationary hotspot, and a volcano {{can continue to}} discharge lava until it reaches an enormous height. Like the basalt volcanoes on Earth, Martian basaltic volcanoes are capable of erupting enormous quantities of ash. The basalt found on Earth and Mars are very similar in composition. Due to the gravity on Mars, there are less buoyant forces on the magma {{rising out of the}} crust. Also, the magma chambers are thought to be much larger and deeper than the ones found on Earth.|$|E
25|$|Olympian Gods: former post-humans {{who were}} {{transformed}} into gods by Prospero's technology. They {{do not remember}} the science behind their technology, save for Zeus and Hephaestus, and they are described both as preliterate and post-literate, for which reason they enlist the services of Thomas Hockenberry and other scholics. They dwell on <b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> on Mars and use quantum teleportation {{in order to get}} to the recreation of Troy on an alternate Earth. Though the events of the Trojan War are being recreated with the knowledge of Homer's Iliad, the only ones who know its outcome are the scholics and Zeus as Zeus has forbade the other gods from knowing.|$|E
25|$|Large shield volcanoes grow {{not only}} by adding {{material}} to their flanks as erupted lava, but also by spreading laterally at their bases. As a volcano grows in size, the stress field underneath the volcano changes from compressional to extensional. A subterranean rift may develop {{at the base of}} the volcano, causing the underlying crust to spread apart. If the volcano rests on sediments containing mechanically weak layers (e.g., beds of water-saturated clay), detachment zones (decollements) may develop in the weak layers. The extensional stresses in the detachment zones can produce giant landslides and normal faults on the volcano's flanks, leading to the formation of a basal escarpment. Further from the volcano, these detachment zones can express themselves as a succession of overlapping, gravity driven thrust faults. This mechanism has long been cited as an explanation of the <b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> aureole deposits (discussed below).|$|E
500|$|The {{shield volcano}} <b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> (Mount Olympus) is an extinct volcano {{in the vast}} upland region Tharsis, which {{contains}} several other large volcanoes. <b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> is roughly three times the height of Mount Everest, which in comparison stands at just over [...] It is either the tallest or second-tallest mountain in the Solar System, depending on how it is measured, with various sources giving figures ranging from about [...] high.|$|E
500|$|Large albedo {{features}} retain many of {{the older}} names, but are often updated to reflect new knowledge {{of the nature of}} the features. For example, Nix Olympica (the snows of Olympus) has become <b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> (Mount Olympus). The surface of Mars as seen from Earth is divided into two kinds of areas, with differing albedo. The paler plains covered with dust and sand rich in reddish iron oxides were once thought of as Martian [...] "continents" [...] and given names like Arabia Terra (land of Arabia) or Amazonis Planitia (Amazonian plain). The dark features were thought to be seas, hence their names Mare Erythraeum, Mare Sirenum and Aurorae Sinus. The largest dark feature seen from Earth is Syrtis Major Planum. The permanent northern polar ice cap is named Planum Boreum, whereas the southern cap is called Planum Australe.|$|E
500|$|Mars {{lost its}} {{magnetosphere}} 4 billion years ago, possibly because of numerous asteroid strikes, so {{the solar wind}} interacts directly with the Martian ionosphere, lowering the atmospheric density by stripping away atoms from the outer layer. Both Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Express have detected ionised atmospheric particles trailing off into space behind Mars, and this atmospheric loss is being studied by the MAVEN orbiter. Compared to Earth, the atmosphere of Mars is quite rarefied. Atmospheric pressure on the surface today ranges {{from a low of}} [...] on <b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> to over [...] in Hellas Planitia, with a mean pressure at the surface level of [...] The highest atmospheric density on Mars is equal to that found [...] above Earth's surface. The resulting mean surface pressure is only 0.6% of that of Earth (101.3 kPa). The scale height of the atmosphere is about , which is higher than Earth's, , because the surface gravity of Mars is only about 38% of Earth's, an effect offset by both the lower temperature and 50% higher average molecular weight of the atmosphere of Mars.|$|E
500|$|Intra-patera eruptions {{occur within}} {{volcanic}} depressions known as paterae, which generally have flat floors bounded by steep walls. Paterae resemble terrestrial calderas, {{but it is}} unknown whether they form when an empty lava chamber collapses, like their terrestrial cousins. One hypothesis suggests that they are produced through the exhumation of volcanic sills, with the overlying material either being blasted out or integrated into the sill. Some paterae display evidence for multiple collapses, similar to the calderas atop <b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> on Mars or Kīlauea on Earth, suggesting that they may occasionally form like volcanic calderas. Because the formation mechanism is still uncertain, the general term for these features uses the Latin descriptor term employed by the International Astronomical Union in naming them, paterae. Unlike similar features on Earth and Mars, these depressions generally do not lie {{at the peak of}} shield volcanoes and are larger, with an average diameter of [...] [...] Patera depths have been measured for only a few paterae and typically exceed 1km. The largest volcanic depression on Io is Loki Patera at [...] across. Whatever the formation mechanism, the morphology and distribution of many paterae suggest that they are structurally controlled, with at least half bounded by faults or mountains.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> is {{partially}} {{surrounded by a}} region of distinctive grooved or corrugated terrain known as the <b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> aureole. The aureole consists of several large lobes. Northwest of the volcano, the aureole extends a distance of up to [...] and is known as Lycus Sulci (...) [...] East of <b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons,</b> the aureole {{is partially}} covered by lava flows, but where it is exposed it goes by different names (Gigas Sulci, for example). The origin of the aureole remains debated, but it was likely formed by huge landslides [...] or gravity-driven thrust sheets that sloughed off {{the edges of the}} <b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> shield.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> ( [...] ; Latin for Mount Olympus) is a {{very large}} shield volcano on the planet Mars. By one measure, it has a height of nearly 22km (13.6mi or 72,000ft). [...] <b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> {{is located}} between the northwestern {{edge of the}} Tharsis region and {{the eastern edge of}} Amazonis Planitia. It stands about [...] from the other three large Martian shield volcanoes, collectively called the Tharsis Montes (Arsia Mons, Pavonis Mons, and Ascraeus Mons). The Tharsis Montes are {{slightly}} smaller than <b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The typical {{atmospheric}} pressure {{at the top}} of <b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> is 72 pascals, about 12% of the average Martian surface pressure of 600 pascals. Both are exceedingly low by terrestrial standards. By comparison, the {{atmospheric pressure}} at the summit of Mount Everest is 32,000 pascals, or about 32% of Earth's sea level pressure. [...] <b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> shows that there is a composition of 44% silicates, 17.5% iron oxides, giving the planet its red coloration, 7% aluminum, 6% magnesium, 6% calcium, and particularly high proportions of sulfur oxide with 7%. These results point {{to the fact that the}} surface is largely composed of basalts and other mafic rocks, which would have erupted as low viscosity lava flows and hence lead to the low gradients on the surface of the planet. After plate tectonics ceased on Mars, hotspots, which cause volcanoes such as these, remained under the same areas for a very long time, and the volcanoes kept growing. <b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> is supported by a [...] thick lithosphere.|$|E
2500|$|Being {{a shield}} volcano, <b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> {{has a very}} gently sloping profile. The average slope on the volcano's flanks is only 5°. Slopes are highest near the middle part of the flanks and grow {{shallower}} toward the base, giving the flanks a concave upward profile. The shape of <b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> is distinctly asymmetrical. Its flanks are shallower and extend farther from the summit in the northwestern direction than they do to the southeast. The volcano's shape and profile have been likened to a [...] "circus tent" [...] held up by a single pole that is shifted off center.|$|E
2500|$|Martian storms are {{significantly}} affected by Mars' large mountain ranges. Individual mountains like record holding <b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> (...) can affect local weather but larger weather effects {{are due to}} the larger collection of volcanoes in the Tharsis region.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> [...] is {{the result}} of many {{thousands}} of highly fluid, basaltic lava flows that poured from volcanic vents {{over a long period of}} time. (The Hawaiian Islands exemplify [...] similar shield volcanoes on a smaller scale – see Mauna Kea.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Two impact craters on <b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> {{have been}} {{assigned}} provisional names by the International Astronomical Union. They are the -diameter Karzok crater (...) and the -diameter Pangboche crater (...) [...] The craters are notable for being two of several suspected source areas for shergottites, the most abundant class of Martian meteorites.|$|E
2500|$|A wide, annular {{depression}} or moat about [...] deep surrounds {{the base of}} <b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> and {{is thought to be}} due to the volcano's immense weight pressing down on the Martian crust. The depth of this depression is greater on the northwest side of the mountain than on the southeast side.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a shield}} volcano, <b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> resembles {{the shape of}} the large volcanoes making up the Hawaiian Islands. The edifice is about [...] wide. Because the {{mountain}} is so large, with complex structure at its edges, allocating a height to the structure is difficult. It stands [...] above the Mars global datum, and its local relief, from the foot of the cliffs which form its margin to the northwest to its peak, is nearly [...] (a little over twice the height of Mauna Kea as measured from its base on the ocean floor). The total elevation change from the plains of Amazonis Planitia, over [...] to the northwest, to the summit approaches [...] The summit of the mountain has six nested calderas (collapse craters) forming an irregular depression [...] × [...] across and up to [...] deep. The volcano's outer edge consists of an escarpment, or cliff, up to [...] tall (although obscured by lava flows in places), a feature unique among the shield volcanoes of Mars. <b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> covers an area approximately the size of Italy, or about [...]|$|E
2500|$|The {{difference}} between Mars' highest and lowest points is nearly 30km (from {{the top of}} <b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> {{at an altitude of}} 21.2km {{to the bottom of the}} Hellas impact basin at an altitude of 8.2km below the datum). In comparison, the {{difference between}} Earth's highest and lowest points (Mount Everest and the Mariana Trench) is only 19.7km. Combined with the planets' different radii, this means Mars is nearly three times [...] "rougher" [...] than Earth.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> and a {{few other}} volcanoes in the Tharsis region stand high enough to reach above the {{frequent}} Martian dust-storms recorded by telescopic observers as early as the 19th century. The astronomer Patrick Moore pointed out that Schiaparelli (1835–1910) [...] "had found that his Nodus Gordis and Olympic Snow [...] were almost the only features to be seen" [...] during dust storms, and [...] "guessed correctly that they must be high".|$|E
2500|$|Today, {{names of}} Martian {{features}} derive {{from a number}} of sources, but the names of the large features are derived primarily from the maps of Mars made in 1886 by the Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli. Schiaparelli named the larger features of Mars primarily using names from Greek mythology {{and to a lesser extent}} the Bible. [...] Mars Large albedo features retain many of the older names, but are often updated to reflect new knowledge of the nature of the features. For example, 'Nix Olympica' (the snows of Olympus) has become <b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> (Mount Olympus).|$|E
2500|$|The shield volcano, <b>Olympus</b> <b>Mons</b> (Mount Olympus), rises 22km {{above the}} {{surrounding}} volcanic plains, {{and is the}} highest known mountain on any planet in the solar system. It is in a vast upland region called Tharsis, which contains several large volcanos. See list of mountains on Mars. [...] The Tharsis region of Mars also has the solar system's largest canyon system, Valles Marineris or the Mariner Valley, which is 4,000km long and 7km deep. [...] Mars is also scarred by countless impact craters. The largest {{of these is the}} Hellas impact basin. See list of craters on Mars.|$|E
