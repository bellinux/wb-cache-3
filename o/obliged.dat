60|$|He pitied himself profoundly. It was {{a rotten}} world to live in, this, where a fellow couldn't say noblesse <b>oblige</b> without {{upsetting}} the universe. Why shouldn't a fellow say noblesse <b>oblige?</b> Why--? At this juncture Lord Dawlish {{walked into a}} lamp-post.|$|R
60|$|The shock {{changed his}} mood. Gloom still obsessed him, but blended now with remorse. He {{began to look}} at the matter from Claire's viewpoint, and his pity {{switched}} from himself to her. In the first place, the poor girl had rather a rotten time. Could she be blamed for wanting him to make money? No. Yet whenever she made suggestions as to how the thing was to be done, he snubbed her by saying noblesse <b>oblige.</b> Naturally a refined and sensitive young girl objected to having things like noblesse <b>oblige</b> said to her. Where was the sense in saying noblesse <b>oblige?</b> Such a confoundedly silly thing to say. Only a perfect ass would spend his time rushing about the place saying noblesse <b>oblige</b> to people.|$|R

60|$|My wish {{has been}} and is to avail the {{government}} of the services of both General Hunter and General Lane, and, so far as possible, to personally <b>oblige</b> both.

If they cannot come to an amicable understanding, General Lane must report to General Hunter for duty, according to the rules, or decline the service.|$|R
