5|$|Throughout the 1990s, Opel {{had also}} {{been the source of}} many Holden models. To {{increase}} profitability, Holden looked to the South Korean Daewoo brand for replacements after acquiring a 44.6percent stake—worth US$251million—in the company in 2002 as a representative <b>of</b> <b>GM.</b> This was increased to 50.9percent in 2005, but when GM further increased its stake to 70.1percent around the time of its 2009 Chapter 11 reorganisation, Holden's interest was relinquished and transferred to another (undisclosed) part <b>of</b> <b>GM.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{team would}} name Mel Bridgman as their first general manager (GM) in 1991 after being {{turned down by}} Scotty Bowman and John Muckler. The {{decision}} was criticized by the press due to Bridgman's lack <b>of</b> <b>GM</b> experience. In the coaching department, the club would pick Rick Bowness, formerly the Boston Bruins' head coach, as their first head coach, assisted by Alain Vigneault, E. J. Maguire and Chico Resch.

5|$|In a {{major change}} from 2001—when one unnamed former NBA {{executive}} stated that a franchise would not return to Vancouver in his lifetime—Stern revealed in February 2011 that Vancouver was being considered along with Pittsburgh, Tampa and Kansas City. Reasons for considering Vancouver are the strengthening of the Canadian dollar, which for several years in the early 2010s was roughly at par with the U.S. dollar; the influx of international players who would {{be more willing to}} play in Canada; sell-outs for pre-season exhibition games at Rogers Arena (the new name <b>of</b> <b>GM</b> Place); Vancouver having a state-of-the-art venue; and an increased realization among NBA executives that the Vancouver failure was not predominantly because of lack of interest for basketball in Vancouver. The city has also been through a resurrection in professional sports, with the creation of the Vancouver Giants in junior hockey, the 2010 Winter Olympics, and Vancouver Whitecaps FC joining Major League Soccer. However, the location of the city also allows for more varied sports experiences, such as skiing, hunting, fishing and golf, which could partially limit the interest for spectator sports. In addition, the Canadian dollar dramatically weakened against its U.S. counterpart later in the decade, dropping as low as 68 U.S. cents during 2016. NHL commissioner Gary Bettman cited this as a major reason why the league deferred Quebec City's bid to rejoin the NHL.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{document}} {{in detail the}} developmental course of qualitative aspects of early spontaneous motility in intrauterine growth-retarded infants, sequential videotape recordings were made in 19 preterm infants with a birth weight below the 5 th percentile. The quality <b>of</b> general movements (<b>GMs)</b> was studied longitudinally during the preterm and postterm period until approximately 20 weeks corrected age, using Prechtl's method of quality assessment. An abnormal quality <b>of</b> <b>GMs</b> was present in 15 out of 19 infants. Compared to a low-risk group, consisting of appropriate-for-gestational age preterm infants, the proportion of infants with normal findings on brain scans who had an abnormal quality <b>of</b> <b>GMs</b> was high. The presence <b>of</b> 'abrupt chaotic' <b>GMs</b> was related to late fetal heart-rate decelerations and ischaemic alterations of the placenta. The quality <b>of</b> <b>GMs</b> normalized before or during the third month postterm in most infants with abnormal GMs. In four infants, the GMs did not normalize during the study period. The quality of fidgety movements was, in particular, a marker for neurological outcome at 24 months. This study demonstrates that intrauterine growth retardation may cause prolonged, {{but in most cases}} transient brain dysfunction; the qualitative assessment <b>of</b> <b>GMs</b> may help to identify infants at increased risk for neurodevelopmental abnormalities.

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed to {{characterize}} the microstructure and the performance <b>of</b> gelatin microspheres (<b>GMs)</b> cross-linked by two different cross-linkers viz. d-glucose and glutaraldehyde. New formulations were obtained, suspending the GMs in a thermoreversible Pluronic F 127 (PF 127) liquid-crystalline gel. Lysozyme {{was used as a}} model biomacromolecular drug to evaluate release features. Both types <b>of</b> cross-linked <b>GMs</b> were prepared by thermal gelation method. The lysozyme-loaded microspheres were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for size distribution, shape, and surface texture. SEM revealed that both types <b>of</b> lysozyme-loaded <b>GMs</b> were spherical in shape and that the surface <b>of</b> glutaraldehyde cross-linked <b>GMs</b> was smoother than that of the glucose cross-linked <b>GMs.</b> The degree <b>of</b> cross-linking of microspheres was investigated using ATR-FTIR technique. The prepared GMs were suspended in 20 % w/v aqueous PF 127 gel for which the usual sol-gel transition temperature of 22 °C did not change in the presence <b>of</b> <b>GMs,</b> as indicated by rheological measurements. SAXS study of the PF 127 gel confirmed the occurrence of a discrete cubic liquid-crystalline phase of the Fm 3 m type whose lattice parameter slightly decreased as a result <b>of</b> <b>GMs</b> addition. The in vitro release of lysozyme from both types <b>of</b> cross-linked <b>GMs</b> was successfully controlled when they were suspended in PF 127 gel, thus suggesting the potential use of this new combined formulation as a drug-depot system...|$|R
