5|$|Few {{tasks were}} left to {{complete}} when the 1977 construction season began. Most of the pump stations had been turned over to <b>operating</b> <b>personnel</b> by construction workers, and environmental mitigation and cleanup {{was in full swing}} as Alyeska repaired tundra damage caused by construction. Associated-Green, which had performed its construction tasks well, was assigned the job of finishing the final touches on the main pipeline. The last 160 miles of hydrostatic testing were done, 33 remedial welds were completed, and 45 miles of pipe were insulated, among other tasks. Because the pace of construction was much slower than in 1976, fewer workers were needed. Fewer than 11,000 were employed at the peak of 1977 work, about half of 1976's total. On May 31, the final pipeline weld took place.|$|E
5|$|For {{security}} reasons, Groves wanted H. K. Ferguson {{to operate}} the new plant, {{but it was a}} closed shop, and security regulations at the Clinton Engineer Works did not allow trade unions. To get around this, H. K. Ferguson created a wholly owned subsidiary, the Fercleve Corporation (from Ferguson of Cleveland), and the Manhattan District contracted it {{to operate the}} plant for $11,000 a month. <b>Operating</b> <b>personnel</b> for the new plant were initially trained at the Philadelphia pilot plant. In August 1944, Groves, Conant and Fox asked ten enlisted men of the Special Engineer Detachment (SED) at Oak Ridge for volunteers, warning that the job would be dangerous. All ten volunteered. Along with four Fercleve employees, they were sent to Philadelphia to learn about the plant's operation.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Operating</b> room <b>personnel</b> are at {{high risk}} of needlestick {{injuries}} (NSIs) and exposure to blood and body fluids. Objective: To investigate the predictors of NSIs preventive behaviors during surgery among <b>operating</b> room <b>personnel</b> based on a health belief model (HBM). Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 128 <b>operating</b> room <b>personnel</b> in Hamadan, western Iran. Participants were selected, by census sampling, from teaching hospitals, completed a self-reported questionnaire including demographic characteristics, knowledge and HBM constructs. Results: The levels of knowledge and perceived self-efficacy for the NSIs preventive behaviors among <b>operating</b> room <b>personnel</b> were not satisfactory. However, the levels of perceived benefits, susceptibility and severity were reported to be relatively good. The results showed that the perceived susceptibility (β ‑ 0. 627) and cues to action (β 0. 695) were the most important predictors of the NSIs preventive behaviors. Conclusion: The framework of the HBM is useful to predict the NSIs preventive behaviors among <b>operating</b> room <b>personnel...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background: <b>Operating</b> room <b>personnel</b> {{are subject}} to {{occupational}} hazards {{which could lead to}} an increase in free radicals and develop various diseases. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the effect of consuming green tea on the improvement of the blood oxidative biomarkers in <b>operating</b> room <b>personnel</b> who are exposed to anesthetic gases. Materials and Methods: This study was a before-after clinical trial which was conducted on 24 <b>operating</b> room <b>personnel.</b> They were invited to consume 4 cups of a green tea beverage, prepared from 3 g of green tea leaves in 300 mL of boiled water (at 80 ˚ C), daily for 8 weeks. Then, Myeloperoxidase (MPO), DNA damage, Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx), and Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) in the plasma were measured in order to evaluate the level of oxidative stress biomarkers before and after consuming green tea. Results: Green tea consumption by <b>operating</b> room <b>personnel</b> brought about a significant increase in glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase and a considerable decrease in myeloperoxidase and DNA damage. Conclusion: According to the results of this study, green tea consumption as an antioxidant supplement by <b>operating</b> room <b>personnel,</b> who are regularly exposed to anesthetic gases, can minimize oxidative stress and DNA damage considerably. Thus, it is advisable for <b>operating</b> room <b>personnel</b> to consume green tea as a natural antioxidant supplement. ...|$|R

In the event of exposure to these deadly bloodborne viral infections, <b>operating</b> room <b>personnel</b> must have a comprehensive postexposure prophylaxis plan to prevent {{the development of these}} deadly bloodborne viral infections. Goal: The broad mission of this course is to outline a comprehensive postexposure prophylaxis plan against deadly bloodborne viral infection that will reduce the frequency of these illnesses in both the <b>operating</b> room <b>personnel</b> as well as the patients. Objectives: At the completion of the training, the participant will be able to: 1. Describe the treatment of the exposure site. 2. Evaluate the type of exposure for its ability to produce a deadly bloodborne viral infection. 3. Complete a postexposure report for the <b>operating</b> room <b>personnel.</b> 4.

40|$|Regarding role of {{oxidative}} stress in <b>operating</b> room <b>personnel</b> and the anti {{oxidative stress}} potential of Cinnamon zeylanicum (cinnamon) in healthy subjects, {{the present study}} aimed to examine anti oxidative stress potential of cinnamon in <b>operating</b> room <b>personnel.</b> A group of 18 <b>operating</b> room <b>personnel</b> was invited to drink cinnamon (100 mg/ 300 mL tea) once daily for 10 days. Blood samples were obtained before and after entering the study and plasma was measured for oxidative stress biomarkers including Lipid Peroxidation Level (LPO), Total Antioxidant Power (TAP) and Total Thiol Molecules (TTM). Treatment of subjects with cinnamon induced {{a significant reduction in}} plasma LPO (5. 03 ± 2. 01 vs. 3. 25 ± 1. 32 nmol mL - 1, p = 0. 016). No statistically significant alteration was found for plasma TAP (1. 24 ± 0. 12 vs. 1. 28 ± 0. 12, p> 0. 05) and TTM (0. 78 ± 0. 05 vs. 0. 82 ± 0. 03, p> 0. 05) after 10 days treatment by cinnamon. In conclusion, reduction of cellular LPO by cinnamon as a dietary supplement can be a rational protocol to control source of hazards in <b>operating</b> room <b>personnel...</b>|$|R
