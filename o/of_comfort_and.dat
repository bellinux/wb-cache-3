25|$|Many {{sections}} of the country had reason to be dissatisfied with the existing autocracy. Nicholas II was a deeply conservative ruler and maintained a strict authoritarian system. Individuals and society in general were expected to show self-restraint, devotion to community, deference to the social hierarchy {{and a sense of}} duty to the country. Religious faith helped bind all of these tenets together as a source <b>of</b> <b>comfort</b> <b>and</b> reassurance in the face of difficult conditions and as a means of political authority exercised through the clergy. Perhaps more than any other modern monarch, Nicholas II attached his fate and the future of his dynasty to the notion of the ruler as a saintly and infallible father to his people.|$|E

40|$|Background: As {{the demand}} for {{occupational}} and physical therapists in acute care settings is increasing, students are reporting a need for increased educational preparation to handle the complexities they may face in this setting. This pretest/posttest study examines the impact of an inter-professional high fidelity simulation experience on perceived levels <b>of</b> knowledge, <b>comfort,</b> <b>and</b> confidence among occupational therapy doctorate students when handling an acutely ill patient in an ICU setting. Methods: Two cohorts of occupational therapy students participated in an inter-professional acute care scenario with high fidelity simulation mannequins (Cohort 1, n = 19; Cohort 2, n = 27). Before and after the simulation, the students rated their perceived level <b>of</b> knowledge, <b>comfort,</b> <b>and</b> confidence with handling acutely ill patients. Results: A two-tailed Wilcoxin Signed-Ranks indicated that posttest ranks were statistically significantly higher than pretest ranks with α =. 05 indicating improvement in students’ perceived levels <b>of</b> knowledge, <b>comfort,</b> <b>and</b> confidence after participating in an acute care simulation. Conclusion: High fidelity simulation can positively impact students’ perceptions <b>of</b> their knowledge, <b>comfort,</b> <b>and</b> confidence in handling acutely ill patients...|$|R

25|$|According to Ziethaml et al., layout affects {{how easy}} or {{difficult}} it is to navigate through a system. Signs and symbols provide cues for directional navigation and also inform about appropriate behaviour within a store. Functionality refers to extent to which the equipment and layout meet the goals of the customer. For instance, in the case of supermarkets, the customer's goal may be to minimise {{the amount of time spent}} finding items and waiting at the check-out, while a customer in a retail mall may wish to spend more time exploring the range of stores and merchandise. With respect to functionality of layout, retail designers consider three key issues; circulation– design for traffic-flow and that encourages customers to traverse the entire store; coordination– design that combines goods and spaces in order to suggest customer needs and convenience– design that arranges items to create a degree <b>of</b> <b>comfort</b> <b>and</b> access for both customers and employees.|$|E
25|$|The {{subsequent}} {{development and}} growth of the Kabala produced other forms of asceticism. In fact, the Ḥasid and the Ẓanua' of the medieval apocalyptic literature being a survival of Essenism, ablutions and fasting were resorted to by the adepts of the Cabala as means of attaining communion with the upper world. Some of these Ḥasidim would spend the whole week—without or with interruption, according to their physical endurance—in fasting, rendering only the Sabbath a day <b>of</b> <b>comfort</b> <b>and</b> joy. The object of their penitences and fastings was {{to bring about the}} time of divine favor, the Messianic era. Every Messianic movement had therefore Ascetics as leaders, such as were the Shabbethaians (see H. Grätz, Gesch. der Juden, iii. 307) and others (see Abraham ben Samuel Cohen of Lask). Others would refrain from eating animal food—'eber min ha-Ḥay—and, like the Buddhists or the Pythagoreans of old, live on vegetarian diet. The same is related by Epiphanius of the Dosithean sect.|$|E
25|$|Sport bikes {{emphasize}} top speed, acceleration, braking, {{handling and}} grip on paved roads, typically {{at the expense}} <b>of</b> <b>comfort</b> <b>and</b> fuel economy in comparison to less specialized motorcycles. Because of this, there are certain design elements that most motorcycles of this type will share. Sport bikes have comparatively high performance engines resting inside a lightweight frame. Inline-four engines dominate the sport bike category, with V-twins having a significant presence, and nearly every other engine configuration appearing in small numbers {{at one time or}} another. The combination of these elements helps maintain structural integrity and chassis rigidity. Braking systems combine higher performance brake pads and multi-piston calipers that clamp onto oversized vented rotors. Suspension systems are advanced in terms of adjustments and materials for increased stability and durability. Most sport bikes have fairings, often completely enclosing the engine, and windscreens that effectively deflect the air at very high speeds, or at least reduce overall drag.|$|E

On the basis of analysis I have given proposals for the refurbishment of the building from the perspective <b>of</b> user <b>comfort</b> <b>and</b> energy use.

Within my thesis I have proven that the building, regarding the current legislative requirements, is inappropriate both in the terms <b>of</b> thermal <b>comfort</b> <b>and</b> {{as well as from}} the perspective of energy efficiency. Visual comfort is partly insufficient. I have proposed measures for improving the <b>comfort</b> <b>and</b> energy balance <b>of</b> the airport building and evaluated them.

25|$|Electric cars enjoyed {{popularity}} {{between the}} late 19th century and early 20th century, when electricity {{was among the}} preferred methods for automobile propulsion, providing a level <b>of</b> <b>comfort</b> <b>and</b> ease of operation {{that could not be}} achieved by the gasoline cars of the time. Advances in internal combustion technology, especially the electric starter, soon rendered this advantage moot; the greater range of gasoline cars, quicker refueling times, and growing petroleum infrastructure, along with the mass production of gasoline vehicles by companies such as the Ford Motor Company, which reduced prices of gasoline cars to less than half that of equivalent electric cars, led to a decline in the use of electric propulsion, effectively removing it from important markets such as the United States by the 1930s. However, in recent years, increased concerns over the environmental impact of gasoline cars, higher gasoline prices, improvements in battery technology, and the prospect of peak oil, have brought about renewed interest in electric cars, which are perceived to be more environmentally friendly and cheaper to maintain and run, despite high initial costs, after a failed reappearance in the late-1990s.|$|E
25|$|The Theatre Royal {{went dark}} on 14 March 2011 {{due to a}} major {{restoration}} of the auditorium, box office, bars and restaurant. The restoration restored the theatre to the original 1901 Frank Matcham Edwardian interior. The whole interior was stripped apart from the original plasterwork which was carefully preserved. The proscenium arch, tiers and boxes were gold leafed and the plasterwork restored. On all levels the seats were replaced with Edwardian-style theatre seats {{in keeping with the}} restoration. The amphitheatre which was removed during previous renovations was restored to offer more leg room and better views than the gallery. This took the theatre to five distinct seating areas, the stalls, grand circle, upper circle, amphitheatre and gallery. Wheelchair spaces were installed on levels which had previously been inaccessible. As well as the boxes near the stage, boxes {{at the rear of the}} grand and upper circles were also restored taking the total number of boxes up to ten. The stage lift and orchestra pit were replaced to offer better facilities for opera and musicals. A new ventilation system was put in place to improve comfort levels in the theatre. New frescos for the lobby and upper circle were commissioned and put in place. This £4.75m project introduced higher standards <b>of</b> <b>comfort</b> <b>and</b> improved energy. The Theatre Royal reopened on 12 September 2011 with Alan Bennett’s epic period drama The Madness of George III; George III was in fact the monarch who gave the Theatre Royal its charter.|$|E

Barlow disagrees, arguing it is a common characteristic for dream narratives to have some normal elements in them, and that the normalcy of Jane's house in particular could represent the feeling <b>of</b> <b>comfort</b> <b>and</b> refuge Francis feels in her presence. Mike Budd argues while the Expressionistic visual style is jarring and off-putting at first, the characters start to blend more harmoniously as the film progresses, and the setting becomes more relegated into the background.|$|E

[...] Additionally, giving Peggy a lumpectomy at that stage of her disease was viewed favourably by source organisations, as it helped to spread a message that a mastectomy is not necessary in all breast cancer cases. However, the storyline was revisited several times over the next few years. In August 1997, Peggy was given the [...] "all-clear" [...] at her follow-up mammogram, and in March 1999 the cancer returned and she underwent a mastectomy, while in 2000 she had a breast reconstruction.
