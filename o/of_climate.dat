5|$|Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand {{presents}} {{a detailed analysis}} and refutation <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> change denial. In her foreword to the book, Naomi Oreskes writes that people fall victim to the phenomenon of denial due to feeling frightened. The book examines several arguments against global warming, and uses peer-reviewed evidence from the scientific consensus to back-up rationale for disputing the validity of each argument. The methodology of those denying climate change is assessed, including: cherry picking data purporting to support their specific viewpoints, maintaining a high bar for evidence <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> change by those denying it, and criticism of the values <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> scientists themselves. The book puts forth an explanation why certain individuals, and the wider public, {{have a tendency to}} deny the scientific consensus for climate change.|$|E

5|$|The book {{presents}} an in-depth analysis and refutation <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> change denial, going over several arguments point-by-point and disproving them with peer-reviewed {{evidence from the}} scientific consensus for climate change. The authors assert that those denying climate change engage in tactics including cherry picking data purported to support their specific viewpoints, and attacking the integrity <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> scientists. They use social science theory to examine the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> change denial in the wider public, and call this phenomenon a form of pathology.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} ways to {{classify}} climates into similar regimes. Originally, climes were defined in Ancient Greece to describe the weather depending upon a location's latitude. Modern climate classification methods can be broadly divided into genetic methods, which focus on the causes <b>of</b> <b>climate,</b> and empiric methods, which focus on the effects <b>of</b> <b>climate.</b> Examples of genetic classification include methods based on the relative frequency of different air mass types or locations within synoptic weather disturbances. Examples of empiric classifications include climate zones defined by plant hardiness, evapotranspiration, or more generally the Köppen climate classification which was originally designed to identify the climates associated with certain biomes. A common shortcoming of these classification schemes is that they produce distinct boundaries between the zones they define, rather than the gradual transition <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> properties more common in nature.|$|E

5|$|Banksia prionotes is {{susceptible}} {{to a number of}} threatening processes. It is highly {{susceptible to}} Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback; wild populations are harvested commercially by the cut flower industry; and some of its range is subject to land clearing for urban or agricultural purposes. An assessment of the potential impact <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> change on this species found that severe change is likely to lead to a reduction in its range of around 50% by 2080; and even mild change is projected to cause a reduction of 30%; but under mid-severity scenarios the distribution may actually grow, depending on how effectively it can migrate into newly habitable areas. However, this study does not address the potential <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> change to alter fire regimes; these have already been impacted by the arrival of humans, and this change is thought to have led to a decline in the abundance and range of B.prionotes.|$|E

5|$|Cook's {{education}} {{includes a}} background in physics. Prior to {{his work on the}} book, Cook founded the website Skeptical Science, which compiles peer-reviewed evidence <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> change. He placed on the site the most common assertions made by individuals arguing against the scientific consensus for climate change, with evidence to refute each point they made. After the publication <b>of</b> <b>Climate</b> Change Denial: Heads in the Sand, Cook coauthored another book on the subject, Climate Change Science: A Modern Synthesis: Volume 1– The Physical Climate (2013). In 2015, Cook served as the climate communication fellow at the University of Queensland.|$|E

5|$|The {{survival}} {{of this species}} is tied closely to rainfall because of the susceptibility of seedlings to drought. It is thus especially vulnerable to the effects <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> change. This was recognised as early as 1992, when {{it was noted that}} winter rainfall in the Quairading region had been falling by about 4% per decade, and that a continuation of this trend may reduce the species' distribution. Recently, a more thorough assessment of the potential impact <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> change on this species found that severe change is likely to lead to extinction, and mild change to a reduction of its range by 80% by 2080. However, there may not be any range reduction at all under mid-severity climate change, depending on how effectively this species can migrate into newly habitable areas.|$|E
