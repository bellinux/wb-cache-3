Moreover, the method should be able to make priority to handle these failures. 	This paper is aimed to define the potential failure mode and its effects on production process, with FMEA (Failure mode and Effects Analysis) method. Furthermore, to cope with the limitations of conventional FMEA method, which the failure-related cost is neglected, and that FMEA allocate the same weight to each indicator of RPN; thus in this paper it is used the Fuzzy cost-based FMEA. Three indicators in FMEA method; severity, occurrence and detection, are <b>ordinal</b> <b>scale</b> <b>variable,</b> thus those indicators are not able to define cost. 	As a result of this research, the RPI (Risk Priority Index) will be calculated as a base to prioritize the improvement efforts of identified failure modes...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, {{we focus}} on recent ordinal {{regression}} methods based on SVM and discriminant analysis [11 – 13]. The basic idea for realizing ordinal regression is estimating decision surfaces separating neighboring categories including <b>ordinal</b> <b>scale,</b> and this point is common in other ordinal regression methods that do not adopt SVM and discriminant analysis. The SVM-based methods regard separating hyperplanes as decision surfaces considering <b>ordinal</b> <b>scales</b> to keep the robustness realized by its generalization characteristic. On the other hand, discriminant analysis-based methods maximize between-class variance and minimize within-class variance to separate neighboring categories with maintenance of their <b>ordinal</b> <b>scales.</b> The details of the above methods are shown below.|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of prioritising requirements is widely recognised. A {{number of different}} techniques for prioritising requirements have been proposed, some based on an <b>ordinal</b> <b>scale,</b> others on a ratio scale. Some measurement scales provide more information than others, i. e. the ratio scale is richer than the <b>ordinal</b> <b>scale.</b> This paper aims to investigate {{the differences between the}} scales used in prioritisation. This is important since techniques using a richer scale tend to be more time-consuming and complex to use. Thus, there is a trade-off between simple techniques only providing ranks and complex techniques providing information about the relative distance between requirements priorities. The paper suggests an approach to measure the skewness of the ratio distribution and a way to use the cost-value approach on <b>ordinal</b> <b>scale</b> data. Four different empirical data sets were used to verify the suggested approaches. The skewness measure seems feasible to determine in which cases the ratio scale is valuable. It indicates that some of our subjects tend to use the extreme values of the scale while others are more modest. The cost-value approach based on <b>ordinal</b> <b>scale</b> data also seems feasible. The requirements selection decisions based on <b>ordinal</b> <b>scale</b> data agree substantially with the decisions based on ratio scale data. Copyright 2006 ACM...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{categorical}} variables in regression modeling is discussed. Some pitfalls {{in the use}} of numerically <b>scaled</b> <b>ordinal</b> <b>variables</b> are considered. ∗Prepared for delivery {{at the annual meeting of}} the Midwest Political Science Association, Chicago Illinois, April 2 - 5, 2009. In the day-to-day practice of social science, nominal and ordinal variables are the pre-dominant variable types. Survey data sets may contain the occasional numerical variable like “age ” (in years), but that type is grossly outweighed by the categorical indicators. Categor-ical variables are usually subdivided into “nominal ” and “ordinal ” types. The use of ordinal variables is the main focus of this paper. The presentation is not aimed at methodologists, but rather at practitioners who work with these very common data types. The basic idea that differentiates ordinal variables is that, in the eye of the person who uses the data, an observation’s membership in one category can somehow be interpreted as “less ” or “more ” than another observation’s membership in a different category. Ordinal variables may be based on judgment scales, so the ordering is not purely in the mind o...|$|R
