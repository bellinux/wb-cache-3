5|$|Extra {{training}} commenced {{on board}} ship, including how {{the men were}} {{to get to their}} boat stations to disembark. Each troop also rehearsed its own part in the mission. Lectures were given in escape and evasion and troop commanders and NCO's were given small silk maps of Norway to help with any escape attempt. Another item of escape equipment issued was a pair of trouser fly buttons that, when placed one <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> became a small compass.|$|E
5|$|Digital Dimension {{worked on}} 200 visual effects {{shots in the}} film, {{including}} the sequence that shows characters John McClane and Matt Farrell crouching between two cars as another car lands <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> cars. To achieve this effect, a crane yanked the car and {{threw it in the}} air onto the two cars that were also being pulled by cables. The shot was completed when the two characters were integrated into the footage of the car stunt after the lighting was adjusted and CGI glass and debris were added. In the same sequence, John McClane destroys a helicopter that several of Gabriel's henchman are riding in by ramming it with a car. This was accomplished by first filming one take where one of Gabriel's henchman, Rand, jumps from the helicopter, and in the next take the car is propelled into the stationary helicopter as it is hoisted by wires. The final view of the shot overlays the two takes, with added CGI for the debris and moving rotor blades. The company also assisted in adding cars for traffic collisions and masses of people for evacuations from several government buildings.|$|E

25|$|Tsetse can be {{distinguished}} from other large flies by two easily observed features. Tsetse fold their wings completely when they are resting so that one wing rests directly <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> over their abdomens. Tsetse also have a long proboscis, which extends directly forward and is attached by a distinct bulb {{to the bottom of}} their heads.|$|E

25|$|A bass line {{typically}} {{consists of}} four or five musicians, each carrying one tuned bass drum, although variations do occur.

25|$|Shoelaces are {{typically}} tied {{off at the}} top of the shoe using a simple bow knot. Besides securing the shoe, this also takes up the length of shoelace exposed after tightening. The common bow consists of two half-knots tied one <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> with the second half-knot looped in order to allow quick untying. When required, the knot can be readily loosened by pulling one or both of the loose ends.|$|E

25|$|The {{ceremonial}} centers {{were always}} built to be visible. The pyramids {{were meant to}} {{stand out from the}} rest of the city, to represent its gods and their powers. Another characteristic feature of the ceremonial centers is historic layers. All of the ceremonial edifices were built in various phases, one <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> to the point that what we now see is usually the last stage of construction. Ultimately, the ceremonial centers were the architectural translation of the identity of each city, as represented by the veneration of their gods and masters. Stelae were common public monuments throughout Mesoamerica, and served to commemorate notable successes, events and dates associated with the rulers and nobility of the various sites.|$|E
25|$|Building of Boca Juniors' current stadium {{began in}} 1938, under the {{supervision}} of Engineer José L. Delpini. Boca played its home matches in the Ferro Carril Oeste ground in Caballito until it was completed in May 25, 1940. A third level was added in 1953, originating then its nickname La Bombonera ('The Chocolate Box'). The stand opposite the Casa Amarilla railway platforms remained mostly undeveloped until 1996, when it was upgraded with new balconies and quite expensive VIP boxes. Three sides of the Bombonera are thus made up of traditional sloping stadium stands, but the fourth side was built vertically, with several seating areas stacked one <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> the only way that makes it stand into the club premises.|$|E
25|$|Sephardi-style hamin {{typically}} includes whole {{eggs in the}} shell, {{which are}} placed {{on top of the}} mixture in the stewing pot and turn brown in the course of all-night cooking. The brown eggs, called haminados (güevos haminadavos in Ladino, huevos haminados in Spanish), are shelled before serving and placed <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> cooked ingredients. In a Tunisian version, the brown eggs are cooked separately in a metal pot on the all-night stove with water and tea leaves (similar to tea eggs). Haminados can be cooked in this way even if no hamin is prepared. The addition of tea leaves, coffee grinds, or onion skins to the water dyes the shell purple and the white a light brown, giving the egg a smooth creamy texture. In Israel, brown eggs are a popular accompaniment to ful medames (a dish of mashed broad beans) and they may also be served with hummus (a dip of mashed chickpeas mixed with tahini) and in a Sabich sandwich.|$|E

25|$|People try to {{stay awake}} and eat toshikoshisoba, noodles to be eaten at midnight. People also visit Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines. Traditionally three are visited. This is called sansha-mairi. In the Imperial Palace at dawn on the 1st, the Emperor {{performs}} the rite of shihōhai (worship of the four-quarters), in which he offers prayers {{for the well-being of}} the nation. On January 2 the public is allowed to enter the inner palace grounds; the only other day this is possible is the Emperor's birthday (December 23). On the 2nd and 3rd days acquaintances visit one another to extend greetings (nenshi) and sip otoso (a spiced rice wine). Some games played at New Year's are karuta (a card game), hanetsuki (similar to badminton), tako age (kiteflying), and komamawashi (spinning tops). These games are played to bring more luck for the year. Exchanging New Year's greeting cards (similar to Christmas Cards) is another important Japanese custom. Also special allowances are given to children, which are called otoshidama. They also decorate their entrances with kagami mochi (two mochi rice balls placed one <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> with a tangerine on top), and kadomatsu (pine tree decorations).|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} bout was {{the last}} match in the Terri Invitational Tournament, contested between The New Brood (Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy) and Edge and Christian in a tag team ladder match. For the match, a bag with 100,000 dollars was hung from the ceiling, and {{the goal of the}} match was to use one of the two ladders in the ring to climb and retrieve the bag. The first team to retrieve the bag would win the match. The manager of The New Brood, Gangrel brought a ladder to the ring, but as a result, he got ejected from ringside by the referee. During the match, the ladders were set up so that one was <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> resembling a Seesaw, Jeff jumped on one side so that the other side jutted upwards, knocking down both Matt and Christian. Later in the match, all four men were on the ladders and after Edge pushed Matt off of the ladder they were both on, he fell into the other ladder, knocking Christian to the mat. Jeff however, jumped onto the other ladder to continue to battle with Edge. As Jeff and Edge climbed the ladder, Jeff pushed Edge to the ground and grabbed the bag of money to win the match. As a result of winning the match, The New Brood won $100,000 and the managerial services of Terri Runnels. Backstage, the trio celebrated the win and their new partnership with a bottle of champagne.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} common, and simplest, {{waveguide}} directional couplers is the Bethe-hole directional coupler.

500|$|The Moreno crossed-guide coupler has two waveguides stacked one <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> {{like the}} Bethe-hole coupler but {{at right angles}} to each other instead of parallel.
