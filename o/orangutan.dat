Since being freed, the <b>orangutan,</b> named Pony, {{has been living}} with the Borneo <b>Orangutan</b> Survival Foundation. She has been re-socialised to live with other orangutans.|$|E
5|$|In November 2017, {{researchers}} found genomic {{evidence for a}} new species of <b>orangutan</b> named, Pongo tapanuliensis, found only in the Batang Toru forest of Sumatra, Indonesia. It is estimated that fewer than 800 individuals still exist, which puts the Tapanuli <b>orangutan</b> among the most endangered of great apes.|$|E
5|$|The Kuching <b>Orangutan</b> Murals {{are vital}} {{images of a}} {{wheelbarrow}} filled with eight young orangutans and another baby <b>orangutan</b> swinging from a pipe. It was painted by Ernest Zacharevic along Power Street in the city on 27 April 2014. This latest mural is painted in Zacharevic's usual interactive style, with an actual wheelbarrow sliced into half and secured to the wall to enable the public to take selfies while holding onto the handle. On the other hand, the baby <b>orangutan</b> was painted over a nail on the wall, where people can 'place' items in its hand.|$|E
40|$|The diploma {{thesis is}} focused on the {{situation}} of the captive <b>orangutans</b> and the theme of <b>orangutans</b> in the school-books for primary schools and high schools. The captive <b>orangutans</b> have different surroundings than wild <b>orangutans.</b> Unsuitable conditions can be the causation of <b>orangutans</b> unfitting behavior. So {{it is very important to}} make such suitable surroundings for captive <b>orangutans</b> that it can evolve the behavior, skills and acquirement of <b>orangutans.</b> The main aim of the diploma thesis, based on theoretical insight, was to inscribe the behavioral differences between wild and captive <b>orangutans.</b> The description of the captive <b>orangutans</b> in the Prague ZOO is getting evolve this theme. The school-books analysis, work sheet and the presentation about <b>orangutans</b> could be useful for teachers. Powered by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|R
5|$|However, nuclear DNA {{sequence}} comparisons {{reported in}} 2017 suggest that Tapanuli <b>orangutans</b> diverged from Sumatran <b>orangutans</b> about 3.4 million years ago. Tapanuli <b>orangutans</b> diverged from Bornean <b>orangutans,</b> much later, about 670,000 years ago. <b>Orangutans</b> travelled from Sumatra to Borneo as the islands were connected by land bridges {{as parts of}} Sundaland during recent glacial periods when sea levels were much lower. The present range of Tapanuli <b>orangutans</b> {{is thought to be}} close to the point where ancestral <b>orangutans</b> first entered what is now Indonesia from mainland Asia.|$|R
50|$|<b>Orangutans</b> build day {{and night}} nests. Young <b>orangutans</b> learn by observing their mother's nest-building behaviour. Nest-building is a leading reason for young <b>orangutans</b> leaving their mother for the first time. Starting at 6 months of age, <b>orangutans</b> {{practice}} nest building and gain proficiency {{by the time they}} are 3 years old.|$|R
5|$|The orangutans (also spelled orang-utan, orangutang, or orang-utang) {{are three}} extant species of great apes native to Indonesia and Malaysia. Orangutans are {{currently}} only {{found in the}} rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. Classified in the genus Pongo, orangutans were originally considered to be one species. From 1996, they {{were divided into two}} species: the Bornean <b>orangutan</b> (P. pygmaeus, with three subspecies) and the Sumatran <b>orangutan</b> (P. abelii). In November 2017 it was reported that a third species had been identified, the Tapanuli <b>orangutan</b> (P. tapanuliensis).|$|E
5|$|A {{persistent}} folktale on Sumatra and Borneo and {{in popular}} culture, is that male orangutans display sexual attraction to human women, {{and may even}} forcibly copulate with them. The only serious, but anecdotal, report of such an incident taking place, is primatologist Birutė Galdikas' report that her cook was sexually assaulted by a male <b>orangutan.</b> This <b>orangutan,</b> though, was raised in captivity and may have suffered from a skewed species identity, and forced copulation is a standard mating strategy for low-ranking male orangutans.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} <b>orangutan</b> {{symbolic}} capability was conducted from 1973 to 1975 by zoologist Gary L. Shapiro with Aazk, a juvenile female <b>orangutan</b> at the Fresno City Zoo (now Chaffee Zoo) in Fresno, California. The study employed {{the techniques of}} psychologist David Premack, who used plastic tokens to teach linguistic skills to the chimpanzee, Sarah. Shapiro continued to examine the linguistic and learning abilities of ex-captive orangutans in Tanjung Puting National Park, in Indonesian Borneo, between 1978 and 1980.|$|E
5|$|<b>Orangutans</b> live {{in primary}} and old {{secondary}} forests, particularly dipterocarp forests and peat swamp forests. Both species {{can be found}} in mountainous and lowland swampy areas. Sumatran <b>orangutans</b> live at elevations as high as 1500m (4921ft), while Bornean <b>orangutans</b> live no higher than 1000m (3281ft). Other habitats used by <b>orangutans</b> include grasslands, cultivated fields, gardens, young secondary forest, and shallow lakes. <b>Orangutans</b> are the most arboreal of the great apes, spending nearly all their time in the trees.|$|R
50|$|A seven-year {{longitudinal}} {{study published in}} 2011 looked at whether the lifespan of zoo-housed <b>orangutans</b> was related to a subjective assessment of well-being, {{with the intent of}} applying such measures to assess the welfare of <b>orangutans</b> in captivity. Of the subjects, 100 were Sumatran (Pongo abelii), 54 Bornean (Pongo pygmaeus) and 30 were hybrid <b>orangutans.</b> 113 zoo employees, who were highly familiar with the typical behavior of the <b>orangutans,</b> used a four-item questionnaire to assess their subjective well-being. The results indicated that <b>orangutans</b> in higher subjective well-being were less likely to die during the follow-up period. The study concluded that happiness was related to longer life in <b>orangutans.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Orangutans</b> build nests {{specialized}} {{for both}} {{day or night}} use. These are carefully constructed; young <b>orangutans</b> learn from observing their mother's nest-building behaviour. In fact, nest-building is a leading cause in young <b>orangutans</b> leaving their mother for the first time. From six months of age onwards, <b>orangutans</b> practice nest-building and gain proficiency {{by the time they}} are three years old.|$|R
5|$|An <b>orangutan</b> {{has a large}}, bulky body, a thick neck, very long, strong arms, short, bowed legs, and no tail. It {{is mostly}} covered with long, reddish-brown hair and grey-black skin. Sumatran orangutans have more sparse and lighter-coloured coats. The <b>orangutan</b> has a large head with a {{prominent}} mouth area. Though largely hairless, their faces can develop some hair in males, giving them a moustache.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, {{researchers}} from six different <b>orangutan</b> field sites {{who used the}} same behavioural coding scheme compared the behaviours of the animals from the different sites. They found the different <b>orangutan</b> populations behaved differently. The evidence suggested the differences were cultural: first, {{the extent of the}} differences increased with distance, suggesting cultural diffusion was occurring, and second, the size of the orangutans' cultural repertoire increased according to the amount of social contact present within the group. Social contact facilitates cultural transmission.|$|E

25|$|Since 2006, Perth Zoo {{has made}} a {{significant}} contribution to conservation projects in the Bukit Tigapuluh National Park and the surrounding forested areas which support a rich diversity of life including a new colony of <b>orangutans.</b> These <b>orangutans</b> are part of an international program to reintroduce rescued ex-pet and orphaned Sumatran <b>orangutans</b> into the wild to establish a new population of this critically endangered species. More than 139 <b>orangutans</b> have been released into the area and some have bred.|$|R
5|$|Tool use in <b>orangutans</b> was {{observed}} by primatologist Birutė Galdikas in ex-captive populations. In addition, evidence of sophisticated tool manufacture and {{use in the}} wild was reported from a population of <b>orangutans</b> in Suaq Balimbing (Pongo abelii) in 1996. These <b>orangutans</b> developed a tool kit for use in foraging that consisted of both insect-extraction tools {{for use in the}} hollows of trees and seed-extraction tools for harvesting seeds from hard-husked fruit. The <b>orangutans</b> adjusted their tools according {{to the nature of the}} task at hand, and preference was given to oral tool use. This preference was also found in an experimental study of captive <b>orangutans</b> (P. pygmaeus).|$|R
5|$|The Sumatran <b>orangutan</b> genome was sequenced in January 2011. Following {{humans and}} chimpanzees, the Sumatran <b>orangutan</b> became the third species of hominid {{to have its}} genome sequenced. Subsequently, the Bornean species had its genome sequenced. Genetic {{diversity}} {{was found to be}} lower in Bornean orangutans (P.pygmaeus) than in Sumatran ones (P.abelii), despite the fact that Borneo is home to six or seven times as many orangutans as Sumatra.|$|E

5|$|The sailor {{offers to}} pay a reward, but Dupin is {{interested}} only in learning the circumstances behind the two murders. The sailor explains that he captured the <b>orangutan</b> while in Borneo and brought it back to Paris, but had trouble keeping it under control. When he saw the <b>orangutan</b> attempting to shave its face with his straight razor, imitating his morning grooming, it fled into the streets and reached the Rue Morgue, where it climbed up and into the house. The <b>orangutan</b> seized the mother by the hair and was waving the razor, imitating a barber; when she screamed in fear, it flew into a rage, ripped her hair out, slashed her throat, and strangled the daughter. The sailor climbed up the lightning rod {{in an attempt to}} catch the animal, and the two voices heard by witnesses belonged to it and to him. Fearing punishment by its master, the <b>orangutan</b> threw the mother's body out the window and stuffed the daughter into the chimney before fleeing.|$|E
40|$|After <b>orangutans</b> in Indonesia were {{reported}} as infected with Plasmodium cynomolgi and P. vivax, we conducted phylogenetic analyses of small subunit ribosomal RNA gene sequences of Plasmodium spp. We found that these <b>orangutans</b> are not hosts of P. cynomolgi and P. vivax.

One houses seven <b>orangutans</b> (two males named Kiko and Kyle; four females named Lucy, Batang, Iris and Bonnie; and a male infant named Redd, born in 2016). The other houses six western lowland gorillas (three males named Baraka, Kojo and Kwame; and three females named Mandara, Kibibi and Calaya). The <b>orangutans</b> are allowed access to the Think Tank (see below) by travelling along the [...] "O-Line", a series of high cables supported by metal towers that enable the <b>orangutans</b> to move between the two buildings. Kyle, Batang and Redd are Bornean <b>orangutans</b> and Kiko, Lucy, Iris and Bonnie are all hybrid <b>orangutans.</b>|$|R

5|$|Orangutans {{are among}} the most {{intelligent}} primates; they use a variety of sophisticated tools and construct elaborate sleeping nests each night from branches and foliage. The apes have been extensively studied for their learning abilities. There may even be distinctive cultures within populations. Field studies of the apes were pioneered by primatologist Birutė Galdikas. All three <b>orangutan</b> species are considered to be critically endangered. Human activities have caused severe declines in populations and ranges. Threats to wild <b>orangutan</b> populations include poaching, habitat destruction, and the illegal pet trade. Several conservation and rehabilitation organisations are dedicated to the survival of orangutans in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Other major {{conservation}} centres in Indonesia {{include those}} at Tanjung Puting National Park and Sebangau National Park in Central Kalimantan, Kutai in East Kalimantan, Gunung Palung National Park in West Kalimantan, and Bukit Lawang in the Gunung Leuser National Park {{on the border}} of Aceh and North Sumatra. In Malaysia, conservation areas include Semenggoh Wildlife Centre in Sarawak and Matang Wildlife Centre also in Sarawak, and the Sepilok Orang Utan Sanctuary near Sandakan in Sabah. Major conservation centres that are headquartered outside of the orangutan's home countries; include Frankfurt Zoological Society, <b>Orangutan</b> Foundation International, which was founded by Birutė Galdikas, and the Australian <b>Orangutan</b> Project.|$|E
40|$|Background Upper {{respiratory}} tract disease (URTD) {{is a significant}} cause of morbidity in captive <b>orangutans</b> (Pongo abelii, Pongo pygmaeus), and the pathogenesis is often unknown. Methods The prevalence of respiratory disease in captive European <b>orangutans</b> (201 animals; 20 zoos) and possible predisposing factors were investigated.

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates how the 'fission-fusionadapted' bonobos and Bornean <b>orangutans</b> manage social {{relationships}} when kept under permanent groupliving conditions. Our {{results showed that}} the bonobos and <b>orangutans</b> did not differ in the overall frequency of dyadic interactions. The <b>orangutans</b> evidently realized a potential to interact with partners, which on a surface did not differ from what was found in the bonobos. However, the bonobos spent more time on sociopositive interactions, especially on grooming and sit in contact, whereas the <b>orangutans</b> agonistically interacted with each other more often. Though frequencies of approaching were similar between the two species, <b>orangutans</b> actively left the proximity to a partner more often than the bonobos, which in turn were more often in spatial proximity. The three groups of bonobos housed under different conditions differed from each other for sociopositive and agonistic interactions. The <b>orangutans</b> differed for agonistic but not for sociopositive interactions. As a striking difference between the species, it appeared that between subadult/adult <b>orangutans,</b> behaviours which required prolonged body contact occurred only rarely and briefly. Differences in bonding patterns have been discussed as a possible explanatory factor. The 'short and distant nature' of interactions between adult <b>orangutans</b> suggests the existence of social relationships, the management of which requires less 'servicing behaviours'. Subadult/adult <b>orangutans</b> may be less attracted by each other than individuals in more gregarious species: they may have the cognitive skills to interact, but may not be motivated to stay together for long...|$|R
5|$|Female <b>orangutans</b> {{experience}} {{their first}} ovulatory cycle around 5.8–11.1years. These occur earlier in females with more body fat. Like other great apes, female <b>orangutans</b> enter {{a period of}} infertility during adolescence which may last for 1–4years. Female <b>orangutans</b> also have a 22– to 30-day menstrual cycle. Gestation lasts for 9 months, with females giving birth to their first offspring {{between the ages of}} 14 and 15years.|$|R
5|$|The populations {{on the two}} islands were {{classified}} as separate species when P. abelii was described by Lesson in 1827. Later P. abelii was placed under P. pygmaeus, first as a synonym, then in 1985 as a subspecies. In 1996, P. abelii was elevated back to full species status, and the three distinct populations on Borneo were elevated to subspecies. The population currently listed as P.p.wurmbii may {{be closer to the}} Sumatran <b>orangutan</b> than the other Bornean <b>orangutan</b> subspecies. If confirmed, abelii would be a subspecies of P.wurmbii (Tiedeman, 1808).|$|E
