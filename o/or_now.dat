25|$|Possibly in the 2nd-3rd and {{certainly}} {{starting with the}} 5th-6th centuries, Christian religious structures were built at Tell al-Kharrar. It must be remembered that in the 1st-4th centuries of the Christian Era, Christianity was often persecuted by the Roman state, and only after it became first tolerated and then outright the state religion of the Roman, <b>or</b> <b>now</b> so-called Byzantine Empire, open Christian worship became possible.|$|E
25|$|Multivariate {{modeling}} {{can give}} {{answers to questions}} about the genetic relationship between variables that appear independent. For instance: do IQ and long-term memory share genes?

In addition, models avoid constraint problems in the crude correlation method: all parameters will lie, as they should, between 0–1 (standardized).|$|E

25|$|A new {{consciousness}} of the inequality of American women began sweeping the nation, starting with the 1963 publication of Betty Friedan's best-seller, The Feminine Mystique, which explained how many housewives felt trapped and unfulfilled, assaulted American culture for its creation {{of the notion that}} women could only find fulfillment through their roles as wives, mothers, and keepers of the home, and argued that women were just as able as men to do every type of job. In 1966 Friedan and others established the National Organization for Women, <b>or</b> <b>NOW,</b> to act for women as the NAACP did for African Americans.|$|E
25|$|In 1946 Congress {{established}} the civilian Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{to take over}} the development of nuclear weapons from the military, and to develop nuclear power. The AEC made use of many private companies in processing uranium and thorium and in other urgent tasks related to the development of bombs. Many of these companies had very lax safety measures and employees were sometimes exposed to radiation levels far above what was allowed then <b>or</b> <b>now.</b> In 1974, the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP) of the Army Corps of Engineers was set up to deal with contaminated sites left over from these operations.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{the first}} meeting of the Football Association in the Freemasons' Tavern in Great Queen Street, London on 26 October 1863, there were no universally {{accepted}} rules for the playing of the game of football.

(No Names) Club (Kilburn), the original Crystal Palace, Blackheath, Kensington School, Percival House (Blackheath), Surbiton and Blackheath Proprietary School; Charterhouse sent its captain, B.F.

25|$|Another {{example of}} the issues {{involved}} {{is the case of}} converts to Judaism who cease to practice Judaism (whether or not they still regard themselves as Jewish), do not accept or follow halakha, <b>or</b> <b>now</b> adhere to another religion. Technically, such a person remains Jewish, like all Jews, provided that the original conversion is valid. However, in some recent cases, Haredi rabbinical authorities, as well as the current Religious Zionist Israeli Chief Rabbinate, have taken the view that a given convert's lapse from Orthodox Jewish observance is evidence that he or she cannot, even {{at the time of the}} conversion, have had the full intention to observe the commandments, and that the conversion must therefore have been invalid.|$|E
25|$|The final {{retirement}} of the Republican lion came in 1815 {{with the establishment}} of the “United Kingdom of the Netherlands”. Because this new kingdom comprised not only of the lands of the former Dutch Republic but also of the former Austrian or Southern Netherlands it was also not appropriate to continue the use of the old arms. First a combination with the arms of Brabant (Sable a Lion <b>Or,</b> <b>now</b> the coat of arms of Belgium) was considered. In the end the attributes, the sword, arrows and crown, were placed in the care of his older “colleague” from Nassau to symbolize the union between the (now Royal) House of Nassau and the Netherlands. As seen above, this is still the basis of the current coat of arms.|$|E
25|$|By 1841, when Evans {{cast the}} first movable type for syllabics, {{he found that}} he could not satisfactorily {{maintain}} the distinction between light and heavy typeface for short and long vowels. He instead filed across the raised lines of the type, leaving gaps in the printed letter for long vowels. This can be seen in early printings. Later still a dot diacritic, originally used for vowel length only in handwriting, was extended to print: Thus today ᐊ a contrasts with ᐋ â, and ᒥ mi contrasts with ᒦ mî. Although Cree ê only occurs long, the script made length distinctions for all four vowels. Not all writers then <b>or</b> <b>now</b> indicate length, or do not do so consistently; since there is no contrast, no one today writes ê as a long vowel.|$|E

25|$|In the Netherlands and Belgium, people {{annually}} celebrate St. Nicolas Eve with Sinterklaas {{accompanied by}} multiple Zwarte Pieten {{in the form}} of adolescent boys and girls, and men and women, who use blackface <b>or</b> <b>now</b> more often in large city parades in different colors and styles while wearing Moorish page boy costumes. The Moorish Zwarte Piet character has been traced back {{to the middle of the}} 19th century when Jan Schenkman, a popular children's book author, added an African servant to the Sinterklaas story. However, the original and archetypal Zwarte Piet is believed to be a continuation of a much older custom in which people with black faces appeared in Winter Solstice rituals. In other parts of Western Europe and in Central Europe, black-faced and masked people also perform the role of companions of Saint Nicholas, who is known as Nikolo in Austria, Niklaus in Germany and Samichlaus in Switzerland. Also on Saint Martin's Eve, black-faced men go around in processions through Wörgl and the Lower Inn Valley, in Tyrol.|$|E
25|$|India has a large, low-income, rural {{population}} with {{limited access to}} formal banking facilities. This leads to teh absenc of two major helplines for poorer people - that of placing their money safely in deposits and secondly {{of being able to}} borrow money fr their needs which may be as simple as buying seeds for the next crop or their children's marriage. The second aim is achieved instead by a web of parallel, informal banking in the form of money lenders (pawn brokers) who have existed in India for a few centuries. At its centre are moneylenders, mostly unregulated, often also wealthy landlords <b>or</b> <b>now</b> politicians, used to charge exorbitant rates of interest. To curb this practice, several Moneylenders Acts were enacted by the State governments of India by the 1950s. However failure to replace the role of moneylenders gave rise to unscrupulous financial operators that operated Ponzi schemes. Some commentators place the blame for these kinds of Ponzi schemes on greed rather than exclusion from formal banking systems.|$|E
25|$|Gates are the {{watertight}} doors which seal off the chamber {{from the upper}} and lower pounds. Each end of the chamber is equipped with a gate, or pair of half-gates, made of oak or elm (<b>or</b> <b>now</b> sometimes steel). The most common arrangement, usually called miter gates, was invented by Leonardo da Vinci, sometime around the late 15th century. When closed, a pair meet at an angle like a chevron pointing upstream and only a very small difference in water-level is necessary to squeeze the closed gates securely together. This reduces any leaks from between them and prevents their being opened until water levels have equalised. If the chamber is not full, the top gate is secure; and if the chamber is not completely empty, the bottom gate is secure (in normal operation, therefore, the chamber cannot be open at both ends). A lower gate is taller than an upper gate, because the upper gate only has to be tall enough to close off the upper pound, while the lower gate {{has to be able to}} seal off a full chamber. The upper gate is as tall as the canal is deep, plus a little more for the balance beam, winding mechanism, etc.; the lower gate's height equals the upper gate plus the lock's rise.|$|E

The village of Combwich lies adjacent to a channel in the river known as [...] "Combwich Reach"; from here the Parrett flows to the Bristol Channel past the Steart Peninsula.

500|$|In 1628, Tokugawa Hidetada, by {{then the}} retired second shogun, {{attended}} ceremonies conducted {{in honor of his}} late mother on the anniversary of her death.

[...] [...] At the same time, the Emperor Go-Mizunoo conferred the name Minamoto Masako (...) upon Lady Saigō, in effect posthumously adopting her into the Minamoto clan, the extended family of the Imperial line.

500|$|... "Lotto" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics.

When the show wants to give Jim, or Pam, or Dwight, <b>or</b> <b>now</b> Andy a quiet, emotional moment, it's usually still able to do so very well, and that includes most of Andy and Darryl's interaction here in 'Lotto. He was, however, more critical of the episode's humor, noting that many of gags had been done before. The A.V. Club reviewer Myles McNutt called the episode superior to the previous episode commenting that [...] "While perhaps not monumentally better than last week's outing and damaged by a weak B-story, 'Lotto' had a greater sense of purpose that holds greater value to the season as it moves forward". He also complimented the writers for not focusing too much on Andy. He ultimately gave the episode a [...] "B".|$|E
