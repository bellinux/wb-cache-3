5|$|Club Europe is the short-haul {{business}} class on all short-haul flights. This class allows {{for access to}} business lounges at most airports. Club Europe provides seats in a 2–2 configuration on narrowbody aircraft, with the middle seat not used. Instead, a table folds up from under the middle seat on refurbished aircraft. Pillows and blankets are available <b>on</b> <b>longer</b> flights.|$|E
5|$|Locomotive tenders {{were also}} changed as new, {{improved}} designs became available. Some {{examples of the}} second batch (70025–70029) were equipped with the BR1A tender, which had a higher water capacity of 5,000 gallons. Members of the third batch (70045–70054) were equipped with another tender design, the BR1D, which had 9 tons of coal and 4,750 gallons of water, {{due to the fact}} that they were intended for use <b>on</b> <b>longer</b> runs in the north of the railway network. This tender design also featured a steam-powered coal pusher, which eliminated the need for crew members to mount the tender to pull forward coal when the locomotive was at a stop.|$|E
5|$|The Airbus A320neo family {{aircraft}} {{ordered in}} 2011 {{were to be}} delivered starting 2015. However, due to a delay in the production and delivery of these aircraft, IndiGo dry-leased a total of 22 used aircraft {{to cope with the}} demand. On 15 October 2014, IndiGo expressed its intention to order a further 250 A320neo aircraft worth US$25.7 billion at list prices. On 15 August 2015, IndiGo confirmed the order for 250 A320neo aircraft for $26.5 billion. The order also provides IndiGo the flexibility to convert some A320neos to A321neos that can seat more passengers and fly <b>on</b> <b>longer</b> routes. The order of 250 jets was Airbus' single largest order by number of aircraft. Indigo received the first A320neo in March 2016.|$|E

5|$|Women's lacrosse, a {{non-contact}} {{version of}} the sport originating in Scotland during the 1890s, is played by twelve players per side, <b>on</b> <b>longer</b> fields and with less protective equipment than the men's game requires. In the 1930s Canadian businessmen established a version called box lacrosse to create business for ice hockey arenas during the summer months. Box lacrosse is played indoors, with smaller nets, between two teams of six players, and strongly resembles the game its areas were designed for.|$|E
5|$|Each civilization can {{purchase}} upgrades {{that increase the}} rate of gathering these resources. Players can construct a marketplace for trade; players can trade wood, stone, and food for gold, and use gold to buy other resources. Market prices fluctuate with every transaction. Furthermore, markets and docks can also generate gold by using trading carts or cogs which are used to visit foreign markets and ports; once they return to the player's market/dock, gold {{is added to the}} stockpile. The amount of gold a trade unit earns on each trip is related to the distance it had to travel to a foreign market; more gold is earned <b>on</b> <b>longer</b> trips. It is possible to trade with enemies' markets or docks, but the player's trading units may be attacked or destroyed by enemy units in the process. Players do not need to keep trading manually, as once they select the port or market the trading units infinitely continue to trade.|$|E
5|$|Hyperion is Titan's nearest {{neighbor}} in the Saturn system. The two moons {{are locked in}} a 4:3 mean-motion resonance with each other, meaning that while Titan makes four revolutions around Saturn, Hyperion makes exactly three. With an average diameter of about 270km, Hyperion is smaller and lighter than Mimas. It has an extremely irregular shape, and a very odd, tan-colored icy surface resembling a sponge, though its interior may be partially porous as well. The average density of about 0.55g/cm3 indicates that the porosity exceeds 40% even assuming it has a purely icy composition. The surface of Hyperion is covered with numerous impact craters—those with diameters 2–10km are especially abundant. It is the only moon besides the small moons of Pluto known to have a chaotic rotation, which means Hyperion has no well-defined poles or equator. While on short timescales the satellite approximately rotates around its long axis {{at a rate of}} 72–75° per day, <b>on</b> <b>longer</b> timescales its axis of rotation (spin vector) wanders chaotically across the sky. This makes the rotational behavior of Hyperion essentially unpredictable.|$|E

25|$|A natural pitch {{with grass}} longer or more moist than usual is {{described}} as a green pitch or green seamer.

25|$|Cross-country ski venues often {{comprise}} {{a system of}} trails or loipes of varying length and difficulty that loop back to a starting point. Often trails branch out from a common segment; the more challenging ones then branch off <b>on</b> <b>longer</b> legs. The length of each loop, including segments that coincide with other loops, is typically counted separately. Consequently, the total length of loops {{is greater than the}} total length of trail structure.|$|E
