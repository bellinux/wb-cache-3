He stopped {{a moment on}} seeing Bernard, glanced at his wife, blushed, flushed, and with a loud, frank exclamation of pleasure, grasped his friend by both hands. It was so long since he had seen Bernard that he seemed a good deal moved; he stood there smiling, {{clasping}} his hands, looking him in the eyes, unable for some moments to speak. Bernard, on his side, was greatly pleased; it was delightful to him to look into Gordon's honest face again and to return his manly grasp. And he looked well--he looked happy; to see that was more delightful yet. During these few instants, while they exchanged a silent pledge of renewed friendship, Bernard's elastic perception embraced several things besides the consciousness of his own pleasure. He saw that Gordon looked well and happy, but that he looked older, too, and more serious, more marked by life. He looked as if {{something had happened to}} him--as, in fact, something had. Bernard saw a latent spark in his friend's eye that seemed to question his own for an impression of Blanche--to question it eagerly, and yet to deprecate judgment. He saw, too--with the fact made more vivid by Gordon's standing there beside her in his manly sincerity and throwing it into contrast--that Blanche was the same little posturing coquette of a Blanche whom, at Baden, he would have treated it as a broad joke that Gordon Wright should dream of marrying. He saw, in a word, that it was what it had first struck him as being--an incongruous union. All this was a good deal for Bernard to see in the course of half a minute, especially through the rather <b>opaque</b> <b>medium</b> of a feeling of irreflective joy; and his impressions at this moment have a value only in so far as they were destined to be confirmed by larger opportunity.|$|E
60|$|When {{we define}} {{the cause of}} any thing (in the only sense in which the present inquiry has any concern with causes) to be “the {{antecedent}} which it invariably follows,” we do not use this phrase as exactly synonymous with “the antecedent which it invariably has followed in our past experience.” Such a mode of conceiving causation would be liable to the objection very plausibly urged by Dr. Reid, namely, that according to this doctrine night must {{be the cause of}} day, and day the cause of night; since these phenomena have invariably succeeded one another {{from the beginning of the}} world. But it is necessary to our using the word cause, that we should believe not only that the antecedent always has been followed by the consequent, but that, as long as the present constitution of things(116) endures, it always will be so. And this would not be true of day and night. We do not believe that night will be followed by day under all imaginable circumstances, but only that it will be so provided the sun rises above the horizon. If the sun ceased to rise, which, for aught we know, may be perfectly compatible with the general laws of matter, night would be, or might be, eternal. On the other hand, if the sun is above the horizon, his light not extinct, and no opaque body between us and him, we believe firmly that unless a change takes place in the properties of matter, this combination of antecedents will be followed by the consequent, day; that if the combination of antecedents could be indefinitely prolonged, it would be always day; and that if the same combination had always existed, it would always have been day, quite independently of night as a previous condition. Therefore is it that we do not call night the cause, nor even a condition, of day. The existence of the sun (or some such luminous body), and there being no <b>opaque</b> <b>medium</b> in a straight line(117) between that body and the part of the earth where we are situated, are the sole conditions; and the union of these, without the addition of any superfluous circumstance, constitutes the cause. This is what writers mean when they say that the notion of cause involves the idea of necessity. If there be any meaning which confessedly belongs to the term necessity, it is unconditionalness. That which is necessary, that which must be, means that which will be, whatever supposition we may make in regard to all other things. The succession of day and night evidently is not necessary in this sense. It is conditional on the occurrence of other antecedents. That which will be followed by a given consequent when, and only when, some third circumstance also exists, is not the cause, even though no case should ever have occurred in which the phenomenon took place without it.|$|E

A one-to-one relation between the joint density of the squared radius and height of the 3 D cylinders and the joint density of the squared half-width and height of the observable 2 D rectangles is established. We propose a nonparametric estimation procedure to estimate the distributions and expectations of various quantities of interest, such as the cylinder radius, height, aspect ratio, surface area and volume from the observed 2 D rectangle widths and heights. Also, the covariance between the radius and height of a cylinder is estimated. The asymptotic behavior of these estimators is established to yield point-wise confidence intervals for the expectations and point-wise confidence sets for the distributions of the quantities of interest. Many of these quantities {{can be linked to}} the mechanical properties of the material, and are, therefore, useful for industry.

Furthermore, the processes that shape today’s galaxies were at work, and can be seen in real time with the appropriate tools.

40|$|Multiphoton quantum {{correlations}} {{are crucial}} for quantum information processing and quantum communication protocols in linear optical networks. For large-scale implementation of quantum information processing, such as quantum simulators, boson sampling or programmable quantum logic gates, a programmable functionality {{of a large}} multichannel network is required. In this thesis, we describe and demonstrate programmable quantum interference between multiple single-photon states in massively multichannel networks. Using a theoretical analysis we first show that losses in optical networks, which are unavoidable in experiments, introduce new freedom, in that the functionality of the network, and thus also quantum interference in there, is programmable to an extent not possible with lossless networks. We introduce a method to program the functionality of general multichannel linear optical networks by phase modulation of incident wavefronts, which we apply to opaque scattering media as well as integrated optics. To demonstrate quantum interference in massively multichannel networks we require a source of multiple indistinguishable single-photon states. Therefore, we have constructed and characterized a versatile quantum light source based on spontaneous parametric down-conversion. For the first time, we demonstrate two-photon quantum interference in a massively multichannel linear optical network realized in an <b>opaque</b> scattering <b>medium.</b> Using adaptive phase-modulation of the incident photons, the scattering medium is transformed to behave as a fully programmable beam splitter that is freely tunable in functionality.

Our results establish opaque scattering media as a platform for massively multichannel linear optical networks with programmable quantum correlations. Finally, the high number of available channels offered by opaque scattering media can directly be employed for authentication of secure communication. We present an authenticated protocol for quantum key distribution that removes the need of an initial shared secret for authentication. Moreover, we introduce and demonstrate the first protocol for authenticated and asymmetric quantum communication, based on the quantum-secure readout of a physical unclonable function...|$|R

Currently, abdominal ultrasound, showing highly echogenic intrabezoaric air trapping, is the diagnostic method of choice. However, identifying a gastric lactobezoar requires an investigator experienced in gastrointestinal problems of infancy as can be appreciated from the results of our review which show that in not even a single patient gastric lactobezoar was initially considered as a possible differential diagnosis. Furthermore, in over 30 % of plain radiographs reported, diagnosis was initially missed although a lactobezoar was clearly demonstrable on repeat evaluation of the same X-ray films. Enhanced diagnostic sensitivity would be most rewarding since management consisting of cessation of oral feedings combined with administration of intravenous fluids and gastric lavage is easy and resolves over 85 % of gastric lactobezoars. In conclusion, gastric lactobezoar is a disorder of unknown prevalence and is nowadays very rarely published, possibly because of inadequate diagnostic sensitivity and/or not yet identified but beneficial modifications of patient management. </p...|$|R
