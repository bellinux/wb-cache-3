5|$|During the investigation, {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts were}} made to match a knife taken from Beauchamp upon his arrest to the type of wound observed on Sharp's body. Efforts to match a footprint found near Sharp's house to Beauchamp were similarly unsuccessful. The posse that arrested Beauchamp had taken a bloody handkerchief from the crime scene, but had lost it <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> back to Frankfort after the arrest. The best evidence presented by the prosecution was the testimony of Sharp's wife Eliza that she heard the killer's voice and that it was distinctly high-pitched. When given the opportunity to hear Beauchamp's voice, she identified it as that of the killer.|$|E

30|$|Equation (4) {{is used to}} {{evaluate}} all transport operations with CO 2 emissions. <b>The</b> latter depend <b>on</b> <b>the</b> vehicle type, the average travel speed, <b>trip</b> length, and <b>the</b> load factor. Therefore, the fact is taken into account that different vehicle types are used for the different transportation flows. <b>The</b> <b>trip</b> lengths and average travel speeds are requested/derived from the data delivered by the navigation service for each trip segment run in the distribution network. Note {{that there is one}} <b>trip</b> segment for <b>the</b> line haul shipments and (n +  1) <b>trip</b> segments for <b>the</b> round <b>trips.</b> <b>The</b> load factors of the production flows and DC-consol shipments are 68 and 56  %, respectively. The load factors of the DC-direct shipments vary depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shipment size (the average is 48  %). <b>The</b> load factors <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>trips</b> connecting <b>the</b> TSPs and the reference customer are (n × tn)/(vehicle payload capacity) (on average 42  %), <b>the</b> load factors <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>trips</b> connecting <b>the</b> customers in <b>the</b> round <b>trips</b> are ((n × tn)/ 2)/(vehicle payload capacity) (on average 21  %), and <b>the</b> load factors <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>trips</b> connecting <b>the</b> reference customers and the TSPs are 0  %. Concerning <b>the</b> delivery <b>trips,</b> <b>the</b> total CO 2 emissions of a certain tour are allocated equally among all shipments that are part of this tour. This is plausible as the shipments are homogenous in terms of the distance to the transshipment point and the tonnage.|$|R

5|$|Practical {{implementations}} of road {{congestion pricing}} are found {{almost exclusively in}} urban areas, because traffic congestion is common in and around city centers. Autoroute A1 in Northern France {{is one of the}} few cases of congestion pricing implemented outside of urban areas. This is an expressway connecting Paris to Lille, and since 1992 congestion prices have been applied during weekends with the objective of spreading demand <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> back to Paris on Sunday afternoons and evenings. As congestion pricing has been increasing worldwide, the schemes implemented have been classified into four different types: cordon area around a city center; area wide congestion pricing; city center toll ring; and corridor or single facility congestion pricing.|$|E

Another trap measuring 40cm was spotted on the same day. The previous record for a N.rajah pitcher was 38cm.|$|E
5|$|Five {{weeks into}} the season, guard Howard Glenn broke his neck during a loss to the Houston Oilers, and died a few hours later, {{becoming}} the first player in professional football to die from injuries sustained on the field. New York suffered other injuries as the season progressed, and Wismer lacked the money to replace the injured players. Several players had to play both offense and defense. Wismer had arranged for the Titans to play three home games before their cross-river rivals, the Giants, started their season. This meant the Titans had to play their final three games on the road, and Wismer claimed to have lost $150,000 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip.</b> The Titans finished their first season 7–7; according to attendance figures released by the team, the Titans drew an average of 16,375fans per game. This claim was mocked by the New York press, which reported that the fans had disguised themselves as empty seats. The New York Times estimated that the team had lost $450,000 for the season; in his autobiography, Wismer set the figure at $1.2million.|$|E

Whiteside's family were Manchester United supporters, though the youngster himself held no particular allegiance.

5|$|The ice trade {{began in}} 1806 {{as the result}} of the efforts of Frederic Tudor, a New England entrepreneur, to export ice on a {{commercial}} basis. In New England, ice was an expensive product, consumed only by the wealthy who could afford their own ice houses. Nonetheless, icehouses were relatively common amongst the wealthier members of society by 1800, filled with ice cut, or harvested, from the frozen surface of ponds and streams on their local estates during the winter months. Around the neighbouring New York City area, the hot summers and rapidly growing economy had begun to increase local demand for ice towards the end of the 18th century, creating a small-scale market amongst farmers who sold ice from their ponds and streams to local city institutions and families. Some ships occasionally transported ice from New York and Philadelphia for sale to the southern U.S. states, in particular Charleston in South Carolina, laying it down as ballast <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip.</b>|$|E

Tom is able to escape and along with Nancy, they expose Sienna for everything. Sienna attacks Nancy causing her to have temporary brain damage and attempts to kill Tom, Charlie and Oscar although they are saved and Nancy recovers. Following Darren's treatment of Nancy, things are hard between them and get even worse when Nancy attempts to get revenge on Darren. However, they eventually reconcile and get engaged again.

5|$|While <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip,</b> he did {{sketch a}} line of walking wounded, and some prisoners making {{their way to the}} rear from an early morning offensive. This became the basis of the {{painting}} The Harvest of Battle which was the largest single work Nevinson painted. It was completed in February 1919 and Nevinson arranged a 'private view' of the painting in his studio on 2 April for numerous critics and journalists. Whilst this produced some favourable reviews, notably in the Daily Express, it also led to articles claiming that the painting was so grim that it was being withheld from the public. When the painting was shown at the huge The Nation's War Paintings and Drawings exhibition organised by the Imperial War Museum in December 1919 at Burlington House Nevinson was furious to find it had not been hung in the main room but rather in a side gallery. He began a campaign of vilification against all those he held responsible for this insult. Unreasonable as Nevinsons' outrage was it did have consequences; it destroyed his friendship with Muirhead Bone, who had been on the organising committee for the exhibition, made the Imperial War Museum wary of dealing with him, and blinded Nevinson himself to the high esteem in which his war paintings were held.|$|E
5|$|Willkie's {{condition}} only worsened as {{the weeks}} went on. He went to New York by rail in mid-September, but <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> he was stricken with another heart attack. Although his advisors told him to seek treatment and abandon the trip, Willkie pressed on. When he arrived in New York, Willkie was in great pain and his press secretary called an ambulance {{to take him to}} Lenox Hill Hospital. He recovered to some extent, enough so that his friends expected him to be discharged. He spent time working on the galleys of his second book, An American Program, and planned future projects. On October 4, Willkie caught a throat infection, which was treated with penicillin. As he was recovering, Willkie's now chronic heart attacks struck again and he suffered three more attacks on October 7. The hospital, which had been issuing reassuring bulletins to the public, was now forced to inform the public that Willkie's condition had worsened and that he was critically ill. The next morning, Willkie suffered one last attack which proved fatal. From the time he checked into Lenox Hill Hospital, he was said to have suffered over a dozen heart attacks.|$|E
