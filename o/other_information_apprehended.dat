40|$|Reactive systems are, generally, highly {{successful}} for dynamic uncertain domains. Analysing why {{this should be}} so indicates the main criterion for success is that <b>information</b> <b>apprehended</b> about a given situation can render it certain enough to reliably inform action. A case is made for informing action by dynamic world modelling for domains where this does not hold. When the issue of attending selectively to situational information is introduced, the case for dynamic world modelling is enhanced. A system incorporating selective perception which dynamically models its domain is described...|$|R

The study is founded on my analysis of Kalmar ports vessels records. The period that has been studied is about the second world war. The builds on two sampled months, January and May, on the years 1937, 1942, 1947 and 1956. The method that I have used is quantitative study, that will produce numbers to be presented in diagrams for analyses. My analysis forms the basis of my conclusions about the flow in port. Conclusions will be drawn with previous research and background information about the world and Kalmar. Completing the study is my didactic implement, building a teachable task regarding the <b>information</b> <b>apprehended</b> in my research. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{identifies}} 2 ̆ 2 <b>other</b> <b>information</b> 2 ̆ 2 in analysts 2 ̆ 7 forecasts as {{a legitimate}} proxy for future cash flows and examines its incremental role in explaining stock return volatility. We suggest that 2 ̆ 2 <b>other</b> <b>information</b> 2 ̆ 2 contains information about fundamentals beyond that reflected in current financial statements and reflects firms 2 ̆ 7 fundamentals on a more timely basis than dividends or earnings. Using standardized regressions, we find volatility increases when current 2 ̆ 2 <b>other</b> <b>information</b> 2 ̆ 2 is more uncertain and increases more in response to unfavorable news compared to favorable news. Variance decomposition analysis shows that the variance contribution of 2 ̆ 2 <b>other</b> <b>information</b> 2 ̆ 2 dominates that of expected-return news. The incremental role of 2 ̆ 2 <b>other</b> <b>information</b> 2 ̆ 2 is {{at least half of}} the effect of earnings in explaining future volatility. The results are more pronounced for firms with poor information environments. Overall, our results highlight the importance of including 2 ̆ 2 <b>other</b> <b>information</b> 2 ̆ 2 as an additional cash-flow proxy in future studies of stock prices and volatility...|$|R
