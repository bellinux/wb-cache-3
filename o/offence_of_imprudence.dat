6000|$|... "In {{the second}} place," [...] {{continued}} the Treasurer, [...] "we {{have found out}} that he is not visited at Barkingham. Consequently, it would be the height <b>of</b> <b>imprudence</b> to visit him here." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{stopped and}} looked at him, and then with an impulse <b>of</b> <b>imprudence</b> that only half {{concealed}} a more serious vanity, asked, [...] "Do you think I might have made a good squaw?" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{next morning}} came; and Blanche marked it as a memorable morning, by {{committing}} an act <b>of</b> <b>imprudence,</b> which struck away one {{more of the}} chances of discovery that had existed, {{before the arrival of}} the Edinburgh telegram on the previous day.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Mool's astonishment and indignation {{would have}} {{instantly}} expressed themselves, {{if he had}} not been a lawyer. As it was, his professional experience warned him <b>of</b> the <b>imprudence</b> <b>of</b> speaking too soon.|$|R
60|$|That open {{declaration}} brought the discussion to a close. It fixed Mr. Neal fast {{between the two}} alternatives of saying Yes, and committing an act <b>of</b> <b>imprudence,</b> or <b>of</b> saying No, and committing an act of inhumanity. There was a silence of some minutes. The Scotchman steadily reflected; and the German steadily watched him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, ay. I did {{not mean}} to have said {{anything}} of it, I am sure; but they did it among them,' said Mr. Edmonstone, growing ashamed, under Philip's eye, as of a dreadful piece <b>of</b> <b>imprudence.</b> 'I was out of the way at the time, but I could not refuse my consent, you know, as things stood then.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... (j) [...] "If {{there is}} no man on earth to whom your heart and {{affections}} [...] are justly due, it may savour <b>of</b> <b>imprudence,</b> but never <b>of</b> [...] criminality, to bestow that heart and those affections where you [...] please. The God of love meant and made those delicious attachments to [...] be bestowed on somebody." ...|$|R
50|$|There is no {{distinct}} <b>offence</b> <b>of</b> battery in Scotland. The <b>offence</b> <b>of</b> assault includes {{acts that}} {{could be described as}} battery.|$|R
50|$|The former <b>offences</b> <b>of</b> {{embezzlement}} {{are replaced}} by the new <b>offence</b> <b>of</b> theft, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968.|$|R
6000|$|... "As {{an adviser}} I am rather {{qualified}} {{to point out}} what should be avoided than what may be pursued, for my own life has been but a series <b>of</b> <b>imprudences</b> and conflicts <b>of</b> all descriptions. From these I have only acquired experience; if repentance were added, perhaps it might be all the better, since I do not find the former of much avail without it." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{recollection}} {{had sprung}} to her mind in a moment. She had half {{made an appointment}} with Neigh at her aunt's hotel for this very week, and here was he in Rouen to keep it. To meet him while indulging in this vagary with Lord Mountclere--which, now that the mood it had been engendered by was passing off, she somewhat regretted--would be the height <b>of</b> <b>imprudence.</b>|$|R
50|$|Section 32(1)(a) of the Theft Act 1968 did not, by {{abolishing the}} common law <b>offence</b> <b>of</b> cheating, thereby abolish {{the common law}} <b>offence</b> <b>of</b> {{conspiracy}} to defraud.|$|R
50|$|The former <b>offence</b> <b>of</b> {{fraudulent}} conversion {{was replaced by}} an <b>offence</b> <b>of</b> theft, contrary to section 1(1) of the Theft Act 1968, from which it slightly differs.|$|R
50|$|Section 2 <b>of</b> the Non-Fatal <b>Offences</b> {{against the}} Person Act 1997 creates the <b>offence</b> <b>of</b> assault, and section 3 of that Act creates the <b>offence</b> <b>of</b> assault causing harm.|$|R
5000|$|Section 13 {{abolished}} {{the common law}} <b>offences</b> <b>of</b> champerty and barratry, challenging to fight, eavesdropping or being [...] "a common scold or a common night walker." [...] It also repealed the <b>offence</b> <b>of</b> praemunire, which had survived on the statute books since 1392. It preserved the common law <b>offence</b> <b>of</b> embracery (which was later abolished by the Bribery Act 2010).|$|R
50|$|By its Law Reform (Abolitions & Repeals) Act 1996, the Australian Capital Territory {{abolished}} {{the common law}} <b>offence</b> <b>of</b> blasphemous libel. The common law <b>offence</b> <b>of</b> blasphemy may yet exist.|$|R
50|$|This section replaces section 4 of the Prevention <b>of</b> <b>Offences</b> Act 1851 (14 & 15 Vict c 19). The <b>offence</b> <b>of</b> {{wounding}} {{either with}} or without a weapon or instrument under this section replaces the <b>offence</b> <b>of</b> stabbing, cutting or wounding under that section.|$|R

50|$|Two new characters, a brother-sister pairing, {{do much to}} set {{in motion}} the (unfinished) plot. Isabella Stanley (a forerunner of Northanger Abbey's Isabella Thorpe) bonds with Catherine over sentimental novels; while their {{friendship}} also opens a conduct book debate over female correspondence: Isabella's mother maintains that “Nothing forms the taste more than sensible & Elegant letters”, while Catherine's aunt objects to “a correspondence between Girls as...the frequent origin <b>of</b> <b>imprudence</b> & Error”.|$|R
5000|$|Iranian Foreign Ministry {{summoned the}} Saudi Arabian chargé d'affaires. Foreign Ministry Spokesman Hossein Jaberi Ansari said the {{execution}} of Sheikh Nimr [...] "who had no means other than speech to pursue his political and religious objectives only shows the depth <b>of</b> <b>imprudence</b> and irresponsibility". He said that the Saudi government [...] "supports terrorist movements and extremists, but confronts domestic critics with oppression and execution". Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif also condemned the execution.|$|R
50|$|The {{above are}} {{sometimes}} called partial defences to murder, {{since they do}} not excuse the offender from the <b>offence</b> <b>of</b> murder entirely but merely reduce it to the <b>offence</b> <b>of</b> culpable homicide not amounting to murder.|$|R
60|$|As to crimes, too, I {{would draw}} a strong line of limitation. For no one offence, {{politically}} an <b>offence</b> <b>of</b> rebellion, by council, contrivance, persuasion, or compulsion, for none properly a military <b>offence</b> <b>of</b> rebellion, or anything done by open hostility in the field, should any man at all {{be called in}} question; because such {{seems to be the}} proper and natural death of civil dissensions. The <b>offences</b> <b>of</b> war are obliterated by peace.|$|R

50|$|In 1985, the Law Commission (England and Wales) {{published}} a report, Criminal Law: Offences against Religious and Public Worship, that {{concluded that the}} common law <b>offences</b> <b>of</b> blasphemy and blasphemous libel should be abolished without replacement. In England and Wales, the common law <b>offence</b> <b>of</b> blasphemous libel was abolished on 8 July 2008 by the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008. The Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006 created an <b>offence</b> <b>of</b> inciting hatred against a person {{on the grounds of}} their religion.|$|R
50|$|The UK has no {{specific}} ban on taking such photos.

40|$|The <b>offence</b> <b>of</b> {{intoxication}} - article § 360 of {{the criminal}} code Resumé This final thesis deals with the <b>offence</b> <b>of</b> intoxication, possible approaches on to how to punish such offenders whose insanity causes their intoxication. This thesis points {{out some of the}} difficulties that could occur while interpreting and applying the law, and is trying to suggest a solution that better corresponds with modern legislation and legal principles. The <b>offence</b> <b>of</b> intoxication - article § 360 of the Criminal Code is actually a special offence based on a construction of the facts of the case, concept of Rauschdelikt. It was restored into our Criminal Code with the amendment of an Act in 1991, which replaced the previous full criminal liability of individuals who caused their insanity voluntarily. The <b>offence</b> <b>of</b> intoxication is an important criminal law theory for its attitude to a "liability for fault" principle, which the criminal <b>offence</b> <b>of</b> intoxication "breaks through" and extends conditions of criminal liability itself. Insanity is generally considered a condition that relieves the perpetrator of criminal liability, but not in the case <b>of</b> the <b>offence</b> <b>of</b> intoxication.
