50|$|More specifically, let us {{consider}} a subarray of W channels, where W<<N, which slides over the input data as shown in Fig. 1. For every subarray position an optimum multichannel filter based on (9) can be designed so that the undesired interferences are suppressed from its corresponding output trace. It {{should be noted that}} in designing this filter we use W instead of N in expression (9). thus traces 1,2,...,W of the input record produce the first trace of the <b>output</b> <b>record,</b> traces K,K+1,...K+W-1 of the input record produce the Kth trace of the <b>output</b> <b>record,</b> and traces N-W+1,N-W+2,...,N of the input record produce the (N-W+1)st trace, which is the last trace, of the <b>output</b> <b>record.</b> For a large N and small W, as is typically the case in geophysical data, the <b>output</b> <b>record</b> can be viewed as comparable in dimensions to the input record. Clearly for such a scheme to work effectively W must be as small as possible; {{while at the same time}} it must be large enough to provide the necessary attenuation of the undesired signals.Note that a maximum of W-1 undesired interferences can be totally suppressed by such a scheme.|$|E

Lisco produced over 574 kn of finished {{products in the}} first half of 2005, increasing 65% over the first half of 2004. The company also increased liquid steel production 52%. Rebar was 57.3% of finished products, hot-rolled coils was 39.3%. Sponge iron production was 579.407 tons, 348.243 tons of HBI, 376.239 tons of billets and blooms and 281.832 tons of slabs. During the first nine months of 2005, Lisco reached its highest production ever; 1 million tons of liquid steel. This was confirmed by Secretary of the Popular Committee, Dr. Mohammad Abu Ojeila Al-Mabrouk at celebrations in September 2005 on the occasion of the passage of 15 years since the company’s mills began production, which concurs with the anniversary of the Al-Fatah Revolution in Libya. In 2005, Lisco achieved the highest rate of increase in steel production among Arab companies, which amounted to 34.8%. Its production increased by 65% in the period from January to June 2005 compared with the same period of 2004. Production of both long and flat products was 1.070 tons in 2006. Flat products achieved a new <b>output</b> <b>record</b> for the company of 564kt, 13% higher than 2005. Production of bars and rods was 26% lower than 2005. Long product sales were 642 kn in 2006, a sizeable increase from 634 kn in 2005, forcing the company to import 168 kn of long products, mostly from Ukraine.|$|E
5000|$|In January of 1978, Doman {{returned}} to Connecticut as Chief Systems Engineer {{of the wind}} energy program at Hamilton Standard division of United Technologies. [...] Drawing on Doman’s extensive knowledge of rotor dynamics for both helicopters and wind turbines, United Technologies designed and built two of the largest wind turbines ever built {{up to that time}} (i.e. WTS-3, WTS-4). [...] Key features of those turbines, in addition to their size, were the use of only two blades (instead of three, which is more common) and the mounting of the blades on a teeter hinge hub. [...] This was analogous to Doman’s use of the gimbaled hub on his helicopters, which had 4-bladed rotors. [...] One turbine (WTS-4) was installed and successfully tested at Medicine Bow, Wyoming, and the other (WTS-3) in Sweden. [...] The WTS-4 wind turbine held the world power <b>output</b> <b>record</b> for over 20 years. [...] Throughout all the research studies and the testing of the actual turbines, there was rapid evolution in Doman’s thinking on the best design concepts. [...] However, when oil prices plummeted in the mid-1980s, United Technologies deemed the wind energy market to be uneconomical and halted the program.The Italian government took notice of Doman’s work, and in July of 1987, when Doman retired from United Technologies, he was hired by Aeritalia (the Italian manufacturer later known as Alenia) and moved to Rome to head Italy’s wind energy program. [...] In this program, Doman applied his latest thinking to a new machine, considerably improved over the WTS-4 and WTS-3 machines he had designed for installation in Wyoming and Sweden respectively. [...] Under Doman’s leadership a team of Italian engineers designed the Gamma 60 turbine. [...] The Gamma 60 was the world's first variable speed wind turbine with a teeter hinge. [...] Three Gamma 60 turbines were manufactured, and one was erected and successfully tested for 4 years on the Mediterranean island of Sardinia. [...] There had been intentions to build many more Gamma 60 turbines, but Italian politics and a lack of urgency due to relatively low oil prices in the 1990s resulted in the program being cancelled.|$|E
