40|$|Complete {{androgen}} insensitivity {{syndrome is}} an X-linked inherited disorder caused by mutations in the androgen receptor (AR) gene. Using {{polymerase chain reaction}} single-strand DNA conformational polymorphism and DNA sequencing, we identified a novel nonsense mutation in exon 1 of the AR gene in 2 Iranian brothers with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome. Despite a normal 46,XY karyotype, testes, and normal to elevated plasma levels of testosterone, they were born with female external genitalia and phenotype. This new mutation, a T-to-A transversion in exon 1, causes amino acid change of tyrosine (TAT) to <b>ochre</b> <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> (TAA) at position 514 of the AR polypeptide. The Y 514 X mutation {{is located in a}} region that is normally important for the formation and function of the hormone receptor complex. We conclude that the novel Y 514 X mutation in the androgen receptor is the cause of complete androgen insensitivity syndrome in this family...|$|E
40|$|Mitotic gene conversions, {{among other}} recombinagenic events, {{can play an}} {{important}} role in the multistep process of carcinogenesis. The ability of chemicals to induce such gene conversions can easily be monitored in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae tester strain YHE 2, a derivative of strain D 7. For the detection of drug-induced gene conversions, two mutations in the TRP 5 locus are used, trp 5 - 12 and trp 5 - 27. Here we report on the characterization of the stable allele trp 5 - 27. Our analysis revealed two relevant mutations in trp 5 - 27 : (a) a transition C to T at position 121 after ATG that results in an amber stop codon and abolishes gene expression and (b) a transversion A to T at position 1555 that creates an <b>ochre</b> <b>stop</b> <b>codon.</b> Simultaneous amber and ochre suppression with the suppressors SUP 3 and SUP 11, respectively, was capable of relieving the tryptophan-requiring phenotype of strains carrying the trp 5 - 27 allele. These findings have implications on the length of gene conversion tracts in conversion events between trp 5 - 12 and trp 5 - 27 : conversion tracts can cover several kilobases, if the site of the mutation in trp 5 - 12 lies outside of the positions mutated in trp 5 - 27. Conversely, the maximal length is limited to 1435 bp, if the mutation in trp 5 - 12 is located between the positions mutated in trp 5 - 2...|$|E
40|$|Two {{efficient}} {{systems have}} been used for high-level expression of Lactobacillus casei dihydrofolate reductase in Escherichia coli, including the production of protein generally and specifically labeled with 13 C and 15 N. A system based on T 7 RNA polymerase led to the production of dihydrofolate reductase at a level of 37 % of the total soluble protein of the host strain: 50 mg of pure enzyme was obtained from a 1 liter of culture (or 14 mg/g wet weight of cells). In this system, a small amount of the enzyme (less than 5 %) was identified as a catalytically active 21 -kDa fusion protein. Introduction of a second in-frame (<b>ochre)</b> <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> did not eliminate the production of this fusion protein. The same expression system was also used to prepare dihydrofolate reductase generally labeled with 15 N and to prepare single and double mutants of the enzyme. In order to have an expression system which can be used with a range of auxotrophic strains of E. coli, a system based on the tac promoter was used. This led to the production of dihydrofolate reductase at a level of 29 % of total soluble protein; a yield of 40 mg enzyme per liter of culture (or 11 mg/g wet weight of cells). This system was successfully used to produce mutants of the enzyme as well as the enzyme selectively labeled with [gamma- 13 C]aspartic acid. 7648...|$|E

40|$|Translational {{attenuation}} {{has been}} proposed to be the mechanism by which the erm(B) gene is induced. Here, we report genetic and biochemical evidence, obtained by using erythromycin as the inducing antibiotic, that supports this hypothesis. We also show that erythromycin increases {{the level of the}} erm(B) transcript by stalling the ribosome on the leader mRNA and thereby facilitating the stabilization and processing of the mRNA. Erythromycin-induced mRNA stabilization and processing were observed with an <b>ochre</b> <b>stop</b> at <b>codons</b> 11 to 13 of the leader but not with an <b>ochre</b> <b>stop</b> at <b>codon</b> 10. This suggests that erythromycin does not stall the ribosome before codon 11 of the leader reaches the aminoacyl site. Secondary structure analyses of the erm(B) transcripts by in vitro and in vivo chemical probing techniques identified conformational changes in the transcripts that result from induction by erythromycin. These findings demonstrate that stalling of erythromycin-bound ribosomes at leader codon 11 causes the refolding of mRNA into a conformation in which the translational initiation site for the structural gene is unmasked and renders erm(B) translationally active...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of the tRNA ochre suppressors SUP 11 and SUP 5 is found to induce meiosis I nondisjunction in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The induction increases with increasing dosage of the suppressor and decreases in the {{presence of}} an antisuppressor. The effect is independent of the chromosomal location of SUP 11. Each of five different chromosomes monitored exhibited nondisjunction at frequencies of 0. 1 %- 1. 1 % of random spores, which is a 16 - 160 -fold increase over wild-type levels. Increased nondisjunction is reflected by a marked increase in tetrads with two and zero viable spores. In the case of chromosome III, for which a 50 -cM map interval was monitored, the resulting disomes are all in the parental nonrecombinant configuration. Recombination along chromosome III appears normal both in meioses that have no nondisjunction and in meioses for which there was nondisjunction of another chromosome. We propose that a proportion of one or more proteins involved in chromosome pairing, recombination or segregation are aberrant due to translational read-through of the normal <b>ochre</b> <b>stop</b> <b>codon.</b> Hygromycin B, an antibiotic that can suppress nonsense mutations via translational read-through, also induces nonrecombinant meiosis I nondisjunction. Increases in mistranslation, therefore, increase the production of aneuploids during meiosis.

40|$|Antibodies induced against {{mammalian}} single-stranded DNA binding protein (ssDBP) UP I {{were shown}} to be cross-reactive {{with most of the}} basic hnRNP core proteins, the main constituents of 40 S hnRNP particles. This suggested a structural relationship between both groups of proteins. Using the anti-ssDBP antibodies, a cDNA clone (pRP 10) was isolated from a human liver cDNA library in plasmid expression vector pEX 1. By DNA sequencing this clone was shown to encode in its 949 bp insert the last 72 carboxy terminal amino acids of the ssDBP UP I. Thereafter, an open reading frame continued for another 124 amino acids followed by a UAA (<b>ochre)</b> <b>stop</b> <b>codon.</b> Direct amino acid sequencing of a V 8 protease peptide from hnRNP core protein A 1 showed that this peptide contained at its amino terminus the last 11 amino acids of UP I followed by 19 amino acids which are encoded by the open reading frame of cDNA clone pRP 10 immediately following the UP I sequence. This proves that ssDBP UP I arises by proteolysis from hnRNP core protein A 1. This finding must lead to a re-evaluation of the possible physiological role of UP I and related ssDBPs. The formerly assumed function in DNA replication, although not completely ruled out, should be reconsidered in the light of a possible alternative or complementary function in hnRNA processing where UP I could either be a simple degradation product of core protein A 1 (as a consequence of controlling the levels of active A 1) or may continue to function as an RNA binding protein which has lost the ability to interact with the other core proteins.

40|$|Six sap-transmitted viruses were {{identified}} during {{a study of}} 434 flowering cherry trees (Prunus serrulata Lindl. sensu lato) in the North Island of New Zealand. These included Prunus necrotic ringspot ilarvirus strain G (PNRSV -G), apple mosaic ilarvirus (ApMV), flowering cherry virus B (FCVB), strawberry latent ringspot virus (SLRV), prune dwarf ilarvirus (PDV) and flowering cherry virus I (FCVI). Of these, ApMV, FCVB, SLRV and FCVI were new records for this host. FCVB and FCVI are newly described viruses. The most common virus was PNRSV -G (30. 6 %); the other viruses ranged in incidence from 1 0. 2 % (FCVB) to 0. 5 % (PDV). A further nine viruses were also detected by mechanical transmission, but were not characterized in this study. Repeated sampling of 30 flowering cherry trees during late winter and early spring showed that ELISA was more sensitive for detecting PNRSV -G infection of flowering cherries than sap-transmission. Three methods for purifying PNRSV -G isolates from flowering cherry were assessed and the best method was one that used ether as a clarification agent. Yields of 5. 0 mg/ 1 00 g of tissue were obtained. An antiserum was produced to PNRSV-G in New Zealand white rabbits which had a titre in microprecipitin tests of 1 / 81 92. A 338 nucleotide cDNA clone was made to PNRSV-G which hybridised to RNA- 3 in Northern analysis. FCVI had a narrow host range, quasi-isometric particles of c. 26 nm diam. morphologically similar to the particles of ilarviruses, some bullet shaped particles (also characteristic of ilarviruses), four RNA species of 3550, 2800, 2000 and 1 050 nucleotides, and a coat protein of Mr 30 000. These properties indicate that FCVI has affinities with the ilarvirus group, but it differs in host range and symptoms, physical characteristics and serological properties from other members of this group. FCVB infected both monocotyledons and dicotyledons, but had a limited host range. FCVB has four RNA species of 3900, 21 50, 1 800 and 800 nucleotides (estimated from denatured dsRNA). Partially purified preparations contained isometric particles about 24 nm in diameter. When purified at pH 7. 5 FCVB sedimented in sucrose gradients as three UV absorbing components and virus particles appeared to be swollen. At low pH (5. 0 or 6. 0) or at pH 7. 5 {{with the addition of}} magnesium ions, FCVB sedimented as a single predominant UV absorbing component and virus particles were not swollen. One major protein band (Mr 1 9 300) was extracted from partially purified preparations. Based on these features, it is proposed that FCVB is a new member of the bromovirus group. However, serological interrelationships were not detected with antisera to three bromoviruses, brome mosaic virus, broad bean mottle virus and cowpea chlorotic mottle virus. SLRV was isolated from flowering cherry trees in close proximity to each other in Auckland, New Zealand. The virus was not isolated from any of 390 flowering cherry trees tested from four other regions in the North Island. The virus was identified by host range, particle morphology, RNA and protein content and by serology. This is the first record of SLRV in flowering cherry. The nucleotide sequence of the 3 ' -terminal 2427 nucleotides of SLRV RNA- 2 were determined using cDNA clones. The sequence contains a single reading frame terminating at an <b>ochre</b> <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> 552 nucleotides from a 3 '-terminal poly(A) tract. The N-terminal sequences of the two SLRV coat proteins determined by Edman degradation indicated that the larger 43 K protein had a N-terminal Gly and the smaller 27 K protein was cleaved at a Ser/Gly bond. No homologies were found in amino acid sequences or nucleotide sequences to four comoviruses or six nepoviruses suggesting that SLRV should be placed in a separate plant virus group...|$|E
40|$|Elongator {{has been}} {{reported}} to be a histone acetyltransferase complex involved in elongation of RNA polymerase II transcription. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mutations in any of the six Elongator protein subunit (ELP 1 –ELP 6) genes or the three killer toxin insensitivity (KTI 11 –KTI 13) genes cause similar pleiotropic phenotypes. By analyzing modified nucleosides in individual tRNA species, we show that the ELP 1 –ELP 6 and KTI 11 –KTI 13 genes are all required for an early step in synthesis of 5 -methoxycarbonylmethyl (mcm 5) and 5 -carbamoylmethyl (ncm 5) groups present on uridines at the wobble position in tRNA. Transfer RNA immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the Elp 1 and Elp 3 proteins specifically coprecipitate a tRNA susceptible to formation of an mcm 5 side chain, indicating a direct role of Elongator in tRNA modification. The presence of mcm 5 U, ncm 5 U, or derivatives thereof at the wobble position is required for accurate and efficient translation, suggesting that the phenotypes of elp 1 –elp 6 and kti 11 –kti 13 mutants could be caused by a translational defect. Accordingly, a deletion of any ELP 1 –ELP 6 or KTI 11 –KTI 13 gene prevents an ochre suppressor tRNA that normally contains mcm 5 U from reading <b>ochre</b> <b>stop</b> <b>codons...</b>|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} reported {{the construction of}} a food-grade cloning vector for Lactococcus using the ochre suppressor, supB, as the selective marker. This vector, pFG 1, causes only a slight growth inhibition in the laboratory strain MG 1363 but is unstable in the industrial strains tested. As supB suppresses both amber and <b>ochre</b> <b>stop</b> <b>codons,</b> which are present in 82 % of all known lactococcal genes, this undesirable finding may result from the accumulation of elongated mistranslated polypeptides.

The vector uses an amber suppressor, supD, as selectable marker and consists entirely of Lactococcus DNA, with the exception of a small polylinker region. Using suppressible pyrimidine auxotrophs, selection and maintenance are efficient in any pyrimidine-free medium including milk. Importantly, the presence of this vector in a variety of industrial strains has no significant effect on the growth rate or the rate of acidification in milk, making this an ideal system for food-grade modification of industrially relevant L. lactis strains.

40|$|The genomic RNA of an alphavirus encodes four {{different}} nonstructural proteins, nsP 1, nsP 2, nsP 3, and nsP 4. The polyprotein P 123 is produced when translation terminates at an opal termination codon between nsP 3 and nsP 4. The polyprotein P 1234 is produced when translational readthrough occurs {{or when the}} opal termination codon {{has been replaced by}} a sense codon in the alphavirus genome. Evolutionary pressures appear to have maintained genomic sequences encoding both a <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> (opal) and an open reading frame (arginine) as a general feature of the O'nyong-nyong virus (ONNV) genome, indicating that both are required at some point. Alternate replication of ONNVs in both vertebrate and invertebrate hosts may determine predominance of a particular codon at this locus in the viral quasispecies. However, no systematic study has previously tested this hypothesis in whole animals. We report here the results of the first study to investigate in a natural mosquito host the functional significance of the opal <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> in an alphavirus genome. We used a full-length cDNA clone of ONNV to construct a series of mutants in which the arginine between nsP 3 and nsP 4 was replaced with an opal, <b>ochre,</b> or amber <b>stop</b> <b>codon.</b> The presence of an opal <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> upstream of nsP 4 nearly doubled (75. 5 %) the infectivity of ONNV over that of virus possessing a codon for the amino acid arginine at the corresponding position (39. 8 %). Although the frequency with which the opal virus disseminated from the mosquito midgut did not differ significantly from that of the arginine virus on days 8 and 10, dissemination did began earlier in mosquitoes infected with the opal virus. Although a clear fitness advantage is provided to ONNV by the presence of an opal codon between nsP 3 and nsP 4 in Anopheles gambiae, sequence analysis of ONNV RNA extracted from mosquito bodies and heads indicated codon usage at this position corresponded with that of the virus administered in the blood meal. These results suggest that while selection of ONNV variants is occurring, de novo mutation at the position between nsP 3 and nsP 4 does not readily occur in the mosquito. Taken together, these results suggest that the primary fitness advantage provided to ONNV by the presence of an opal codon between nsP 3 and nsP 4 is related to mosquito infectivity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract De novo {{origin of}} coding {{sequence}} remains an obscure issue in molecular evolution. One {{of the possible}} paths for addition (subtraction) of DNA segments to (from) a gene is <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> shift.

Results In the human genome, codons readily mutable to stops are underrepresented in coding sequences.

Evolutionary events in which <b>stop</b> <b>codons</b> are lost {{preserve}} the reading frame much more often than would be expected from mutation bias.

Later, it was demonstrated that different release factors recognize different <b>stop</b> <b>codons.</b>|$|R
40|$|The soybean SIRE 1 {{family of}} Ty 1 /copia retrotransposons encodes an envelope-like gene (env-like). We {{analysed}} the DNA sequences of nine SIRE 1 insertions and {{observed that the}} gag/pol and env-like genes {{are in the same}} reading frame and separated by a single UAG <b>stop</b> <b>codon.</b> The six nucleotides immediately downstream of the <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> conform to a degenerate nucleotide motif, CARYYA, which is sufficient to facilitate <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> suppression in tobacco mosaic virus. In vivo <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> suppression assays indicate that SIRE 1 sequences confer leakiness to the UAG <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> at an efficiency of 5 %. These data suggest that SIRE 1 retro-elements use translational suppression to express their envelope-like protein; this is in contrast with all characterized retroviruses, which express the envelope protein from a spliced genomic messenger RNA...|$|R
40|$|<b>Stop</b> <b>codon</b> {{recognition}} {{is a crucial}} event during translation termination and is performed by class I release factors (RF 1 and RF 2 in bacterial cells). Recent crystal structures showed that <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> {{recognition is}} achieved mainly through a network of hydrogen bonds and stacking interactions between the <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> and conserved residues in domain II of RF 1 /RF 2. Additionally, previous studies suggested that recognition of <b>stop</b> <b>codons</b> is coupled to proper positioning of RF 1 on the ribosome, which is essential for triggering peptide release. In this study we mutated four conserved residues in Escherichia coli RF 1 (Gln 185, Arg 186, Thr 190, and Thr 198) that are proposed to be critical for discriminating <b>stop</b> <b>codons</b> from sense codons. Our thermodynamic and kinetic analysis of these RF 1 mutants showed that the mutations inhibited the binding of RF 1 to the ribosome. However, the mutations in RF 1 {{did not affect the}} rate of peptide release, showing that imperfect recognition of the <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> does not affect the proper positioning of RF 1 on the ribosome...|$|R
5000|$|The mRNA {{sequence}} of C10orf71 has 3 exons and 10 <b>stop</b> <b>codons</b> in the favorable splice form., The two alternative splice forms had 47 and 75 <b>stop</b> <b>codons</b> interspersed throughout the sequence {{so they were}} not utilized to obtain further sequence information. The main splice form that was analyzed had the ten <b>stop</b> <b>codons</b> interspersed throughout the 5' and 3' UTR, which was why this splice form was utilized to further analyze (refer to Table 1 for details of <b>stop</b> <b>codons</b> and exons).

40|$|The trpB and trpA coding {{regions of}} the {{polycistronic}} trp mRNA of Escherichia coli are separated by overlapping translation <b>stop</b> and start <b>codons.</b> Efficient translation of the trp A coding region is subject to translational coupling, i. e., maximal trpA expression is dependent on prior translation of the trpB coding region (1, 2). Previous studies demonstrated that the trpA Shine-Dalgarno sequence (within trpB) and/or {{the location of the}} trpB <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> influenced trpA expression (2). To examine the effect of <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> location specifically, we constructed plasmids in which different nucleotide sequences preceding the trp A start codon were retained, and only the reading frame was changed. When trpB translation proceeded in the wild type reading frame and terminated at the normal trpB <b>stop</b> <b>codon,</b> trpA polypeptide levels were elevated over the levels observed when translation stopped before or after the natural trpB <b>stop</b> <b>codon.</b> The proximity of the trpB <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> to the trpA start codon therefore markedly influences trpA expression...|$|R
40|$|Eukaryote ribosomal {{translation}} is terminated when release factor eRF 1, {{in a complex}} with eRF 3, binds {{to one of the}} three <b>stop</b> <b>codons.</b> The tertiary structure and dimensions of eRF 1 are similar to that of a tRNA, supporting the hypothesis that release factors may act as molecular mimics of tRNAs. To identify the yeast eRF 1 <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> recognition domain (analogous to a tRNA anticodon), a genetic screen was performed to select for mutants with disabled recognition of only one of the three <b>stop</b> <b>codons.</b> Nine out of ten mutations isolated map to conserved residues within the eRF 1 N-terminal domain 1. A subset of these mutants, although wild-type for ribosome and eRF 3 interaction, differ in their respective abilities to recognize each of the three <b>stop</b> <b>codons,</b> indicating codon-specific discrimination defects. Five of six of these stop codon-specific mutants define yeast domain 1 residues (I 32, M 48, V 68, L 123, and H 129) that locate at three pockets on the eRF 1 domain 1 molecular surface into which a <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> can be modeled. The genetic screen results and the mutant phenotypes are therefore consistent with a role for domain 1 in <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> recognition; the topology of this eRF 1 domain, together with eRF 1 -stop codon complex modeling further supports the proposal that this domain may represent the site of <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> binding itself...|$|R
50|$|Nonsense {{suppressor}} is {{a useful}} genetic tool, but can also result in problematic side effects, since all identical <b>stop</b> <b>codons</b> in the genome will also be suppressed to the same degree. Genes with different or multiple <b>stop</b> <b>codons</b> will be unaffected.|$|R
50|$|A {{nonsense}} mutation in the leptin gene {{that results in}} a <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> and lack of leptin production was first observed in mice in 1950. In the mouse gene, arginine-105 is encoded by CGA and only requires one nucleotide change to create the <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> TGA. The corresponding amino acid in humans is encoded by the sequence CGG and would require two nucleotides to be changed to produce a <b>stop</b> <b>codon,</b> which is {{much less likely to}} happen.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{propose that}} the amino acid {{residues}} 57 / 58 and 60 / 61 of eukaryotic release factors (eRF 1 s) (counted from the N-terminal Met of human eRF 1) are responsible for <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> recognition in protein synthesis. The proposal is based on amino acid exchanges in these positions in the eRF 1 s of two ciliates that reassigned one or two <b>stop</b> <b>codons</b> to sense codons in evolution and on the crystal structure of human eRF 1. The proposed mechanism of <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> recognition assumes that the amino acid residues 57 / 58 interact with the second and the residues 60 / 61 with the third position of a <b>stop</b> <b>codon.</b> The fact that conventional eRF 1 s recognize all three <b>stop</b> <b>codons</b> but not the codon for tryptophan is attributed to {{the flexibility of the}} helix containing these residues. We suggest that the helix is able to assume a partly relaxed or tight conformation depending on the <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> recognized. The restricted codon recognition observed in organisms with unconventional eRF 1 s is attributed mainly to the loss of flexibility of the helix due to exchanged amino acids...|$|R
