5|$|The account starts briskly; {{only four}} pages {{are devoted to}} Ralph's early life and a further {{fourteen}} to his voyage to the Pacific Ocean on board the Arrow. He and his two companions– 18-year-old Jack Martin and 13-year-old Peterkin Gay– are the sole survivors of the shipwreck. The narrative is in two parts. The first describes how the boys feed themselves, what they drink, the clothing and shelter they fashion, and how they cope with having to rely on their <b>own</b> <b>resources.</b> The {{second half of the}} novel is more action-packed, featuring conflicts with pirates, fighting between the native Polynesians, and the conversion efforts of Christian missionaries.|$|E
5|$|After Egypt's central {{government}} collapsed {{at the end}} of the Old Kingdom, the administration could no longer support or stabilize the country's economy. Regional governors could not rely on the king for help in times of crisis, and the ensuing food shortages and political disputes escalated into famines and small-scale civil wars. Yet despite difficult problems, local leaders, owing no tribute to the pharaoh, used their new-found independence to establish a thriving culture in the provinces. Once in control of their <b>own</b> <b>resources,</b> the provinces became economically richer—which was demonstrated by larger and better burials among all social classes. In bursts of creativity, provincial artisans adopted and adapted cultural motifs formerly restricted to the royalty of the Old Kingdom, and scribes developed literary styles that expressed the optimism and originality of the period.|$|E

By the financial year ending March 1962 it reported a group net profit of £575,352 and a dividend of 22.5%.

Fixed assets had increased significantly: the business had taken over Newcast Foundries Ltd, Halifax-based heavy lathe manufacturer Denhams Engineering Co Ltd and Churchill-Milnes; it had spent £2M of its <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> building extensions and plant improvements to more than double its manufacturing capability compared to that in 1951.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the organization of}} the village society in Benestad, in southern Sweden, during the period from 1886 to 1928. The study focuses on the commonly <b>owned</b> <b>resources</b> in the village and how the landowners there came together and shared the resources. By studying the records of the societies’ meetings, and in particular the cases that concerns the common resources, a categorization has been done.   The results of the study show that the landowners in Benestad shared pasture lands, milk carriage and other resources with one another. Overall, the village society had a strong organization with at least two yearly meetings about the commonly <b>owned</b> <b>resources.</b> Not everyone was however welcomed to the meetings and the wives and children had to trust their housemaster to also consider their interests. By comparing the results with Elinor Ostrom’s theory of eight design principles that unites all stabile institutions that handle commonly <b>owned</b> <b>resources,</b> one can say that the village society in Benestad was a stabile establishment. In fact, the society is still active - even if the landowners nowadays deal with other matters than those of the milk carriage. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the competitiveness of}} cereal production in selected EU member states, during the period 1996 2000. Profitability was selected {{as a measure of}} competitive performance and costs of production, value of output and partial productivity indicators were examined as possible sources (potential) of competitive performance. Using data from the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) the analysis showed that productivity levels in the UK, Ireland and France were consistently higher then competing countries Denmark, Germany and Italy. In terms of profitability, the opportunity cost of <b>owned</b> <b>resources</b> had a major impact on the competitiveness of cereal production within the EU. Cash costs as a percentage of total output were lowest in Italy but in terms of total economic costs, including an opportunity cost for all <b>owned</b> <b>resources,</b> Italy had the highest cost structure amongst the countries examine. These findings have implications for EU cereal producers in the medium term as direct payments are decoupled from production and producers must make production decisions based on full economic costs of production, including adequate remuneration for <b>owned</b> <b>resources.</b> competitiveness, cereal production, profitability, competitive performance, competitive potential, Production Economics, Q 12,...|$|R

He re-enlisted some of his troops and recruited additional men to join him. Hamilton waited for spring to begin a campaign to retake the forts at Kaskaskia and Cahokia, but Clark planned another surprise attack on Fork Sackville at Vincennes. He left Kaskaskia on February 6, 1779 with about 170 men, beginning an arduous overland trek, encountering melting snow, ice, and cold rain along the journey. They arrived at Vincennes on February 23 and launched a surprise attack on Fort Sackville. Hamilton surrendered the garrison on February 25 and was captured in the process. The winter expedition was Clark's most significant military achievement and became {{the basis of his}} reputation as an early American military hero.|$|E
5|$|Trans Polar made a {{demonstration}} trip to Stockholm on 13 June 1970—legal {{because it was}} without paying customers. The airline applied for permission to operate out of Sweden, but this {{was rejected by the}} Swedish Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) and appeals were rejected by the Ministry of Enterprise, Energy and Communications. The reason was that it lacked a permanent organization, did not have sufficient experience in large-scale charter operations and could not document that its charter operations would be based on their <b>own</b> <b>resources.</b> Despite the lack of permission, Trans Polar sub-chartered a round trip from Stockholm to London on 28 June. It then operated four flights from Stockholm to Rhodes, Palma de Mallorca and London between 4 and 6 July. Trans Polar claimed that they were flying courtesy trips and that the passengers had agreed to be compensated the part of the package trip which would have been paid to Trans Polar. The arguments were rejected by the CAA, who stated that this was a typical post-excuse and that in case of a courtesy trip the airline should not be collecting the fare in the first place. The incident was investigated by both Norwegian and Swedish police.|$|E
5|$|White {{departed}} {{his home}} in Romney for Charleston, West Virginia, where he was entirely dependent upon himself and his <b>own</b> <b>resources.</b> There, White commenced his career in public service in 1886 when he began serving as a messenger {{in the office of}} West Virginia Secretary of State Henry S. Walker. He received successive promotions within the Secretary of State's office beginning with clerk, then to stationery clerk, and finally to chief clerk of the office during the latter part of Walker's term in office. White was retained as the chief clerk of the office by Walker's successor, William A. Ohley. White was affiliated with the Secretary of State's office for seven years. He continued to fulfill that position until March 8, 1893, when he was appointed to serve as the private secretary to West Virginia Governor William A. MacCorkle. As a representative of Governor MacCorkle, White traveled across the state to high-profile events, such as the June 1895 strikes at the Crozier Works on Elkhorn Creek in McDowell County, to urge calm and to provide the governor with situational awareness on the strike. White performed as Governor MacCorkle's private secretary for four years until the end of his administration's term in 1897.|$|E

25|$|By simply {{observing the}} stem of one H. physophora individual, we see the complex {{interactions}} between four different species: an ant, a plant, a fungus, and an assassin bug, {{as well as all}} of the prey that lands on the plant. The plant gives a little of its <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> to the predators, but it gets two forms of defense against herbivores and parasitic plants. To the plant, this defense is worth much more than the loss of some food. The plant has maximized its own fitness by establishing two separate and independent relationships that are not very costly but very rewarding. The insects both benefit as well, given a safe habitat and a steady food supply of other insects that land on the prey. In the perspective of A. decemarticulatus, they do not actively give any of their <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> to the plant or to the assassin bug. They simply live among them, use their resources, and hunt.|$|E
