5|$|The {{request for}} a sequel {{prompted}} Tolkien to begin what would become his most famous work: the epic novel The Lord <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rings</b> (originally published in three volumes 1954–1955). Tolkien spent {{more than ten years}} writing the primary narrative and appendices for The Lord <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rings,</b> during which time he received the constant support of the Inklings, in particular his closest friend C.S.Lewis, the author of The Chronicles of Narnia. Both The Hobbit and The Lord <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rings</b> are set against the background of The Silmarillion, but in a time long after it.|$|E

Long after completing The Lord <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rings,</b> Tolkien would write that of all characters Faramir resembles the author most, and that he had deliberately bestowed upon the character several traits of his own.|$|E

5|$|Tolkien {{at first}} {{intended}} The Lord <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rings</b> to be a children's tale {{in the style}} of The Hobbit, but it quickly grew darker and more serious in the writing.

Tolkien's influence weighs heavily on the fantasy genre that grew up after the success of The Lord <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rings.</b>|$|E
