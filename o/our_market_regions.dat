40|$|Functional {{delineated}} labour <b>market</b> <b>regions</b> {{are needed}} for regional economic analyses. In dependence {{of the definition of}} regions economic regions in space can be seen as rich or poor areas. In addition to this statistical and econometric reasons argue for using functional labour <b>market</b> <b>regions.</b> The available definitions of functional units are based mostly on data from 1980 s and 1990 s. To that extent a new delineation is required. We use a factor analysis with an oblique rotation and receive 150 labour <b>market</b> <b>regions,</b> which consist of one or more administrative units (Kreise). These labour <b>markets</b> <b>regions</b> fulfil the criterion of reasonable commuting time (maximally 45 to 60 minutes in dependence of the attractiveness of the centre).

40|$|There are two delineations of German labour <b>market</b> <b>regions.</b> On the {{one hand}} the 'Gemeinschaftsaufgabe Verbesserung der regionalen Wirtschaftsstruktur' uses labour <b>market</b> <b>regions</b> for {{business}} development programs. Their demarcation is based on 270 functional areas after a modification for the regions of Berlin/Brandenburg. On the other hand there is a demarcation of Eckey/Kosfeld/T (2006). Their labour <b>market</b> <b>regions</b> are more spacious compared to the regions of the 'Gemeinschaftsaufgabe', because their data set covers 150 spatial units. Both definitions are based on commuter flows, and the regions are quite independent economic areas. Labour <b>market</b> <b>regions</b> {{are more suitable for}} labour economic analyses than administrative units such as Kreise, federal states, NUTS- 2 -regions etc. The articles uses the example Berlin/Brandenburg and points out, how both demarcations are calculated.

40|$|We {{present a}} Cournot model with {{symmetric}} 8 ̆ 5 rms selling (homogeneous) products {{in a high}} demand and a low demand <b>market</b> <b>region.</b> Buyers are mobile but restricted by travel costs, so that imperfect arbitrage occurs when prices di¤er in both <b>market</b> <b>regions.</b> With mobile buyers market equilibria are distorted away from Cournot out-comes, and a merger reduces this distortion by widening the price di¤erential between both <b>market</b> <b>regions.</b> Moreover, a merger {{can lead to a}} high-price equilibrium outcome in which only the high-demand <b>market</b> <b>region</b> is served. As this high-price outcome can be pay-o ¤ dominant, we interpret the realization of the high-price outcome as a "coordinated e¤ect " of a merger. The coordinated e¤ect becomes more likely (i) the lower the 8 ̆ 5 rmsability to segment consumers (i. e., the more mobile buyers are) and (ii) the higher the concentration of the industry. The last observation points at a so far neglected danger of mergers in industries as the pharmaceutical industry, where coordinated e¤ects of mergers may imply disastrous e¤ects on developing countries consumer welfare...|$|R

Moreover, we establish that compared to developed <b>market</b> <b>regions,</b> emerging <b>market</b> <b>regions</b> have four main dissimilarities: the total risk premiums are significantly higher, more volatile, dominated by regional residual risk factors and reflect mostly regional events.

However, there are now various problems occurred in this market that will certainly influenc the consumer's perception. The research aims to identify and to analyze the service improvement of market facilities in Johar <b>Market</b> <b>region</b> based on consumer's satisfaction level and to direct the service quality improvement of the market facilities. This research uses qualitative explanatory analysis that is to describe the existing conditions and activities in Johar <b>Market</b> <b>region</b> and qualitative comparative analysis {{that is used to}} analyze the service improvement of the market facilities. The result shows that generally the consumers consider that Johar market facilities have not yet accommodated their needs and interests. The consumers dissatisfy with bad air circulation and illumination, pedestrian's circulation, and supporting infrastructure. Their perceptions are worsen by the street vendors disturbance, tidal flooding problems, traffic jam, in-disciplined public transportation, unavailability of pedestrians, lack of vegetation, and environmental chaos. Thus the consumers demand an improvement to give satisfaction during shopping. Based on some necessities for facility services at Johar <b>Market</b> <b>region,</b> it is recommended to discipline and relocate the street vendors, re-converse the square to be public space, manage Johar <b>Market</b> <b>region</b> without changing its characteristics as historical region, create it to be shopping tourism region, and improve the supporting infrastructure and commodity which will attract community and stakeholder participation in the ethic to develop...|$|R

When we group the 90 labour <b>market</b> <b>regions</b> in Norway into five categories according to the centre–periphery pattern, the group of larger urban regions has the highest proportion of Skattefunn projects. Apart from this, the regional distribution is fairly even, but nevertheless signifies a centre-periphery pattern when overlooking the Oslo region. However, significant differences exist among individual labour <b>market</b> <b>regions</b> within the five regional categories. The Skattefunn scheme tends to favour firms in specific industries located in regions with relatively extensive knowledge infrastructure.|$|R

The results indicate that the quit propensity to all four destinations is negatively related to student performance. The result is qualitatively independent of whether student performance is measured by examination results or teacher graduation.

The objective is to set production at each production facility and to select a supply policy such that total production and transportation costs are minimized.
