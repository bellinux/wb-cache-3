He attended the state Republican convention that nominated Hayes for a third term as governor in 1875, and campaigned again for his old friend in the election that fall. The next year, McKinley undertook a high-profile case defending a group of coal miners arrested for rioting after a clash with strikebreakers. Lynch, McKinley's opponent in the 1871 election, and his partner, William R. Day, were the <b>opposing</b> <b>counsel,</b> and the mine owners included Mark Hanna, a Cleveland businessman. Taking the case pro bono, he was successful in getting {{all but one of}} the miners acquitted. The case raised McKinley's standing among laborers, a crucial part of the Stark County electorate, and also introduced him to Hanna, who would become his strongest backer in years to come.|$|E
5|$|At {{the federal}} level, Scientology lost a {{complaint}} against continued surveillance by the BfV in November 2004. The federal court based its opinion on its judgment that the aims of Scientology, as outlined by L. Ron Hubbard in his writings, were incompatible with the German constitution. Lawyers acting for the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution pointed out that Hubbard had written that civil rights, for example, should be restricted to Scientologists, and they asserted that the Scientology organization was taking systematic steps to infiltrate society and government institutions {{in order to prevent}} anti-Scientology legislation. <b>Opposing</b> <b>counsel</b> acting for the Church of Scientology had contended that Scientology was non-political, its aims were the liberation of the human being, and that Hubbard's instructions were valid only within the Church of Scientology and were subject to interpretation, and at any rate there was no effort to implement these instructions in Germany. The court disagreed and ruled that many sources, some of them not accessible to the general public, indicated that the aims of the Church of Scientology did include the abrogation of the principle of equality and other essential human rights.|$|E

40|$|During {{the nineteenth}} century, the inquisitorial justice system, {{in which the}} {{investigation}} was typically overseen by a prosecutor or an examining magistrate, and {{the conduct of the}} trial was largely {{in the hands of the}} court, was replaced by the adversarial justice system. In the adversarial model, both the prosecutor and the defense were responsible for gathering evidence and presenting a narrative of the crime during the trial. Therefore, the courtroom became a sentimental theater in which <b>opposing</b> <b>counsels</b> recreated for the jury the story of the defendant and the events leading to the crime. The trial, therefore, represented the exclusive forum for seeking out and determining the truth...|$|R

The quality of legal argument was high; Bacon was a [...] "skillful, subtle intelect" [...] capable of distinguishing the precedent brought up by Coke, while Doddridge, a member of the Society of Antiquaries, knew the records even better than Coke did. Coke, rather than directly confronting <b>opposing</b> <b>counsel,</b> made a twofold argument; firstly, that the fact that the King's Bench had been allowed to hear assumpsit actions for so long meant that it was acceptable, based on institutional inertia, and second that, on the subject of assumpsit being used for breaches of promise, that the original agreement included an implied promise to make payment.|$|E

While <b>opposing</b> <b>counsel</b> claimed Scrushy was a [...] "hands-on manager who treated the company as a personal piggy bank," [...] Scrushy continued to assign blame to his subordinates and maintain that he did nothing wrong. Closing arguments were heard in the trial on May 27, 2009. On June 18, 2009, Judge Horn ordered Scrushy to pay $2.87 billion in damages. Judge Horn stated, [...] "Scrushy knew of and actively participated in the fraud" [...] and referred to Scrushy as the [...] "CEO of the fraud".

By {{pleading}} guilty on January 13 to the charges brought against him, Dahmer had waived his rights to an initial trial to establish guilt (as defined in Wisconsin law). The issue debated by <b>opposing</b> <b>counsels</b> at Dahmer's trial {{was to determine whether}} he suffered from either a mental or a personality disorder: the prosecution claiming that any disorders did not deprive Dahmer of the ability to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to deprive him of the ability to resist his impulses; the defense arguing that Dahmer suffered from a mental disease and was driven by obsessions and impulses he was unable to control.|$|R

He declared bankruptcy to erase debts incurred before his return to St. Petersburg. He received a reprimand from the state bar in early 2001. During a criminal trial, he had surreptitiously gone through a report on the <b>opposing</b> <b>counsel's</b> table in the courtroom. He readily admitted he had made a mistake and apologized.

Serjeant Adams concluded his advocacy by proclaiming that [...] "there is nothing in the declaration which shews that this was anything more than a mere accident; and for a mere accident which happens in a master's service, the master is not responsible." [...] As with the arguments presented by his <b>opposing</b> <b>counsel,</b> Adams never raised the prospect of vitiating his client's liability due to the intervening act of a fellow servant.|$|E

But they were going as second-class passengers and their accommodation therefore was limited. Dick had insisted on this economy, which was hardly necessary to Caldigate, and which was not absolutely pressed upon the other. But Dick had insisted. 'Let us begin as we mean to go on,' he had said; 'of course we've got to rough it. We shall come across something a good deal harder than second-class fare before we have made our fortunes, and worked probably with mates more uncouth than second-class passengers.' It was impossible to <b>oppose</b> <b>counsel</b> such as this, and therefore second-class tickets were taken on board the Goldfinder.|$|R

In a tactful reference to the primary dispute between <b>opposing</b> <b>counsels</b> at the trial, Allan Green closed his opening speech with a reply Nilsen had given to police {{in response to a question}} as to whether he needed to kill: [...] "At the precise moment of the act , I believe I am right in doing the act". To counteract this argument, Green added: [...] "The Crown says that even if there was mental abnormality, that was not sufficient to diminish substantially his responsibility for these killings".|$|R
50|$|However, {{the courts}} {{role was to}} rule on whether {{publication}} was legal, not whether it was wise. In keeping with the usual practice of keeping {{a temporary restraining order}} in effect for as short a time as possible, Warren ordered that hearings be held on a preliminary injunction in one weeks time, on March 16. At the request of both parties, this was postponed to March 26 so they would have time to file their briefs and affidavits. The parties were therefore back in court again on March 26 for a hearing on the governments request for a preliminary injunction. Warren decided not to hold an evidentiary hearing at which the opposing teams of experts could be cross examined. He also declined a suggestion by the Federation of American Scientists in its amicus curiae brief that a panel of experts be charged with examining the issue. The case relied on written affidavits and briefs, and the <b>opposing</b> <b>counsels</b> oral arguments.|$|R

[...] In 1988, the University of Minnesota Law School awarded a Mary and McCants Stewart Foundation scholarship. [...] During its inauguration, J. Clay Smith, Jr., former dean of the Howard University School of Law, noted that [...] "Despite the ominous shadow of segregation, Stewart refused to sacrifice his principles at the expense of his clients or to derogate his beliefs."

2500|$|Defense {{attorney}} Jose Baez told jurors {{his biggest}} {{fear was that}} they would base their verdict on emotions, not evidence. [...] "The strategy behind that is, if you hate her, if you think she's a lying, no-good slut, then you'll start {{to look at this}} evidence in a different light", he said. [...] "Itold you {{at the very beginning of}} this case that this was an accident that snowballed out of control... What made it unique is not what happened, but who it happened to." [...] He explained Casey Anthony's behavior as being the result of her dysfunctional family situation. At one point as Baez spoke, Ashton could be seen smiling or chuckling behind his hand. This prompted Baez to refer to him as [...] "this laughing guy right here". The judge called a sidebar conference, then a recess. When court resumed, he chastised both sides, saying both Ashton and Baez had violated his order that neither side should make disparaging remarks about <b>opposing</b> <b>counsel.</b> After both attorneys apologized, the judge accepted the apologies but warned that a recurrence would have the offending attorney excluded from the courtroom.|$|E
2500|$|If actual bias on {{the part}} of a judge or {{tribunal}} can be proved by a party to a legal proceeding, or {{on the part}} of a public authority by a person aggrieved by its decision, the High Court can [...] the judgment or decision. A decision-maker will be deemed actually biased if it is shown that he or she was influenced by partiality in reaching the decision or was actually prejudiced in reaching the decision. In Chee Siok Chin v. Attorney-General (2006), allegations of actual bias were made based on the actions of the judge, Justice Belinda Ang. Her failure to prevent the <b>opposing</b> <b>counsel</b> from interrupting the appellant was supposedly reflective of a biased state of mind. Justice Ang adopted the view in Locabail (UK) Ltd. v. Bayfield Properties Ltd. (1999) that cases of actual bias are rare due to the difficulty of proving the existence of a prejudiced judicial mindset. Rather, the inclination of the law [...] "is to protect litigants who can discharge the lesser burden of showing a real danger of bias without requiring them to show that such bias actually exists".|$|E

2500|$|On July 27, Arnold Davies testified as to {{his being}} {{in the company of}} Collins {{throughout}} the late afternoon and evening of July 23, 1969 (hours after Beineman had last been seen alive). The following day, following a consultation with <b>opposing</b> <b>counsels,</b> Judge John Conlin allowed Davis to testify as to having observed Collins hurriedly remove a laundry box containing women's clothing and jewelry from his apartment and place this box in the trunk of his car two days prior to his arrest. (The prosecution had initially intended to question Davis in detail as to each of the contents of this laundry box upon the grounds that the contents Davies had previously described to investigators may include Beineman's missing cut-off blue jeans; however, Collins' attorneys successfully objected to this motion upon the grounds that Collins was solely on trial for the murder of Karen Sue Beineman, and this testimony could suggest a link to the six other victims of the Michigan Murders then-linked to the same perpetrator. The prosecution was therefore limited to questioning Davis with regards to whether the contents of this box included women's clothing and jewelry, without specifically describing any particular item.) ...|$|R
60|$|The ship being fitted out, and {{all things}} ready, we set sail the first of September, 1659, being the same day eight-years I left my father and, mother in Yorkshire. We sailed northward upon the coast, {{in order to gain}} Africa, till we made Cape Augustine; from whence going farther into the ocean, out of sight of land, we steered as though we were bound for the isle Fernand de Norenba, leaving the islands on the east; and then it was that we met with a terrible tempest, which {{continued}} for twelve days successively, so that the wind carried us wheresoever they pleased. In this perplexity one of our men died, and one man and a boy were washed overboard. When the weather cleared up a little, we found ourselves eleven degrees north latitude, upon the coast of Guinea. Upon this the captain gave reasons for returning; which I <b>opposed,</b> <b>counselling</b> him to stand away for Barbadoes, which as I supposed, might be attained in fifteen days. So altering our course, we sailed north-west and by west, in order to reach the Leeward Islands; but a second storm succeeding, drove us to the westward; so that we were justly afraid of falling into the hands of cruel savages, or the paws of devouring beasts of prey.|$|R
2500|$|After the {{evidence}} was presented proving the facts at issue, Maury's counsel gave a speech in praise of the clergy, {{many of whom were}} in attendance. Henry responded with a one-hour speech, ignoring the question of damages, but which focused on the unconstitutionality of the veto of the Two Penny Act by the king's government. Henry deemed any king who annulled good laws, such as the Two Penny Act, as a [...] "tyrant" [...] who [...] "forfeits all right to his subjects' obedience", and the clergy, by challenging an impartial law designed to bring economic relief, had shown themselves to be [...] "enemies of the community". The <b>opposing</b> <b>counsel</b> accused Henry of treason, and some took up that cry, but Henry continued, and the judge did nothing to stop him. Henry urged the jury to make an example of Maury, for the benefit of any who might seek to imitate him, and suggested the jury return damages of one farthing. The jury was out for only moments, and fixed damages at one penny. Henry was hailed as a hero. According to biographer Henry Mayer, Henry had [...] "defined the prerogatives of the local elite by the unorthodox means of mobilizing the emotions of the lower ranks of religious and political outsiders." [...] Henry's popularity greatly increased, and he added 164 new clients in the year after the Parson's Cause.|$|E

40|$|Determining {{the guilt}} or innocence of the accused {{is one of the}} {{ultimate}} purposes of any criminal proceeding. To accomplish this purpose it is necessary to attempt a reconstruction of what occurred in the past. Hence, the function of a trial is to bring to light all of the facts which are relevant to the alleged crime or defenses which are the subject of the trial. Formerly the “sporting” theory of justice was widespread, and under it the fact-finding processes of the courts took on some of the aspects of an athletic contest. These were truly adversary proceedings, sometimes {{to such an extent that}} the emphasis seemed to bear more upon the tactical skill and finesse of the respective advocates than upon the real purpose of a trial, namely, a correct and complete revelation of all pertinent facts. The adoption in 1946 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure is the most notable attempt in recent years to modify the “sporting” theory. ” One of the most important innovations wrought by the adoption of these rules is the development of various discovery devices through which various elements of <b>opposing</b> <b>counsel’s</b> case may be brought to light. Of course, state as well as federal courts are gradually reforming their judicial processes, and improvements in the processes of state courts often embody many of the same principles found in the federal rules.
