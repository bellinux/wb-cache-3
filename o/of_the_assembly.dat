By 17January, the majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Assembly</b> had become convinced that the best way forward was a presbyterian system {{similar to that of the}} Scots, but the dissenting brethren were allowed to continue to state their case in hope that they could eventually be reconciled.

The Confession was printed and sent to Parliament in December. The House of Commons requested scripture citations be added to the Confession, which were provided in April 1648. Parliament approved the Confession with revisions to the chapters on church censures, synods and councils, and marriage on 20June 1648. The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland had already adopted the Confession without revision in 1647. The restoration of Charles II in 1660 effectively made this legislation a nullity.|$|E
