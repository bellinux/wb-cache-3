Pneumatic motors {{are also used}} stationary {{in a wide range}} of industrial applications. Though overall energy efficiency <b>of</b> <b>pneumatics</b> <b>tools</b> is low and they require access to a compressed-air source, there are several advantages over electric tools. They offer greater power density (a smaller pneumatic motor can provide the same amount of power as a larger electric motor), do not require an auxiliary speed controller (adding to its compactness), generate less heat, and can be used in more volatile atmospheres as they do not require electric power [...] and do not create sparks. They can be loaded to stop with full torque without damages.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s Atlas Copco {{was the world}} leader in rock {{drilling}} and pneumatics. Seeing the potential in industrial tools, they purchased Chicago Pneumatic Tools in 1987, which opened up the important American, French and British markets. Atlas Copco then {{became one of the}} world's largest manufacturers <b>of</b> <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tools</b> and monitoring systems. At the end of the 1980s the company's geographical foothold grew and assortments expanded due to several acquisitions including the French company Ets. Georges Renault that manufactured pneumatic power tools. The British company Desoutter Brothers Plc. that supplied industrial tools and monitoring systems was purchased in 1990. In 1992 AEG Elektrowerkzeuge was purchased and in 1995 Milwaukee Electric Tool was acquired, which further strengthened the company's reach. In 1997, Atlas Copco made its biggest and most important acquisition with the purchasing of the Prime Service Corporation, which was the largest machine leasing company in the United States. The North American Rental Service Corporation was purchased in 1999.|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. December 2009. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisor: William Durfee. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); iv, 49 pages, appendices A-D. Ill. (some col.) Pneumatic hand tools {{have been used}} for many decades. These tools help users accomplish tasks with much less effort than is required with manual tools. However, one significant drawback <b>of</b> <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tools</b> compared with manual hand tools is that the user is disconnected from the output forces the tool is creating. This has various safety and functionality issues. A pair of pneumatic powered loppers was developed to demonstrate the potential of force-multiplying, pneumatically powered hand tools with haptic control. A purely mechanical control system was tested and found to provide proportional feedback over the range of operating conditions. The work required to cut through different sizes of dowels and branches was also calculated and tested against the prototype to determine the amount of compressed air needed to operate the loppers. It was determined that the loppers could have an onboard, high pressure tank that could provide enough energy for average homeowner use. For commercial use a larger external tank would be required...|$|E
40|$|A {{simulated}} drywall plastering {{task was}} used in this study to evaluate the potential health and safety benefits <b>of</b> using a <b>pneumatic</b> drywall finishing system. The plastering task was performed in a controlled job setting. Muscular exertion while performing the plastering task was measured using electromyography (EMG). Usability questionnaires were given to all participants. Mixed findings were observed for the EMG dependent variables. Significant reduction in the number and duration of muscular rest and static load level were observed for the left forearm flexor muscles when working with the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tool.</b> However, significant increase in the median and peak load level were observed in the right forearm flexor muscle when working with the Apla-Tech <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tool.</b> The usability questionnaire indicated {{that a majority of the}} workers preferred the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tool.</b> The use <b>of</b> ladders and rolling scaffolds was reduced when working with the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tool</b> because the tool allowed all workers to reach higher corners and ceiling height. Based on the EMG measures, tool preference and reduction of risk of traumatic slips and falls indicate that the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tool</b> is an effective tool for applying compound onto drywall joints.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—Vibration {{white finger}} (VWF), {{also known as}} "occupational Raynaud's phenomenon", is marked by {{arterial}} hyperresponsiveness and vasoconstriction during cold stimulation. The impact of tobacco use, and by extension stopping smoking, on the long term course of the disease has been inconclusively characterised. The objectives of this study included assessment {{of the impact of}} tobacco use on symptoms and on objective tests in shipyard workers exposed to vibration, and in gauging the natural history of the disorder after stopping exposure and changing smoking patterns.  METHODS—In a cross sectional investigation, 601  current and former users <b>of</b> <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tools</b> were evaluated subjectively for cold related vascular symptoms, and tested by cold challenge plethysmography. There was follow up and subsequent testing of 199  members of the severely effected subgroup of smokers and non-smokers, many of whom had stopped smoking in the interval between tests. Effects of smoking and stopping smoking on symptoms and plethsymographic results were assessed.  RESULTS—Symptoms and measured abnormal vascular responses related to cold were more severe in smokers than in non-smokers. Follow up of 199  severely effected members of the cohort, all removed from exposure for 2  years, indicated that smokers were almost twice as likely to have more severe vasospasm (test finger/control finger systolic blood pressure% (FSBP%) < 30) than were non-smokers (− 32. 2 % v 17. 4 %). 53  Subjects who stopped smoking during the interval between tests improved, and were indistinguishable from non-smokers similarly exposed to vibration. Additional physiological benefits of stopping smoking were still apparent at further follow up examination, 1  year later. Improvements evident on plethysmography were not accompanied by improvements in symptoms, which were unaffected by smoking.  CONCLUSIONS—Smoking seems to delay physiological improvement in response to cold challenge in workers with VWF, after the end of exposure to vibration. Symptoms were less likely to improve over time than digital blood pressure, and were less affected by smoking.    Keywords: vibration white finger; cold challenge plethysmography; smoking; Raynaud's phenomeno...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT A {{combined}} epidemiological {{and clinical}} study of vibration-induced white finger (VWF) {{was carried out}} involving 115 men in four fluorspar mines. The overall prevalence ofVWF {{was found to be}} 50 % among 42 vibration-exposed subjects, while that of constitutional white finger (CWF) was 5 - 6 % in all men studied. The VWF latent interval was 1 - 19 years with a mean of 5 6 years. An association was observed between the exposure time and VWF stages which included 18 men in Stage 0, three in the intermediate stage of OT/ON, five in Stage 2 and 16 in Stage 3; no men were seen at Stage 1. Among those with VWF in Stage 3, the index, middle and ring fingers were affected in both hands and the little fingers and thumbs were last to be involved. Clinically, on general examination, apart from vibration-induced white finger, the men in the 'vibration ' group were as healthy as those in the 'control ' group. The circumference of the index fingers was not significantly different for the different groups. Neurological tests showed that the ridge test and, to a lesser extent, the two-point discrimination and the light touch tests, could be regarded as useful for the diagnosis of VWF. Mining in the Northern Pennines is known to have been in progress soon after the Norman conquest. In the twentieth century, lead mining in this area has been at its lowest ebb, but this has been compensated to some extent by the development of fluorspar mining which was originally started in 1882 (Dunham, 1949). Modern technology and wet drilling have minimised the incidence of occupational lung diseases but, on the other hand, percussion tools have created another hazard among the rock-drillers, namely vibration-induced white finger (VWF) or Raynaud's phenomenon of occupational origin. Although the use <b>of</b> <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tools</b> has been known since 1839 in the French mines (Schumacher, 1972) its association with the symptoms in the hands was not reported until 1911 (Hunter, 1969).

40|$|Risks and {{benefits}} of whole body vibration training in older people Regular whole body vibration training, i. e. standing on a plat-form that vibrates at a high frequency over a small ampli-tude, {{has been reported to}} produce neuromuscular adap-tation and increase bone mineral density in some frailer populations [1]. As such, it has attracted interest for its poten-tial benefits regarding physical function, fall and fracture risk in older people. These potential benefits could however be counteracted by detrimental effects associated with vibration exposure. Harmful effects of vibration exposure were first identi-fied almost 100 years ago through study of the health <b>of</b> operators <b>of</b> <b>pneumatic</b> power <b>tools</b> [2].

40|$|Turbo gas {{compressors}} {{are among the}} most used machines ever invented. In the process industry, they are used intensively to provide compressed air for all types <b>of</b> <b>pneumatic</b> instruments and <b>tools.</b> These compressors suffer from an instability known as surge which usually occurs at low flow rates. The flow becomes seriously unstable and sometimes reverses. Surge has been a major problem for designers and users since the invention of the turbo-compressor. Although many successful echniques have been proposed to tackle the surge problem, most of them seem to offer to control at a single operating point or when nonlinear control is used the aethod tends to be seriously complex. The area remains very challenging for control engineers because of the non-linear nature of the phenomena and the complexity of the machine itself.
