5|$|Some TLPs may {{be caused}} by gas {{escaping}} from underground cavities. These gaseous events are purported to display a distinctive reddish hue, while others have appeared as white clouds or an indistinct haze.

5|$|The {{nature of}} the dark patches, which mainly occur on the leading {{hemisphere}} and inside craters, is not known.

5|$|After {{being sent}} toward the Moon by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts {{separated}} the spacecraft {{from it and}} traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the lunar module Eagle and landed in the Sea of Tranquility. They stayed {{a total of about}} 21.5 hours on the lunar surface. The astronauts used Eagles upper stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle before they performed the maneuvers that blasted them out <b>of</b> <b>lunar</b> orbit on a trajectory back to Earth. They returned to Earth and landed in the Pacific Ocean on July 24.|$|E
5|$|Faget's {{preliminary}} Apollo design {{employed a}} cone-shaped command module, supported {{by one of}} several service modules providing propulsion and electrical power, sized appropriately for the space station, cislunar, and lunar landing missions. Once Kennedy's Moon landing goal became official, detailed design began of a Command/Service Module (CSM) in which the crew would spend the entire direct-ascent mission and lift off from the lunar surface for the return trip, after being soft-landed by a larger landing propulsion module. The final choice <b>of</b> <b>lunar</b> orbit rendezvous changed the CSM's role to the translunar ferry used to transport the crew, along with a new spacecraft, the Lunar Excursion Module (LEM, later shortened to Lunar Module, LM) which would take two men to the lunar surface and return them to the CSM.|$|E

40|$|The {{configuration}} combination design method <b>of</b> wheel-legged <b>lunar</b> rover was proposed, which {{regards the}} mobile mechanism <b>of</b> wheel-legged <b>lunar</b> rover as three sub-configurations: wheel-legged mechanism, suspension and bodywork.

5|$|North American Aviation won the {{contract}} to build the CSM, and also {{the second stage of}} the Saturn V launch vehicle for NASA. Because the CSM design was started early before the selection <b>of</b> <b>lunar</b> orbit rendezvous, the service propulsion engine was sized to lift the CSM off of the Moon, and thus was oversized to about twice the thrust required for translunar flight. Also, there was no provision for docking with the Lunar Module. A 1964 program definition study concluded that the initial design should be continued as Block I which would be used for early testing, while Block II, the actual lunar spacecraft, would incorporate the docking equipment and take advantage of the lessons learned in Block I development.|$|E
5|$|Project A119, {{also known}} as A Study <b>of</b> <b>Lunar</b> Research Flights, was a top-secret plan {{developed}} in 1958 by the United States Air Force. The aim {{of the project was}} to detonate a nuclear bomb on the Moon which would help in answering some of the mysteries in planetary astronomy and astrogeology. If the explosive device detonated on the surface, not in a lunar crater, the flash of explosive light would have been faintly visible to people on earth with their naked eye, a show of force resulting in a possible boosting of domestic morale in the capabilities of the United States, a boost that was needed after the Soviet Union took an early lead in the Space Race and was also working on a similar project.|$|E
5|$|Several {{relativistic}} {{effects are}} directly related to the relativity of direction.
