40|$|Objective : To {{report the}} {{perspectives}} of <b>optometrists,</b> ophthalmologists and patients on a model of shared care for patients with chronic eye diseases. Design, setting and participants : Qualitative study of a model of shared care between <b>optometrists</b> and ophthalmologists for patients with stable age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma, trialled by the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital in Melbourne during 2007 – 2009. Semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} <b>optometrists,</b> ophthalmologists and patients at completion of the project to obtain their perspectives on this model. Results : Seventeen <b>optometrists</b> submitted expressions of interest to participate, and 12 completed web-based training modules and clinical observerships and adhered to specified examination and reporting protocols. All five participating ophthalmologists and 11 of the <b>optometrists</b> were interviewed. Ninety-eight patients participated and 37 were interviewed. <b>Optometrists</b> not only met ophthalmologists’ expectations but exceeded them, appropriately detecting and referring patients with additional, previously undetected conditions. Patients reported savings in travel time and were satisfied with the quality of care they received. <b>Optometrists,</b> ophthalmologists and patients indicated a general acceptance of shared care arrangements, although there were some issues relating to interprofessional trust. Conclusions : Shared care between local <b>optometrists</b> and hospital-based ophthalmologists can help to reduce patient waiting time for review and offers an opportunity for these two groups of eye care professionals to collaborate in providing localised care for the benefit of patients. However, trust and relationship building need to be further developed. <br /...|$|R

Barry's case has been reported on by neurologist Oliver Sacks. Also David H. Hubel, winner of the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Torsten Wiesel for their discoveries concerning information processing in the visual system, commented positively on her case. In 2009, Barry published a book Fixing My Gaze: A Scientist's Journey into Seeing in Three Dimensions, reporting on her own and several other cases of stereopsis recovery.|$|E
25|$|Floaters {{present at}} birth usually remain lifelong, while those that appear later may {{disappear}} within weeks or months. They are not uncommon, {{and do not}} cause serious problems for most persons; they represent {{one of the most}} common presentations to hospital eye services. A survey of optometrists in 2002 suggested that an average of 14 patients per month per <b>optometrist</b> presented with symptoms of floaters in the UK. However, floaters are more than a nuisance and a distraction to those with severe cases, especially if the spots seem to constantly drift through the field of vision. The shapes are shadows projected onto the retina by tiny structures of protein or other cell debris discarded over the years and trapped in the vitreous humour. Floaters can even be seen when the eyes are closed on especially bright days, when sufficient light penetrates the eyelids to cast the shadows. It is not, however, only elderly persons who are troubled by floaters; they can also become a problem to younger people, especially if they are myopic. They are also common after cataract operations or after trauma.|$|E
25|$|If {{keratoconus}} is suspected, the ophthalmologist or <b>optometrist</b> will {{search for}} other characteristic {{findings of the}} disease by means of slit lamp examination of the cornea. An advanced case is usually readily apparent to the examiner, and can provide for an unambiguous diagnosis prior to more specialized testing. Under close examination, a ring of yellow-brown to olive-green pigmentation known as a Fleischer ring {{can be observed in}} around half of keratoconic eyes. The Fleischer ring, caused by deposition of the iron oxide hemosiderin within the corneal epithelium, is subtle and may not be readily detectable in all cases, but becomes more evident when viewed under a cobalt blue filter. Similarly, around 50% of subjects exhibit Vogt's striae, fine stress lines within the cornea caused by stretching and thinning. The striae temporarily disappear while slight pressure is applied to the eyeball. A highly pronounced cone can create a V-shaped indentation in the lower eyelid when the person's gaze is directed downwards, known as Munson's sign. Other clinical signs of keratoconus will normally have presented themselves long before Munson's sign becomes apparent, and so this finding, though a classic sign of the disease, tends not to be of primary diagnostic importance.|$|E

25|$|In the USA, corneal transplants (also {{known as}} corneal grafts) for {{keratoconus}} are usually performed under sedation as outpatient surgery. In other countries, such as Australia and the UK, {{the operation is}} commonly performed with the person undergoing a general anaesthetic. All cases require a careful follow-up with an eye doctor (ophthalmologist or <b>optometrist)</b> {{for a number of}} years. Frequently, vision is greatly improved after the surgery, but even if the actual visual acuity does not improve, because the cornea is a more normal shape after the healing is completed, people can more easily be fitted with corrective lenses. Complications of corneal transplants are mostly related to vascularization of the corneal tissue and rejection of the donor cornea. Vision loss is very rare, though difficult-to-correct vision is possible. When rejection is severe, repeat transplants are often attempted, and are frequently successful. Keratoconus will not normally reoccur in the transplanted cornea; incidences of this have been observed, but are usually attributed to incomplete excision of the original cornea or inadequate screening of the donor tissue. The long-term outlook for corneal transplants performed for keratoconus is usually favorable once the initial healing period is completed and a few years have elapsed without problems.|$|E
500|$|Accommodation is {{the process}} by which the eye {{increases}} optical power to maintain focus on the retina while shifting its gaze to a closer point. The long-standing medical consensus is that this is accomplished by action of the ciliary muscle, a muscle within the eye, which adjusts the curvature of the eye's crystalline lens. This explanation is based in the observed effect of atropine temporarily preventing accommodation when applied to the ciliary muscle, as well as images reflected on the crystalline lens becoming smaller as the eye shifts focus to a closer point, indicating a change in the lens' shape. Bates rejected this explanation, and in his 1920 book presented photographs that he said showed that the image remained the same size even as the eye shifted focus, concluding from this that the lens was not a factor in accommodation. However, <b>optometrist</b> Philip Pollack in a 1956 work characterized these photographs as [...] "so blurred {{that it is impossible to}} tell whether one image is larger than the other", in contrast to later photographs that clearly showed a change in the size of the reflected images, just as had been observed since the late nineteenth century.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the inter-observer agreement for measuring limbal anterior chamber depth (LACD) using the van Herick test in community <b>optometrists,</b> glaucoma specialist <b>optometrists</b> and ophthalmologists. Methods: The study {{was divided into}} two phases. In the first phase, {{a random sample of}} 100 UK community <b>optometrists</b> were given an opportunity to select and grade eight digital slit-lamp images of anterior chamber angles using the original van Herick 4 point grading scale. The images were included in a clinical decision making study using computerised virtual case vignettes. In the second phase, hospital-based glaucoma specialist <b>optometrists</b> and glaucoma sub-specialist ophthalmologists graded the LACD of the right eye using a 7 -point % grading scale in 57 consecutively presenting patients with suspect glaucoma. Inter-observer agreement was assessed using linearly weighted kappa (??w). Results: Inter-observer agreement for community <b>optometrists</b> was moderate, with a mean ??w for grading photographic images of 0. 50 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 43 - 0. 57). Overall, ninety-two percent of observations were within one grade of the actual grade, although grading of narrow angles was associated with a 13 % false negative error rate (based on a???????grade 2 threshold). For Phase 2 of the study, pairwise comparisons between <b>optometrists</b> and ophthalmologists showed that agreement was moderate to substantial (mean ??w??=?? 0. 54 - 0. 65) with a false negative rate of 1. 9 % (based on a??????? 25 % threshold). Grading accuracy of specialist <b>optometrists</b> and ophthalmologists were equivalent. Conclusions: In summary, the present study found that community <b>optometrists</b> showed moderate inter-observer agreement for grading LACD. Glaucoma specialist <b>optometrists</b> showed moderate to substantial agreement with weighted kappa values that were equivalent to sub-specialist ophthalmologists. The augmented 7 -point % grading scale is intuitive and potentially offers greater accuracy for grading narrow angles than the traditional 4 -point scale for grading LACD...|$|R
