After making {{intermediate}} stops in Baltimore and Hampton Roads, she sailed for Halifax with a load of scrap iron on 17 July, reaching her destination three days later. She departed in convoy HX 140 on 22 July and arrived at Belfast Lough on 5 August and Newport on 8 August. After arriving at Milford Haven on 25 August, she sailed from there two days later in convoy ON 10 for Halifax, where she arrived on 13 September. From there, Empire Wildebeeste sailed to Montreal and back to Halifax by 5 October. She departed Halifax that same day {{as a part of}} convoy HX 153, but had unspecified problems that caused her to drop <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> in at St. John's, Newfoundland, on 11 October. After aborted attempts to sail east in convoys SC 50 and SC 52, Empire Wildebeeste finally reached Loch Ewe on 25 November as a part of convoy SC 54 and Methil on 30 November.|$|E

25|$|Concept Fields {{have many}} objects {{set up to}} allow players to remain hidden from their opponents. A concept field is a perfect {{man-made}} creation for paintball games. A field in this style is usually outdoors and almost always has a theme.

25|$|There are {{two main}} types of wrap - {{stretchy}} and woven. Stretchy wraps are generally made of knits such as jersey or interlock. It is easy to take babies {{in and out of}} a stretchy wrap. This can be easier for the wearer as the sling often remains tied on and the baby is lifted <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> back in as required. Several factors influence stretchiness: carriers with any spandex or lycra content will tend to be very stretchy, carriers which are 100% cotton or other natural fibers will tend to have less lengthwise stretch.|$|E

25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1945, Schellenberg instigated further {{meetings}} with Count Bernadotte as an opening to the western powers. He personally went to Stockholm in April 1945 to arrange the meetings for Himmler. Both Himmler and Schellenberg continued {{to believe that the}} Jews interned in concentration camps represented a bargaining chip for the Nazi leadership, one they could use to derive concessions from the Western allies. To foster goodwill for their negotiations, Schellenberg—with Himmler's consent—organised the transport of 1,700 Jews out of German controlled territory to Switzerland and Sweden.

25|$|In 1837, Halbertsma {{had himself}} a large new house built in Grou, {{something}} his brothers were rather boastful of in their letters. He also dressed himself {{according to the}} latest fashion, leading to Eeltsje complaining, in 1841, that his brother had become a dandy. But in the end Halbertsma miscalculated badly: when the shares in other businesses he had invested in dropped sharply in value in 1848, he panicked, sold <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> all his money in rye. When subsequently the rye market also collapsed, he suffered heavy losses amounting to about half of his fortune. This was a severe blow, especially to his ego, which he never truly recovered from.|$|E

He top-scored in the first innings of the First Test with 38, and kept through an English innings of 531 in the Second Test without conceding a bye, but he had not made the quick runs South Africa needed, and after the Third Test he was dropped in favour of Waite.|$|E

25|$|The Bolshevik {{policy of}} terror was more systematic, better organized, and {{targeted}} at whole social classes. Moreover, {{it had been}} thought <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> into practice before {{the outbreak of the}} civil war. The White Terror was never systematized in such a fashion. It was almost invariably the work of detachments that were out of control, and taking measures not officially authorized by the military command that was attempting, without much success, to act as a government. If one discounts the pogroms, which Denikin himself condemned, the White Terror most often was a series of reprisals by the police acting as a sort of military counterespionage force. The Cheka and the Troops for the Internal Defense of the Republic were a structured and powerful instrument of repression of a completely different order, which had support at the highest level from the Bolshevik regime.|$|E

25|$|Somerset batted {{first and}} were all out in around 90 minutes for just 55. Off-spin bowler Roy Tattersall unusually opened the bowling, and took seven for 25. No Somerset batsman reached double figures, and Buse made just five. When Lancashire batted, Buse himself proved almost as deadly, taking {{four of the}} first five wickets that fell for just 46 runs. But then Peter Marner and Alan Wharton decided to hit <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> on a stand of 70 in 25 minutes for the sixth wicket. In all, Lancashire totalled 158, made off just 32 overs, with Buse taking six for 41 and the innings {{finishing}} by teatime on the first day. Somerset's second innings then proved {{no better than the}} first, with Brian Statham joining Tattersall in the wickets. Only a last-wicket partnership of 35 by Jim Redman and the debutant Brian Langford delayed matters at all. Somerset were all out for 79, losing by an innings and 24 runs, with Tattersall having match figures of 13 wickets for 69 runs. The game was over by six o'clock on the evening of the first day.|$|E
25|$|Konbaung {{troops would}} {{now have to}} take Syriam the hard way. The siege {{continued}} {{for the remainder of}} 1755. The French inside were desperate for reinforcements from their India headquarters at Pondicherry. Alaungpaya returned to the front in January 1756 with his two sons, Naungdawgyi and Hsinbyushin. In July, Alaungpaya launched another attack by water and by land, capturing the only French ship left at the port, and the French factory at the outskirts of the town. On 14 July 1756 (3rd waning of Waso 1118 ME), Minhla Minkhaung Kyaw, the chief of musket corps and top Konbaung general, was severely wounded by cannon fire. As Minhla Minkhaung Kyaw lay dying of his wounds, and being brought back by boat, the king went down to the boat himself to see his old childhood friend, who had won him many battles. The king publicly mourned the death of his chief general and honored him with a funeral under a white umbrella before the whole army. The leader of the French, Sieur de Bruno, secretly tried to negotiate with Alaungpaya, but was found <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> in prison by Hanthawaddy commanders. The siege went on.|$|E

The young girl {{is intended to be}} Clarkson as a child, presumably with her young male best friend. The boy hands her a beaded necklace, which she puts on admiringly. The shot closes in on the necklace, then pulls back to reveal it's still worn as a bracelet on the wrist of now-adult Clarkson, her boyfriend (played by Houston Rhines) shows up at her apartment door, presumably after an argument. Clarkson teases him with a set of keys, which she then throws down the toilet. The two are then shown sitting on a couch, reading magazines, when Clarkson grabs her boyfriend's magazine. The two are shown throwing various possessions of one another out of the apartment window, though in a playful manner. Such items include numerous articles of clothing, magazines, a guitar (which Clarkson tries to stop him throwing out), and a fishbowl (with the fish being taken <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> in a glass first, after which they look out the window). After throwing these items out the window, the two are seen sitting affectionately on the couch. Clarkson and her boyfriend are shown still fighting and bickering as they did as children, over the TV Guide and remote control. The latter portion of the video shows the two driving in a first generation Ford Bronco (with the necklace/bracelet hanging from the rear view mirror), eventually getting into an argument. Distracted by the tiff over directions, the Bronco nearly ends up in a head-on collision with an approaching car. After spinning out to avoid the crash, Clarkson simply grabs her boyfriend and pulls him into a kiss, where the video ends.|$|E
