5|$|After missing {{most of the}} 193435 {{domestic}} season due to injury, McCabe scored an unbeaten 189 in the Second Test of the 193536 tour of South Africa, {{including a}} century in one session, taking Australia {{to the brink of}} a world record-breaking victory on a difficult final-day pitch in poor light before the match was called off. It was one of two Test centuries McCabe made on the tour. The following season, he made five fifties in the first four Tests before scoring a century to help Australia win the deciding final Test against the touring Englishmen. In the First Test of the 1938 tour of England, McCabe played what was regarded as his greatest innings, scoring 232 in four hours, including his last 72 in 28 minutes. Bradman regarded the innings as the greatest batting he ever saw. However, none of McCabe’s three most famous innings resulted in an Australian victory; he has a reputation <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>at</b> his best when Australia was in difficulty.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1850, Honório Hermeto {{was back}} in Rio de Janeiro. He had found the months in Pernambuco excruciating. Being named provincial {{president}} {{would have been considered}} a great achievement for a young politician, but it added no luster to the reputation of a seasoned politician and a founding member of his party. Instead <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>at</b> the center of power, he was put in the humiliating position of having to submit to a cabinet composed of men with less political experience, such as Joaquim Rodrigues Torres, Paulino Soares de Sousa (Honório Hermeto's colleague along with Rodrigues Torres in Coimbra) and Eusébio de Queirós. It was particularly grating being subordinated to Paulino Soares and Eusébio de Queirós, protégés whom Honório Hermeto had advanced during the 1830s. While in Pernambuco, Honório Hermeto's actions were frequently reviewed and overturned by the cabinet, often with Eusébio de Queirós leading the criticism.|$|E
5|$|Despite his ongoing {{research}} in Guiana, what Beebe desired most was {{to return to}} the Galápagos, this time with a properly fitted-out scientific research vessel that possessed the ability to dredge animals from beneath the ocean. In 1925, Beebe set out on a second Galápagos expedition, backed by Williams and several other donors. His ship for this expedition was the Arcturus, a steam yacht considerably larger than the Noma that was capable <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>at</b> sea for extended periods of time. The Arcturus was outfitted with Beebe's pulpit and boom walk from the Noma, as well as cages and tanks for live animals, chemicals and vials to preserve dead ones, and a darkroom for developing film and studying the bioluminescent animals they hoped to encounter.|$|E
40|$|The List of Derisible Situations (LDS; Proyer, Hempelmann and Ruch, List of Derisible Situations (LDS), University of Zurich, 2008) {{consists}} of 102 different occasions for <b>being</b> laughed <b>at.</b> They were retrieved in a corpus study and compiled into the LDS. Based on this list, {{information on the}} frequency and the intensity with which people recall <b>being</b> laughed <b>at</b> during a given time-span (12 months in this study) can be collected. An empirical study (N = 114) examined {{the relations between the}} LDS and the fear <b>of</b> <b>being</b> laughed <b>at</b> (gelotophobia), the joy <b>of</b> <b>being</b> laughed <b>at</b> (gelotophilia), and the joy of laughing at others (katagelasticism; Ruch and Proyer this issue). More than 92 % of the participants recalled having been laughed at at least once over the past 12 months. Highest scores were found for experiencing an embarrassing situation, chauvinism <b>of</b> others or <b>being</b> laughed <b>at</b> for doing something awkward or clumsy. Gelotophobia, gelotophilia, and katagelasticism were related about equally to the recalled frequency <b>of</b> events <b>of</b> <b>being</b> laughed <b>at</b> (with the lowest relation to katagelasticism). Gelotophobia, gelotophilia, and katagelasticism yielded a distinct and plausible pattern of correlations to the frequency <b>of</b> events <b>of</b> <b>being</b> laughed <b>at.</b> Gelotophobes recalled the situations <b>of</b> <b>being</b> laughed <b>at</b> with a higher intensity than others. Thus, the fear <b>of</b> <b>being</b> laughed <b>at</b> exists to a large degree independently from actual experiences <b>of</b> <b>being</b> laughed <b>at,</b> but is related to a higher intensity with which these events are experience...|$|R

In his hands are the powers of cyclic destruction, for he wields Fohat beams composed of [...] "bubbles in space" [...] in its higher forms and can deal directly with cosmic forces outside our chain outside our solar system." [...] Thus according to Leadbeater powers <b>of</b> <b>beings</b> <b>at</b> this level include omniscience regarding the events occurring on a single inhabited planet, materialization of large objects, {{and the ability to}} affect at a distance to some degree happenings in other nearby planetary systems.|$|R

Lee feigns familiarity, learning that Nick had visions <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>at</b> the epicenter of the quake before it began. When Lee reports this to Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) in the prime universe, she suddenly recalls her Cortexiphan trials including fellow subject Nick Lane, and with the team's help, identifies that other Cortexiphan subjects are the epicenter of these quakes, linking to their parallel universe versions to achieve synchronization.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to examine the phenomenon of the fear <b>of</b> <b>being</b> laughed <b>at.</b> Three groups of adults, preselected with respect to: (1) having no fear <b>of</b> <b>being</b> laughed <b>at,</b> (2) <b>being</b> borderline with respect to the fear <b>of</b> <b>being</b> laughed <b>at,</b> and (3) <b>being</b> abnormally afraid <b>of</b> <b>being</b> laughed <b>at</b> (gelotophobic). All the subjects listened to tape recordings of laughter. These recordings of laughter reflected a variety of emotional qualities. The subjects rated these recordings according to several criteria and estimated the emotional-motivational state of the laughing person. The subjects were also shown 20 cartoons depicting social situations that involved laughter or the potential <b>of</b> someone's <b>being</b> laughed <b>at</b> and were asked to stipulate what a target person in the cartoon would think or say. It was shown that gelotophobes experienced positively motivated laughter as more unpleasant than did subjects in the non-gelotophobic groups. The gelotophobic group was also more prone to estimate that the laughing person {{was in a state of}} negative affect. Those with no fear of laughter and those on the borderline experienced an increase in mood level after the laughter perception task whereas the gelotophobes remained unaffected. Finally, in the semi-projective cartoon evaluation task, the gelotophobes gave more answers that expressed mockery and fear <b>of</b> <b>being</b> laughed <b>at</b> than the other subjects. The results of these experiments show that anomalies relating to individual subjects' degrees of fear of laughter (gelotophobia) exist and can be predicted by the measures describe...|$|R

40|$|In {{observations}} from clinical practice, {{the origin of}} gelotophobia, the fear <b>of</b> <b>being</b> laughed <b>at,</b> was traced back to traumatizing experiences <b>of</b> <b>being</b> laughed <b>at</b> in childhood. Because gelotophobia {{is assumed to be}} mediated by a personal sense of shame, this hypothesis was tested using a group of gelotophobes (N = 99), a shame-based clinical group (N = 103), a non shame-based clinical group (N = 166), and normal controls (N = 495). While gelotophobes and the shame-based group reported having had more traumatizing experiences than the normal controls and the non shame-based group, their intensity and frequency did not explain individual differences in the fear <b>of</b> <b>being</b> laughed <b>at</b> for gelotophobes and the shame-based group...|$|R

25|$|The pontificate of Pope Pius XI {{was marked}} by great {{diplomatic}} activity and the issuance of many important papers, often {{in the form of}} encyclicals. In diplomatic affairs, Pius was aided at first by Pietro Gasparri and after 1930 by Eugenio Pacelli (who succeeded him as Pope Pius XII). Cardinal Gasparri's masterpiece was the Lateran Treaty (1929), negotiated for the Vatican by Francesco Pacelli. Nevertheless, the Fascist government and the pope were in open disagreement over the restriction of youth activities; this culminated in a strong papal letter (Non abbiamo bisogno, 1931), arguing the impossibility <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>at</b> once a Fascist and a Catholic. Relations between Mussolini and the Holy See were cool ever after.|$|E
25|$|Indian {{pitches and}} attitudes have changed {{considerably}} {{in the past}} few years though. The induction of several newer 'green top' venues (such as the ones at Mohali and at Dharamshala), the emergence of Indian fast bowlers, plus the development of domestic league cricket with international participants in the form of IPL, Ranji Trophy, ICL, have resulted in a greater variety of pitches. Some contemporary pitches provide good support for pace, bounce, and swing, giving visiting teams from countries such as South Africa and Australia the feeling <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>at</b> home. Surfaces are often tailor made to be flat tops or excessively batsmen-friendly, for the sake of maximising entertainment value, at the expense of all types of bowlers. But at time the reverse is true especially in the IPL wherein pace heavy teams often come-up with green pace friendly pitches to maximise chances of victory.|$|E

The experiment proves the possibility, but Juror 5 steps up and demonstrates the correct way to hold and use a switchblade; revealing that anyone skilled with a switchblade, as the boy would be, would always stab underhanded at an upwards angle against an opponent who was taller than they, as the grip of stabbing downwards would be too awkward and the act of changing hands too time-consuming.|$|E
