[...] (This point was not made {{for a very long}} time, hence the nature of informal logic remained opaque, even to those involved in it, for a period <b>of</b> <b>time.)</b> <b>Here</b> it is helpful to have recourse to Barth and Krabbe (1982:14f) where they distinguish three senses of the term [...] "form." [...] By [...] "form1," [...] Barth and Krabbe mean the sense of the term which derives from the Platonic idea of form—the ultimate metaphysical unit. Barth and Krabbe claim that most traditional logic is formal in this sense. That is, syllogistic logic is a logic of terms where the terms could naturally be understood as place-holders for Platonic (or Aristotelian) forms. In this first sense of [...] "form," [...] almost all logic is informal (not-formal). Understanding informal logic this way would be much too broad to be useful.|$|E

6000|$|I was astounded, {{to use a}} mild term, by {{the idea}} that we were to hold this Tory a {{prisoner}} for any length <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> <b>Here</b> we were, shut up within the British lines, in danger at any moment of being haled before some high mightiness of an officer to answer to the charge of being rebels, or of being in the town with evil intent, and we took it upon ourselves to capture a lad who stood to a certain degree in the favor of our enemies! ...|$|E

In the rear of the approaching tempest, brightened forth again the sunny splendor, which its progress had darkened with so terrible a frown.|$|E

60|$|And now {{came the}} terror. All of this {{enormous}} city was dead. Had it stood upon the moon {{it could not}} have been more dead. None paced its streets; none looked from its window-places. None trafficked in its markets, none worshipped in its temple. Swept, garnished, lighted, practically untouched by the hand <b>of</b> <b>Time,</b> <b>here</b> where no rains fell and no winds blew, it was yet a howling wilderness. For what wilderness is there to equal that which once has been the busy haunt of men? Let those who have stood among the buried cities of Central Asia, or of Anarajapura in Ceylon, or even amid the ruins of Salamis on the coast of Cyprus, answer the question. But here was something infinitely more awful. A huge human haunt in the bowels of the earth utterly devoid of human beings, and yet as perfect as on the day when these ceased to be.|$|E

[...] Although the learned Fa-hien asserts that [...] "it exists, and the same thing is true about it at the present day," [...] the various cavalry reconnaissances failed to discover it, and we must regretfully conclude that it has also been obliterated by the tides <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> <b>Here</b> too, says this Buddhistic Baedeker, is still to be seen the rock on which [...] "He dried his clothes; and the place where He converted the wicked dragon (Naga)."

60|$|One {{could say}} about this barn, what could hardly be said of either the church or the castle, akin to it in age and style, that the purpose which had {{dictated}} its original erection was the same with that to which it was still applied. Unlike and superior to either of those two typical remnants of mediævalism, the old barn embodied practices which had suffered no mutilation at the hands <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> <b>Here</b> at least {{the spirit of the}} ancient builders was at one with the spirit of the modern beholder. Standing before this abraded pile, the eye regarded its present usage, the mind dwelt upon its past history, with a satisfied sense of functional continuity throughout--a feeling almost of gratitude, and quite of pride, at the permanence of the idea which had heaped it up. The fact that four centuries had neither proved it to be founded on a mistake, inspired any hatred of its purpose, nor given rise to any reaction that had battered it down, invested this simple grey effort of old minds with a repose, if not a grandeur, which a too curious reflection was apt to disturb in its ecclesiastical and military compeers. For once mediævalism and modernism had a common stand-point. The lanceolate windows, the time-eaten archstones and chamfers, the orientation of the axis, the misty chestnut work of the rafters, referred to no exploded fortifying art or worn-out religious creed. The defence and salvation of the body by daily bread is still a study, a religion, and a desire.|$|E
