40|$|Abstract. Hardware Transactional Memory (HTM) gives {{software}} de-velopers {{the opportunity}} to write parallel programs more easily compared to any previous programming method, and yields better performance than most previous lock-based synchronizations. Current implementations of HTM perform very well with small transac-tions. But when a transaction overflows the cache, these implementations either abort the transaction as unsuitable for HTM, and let software takeover, or revert to some much more inefficient hash-like in-memory structure, usually located in the userspace. We present a fast, scalable solution that has virtually no limit on trans-action size, has low transactional read and write <b>overhead,</b> <b>works</b> with physical addresses, and doesn't require any changes inside the cache sub-system. This paper presents an HTMOS- Operating System (OS) and Architec-ture modifications that leverage the existing OS Virtual Memory mecha-nisms, to support unbounded transaction sizes, and provide transaction execution speed that does not decrease when transaction grows...|$|E

High reliability implies repeatable results, and precise and credible methods. Conversely, measurement error and subject variability can lead to low reliability of measures. The results indicated that ratings of perceived discomfort (RPD) parameters (slope and final rating) showed relatively high reliability.

40|$|The Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE) is an {{evaluation}} tool {{used in the}} return to work process to guide treatment and decision making. An FCE involves testing the functional abilities of an individual to determine their return to work readiness. A patient’s maximum capacity and functional abilities are determined either through subjective measures of exertion or visual observations of mechanics. Even though the observational method is more objective and reliable, descriptions of kinematics to guide evaluations are limited. Therefore, {{the main purpose of}} this investigation is to provide a comprehensive description of the kinematics of the upper extremity of a healthy population during upper extremity focused FCE tasks. 	Upper limb and torso kinematic data were collected on 30 young, healthy participants as they performed five FCE tasks (repetitive reaching, fingertip dexterity, hand and forearm dexterity, waist to overhead lift, and <b>overhead</b> <b>work).</b> Kinematic profiles were created for all clinically relevant angles of the torso, shoulder, elbow, and wrist. Segment velocities were also calculated for each task. 	Sex did not influence kinematics or segment velocity, but intensity changes resulted in significant differences for both measures. For example, in the waist to overhead lift, maximum torso extension increased by 10. 44 ° and minimum humeral flexion decreased by 11. 35 ° and 12. 07 ° for the right and left arm, respectively. During the <b>overhead</b> <b>work</b> task, mean torso extension increased by 6. 90 ° and mean internal rotation of the right and left humerus increased by 13. 58 ° and 14. 26 °, respectively. Segment velocities also increased by up to 50 % during the waist to overhead lift and up to 82 % in the <b>overhead</b> <b>work</b> task. 	The results of this study indicate many of these tasks require large ranges of motion and high demand postures for the upper limb, specifically for the shoulder and wrist. The reaching and dexterity tasks often required up to 60 ° of arm elevation, while the overhead tasks required arm elevation consistently greater than 90 °. Additionally, for several tasks in this investigation, wrist extension and ulnar deviation angles remained around 20 °, which is {{a large portion of the}} available range of motion of the wrist. Conversely, torso postures were almost always less than 30 ° away neutral and the elbow often remained within 60 °- 100 ° of flexion, the strongest elbow position, indicating the FCE tasks may not be as useful for evaluating these angles, but they should still closely monitored for potential compensations used by injured patients. 	The typical torso and upper limb kinematic profiles provided in this investigation is largest dataset of its kind to date. Clinicians and scientists will find the profiles useful because they provide a baseline to which motion can be compared to in order to better evaluate FCE performance. These data also improve the identification of a safe maximum capacity for overhead lifting and prolong <b>overhead</b> <b>work</b> tasks, allowing evaluators to better understand each patient’s abilities. This work supports the more ambitious future clinical goal of being able to identify people who are at risk of further injury or disability if returned to work too early...|$|R

40|$|Many {{industrial}} workplaces involve {{tasks that}} require {{work to be}} performed in overhead postures. Epidemiological evidence suggests that working in these unavoidable, awkward postures leads to development of shoulder fatigue, pain and several musculoskeletal disorders. The accumulation of localized muscle fatigue has been strongly associated {{with the development of}} work-related musculoskeletal injuries (Armstrong et al., 1993). In order to prevent injury, minimizing muscular fatigue during short-cycled, repetitive work through different work organization schemes has been suggested (Dempsey et al., 2010). Previous research has examined the interactive effect of altering contraction level, duty cycle and cycle times on shoulder muscle fatigue. However, isolation of one factor while maintaining a constant workload has not been examined for <b>overhead</b> <b>work</b> tasks. The {{purpose of the study was}} to determine whether cycle time affected the progression of fatigue at the shoulder since the postural load during overhead tasks is inherently fatiguing. Ten university aged females performed a task rotation between an intermittent overhead pressing task and a neutrally located assembly task. Four conditions were defined by cycle time (15 s, 30 s, 60 s and 120 s) and each cycle consisted of one complete rotation. In order to quantify the progression of fatigue over time, four dependant measures were systematically collected for all conditions until exhaustion or to a maximum of three hours. These included root mean square (RMS) amplitude and median power frequency (MdPF) calculated from surface electromyography of nine muscles surrounding the shoulder, static strength capability, and rating of perceived exertion. Endurance time was also included as a fifth measure of fatigue. Linear regression was used to determine the slope of static strength and perceived exertion over time, and magnitude changes over normalized time were calculated for EMG measures. For all dependant measures, repeated measures ANOVA were used to identify significant differences across conditions. As the only independent factor investigated, cycle time influenced two out of the five dependent measures. Conditions induced differences in endurance time (F[3, 24]= 3. 96, p= 0. 02) and RMS amplitude of the middle (F[24, 189]= 3. 10, p< 0. 0001) and posterior deltoid (F[24, 189]= 2. 52, p= 0. 0003). Performing <b>overhead</b> <b>work</b> in long cycles (120 s) induced a shorter average endurance time (118. 67 min), and the shortest cycle time (15 s) resulted in a longer average endurance time (152. 44 min). Over time, the rate of increase in RMS amplitude of both deltoid muscles was higher when working at the longest cycle time (120 s). Although six muscles showed an indication of fatigue through significant decreases in MdPF in at least one condition, cycle time did not affect MdPF over time for any muscle examined. Similarly, the rate of static strength capability and rating of perceived exertion over time were not affected by cycle time. Two of five measures indicated that cycle time played a significant role in fatigue progression, making its effectiveness as a work organizational method for <b>overhead</b> <b>work</b> tasks unclear. Results indicate that that intermittent <b>overhead</b> <b>work</b> should be performed in shorter cycles to reduce the risk of shoulder injury. Identifying additional effects of cycle time on fatigue measures through increasing statistical power would provide ergonomists with more confidence in recommending this organizational strategy to mitigate the risk of musculoskeletal injury...|$|R

Recently, work ability and functional capacity have been included as important risk measures in WHS. In order to address work ability appropriately, knowledge of associations with work and health measures is necessary. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate which of the factors measured in a WHS are independently associated with work ability in a group of meat processing workers. Methods A cross-sectional study was performed in a large meat processing company in The Netherlands. Data were collected during a WHS between February 2012 and March 2014. Personal characteristics, health habits and health-risk indicators, functional capacity, and work-related factors were measured. Work ability was measured with the Work Ability Index and was used as dependent variable. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted, a receiver operating characteristic curve was constructed and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. Results Data sets from 230 employees were used for analyses. The average age was 53 years and the average work ability index score was 39. 3. In the final multivariable model age (OR 0. 94), systolic blood pressure (OR 1. 03), need for recovery (OR 0. 56), and <b>overhead</b> <b>work</b> capacity (OR 3. 95) contributed significantly. The AUC for this model was 0. 81 (95 % CI 0. 75 - 0. 86).

40|$|To {{explore the}} spinal loads {{occurring}} in overhead working postures {{and to assess}} the value of ergonomic reduction of lumbar extension, spinal strain was measured by stature change in simulated motor vehicle maintenance tasks. A field study identified the typical extent of lumbar extension incurred {{in this type of}} work. In the laboratory eight male volunteers tightened and loosened bolts both overhead and at chest-height for 30 min periods; records were made of lumbar posture, ground reaction force, and perceived exertion. Stature change was measured using a refined technique which permitted estimation of net effect of the work loads. The field study revealed that motor mechanics typically spent 8 % of their time working overhead with up to 10 ° of lumbar extension. In the laboratory study, the overhead task entailed more lumbar extension and perceived exertion than did the chest-height task; ground reaction forces did not differ substantially between tasks. Only small changes in stature were observed {{at the end of the}} work period, and there was no significant difference between the tasks (means: overhead, + 0. 61 mm; chest-height, - 0. 23 mm: p = 0. 31). Stature change was significantly correlated with lordosis for <b>overhead</b> <b>work</b> such that increased lordosis (compared with chest-height work) was associated with relative stature gain. No evidence was found to indicate a need for ergonomic intervention in <b>overhead</b> <b>work</b> tasks so far as spinal loading is concerned.
