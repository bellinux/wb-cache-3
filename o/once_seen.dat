5|$|Attempts {{were now}} made {{to find a}} role for the {{remaining}} 19 locomotives. By now many had been relegated to hauling trains in what were <b>once</b> <b>seen</b> as remote outposts of the LMS. Often they were reduced to pulling stopping trains, empty stock trains, or even goods trains. Only one realistic mainline role was contemplated: to replace the Scottish Region A4 Class on the testing route between Edinburgh Waverley and Aberdeen. This idea was discarded largely {{because it would be}} excessively problematic to train the A4 crews to operate the Coronations. With no credible role, only one option remained: in July 1964 it was resolved that the remaining 19 locomotives were to be withdrawn from 12 September.|$|E
5|$|The Peasants' Revolt {{has been}} widely studied by academics. Late 19th-century historians used a range of sources from {{contemporary}} chroniclers to assemble {{an account of the}} uprising, and these were supplemented in the 20th century by research using court records and local archives. Interpretations of the revolt have shifted over the years. It was <b>once</b> <b>seen</b> as a defining moment in English history, but modern academics are less certain of its impact on subsequent social and economic history. The revolt heavily influenced the course of the Hundred Years' War, by deterring later Parliaments from raising additional taxes to pay for military campaigns in France. The revolt {{has been widely}} used in socialist literature, including by the author William Morris, and remains a potent political symbol for the political left, informing the arguments surrounding the introduction of the Community Charge in the United Kingdom during the 1980s.|$|E

5|$|The red-billed tropicbird usually nests on {{isolated}} cliff faces, {{in loose}} colonies. It uses a simple scrape nest, {{located in a}} place it can easily take off from. The age of first breeding is usually five years, although this age is variable; a three-year-old tropicbird was <b>once</b> <b>seen</b> breeding. In some locations, breeding happens year-round, while in others, breeding occurs seasonally. For example, for islands in the California Current, breeding starts in November or December, while it occurs year-round in the Galapagos. Breeding {{is influenced by the}} availability of food, with an increase in food generally causing an increase in breeding. Individually, this bird only breeds every nine to twelve months. A breeding bird usually returns to its partner and nest location from the previous breeding cycle.|$|E
5|$|The symphony had {{established}} itself {{by the end}} of the 18th century as the most prestigious of instrumental genres. While the genre had been developed with considerable intensity throughout that century and appeared in a wide range of occasions, it was generally used as an opening or closing work; in between would be works that included vocal and instrumental soloists. Because of its lack of written text for focus, it was seen as a vehicle for entertainment rather than for social, moral or intellectual ideas. As the symphony grew in size and artistic significance, thanks in part to efforts in the form by Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven, it also amassed greater prestige. A concurrent change in attitude toward instrumental music in general also took place, and the lack of text, <b>once</b> <b>seen</b> as a handicap, became considered a virtue.|$|E
5|$|The Middle Woodland Indians {{of eastern}} Iowa participated {{at the edge}} of the Havana and Hopewell {{interaction}} networks. This cultural connection to the East is seen in the construction of large mounds, earthworks, and the trade of exotic goods over very long distances. There were several large earthwork enclosures in Iowa along the Mississippi that date to the Middle Woodland period, but none in the interior of the state, indicating Iowa is the western edge of Havana-Hopewell influence. The Toolesboro Mound Group in Louisa County included a large octagonal earthen enclosure that covered several acres; earthworks of this style are indicative of the monumental construction <b>once</b> <b>seen</b> in Havana, Illinois along the Illinois River and sites in the Ohio River drainage including Chillicothe and Newark, Ohio. Hopewell trading networks were quite extensive, with obsidian from the Yellowstone area, copper from Lake Superior, and shells from the Gulf Coast appearing in Middle Woodland Iowa sites. Sites in eastern Iowa appeared to nucleate, vacating much of the hinterlands. Western Iowa appears to have been not directly involved in this exchange network, and the Havana-Hopewell flourishing did not extend much above the Kansas City area of the Missouri River.|$|E

5|$|The {{preservation}} of various pure breeds and strains, including {{some that are}} rare today, was once undertaken in North America {{in large part by}} large agriculture-focused colleges and universities. However, many of these institutions have changed their focus to commercial or crossbred strains, with many herds being sent to slaughter. The Livestock Conservancy and Rare Breeds Canada intervened in some of these cases, leading to the survival and {{preservation of}} some gene stocks. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) participates in livestock preservation mainly through technology-based approaches such as gene mapping and germplasm (genetic material) storage. However, although the storage of genetic material is a useful technique in the preservation of rare breeds, it cannot preserve the entire range of genetic diversity within even an individual breed, and stored material cannot react and adapt to environmental or biological changes as live animal populations can. The US federal government rarely supports rare breed live animal population conservation, and while agricultural subsidies were <b>once</b> <b>seen</b> more than they are in present times, they were never focused on individual breeds. The Livestock Conservancy has been instrumental in preserving live populations of many rare livestock breeds in the US.|$|E

Christmas tree farming was <b>once</b> <b>seen</b> only as a viable alternative for low-quality farmland, but that perception has changed within the agriculture industry. For optimum yield and quality, land should be flat or gently rolling and relatively free of debris and undergrowth.|$|E
25|$|Yeltsin's {{personal}} and health problems received {{a great deal}} of attention in the global press.

He made frequent stays at the nearby government sanatorium in Barvikha.|$|E
25|$|Eogavialis {{has often}} been {{proposed}} to be non-tomistomine due to its lack of supposedly crocodylid synapomorphies needed {{in order for a}} taxon to be placed within Tomistominae. The genus lacks the exposure of the vomer on the palate that has been viewed as a characteristic of tomistomines. The trend for a long, narrow rostrum developing progressively over time as seen in Eogavialis has been used to suggest that the genus was a direct ancestor of Gavialis. Gryposuchus was <b>once</b> <b>seen</b> as phylogenetically between Eogavialis and Gavialis.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the battle, British ships {{experienced}} {{difficulties with}} communications, whereas the Germans {{did not suffer}} such problems. The British preferred signalling using ship-to-ship flag and lamp signals, avoiding wireless, whereas the Germans used wireless successfully. One conclusion drawn was that flag signals were not a satisfactory way to control the fleet. Experience using lamps, particularly at night when issuing challenges to other ships, demonstrated this was {{an excellent way to}} advertise your precise location to an enemy, inviting a reply by gunfire.

25|$|While {{the canal}} was <b>once</b> <b>seen</b> {{as a tool}} of production, trade, and {{commerce}} it is now considered to be architectural and technical heritage as evidenced by the refusal of the mayor of Toulouse Pierre Baudis to allow space on the Canal du Midi to be used for an urban expressway. However, it has not been downgraded and remains open for navigation. On 7 December 1996 the channel and a buffer zone of 2,000kmÂ² were included in the list of World Heritage Sites by UNESCO. In the same year, it was classified under French law as a Grand Site of France. This classification was extended to the canals of the plain and the mountain in 1996 and 2001. It caused a very rapid increase in tourist numbers.|$|E
