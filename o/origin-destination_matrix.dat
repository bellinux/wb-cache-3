In this paper, we investigate problems of dynamic identification of <b>origin-destination</b> <b>matrices</b> when traffic counts are unavailable in some entrances and/or exits of a traffic system. To deal with non-linearity and inestimability problems in conventional research frameworks., identification problems with incomplete information are reformulated as optimization problems with linear equality constraints and non-negative inequality constraints.

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} move away from more formal route-choice models and to avoid {{calibration}} issues, visually guided agent-based models have recently been introduced to microscopic urban models of pedestrian behavior. Although the new models produce good correlation between the agents and observed pedestrian movement, there are two problems with them. Firstly, the implementations have lacked an <b>origin-destination</b> <b>matrix,</b> and so the models work best in situations where undirected exploratory movement is likely to occur. Secondly, the models rely on precalculated visibility graphs to store visual data from locations within the system; these graphs use a large amount of computer memory. Here we show that a line of sight model using reduced visual information compares well with the destination selection method, and further, that the addition of a simple <b>origin-destination</b> <b>matrix</b> can lead to better agent correlation with pedestrian movement...|$|E

40|$|The {{existing}} crowd flow {{simulation models}} {{fall into two}} major categories: those based on space syntax theories, and those based on the vehicular micro-simulation models incorporating <b>origin-destination</b> <b>matrix.</b> The space-syntax based models have a unique strength {{in their ability to}} analyse the spatial geometry quickly and generating valuable information about the configuration of space. However it suffers from the exclusion of dynamic effects of flow that are driven by the needs of people to go from A to B. The origin-destination based models are fundamentally micro-simulation models that provide for these dynamic effects. These models provide the valuable information on interaction of agents and densities as a function of time. However these models tend to be complex, both in pre-processing and execution, and reliable information on space effectiveness is only available {{at the end of a}} number of simulation runs.

The cards are used like an {{automatic}} fare collection system by the different public transport companies. The fare collection is easier, faster and {{last but not least}} more efficient with this method. However the generated data are utilizable for other aims apart from the original aim. The <b>origin-destination</b> <b>matrix</b> {{plays a key role in}} a transport company's life. We may adapt to the travel demands efficiently in the knowledge of the matrix. Thanks to the proper service the passengers will be satisfied, and they use the service with pleasure. The additional benefit, that the unnecessary capacities can be forced back in the knowledge of the demand, and thereby the expenses of the service provider's decrease. The <b>origin-destination</b> <b>matrix</b> was able to create only with classical counting and interview methods till now. Their disadvantage, that the production consumes considerable workforce and time with a method like this, and hereby the costs are higher. The counting concern to a given time only and the sampling proportion compared to the number of travels of the year is quite slight. Because of that the distortion effect is considerable, the matrix cannot reflect the effects of an intervention. These effects get into the system only after the next counting. The penetration of the smart cards increases, the card user passengers’ number increases continuously. Thanks to that, not only the cost efficiency of the fare collection is growing, but at the same time the statistical sample size too. If more passengers from young persons to older ones accept the usage of the cards, we may receive more accurate picture about the transportation network. If the fare collection system was built up somewhere, the <b>origin-destination</b> <b>matrix</b> can be manufactured with lower expenses, and because of the continuous usage the matrix will be current always, the changes become traceable. We may know the demands in all the moments, the <b>origin-destination</b> <b>matrix</b> may change dynamically in function of the weather, time of the day, season and so on.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explore a new {{approach}} to obtain better traffic demand (<b>Origin-Destination,</b> OD <b>matrices)</b> for dense urban networks using traffic simulation data. From reviewing existing methods, from static to dynamic OD matrix evaluation, possible deficiencies in the approach could be identified. To improve the global process of traffic demand estimation, this paper is focusing on a new methodology to determine dynamic OD matrices for urban areas characterized by complex route choice situation and high level of traffic controls. An iterative bi-level approach will be used to perform the OD estimation. The Lower Level (traffic assignment) problem will determine, dynamically, the utilization of the network by vehicles using heuristic data from mesoscopic traffic simulator particularly adapted for urban context. The Upper Level (matrix adjustment) problem will proceed to an OD estimation using optimization least square techniques. In this way, a full dynamic and continuous estimation of the final OD matrix could be obtained. First evaluation of the proposed approach and conclusions are presented.

Numerical results show that the accuracy of estimates by the CRI algorithm is fairly good [...] the solutions obtained by the CRI are optimal in majority of the cases, while the computational efforts are very limited [...] increment mainly lies on the evaluation of an inverse for an mxm matrix (m= 4 for a typical intersection) compared with the ordinary recursive least squares method. These results mean that a properly designed recursive algorithm can indeed avoid iterative procedure in each time step to obtain highly accurate on-line estimates for intersection O-D matrices. Therefore, the CRI algorithm with its reasonable balance between accuracy and computational simplicity is very suitable for practical use. ...|$|R
