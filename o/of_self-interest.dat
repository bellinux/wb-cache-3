Rand asked this young woman to explain her goals in life.

Rand created Keating as an archetype of this motivation, which she saw as the opposite <b>of</b> <b>self-interest.</b>|$|E

As predicted, idiocentrism and masculinity significantly predicted the decision to pursue self-interests.

30|$|As the {{preceding}} considerations underline, {{there are a}} number of good reasons to acknowledge the fact that the expression and promotion <b>of</b> <b>self-interests</b> should not generally be excluded from deliberative discussions and that insisting on one’s own interests is not necessarily illegitimate and disrupting or even “contaminating” such discussions. To the contrary, the articulation <b>of</b> <b>self-interests</b> can even provide a source of legitimacy for public participation in democratic deliberation and decision-making. As noted above, this applies in particular to those cases in which the common interest is composed of the particular individual interests of all participants, or the interests of some social groups have been neglected by more powerful actors, or hegemonic definitions of the common good would go unchallenged as long as certain groups do not become aware of their opposing interests and fail to publicly articulate them.|$|R

25|$|The Jat power made rapid {{progress}} {{during his}} leadership. Essentially Machiavellian in approach, he could change postures {{to serve his}} end. An implacable rebel {{till the end of}} Aurangzeb’s reign, he later found it convenient to profess loyalty to the Mughal throne. In turn he, for the first time, gained the royal favours. But he reverted to his old ways and tried to fish in troubled waters during the reign of Farrukh Siyar. Efforts at his suppression were tried but failed and in the end Churaman received additional concessions. However, the concessions offered from a position of apparent helplessness defeated their very objective. Instead of making Churaman sincerely loyal, they made him conscious of his mischief potential and thus eventually whetted his contumacious designs. Side by side the dictates <b>of</b> <b>self-interest</b> drew him closer to the mighty Sayyids and the latter themselves, for reasons already explained extended their support to churaman to the point of infuriating Farrukh Siya. With the Emperor demanding his annihilation and the Wazir and the Mir Bakhshi offering him full protection, the Jat problem in general and Churaman’s case in particulars assumed interesting dimension.|$|E
25|$|I {{have further}} shown cause for the belief that direct selection, after the fashion of the {{horticulturist}} and the breeder, neither has played, nor can play, any important part {{in the evolution of}} society; apart from other reasons, because I do not see how such selection could be practiced without a serious weakening, it may be the destruction, of the bonds which hold society together. It strikes me that men who are accustomed to contemplate the active or passive extirpation of the weak, the unfortunate, and the superfluous; who justify that conduct on the ground that it has the sanction of the cosmic process, and is the only way of ensuring the progress of the race; who, if they are consistent, must rank medicine among the black arts and count the physician a mischievous preserver of the unfit; on whose matrimonial undertakings the principles of the stud have the chief influence; whose whole lives, therefore, are an education in the noble art of suppressing natural affection and sympathy, are not likely to have any large stock of these commodities left. But, without them, there is no conscience, nor any restraint on the conduct of men, except the calculation <b>of</b> <b>self-interest,</b> the balancing of certain present gratifications against doubtful future pains; and experience tells us how much that is worth. Every day, we see firm believers in the hell of the theologians commit acts by which, as they believe when cool, they risk eternal punishment; while they hold back from those which are opposed to the sympathies of their associates.|$|E

Second, we develop an alternative and more direct test <b>of</b> whether economic <b>self-interest</b> matters for people’s attitudes towards immigration.

25|$|The most {{controversial}} measure Caesar introduced was an agrarian bill to allot plots {{of land to}} the landless poor to farm. Conservative aristocrats had a tradition of vehemently opposing land redistribution and most such bills were not passed. In Cassius Dio’s opinion, Caesar tried to appear to promote {{the interests of the}} optimates {{as well as those of}} the people, and said that he would not introduce his land reform if they did not agree with it. He read the draft of the bill to the senate, asked for the option of each senator and promised to amend or scrap any clause that had raised objections. The optimates were annoyed because the bill, to their embarrassment, could not be criticised. Moreover, it would give Caesar popularity and power. Even though no optimate spoke against it, no one expressed approval. The law would distribute public and private land to all citizens instead of just Pompey’s veterans and would do so without any expense for the city or any loss for the optimates. It would be financed with the proceeds from Pompey’s war booty and the new tributes and taxes in the east Pompey established with his victories in the Third Mithridatic War. Private land was to be bought at the price assessed in the tax-lists to ensure fairness. The land commission in charge of the allocations would be large and have twenty members so that it would not be small commission run by a clique and many men would share the honour. Caesar added that it would be run by the most suitable men. This was an invitation to the optimates to apply for these posts. He ruled himself out of the commission to avoid suggestions that he proposed the measure out <b>of</b> <b>self-interest</b> and said that he was happy with being just the proposer of the law. The senators kept delaying the vote. Cato advocated the status quo. Caesar came to the point of having him dragged out of the senate house and arrested. Cato said that he was up for this and many senators followed suit and left. Caesar adjourned the session of the senate and decided that since the senate was not willing to pass a preliminary decree he would get the plebeian council to vote. He did not convene the senate for the rest of his consulship and proposed motions directly to the plebeian council. Cassius Dio thought Caesar proposed the bill as a favour to Pompey and Crassus.|$|E

500|$|Benedict de Spinoza in his Ethics, {{published}} {{after his}} death in 1677, argued that most people, even those that consider themselves to exercise free will, make moral decisions on the basis of imperfect sensory information, inadequate understanding of their mind and will, as well as emotions which are both outcomes of their contingent physical existence and forms of thought defective from being chiefly impelled by self-preservation. The solution, according to Spinoza, was to gradually increase the capacity of our reason to change the forms of thought produced by emotions and {{to fall in love with}} viewing problems requiring moral decision from the perspective of eternity. Thus, living a life of peaceful conscience means to Spinoza that reason is used to generate adequate ideas where the mind increasingly sees the world and its conflicts, our desires and passions sub specie aeternitatis, that is without reference to time. Hegel's obscure and mystical Philosophy of Mind held that the absolute right of freedom of conscience facilitates human understanding of an all-embracing unity, an absolute which was rational, real and true. Nevertheless, Hegel thought that a functioning State would always be tempted not to recognize conscience in its form of subjective knowledge, just as similar non-objective opinions are generally rejected in science. A similar idealist notion was expressed in the writings of Joseph Butler who argued that conscience is God-given, should always be obeyed, is intuitive, and should be considered the [...] "constitutional monarch" [...] and the [...] "universal moral faculty": [...] "conscience does not only offer itself to show us the way we should walk in, but it likewise carries its own authority with it." [...] Butler advanced ethical speculation by referring to a duality of regulative principles in human nature: first,"self-love" [...] (seeking individual happiness) and second, [...] "benevolence" [...] (compassion and seeking good for another) in conscience (also linked to the agape of situational ethics). Conscience tended to be more authoritative in questions of moral judgment, thought Butler, because it was more likely to be clear and certain (whereas calculations <b>of</b> <b>self-interest</b> tended to probable and changing conclusions). John Selden in his Table Talk expressed the view that an awake but excessively scrupulous or ill-trained conscience could hinder resolve and practical action; it being [...] "like a horse that is not well wayed, he starts at every bird that flies out of the hedge".|$|E
