[...] Many physicians have reported changes in their dispensing practices; a reluctance to risk <b>over-prescribing</b> pain medication may have led to under-prescribing. [...] Death certification practices were altered as well. Perhaps the largest change was the movement from single-doctor general practices to multiple-doctor general practices. This was not a direct recommendation, but rather because the report stated that there was not enough safeguarding and monitoring of doctors' decisions.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{examine the}} non-biomedical reasons which make family doctors <b>over-prescribe</b> {{antibiotics}} for {{upper respiratory tract}} infection (URTI) in a mixed private/public Asian setting. Methods: The questionnaire {{was sent to the}} members of the Hong Kong College of Family Physicians between August and December 2001. Results: A total of 801 family doctors completed a postal questionnaire with an overall response rate of 65. 0 %. A significant number of respondents (21. 8 %) felt they might be prescribing antibiotics too often for URTI but the majority of them felt they were using antibiotics just a bit too often. Doctors who were older, more senior or in private practice were more likely to feel that they might be prescribing antibiotics too often. More than 50 % of respondents thought that to satisfy the patient or his/her carer and fear of medicolegal problem if the patient deteriorates would make them very likely or likely to <b>over-prescribe</b> antibiotics for patients with URTIs. Public doctors might <b>over-prescribe</b> in order to save time, whereas private doctors might do so in order to keep patients in their practice. Conclusion: The results showed that doctors with certain characteristics are more likely to overprescribe antibiotics. Factors, other than biomedical ones, may play important roles in doctor's prescription of antibiotics for URTI. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

The Bureau has established a data-sharing agreement with the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety (DPS) to cross-check the state-issued identification cards with those maintained by DPS.|$|E
50|$|Because of opioid drugs' {{reputation}} for addiction and fatal overdose, most are controlled substances. In 2013, between 28 and 38 million people used opioids illicitly (0.6% to 0.8% {{of the global}} population {{between the ages of}} 15 and 65). In 2011, an estimated 4 million people in the United States used opioids recreationally or were dependent on them. Current increased rates of recreational use and addiction are attributed to over-prescription of opioid medications and inexpensive illicit heroin. Conversely, fears about <b>over-prescribing,</b> exaggerated side effects and addiction from opioids are similarly blamed for under-treatment of pain.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, the US {{government}} began {{cracking down on}} pharmacists and doctors who were <b>over-prescribing</b> opioid pain killers. The unintended consequence of this was that users turned to cheaper but illegal heroin, a significantly more potent opioid, as a substitute, including addicted patients who were denied opioid prescriptions as doctors tried to cut back painkiller drug abuse. A 2017 survey in Utah of heroin users found about 80 percent started with prescription drugs. As a result, by 2015 nationwide deaths from prescription opioids had increased by 15% and for heroin users by 23%.|$|E

The Rolleston defined addiction as an individualised pathology, whilst the second Brain report explicitly described the condition as a socially infectious one. It recommended the establishment of special treatment centres, especially in the London area, where addicts could be isolated from the community and treated. These became known as Drug Dependency Units, or DDUs.|$|E

Bing Spear was employed by the Home Office Drugs Branch from 1952-1986 and was its Chief Inspector from 1977. He was unusual for the time (maybe even today) for a civil servant in that he had an [...] approach to both the addicts and the doctors who treated them.

40|$|Unnecessary {{antibiotic}} use in {{the community}} is a major driver {{for the development of}} resistant bacterial carriage. Despite the self-limiting nature of most acute respiratory tract infections (RTIs), a substantial proportion of consultations in the community result in an antibiotic prescription. Clinicians <b>over-prescribe</b> antibiotics partly because non-antibiotic management might result in more complications, and because more serious infections can initially present innocuously. 4 This study explored whether the incidence of specific infective complications was higher in patients registered with general practices that prescribed fewer antibiotics for self-limiting RTIs...|$|R
50|$|Psychiatry's history {{involves}} {{what some}} view as dangerous treatments. Electroconvulsive therapy {{is one of}} these, which was used widely between the 1930s and 1960s and is still in use today. The brain surgery procedure lobotomy is another practice that was ultimately seen as too invasive and brutal. In the US, between 1939 and 1951, over 50,000 lobotomy operations were performed in mental hospitals. Valium and other sedatives have arguably been <b>over-prescribed,</b> leading to a claimed epidemic of dependence. Concerns also exist for the significant increase in prescription of psychiatric drugs to children.|$|R
50|$|Even more harmful {{than this}} {{physical}} oppression {{is the use}} and abuse of psychiatric tools. The rampant diagnoses of ADD and similar conditions are shown to be intimately connected to pharmaceutical companies’ promotional activities. The alleged disorder known as ODD - oppositional defiance disorder - is used to further control kids by serving as a gateway for further authoritative measures, often of the extreme kind. Ritalin and other drugs are being <b>over-prescribed.</b> These strong drugs can have harmful consequences, including suicide and murder. Some school shooters, including the Columbine killers, have used or been on these drugs.|$|R
50|$|Undertreatment {{may be due}} to physicians' fear {{of being}} accused of <b>over-prescribing</b> (see for {{instance}} the case of Dr William Hurwitz), despite the relative rarity of prosecutions, or physicians' poor understanding of the health risks attached to opioid prescription As a result of two recent cases in California though, where physicians who failed to provide adequate pain relief were successfully sued for elder abuse, the North American medical and health care communities appear to be undergoing a shift in perspective. The California Medical Board publicly reprimanded the physician in the second case; the federal Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services has declared a willingness to charge with fraud health care providers who accept payment for providing adequate pain relief while failing to do so; and clinical practice guidelines and standards are evolving into clear, unambiguous statements on acceptable pain management, so health care providers, in California at least, can no longer avoid culpability by claiming that poor or no pain relief meets community standards.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{study the}} {{reconstruction}} of the missing thermal and mechanical fields on an inaccessible part of the boundary for two-dimensional linear isotropic thermoelastic materials from <b>over-prescribed</b> noisy (Cauchy) data on the remaining accessible boundary. This problem is solved with the method of fundamental solutions (MFS) together with the method of particular solutions (MPS) via the MFS-based particular solution for two-dimensional problems in uncoupled thermoelasticity developed in Marin and Karageorghis (2012 a, 2013). The stabilisation/regularization of this inverse problem is achieved by using the Tikhonov regularization method (Tikhonov and Arsenin, 1986), whilst the optimal value of the regularization parameter is selected by employing Hansen’s L-curve method (Hansen, 1998) ...|$|R

Indications {{for the use of}} systemic antibiotics in dentistry are limited, since most dental and periodontal diseases are best managed by operative intervention and oral hygiene measures. However, the literature provides evidence of inadequate prescribing practices by dentists, due to a number of factors ranging from inadequate knowledge to social factors. Here we review studies that investigated the pattern of antibiotic use by dentists worldwide. The main defects in the knowledge of antibiotic prescribing are outlined. The main conclusion is that, unfortunately, the prescribing practices of dentists are inadequate and this is manifested by <b>over-prescribing.</b> Recommendations to improve antibiotic prescribing practices are presented in an attempt to curb the increasing incidence of antibiotic resistance and other side effects of antibiotic abuse.
