40|$|The {{regulatory}} {{region of}} the rat preproglucagon gene targets expression of the SV 40 large T oncoprotein to two cell types in transgenic mice, the pancreatic alpha cells {{and a set of}} neurons localized in the hindbrain, both <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>normally</b> <b>produce</b> preproglucagon. Additional neurons in the forebrain and midbrain stain for T antigen but do not express the endogenous glucagon gene. Synthesis of T antigen in endocrine alpha cells results in the heritable development of pancreatic glucagonomas. In brains of transgenic mice from three independent lineages, expression of the hybrid gene begins at embryonic day 12 in neuroblasts of the hindbrain, where it continues throughout adult life, most notably in the medulla. Remarkably, oncoprotein expression in both proliferating neuroblasts and mature neurons has no apparent consequences, either phenotypic or tumorigenic. Expression of the hybrid glucagon gene in both neurons and islet cells supports a possible interrelationship between these cell types...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Studies of the {{biosynthesis}} of aminocyclitol antibiotics, especially neomycin, {{have led}} to development of the mutasynthetic technique for the preparation of related antibiotics. A specific type of mutant strain <b>of</b> the microorganism <b>which</b> <b>normally</b> <b>produces</b> the aminocyclitol antibiotic is first prepared. The mutant sought is one unable to produce the aminocyclitol subunit and thus it can produce the normal antibiotic only {{in the presence of}} added native aminocyclitol. Alternatively, it can produce related (mutasynthetic) antibiotics in the presence of other aminocyclitols (mutasynthons). Mutasyn-thesis is not limited to aminocyclitol antibiotics but it has now been used to produce compounds related to essentially all of the clinically useful amino-cyclitol antibiotics. Not all potential mutasynthons are accepted by the mutants and some accepted lead to antibiotics more widely altered than by the simple substitution of a natural by an unnatural aminocyclitol. Thus, mutasynthesis has considerable potential {{in the study of the}} structural requirements for bioactivity as well as in the design of new antibiotics...|$|R

40|$|Organized {{behaviour}} requires central neural {{mechanisms to}} prevent the simultaneous occurrence of incompatible movements. We investigated neural pathways in crayfish that suppress slow flexion of the abdomen during rapid flexions ('tailflips') produced by a separate set of muscles. The slow flexors are innervated in each half segment of the abdomen by five motor neurones and one peripheral inhibitor. In isolated preparations of the abdominal nervous system, stimulation of identified command neurones, which trigger tailflips in intact animals, inhibited spontaneous activity in the motor neurones to the slow flexors and excited the peripheral inhibitor. These effects are mediated by a population of interganglionic intemeurones interposed between the command cells and the slow flexor efferents. Slow flexor reflexes also were inhibited by escape commands. This inhibi-tion includes pathways that act upon early stages of sensory input. As a result, habituation <b>of</b> reflexes, <b>which</b> <b>normally</b> is <b>produced</b> by repeated stimulation, is abolished if each sensory stimulus is preceded by a burst of impulses in the command neurone...|$|R
30|$|Results for the {{distribution}} of the categories of reaction products for the various alkanes (Table  2) indicate that, n-nonane and n-octane produced 100 % hydrocracking products at all temperatures studied while n-heptane and n-hexane produced hydroisomerisation products with a high selectivity (Table  2 and 3). A broad range of C 1 to C 6 products was found for n-nonane while n-octane produced C 1 to C 5 species. The presence of isobutanes, isopentanes and isohexanes among the reaction products suggests that the iso-nonanes and iso-octanes may have been produced initially but that these primary products underwent facile hydrocracking to give lighter alkanes. The test results using 2 -methyl heptane (Fig.  5) suggests that branched hydrocarbons are more reactive than n-alkanes. This is consistent with the findings that the activation energy required for n-octane was 110.38 compared to 100.11  kJ mol− 1 for 2 -methylheptane (Table  3). This indicates that isoalkanes are, at least for the longer alkanes, more active than the n-alkanes themselves and undergo rapid conversion, thereby severely limiting the selectivity to isomers that can be obtained at high conversions. Groten and Wojciechowski (1993) and De Lucas et al. (2005) have shown that n-nonane and n-octane are prone to hydrocracking (≥ 90 %) over metal supported zeolites at temperatures greater than 350  °C. At GHSV of 639 and 852  h− 1. Here, n-octane produced traces (~ 3 %) of 2, 2, 4 -trimethylpentane, the hydrocracking <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>normally</b> <b>produces</b> propane, butanes and pentanes. The higher space velocity reduced the extent of hydrocracking and shifted the reaction toward hydroisomerisation indicating again that hydrocracking resulted from conversion of primary isomerisation products. Reduced contact times and higher hydrogen partial pressure diminish the extent to which carbonaceous deposits are generated from oligomerisation and/or dehydrocyclisation reactions (Lungstein et al. 1999; Komatsu 2010). Hydroisomerisation of n-hexane and n-heptane produced 2, 2 -dimethylbutane and 2, 2 -dimethylpentane as the major respective reaction products with traces of monobranched isomers (Table  3). Selectivity to isohexanes was greater than selectivity to iso-heptanes at all the temperatures. n-Heptane produced methane, propane and butanes while n-hexane produced methane, propane and pentanes as the only hydrocracking species. Work by Hunter and East (2002) would suggest that the bond strengths of the central C–C for the C 6 to C 10 n-alkanes do not differ significantly and thus cannot be used to explain difference in behavior of the series. On the other hand, Brönsted acid mediated fission reactions involving the central C–C bonds become more favorable as chain length increases. This does not account, however, for the relative ease of activation of the shorter, compared with longer alkanes or the relative selectivities observed. It is clear that in order to account for both, isomerisation has to be favored, irrespective of chain length for all n-alkanes but with the shorter alkanes being more readily activated (Table  3), whereas the isomers formed are more stable for those derived from short chain alkanes and consequently undergo secondary reactions at a lesser rate. Work is ongoing to establish the contributions to the overall mechanism played by the residual sulfate on the zirconia and whether this carbided MoO 3 /SO 42 −–ZrO 2 system does operate as a truly bifunctional catalyst.|$|R

5000|$|To achieve {{energies}} {{high enough}} to create these particles, Rubbia, together with David Cline and Peter McIntyre, proposed a radically new particle accelerator design. They proposed to use a beam of protons and a beam of antiprotons, their antimatter twins, counter rotating in the vacuum pipe of the accelerator and colliding head-on. The idea of creating particles by colliding beams of more [...] "ordinary" [...] particles was not new: electron-positron and proton-proton colliders were already in use. However, by the late 1970s / early 1980s those could not approach the needed energies in the centre of mass to explore the W/Z region predicted by theory. At those energies, protons colliding with anti-protons were the best candidates, but how to obtain sufficiently intense (and well-collimated) beams <b>of</b> anti-protons, <b>which</b> are <b>normally</b> <b>produced</b> impinging a beam of protons on a fixed target? Van den Meer had in the meantime developed the concept of [...] "stochastic cooling", in which particles, like anti-protons could be kept in a circular array, and their beam divergence reduced progressively by sending signals to bending magnets downstream. Since decreasing the divergence of the beam meant to reduce transverse velocity or energy components, the suggestive term [...] "stochastic cooling" [...] {{was given to the}} scheme. The scheme could then be used to [...] "cool" [...] (to collimate) the anti-protons, which could thus be forced into a well-focused beam, suitable for acceleration to high energies, without losing too many anti-protons to collisions with the structure. Stochastic expresses the fact that signals to be taken resemble random noise, which was called [...] "Schottky noise" [...] when first encountered in vacuum tubes. Without van der Meer's technique, UA1 would never have had the sufficient high-intensity anti-protons it needed. Without Rubbia's realisation of its usefulness, stochastic cooling would {{have been the subject of}} a few publications and nothing else. Simon van de Meer developed and tested the technology in the proton Intersecting Storage Rings at CERN, but it is most effective on rather low intensity beams, such as the anti-protons which were prepared for use in the SPS when configured as a collider.|$|R

40|$|Teopod 2 (Tp 2) is a semidominant {{mutation}} {{of maize}} that prolongs {{the expression of}} juvenile vegetative traits, increases {{the total number of}} leaves produced by the shoot, and transforms reproductive structures into vegetative ones. Here, we show that Tp 2 prolongs the duration of vegetative growth without prolonging the overall duration of shoot growth. Mutant shoots produce leaves {{at the same rate as}} wild-type plants and continue to produce leaves after wild-type plants have initiated a tassel. Although Tp 2 /+ plants initiate a tassel later than their wild-type siblings, this mutant tassel ceases differentiation at the same time as, or shortly before, the primary meristem of a wild-type tassel completes its development. To investigate the relationship between the vegetative and reproductive development of the shoot, Tp 2 /+ and wild-type plants were exposed to floral inductive short day (SD) treatments at various stages of shoot growth. Tassel initiation in wild-type plants (<b>which</b> <b>normally</b> <b>produced</b> 18 to 19 leaves) was maximally sensitive to SD between plastochrons 15 and 16, whereas tassel branching was maximally sensitive to SD between plastochrons 15 and 18.
