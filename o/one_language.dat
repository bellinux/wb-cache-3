5|$|A 2007 {{study showed}} that 16% of Armenians born in Lebanon, 29% in Armenia (including Soviet Armenia), 31% in Iran and 36% in Turkey are not {{proficient}} in English. Many foreign-born Armenians are multilingual, speaking at least <b>one</b> <b>language</b> other than Armenian and English. For instance, Armenians from Armenia might know Russian, those from Lebanon and Syria may know Arabic and French, almost all Iranian Armenians speak Persian and Istanbul Armenians speak Turkish.|$|E
5|$|Cross-linguistically, the-ma suffix may {{be related}} to a coverbial suffix in Jaminjung, a {{language}} in which coverb roots occur without any aspect markers, but are then suffixed with -mayan, which marks continuous aspect. This coverb suffix bears a striking resemblance to the sum of the Wagiman -ma suffix and the continuous aspect suffix -yan, which always occur in tandem on coverbs. Together, -ma and -yan perform the same semantic function as Jaminjung -mayan. Precisely what the relationship holds between these suffixes; whether <b>one</b> <b>language</b> borrowed from the other, or whether each language inherited them from earlier languages, is not at all clear.|$|E

5|$|Fingerspelling {{is a form}} of borrowing, a {{linguistic}} process wherein words from <b>one</b> <b>language</b> are incorporated into another. In ASL, fingerspelling is used for proper nouns and for technical terms with no native ASL equivalent. There are also some other loan words which are fingerspelled, either very short English words or abbreviations of longer English words, e.g. O-N from English 'on', and A-P-T from English 'apartment'. Fingerspelling may also be used to emphasize a word that would normally be signed otherwise.|$|E
5|$|However, {{languages}} {{differ from}} biological organisms {{in that they}} readily incorporate elements from other languages {{through the process of}} diffusion, as speakers of different languages come into contact. Humans also frequently speak more than <b>one</b> <b>language,</b> acquiring their first language or languages as children, or learning new languages as they grow up. Because of the increased language contact in the globalizing world, many small languages are becoming endangered as their speakers shift to other languages that afford the possibility to participate in larger and more influential speech communities.|$|E

However, the different {{cultural and political}} views of its contributors led the publication to have undefined leanings. To maintain a neutral political position, the magazine published writings that covered numerous aspects of the political spectrum. In cultural discourse, the magazine published disagreeing polemics over the proper balance of Westernization and tradition necessary for the country's development.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, the {{languages}} most spoken at home among permanent residents aged 15 and older were Swiss German (60.1%), French (23.4%), Standard German (10.1%), and Italian (8.4%). More than two-fifths (42.6%) {{of the permanent}} resident population indicated speaking more than <b>one</b> <b>language</b> regularly. Other languages spoken at home included English (4.6%), Portuguese (3.5%), Albanian (2.6%), Serbian and Croatian (2.5%), Spanish (2.2%), and Turkish (1.3%).|$|E
5|$|Many {{of these}} forms of {{assimilation}} are still at work today. For example, when a central authority nationalizes <b>one</b> <b>language,</b> that attaches economic and social advantages to the prestige language. As generations pass, use of the indigenous language often fades or disappears, and linguistic and cultural identity recede as well. However, some groups are seeking to revive their indigenous identities. One important political aspect of this pursuit is petitioning the government for official recognition as a separate and distinct ethnic group.|$|E
5|$|The {{most widely}} taught foreign {{languages}} in the United States, {{in terms of}} enrollment numbers from kindergarten through university undergraduate studies, are: Spanish (around 7.2 million students), French (1.5 million), and German (500,000). Other commonly taught languages (with 100,000 to 250,000 learners) include Latin, Japanese, ASL, Italian, and Chinese. 18% of all Americans claim to speak at least <b>one</b> <b>language</b> in addition to English.|$|E

25|$|Similarly, {{countries}} which use a single spoken language throughout may {{have two or}} more sign languages, or an area that contains more than <b>one</b> spoken <b>language</b> might use only <b>one</b> sign <b>language.</b> South Africa, which has 11 official spoken languages and a similar number of other widely used spoken languages, {{is a good example}} of this. It has only <b>one</b> sign <b>language</b> with two variants due to its history of having two major educational institutions for the deaf which have served different geographic areas of the country.|$|R

5|$|Although the IPA offers over 160 symbols for transcribing speech, only a {{relatively}} small subset of these {{will be used to}} transcribe any <b>one</b> <b>language.</b> It is possible to transcribe speech with various levels of precision. A precise phonetic transcription, in which sounds are described in a great deal of detail, is known as a narrow transcription. A coarser transcription which ignores some of this detail is called a broad transcription. Both are relative terms, and both are generally enclosed in square brackets. Broad phonetic transcriptions may restrict themselves to easily heard details, or only to details that are relevant to the discussion at hand, and may differ little if at all from phonemic transcriptions, but they make no theoretical claim that all the distinctions transcribed are necessarily meaningful in the language.|$|E
5|$|One {{important}} source of language change is contact and resulting diffusion of linguistic traits between languages. Language contact occurs when speakers {{of two or more}} languages or varieties interact on a regular basis. Multilingualism is likely to have been the norm throughout human history and most people in the modern world are multilingual. Before the rise of the concept of the ethno-national state, monolingualism was characteristic mainly of populations inhabiting small islands. But with the ideology that made one people, one state, and <b>one</b> <b>language</b> the most desirable political arrangement, monolingualism started to spread throughout the world. Nonetheless, there are only 250 countries in the world corresponding to some 6000 languages, which means that most countries are multilingual and most languages therefore exist in close contact with other languages.|$|E
5|$|In August 1810, Tecumseh led 400 armed warriors {{down the}} Wabash River {{to meet with}} Harrison in Vincennes. As the warriors were dressed in war paint, their sudden {{appearance}} at first frightened the soldiers at Vincennes. The leaders of the group were escorted to Grouseland, where they met Harrison. Tecumseh insisted that the Fort Wayne Treaty was illegitimate. He argued that no one tribe could sell land without {{the approval of the}} other tribes; he asked Harrison to nullify it and warned that Americans should not attempt to settle the lands sold in the treaty. Tecumseh informed Harrison that he had threatened to kill the chiefs who signed the treaty if they carried out its terms, and that his confederation of tribes was growing rapidly. Harrison said the Miami were the owners of the land and could sell it if they so chose. He rejected Tecumseh's claim that all the Indians formed one nation. He said each tribe could have separate relations with the United States if they chose to. Harrison argued that the Great Spirit would have made all the tribes speak <b>one</b> <b>language</b> if they were to be one nation.|$|E
