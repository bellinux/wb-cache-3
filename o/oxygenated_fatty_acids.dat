40|$|Proteomic {{studies with}} Arabidopsis thaliana have {{revealed}} that the plant-specific tau (U) class glutathione transferases (GSTs) are selectively retained by S-hexylglutathione affinity supports. Over-expression {{of members of the}} Arabidopsis GST superfamily in E. coli showed that 25 of the complement of 28 GSTUs caused the aberrant accumulation of acylated glutathione thioesters in vivo, a perturbation that was not observed with other GST classes. Each GSTU caused a specific group of fatty acyl derivatives to accumulate, which varied in chain length (C 6 to C 18), additional oxygen content (0 or 1) and desaturation (0 or 1). Thioesters bound tightly to recombinant GSTs (Kd ~ 1 micromolar), explaining their accumulation. Transient expression of GSTUs in Nicotiana benthamiana followed by recovery by Strep-tag affinity chromatography allowed the respective plant ligands to be extracted and characterized. Again, each GST showed a distinct profile of recovered metabolites, notably glutathionylated oxophytodienoic acid (OPDA) and related <b>oxygenated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> Similarly, the expression of the major tau protein GSTU 19 in the endogenous host Arabidopsis led to the selective binding of the OPDA-glutathione conjugate, with the enzyme able to catalyze the conjugation reaction. Additional ligands identified in planta included other fatty acid derivatives including divinyl ethers and glutathionylated chlorogenic acid. The strong and specific retention of various <b>oxygenated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> by each GSTU and the conservation in binding observed in the different hosts suggests that these proteins have selective roles in binding and conjugating these unstable metabolites in vivo...|$|E

Fatty acids, abundant in nature, are regarded as important bioactive compounds and powerful nutrients playing {{an important role in}} lipid homeostasis and inflammation. Phytochemical study on Typhonium blumei Nicolson and Sivadasan (Araceae), a folk anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory medicine, yielded four <b>oxygenated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> 12 R-hydroxyoctadec- 9 Z, 13 E-dienoic acid methyl ester (1) and 10 R-hydroxyoctadec- 8 E, 12 Z-dienoic acid methyl ester (2), 9 R-hydroxy- 10 E-octadecenoic acid methyl ester (3), and 12 R *-hydroxy- 10 E-octadecenoic acid methyl ester (4). Isolated compounds were identified by spectroscopic methods along with GC-MS analysis. Isolated fatty acids together with a series of saturated, unsaturated and <b>oxygenated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were evaluated for their anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic activities in vitro. Unsaturated (including docosahexaenoic and eicosapentaenoic acids) as well as hydroxylated unsaturated fatty acids exerted strong anti-inflammatory activity in superoxide anion generation (IC 50 2. 14 - 3. 73 mu M) and elastase release (IC 50 1. 26 - 4. 57 mu M) assays. On the other hand, in the anti-allergic assays, the unsaturated fatty acids were inactive, while hydroxylated fatty acids showed promising inhibitory activity in A 23187 -and antigen-induced degranulation assays (e. g., 9 S-hydroxy- 10 E, 12 Z-octadecadienoic acid, IC 50 92. 4 and 49. 7 mu M, respectively). According to our results, the presence of a hydroxy group in the long chain did not influence the potent anti-inflammatory activity of free unsaturated acids. Nevertheless, hydroxylation of fatty acids (or their methyl esters) seems to be a key factor for the anti-allergic activity observed in the current study. Moreover, ChemGPS-NP was explored to predict the structure-activity relationship of fatty acids. The anti-allergic fatty acids formed different cluster distant from clinically used drugs. The bioactivity of T. blumei, which is historically utilized in folk medicine, might be related to the content of fatty acids and their metabolites...|$|E

The encoded proteins, 12 R-LOX and epidermal LOX- 3 (eLOX- 3), act in sequence to convert <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> substrates via R-hydroperoxides to specific epoxyalcohol derivatives and have been proposed to operate in the same metabolic pathway during epidermal barrier formation. Here, we show that eLOX- 3 deficiency in mice results in early postnatal death, associated with similar but somewhat less severe barrier defects and morphological changes than reported earlier for the 12 R-LOX-knockout mice. Skin lipid analysis demonstrated that the severity of barrier failure is related to the loss of covalently bound ceramides in both 12 R-LOX- and eLOX- 3 -null mice, confirming a proposed functional linkage of the LOX pathway to ceramide processing and formation of the corneocyte lipid envelope. Furthermore, analysis of free <b>oxygenated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> metabolites revealed strongly reduced levels of hepoxilin metabolites in eLOX- 3 -deficient epidermis, indicating an additional function of eLOX- 3 in mammalian skin as a hepoxilin synthase linked to the 12 S-LOX pathway...|$|R

Previous characterization of three Aspergillus fumigatus dioxygenases (PpoA, PpoB, and PpoC), similar in sequence to mammalian cyclooxygenases, showed that PpoA is responsible for the production of the oxylipins 8 R-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid and 5 S, 8 R-dihydroxy- 9 Z, 12 Z-octadecadienoic acid and that PpoC is responsible for 10 R-hydroxy- 8 E, 12 Z-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid. Here, �ppo mutants were characterized to elucidate the role of fungal dioxygenases in A. fumigatus development and host interactions. The �ppoC strain displayed distinct phenotypes compared to those of other �ppo mutants and the wild type, including altered conidium size, germination, and tolerance to oxidative stress as well as increased uptake and killing by primary alveolar macrophages.

We evaluated {{the formation and}} function of cytoplasmic lipid bodies. Lipid body formation in eosinophils was a rapidly (� 1 h) inducible response which was platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor–mediated, involved signaling through protein kinase C, and required new protein synthesis. In intact and enucleated eosinophils, the PAF-induced increases in lipid body numbers correlated with enhanced production of both lipoxygenase- and cyclooxygenase-derived eicosanoids. All principal eosinophil eicosanoidforming enzymes, 5 -lipoxygenase, leukotriene C 4 synthase, and cyclooxygenase, were immunolocalized to native as well as newly induced lipid bodies in intact and enucleated eosinophils. Thus, lipid bodies are structurally distinct, inducible, nonnuclear sites for enhanced synthesis of paracrine eicosanoid mediators of inflammation.

40|$|Abstract Traditionally, diatoms {{have been}} {{regarded}} as providing {{the bulk of the}} food that sustains the marine food chain and important fisheries. However, this view was challenged almost two decades ago on the basis of laboratory and field studies showing that when copepods, the principal predators of diatoms, feed on certain diatom diets, they produce abnormal eggs that either fail to develop to hatching or hatch into malformed (i. e. teratogenic) nauplii that die soon afterwards. Over the years, many explanations have been advanced to explain the causes for reproductive failure in copepods and other marine and freshwater invertebrates including diatom toxicity, or nutritional deficiency and poor assimilation of essential compounds in the animal gut. Here we review the literature concerning the first possibility, that diatoms produce cytotoxic compounds responsible for growth inhibition and teratogenic activity, potentially sabotaging future generations of grazers by inducing poor recruitment. The cytotoxic compounds responsible for these effects are short chain polyunsaturated aldehydes (PUAs) and other <b>oxygenated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> degradation products such as hydroxides, oxo-acids, and epoxyalcohols (collectively termed oxylipins) that are cleaved from <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> precursors by enzymes activated within seconds after crushing of cells.

Although these enzymes share common catalytic features, {{including the use of}} a tyrosine radical during catalysis, little is known about other residues involved in the dioxygenase reaction of PIOX. We generated a model of linoleic acid (LA) bound to PIOX based on computational sequence alignment and secondary structure predictions with COX- 1 and experimental observations that governed the placement of carbon- 2 of LA below the catalytic Tyr- 379. Examination of the model identified His- 311, Arg- 558, and Arg- 559 as potential molecular determinants of the dioxygenase reaction. Substitutions at His- 311 and Arg- 559 resulted in mutant constructs that retained virtually no oxygenase activity, whereas substitutions of Arg- 558 caused only moderate decreases in activity. Arg- 559 mutant constructs exhibited increases of greater than 140 -fold in Km, whereas no substantial change in Km was observed for His- 311 or Arg- 558 mutant constructs. Thermal shift assays used to measure ligand binding affinity show that the binding of LA is significantly reduced in a Y 379 F/R 559 A mutant construct compared with that observed for Y 379 F/R 558 A construct. Although Oryza sativa PIOX exhibited oxygenase activity against a variety of 14 - 20 -carbon <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> the enzyme did not oxygenate substrates containing modifications at the carboxylate, carbon- 1, or carbon- 2.

Analysis of the lipo-alkaloids in roots of Aconitum carmichaelii resulted in the isolation of six known pure lipo-alkaloids (A 1 –A 6) and a lipo-alkaloid mixture (A 7). The mixture shared the same aconitane skeleton of 14 -benzoylmesaconine, but their side chains were determined to be 9 -hydroxy-octadecadienoic acid, 13 -hydroxy-octadecadienoic acid and 10 -hydroxy-octadecadienoic acid, respectively, by MS/MS analysis after alkaline hydrolysis.

We found that during early stages of germination in cucumber, a lipoxygenase (linoleate: oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1. 13. 11. 12) form is induced that is capable of oxygenating the esterified fatty acids located in the lipid-storage organelles, the so-called lipid bodies. Large amounts of esterified (13 S) -hydroxy-(9 Z, 11 E) -octadecadienoic acid were detected in the lipid bodies, whereas only traces of other oxygenated fatty acid isomers were found. This specific product pattern confirms the in vivo action of this lipoxygenase form during germination. Lipid fractionation studies of lipid bodies indicated the presence of lipoxygenase products both in the storage triacylglycerols and, to a higher extent, in the phospholipids surrounding the lipid stores as a monolayer. The degree of oxygenation of the storage lipids increased drastically during the time course of germination. We show that <b>oxygenated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> are preferentially cleaved from the lipid bodies and are subsequently released into the cytoplasm.

Fatty acyl content, {{as a percentage of}} dry weight, ranged from 4. 9 % in P. sempervirens to 18. 8 % in P. coronopus. Oxygenated FAs were a frequent, but not ubiquitous component of Plantago seed lipids, reaching a level of almost 15 % in the seeds of P. nivalis. The oxygenated FAs were identified as isoricinoleic acid (9 -hydroxy-cis- 12 -octadecenoic acid, IR) and 9 -oxo-cis- 12 -octadecenoic acid (OX). When present, most species contained both IR and OX. FAs containing oxo groups have not been reported as components of the seed oil of other plant species that synthesize IR or ricinoleic acid (12 -hydroxy-cis- 9 -octadecenoic acid), suggesting unique aspects to the pathway of oxygenated FA biosynthesis in Plantago. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) demonstrated that IR and OX are components of triacylglycerol, and triacylglycerol estolides are a minor component of the seed oil of P. lanceolata with secondary acylation by oxygenated FAs.

Lipoxygenases and their products play {{important roles in}} the pathophysiology of plants and fungi. The only known lipoxygenase with catalytic manganese (Mn-lipoxygenase) is secreted by a devastating root pathogen of wheat, the Take-all fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis. Its mycelia also contains linoleate diol synthase (LDS), which can oxidize linoleic acid to sporulation hormones. Mn-lipoxygenase belongs to the lipoxygenase gene family. Recombinant Mn-lipoxygenase was successfully expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris with an expression level of 30 mg/L in fermentor culture. The tentative metal ligands of Mn-lipoxygenase were studied by site-directed mutagenesis. The results show that four residues His- 274, His- 278, His- 462 and the C-terminal Val- 602 likely coordinate manganese, as predicted by sequence alignments with Fe lipoxygenases. Mn-lipoxygenase (~ 100 kDa) contains an Asp-Pro peptide bond in the N-terminal region, which appears to hydrolyze during storage and in the acidic media during Pichia expression to an active enzyme of smaller size, mini-Mn-lipoxygenase (~ 70 kDa). The active form of Mn-lipoxygenase can <b>oxygenate</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> of variable chain length, suggesting that the <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> enter the catalytic site with the ω-end (“tail first”). Mn-lipoxygenase is an R-lipoxygenase with a conserved Gly 316 residue known as a determinant of stereospecificity in other R/S lipoxygenases.

Initial oxygenation of substrate fatty acids is mainly catalyzed by lipoxygenases and alpha-dioxygenases {{but can also}} take place non-enzymatically by autoxidation or singlet oxygen-dependent reactions. The resulting hydroperoxides are further metabolized by secondary enzymes to produce a large variety of compounds, including the hormone jasmonic acid and short-chain green leaf volatiles. In flowering plants, which lack arachidonic acid, oxylipins are produced mainly from oxidation of polyunsaturated C 18 fatty acids, notably linolenic and linoleic acids. Algae and mosses in addition possess polyunsaturated C 20 fatty acids including arachidonic and eicosapentaenoic acids, which can also be oxidized by lipoxygenases and transformed into bioactive compounds. Mosses are phylogenetically placed between unicellular green algae and flowering plants, allowing evolutionary studies of the different oxylipin pathways. During the last years the moss Physcomitrella patens has become an attractive model plant for understanding oxylipin biosynthesis and diversity.

40|$|Dioxygenase-cytochrome P 450 (DOX-CYP) fusion enzymes {{are present}} in diverse human and plant {{pathogenic}} fungi. They <b>oxygenate</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> to lipid mediators which have regula­tory functions in fungal development and toxin production. These enzymes catalyze the for­mation of <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> hy­droperoxides which are subsequently converted by the P 450 activities or reduced to the corresponding alcohols. The N-terminal DOX domains show catalytic and structural homology to mammalian cyclooxygenases, which belong to the most thoroughly studied human enzymes. 7, 8 -Linoleate diol synthase (LDS) of the plant pathogenic fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis was the first characterized member of the DOX-CYP fusion enzyme family. It catalyzes the conversion of linoleic acid to 8 R-hydroperoxylinoleic acid (HPODE) and subse­quently to 7 S, 8 S-dihy­droxylinoleic acid by its DOX and P 450 domains, respectively. By now, several enzymes with homology to 7, 8 -LDS {{have been identified in}} im­portant fungi, e. g., psi fac­tor-producing oxygenase (ppo) A, ppoB, and ppoC, of Aspergillus nidulans and A. fumigatus. By cloning and recombinant expression, ppoA of A. fumigatus was identi­fied as 5, 8 -LDS. Partial expression of the 8 R-DOX domains of 5, 8 -LDS of A. fumigatus and 7, 8 -LDS of G. graminis yielded active protein which demonstrates that the DOX activities of LDS are independent of their P 450 domains. The latter domains were shown to contain a conserved motif with catalytically important amide residues. As judged by site-directed mutagene­sis studies, 5, 8 - and 7, 8 -LDS seem to facilitate heterolytic cleavage of the oxygen-oxygen bond of 8 R-HPODE by aid of a glutamine and an asparagine residue, respectively. Cloning and expression of putative DOX-CYP fusion proteins of A.  terreus and Fusarium oxysporum led to the discovery of novel enzyme activities, e. g., linoleate 9 S-DOX and two allene oxide synthases (AOS), specific for 9 R- and 9 S-HPODE, respectively. The fungal AOS {{are present in}} the P 450 domains of two DOX-CYP fusion enzymes and show higher se­quence homology to LDS than to plant AOS and constitute therefore a novel class of AOS. In summary, this thesis describes the discovery of novel <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> oxy­genases of human and plant pathogenic fungi and the characterization of their reaction mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Cytochrome P 450 (CYP) family 4 {{constitutes}} monoxygenases {{responsible for}} hydroxylation of fatty acids and other lipids. For example, CYP 4 F 3 metabolizes leukotrienes and CYP 4 F 8 prostaglandin H. Importantly, {{six of the}} twelve CYP 4 enzymes are orphans, i. e., with an unknown biological function. The catalytic activity of the enzyme CYP 4 F 8 is known in seminal vesicles, but not in skin or psoriatic lesions, where CYP 4 F 8 is highly expressed. The orphan CYP 4 F 22 is also expressed in skin, and mutations in its gene {{has been linked to}} the rare skin disease lamellar ichthyosis, together with, inter alia, mutations in the genes of 12 R-LOX and eLOX 3. These enzymes appear to constitute a pathway producing hydroperoxides and epoxyalcohols from arachidonic acid. CYP 4 F 22 is hypothesized to act in a consecutive step within this pathway. The aim of this thesis was to develop analytical methods to prepare and analyze hydroperoxides and epoxyalcohols derived from fatty acids by LC-MS/MS, and to investigate the catalytic performance of CYP 4 F 8 and CYP 4 F 22 for these substrates. The 12 R-hydroperoxide of arachidonic acid (12 R-HPETE) was prepared by autoxidation and separated from other hydroperoxides by chiral HPLC. MS/MS analysis showed that the hydroperoxides were unstable within the ion trap, but were stabilized by an increase in the isolation width. From the hydroperoxides, epoxyalcohols were generated by hematin treatment, and separated by normal phase HPLC. MS/MS spectra of several epoxyalcohols, derived both from arachidonic acid and linoleic acid, were characterized with aid of [2 H]isotopomers and MS 3 analysis. Apart from metabolic studies the thesis also include detailed information on MS/MS analysis of several <b>oxygenated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> with proposed fragmentation mechanisms. The open reading frame of CYP 4 F 22 was expressed in a recombinant yeast system, and LC-MS/MS analysis revealed that CYP 4 F 22 catalyzed ω 3 hydroxylation of arachidonic acid, but not any of the tested epoxyalcohols. In contrast, CYP 4 F 8 metabolizes an epoxyalcohol derived from 12 R-HPETE, 11 R, 12 R-epoxy- 10 -hydroxyeicosatrienoic acid, to the ω 3 hydroxy metabolite. Conclusively, it was demonstrated that LC-MS/MS could be used for the analysis and separation of hydroperoxides and epoxyalcohols for metabolic studies...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{research}} {{started with}} analysis of oat fatty acids by using three different transmethylation methods. Basic sodium methoxide was compared with traditional acidic methanol {{for the total}} fatty acid analysis, while diazomethane was used to analyze free fatty acids. Epoxy FAs were readily hydrolyzed to dihydroxy fatty acids under the acidic condition, which suggest an overestimation of hydroxyl fatty acids and underestimation of epoxy fatty acids in previous analyses. The sodium methoxide method proved more reliable to quantify the oat seed fatty acid composition. CDC Dancer oat seed analyzed here was comprised mostly of palmitic acid (PA), oleic acid (OA) and the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) linoleic acid (LA) in quantities of 23 %, 32 %, and 37 % of total seed FA, respectively. As well, the seed contained small quantities of another PUFA, α-linolenic (ALA) and several unusual <b>oxygenated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (UFAs), Δ 15 -hydroxy fatty acid (15 HFA) and epoxy fatty acids in quantities of 0. 85 %, 0. 68 %, and 2. 3 %, respectively. This thesis further aimed to identify and assemble all FAD 2 -like genes from an oat Expressed-Sequence Tag (EST) database using FAD 2 and FAD 2 -like proteins from other organisms as query sequences in order to clone all putative FAD 2 -like genes-of-interest (GOIs) from oat. From the contig assemblies of retrieved oat ESTs, four distinct, putative genes were identified. From the Δ 12 -desaturase (FAD 2) queries, a putative FAD 2 -like (AsFAD 2) gene was identified; the Δ 15 -desaturase (FAD 3) queries revealed two putative oat FAD 3 -like (AsFAD 3 - 1 and AsFAD 3 - 2) genes, while an ω- 3 desaturase (FAD 7) query identified a fourth putative full-length FAD 6 -like coding sequence of two possible lengths, AsFADX and AsFADX+. The GOIs were then subcloned into a yeast expression vector and functionally characterized. AsFAD 2 a and AsFAD 2 b both demonstrated Δ 12 desaturation on 18 : 1 - 9 c substrate. AsFAD 3 - 1 had no activity on any substrates present, while AsFAD 3 - 2 exhibited weak Δ 15 -desaturation activity specifically on 18 : 2 - 9 c, 12 c. Finally, AsFADX converted 18 : 1 - 9 c to 18 : 2 - 9 c, 12 c, while AsFADX+ had no activity. Then, a comparative analysis of transcript levels of these GOIs via quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed across oat germinating seed, root, leaf, and developing seed. AsFAD 2 transcript abundance was generally much higher than AsFAD 3 - 1 and AsFAD 3 - 2 in all tissues. AsFAD 3 - 1 mRNA level was highest in developing seed tissue, slightly lower in leaf tissue, and lowest in root. AsFAD 3 - 2 mRNA was highest in germinating seed, and lowest in leaf tissue. In summary, the data produced from this thesis {{could be used to}} enhance breeding efforts for establishing oat cultivars with healthier oil content...|$|E

As we report here, plants make use of a similar LOX pathway to degrade their chloroplasts during leaf senescence. The enzyme involved is a 13 -LOX with unique positional specificity and molecular terms. Because 15 -LOX and 13 -LOX pathway products likewise operate in biological defense, a mechanism of cross-kingdom conservation of pathway regulation and function was uncovered for multicellular eukaryotes...|$|R
40|$|Arachidonic acid is a {{polyunsaturated}} <b>fatty</b> <b>acid,</b> {{which has}} four double bonds and {{belongs to the}} omega- 6 family of <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> Even {{if it can be}} formed in humans from one essential <b>fatty</b> <b>acid,</b> the linoleic acid, most of the arachidonic acid in the body comes with the intake of food. In mammalian cells, arachidonic acid is found esterified in cellular membranes. Phospholipases release arachidonic acid upon cellular stimulation. There are several mammalian lipases but the cPLA 2 -á has been shown to preferentially release arachidonic acid. Depending on which cell and what stimuli, arachidonic acid can he further metabolized into for example prostaglandins, thromboxan A 2 or leukotrienes. The first publication investigates the arachidonic acid release induced by cPLA 2 -á in human platelets after stimulation with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The release of arachidonic acid by PCBs was shown to be cPLA 2 -á dependent since it was completely blocked by the cPLA 2 -á inhibitors AACOCF 3 or pyrrolidine- 1. Two anti-estrogens, nafoxidin and tamoxifen, but not 17 â-estradiol inhibited PCB-induced arachidonic acid release. Interestingly, platelets incubated with PCBs did not aggregate despite the fact that a robust release of arachidonic acid was observed. The second publication investigates the 15 -LO- 1, which catalyzes the metabolism of several polyunsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> of both the omega- 6 and omega- 3 families. A unique feature of 15 -LO- 1 is that it translocates to internal cellular membranes and <b>oxygenates</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> also when they are esterified into lipids. The 15 -LO- 1 is expressed in lung epithelial cells, eosinophils, reticulocytes and IL- 4 stimulated monocytes and dendritic cells. In the second publication, 15 -LO- 1 was found to translocate to the plasma membrane in IL- 4 stimulated human dendritic cells upon calcium stimulation. The 15 -LO- 1 was shown to bind the membrane even when calcium was chanted. In a lipid-overlay assay, 15 -LO- 1 bound to certain phospholipids and especially phosphatidylinositol s The vesicle assay model was set up to investigate if phosphalidylinositols also influenced the enzyme activity of 15 -LO- 1. In the presence of calcium, the addition of phosphatidylinositol- 4. 5 -bisphosphate (PI(4. 5) P 2) or PI(3. 4) P 2 to the vesicles increased the 15 -LO- 1 activity on the substrate arachidonic acid. Kinetic assays were performed and the Vmax was shown to be unchanged but the apparent Km of 15 -LO- 1 towards arachidonic acid was significantly lower in the presence of PI(4. 5) P 2 or PI(3. 4) P 2 in the vesicles, Taken together, this thesis demonstrates that 15 -LO- 1 and cPLA 2 -á share several regulatory properties even though they catalyze different reactions in the arachidonic acid metabolism...|$|R
40|$|The biocatalytic {{synthesis}} of <b>oxygenated</b> biofuels (<b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> solketal esters, FASEs) and biodiesel (<b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> methyl esters, FAMEs) {{was carried out}} by both the direct esterification of <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (i. e., lauric, myristic, palmitic, and oleic acids, respectively) with solketal or methanol, and the transesterification of vegetable oils (i. e. sunflower, olive, cottonseeds, and waste cooking oil) with the same alcohols, in hydrophobic ionic liquids (ILs) based on cations with long alkyl side-chains (e. g., octadecyltrimethylammonium bis- (trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide [C 18 tma][NTf 2]). These hydrophobic ILs are temperature switchable ionic liquid/solid phases that behave as sponge-like system. As liquid phases, they are excellent monophasic reaction media for proposed biotransformations with all the assayed fat substrates, e. g. near to 100 % yield of <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> solketyl esters (FASEs) and <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> methyl esters (FAMEs) in 6 h at 60 °C. By using waste cooking oil mixed with free <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> as substrate, green biofuels containing either both FAMEs and FASEs (e. g., aprox. 80 % FAMEs and 20 % FASEs, etc.) can easily be prepared. Moreover, the reaction mixture can be easily fractionated by iterative centrifugations at controlled temperature into three phases, i. e. solid IL, water, and FAMEs + FASEs mixture leading to a straightforward and clean approach allowing the full recovery of the biocatalyst/IL system for further reuse and the simple product isolation. Furthermore, the enzyme did not shown any loss in activity during reuse in these reaction systems after six operation cycles.

The molecular response to {{ionizing radiation}}, however, {{is still not}} completely understood. Here, we screened mouse serum for metabolic alterations following an acute exposure to γ radiation using a multiplatform mass-spectrometry-based strategy. A global, molecular profiling revealed that mouse serum undergoes a series of significant molecular alterations following radiation exposure. We identified and quantified bioactive metabolites belonging to key biochemical pathways and low-abundance, <b>oxygenated,</b> polyunsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (PUFAs) {{in the two groups}} of animals. Exposure to γ radiation induced {{a significant increase in the}} serum levels of ether phosphatidylcholines (PCs) while decreasing the levels of diacyl PCs carrying PUFAs. In exposed mice, levels of pro-inflammatory, oxygenated metabolites of arachidonic acid increased, whereas levels of anti-inflammatory metabolites of omega- 3 PUFAs decreased. Our results indicate a specific serum lipidomic biosignature that could be utilized as an indicator of radiation exposure and as novel target for therapeutic intervention. Monitoring such a molecular response to radiation exposure might have implications not only for radiation pathology but also for countermeasures and personalized medicine...|$|R

Recombinant PA-LOX <b>oxygenates</b> polyenoic <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> including eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid to the corresponding (n- 6) S-hydroperoxy derivatives. This reaction involves abstraction of the proS-hydrogen from the n- 8 bisallylic methylene. PA-LOX lacks major leukotriene synthase activity but converts 5 S-HETE and 5 S, 6 R/S-DiHETE to anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving lipoxins. It also exhibits phospholipid oxygenase activity {{as indicated by}} the formation of a specific pattern of oxygenation products from different phospholipid subspecies. Multiple mutagenesis studies revealed that PA-LOX does not follow classical concepts explaining the reaction specificity of mammalian LOXs. The crystal structure of PA-LOX was solved with resolutions of up to 1. 48  Å and its polypeptide chain is folded as single domain. The substrate-binding pocket consists of two <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> binding subcavities and lobby. Subcavity- 1 contains the catalytic non-heme iron. A phosphatidylethanolamine molecule occupies the substrate-binding pocket and its sn 1 <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> is located close to the catalytic non-heme iron. His 377, His 382, His 555, Asn 559 and the C-terminal Ile 685 function as direct iron ligands and a water molecule (hydroxyl) completes the octahedral ligand sphere.

40|$|Prostaglandin-H synthase {{is unique}} among enzymes {{of the plant}} and animal kingdom {{in its ability to}} biosynthesize and metabolize hydroperoxides. Its {{cyclooxygenase}} activity <b>oxygenates</b> polyunsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> to hydroperoxy endoperoxides, and its peroxidase activity reduces the hydroperoxy group to hydroxy groups. Higher oxidation states of the peroxidase oxidize reducing substrates to electron-deficient derivatives that react with macromolecular nucleophiles. In the case of aromatic amines, the electrondeficient derivatives are mutagenic to bacterial and mammalian cells. 3 -Dicarbonyl compounds and retinoic acid are oxidized to carbon-centered radicals that react with 02 to form peroxyl free radicals. Peroxyl radicals are the most stable oxy radicals and are able to diffuse some distance from the site of their generation. Peroxyl radicals are also formed during lipid peroxidation and in the reaction of polyunsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> hydroperoxides with metal complexes and metalloproteins. Peroxyl radicals epoxidize isolated doubled bonds of compounds such as 7, 8 -dihydroxy- 7, 8 -dihydrobenzo(a) pyrene (BP- 7, 8 -diol); 3, 4 dihydroxy- 3, 4 -dihydrobenzo(a) anthracene; and aflatoxin B 1.
