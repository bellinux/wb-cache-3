5|$|As {{presiding}} {{officer of}} the Senate, Johnson was called on to cast a tie-breaking vote fourteen times, more than all <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>predecessors</b> save John Adams and John Calhoun. Despite the precedent set by some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>predecessors,</b> Johnson never addressed the Senate {{on the occasion of}} a tie-breaking vote; he did once explain his vote via an article in the Kentucky Gazette.|$|E
5|$|Khrimian died on 29 October 1907. He was buried, {{like many}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>predecessors,</b> at the {{courtyard}} of Etchmiadzin Cathedral. Sculptor Sergey Merkurov made his death mask.|$|E
5|$|Bewick's art is {{considered}} the pinnacle of his medium, now called wood engraving. This is due both to his skill and to the method, which unlike the wood cut technique <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>predecessors,</b> carves against the grain, in hard box wood, using fine tools normally favoured by metal engravers.|$|E

5|$|George III {{lived for}} 81 years and 239 days and reigned for 59 years and 96 days: both {{his life and}} his reign were longer than those of any <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>predecessors.</b> Only Victoria and Elizabeth II have since lived and reigned longer.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{theories}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>predecessors,</b> Zhang Heng systematically developed the celestial sphere theory. An armillary constructed {{on the basis}} of his hypotheses bears a remarkable similarity to Ptolemy's earth-centered theory. However, Zhang Heng did not definitely propose a theoretical model like Ptolemy's earth-centered one. It is astonishing that the celestial model Zhang Heng constructed was almost a physical model of Ptolemy's earth-centered theory. Only a single step separates the celestial globe from the earth-centered theory, but Chinese astronomers never took that step.|$|E
5|$|Béla was crowned king {{at least}} {{two months after the}} death of Stephen II, {{implying}} that his accession to the throne did not happen without opposition. Two violent purges were carried out among the partisans <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>predecessors</b> to strengthen Béla's rule. King Coloman's alleged son Boris tried to dethrone Béla but the king and his allies defeated the pretender's troops in 1132. In the second half of Béla's reign, Hungary adopted an active foreign policy. Bosnia and Split seem to have accepted Béla's suzerainty around 1136.|$|E

5|$|Caligula's {{religious}} {{policy was}} {{a departure from}} that <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>predecessors.</b> According to Cassius Dio, living emperors could be worshipped as divine {{in the east and}} dead emperors could be worshipped as divine in Rome. Augustus had the public worship his spirit on occasion, but Dio describes this as an extreme act that emperors generally shied away from. Caligula took things a step further and had those in Rome, including senators, worship him as a tangible, living god.|$|E
5|$|Constantine {{made some}} new laws {{regarding}} the Jews, but {{while some of}} his edicts were unfavorable towards Jews, they were not harsher than those <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>predecessors.</b> It was made illegal for Jews to seek converts or to attack other Jews who had converted to Christianity. They were forbidden to own Christian slaves or to circumcise their slaves. On the other hand, Jewish clergy were given the same exemptions as Christian clergy.|$|E
5|$|Much of Shen Kuo's written {{work was}} {{probably}} purged {{under the leadership}} of minister Cai Jing (1046–1126), who revived the New Policies of Wang Anshi, although he set out on a campaign of attrition to destroy or radically alter the written work <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>predecessors</b> and especially Conservative enemies. For example, only six of Shen's books remain, and four of these have been significantly altered since the time they were penned by the author.|$|E

5|$|Alternatively, recent {{excavations}} {{have yielded}} seals of Neferhotep's brother Sobekhotep IV in proximity with seals {{of the powerful}} Hyksos king Khyan of the 15th Dynasty (c.16501550 BC) in a closed archaeological context, possibly indicating that the two were contemporary. If this is so, Neferhotep I would have been contemporary with either Khyan or one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>predecessors,</b> such as Sakir-Har, {{and would not have}} reigned over the Nile Delta. This conclusion is strongly debated at the moment since Sobekhotep IV and Khyan are separated by c. 100 years in the conventional Egyptian chronology.|$|E
5|$|As a final factor, Lee faced {{a new and}} {{formidable}} {{opponent in}} George G. Meade, and the Army of the Potomac fought well on its home territory. Although new to his army command, Meade deployed his forces relatively effectively; relied on strong subordinates such as Winfield S. Hancock to make decisions where {{and when they were}} needed; took great advantage of defensive positions; nimbly shifted defensive resources on interior lines to parry strong threats; and, unlike some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>predecessors,</b> stood his ground throughout the battle in the face of fierce Confederate attacks.|$|E
5|$|Born between 1280 and 1292 Michael Shishman {{was the son}} of the despot Shishman of Vidin by {{an unnamed}} {{daughter}} of the sebastokrator Peter and Anna (Theodora), herself daughter of Ivan Asen II (r. 1218-1241) and Irene Komnene of Epirus. He was also a distant cousin <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>predecessors</b> on the Bulgarian throne, Theodore Svetoslav (r. 1300-1321) and George Terter II (r. 1321-1322). After the peace between his father and Stefan Milutin in 1292, Michael Shishman was engaged to Milutin's daughter Anna Neda and they married in 1298 or 1299.|$|E

5|$|Castillo Armas faced {{significant}} internal resistance, {{which was}} blamed on communist agitation. The government, plagued by corruption and soaring debt, became dependent on {{aid from the}} US. In 1957 Castillo Armas was assassinated by a palace guard with leftist sympathies. He {{was the first of}} a series of authoritarian rulers in Guatemala who were close allies of the US. His reversal of the reforms <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>predecessors</b> sparked a series of leftist insurgencies in the country after his death, culminating in the Guatemalan Civil War of 1960 to 1996.|$|E
5|$|Cynesige, the {{archbishop}} of York, died on 22 December 1060, and Ealdred was elected Archbishop of York on Christmas Day, 1060. Although a bishop was promptly appointed to Hereford, none was named to Worcester, {{and it appears that}} Ealdred intended to retain Worcester along with York, which several <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>predecessors</b> had done. There were a few reasons for this, one of which was political, as the kings of England preferred to appoint bishops from the south to the northern bishoprics, hoping to counter the northern tendency towards separatism. Another reason was that York was not a wealthy see, and Worcester was. Holding Worcester along with York allowed {{the archbishop}} sufficient revenue to support himself.|$|E
5|$|For {{the second}} edition, {{published}} in 1539, Calvin dropped this format {{in favour of}} systematically presenting the main doctrines from the Bible. In the process, the book was enlarged from six chapters to seventeen. He concurrently worked on another book, the Commentary on Romans, {{which was published in}} March 1540. The book was a model for his later commentaries: it included his own Latin translation from the Greek rather than the Latin Vulgate, an exegesis, and an exposition. In the dedicatory letter, Calvin praised the work <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>predecessors</b> Philipp Melanchthon, Heinrich Bullinger, and Martin Bucer, but he also took care to distinguish his own work from theirs and to criticise some of their shortcomings.|$|E

5|$|His campaigns conquered much French territory, but by 1374, all {{the gains}} had been lost. Edward's reign was also {{marked by the}} further {{development}} of Parliament, which came to {{be divided into two}} Houses. In 1377, Edward III died, leaving the Crown to his 10-year-old grandson Richard II. Like many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>predecessors,</b> Richard II conflicted with the nobles by attempting to concentrate power in his own hands. In 1399, while he was campaigning in Ireland, his cousin Henry Bolingbroke seized power. Richard was deposed, imprisoned, and eventually murdered, probably by starvation, and Henry became king as Henry IV.|$|E
5|$|Prescott's main {{secondary}} {{source for}} the history was Leopold von Ranke's Fürste und Völker von Süd-Europa im sechzehnten und siebzehnten Jahrhundert, a comprehensive work which included a detailed history of the papacy. Prescott admired Ranke's empirical historical method, and considered his work {{to be the best}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>predecessors</b> on the subject. He had four copies of the relevant sections of the work reprinted in a large typeface so he could read it without assistance. He had made a broad plan of the work by February 1849. Prescott started writing the draft on July 26. At this time, Prescott was a creditor of John White Webster, the chemist and murderer, and he was subsequently involved in his trial.|$|E
5|$|Robert Foliot (died 1186) was {{a medieval}} Bishop of Hereford in England. He was a {{relative}} {{of a number of}} English ecclesiastics, including Gilbert Foliot, one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>predecessors</b> at Hereford. After serving Alexander, Bishop of Lincoln as a clerk, he became a clerk of Henry of Blois, the Bishop of Winchester and brother of King Stephen of England. He attended the Council of Reims in 1148, where another relative, Robert de Chesney, was elected as Bishop of Hereford. Chesney then secured the office of Archdeacon of Oxford for Foliot.|$|E
