5|$|Benjamin Woolfield Mountfort (13 March 1825 – 15 March 1898) was an English {{emigrant}} to New Zealand, {{where he}} became <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> country's most prominent 19th-century architects. He was instrumental in shaping the city of Christchurch's unique architectural identity and culture, and was appointed the first official Provincial Architect of the developing province of Canterbury. Heavily influenced by the Anglo-Catholic philosophy behind early Victorian architecture, he is credited with importing the Gothic revival style to New Zealand. His Gothic designs constructed in both wood and stone in the province are considered unique to New Zealand. Today, he is considered the founding architect of the province of Canterbury.|$|E

5|$|The {{excavations}} of the tel {{has revealed}} a small settlement, the only <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> period in eastern Arabia, on its northern side.

The small houses they built were made of rough stone with clay or mortar as binding material. The plastered floors in the houses {{were said to have}} been spacious.

5|$|Unlike most of {{the larger}} Orkney islands, the {{derivation}} of the name 'Shapinsay' is not obvious. The final 'ay' is from the Old Norse for island, but the first two syllables {{are more difficult to}} interpret. Haswell-Smith (2004) suggests the root may be hjalpandis-øy (helpful island) owing to the presence of a good harbour, although anchorages are plentiful in the archipelago. The first written record dates from 1375 in a reference to Scalpandisay, which may suggest a derivation from Judge's island. Another suggestion is Hyalpandi's island, although no <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> name is known to be associated with Shapinsay.|$|E
