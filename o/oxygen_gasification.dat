However, the technical options for the reduction of CO 2 emissions will define the extent of their share in the future energy mix. The production of synthetic or substitute natural gas (SNG) from solid fossil fuels seems to be a very attractive process: coal and lignite can be upgraded into a methane rich gas which can be transported and further used in high efficient power systems coupled with CO 2 sequestration technologies. The aim of this paper is to present a modeling analysis comparison between substitute natural gas production from coal by means of allothermal steam gasification and autothermal <b>oxygen</b> <b>gasification.</b> In order to produce SNG from syngas several unit operations are required such as syngas cooling, cleaning, potential compression and, of course, methanation reactors.

The NOX emissions from syngas combustion were characterized from different burner operating conditions such as varying heat rates and equivalence ratio. It was shown that oxygen-enriched air and steam gasification favors the increase of combustible gas components such as H 2, CO, CH 4 and lighter hydrocarbons and improves the lower heating value of syngas up to 28 % and 43 % for seed corn and wood, respectively.

Although the two-stage gasification approach in which oxygen and steam were separately fed to the reactor was studied in both of these experimental UCG units, hydrogen-rich syngas should be obtained (Liu et al. 2011; Krzysztof et al. 2012), but the practical operation of the UCG process is difficult as regards the measurement of the temperature in the reaction zone and the control of the switching between oxygen and steam stages according to the change in temperature.

The peculiarities of devolatilization, <b>oxygen</b> <b>gasification</b> (temperature-programmed combustion), {{and the formation of}} nitrogen oxides are discussed. Small sample sizes (0. 2 – 4 mg) were employed to minimize the effects of heat and mass transfer limitations; nevertheless the results offered a reliable characterization of kilograms of charcoal. Samples produced in different runs or taken from different parts of the reactor behaved similarly with only minor differences that we attribute to reactor inhomogeneities and variations in feedstock composition. In the presence of oxygen, two partial processes were detected. The lower temperature weight loss may be due to devolatilization of the char and oxidation of the volatile matter, that results in a carbonized residue. The residue burns off around 450 – 500 C. The rate of both processes evidenced strong dependence on oxygen concentration, indicating an unexpected influence of oxidation on the low temperature devolatilization processes. The intensity of the mass-spectrometric ion signal for NO+, which represents the formation of nitrogen oxides, did not follow the overall mass loss rate curves (DTG). The peak temperatures of the NO+ and DTG curves differed by 3 – 9 ºC. These differences were influenced by the feedstock composition, but did not depend on such operating conditions as the heating rate and oxygen concentration.

This multi-step process produces hydrocarbon fuels from biomass, the so-called “second generation biofuels” that, unlike first generation biofuels, have the ability to make use of a wider range of biomass feedstock than just plant oils and sugar/starch components. A BTL process based on gasification has yet to be commercialized. This work focuses on the techno-economic feasibility of nine BTL plants. The scope was limited to hydrocarbon products as these can be readily incorporated and integrated into conventional markets and supply chains. The evaluated BTL systems were based on pressurised <b>oxygen</b> <b>gasification</b> of wood biomass or bio-oil and they were characterised by different fuel synthesis processes including: Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, the Methanol to Gasoline (MTG) process and the Topsoe Integrated Gasoline (TIGAS) synthesis. This was the first time that these three fuel synthesis technologies were compared in a single, consistent evaluation. The selected process concepts were modelled using the process simulation software IPSEpro to determine mass balances, energy balances and product distributions. For each BTL concept, a cost model was developed in MS Excel to estimate capital, operating and production costs. An uncertainty analysis based on the Monte Carlo statistical method, was also carried out to examine how the uncertainty in the input parameters of the cost model could affect the output (i. e. production cost) of the model. This was the first time that an uncertainty analysis was included in a published techno-economic assessment study of BTL systems. It was found that bio-oil gasification cannot currently compete with solid biomass gasification due to the lower efficiencies and higher costs associated with the additional thermal conversion step of fast pyrolysis. Fischer-Tropsch synthesis was the most promising fuel synthesis technology for commercial production of liquid hydrocarbon fuels since it achieved higher efficiencies and lower costs than TIGAS and MTG. None of the BTL systems were competitive with conventional fossil fuel plants. However, if government tax take was reduced by approximately 33 % or a subsidy of £ 55 /t dry biomass was available, transport biofuels could be competitive with conventional fuels.

40|$|Ambitions in {{exploration}} {{of oil and}} gas fields at deeper water depth require continuous investigation and maintenance. The transportation pipelines laid in deep waters are both subjected to corrosion and buckling due to environmental phenomena. They may also often undergo branching (namely hot tapping) to redirect (or add to) the transportation paths. Mechanical joints and welding are both considered as available alternatives when sectioning and replacement of the pipes at shallow waters is necessary, yet, welding is more promising for deep waters where remote operation is central. Fusion welding on the other hand comprises several technological detractions for sound operations under high ambient pressures disregarding its low cost and flexibility. The foremost detracting phenomenon in the arc welding is called ‘arc root constriction’, which is defined as arc geometry shrinkage under the increased pressure. Consequently, the power delivery to the weld pool at different pressure levels is a major worry. Effects of ionization and dissociation energies of different gases and mixtures, partial pressure of environmental gases including hydrogen and <b>oxygen,</b> <b>gasification</b> and degasification of the weld metal, inclusions that affect the phase transformation, absorption and desorption kinetics, oxidation and deoxidation reactions and many more are the phenomena that can possibly be altered by the gas type and ambient pressure level. Spattering and fume generation is a problematic issue since the arc is rather unstable under high pressure. Thus, seeking the effect of different chamber gas mixtures on welding parameters, final microstructure and mechanical properties is the main objective of this work. Statistical analysis of the collected voltage and current waveforms is carried out to identify the source of arc misbehavior and instability (discussed in Paper I). The stochastic parameters is related to the electrical stability and resolved into a number of varying welding parameters. The datasets are representing the effects of using pure argon under 14 incrementally increased pressure levels. Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) is used to characterize the frequency domain of the waveforms. Auto-correlation Function (AF) and Power Spectral Density (PSD) were calculated assuming the Wiener-Khinchin theorem. Considering the AF, it is possible to visualize the deteriorating stability of the arc. The rate of stability degradation is quite gentle after 20 bar, though, huge differences were observed from 1 to 20 bar. The characteristic frequencies of 100 - 150 Hz and 350 - 400 Hz were observed. The first range can be associated with the mass transfer or molten droplet launch frequency and the latter range is representative of the rectified mains. The spread of large low-frequency peaks at higher pressures is illustrating the mass transfer deterioration. The aforementioned peaks were found above 125 bar where the range of the characteristic frequency peaks in voltage and current waveforms started to deviate. The calculated arc power is higher at high-pressure range while the weld bead geometry was barely varied. It implies that the arc efficiency factor decreases at high pressures. The heat source dimensions and heat efficiency factor are two major inputs for finite element (FE) simulations of the weld. However, a systematic classification of these factors was hardly available prior to this work. Additionally, to the best of author’s knowledge, the direct high-speed observation of the arc inside the hyperbaric welding chamber has not been investigated in detail by far due to several technological issues. The varying bead-on-plate welds including the end crater appearance can possibly be good candidates to categorize the FE heat source dimensions. Double-ellipsoidal heat source (Goldak’s Model) was implemented in WeldSimS® FE code that is used in this study. Since the model incorporates two superimposed reference heat sources, the amount of dissipated heat from each source should be differentiated. An intermediate heat source model was employed for this purpose. The latter model is after Myhr and Grong that is called distributed point heat sources. This model can be accurately fit to the weld cross section geometry if calibrated accurately. The calibrated parameters were found to be very close to the ones required by Double-ellipsoidal heat source model. By using this approach, not only the effect of welding parameters on weld bead geometry can be categorized, but also the spent time for double-ellipsoidal heat source adjustments will be cut by 90 %. A Gaussian heat source was also employed for welding thermal cycle simulations. Accompanying experiments suggested that the thermal gradients hardly change as pressure elevates. However, {{it was found that the}} increased pressure level might not necessarily result in higher or lower cooling rates despite the geometrical changes. In a parallel investigation, the metallurgical effect of different shielding environments on phase transformation and mechanical properties of the bead-onplate weld samples was studies. Electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) and orientation imaging microscopy (OIM) techniques were used to identify the effect of five different shielding environments on the phase transformation. Argon and Helium chamber gases offer the conditions that facilitate the highest amount of acicular ferrite transformation, yet, they show some differences in a number of crystallographic details. CO 2 gas provided conditions for a lot of porosity in addition to the dominant polygonal ferrite/bainite transformation. He+½CO 2 mixture resulted in bainite transformation that was found to follow the maximum heat flow direction in terms of crystallographic orientations. Very small sized tensile and single-edged notch bending (SENB) samples were machined from the weld metal material. The tests revealed that the best mechanical properties are associated with the He chamber gas and the poorest properties were presented by the samples welded in He+½CO 2 shielding environment. It was also observed that there is a good correlation between the acquired acoustic signals and the fracture properties of the weld sample...|$|E

Gasification process simulation of coal inside a generic two-stage entrained flow gasifier to produce syngas was undertaken. Numerical simula-tion of the <b>oxygen</b> blown coal <b>gasification</b> process inside a two-stage entrained coal gasifier is stu-died with the commercial CFD solver ANSYS FLUENT. The {{purpose of this study is}} to use CFD simu-lation to improve understanding of the gasification processes in the state of art two-stage en-trained flow coal gasifier. Three dimensions, Navier-Stokes equations and species transport equa-tions are solved with the eddy-breakup reaction model to predict gasification processes. The in-fluences of coal/water slurry concentration and O 2 /coal ratio on the gasification process are in-vestigated.

The aim {{of the work is}} to describe temperatures and gas concentrations in the bed and to obtain data with high accuracy and with a resolution in space and time that is high enough to be useful for validation of mathematical models. To close mass balances of the main species, (C, H, O, N), O 2, CO, CO 2, N 2, H 2, H 2 O and hydrocarbons were measured, and samples of char and tar were analysed. For gas extraction an oil-cooled probe was used. The experimental rig was developed to achieve well-defined, one-dimensional, conditions. The measurements show the different episodes in the conversion front: initial heating by radiation, drying, release of volatiles, ignition and heat release, production of combustion products, depletion of <b>oxygen</b> followed by <b>gasification</b> reactions. During the stable devolatilisation phase a system of equations, based on concentrations measured by continuous gas analysis and mass balances, yields the content of tars, nitrogen and hydrogen (concentrations commonly not measured on-line) ...|$|R
40|$|Biomass based {{biofuels}} offer {{a significant}} potential to reduce {{greenhouse gas emissions}} in aviation and heavy load transportation. Though, the available biomass potential is subject to natural restrictions and further limited due to usage competition with other biomass applications. In order to maximize biofuel yield, Power and Biomass-to-liquid (PBtL) concepts gained recently in importance. The main idea is to add sustainable hydrogen from water electrolysis using renewable electricity in a reverse water-gas shift (rWGS) reactor to common biomass gasification concepts. A great challenge is to identify the optimal system design of PBtL plants in terms of fuel yield, energy efficiency and fuel net production costs. A large number of more or less state-of-the-art biomass gasification technologies exist currently on the market each one requiring a different biomass pretreatment and raw gas cleaning. Furthermore, {{the design of the}} synthesis plant offers various optimization options regarding operation conditions, selection of Fischer-Tropsch reactor type and number and position of recycle streams. Various PBtL system designs have been proposed at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) based on the different gasification technologies fix bed, fluidized bed and entrained flow gasification. The system performances were estimated and compared in terms of carbon conversion, energy efficiency and fuel net production costs. In addition, a detailed exergy analysis of a reference PBtL concept has been carried out in order to identify further optimizations potentials in the process chain. It was shown that the appropriate selection of the biomass gasifier highly depends on the type and available potential of biomass. Entrained flow gasification is superior in terms of economic performance for large scale PBtL plants in the > 100 MW (LHV biomass) range. Fluidized bed gasification is attractive for small and medium scale plants, though, an extensive syngas cleaning is typically required. Using pure <b>oxygen</b> as <b>gasification</b> medium reduces total investment costs significantly. By implementing several recycles and a high operation temperature in the rWGS reactor, carbon conversion efficiencies close to 98...|$|R
40|$|The German {{goverment}} {{decided to}} increase the percentage of renewable energy up to 20 % of all energy consumed in 2020. The development of biomass gasification technology is advanced compared {{to most of the}} other technologies for producing renewable energy. So the overall efficiency of biomass gasification processes (IGCC) already increased to values above 50 %. Therefore, the production of renewable energy attaches great importance to the thermochemical biomass conversion. The feedstock for biomass gasification covers biomasses such as wood, straw and further energy plants. The detrimental trace elements released during gasification of these biomasses, e. g. KCl, H 2 S and HCl, cause corrosion and harm downstream devices. Therefore, gas cleaning poses an especial challenge. In order to improve the overall efficiency this thesis aims at the development of gas cleaning concepts for the allothermic, water blown gasification at 800 °C and 1 bar (Güssing-Process) {{as well as for the}} autothermic, water and <b>oxygen</b> blown <b>gasification</b> at 950 °C and 18 bar (Värnamo-Process). Although several mechanisms for KCl- and H 2 S-sorption are already well known, the achievable reduction of the contamination concentration is still unknown. Therefore, calculations on the produced syngas and the chemical hot gas cleaning were done with a thermodynamic process model using SimuSage. The syngas production was included in the calculations because the knowledge of the biomass syngas composition is very limited. The results of these calculations prove the dependence of syngas composition on H 2 ~C-ratio and ROC (Relative Oxygen Content). Following the achievable sorption limits were detected via experiments. The KCl containing syngases were analysed by molecular beam mass spectrometry (MBMS). Furthermore, an optimised H 2 S-sorbent was developed because the examined sorbents exceeded the sorption limit of 1 ppmv. The calculated sorption limits were compared to the limits achievable in experiments. Finally, the hot gas cleaning concepts for both processes were developed on the basis of these results...|$|R
30|$|Following phase I, {{steam and}} pure oxygen were {{injected}} into the gasifier to increase (H 2  + CO) content in syngas to about 60  %. Experiments during phase II were carried out between about 28 and 117  h of the test. This phase was divided into two stages. One involved pure <b>oxygen</b> and steam <b>gasification</b> for 52.5  h, {{and the other was}} oxygen-enriched air and steam gasification for 36.5  h. The pure oxygen supply rate was in the range 4 – 9  m 3 /h. The rate of steam supplied should be adjusted according to the oxygen supply rate for keeping the (H 2  + CO) content in the syngas of about 60  %, in which H 2 accounted for 35  %– 45  % and CO for 20  %– 30  %. The supply rate of the stream was increased as the hydrogen content decreased, whereas the supply rate of the stream was reduced as CO content decreased to < 20  %. The main aim of the experiment in phase II was to establish the optimal volume ratio of steam to oxygen. The optimal range was found to be in the range 1.5 : 1 – 2 : 1 (Yang et al. 2008).|$|R

Due to fossil fuels scarcity and increasing concerns regarding sustainability and global warming, at least partial substitution by renewable energy seems inevitable. Gasification projects are being successfully developed in Northern Europe, and large-scale circulating fluidized bed biomass gasifiers have been commissioned in e. g. Finland. As Brazil has abundant biomass resources, biomass gasification is a promising {{technology in the}} near future. Biomasses can be converted into product gas through gasification. This work compares different technologies, e. g. air, <b>oxygen</b> and steam <b>gasification,</b> focusing {{on the use of}} the product gas in the indurating machine. The use of biosynthetic natural gas is also evaluated. Main parameters utilized to assess the suitability of product gas were adiabatic flame temperature and volumetric flow rate. It was found that low energy content product gas could be utilized in the traveling grate, but it would require burner’s to be changed. On the other hand, bio-SGN could be utilized without any adaptions. Economical assessment showed that all gasification plants are feasible for sizes greater than 60 MW. Bio-SNG production is still more expensive than natural gas in any case...|$|R

This article {{presents the results of}} a two week test campaign, in which crushed forest residues and industrial bark mixture were used as the feedstocks. The aim of the work was to carry out extended time testing of the developed gasification and hot gas cleaning process and to determine the fate of different gas contaminants and trace components of wood. In the test runs, wood fuels were gasified in the CFB reactor at a 0. 2 – 0. 25 MPa pressure using a mixture of steam and <b>oxygen</b> as the <b>gasification</b> agent. A mixture of sand and dolomite was used as the bed material in order to maintain stable fluidization and to catalyse in-situ tar decomposition before hot filtration. Raw gas was filtered at ca. 550 °C and the filtered gas was then led into a two-stage catalytic tar reformer. The gasifier performance and the concentrations of different gas contaminants were determined at four different operating variable set points during a total of 215 h of operation. The results for carbon conversion efficiency, raw gas composition and the fate of fuel nitrogen, chlorine and trace metals are presented in this paper. The concentrations of gas contaminants were determined after the ceramic filter unit and after the catalytic reformer. The conversion efficiencies for hydrocarbon gases, tars and ammonia in the reformer are also presented.

A commercial FCC catalyst and a bifunctional (BF) catalyst were used as the candidates for the RCCG process, and the BF catalyst was specially designed with both catalytic effects of oil cracking and coke gasification. The regeneration characteristics and kinetics of FCC and BF catalysts were studied using a micro fluidized bed. The results showed that high-quality syngas was produced when regenerating the catalysts via steam gasification and the sum of H- 2 and CO in the produced gas was over 80 vol % under electrically heated condition. The gasification rate first increased with increasing carbon conversion and then slowly decreased. In comparison with FCC catalyst, the regeneration time of BF catalyst was shortened by more than 30 % via addition of alkaline metal oxides and adjustment of its pore size. Homogenous model (HM) and shrinking core model (SCM) were used to calculate the regeneration kinetic parameters of coked catalysts. It was found that the activation energies from these two models were close to each other, while HM had a better fitting relevance for the data than SCM. The activation energy of BF catalyst regeneration was about 115 kJ. mol(- 1), lower than that of FCC catalyst (150 kJ. mol(- 1)), demonstrating that BF catalyst was easier to regenerate via coke gasification and also justified its bifunctional characteristics. The activation energy of coke gasification on BF catalyst could be further decreased to 45 kJ. mol(- 1) when introducing 3 % <b>oxygen</b> as the <b>gasification</b> reagent.

40|$|Indirect biomass {{gasification}} systems {{consist of}} two reactors: an oxidation reactor and a gasification reactor. A bed-material {{is used to}} transfer heat from the oxidation to the gasification reactor. Olivine has been widely studied as a reactive bed-material for this process. The iron in olivine {{can act as a}} catalyst for the decomposition of tars, produced during the gasification process. Moreover, iron is capable of transferring <b>oxygen</b> to the <b>gasification</b> reactor. In this study, we elucidate the role of iron in this chemical looping process. Mössbauer spectra show that during oxidation in O 2 /Ar at 750 °C, iron segregates out of the olivine matrix forming free iron oxide phases. These free iron phases form metallic iron upon subsequent reduction in hydrogen. Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) is used to quantify oxygen transport under alternating oxidizing/reducing conditions. TGA results indicate that at least 18 % of all the iron, present in olivine, is capable of transferring oxygen on the time scale of minutes. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) combined with depth profiling provides insight in the dynamic behavior of olivine under relevant conditions. Iron enrichment at the surface is observed; oxidized olivine has an iron rich surface layer of 400 nm. The increased iron concentration is particularly pronounced at the outermost surface. Upon subsequent reduction, the iron quickly redistributes in the olivine toward the original, homogeneous distribution. These results show that oxygen transport should be taken into account when olivine is evaluated as a catalyst for indirect biomass <b>gasification.</b> Furthermore, both <b>oxygen</b> transport and catalytic properties are heavily dependent on the iron phases present in the material, which in turn depend on the gas environment...|$|R
