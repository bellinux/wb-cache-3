5|$|The {{building}} is {{designed in the}} Italianate style, with the specialty leanings demanded by a schoolhouse. The front facade, which faces southwest today, is adorned with three doorways—left, right, and center— which span a front porch beneath the bell tower. When the school was open, the use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> was restricted. The left and right doors were used by boys in first through eighth grades while the middle door was earmarked as an entry for girls of all ages. Each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> feature transoms topped with cornices.|$|E
5|$|In chapter 34, {{the tree}} Glasir is stated as located in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> of Valhalla. The tree is {{described}} as having foliage of red gold and being the most beautiful tree among both gods and men. A quote from a work by the 9th century skald Bragi Boddason is presented that confirms the description.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} 15th century, {{there was a}} formal {{ceremony}} of degradation, in which Garter King of Arms, accompanied {{by the rest of}} the heralds, proceeded to St George's Chapel. While the Garter King of Arms read aloud the Instrument of Degradation, a herald climbed up a ladder and removed the former knight's banner, crest, helm, and sword, throwing them down into the quire. Then the rest of the heralds kicked them down the length of the chapel, out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors,</b> and into the castle ditch. The last such formal degradation was that of James, Duke of Ormonde in 1716.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{location}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> handle along <b>the</b> {{horizontal axis}} on <b>the</b> <b>door</b> may vary between {{a few inches}} or centimeters away from <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to <b>the</b> exact center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> depending on local culture, decorative style or owner preference. The distance from <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> handle is called the backset.|$|R

50|$|Three-point locking is a {{locking system}} {{installed}} in cabinet or locker doors to enable more secure locking. Whereas in single-point locking, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> on a cabinet locks {{only at the}} point where the key is turned, halfway up <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> three-point locking enables the top and bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to be simultaneously secured. This is accomplished by attaching two long steel rods to the lock on <b>the</b> inside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> which extend vertically upwards and downwards: when the lock is turned, <b>the</b> rotary movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> latch on <b>the</b> inside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> translates to vertical movement in these rods, with the result that the upper rod moves upwards by an inch or so, and the lower rod moves downwards similarly. This causes <b>the</b> ends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rods to move through small holes in the flanges at the top and bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> resulting from <b>the</b> metal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> being turned inwards, and the rods then move a short distance into holes in the metal surrounding <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> This effectively immobilizes the top and bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> and greatly increases <b>the</b> security <b>of</b> <b>the</b> door-locking compared to a door with only single-point locking.|$|R
5|$|Huston {{designed}} the large bronze {{doors at the}} capitol's main entrance. They were modeled by sculptor Otto Jahnsen and were both cast in one piece using the lost wax method of casting by the Henry Bonnard Bronze Company. The doors are decorated with scenes {{from the history of}} Pennsylvania, such as the arrival of William Penn and his peace treaty with the Lenape. Busts of people who were important {{in the construction of the}} capitol, like Governor Pennypacker, Boies Penrose, and Matthew Quay, decorate the edges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors.</b> The bust of Huston hides the doors' keyhole.|$|E
5|$|The house's room {{arrangement}} was planned for convenience and comfort, {{as compared to}} typical English mansions, which often were built with kitchens far from the dining room. Woodlea has 140 rooms, which were designed not to be drafty, and with important rooms not too remote. The rooms are all over-scaled {{in terms of the}} height of the ceilings and size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors,</b> with large fireplaces, and the length and breadth of the stairway to the house's second floor. The staircases have recesses with intricate decorative panels.|$|E
5|$|Arriving at the Necromanteion, the reunited crew is {{attacked}} by Clytius, Pasiphaë, {{and a group}} of their minions. Each of the demigods uses some aspect of their newly strengthened powers or identities to help defeat these monsters; for example, Hazel's new power and alliance with Hecate helps her defeat Pasiphaë and Clytius. During the questers' journey in the mortal world, Percy and Annabeth have been travelling through Tartarus to the other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doors</b> of Death, aided by the Titan Iapetus (Bob) and a few other beings. As the other demigods fight in the world above, Percy and Annabeth's group reaches the Doors and fights the personification of Tartarus to destroy the chains holding the Doors in place. Bob stays behind amongst hordes of angry monsters to defend the Doors while Percy and Annabeth escape. Once the full quest group is safely reassembled in the mortal world, Reyna arrives on her dying Pegasus. Annabeth says that Reyna, as a Roman, should bring the Athena Parthenos (in the Argo IIs hold) back to Camp Half-Blood to appease both the Greeks and Romans, with Nico and Coach Hedge volunteering to accompany her.|$|E

50|$|A doorjamb, {{door jamb}} (also {{sometimes}} doorpost) is <b>the</b> vertical portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> frame onto which a <b>door</b> is secured. <b>The</b> jamb bears <b>the</b> weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> through its hinges, and most types of door latches and deadbolts extend into a recess in the doorjamb when engaged, making <b>the</b> accuracy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plumb (i.e. true vertical) and strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> doorjambs vitally {{important to the}} overall operational durability and security <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
5|$|Mow Cop Castle is an elaborate, Gothic Revival folly, built {{two miles}} from Rode Hall, at Mow Cop, land {{previously}} belonging to the estate. Dating from 1754, the castle was built by Randle Wilbraham III and designed by the Hiorne brothers, the architects {{who worked on the}} 1752 improvements to the hall. It was constructed to improve the view across the valley from the hall. The family often used it as a summer house and for picnics. The castle fell into disrepair a number of times in the 19th century and several programmes of restoration were completed, including the replacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> at a cost of £4 4s. The castle and surrounding land were sold by the Wilbrahams in 1923. The castle is renowned as the birthplace of Primitive Methodism, following a camp meeting there in 1807.|$|E
5|$|With {{the failure}} of the Spanish match, Charles and Buckingham turned their {{attention}} to France. On 1 May 1625 Charles was married by proxy to the fifteen-year-old French princess Henrietta Maria in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> of the Notre Dame de Paris. Charles had seen Henrietta Maria in Paris while en route to Spain. The couple married in person on 13 June 1625 in Canterbury. Charles delayed the opening of his first Parliament until after the second ceremony, to forestall any opposition. Many members of the Commons were opposed to the king's marriage to a Roman Catholic, fearing that Charles would lift restrictions on Catholic recusants and undermine the official establishment of the reformed Church of England. Although he told Parliament that he would not relax religious restrictions, he promised to do exactly that in a secret marriage treaty with his brother-in-law Louis XIII of France. Moreover, the treaty loaned to the French seven English naval ships that would be used to suppress the Protestant Huguenots at La Rochelle in September 1625. Charles was crowned on 2 February 1626 at Westminster Abbey, but without his wife at his side because she refused to participate in a Protestant religious ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the game, {{the player}} must {{investigate}} the surroundings through finding and entering doors. These doors contain shops where players can buy equipment, rooms which provide additional information {{needed in the}} quest, traps which contain powerful enemies, and exits {{to the next level}} which can be opened after finding a key. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> in the game are hidden and can only be found through by trial and error. At the beginning of the game, shops are visible and are clearly marked with the appropriate signs. Later on in the game, as Wonder Boy gets closer to the MEKA Dragon, the shop doors become unmarked while others are traps set by the level's bosses; {{near the end of the}} game, many of the shops are invisible and contain more powerful weapons. There are four types of shops throughout the game: boot shops allow the player to buy boots which make Wonder Boy jump higher and run faster, armor shops contain armor which makes Wonder Boy incur less damage from enemy attacks, shield shops contain shields which allow him to repel fire from enemies, and magical shops allow players to purchase Magic Weapons. There are also various rooms in the game which the player can enter and receive additional assistance in the quest: taverns where players can buy drinks and receive information from the bartender, Fortune Teller rooms where players may receive information about future events, and hospitals which allow players to refill their life meter and Hourglass Timer for a small price. Other rooms contain a boss in which the player must defeat to get the key to the next level, to earn additional gold, or to upgrade to a more powerful sword.|$|E

50|$|A third {{strategy}} is to equip <b>the</b> <b>door</b> itself with a stopping mechanism. In this case, a short metal bar capped with rubber, or another high friction material, {{is attached to a}} hinge near <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> opposite <b>the</b> <b>door</b> hinge and on <b>the</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> which is in the direction that it closes. When <b>the</b> <b>door</b> is to be kept open, the bar is swung down so that the rubber end touches the floor. In this configuration, further movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> towards being closed increases the force on the rubber end, thereby increasing the frictional force which opposes the movement. When <b>the</b> <b>door</b> is to be closed, the stop is released by pushing <b>the</b> <b>door</b> slightly more open which releases the stop and allows it to be flipped upwards. A newer version <b>of</b> equipping <b>the</b> <b>door</b> with <b>the</b> stopping mechanism is to attach a magnet to <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> on <b>the</b> side which opens outward which then latches onto another magnet or magnetic material on the wall or a small hub on the floor. The magnet must be strong enough to hold <b>the</b> weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> but weak enough to be easily detached from the wall or hub.|$|R
