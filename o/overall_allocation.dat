While the number of commodities in the S&P Goldman Sachs CommodityIndex, Dow Jones-AIG and the Reuters-Jeffries/CRB index are broadly similar rangingfrom 19 to 24 commodities, the DBLCI has just six commodities. The allocation toenergy also differs substantially ranging from 70% in the S&P GSCI, 55% in theDBLCI, 39% in the RJ/CRB and 33% in the Dow Jones-AIG.|$|E

30|$|Note {{that the}} <b>overall</b> {{resource}} <b>allocation</b> {{problem is a}} non-convex combinatorial optimization problem. In addition, to solve the overall optimization problem, {{a significant amount of}} CSI feedback and information exchange between clusters is needed. Thus, computing its optimal solution within one step would require global network coordination, which is not realistic for implementation in real systems. Therefore, we propose a two-step resource allocation scheme to get closer to a practical implementation. In the following, we focus on a system with B = 3. The proposed scheme can be easily extended to the B > 3 case, e.g., multiple neighboring clusters can be grouped together to form a new bigger cluster.|$|R

The model contains an element of complexity that is not present in the previous DEA models for estimating returns to scale. It is found that apparent overall efficiency may hide scale inefficiency in individual activities. The model is applied to study the performance of individual specialties of National Health Services Trusts in the UK. It is argued that efficiency can be defined from two different perspectives: either as the most efficient internal allocation of resources, or the most efficient <b>overall</b> <b>allocation</b> of resources.
