500|$|The Pentecostal Holiness Church {{believes}} {{that no amount}} of good works can achieve justification or salvation. This is achieved only [...] "on the basis of <b>our</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> the shed blood, the resurrection, and the justifying righteousness" [...] of Christ. Good works, however, are a product of salvation. [...] "When we believe on Jesus Christ as our Savior, our sins are pardoned, we are justified, and we enter a state of righteousness, not our own, but His, both imputed and imparted".|$|E
500|$|Paul is a Christian and attends church every Sunday {{whenever}} possible. In one interview, Paul commented, [...] "I am so {{thankful that}} my parents raised me and C.J. to depend on God's guidance and <b>our</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> Him, and to always be thankful for what we receive." [...] He enjoys bowling and owns a franchise in the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA) League called L.A.X. He has hosted and participated in numerous celebrity and youth bowling events {{as the head of}} the CP3 Foundation, which benefits programs in Louisiana affected by Hurricane Katrina, as well as charities in Winston-Salem.|$|E

The color the white area is for peace. The three-colored rainbow represents the union of all the people of Pernambuco. The star indicates the state within the grouping of the Federation. The sun is the force and energy of Pernambuco, and finally, the cross represents <b>our</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> justice and mutual understanding." ...|$|E
5000|$|Faith as {{underlying}} rationality: In this view, {{all human}} knowledge and reason {{is seen as}} dependent on faith: <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> senses, <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> reason, <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> memories, and <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> the accounts of events we receive from others. Accordingly, faith is seen as essential to and inseparable from rationality. According to René Descartes, rationality is built first upon {{the realization of the}} absolute truth [...] "I think therefore I am", which requires no faith. All other rationalizations are built outward from this realization, and are subject to falsification at any time with the arrival of new evidence.|$|R

[...] "In the words of David, we ask God to cleanse our hearts, to keep us in the one true faith and to grant us the full joy of salvation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another related {{issue is}} the pistis Christou ("faith of Christ") debate. Paul several times uses this phrase at key points in his {{writings}} and it is linguistically ambiguous {{as to whether it}} refers to <b>our</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> Christ ("objective genitive"), or Christ's own faithfulness to God ("subjective genitive"), or even our faith/faithfulness to God like that which Christ had ("adjectival genitive"). There is wide disagreement within the academic community over which of these is the best rendering.For objective genitive: ...|$|E
2500|$|Friedrich Nietzsche famously {{suggested}} that an ancient, metaphysical {{belief in the}} divinity of Truth {{lies at the heart}} of and has served as the foundation for the entire subsequent Western intellectual tradition: [...] "But you will have gathered what I am getting at, namely, that it is still a metaphysical faith on which <b>our</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> science rests—that even we knowers of today, we godless anti-metaphysicians still take our fire too, from the flame lit by the thousand-year old faith, the Christian faith which was also Plato's faith, that God is Truth; that Truth is 'Divine'..." ...|$|E
5000|$|In May 2011, The Council of the Religious Institutions of the Holy Land {{endorsed}} a statement submitted by ICSD calling for {{religious and political}} leaders and faith communities to act to curb climate change. Some of the statement read, [...] "We call on adherents of <b>our</b> <b>faiths</b> <b>in</b> the Holy Land and worldwide to address this crisis by undertaking a deep reassessment of our spiritual and physical relationship to this God-given planet and how we consume, use and dispose of its blessed resources ... We hope that environmental challenges in our common home of the Holy Land and Planet Earth move religious adherents to overcome inter-religious strife and work together for ours and our children’s common well-being." ...|$|R
5000|$|In Scheeben's own words, the {{practical}} aim of his theology was [...] "to make the Christian feel happy about his faith. Because {{the beauty and}} eminence of <b>our</b> <b>faith</b> consist <b>in</b> this: that through the mysteries of grace it raises our nature to an immeasurably high plane and presents to us an inexpressibly intimate union with God." ...|$|R
50|$|We {{believe it}} is {{important}} to uphold the scriptural practices of the early church. Therefore, we hold to the practice of water baptism and the regular taking of Communion. We do not believe that either of these practices is essential for salvation, but that they serve as a demonstration of <b>our</b> living <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> Christ.|$|R
2500|$|Many Jews in the Palestinian Mandate {{contemplated}} retreating to Mount Carmel {{and organizing}} a defense line, due to prospects of a Nazi {{invasion of the}} region. Known alternatively as the [...] "Northern Program", [...] "The Carmel Plan", [...] "The Massada Plan" [...] and the [...] "Musa Dagh Plan", it was envisioned as a bastion against Nazi incursions, to hold out {{for at least three}} to four months.

2500|$|Due {{to their}} low social status and {{language}} barrier, Korean Americans received very {{little if any}} aid or protection from police authorities. David Joo, a manager of the gun store, said, [...] "I {{want to make it}} clear that we didn't open fire first. At that time, four police cars were there. Somebody started to shoot at us. The LAPD ran away in half a second. I never saw such a fast escape. I was pretty disappointed." [...] Carl Rhyu, a participant in the Korean immigrants' armed response to the rioting, said, [...] "If it was your own business and your own property, would you be willing to trust it to someone else? We are glad the National Guard is here. They're good backup. But when our shops were burning we called the police every five minutes; no response." [...] At a shopping center several miles north of Koreatown, Jay Rhee, who estimated that he and others fired five hundred shots into the ground and air, said, [...] "We have lost <b>our</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> the police. Where were you when we needed you?" [...] Koreatown was isolated from South Central Los Angeles, yet despite such exclusion it was the heaviest hit.|$|E
2500|$|For {{most of the}} 19th century, Rameau's music {{remained}} unplayed, {{known only}} by reputation. Hector Berlioz investigated Castor et Pollux and particularly admired the aria [...] "Tristes apprêts," [...] but [...] "whereas the modern listener readily perceives the common ground with Berlioz' music, he himself was more conscious of the gap which separated them." [...] French humiliation in the Franco-Prussian War brought about a change in Rameau's fortunes. As Rameau biographer J. Malignon wrote, [...] "...the German victory over France in 1870–71 was the grand occasion for digging up great heroes from the French past. Rameau, like so many others, was flung into the enemy's face to bolster our courage and <b>our</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> the national destiny of France." [...] In 1894, composer Vincent d'Indy founded the Schola Cantorum to promote French national music; the society put on several revivals of works by Rameau. Among the audience was Claude Debussy, who especially cherished Castor et Pollux, revived in 1903: [...] "Gluck's genius was deeply rooted in Rameau's works... a detailed comparison allows us to affirm that Gluck could replace Rameau on the French stage only by assimilating the latter's beautiful works and making them his own." [...] Camille Saint-Saëns (by editing and publishing the Pièces in 1895) and Paul Dukas were two other important French musicians who gave practical championship to Rameau's music in their day, but interest in Rameau petered out again, {{and it was not}} until the late 20th century that a serious effort was made to revive his works. Over half of Rameau's operas have now been recorded, in particular by conductors such as John Eliot Gardiner, William Christie, and Marc Minkowski.|$|E
60|$|It is a {{wonderful}} letter, which no Christian genius, much less one unsanctified, could ever have written. As showing the work of grace in a human heart, and in a very degraded and wicked one, it proves its own origin and reproves <b>our</b> weak <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> its power to cope with any form of wickedness.|$|R
