40|$|Lean {{is common}} sense and good {{business}} sense. As organizations grow and become more successful, they begin to lose insight into the basic truths of what made them successful. Organizations {{have to deal with}} more and more issues that may not {{have anything to do with}} directly providing products or services to their customers. Lean is a holistic management approach that brings the focus of the organization back to providing value to the customer. In August 2002, Mrs. Darleen Druyun, the Principal Deputy to the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition and government co-chairperson of the Lean Aerospace Initiative (LAI), decided it was time for Air Force acquisitions to embrace the concepts of lean. At her request, the LAI Executive Board developed a concept and methodology to employ lean into the Air Force’s acquisition culture and processes. This was the birth of the “Lean Now” initiative. An enterprise-wide approach was used, involving Air Force System Program Offices (SPOs), aerospace industry, and several Department of Defense agencies. The aim of Lean Now was to focus on the process interfaces between these “enterprise” stakeholders to eliminate barriers that impede progress. Any best practices developed would be institutionalized throughout the Air Force and the Department of Defense (DoD). The industry members of LAI agreed to help accelerate the government-industry transformation by donating lean Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to mentor, train, and facilitate the lean events of each enterprise. Currently, the industry SMEs and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are working together to help the Air Force develop its own lean infrastructure of training courses and Air Force lean SMEs. The first Lean Now programs were the F/A- 22, Global Hawk, and F- 16. Each program focused on specific acquisition processes. The F/A- 22 focused on the Test and Evaluation process; the Global Hawk focused on Evolutionary Acquisitions; and the F- 16 focused on improving the Contract Closeout process. Through lean, each enterprise made many significant improvements. The F/A- 22 was able to reduce its <b>Operational</b> <b>Flight</b> <b>Plan</b> (OFP) Preparation and Load process time of 2 to 3 months down to 7 hours. The Global Hawk developed a new production plan that increases the annual production of its Integrated Sensor Suite from 3 per year to 6 per year. The F- 16 enterprise generated and is working 12 initiatives that could result in a contract closeout cycle time reduction of 3 to 7 years. Each enterprise continues to generate more lean initiatives that focus on other areas and processes within their respective enterprises...|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} more timely and {{accurate}} weather data on airline <b>flight</b> <b>planning</b> {{with the emphasis}} on fuel savings is studied. This summary report discusses the results of each of the four major tasks of the study. Task 1 compared airline <b>flight</b> <b>plans</b> based on <b>operational</b> forecasts to plans based on the verifying analyses and found that average fuel savings of 1. 2 to 2. 5 percent are possible with improved forecasts. Task 2 consisted of similar comparisons but used a model developed for the FAA by SRI International that simulated the impact of ATc diversions on the <b>flight</b> <b>plans.</b> While parts of Task 2 confirm the Task I findings, inconsistency with other data and the known impact of ATC suggests that other Task 2 findings are the result of errors in the model. Task 3 compares segment weather data from <b>operational</b> <b>flight</b> <b>plans</b> with the weather actually observed by the aircraft and finds the average error could result in fuel burn penalties (or savings) of up to 3. 6 percent for the average 8747 flight. In Task 4 an in-depth analysis of the weather forecast for the 33 days included in the study finds that significant errors exist on 15 days.

40|$|Contingency {{analysis}} and reaction {{is a critical}} task {{to be carried out}} by any airplane to guarantee its safe operation in a non-segregated airspace. Pilot’s reactions to any kind of incidences that may occur in-flight, like engine malfunctions, loss of electrical power, hydraulic failure, unexpected weather, etc, will determine the fate of the flight. Nowadays, contingency reactions are mainly driven by the airplane manufacturer, with pre-analyzed contingency scenarios covered in the airplane documentation, and by ICAO’s rules as de-fined in the way <b>flight</b> <b>plans</b> should be prepared and landing alternatives implemented. Flight dispatching is the set of tasks related to flight preparation, such as load and balance, meteorology study and briefing, <b>operational</b> <b>flight</b> <b>planning,</b> contingency {{analysis and}} plan-ning, etc. However, managing contingencies on a UAS is a much more complex problem basically due to the automated nature of the vehicle and the lack of situational awareness that pilot’s in command should face.

40|$|Comprehensive {{assessment}} of the environmental aspects of flight movements is of increasing interest to the aviation sector as a potential input for developing sustainable aviation strategies that consider climate impact, air quality and noise issues simultaneously. However, comprehensive assessments of all three environmental aspects do not yet exist and are in particular not yet <b>operational</b> practice in <b>flight</b> <b>planning.</b> The {{purpose of this study}} is to present a methodology which allows to establish a multi-criteria environmental impact assessment directly in the <b>flight</b> <b>planning</b> process. The method expands a concept developed for climate optimisation of aircraft trajectories, by representing additionally air quality and noise impacts as additional criteria or dimensions, together with climate impact of aircraft trajectory. We present the mathematical framework for environmental assessment and optimisation of aircraft trajectories. In that context we present ideas on future implementation of such advanced meteorological services into air traffic management and trajectory planning by relying on environmental change functions (ECFs). These ECFs represent environmental impact due to changes in air quality, noise and climate impact. In a case study for Europe prototype ECFs are implemented and a performance {{assessment of}} aircraft trajectories is performed for a one-day traffic sample. For a single flight fuel-optimal versus climate-optimized trajectory solution is evaluated using prototypic ECFs and identifying mitigation potential. The ultimate goal of such a concept is to make available a comprehensive assessment framework for environmental performance of aircraft operations, by providing key performance indicators on climate impact, air quality and noise, as well as a tool for environmental optimisation of aircraft trajectories. This framework would allow studying and characterising changes in traffic flows due to environmental optimisation, as well as studying trade-offs between distinct strategic measure...|$|R
40|$|Collisions between {{aircraft}} and birds, so-called "bird strikes," {{can result in}} serious damage to {{aircraft and}} even in the loss of lives. Information about the distribution of birds in the air and on the ground can be used {{to reduce the risk of}} bird strikes and their impact on operations en route and in and around air fields. Although a wealth of bird distribution and density data is collected by numerous organizations, these data are not readily available nor interpretable by aviation. This paper presents two national efforts, one in the Netherlands and one in the United States, to develop bird avoidance nodels for aviation. These models integrate data and expert knowledge on bird distributions and migratory behavior to provide hazard maps in the form of GIS-enabled Web services. Both models are in <b>operational</b> use for <b>flight</b> <b>planning</b> and <b>flight</b> alteration and for airfield and airfield vicinity management. These models and their presentation on the Internet are examples of the type of service that would be very useful in other fields interested in species distribution and movement information, such as conservation, disease transmission and prevention, or assessment and mitigation of anthropogenic risks to nature.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Mechanical and Nuclear EngineeringDale E. SchinstockThe {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to develop methods and tools for generating <b>flight</b> <b>plans</b> for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). A method of generating <b>flight</b> <b>plans</b> is needed to describe data collection missions, such as taking aerial photographs. The <b>flight</b> <b>plans</b> are two-dimensional and exist in a plane a fixed distance above the Earth. Since the flight areas are typically small, the Earth's curvature is not accounted for in <b>flight</b> <b>plan</b> generation. Designed to completely cover a specified field area, the plans consist of a series of line and arc segments and are described in a format that is recognized by the Piccolo autopilot used by the Kansas State University Autonomous Vehicle Systems (AVS) Lab. Grids are designed to cover the field area, and turn maneuvers are designed to ensure efficient <b>flight</b> <b>plans.</b> The <b>flight</b> <b>plan</b> generation process is broken into several parts. Once a field area is defined, path lines covering this area are calculated. Optimal turn maneuvers are calculated to smoothly connect the path lines in a continuous <b>flight</b> <b>plan.</b> Two methods of determining path line order are discussed. One method flies the lines in the order that they are arranged spatially; the other method decides line order by calculating the shortest turn maneuver to another path line. After the <b>flight</b> <b>plan</b> is generated, a text file is created in a format that is readable for the autopilot. In order to easily generate <b>flight</b> <b>plans,</b> a graphical user interface (GUI) has been created. This GUI allows a user to easily generate a <b>flight</b> <b>plan</b> without modifying any code.
