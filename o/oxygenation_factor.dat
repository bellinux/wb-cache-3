40|$|ObjectiveOur {{objective}} {{was to assess the}} morbidity and mortality in children requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenator support after cardiac surgery and to determine factors influencing outcome. MethodsBetween January 2003 and June 2008, 58 patients required extracorporeal membrane oxygenator support after cardiac surgery. A retrospective study was performed and factors influencing outcome were determined by logistic regression modeling with the probability of outcome based on a combination of multivariate predictors. ResultsMedian age and weight were 12 days and 3. 3 kg, respectively. Thirty-one patients had single ventricle repair and 27 had biventricular repair. Median duration of support with the oxygenator was 6 days. Thirty-nine (67 %) patients were successfully weaned off the support, but only 24 (41 %) survived to hospital discharge. Chief complications were renal failure (31 %), neurologic complications (29 %), and sepsis (16 %). Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified 10 days or more of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (odds ratio =  6. 1), urine output less than 2 mL · kg− 1 · h− 1 in first 24 hours (odds ratio =  15), renal failure (odds ratio =  9. 4), and pH less than 7. 35 after 24 hours of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (odds ratio =  82) as significant independent factors associated with failure to wean off extracorporeal membrane <b>oxygenation.</b> <b>Factors</b> associated with failure of hospital discharge despite successful decannulation were as follows: extracorporeal membrane oxygenator support time of 10 days or more, red blood cell transfusion of greater than 1000 mL/kg during the entire period of oxygenator support, and sepsis. Patients with single ventricle repair were at higher risk of hospital mortality. ConclusionLonger duration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenator support, low pH and urine output in the first 24 hours, and renal failure are significant factors associated with mortality during extracorporeal membrane oxygenator support. Exposure to high amounts of blood transfusion during extracorporeal oxygenation, extended extracorporeal membrane oxygenator support, and sepsis increase risk of death after successful decannulation...|$|R
40|$|Background: Wound {{infection}} risk is {{inversely related}} to subcutaneous oxygenation, which is reduced in obese patients and may be reduced even more during laparoscopic procedures. Methods: We evaluated subcutaneous tissue oxygenation (PsqO 2) in 20 patients with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 40 kg·m– 2 (obese) and 15 patients with BMI < 30 kg·m- 2 (non-obese) undergoing laparoscopic surgery with standardised anaesthesia technique and fluid administration. Arterial oxygen tension was maintained near 150 mmHg. PsqO 2 was measured from a surrogate wound on the upper arm. Data were analyzed with unpaired two-tailed t or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests; P < 0. 05 was statistically significant. Data are given as mean (SD). Results: An FIO 2 of 51 % (13 %) was required in obese patients to reach an arterial oxygen tension of 150 mmHg; however, an FIO 2 of only 40 % (7 %) was required to reach the same oxygen tension in non-obese patients (P= 0. 007). PsqO 2 was significantly less in obese patients: 41 (10) vs. 57 (15) mmHg (P< 0. 001). Conclusion: Obesity reduces the amount of inspired oxygen required to obtain a given arterial partial pressure and tissue <b>oxygenation.</b> Both <b>factors</b> probably contribute to high infection risk in obes...|$|R
30|$|In cancer therapy, {{radiotherapy}} {{is preferred}} to surgical resection {{because it is}} non-invasive, allowing organ structures and functions to remain intact. Radiotherapy damages the DNA of cancerous cells by direct or indirect ionization of the atoms {{that make up the}} DNA chain. However, tumor responses to radiation vary with repair capacity, <b>oxygenation,</b> and other <b>factors,</b> and side effects in normal tissues increase with the higher doses used to kill radio-resistant tumor cells Peters et al. (1982). To increase the sensitivity of the tumor site alone, many potential radiosensitizers have been studied (Rotman et al. 1998). The mechanism of most radiosensitizers, except oxygen or nitric oxide, involves inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis, angiogenesis, DNA repair, and cell signaling, eventually inducing apoptosis in treated cells. To control and limit irradiation to tumor cells, sparing normal cells, it is important to develop methods to enhance dosing precision.|$|R
30|$|Numerous {{factors which}} {{influence}} wound healing can impair the whole process. In general, {{these factors are}} classified as local and systemic (Guo and Dipietro 2010). Local <b>factors,</b> <b>oxygenation</b> and infection, directly affect wound healing. Oxygen is critical for cell metabolism, energy production, and for all phases of wound healing. Superoxide, for oxidative killing of pathogens, produced by leukocytes is dependent on oxygen levels. In wounded region, vascular disruption causes depletion of oxygen leading to hypoxia. In wounds, where oxygenation is not restored, healing is impaired. Temporary hypoxia stimulates wound healing, while chronic hypoxia delays the process. Hypoxia induces macrophages, fibroblasts, and keratinocytes to produce cytokines and growth factors crucial for cell proliferation migration and chemotaxis, and angiogenesis in wound healing. Reactive oxygen species, during normal oxygenation, induce wound healing. However, in case of hypoxia, as their levels increase in cell, their beneficial effects are thwarted by their harmful effects of tissue damage (Bishop 2008).|$|R
40|$|The {{association}} of arterial oxygen content (CaO 2) and viscosity with transcranial Doppler (TCD) blood flow velocity {{in the middle}} cerebral artery was studied in 20 adults without cerebrovascular disease undergoing abdominal surgery associated with significant fluctuations in hematology. TCD measurements and arterial blood samples were obtained before and directly after surgery but before blood transfusion. There was an inverse association between baseline mean velocity and CaO 2 (r = - 0. 56), hematocrit (r = - 0. 50), hemoglobin (r = - 0. 51), and high-shear viscosity (r = - 0. 46). After intraoperative blood loss, intraindividual fluctuations of TCD measurements, blood <b>oxygenation,</b> and rheologic <b>factors</b> were studied. In multiple regression analysis, changes in CaO 2 had the strongest association with changes in TCD values, accounting for 55 % {{of the variation in}} mean velocity. Addition of hematocrit and viscosity could not account for more variation in mean velocity than CaO 2 alon...|$|R
40|$|Among {{ventilated}} children, {{the incidence}} of acute lung injury (ALI) was 9 %; of that latter group 80 % developed the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The population-based prevalence of pediatric ARDS was 5. 5 cases/ 100. 000 inhabitants. Underlying diseases in children were septic shock (34 %), respiratory syncytial virus infections (16 %), bacterial pneumonia (15 %), near-drowning 9 %, and others. Mortality ranged from 18 % to 27 % for ALI (including ALI-non ARDS and ARDS) and from 29 % to 50 % for ARDS. Mortality was only 3 %- 11 % in children with ALI-non ARDS. As risk <b>factors,</b> <b>oxygenation</b> indices and multi-organ failure have been identified. New insights into the pathophysiology (for example the interplay between intraalveolar coagulation/fibrinolysis and inflammation and the genetic polymorphism for the angiotensin-converting enzyme) offer new therapeutic options. Lung protective mechanical ventilation with optimal lung recruitment is the mainstay of supportive therapy. New therapeutic modalities refer to corticosteroid and surfactant treatment. Well-designed follow up studies are needed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserve...|$|R
40|$|Under {{conditions}} of reduced tissue <b>oxygenation,</b> hypoxia-inducible <b>factor</b> (HIF) controls many processes, including angiogenesis and cellular metabolism, and also influences cell proliferation and survival decisions. HIF is centrally involved in tumour growth in inherited diseases that {{give rise to}} renal cell carcinoma (RCC), such as Von Hippel–Lindau syndrome and tuberous sclerosis complex. In this study, we examined whether HIF is involved in tumour formation of RCC in Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome. For this, we analysed a Birt–Hogg–Dubé patient-derived renal tumour cell line (UOK 257) that is devoid of the Birt–Hogg–Dubé protein (BHD) and observed high levels of HIF activity. Knockdown of BHD expression also caused a threefold activation of HIF, which was not as a consequence of more HIF 1 α or HIF 2 α protein. Transcription of HIF target genes VEGF, BNIP 3 and CCND 1 was also increased. We found nuclear localization of HIF 1 α and increased expression of VEGF, BNIP 3 and GLUT 1 in a chromophobe carcinoma from a Birt–Hogg–Dubé patient. Our data also reveal that UOK 257 cells have high lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase and 3 -hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity. We observed increased expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (a HIF gene target), which in turn leads to increased phosphorylation and inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase. Together with increased protein levels of GLUT 1, our data reveal that UOK 257 cells favour glycolytic rather than lipid metabolism (a cancer phenomenon termed the ‘Warburg effect’). UOK 257 cells also possessed a higher expression level of the L-lactate influx monocarboxylate transporter 1 and consequently utilized L-lactate as a metabolic fuel. As a result of their higher dependency on glycolysis, we were able to selectively inhibit the growth of these UOK 257 cells by treatment with 2 -deoxyglucose. This work suggests that targeting glycolytic metabolism may be used therapeutically to treat Birt–Hogg–Dubé-associated renal lesions...|$|R
40|$|Acute kidney injury (AKI) is {{a common}} {{complication}} of hospitalization that {{is characterized by a}} sudden loss of renal excretory function and associated with the subsequent development of chronic kidney disease, poor prognosis, and increased mortality. Although the pathophysiology of renal functional impairment in the setting of AKI remains poorly understood, previous studies have identified changes in renal hemodynamics, perfusion, and <b>oxygenation</b> as key <b>factors</b> in the development and progression of AKI. The early assessment of these changes remains a challenge. Many established approaches are not applicable to humans because of their invasiveness. Functional renal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging offers an alternative assessment tool {{that could be used to}} evaluate renal morphology and function noninvasively and simultaneously. Thus, the purpose of this review is to illustrate the principle, application, and role of the techniques of functional renal MR imaging, including blood oxygen level-dependent imaging, arterial spin labeling, and diffusion-weighted MR imaging, in the management of AKI. The use of gadolinium in MR imaging may exacerbate renal impairment and cause nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. Therefore, dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging will not be discussed in this paper...|$|R
30|$|Changes in Cycladophora davisiana {{abundance}} {{cannot be}} explained by plausible changes in the NPIW influence, because the NPIW is characterized by low oxygen content in the ECS, and C. davisiana prefers an oxygen-rich environment (e.g., Kaneko et al. 2001). Thus, we attribute changes in bottom-water <b>oxygenation</b> to local <b>factors.</b> Indeed, from our data and other onboard data of Tada et al. (2015) discussed above, the time interval between MIS 1 and MIS 7 (0 – 220 ka) was probably characterized by higher primary productivity in shallow waters (Fig. 9). This finding implies that the deep-sea sediments collected from site U 1429 became richer in organic carbon after 220 ka (Fig.  9). Therefore, {{it is likely that}} the inferred increase in the primary productivity of shallow waters during MIS 6 and MIS 7 enhanced the production of organic matter (carbon), which sank to the sea bottom and increased the amount of organic carbon in deep-sea sediments. This organic carbon accumulated at the seafloor and was oxidized, which consumed the available oxygen at these depths (e.g., Ruddiman 2001). Therefore, an increase in the shallow-water productivity reduced the amount of available oxygen in the bottom water and thus decreased the bottom-water oxygenation, which probably caused the lowering of C. davisiana abundance.|$|R
40|$|Combined {{photosynthetic}} {{gas exchange}} and modulated fluorometres {{are widely used}} to evaluate physiological characteristics associated with phenotypic and genotypic variation, whether in response to genetic manipulation or resource limitation in natural vegetation or crops. After describing relatively simple experimental procedures, we present the theoretical background to the derivation of photosynthetic parameters, and provide a freely available Excel-based fitting tool (EFT) that will be of use to specialists and non-specialists alike. We use data acquired in concurrent variable fluorescence-gas exchange experiments, where A/Ci and light-response curves have been measured under ambient and low oxygen. From these data, the EFT derives light respiration, initial PSII (photosystem II) photochemical yield, initial quantum yield for CO 2 fixation, fraction of incident light harvested by PSII, initial quantum yield for electron transport, electron transport rate, rate of photorespiration, stomatal limitation, Rubisco (ribulose 1 · 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) rate of carboxylation and <b>oxygenation,</b> Rubisco specificity <b>factor,</b> mesophyll conductance to CO 2 diffusion, light and CO 2 compensation point, Rubisco apparent Michaelis-Menten constant, and Rubisco CO 2 -saturated carboxylation rate. As an example, a complete analysis of gas exchange data on tobacco plants is provided. We also discuss potential measurement problems and pitfalls, and suggest how such empirical data could subsequently be used to parameterize predictive photosynthetic models...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesPostoperative {{bloodstream}} {{infections are}} {{a major source of}} morbidity and increased health care costs. In adults, mediastinitis {{has been described as a}} risk factor for bloodstream infections. The objectives of this retrospective cohort study were to determine the incidence and to identify risk factors for postoperative bloodstream infections among children after median sternotomy in an urban tertiary care children’s hospital. MethodsFor this study, 192 patients were randomly selected from among all patients undergoing median sternotomy between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 2003. ResultsNinety-eight (51 %) of the 192 eligible patients were male. The median patient age was 5. 4 months (interquartile range: 1 day– 41. 5 years). Bloodstream infections occurred in 12 (6. 3 %; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 3. 3 %– 10. 7 %) patients within the first 30 days after median sternotomy. Bloodstream infections developed a median of 11 days (range: 3 – 29 days) after median sternotomy. Gram-negative bacilli caused 6 (50 %) of the 12 bloodstream infections. Specific causes of bloodstream infections included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 3), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 3), Pseudomonas fluorescens-putida (n = 2), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), Serratia marcescens (n = 1), and Candida albicans (n = 1). Multivariable analysis revealed that the development of mediastinitis (odds ratio [OR], 28. 16; 95 % CI, 3. 37 – 235. 22) and the requirement for postoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OR, 12. 52; 95 % CI, 2. 99 – 52. 41) were associated with bloodstream infections after median sternotomy. ConclusionsPostoperative bloodstream infections occurred in 6. 3 % of children undergoing median sternotomy. Postoperative mediastinitis and the requirement for extracorporeal membrane <b>oxygenation</b> were risk <b>factors</b> for bloodstream infections after median sternotomy. These findings warrant exploration in a larger, multicenter study...|$|R
40|$|Inspiratory muscle fatigue, {{a common}} event in {{patients}} {{in the intensive care}} unit, is under multifactorial control. To test the hypothesis that systemic <b>oxygenation</b> is a <b>factor</b> in this event, we subjected five healthy males (age 42 +/- 3 yr) to continuous inspiratory pressure (75 % of maximal inspiratory pressure, - 95 +/- 5 cmH 2 O) {{with the use of a}} controlled breathing pattern while they breathed normoxic (21 % O 2), hyperoxic (30 % O 2), and hypoxic (13 % O 2) mixtures. Inspiratory muscle endurance (IME; time that pressure could be maintained) and other cardiorespiratory parameters were monitored. Room air IME (3. 3 +/- 0. 4 min) was shortened (P < 0. 05) during 13 % O 2 breathing (1. 6 +/- 0. 4 min) but was unaffected during 30 % O 2 breathing (4. 0 +/- 0. 6 min). Inspiratory loading lowered the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) during the 21 and 30 % O 2 trials (1. 02 +/- 0. 01 to 0. 80 +/- 0. 03 % and 1. 05 +/- 0. 05 to 0. 69 +/- 0. 01 %, respectively) but not during the 13 % O 2 trials (1. 03 +/- 0. 03 to 1. 06 +/- 0. 07 %). At the point of fatigue during the 13 % O 2 trials, RER was lower compared with the same time point during the 21 and 30 % O 2 trials. A significant relationship was observed between IME and RER (r = - 0. 73, P = 0. 002) but not between IME and any of the other measured variables. We conclude that 1) hypoxemia impairs the ability of the inspiratory muscles to sustain a mechanical challenge and 2) substrate utilization of the respiratory muscles shifts toward a greater reliance on lipid metabolism when O 2 is readily available; this shift was not observed when the O 2 supply was reduced...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Placental {{malfunction}} in preeclampsia {{is believed}} to be a consequence of aberrant differentiation of trophoblast lineages and changes in utero-placental <b>oxygenation.</b> The transcription <b>factor</b> Snail, a master regulator molecule of epithelial-mesenchymal transition in embryonic development and in cancer, is shown to be involved in trophoblast differentiation as well. Moreover, Snail can be controlled by oxidative stress and hypoxia. Therefore, we examined the expression of Snail and its downstream target, e-cadherin, in human normal term, preterm and preeclamptic placentas, and in pregnant rats that developed preeclampsia-like symptoms in the response to a 20 -fold increase in sodium intake. Methods Western blotting analysis was used for comparative expression of Snail and e- cadherin in total protein extracts. Placental cells expressing Snail and e-cadherin were identified by immunohistochemical double-labeling technique. Results The levels of Snail protein were decreased in human preeclamptic placentas by 30 % (p compared to normal term, and in the rat model by 40 % (p compared to control placentas. In preterm placentas, the levels of Snail expression varied, yet there was a strong trend toward statistical significance between preterm and preeclamptic placentas. In humans, e-cadherin protein level was 30 % higher in preeclamptic (p placentas and similarly, but not significantly (p = 0. 1), high in the preterm placentas compared to normal term. In the rat model of preeclampsia, e-cadherin was increased by 60 % (p. Immunohistochemical examination of human placentas demonstrated Snail-positive staining in the nuclei of the villous trophoblasts and mesenchymal cells and in the invasive trophoblasts of the decidua. In the rat placenta, the majority of Snail positive cells were spongiotrophoblasts of the junctional zone, while in the labyrinth, Snail-positive sinusoidal giant trophoblasts cells were found in some focal areas located close to the junctional zone. Conclusion We demonstrated that human preeclampsia and the salt-induced rat model of preeclampsia are associated with the reduced levels of Snail protein in placenta. Down-regulation of the transcription factor Snail in placental progenitor cell lineages, either by intrinsic defects and/or by extrinsic and maternal factors, may affect normal placenta development and function and thus contribute to the pathology of preeclampsia. </p...|$|R
