40|$|The {{feasibility}} {{and potential}} advantages of wind tunnel testing of <b>otter</b> <b>board</b> designs are assessed. Traditional flume tank tests incur high operational costs and present some limitations {{in terms of}} flexibility and accuracy. Modern flume tanks, despite more flexible and accurate, are still expensive to operate or hire. Wind tunnel facilities are widespread, with a potential for low budget tests, and allow for an accurate control of velocity, angle of attack and sideslip as well as precise measurement of forces and moments in all three axes. A complete description of <b>otter</b> <b>board</b> hydrodynamics is paramount to optimising design and rigging and {{for the design of}} active control strategies that allow for stable trawling at a target speed and depth.

40|$|To obtain some {{fundamental}} suggestions on the gear-efficiency {{of the two}} different types of trawl net, the authors carried out the model experiment, and compared them with each other, basing on the physical characters of the net. The one is a six-seam net used on board of the 2 ̆ 7 Keiten Maru"" (854. 55 GT) for catching the demersal fishes: and here the <b>otter</b> <b>board</b> was rigged between the hand rope and the warp. The other one is shrimp trawl net used on board of the ""Satsunan"" (116. 57 GT) : and the <b>otter</b> <b>board</b> was directly rigged to the wing-tip in a traditional type. The results obtained in this study are summarized as follows. (1) In ordinary towing condition, the height of the net mouth of the six-seam net and the shrimp trawl net, marked 3. 5 m and 1 m, respectively. In six-seam net the height of the net mouth (h) can be expressed in the following formula, h= (0. 15 - 0. 053 V) l. where l is maximum breadth of the net mouth without shrinkage in (m), and V is towing speed in (m/sec) when the distance between both wing-tips is about 30 m. In shrimp trawl net, the maximum height of the net mouth is limited by the <b>otter</b> <b>board</b> height. ""(2) The bag net and net shape of the six-seam net look like cigar-shaped and in shrimp trawl net it is conical shaped but short. These are concerned with the planning of the net design. (3) The net resistance of six-seam net is larger than that of shrimp trawl net. At ordinary towing condition the net resistance of six-seam net, marked in 3. 1 7. 0 ton. In shrimp trawl net it marked about 105 275 kg. This difference of the net resistance depends on the scale of each net.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{ascertain}} the behaviour of Net fishing gear submerged in the water as well as that of the fish schools against the gear, by means of diving and camera snap shotting. Basing on the 12 times repeated experiments on board the training ship of our Faculty, named NANSEI MARU (83 ton, 400 P. S) the present study was carried out in October, 1984 and in May, 1985 at the sea-front which is 38 ~ 62 m deep and situated on the ocean lying west of Tane island. The behaviours of Net fishing gear under the trawling condition and those of the fish schools on the point of entering the gear were snapped by the low illumination diving television cameras attatched both at the <b>otter</b> <b>board</b> and at the Net mouth. The results obtained were as follow : (1) The figure of the <b>otter</b> <b>board</b> at the commencement of the towing, showed a slight slanting one, turned a little inwardly at the horizontal view and ackwardly at the vertical view, being influenced by the drawing force coming from the upward and insidely directed workings of the towing line; the Net trawling velocity being 2 knots, without any amount of wavering motion, being stable as thoroughly as possible. Net mouth was kept open regularly, wavering was reduced to almost zero. The hanging chains attatched the fishing line became detatched 5 ~ 10 cm from the sea bottom, showing the figure expected to appear on the design. A big amount of smoking mud was brought up out of the hanging chains, the iron balls attatched both at the fishing line and <b>otter</b> <b>board,</b> which prevented the fish schools from escaping out of the net-mouth, thus promoting the catching effect of the trawl net. (2) In the experiments carried out in May of 1985, the number of the fish observed was nine near the <b>otter</b> <b>board,</b> and fifty in the vicinity of the net mouth, respectively. Almost all the fish kept themselves swimming 30 ~ 50 cm in front of the fishing line of the net mouth, showing the same direction as that of the Net, for a long time. Of these fish, such big sized ones with fork length about 70 cm as Thick lip bream Plectorhynchus pictus and Rock bream Oplegnathus fasciatus made tumbling motions just above the fishing line of the net mouth, and then transferred themselves into the Net while the small sized fish were threatened by the tail movements of the big sized ones to be induced into the interior of the Net. 1984 年 10 月と 1985 年 5 月,種子島西方海域の水深 38 ~ 62 mの海域において,本学練習船南星丸(83 トン, 400 P.

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>otter</b> <b>boards</b> on the catches of Metapenaeus macleayi were {{quantified}} within the broad aim of promoting more hydrodynamic and environmentally benign trawl-spreading mechanisms.

Both trawl configurations had the same total weight (143 kg) and initial wing-end spreads (predicted means of 4. 33 and 4. 45 m), although the <b>otter</b> <b>boards</b> caused significantly more variable wing-end spread during towing. Replacing the <b>otter</b> <b>boards</b> with the beam significantly reduced system drag (by 10 %) and the weights and numbers of school prawns per hectare swept by the footropes (by 33 %); with the latter attributed to the concomitant reduction in lateral bottom contact of the system. Standardised catches of the most abundant teleost Herklotsichthys castelnaui were also significantly lower (by 79 %) in the beam trawl. The results support the potential for compensatory adjustments to penaeid-trawl parameters (e. g. footrope length) to offset reductions in the bottom contact of spreading mechanisms that are modified to minimise drag and/or habitat impacts...|$|R

40|$|The W trawl is a {{proposed}} innovation for more eco-efficient penaeid trawling-via reduced energy intensity and benthic contact.

This configuration facilitates substantially smaller otter boards than normal, and consequently less drag and seabed contact.

40|$|Free-ranging marine predators rarely {{search for}} prey along {{straight}} lines because dynamic ocean processes usually require complex search strategies.

However, recent fine scale tracking of flying seabirds has revealed straight-line movements while birds followed fishing vessels. Unlike flying seabirds, penguins are not known to target and follow fishing vessels. Yet yellow-eyed penguins from New Zealand often exhibit directed movement patterns while searching for prey at the seafloor, a behaviour that seems to contradict common movement ecology theories.

40|$|For prawn {{trawling}} systems, drag {{reduction is}} a high priority as the trawling process is ener-gy intensive. Large benefits have occurred {{through the use of}} multiple-net rigs and thin twine in the netting. An additional positive effect of these successful twine-area reduction strategies is the reduced amount of <b>otter</b> <b>board</b> area required to spread the trawl systems, which leads to further drag reduction. The present work investigated the potential of redi-recting the drag-strain within a prawn trawl away from the wings and the otter boards to the centre line of the trawl, where top and bottom tongues have been installed, with an aim to minimise the loading/size of the otter boards required to spread the trawl. In the system con-taining the new ‘W ’ trawl, the drag redirected to the centre-line tongues is transferred for-ward through a connected sled and towing wires to the trawler. To establish the extent of drag redirection to the centre-line tongues and the relative drag benefits of the new trawl system, conventional and ‘W ’ trawls of 3. 65 m headline length were tested firstly over a range of spread ratios in the flume tank, and subsequently at optimum spread ratio in the field. The developed ‘W ’ trawl effectively directed 64 % of netting-drag off the wings and onto the centre tongues, which resulted in drag savings in the field of* 20 % for the associated ‘W ’ trawl/otter-board/sled system compared to the traditional trawl/otter-board arrangement in a single trawl or twin rig configuration.

The mouth of the net is held open vertically by the use of floats attached to the headline, while weight distributed along the ground rope allows the net to make good contact with the sea floor.
