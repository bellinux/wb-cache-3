Existing techniques support {{the analysis of}} individual days <b>of</b> <b>incident</b> solar energy. In this paper a technique that uses Stochastic programming is proposed. The new technique allows the probability of occurrence of a particular day <b>of</b> <b>incident</b> solar energy, and the probability occurrence of particular consecutive days <b>of</b> <b>incident</b> solar energy to be considered by the optimisation process. The technique outlined supports the pre processing <b>of</b> <b>incident</b> solar energy and system loads as discrete probability functions which subsequently allows simple linear programming techniques to be utilised. This results {{in the ability to}} create easy to modify and easily scalable design tools...|$|R

50|$|Euler's {{proof of}} the degree sum formula uses the {{technique}} of double counting: he counts the number <b>of</b> <b>incident</b> pairs (v,e) where e is an edge and vertex v {{is one of its}} endpoints, in two different ways. Vertex v belongs to deg(v) pairs, where deg(v) (the degree of v) is the number <b>of</b> edges <b>incident</b> to it. Therefore, the number <b>of</b> <b>incident</b> pairs is the sum of the degrees. However, each edge in the graph belongs to exactly two incident pairs, one for each of its endpoints; therefore, the number <b>of</b> <b>incident</b> pairs is 2|E|. Since these two formulas count the same set of objects, they must have equal values.|$|R
5|$|Cemeteries, {{including}} those of war dead, are targets for vandalism. The gravestones, cemeteries and buildings of the Commission are no exception.

5|$|A UTI affects {{parts of}} the urinary system {{including}} the urethra, bladder, and kidneys. There is about a one percent risk of UTIs in boys under two years of age, and the majority <b>of</b> <b>incidents</b> occur {{in the first year}} of life. There is good but not ideal evidence that circumcision of babies reduces the incidence of UTIs in boys under two years of age, and there is fair evidence that the reduction in incidence is by a factor of 310 times (100 circumcisions prevents one UTI). Prevention of UTIs does not justify routine use of the procedure, however. Circumcision is most likely to benefit boys who have a high risk of UTIs due to anatomical defects, and may be used to treat recurrent UTIs.|$|E

5|$|In May 2006, an {{anonymous}} {{letter from the}} Ministry of Information was circulated within the party, stating Ranariddh's purported intention {{to form a new}} royalist party. Nhek Bun Chhay followed the issue closely and provided a list of party members who were planning to defect from Funcinpec, which included Serey Kosal and Chakrapong. At the same time, Nhek Bun Chhay appointed Nouv Sovathero party spokesman, while re-designating the then-incumbent party spokesman Chea Chanboribo the personal spokesman for Ranariddh. The cascade <b>of</b> <b>incidents</b> from Nhek Bun Chhay stoked anger from Serey Kosal and Chakrapong who threatened to sue him. When Ranariddh was fired from his position as the president of Funcinpec in October 2006, Chakrapong was also expelled from the party and senate the following month.|$|E

On 25 May 1969, a KC-135A (56–3602) broke in two after aborting takeoff. The cause was a frozen water injection surge tube. On 19 July 1970, a B-52G (58‑0208) also caught on fire and was destroyed on the ground.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the French government's anger against Morocco was increasing. A series <b>of</b> <b>incidents</b> in October 1849 damaged {{relations}} between both countries; {{a series of}} assassinations directed at the French frontier had occurred, and the French Consul had requested the dismissal of Pacha Ouchda, who was believed to have caused these issues. From 1845 to 1851, Morocco had a serious agricultural crisis caused by a drought, resulting in crop failure. The people of Morocco were suffering {{as the price of}} wheat and barley reached unprecedented heights. In Salé, many people were starving, and the agricultural crisis and anger towards France ultimately led to the bombardment of Salé.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} a number <b>of</b> <b>incidents</b> in recent years where the river has been {{polluted}} and fish have been killed. In 2004 a pipe was broken by builders while they were working on the upgrade of the Fofanny water treatment works, near the source of the river. This resulted in sediment running into the river and the flooding of the plant. Fish were not directly harmed by this incident, and the Water Service carried out an investigation to assure drinking water had not been affected. However, concerns were raised by the Shimna Anglers Club that {{this was not the first}} time building work had affected the river, and that there was the possibility of long term harm to the salmon and sea trout.|$|E

40|$|The {{occurrence}} <b>of</b> an <b>incident</b> is one <b>of</b> {{the main}} causes of traffic congestion and delay on urban freeways. Currently, {{the development of}} an efficient traffic incident management process is an emerging issue in intelligent transport systems. The focus {{of this study is to}} develop an incident response model for use in an incident management program designed to reduce incident related traffic congestion and delays. Establishing a fuzzy control system based on a real operation process <b>of</b> <b>incident</b> response would help decrease the workload of operators who are constantly making essential decisions, and would be helpful in developing a more reliable operation procedure. Traffic incident data obtained from traffic detectors and information systems on freeways should be considered in order to determine the best form of operation. In this study, a fuzzy incident response model is formulated in terms <b>of</b> <b>incident,</b> type <b>of</b> vehicle, type <b>of</b> <b>incident</b> vehicle, location <b>of</b> <b>incident</b> vehicle, and incident service time. In order to analyze the reliability of the proposed model, the application of the model is made using the actual incident data collected on the freeway in the Los Angeles area. The application of the model shows that the fuzzy incident response system is very effective in describing the actual judgment <b>of</b> the <b>incident</b> operators in terms <b>of</b> <b>incident</b> service time...|$|R

5|$|At 12:50, a force {{comprising}} {{elements of}} the 121st and 125th Home Guard regiments and the 265th Reconnaissance-Sabotage Company managed to cross the Sava River at {{the confluence of the}} Sava and Una. The crossing force of 80 soldiers, encountered a minefield, VRS artillery fire and small arms fire from bunkers near the river bank. Extraction of the force began after 14:00, leading to an exchange of heavy artillery fire between the VRS on one bank and the 121st and the 125th Home Guard regiments' battlegroups on the other. The withdrawal required several river crossings using the available boats, and resulted in further losses. The situation was further complicated for the HV but a number <b>of</b> <b>incidents</b> and factors. These included a tugboat towing a damaged amphibious vehicle which caught fire because of faulty wiring, insufficient fire support from river gunboats, and boat crews provided by the 34th Engineer Battalion who refused to cross the river against VRS fire and had to be replaced by conscripts of the 33rd Engineer Battalion. Despite HV use of unmanned aerial vehicles to locate the VRS guns as targets for counter-battery fire, the artillery exchange continued late into the night of 19/20 September.|$|E
