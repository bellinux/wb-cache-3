25|$|The {{new social}} {{movements}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixties,</b> {{such as the}} Black Power and anti-Vietnam war movements in the US, the May 1968 insurrection in France, and Women's Liberation throughout the Western world, inspired many LGBT activists to become more radical, and the Gay Liberation movement emerged {{towards the end of}} the decade.

25|$|Though Britpop {{is viewed}} as a {{marketing}} tool, and more of a cultural moment than a musical style or genre, there are musical conventions and influences the bands grouped under the Britpop term have in common, such as showing elements from the British pop music <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sixties,</b> glam rock and punk rock of the Seventies, and indie pop of the Eighties in their music. Britpop was a media driven focus on bands which emerged from the independent music scene of the early 1990s—and was associated with the British popular cultural movement of Cool Britannia which evoked the Swinging Sixties and the British guitar pop music of that decade.|$|E
25|$|On March 14, 1960 Breda {{was shocked}} to hear the death of Antoon ‘De Rat’ Verlegh.

From NAC’s foundation in 1912, Verlegh was involved in the club at numerous positions and played an important role with the Royal Dutch Football Association. In November 1961 NAC lost another important person; Chairman Jacques Piederiet died. A year later, in August 1962, chairman Le Fevre died.

25|$|After 1948, however, Appel {{remained}} {{in contact with}} his old comrades, both in the Netherlands and elsewhere, among others with Internationalisme, predecessor of the International Communist Current, {{at the end of}} the forties and during the fifties. That’s why Jan Appel was once again present at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixties</b> at the founding of Revolution Internationale, the future section in France of the ICC, and a product of the massive struggles of the proletariat in 1968. Since then with numerous visits from comrades and sympathisers of the ICC, Jan Appel contributed to the formation of a new generation of revolutionaries, participating at the formal constitution of the ICC in 1976, one last time, thereby passing on the torch and the lessons of one generation of revolutionaries to another. Jan Appel, died on 4 May 1985 at the age of 95.|$|E

25|$|Thirty years later, the 1960s {{ushered in}} a {{turbulent}} period for St. Paul's. In 1968, students wrote an acerbic manifesto describing the school administration as an oppressive regime. As {{a result of this}} manifesto, seated meals were reduced from three times a day to four times a week, courses were shortened to be terms (rather than years) long, Chapel was reduced to four times a week, and the school's grading system was changed to eliminate + and- grades and given its current High Honors, Honors, High Pass, Pass, and Unsatisfactory labels instead of A–F. By the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixties,</b> St. Paul's had begun to admit sizable numbers of minorities in every class, had secularized its previously strict religious schedule considerably, expanded its course offerings, and was poised to begin coeducation. It admitted girls {{for the first time in}} 1971.|$|E
25|$|The {{writings}} of Antonio Gramsci and Herbert Marcuse were drawn upon. Gramsci wrote on power, cultural and ideological conflicts {{in society and}} institutions—real-time class struggles playing out in rapidly developing industrial nation states through interlinked areas of political behavior, Marcuse on coercion and hegemony in that cultural indoctrination and ideological manipulation through the means of communication ("repressive tolerance") dispensed {{with the need for}} complete brute force in modern 'liberal democracies'. His One-Dimensional Man was addressed to the restive students <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixties.</b> Marcuse argued that only marginal groups of students and poor alienated workers could effectively resist the system. Both Gramsci and Marcuse {{came to the conclusion that}} the ideological underpinnings and the 'superstructure' of society was vitally important in the understanding of class control (and acquiescence). This could perhaps be seen as an extension of Marx's work as he did not cover this area in detail. Das Kapital, his mainly economic work, was meant to be one of a series of books which would have included one on society and one on the state, but his death prevented fulfilment of this.|$|E
25|$|Though Britpop is seen {{retrospectively}} as {{a marketing}} tool, {{and more of a}} cultural moment than a musical style or genre, there are musical conventions and influences the bands grouped under the Britpop term have in common. Britpop bands show elements from the British pop music <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sixties,</b> glam rock and punk rock of the Seventies, and indie pop of the Eighties in their music, attitude, and clothing. Specific influences vary: Blur and Oasis drew from the Kinks and the Beatles, respectively, while Elastica had a fondness for arty punk rock. Regardless, Britpop artists project a sense of reverence for British pop sounds of the past. Alternative rock acts from the indie scene of the Eighties and early Nineties were the direct ancestors of the Britpop movement. The influence of the Smiths is common to the majority of Britpop artists. The Madchester scene, fronted by the Stone Roses, Happy Mondays and Inspiral Carpets (for whom Oasis's Noel Gallagher had worked as a roadie during the Madchester years), was an immediate root of Britpop since its emphasis on good times and catchy songs provided an alternative to the British-based shoegazing and American based grunge styles of music.|$|E
