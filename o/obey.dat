To a man, Division Eight chose to <b>obey</b> all orders. Divisions Two and Four were split by the decisions of their men: Small and 43 others chose to form a group unwilling to <b>obey</b> every order. These 44 were taken back to the brig and the remaining 214 were sent to barracks. On the morning of August 12, six men from Divisions Two and Four who had put themselves in the obey-all-orders group {{failed to show up}} for work call; these six were confined to the brig, making 50 prisoners in all. These 50 were identified by the Navy as mutineers.|$|E

5|$|In {{physical}} systems, Noether's theorem {{provides an}} equivalence between conservation laws and symmetries of the system. However, for cellular automata this theorem {{does not directly}} apply, because instead of being governed by {{the energy of the}} system the behavior of the automaton is encoded into its rules, and the automaton is guaranteed to <b>obey</b> certain symmetries (translation invariance in both space and time) regardless of any conservation laws it might <b>obey.</b> Nevertheless, the conserved quantities of certain reversible systems behave similarly to energy in some respects. For instance, if different regions of the automaton have different average values of some conserved quantity, the automaton's rules may cause this quantity to dissipate, so that the distribution of the quantity is more uniform in later states. Using these conserved quantities as a stand-in for the energy of the system can allow it to be analyzed using methods from classical physics.|$|E
