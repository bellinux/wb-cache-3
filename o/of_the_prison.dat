5|$|The 1990 Strangeways Prison riot was a 25-day prison riot and rooftop protest at Strangeways Prison in Manchester, England. The riot {{began on}} 1 April 1990 when prisoners took control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prison</b> chapel, and the riot quickly spread {{throughout}} most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prison.</b> The riot and rooftop protest ended on 25 April {{when the final}} five prisoners {{were removed from the}} rooftop, making it the longest prison riot in British penal history. One prisoner was killed during the riot, and 147 prison officers and 47 prisoners were injured.

5|$|The {{government}} department in charge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prison</b> underwent several reorganisations in the 1970s and 1980s, but {{the culture of}} Fremantle Prison was resistant to change. Growing prisoner discontent culminated in a 1988 riot with guards taken hostage, and a fire that caused $1.8 million worth of damage. The prison closed in 1991, replaced by the new maximum-security Casuarina Prison. Since 1991, the prison has been conserved as a recognised heritage site on state, national, and World Heritage lists, and various restoration works have been undertaken since the 1990s. New uses have been found for various sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prison,</b> including a New Business Enterprise Centre in the New Division cell block, and wedding ceremonies in the prison chapels. It has also become a significant tourist attraction, with guided tours since 1991.|$|E
