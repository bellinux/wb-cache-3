5|$|Initial {{writing for}} the first season was split between the Wachowskis and Straczynski. The Wachowskis wrote episodes one, two, three, seven and eight while Straczynski wrote episodes four, five, six, nine and ten. Then the Wachowskis rewrote Straczynski's scripts and vice versa. Straczynski said {{a good portion of}} the writing was done by just Lana and himself. Straczynski {{believes}} writing with the Wachowskis helped mask each other's weaknesses and also allowed each party to learn from the other. He recognizes action and plot as their biggest strengths but structure as their weakness. On the other hand, he views himself as really good on structure but weak on action. Straczynski said the way he works is by first developing the entire script in his head, from the first sentence to the last, before sitting down to write it, while the Wachowskis begin by writing the scenes they have already developed, leaving the others they haven't figured <b>out</b> <b>yet</b> for later, while they constantly move the pieces around to see in which way they work best.|$|E
5|$|McMurray and Montoya {{continued}} to lead {{for the next}} three laps, as 14 teams were repairing their cars in the garage after the lap 29 crash. On lap39, Keselowski retook the lead, after having assistance from Regan Smith. Three laps later, Johnson was preparing to return to the race. On lap43, Stewart took the lead one lap before Keselowski retook it from him. On lap 45th, Bowyer became the quickest in the race with a speed of over 200mph. Two laps later, Robert Richardson, Jr. spun off the bumper of Travis Kvapil, bringing <b>out</b> <b>yet</b> the fifth caution. He sustained major damage to his car in the accident. Under caution, the leaders made pit stops, giving the first and second positions to Terry Labonte and Dave Blaney at the restart. On lap51, Kurt Busch led before Menard overtook him.|$|E

Australia had reached 172-5 by the close, mainly thanks to O'Neill, who was the fifth man out at 155.|$|E

25|$|Chamlee, too, {{found little}} {{economic}} reason {{to move into}} the city and concluded {{that it would have been}} more profitable to rent the H Street boarding house entirely to lodgers. The city was also a more dangerous and morally-challenging place for her daughter, and Surratt had striven to keep Anna away from such influences, such as her husband, for years. Moreover, Surratt still owed money on both the tavern and the townhouse and would take <b>out</b> <b>yet</b> another mortgage against the townhouse in January 1865.|$|E

25|$|Donegal: La Trinidad Valencera (1,000 tons, Levant squadron, 360 men, 42 guns) {{had taken}} on more water than could be pumped <b>out.</b> <b>Yet</b> as she {{approached}} the coast she managed to rescue 264 men from the Barca de Amburgo, another ship swamped in the heavy seas. Trinidad anchored in Glenagivney Bay, where she listed {{to such a degree}} that the order was given to abandon ship. Some locals were paid for the use of a small boat, and over the course of two days all 560 men were ferried to shore.|$|E

Iolanthe, Jack, Pooh, Vulture, Scimitar, Astro and Stretch are captured by American forces, whilst the others escape in the damaged Halicarnassus.|$|E
25|$|Les Baigneuses—as Robert Delaunay's 1912 City of Paris, and to {{some extent}} Jean Metzinger's 1913 Meudon Landscape—juxtaposes sharply {{contrasting}} elements. On the one hand the artist includes elements from a society in the process of inexorable industrialization, and on the other, the sereneness of timeless classical nude figures (something rarely painted by Gleizes, as Brooke points <b>out).</b> <b>Yet</b> the relationships between the two are formally resolved. This aspect of simultaneity—the optimistic reconciliation of classical tradition and contemporary life—was of particular interest to Gleizes, as it was to the Section d'Or group of Cubists (also known as the Passy group, or Puteaux group).|$|E

25|$|Earlier {{studies of}} mantle-derived rocks from many places {{have shown that}} {{hydrocarbons}} from the mantle region can be found widely around the globe. However, the content of such hydrocarbons in such rocks are extremely low and seem to lack accumulation in concentrations that would render them feasible for exploitation. Scientific consensus {{on the origin of}} oil and gas is that all natural oil and gas deposits on Earth are fossil fuels and are, therefore, biogenic. Globally significant amounts of abiotic oil in the crust can even be ruled <b>out.</b> <b>Yet,</b> abiogenesis of small quantities of oil and gas remains an area of ongoing research in limited, mostly just laboratory, scale.|$|E
25|$|On Tuesday, January 25, 1949, Scott {{collapsed}} {{and went into}} hysterics on the RKO set of The Big Steal (1949). She immediately quit {{after three days of}} production. According to Scott's replacement, Jane Greer, Scott quit because she was concerned about being associated with the leading man, Robert Mitchum, who at the time was jailed at the local honor farm for a marijuana conviction—Mitchum was convicted January 10, 1949. It was also later alleged that Hal Wallis was supposedly responsible for Scott's bowing <b>out.</b> <b>Yet,</b> Scott starred with Mitchum in a RKO film two years later. During this same period, the press reported rumors of Scott's stage fright, an ailment common to actors. Scott herself has admitted to stage fright, explaining her absence during premieres of her films.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} time in 'Australian Idol' history there were 13 finalists. This came about during the Wildcard Verdict show on 5 September 2005. The judges {{initially}} chose James Kannis and Emily Williams to go through to the final. This left one spot which was chosen by the Australian public. Out of the remaining contestants the two that received the highest votes were Daniel Spillane and Roxane Lebrasse. With only 1% between them, Dan was announced as the final member of the Top 12. This meant Roxane had missed <b>out</b> <b>yet</b> again. The judges decided however that Roxane was too good to be left out of the Top 12 so they made it a Top 13. The catch was that two contestants were eliminated {{in the first round of}} the finals.|$|E

25|$|The Cyclones {{continued}} their success under McCarney in the 2005 season. High points {{during the season}} include a blowout win against #8 Iowa and a home victory over #22 Colorado. They missed <b>out</b> <b>yet</b> again on the Big 12 title when they lost in overtime to the Kansas after a missed field goal by Bret Culbertson. They led {{the game in the}} 4th quarter but allowed Kansas to come back. They got a berth in the 2005 Houston Bowl, but lost 24–27 to the TCU Horned Frogs. TCU opened the game with back-to-back first quarter rushing touchdowns. The Cyclones responded with two Bret Meyer touchdown passes and by forcing a TCU safety. Late in the fourth quarter the game was tied at 24–24 but the Cyclones ultimately lost yet another bowl game on a fourth quarter field goal.|$|E
25|$|The 2014–15 {{season was}} Arsenal's 23rd {{season in the}} Premier League and 95th {{consecutive}} season in the top flight of English football. This season Arsenal participated in the Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup, Community Shield and the UEFA Champions League. An inconsistent start to the league season ended any realistic hopes for the Premier League title as Arsenal only won two out of their first eight games. Inconsistency plagued Arsenal throughout {{the first half of}} the campaign, not helped by numerous injuries to important players. At one stage, Arsenal were as low as eighth heading into early December. This would later haunt them as they mounted a superb recovery during the second half of the season where they won eight league games in a row, becoming the in-form side of the division. Ultimately, however, the gap between themselves and leaders Chelsea was too much, the points dropped during the inconsistent first half of the season proving too much to recover. Old habits were hard to eradicate in Europe as yet again, Arsenal were their own worst enemies. Despite being widely expected to reach the quarter-finals, having been given a favourable draw in the Round of 16 against AS Monaco, Arsenal self-destructed at home, where panic led to Monaco winning the first leg 1–3, a scoreline which ultimately proved fatal over the course of the tie. Arsenal, with their 0–2 away win proving useless, bowed <b>out</b> <b>yet</b> again in the round of sixteen for the fifth consecutive year. However, Arsenal reclaimed the FA Cup, thus becoming the most successful club in the history of the competition with twelve wins, comfortably beating Aston Villa 4–0 in the final. Arsenal finished the league season in third, thereby qualifying directly to Champions league group stage and avoiding the Champions League qualifier, something Arsène Wenger was keen to avoid as he felt it had a negative impact on competing for the Premier League title, which was the primary target set by the players, manager and coaching staff, going into the next season.|$|E

500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{announced}} that Lewis {{had been working}} on the album in February 2008. Prior to Acid Tongues release, Lewis allowed listeners to hear the title track by calling the toll-free telephone number 1-888-717-ACID. The song was later replaced by a recording announcing two [...] "secret" [...] performances in September, including a password and website to obtain tickets. Additionally, several videos were put up on Lewis' official YouTube page. The videos show Lewis (or band mates) at home being visited by Ben Gibbard, of Death Cab for Cutie and The Postal Service, who has arrived with balloons to listen to the new album. Ben is told that the album isn't <b>out</b> <b>yet,</b> but Lewis agrees to let him hear [...] "just one song". This is followed by a recording of the title track [...] "Acid Tongue." ...|$|E
500|$|Observations by the {{orbiting}} Microvariability and Oscillations of STars telescope initially {{limited the}} planet's albedo (or reflectivity) below 0.3, {{making it a}} surprisingly dark object. (The geometric albedo has since been measured to be 0.038 ± 0.045.) In comparison, Jupiter has a much higher albedo of 0.52. This would suggest that HD 209458 b's upper cloud deck is either made of less reflective material than is Jupiter's, or else has no clouds and Rayleigh-scatters incoming radiation like Earth's dark ocean. Models since then have shown that between {{the top of its}} atmosphere and the hot, high pressure gas surrounding the mantle, there exists a stratosphere of cooler gas. [...] This implies an outer shell of dark, opaque, hot cloud; usually thought to consist of vanadium and titanium oxides like red dwarfs ("pM planets"), but other compounds like tholins cannot be ruled <b>out</b> <b>yet.</b> The Rayleigh-scattering heated hydrogen rests {{at the top of the}} stratosphere; the absorptive portion of the cloud deck floats above it at 25 millibars.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} Tom Haverford also undergoes {{changes during}} the final episodes of the season, in which the character begins to consider leaving his city hall position to pursue his own business ambitions. The storyline is advanced particularly strongly in [...] "The Bubble", when Tom becomes frustrated with an assignment by Chris, and culminates in the season finale [...] "Li'l Sebastian", in which he ultimately quits the parks department to form an entertainment company. [...] "Li'l Sebastian" [...] ends with several cliffhanger twists including Tom's departure from city hall, Leslie being approached to run for office, {{and the arrival of}} Ron's first ex-wife Tammy, although the actress who will play her was not revealed. Schur said the writing staff had a general idea of where the newly introduced storylines should go, but the exact stories had not been completely worked <b>out</b> <b>yet</b> when the episodes broadcast.
