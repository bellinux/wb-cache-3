5|$|In 2007, the Second Chance round {{became a}} full semifinal, {{taking place in}} a venue {{comparable}} in size to those hosting the others. The expanded Second Chance takes place <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Saturday</b> <b>night,</b> adding an extra week to the event's timetable. The format of voting also changed {{with the introduction of}} a knock-out system. The system pairs the eight songs off against each other, then narrows them down to four before pairing them off again. The winners of the two second round pairings go through to the final. The two finalists do not reprise their songs {{at the end of the}} programme.|$|E

5000|$|The {{other major}} feud heading into WrestleMania 2 was Randy [...] "Macho Man" [...] Savage and George [...] "the Animal" [...] Steele. Its genesis came after Steele, {{who used a}} Neanderthal, [...] "missing link"-type gimmick, became smitten with Savage's manager, the {{beautiful}} Miss Elizabeth (Savage's real-life wife, although unacknowledged on television). Their first meeting took place <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Saturday</b> <b>Night's</b> Main Event aired shortly before Savage won the Intercontinental Championship, and Steele would frequently be distracted by Elizabeth, which Savage used to his advantage. Along with former champion Tito Santana (who was on the Los Angeles portion of the event) Steele became one of Savage's top challengers for the title.|$|R

5|$|Before {{broadcasting}} began, the BBC considered airing {{the show}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Saturday</b> <b>night</b> timeslot as its research found that any potential viewers {{were less likely}} to watch television on Saturdays than most other nights of the week; the BBC hoped that Spooks would boost its timeslot. However, the series instead broadcast on Mondays. The series began broadcasting on 13 May 2002 on BBC One during the 9 to 10pm timeslot, and continued on every Monday night until 17 June 2002, {{with the exception of the}} fourth episode, which was viewed on Tuesday 4 June starting at 10pm, due to an overrun of the coverage of Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee. The episodes were also repeated on the digital channel BBC Choice. In the US, the first series aired in mid-2003 on A. However, each episode had approximately ten minutes edited out to accommodate for advert breaks. The DVD release of the series in America contained the uncut episodes. The first series was later repeated on BBC America, alongside the second series starting in June 2007.|$|E

25|$|George Peppard's screen {{presence}} {{has some}} agreeable anomalies. He is tough, assured and insolent – {{in a way}} that recalls late Dick Powell rather than early Bogart; but his bright blue eyes and blond hair, his boyish face suggest the all-American athlete, perhaps going to seed. The sophistication is surface deep: you can imagine him in Times Square <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Saturday</b> <b>night,</b> sulky, defiant, out of his depth, not quite certain how he wants to spend the evening.|$|E

25|$|On {{the night}} of 15 October 1977, Christine Eadie and Helen Scott were seen leaving the World's End Pub at closing time, the final stop <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Saturday</b> <b>night</b> pub crawl. The {{following}} day, Christine's naked body was discovered in Gosford Bay, East Lothian, by hill walkers. Helen's body was found unclothed six miles away from Christine's, in a corn-stubble field. Both girls had been beaten, gagged, tied, raped and strangled. No attempt {{had been made to}} conceal their bodies.|$|E
25|$|The Cougars {{opened their}} MVC {{schedule}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Saturday</b> <b>night</b> in Chicago at #17 Loyola {{in a battle}} of the top two defenses in the conference. As expected, both defenses repeatedly turned back their opponents' offenses. The game was scoreless into the 76th minute, when a Ramblers forward got his cleats on a perfectly placed crossing pass only five {{feet in front of}} the goal mouth for what would be the only score of the game. SIUE had two near misses at tying the score, including a Jambga shot off the post, but Loyola remained the only unbeaten, untied team in Division I.|$|E
25|$|The band holds tryouts usually {{two weeks}} before school starts. This is {{somewhat}} variable as the band staff tries to allow for members to perform in Drum Corps International World Championships in Indianapolis. In recent years, DCI Finals night was held <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Saturday</b> <b>night,</b> while OSUMB Candidate Days (for all prospective band members who have not made the band before) would begin the following Sunday morning. Due to a tighter schedule in 2016, Candidate Days were held during DCI Finals, and full band tryouts began the following morning. Typically this is avoided however, to allow incoming freshmen to finish a drum corps tour and then learn the OSU style in the two days prior to full band tryouts. Once the band is picked and until school starts up, the band practices {{three times a day}} Monday through Friday. Once school starts, the band rehearses Monday-Friday from 4:10-6:15 PM. However, the Band Center doors are typically not locked until midnight, as many band members will do other classwork while practicing and memorizing their music for the week's show. Many shows must be learned in as little as four days, with all music and drill committed to memory.|$|E

25|$|The {{regular season}} closer had the 2nd place Cougars in 3rd place Evansville's house <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Saturday</b> <b>night.</b> SIUE's lead was a slim single point, with both teams still having an outside {{chance at the}} MVC title if Loyola should falter. The Cougars scored first when McLean beat two {{defenders}} and the Aces' keeper before netting his third goal {{of the season in}} the 12th minute. In the 30th minute, the Purple Aces got a pass to a man in the box, who managed to get it past Dal Santo to tie the score. Closing out a winning season after a couple of down years, Evansville was hungry for the win and really put the pressure on the SIUE defense, out-shooting the Cougars 20–8 with 10 shots on goal, but Dal Santo showed why he is again among the leaders of the NCAA goalkeepers' statistics by making nine saves. With the draw, the Cougars wound up the regular season with a ten-game unbeaten streak (7–0–3) after starting the season 1–4–2. They also secured second place in the Valley and a bye through to the semifinals of the 2016 Missouri Valley Conference Men's Soccer Tournament.|$|E

500|$|While some of {{the costumes}} for the New York shoot were {{prepared}} ahead of time, much of the costuming was done in New York, and the costumes for the episode received an Emmy Award nomination.

She said, [...] "We landed in New York <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Saturday</b> <b>night,</b> shopped all day Sunday, threw them in the clothes" [...] for the filming that began on Monday.

500|$|The {{scene where}} the crowd celebrates {{the turn of}} the new century {{at the end of the}} film was shot at the corner of the 5th and Flower streets, between the Westin Bonaventure Hotel and the Los Angeles Public Library. Over 50 off-duty police {{officers}} were hired to control an assembled crowd of 10,000 people, who had to pay $10 in advance to attend the event. The film-makers also hired rave promoters Moss Jacobs and Philip Blaine to produce performances featuring Aphex Twin, Deee-Lite, as well as [...] "all the cyber-techno bands they could garner". It was reported that a total of $750,000 was spent on the event, and half of the 1,300 rooms in the Bonaventure were rented out. The event started at 9 p.m. <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Saturday</b> <b>night</b> and ended shortly before its scheduled end at 4 a.m., as five people were hospitalized for suffering overdoses of the drug Ecstasy.|$|E

500|$|Gaga next {{performed}} [...] "Gypsy" [...] at her ArtRave {{concert in}} November 2013 at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, where she sang {{along with a}} live band. During the performance, Gaga gave a shout-out to artist Jeff Koons, who was heavily involved in the visuals related to the Artpop era and its campaigns, and dedicated the song to him. She again performed [...] "Gypsy" [...] on a piano <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Saturday</b> <b>Night</b> Live show later that month, wearing a rainbow colored leotard with giant shoulder pads. Around the one minute mark, when the tempo of the song changes from a ballad to its original anthemic composition, a band stepped onstage from the shadows behind as well as dancers, who danced and created a party atmosphere. Hillary Hughes of The Village Voice found similarities in Gaga's vocals to those of singer Lana Del Rey. She felt that [...] "Gaga plowed into 'Gypsy' with the aplomb of a Vegas lounge goddess from the future... Girl hit her notes, and well, and I'd take 'Gypsy' over 'Applause' or 'Born This Way' {{any day of the}} week, but 'Gypsy' on SNL {{was a bit of a}} confusing display from beginning to end." ...|$|E
500|$|Time Out {{gave the}} film a mostly {{positive}} review, writing, [...] "While Django remains the erratic Corbucci's best picture, this slightly later spaghetti Western does well by an inventive set-up [...] between the bullets there's engaging {{stuff from the}} two stars and an unmistakable chill in the air". Film critic Leonard Maltin praised the film, awarding it 3 1/2 {{out of a possible}} 4 stars. In his review he wrote that The Great Silence is a [...] "brutal, bleakly beautiful spaghetti Western filmed on stark locations in the Dolomites, {{with one of the most}} uncompromising and unforgettable finales ever filmed". Kyle Anderson of Nerdist News described the film as Corbucci's [...] "most artful and daring" [...] Western, one that [...] "pushes the genre to new levels and creates a story unlike anything people were used to, even though it's likely more historically accurate". He concluded his review by stating that [...] "If you're looking for a good time <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Saturday</b> <b>night,</b> I'd say this movie is not what you want, but if you're looking for a dark, violent, thoughtful, and well-made film, look no further".|$|E
500|$|Scott Matthewman, {{writing for}} The Stage, gave a mixed {{review of the}} episode. He thought that [...] "pretty much the only {{surprise}} {{in the way the}} humans who made up the Ood Corporation were presented came as PR girl Solana (Ayesha Dharker) escaped with the Doctor and Donna, only to betray their position by calling for the guards," [...] and [...] "the revelation that Ryder (Adrian Rawlins) has been working to infiltrate the Corporation is thrown away... as quickly as it is revealed." [...] However, he thought Donna was becoming [...] "fast... one of the strongest and most well-rounded companions in the series’ history", and [...] "there were some nice interpretations of the Ood’s natural development". Caitlin Moran of The Times thought the episode was [...] "really really good... – one that will have you staring at your screen and asking, once again, 'How can something so good be happening so early <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Saturday</b> <b>night,</b> in my own front room?'". She enjoyed the scene where the Doctor and Donna talk about slaves in contemporary culture, saying that Tate [...] "really, really isn’t that bad when she says [...] ". Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy gave the episode five stars out of five. Rawson-Jones opened his review by saying [...] "Doctor Who can occasionally transcend the properties of a mere family television show to reach out and give viewers a poignant, beautiful epiphany and greater sense of the world they inhabit," [...] citing Donna's reaction on seeing the uncultivated Ood as the moving part of the episode.|$|E
