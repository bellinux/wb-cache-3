40|$|Abstract Background <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> <b>sale</b> of {{antibiotics}} {{is a global}} problem and it is increasingly recognized {{as a source of}} antibiotic misuse and is believed to increase treatment costs, adverse effects of treatment and emergence of resistance. The increasing trend of <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> <b>sale</b> {{of antibiotics}} in Ethiopia calls for exploration of why such dispensing is practiced. This study aims to explore reasons for <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> <b>sale</b> of antibiotics in the community pharmacies of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Methods A phenomenological qualitative study was conducted in five randomly selected community pharmacies of Addis Ababa. One pharmacy professional from each pharmacy were interviewed at the spot using semi-structured, open-ended interview checklist. Besides, observation of professionals’ dispensing practice was made for at least one hour in the same community pharmacies using an observation checklist. Findings were categorized into specific themes that were developed following the objectives. This was facilitated by use of OpenCode 3. 6 software. Results All participants pointed out that antibiotics were frequently dispensed without prescription and contend that the trend of such dispensing has been increasing. The findings indicated that the nonprescription sales of antibiotics were common for Amoxicillin, Ciprofloxacin and Cotrimoxazole. The poor, less educated and younger groups of the population were reported to frequently request antibiotics without prescription. The main reasons for nonprescription sale of antibiotics by pharmacy professionals were found to be related to pharmacy owner’s influence to maximize revenue, customer’s pressure, weak regulatory mechanism and professional conflicts of interest. Conclusion The study shows that nonprescription sale of antibiotics was common practice at least in Addis Ababa. The main reasons for this malpractice were the need to maximize revenue and weak regulatory mechanism. Hence, strong regulatory enforcement and community awareness campaign is called for to limit nonprescription sale of antibiotics...|$|E
40|$|Background: A lot of {{cosmetic}} and Ayurvedic products containing unlabeled depigmenting {{agent and}} steroids are available readily <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> <b>sale.</b> The {{side effects of}} these products are not documented {{and can lead to}} adverse effects of continuous usage. Objective: By this study, we aimed to find out {{the true nature of the}} above problem and it′s implication in the Indian rural scenario. Methodology: All patients attending dermatology department during the period of 3 months from May to June 2013 for skin diseases were enquired about unsupervised use of any cosmetic product on their facial skin, duration of use, any side effect experienced through the prescribed questionnaire. Results: Total 50 patients were recruited for the study. Out of which, 48 % were males and 52 % were females. Seventy-four percent of people had applied topical products/steroids in an attempt of attainment of fair complexion, 14 % for melasma, 8 % for acne induced hyperpigmentation, and 4 % for dark circles.

40|$|Introduction: Despite {{the well}} defined law and highly liberal policy Government {{approved}} medical facilities {{are not the}} leading provider of abortion in Indian Scenario. Whether legally or not Pharmacists are already acting as provider of medical abortion for large {{number of women in}} India. Dispense of Medical abortion drugs via pharmacist has the advantages of convenience, relative anonymity, hasty transaction, easy accessibility and saving cost. Aims and Objectives: Objective of present study was to assess the <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> <b>sale</b> of medical abortion in terms of knowledge, attitude and practices of pharmacists of Delhi, India. Material and Methods: It was a cross sectional interview based study conducted in 110 pharmacies of 6 districts of State of Delhi. Results: A total of 75 pharmacists and 35 pharmacy workers were interviewed. Knowledge and practices of all of them was inadequate in some aspects. 68 % knew Medical abortion is legal and 57 % thought that <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> <b>sale</b> of drugs of medical abortion is also legal. Only 40. 9 % knew the correct regimen of mifepristone + misoprostol combination. Most of them is not aware of any serious side effects and failure rate. Their attitude is indifferent towards the clients but positive towards training in updating knowledge if given option. Conclusion: Their knowledge, attitude and practices while dispensing drugs for medical abortion were inappropriate to qualify them as an independent mid level provider in present scenario. Unregulated OTC sale of abortifacients is responsible for high number of self induced abortion related complications. </p...|$|E
40|$|RATIONALE: The social {{marketing}} of STD treatment {{may be a}} strategy to increase the availability of effective therapy for urethritis in male patients. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a pilot project of {{social marketing}} of urethritis treatment packages. The project, initially designed for <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> <b>sale</b> in private pharmacies, was finally restricted by national health authorities to primary healthcare settings in Yaounde and Douala, Cameroon. METHODS: Monthly sales of packages containing antibiotics, condoms, partner referral cards, and written information on STDs were monitored by the social marketing agency. Structured {{interviews were conducted with}} a sample of traceable patients who had consulted for urethritis. Structured interviews completed by focus group discussions were conducted among healthcare providers. Interview findings were further validated by a "mystery patient" survey, using surrogate patients. Lastly, 15 key informants among the decision markers involved in the project were interviewed in depth. Local independent consultants carried out the whole evaluation. RESULTS: A total of 1392 treatment packages were sold in 10 months. Patients who had purchased the package reported high compliance with the treatment, with 99 % taking the single dose of cefuroxime-axetil and 83 % completing the course of doxycycline. 76 % notified all or some partners, and 84 % of those who had sex during treatment used condoms. In contrast, only 27 % of trained healthcare providers prescribed "MSTOP". They questioned the omission of laboratory diagnosis, the selection of antibiotics, and the duration of therapy. Public health authorities were also sceptical about the choice of antibiotics and viewed the initial project as an overt encouragement of self medication. CONCLUSIONS: Although the MSTOP project was not implemented in the way it had initially been designed, it highlighted the patients' interest in the product. Public health authorities in Cameroon should have been made aware of the limitations of the formal sector's response to STD care among men before <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> <b>sale</b> of prepackaged therapy could have been considered as an alternative approach to inadequate self medication. ...|$|E

40|$|Optomet rists {{have always}} {{considered}} the fitting {{of all types}} of contact lenses to {{be an integral part of}} the scope of practice of their profession.   However, since the introduction of disposable cosmetic coloured contact lenses into the market, <b>the</b> frequency of <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> <b>sales</b> of contact lenses has significantly increased.   Patients often present with contact lens complications at the University of Kwa-Zulu Natal clinic and local practices.   It is sometimes reported that the lenses were purchased <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter,</b> from an optometry practice or another non-registered vendor.   A common observation in these instances has been that the lenses do not fit optimally and that the incidence of complications associated with tight fitting lenses was much higher amongst the African patients as opposed to those of other race groups.   A clinical observational study utilizing convenience sampling of 240 subjects was undertaken to evaluate the fitting criteria of disposable cosmetic coloured contact lenses on a South African clinic based population.   All patients requesting the lenses chose their preferred colour and were fitted with Freshlook ColorBlends, Images or Expressions Colors lenses.   Lenses were evaluated after 20 - 25 minutes and then classified into tight, ideal or loose fits according to the lower lid push-up test, lenscentration, post blink movement and version lag and upgaze lens movements.   The ages of the subjects ranged from 16 to 45 years with a mean of 24. 13 ± 5. 66 years.   Seventy (29. 2 %) were males and 170 (70. 8 %) were females. The majority (62. 9 %) of the lenses fitted on the subjects were rejected according to the fit criteria. The African subjects had the highest percentage of rejected fits (82. 8 %) whilst 75 % of the White subjects had acceptable fits.   The main reason for lens fits being rejected was that they displayed charac teristics of a tight fit (96 %) with only 4 % of the fits being rejected due to being too loose. These results highlight the need for contact lens manufacturing companies to realize that those lenses that they design and which undergo clinical trials on Caucasian eyes do not necessarily fit well on the majority of patients in this part of the world.   The reasons for this may be related to differences in corneal profiles of the different population groups with some being more suitable to particular lens designs than others. It is recommended that the public and practitioners be educated about the potential dangers of <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> <b>sales</b> of contact lenses and that pre-fitting evaluations consultations of all contact lenses are an essential part of contact lens care. </p...|$|R
40|$|Depression {{is often}} seen as a growing public health issue, and this is {{reflected}} in {{a growing number of}} interventions. This paper discusses the ethical implications of interventions conducted at the population, as opposed to the individual, level. We start by outlining the main ethical considerations of such approaches. Particularly we argue that given the stigma associated with diagnoses and labels of mental illness, including depression, allocation or adoption of such labels greatly effects the lives of sufferers. While long-term social and legal efforts may be made to reduce stigma and discrimination, the potential consequences of such labels must be recognised and greater sensitivity to this must illuminate discussions and practice of diagnosis, intervention and treatment. With this in mind, we proceed to consider several specific large-scale interventions to address depression. These include: webbased interventions; <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> <b>sales</b> of anti-depressants; school-based interventions and interventions in the young and environmental interventions. We conclude that many types of large-scale intervention are not ethically unproblematic {{and that there is a}} significant difference between treating people who seek help, and searching for people whom we think need help. Consequently, in the current climate of prevailing attitudes towards mental health generally, and depression in particular, the use of population-level interventions raises serious ethical considerations that cannot be ignored...|$|R

40|$|Background: Rampant rise in {{resistance}} to various antimicrobials among clinical isolates of Escherichia coli {{is an issue}} of serious concern, especially in developing countries. It not only causes failure in treatment but also pose a health burden over the society at large. Methods: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method on Muller Hinton agar as per Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute recommendations over 100 isolates of E. coli. Isolate resistant to at least three classes of antimicrobial agents was considered as multidrug resistant. Isolate resistant to the three classes of antimicrobials along with carbapenem was considered extensively drug resistant. Results: On performing the antimicrobial sensitivity pattern it was observed that E. coli isolates were maximally sensitive to ertapenem (56 %), followed by imipenem (44 %), meropenem (41 %), piperacillin-tazobactam (23 %), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (21 %), aztreonam (18 %) among beta-lactams group of antibiotics. 41 % E. coli isolates were multidrug resistant and 11 % were extensively drug resistant isolates.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The irrational {{overuse of}} {{antibiotics}} should be minimized as it drives {{the development of}} antibiotic resistance, but changing these practices is challenging. A better understanding is needed of practices and economic incentives for antibiotic dispensing in order to design effective interventions to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use. Here we report on both quantitative and qualitative aspects of antibiotic sales in private pharmacies in northern Vietnam. METHOD: A cross-sectional {{study was conducted in}} which all drug sales were observed and recorded for three consecutive days at thirty private pharmacies, 15 urban and 15 rural, in the Hanoi region in 2010. The proportion of antibiotics to total drug sales was assessed and the revenue was calculated for rural and urban settings. Pharmacists and drug sellers were interviewed by a semi-structured questionnaire and in-depth interviews to understand the incentive structure of antibiotic dispensing. RESULTS: In total 2953 drug sale transactions (2083 urban and 870 rural) were observed. Antibiotics contributed 24 % and 18 % to the total revenue of pharmacies in urban and rural, respectively. Most antibiotics were sold without a prescription: 88 % in urban and 91 % in rural pharmacies. The most frequent reported reason for buying antibiotics was cough in the urban setting (32 %) and fever in the rural area (22 %). Consumers commonly requested antibiotics without having a prescription: 50 % in urban and 28 % in rural area. The qualitative data revealed that drug sellers and customer's knowledge of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance were low, particularly in rural area. CONCLUSION: <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> <b>sales</b> of antibiotic without a prescription remains a major problem in Vietnam. Suggested areas of improvement are enforcement of regulations and pricing policies and educational programs to increase the knowledge of drug sellers as well as to increase community awareness to reduce demand-side pressure for drug sellers to dispense antibiotics inappropriately...|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{clinical}} {{failure and}} relapses {{have been observed}} in patients treated with antifungals. Drug resistance has become an important problem leading to significant negative social, psychological, and occupational health effects and quality of life. Early recognition and treatment is essential to reduce morbidity and possibility of transmission. The increased use, inappropriate prescribing and <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> <b>sale</b> of antifungal agents has also added {{in the development of}} resistance to these drugs. The main biochemical and molecular mechanisms that contribute to antifungal resistance include reduced uptake of the drug, an active transport out of the cell or modified drug metabolic degradation of the cell, changes in the interaction of the drug to the target site or other enzymes involved in the process by point mutations, overexpression of the target molecule, overproduction or mutation of the target enzyme, amplification and gene conversion (recombination), and increased cellular efflux and occurrence of biofilm. Although, there is considerable knowledge concerning the biochemical, genetic and clinical aspects of resistance to antifungal agents, expansion of our understanding of the mechanisms by which antifungal resistance emerges and spreads, quicker methods for the determination of resistance, targetting efflux pumps, especially ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters and heat shock protein 90, new drug delivery systems, optimizing therapy according to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics, new classes of antifungal drugs that are active against azole-resistant isolates, and use of combinations of antifungal drugs or use of adjunctive immunostimulatory therapy and other modalities of treatment will clearly be important for future treatment strategies and in preventing development of resistance...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis review {{discusses}} the known cardiovascular effects of smoking {{and the effects}} of nicotine without tobacco smoke and interprets the available data on cardiovascular risk during nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Nicotine gum and patches are now approved for <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> <b>sale</b> in the United States. Smokers with cardiovascular disease are advised to seek physician counseling before using nicotine products, but information regarding the safety of these products in such patients is not readily available to most physicians. Nicotine may contribute to cardiovascular disease, presumably by hemodynamic consequences of sympathetic neural stimulation and systemic catecholamine release. However, there are many potential cardiovascular toxins in cigarette smoke other than nicotine. The doses of nicotine obtained by regular cigarette smoking generally exceed those delivered by NRTs, and the cardiovascular effects of nicotine are, in general, more intense when delivered rapidly by cigarette smoking than the slower delivery by transdermal nicotine or nicotine gum. Because the dose–cardiovascular response relation for nicotine is flat, the effects of cigarette smoking in conjunction with NRT {{are similar to those of}} cigarette smoking alone. Cigarette smoking increases blood coagulability, a major risk factor for acute cardiovascular events, whereas transdermal nicotine does not appear to do so. Clinical trials of NRT in patients with underlying, stable coronary disease suggest that nicotine does not increase cardiovascular risk. At worst, the risks of NRT are no more than those of cigarette smoking. The risks of NRT for smokers, even for those with underlying cardiovascular disease, are small and are substantially outweighed by the potential benefits of smoking cessation.

40|$|Syndromic {{surveillance}} is {{the gathering}} of data for public health purposes before laboratory or clinically confirmed information is available. Interest in syndromic surveillance has increased {{because of concerns about}} bioterrorism. In addition to bioterrorism detection, syndromic surveillance may be suited to detecting waterborne disease outbreaks. Theoretical benefits of syndromic surveillance include potential timeliness, increased response capacity, ability to establish baseline disease burdens, and ability to delineate the geographical reach of an outbreak. This review summarises the evidence gathered from retrospective, prospective, and simulation studies to assess the efficacy of syndromic surveillance for waterborne disease detection. There is little evidence that syndromic surveillance mitigates the effects of disease outbreaks through earlier detection and response. Syndromic surveillance should not be implemented at the expense of traditional disease surveillance, and should not be relied upon as a principal outbreak detection tool. The utility of syndromic surveillance is dependent on alarm thresholds that can be evaluated in practice. Syndromic data sources such as <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> drug <b>sales</b> for detection of waterborne outbreaks should be further evaluated...|$|R
40|$|Since 2000 {{there have}} been a number of policy changes in the UK to remove {{barriers}} that limit access to medicines.

40|$|Background: Antibiotic {{resistance}} {{has become}} a worldwide problem. Recently, {{there has been a}} global increase in infections caused by microorganisms resistant to multiple antibiotics. This has led to increases in morbidity and mortality and increased the cost of health care, which threatens to become unaffordable in developing countries. Behavioural factors, particularly the misuse of antibiotics; and lack of infection control practices in communities are the most common factors which lead to increase in antibiotic resistance. In Viet Nam, self-treatment is very common. Inappropriate use of antibiotics is frequent in the communities and in the hospitals. The development of antibiotic resistance is increasing in Viet Nam. Self-medication has been associated, in particular, with the overuse and inappropriate use of antibiotic drugs, and this has caused antibiotic resistance levels in Viet Nam to reach epidemic levels. This research was carried out in Bac Ninh province in order to identify the risk factors contributing to antibiotic resistance of enteric bacteria. Objective: The objectives of this study were identifying the risk factors that contribute to antibiotic resistance of bacteria; studying the pattern of use of antibiotics in the community; and determining the antibiotic susceptibility of enteropathogenic Echerichia coli (EPEC) strains isolated from the diarrhoeal patients. Methods: A hospital based cross-sectional study was performed. Suspected cases were diarrhoeal patient with {{greater than or equal to}} three diarrhoeal movements per day, who were admitted to Bac Ninh hospital from August to December, 2004. Study’s targets were defined as positive with EPEC in stool culture. Antibiotic sensitivity testing was performed on EPEC strains isolated. Exposure was defined as a case with EPEC strain resistant to at least one kind of the antibiotics tested. Non-exposure was defined as a case with EPEC strain sensitive to all of the antibiotics tested. Interviews were performed using a standard questionnaire collecting information regarding their behaviour concerning in antibiotic consumption, hygiene and socio-economic indicators. Results: There were 227 cases positive with EPEC among the 526 diarrhoeal patients admitted to Bac Ninh hospital during period time of this study. Among them, 171 cases were exposure and 48 cases were non-exposure (we did not include 8 cases, which were patients from outside of Bac Ninh Province). 68 % of cases were children under 5 years of age. Following the conditional logistic regression model, being a patient with diarrhoea for more than 7 days (OR = 0. 21; 95 % CI: 0. 05 - 0. 93; P-value = 0. 039); having a history of using antibiotic during the preceding 90 days (OR= 5. 41; 95 % CI: 1. 39 - 21. 00; P-value = 0. 015); having a low general knowledge (OR = 0. 15; 95 % CI: 0. 04 - 0. 52; P-value = 0. 003); having used antibiotics in wrongly compared to medical instruction; and having been drinking un-boiled water were independently associated with antibiotic resistance of the EPEC strains isolated from the diarrhoeal patients. Among the 179 cases (78. 85 %) resistant to at least one kind of antibiotic, 157 cases (69 %) were resistant to two or more of the antibiotics. There was a high rate of resistance to ampicillin (69. 16 %) and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazol (67. 84 %). In this study, we also found some EPEC strains (9 strains) resistant to ciprofloxacin. Conclusion: Our study suggested that some factors such as: misuse of antibiotics; lack of knowledge about the signs of infectious disease; having a history of recently using antibiotics; drinking un-boiled water; and being exposed to unhygienic condition in living area were associated with antibiotic resistance of the disease – causing EPEC bacteria. There was a high proportion of resistance in the EPEC strains isolated from diarrhoeal patients. Antibiotic resistance {{has become a}}n important problem. Multiple drug resistance (resistance with greater than or equal to two kinds of antibiotic) exists as a serious problem in Bac Ninh Province. These findings suggest that monitoring and control of resistance to antibiotics of bacteria are very important. Antibiotic sensitivity testing in the health care centres (at least in the hospitals) should be carried out as a routine to ensure that suitable antibiotics are used for treating infectious diseases. Patient should follow <b>the</b> doctor’s prescription. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> <b>sales</b> of antibiotics should be stopped. Public communication is important to raise general knowledge of antibiotic use and encourage the population to use boiled water.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite a {{decreasing}} {{incidence of}} peptic ulcer disease, most previous studies report a stabile incidence of ulcer complications. We wanted {{to investigate the}} incidence of peptic ulcer complications in Sweden {{before and after the}} introduction of the proton pump inhibitors (PPI) in 1988 and compare these data to the sales of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). METHODS: All cases of gastric and duodenal ulcer complications diagnosed in Sweden from 1974 to 2002 were identified using the National hospital discharge register. Information on sales of ASA/NSAID was obtained from the National prescription survey. RESULTS: When comparing the time-periods before and after 1988 we found a significantly lower incidence of peptic ulcer complications during the later period for both sexes (p < 0. 001). Incidence rates varied from 1. 5 to 7. 8 / 100000 inhabitants/year regarding perforated peptic ulcers and from 5. 2 to 40. 2 regarding peptic ulcer bleeding. The number of sold daily dosages of prescribed NSAID/ASA tripled from 1975 to 2002. The number of prescribed sales to women was higher than to males. Sales of low-dose ASA also increased. The total volume of NSAID and ASA, i. e. <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> <b>sale</b> and sold on prescription, increased by 28 % during the same period. CONCLUSION: When comparing the periods before and after the introduction of the proton pump inhibitors we found a significant decrease in the incidence of peptic ulcer complications in the Swedish population after 1988 when PPI were introduced on the market. The cause of this decrease is most likely multifactorial, including smoking habits, NSAID consumption, prevalence of Helicobacter pylori and the introduction of PPI. Sales of prescribed NSAID/ASA increased, especially in middle-aged and elderly women. This fact seems to have had little effect on the incidence of peptic ulcer complications...|$|E
40|$|Abstract— Acne vulgaris is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} {{disease of the}} pilosebaceous unit. The clinical lesions are non-inflammatory open and closed comedones and or papules, pustules and nodules of varying degree of inflammation and depth. A lot of steroid, cosmetic and Ayurvedic products containing unlabeled depigmenting agent and steroids are available readily <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> <b>sale.</b> The side effects of these products are not documented {{and can lead to}} adverse effects of continuous usage. This study was aimed to find out various offending depigmenting agents (topical unlabeled steroid containing cosmetics) for treatment of Acne and its side effects with type of offering persons. This study was conducted on 1110 OPD patient of which 1000 (90. 10 %) patients are using steroid and unlabeled steroid containing cosmetics and only 110 (9. 90 %) patient not using any topical application. Mostly affected common age group was 11 - 20 years (58 %) with slight female preponderance (M:F 0. 96). Urban patients were more affected than rural (74 % v/s 26 %). Unmarrieds (76 %) were more affected than married (24 %). Friends appeared as chief culprit or suggestions given to them (39 %) followed by family member(13. 5 %), self-application (12 %) influenced by advertisements, chemist(11. 5 %), general practitioner (9. 5 %), neighbor (4. 5 %), compounder(1. 5 %), parlor(2 %) and only 2 % by dermatologist. Betamethasone (32. 5 %) was major offending agent followed by Clobetasol (25 %), unlabeled steroid containing cosmetics (12. 5 %), Aloe Vera gel (7. 5 %). Monomorphic acne was main side effect diagnosed in 79 % of patients followed by pustular acne (8 %), nodular acne (4 %), rosacea (4 %), nodulocystic acne (3 %) and perioral dermatitis (2 %). Study concluded that misuse of topical steroids and unlabeled steroid containing cosmetics causing various side effects. It is unethical to sale and use without the prescription of an authorised person. So these depigmenting agents should be banned to sell without authorization and without the prescription of an authorised person...|$|E
40|$|There are {{two major}} ways of selling {{impressions}} in display advertising. They are either sold in spot through auction mechanisms or in advance via guaranteed contracts. The former has achieved a significant automation via real-time bidding (RTB); however, the latter is still mainly done <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> through direct <b>sales.</b> This paper proposes a mathematical model that allocates and prices the future impressions between real-time auctions and guaranteed contracts. Under conventional economic assumptions, our model shows that the two ways can be seamless combined programmatically and the publisher's revenue can be maximized via price discrimination and optimal allocation. We consider advertisers are risk-averse, {{and they would be}} willing to purchase guaranteed impressions if the total costs are less than their private values. We also consider that an advertiser's purchase behavior can be affected by both the guaranteed price and the time interval between the purchase time and the impression delivery date. Our solution suggests an optimal percentage of future impressions to sell in advance and provides an explicit formula to calculate at what prices to sell. We find that the optimal guaranteed prices are dynamic and are non-decreasing over time. We evaluate our method with RTB datasets and find that the model adopts different strategies in allocation and pricing according to the level of competition. From the experiments we find that, in a less competitive market, lower prices of the guaranteed contracts will encourage the purchase in advance and the revenue gain is mainly contributed by the increased competition in future RTB. In a highly competitive market, advertisers are more willing to purchase the guaranteed contracts and thus higher prices are expected. The revenue gain is largely contributed by the guaranteed selling.

40|$|Cost and {{convenience}} {{seem to be}} major factors in determining whether, given the choice, patients purchase a medicine <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> or obtain it on prescription.
