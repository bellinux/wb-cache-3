40|$|The {{threat of}} climate change may be the {{greatest}} social and environmental challenge of our time. Yet if the increase in warming is to be stabilised, then a reduction in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) is needed. Sink technologies such as <b>ocean</b> <b>fertilisation</b> claim to do this by stimulating phytoplankton to grow into massive blooms, thereby drawing down large amounts of CO 2 from the atmosphere into the deep ocean. But the science is unproven and concerns have been raised, not only about its feasibility, but also the environmental and legal implications. This thesis examines the process of <b>ocean</b> <b>fertilisation</b> and the capacity and effectiveness of current international and domestic legal regimes to regulate it. The science and feasibility of <b>ocean</b> <b>fertilisation,</b> primarily as a carbon mitigation measure, but also for carbon trading and seafood production, were considered. Three case studies were used as models to test how each legal instrument {{could be applied to}} the selected criteria to measure either capacity or effectiveness. Criteria were drawn from two critical areas of concern — the protection of the environment and enforcement. The research established that current Australian domestic law would most likely have adequate checks and balances to regulate <b>ocean</b> <b>fertilisation</b> activities within Australia’s exclusive economic zone and territorial waters, with the exception of some external territories where compliance and enforcement may be problematic. The international law was found to be less effective; the main concern was the use of flags of convenience to bypass regulation on the high seas. Areas of conflict were found, particularly between <b>ocean</b> <b>fertilisation</b> for scientific research and commercial purposes. While there are no existing international legal instruments for <b>ocean</b> <b>fertilisation</b> generally, there is a framework for the assessment of <b>ocean</b> <b>fertilisation</b> for scientific research, leaving the future of commercial <b>ocean</b> <b>fertilisation</b> operations still undetermined. A model {{for the development of a}} new legal instrument to regulate <b>ocean</b> <b>fertilisation</b> activities, incorporating both research and commercial applications, was suggested...|$|E
40|$|The oceans {{sequester}} carbon {{from the}} atmosphere {{partly as a result}} of biological productivity. Over much of the ocean surface this productivity is limited by essential nutrients and we discuss whether it is likely that sequestration can be enhanced by supplying limiting nutrients. Various methods of supply have been suggested and we discuss the efficacy of each and the potential side effects that may develop as a result. Our conclusion is that these methods have the potential to enhance sequestration but that the current level of knowledge from the observations and modelling carried out to date does not provide a sound foundation on which to make clear predictions or recommendations. For <b>ocean</b> <b>fertilisation</b> to become a viable option to sequester CO 2 we need more extensive and targeted field work and better mathematical models of ocean biogeochemical processes. Models are needed both to interpret field observations and to make reliable predictions about the side effects of large scale fertilisation. They would also be an essential tool with which to verify that sequestration has effectively taken place. There is considerable urgency to address climate change mitigation and this demands that new field work plans are developed rapidly. In contrast to previous experiments, these must focus on the specific objective which is to assess the possibilities of CO 2 sequestration through fertilisation.

40|$|Delivery of {{nutrients}} {{to the ocean}} by mineral aerosol deposition involves complex biogeochemical interactions that include atmospheric processing, dissolution and biotic uptake of available nutrients in the surface waters. Research into the fertilization potential of aeolian dust is currently constrained {{by a lack of}} understanding of the nutrient composition and bioavailability in dust source areas. Further, research into hot-spots of dust emission has largely focused on paleo-lacustrine sources and pans, to the detriment of other potential sources such as ephemeral river valleys in desert regions. Here, we investigate the sediment characteristics and nutrient content of windblown and surface sediments of a largely overlooked southern African dust source, Namibia’s ephemeral river valleys. We deployed monitoring equipment in three river valleys to capture deflated sediments and monitor airborne dust concentration and meteorological conditions throughout an annual dust season. Our results show that windblown dust within the river valleys is easily transportable offshore from Namibia over the Benguela Upwelling System, an intensely productive region of the South Atlantic Ocean. We demonstrate that the windblown dust contains iron, phosphorus and nitrogen nutrients, each of which may positively impact primary production rates when deposited in the complex upwelling system. The river valley dust has a significantly higher content {{of nutrients}} than either of southern Africa’s major dry lake bed dust sources Etosha and Makgadikgadi Pans. This aeolian work builds on previous source sediment findings proposing the ephemeral river valleys of Namibia as regionally important sources of dust with enhanced <b>ocean</b> <b>fertilisation</b> potential...|$|E
40|$|Climate change {{mitigation}} is one {{the greatest}} challenges facing humankind. Recent attempts at reducing carbon emissions have stalled. Various proposals have been made that aim to reduce the levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide through geoengineering. One such technique is <b>ocean</b> iron <b>fertilisation.</b> This paper examines {{the current state of}} international law surrounding geoengineering practices involving the sea, with a predominant focus on <b>ocean</b> iron <b>fertilisation,</b> to evaluate the law’s appropriateness and effectiveness at regulating this conduct. This paper concludes that the current law lacks certainty and clarity. It proposes that the law would be more effective through a legally binding amendment to the London Convention and Protocol, stronger domestic legislation and the removal of economic incentives...|$|R
40|$|There is overall {{agreement}} that volcanic sulphate aerosols {{in the stratosphere}} can reduce solar radiation reaching the earth’s surface for years, thereby reducing surface temperatures, affecting global circulation patterns and generally the global climate system. However, {{the response of the}} climate system after large volcanic eruptions is not fully understood and global climate models have difficulties to reproduce the observed variability of the earth system after large volcanic eruptions until now. For geological timescales, it has been suggested that, in addition to the stratospheric climate forcing by volcanic sulphate aerosols, volcanic ash affects climate by modifying the global carbon cycle through iron fertilising the surface ocean and stimulating phytoplankton growth. This process has recently also been observed after the eruption of the volcano Kasatochi on the Aleutian Islands in summer 2008. To trigger future research on the effect of volcanic ash on the climate system via <b>ocean</b> iron <b>fertilisation,</b> this review paper describes the formation processes and atmospheric life cycles of volcanic sulphate and volcanic ash, contrasts their impact on climate, and emphasises current limitations in our understanding...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explores the}} changes in the surface water {{fugacity}} of carbon dioxide (fCO 2) and biological carbon uptake in two Southern <b>Ocean</b> iron <b>fertilisation</b> experiments with different hydrographic regimes. The Southern Ocean Iron Release Experiment (SOIREE) experiment was carried out south of the Antarctic Polar Front (APF) at 61 °S, 141 °E in February 1999 in a stable hydrographic setting. The EisenEx experiment was conducted in a cyclonic eddy north of the APF at 48 °S, 21 °E in November 2000 and was characterised by a rapid succession of low to storm-force wind speeds and dynamic hydrographic conditions. The iron additions promoted algal blooms in both studies. They alleviated algal iron limitation during the 13 -day SOIREE experiment and probably during the first 12 days of EisenEx. The fCO 2 in surface water decreased at a constant rate of 3. 8 µatm day- 1 from 4 to 5 days onwards in SOIREE. The fCO 2 reduction was 35 µatm after 13 days. The evolution of surface water fCO 2 in the iron-enriched waters (or ‘patch’) displayed a saw tooth pattern in EisenEx, in response to algal carbon uptake in calm conditions and deep mixing and horizontal dispersion during storms. The maximum fCO 2 reduction was 18 – 20 µatm after 12 and 21 days with lower values in between. The iron-enriched waters in EisenEx absorbed four times more atmospheric CO 2 than in SOIREE between 5 and 12 days, as a result of stronger winds. The total biological uptake of inorganic carbon across the patch was 1389 ton C (± 10 %) in SOIREE and 1433 ton C (± 27 %) in EisenEx after 12 days (1 ton = 10 ^ 6 g). This similarity probably reflects the comparable size of the iron additions, as well as algal growth at a similar near-maximum growth rate in these regions. The findings imply that the different mixing regimes had less effect on the overall biological carbon uptake across the iron-enriched waters than suggested by the evolution of fCO 2 in surface water. ...|$|R
40|$|Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) {{approaches}} are {{efforts to reduce}} the atmospheric CO 2 concentration. Here we use a marine carbon cycle model to investigate the effects of one CDR technique: the open ocean dissolution of the iron-containing mineral olivine. We analyse the maximum CDR potential of an annual dissolution of 3 Pg olivine during the 21 st century {{and focus on the}} role of the micro-nutrient iron for the biological carbon pump. Distributing the products of olivine dissolution (bicarbonate, silicic acid, iron) uniformly in the global surface ocean has a maximum CDR potential of 0. 57 gC/g-olivine mainly due to the alkalinisation of the ocean, with a significant contribution from the fertilisation of phytoplankton with silicic acid and iron. The part of the CDR caused by <b>ocean</b> <b>fertilisation</b> is not permanent, while the CO 2 sequestered by alkalinisation would be stored in the ocean as long as alkalinity is not removed from the system. For high CO 2 emission scenarios the CDR potential due to the alkalinity input becomes more efficient over time with increasing ocean acidification. The alkalinity-induced CDR potential scales linearly with the amount of olivine, while the iron-induced CDR saturates at 113 PgC per century (on average ~ 1. 1 PgC yr− 1) for an iron input rate of 2. 3 Tg Fe yr− 1 (1 % of the iron contained in 3 Pg olivine). The additional iron-related CO 2 uptake occurs in the Southern Ocean and in the iron-limited regions of the Pacific. Effects of this approach on surface ocean pH are small (< 0. 01) ...|$|E
40|$|Artificial {{fertilisation}} of {{the ocean}} has been proposed as a possible geoengineering method for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The associated increase in marine primary productivity may {{lead to an increase}} in emissions of dimethyl sulphide (DMS), the primary source of sulphate aerosol over remote ocean regions, potentially causing direct and cloud-related indirect aerosol effects on climate. This pathway from <b>ocean</b> <b>fertilisation</b> to aerosol induced cooling of the climate may provide a basis for solar radiation management (SRM) geoengineering. In this study, we investigate the transient climate impacts of two emissions scenarios: an RCP 4. 5 (Representative Concentration Pathway 4. 5) control; and an idealised scenario, based on RCP 4. 5, in which DMS emissions are substantially enhanced over ocean areas. We use mini-ensembles of a coupled atmosphere-ocean configuration of CESM 1 (CAM 5) (Community Earth System Model version 1, with the Community Atmosphere Model version 5). We find that the cooling effect associated with enhanced DMS emissions beneficially offsets greenhouse gas induced warming across most of the world. However, the rainfall response may adversely affect water resources, potentially impacting human livelihoods. These results demonstrate that changes in marine phytoplankton activity may lead to a mixture of positive and negative impacts on the climate. Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology.

40|$|Research {{concerning}} the global distribution of aeolian dust sources has principally focussed on salt/clay pan and desiccated lacustrine emission areas. In southern Africa such sources {{are identified as}} Etosha Pan in northern Namibia and Makgadikgadi Pans in northern Botswana. Dust emitting from ephemeral river valleys, however, has been largely overlooked. Rivers are known nutrient transport pathways and the flooding regimes of ephemeral river valleys frequently replenish stores of fine sediment which, on drying, can become susceptible to aeolian erosion. Such airborne sediment may be nutrient rich and thus be significant for the fertilisation of marine waters once deposited. This study investigates the dust source sediments from three ephemeral river valleys in Namibia {{in terms of their}} particle size distribution and their concentrations of bioavailable N, P and Fe. We compare the nutrient content of these sediments from the ephemeral river valleys to those collected from Etosha and Makgadikgadi Pans and consider their relative ocean fertilising potential. Our results show that the ephemeral river valleys contain fine grained sediment similar in physical character to Etosha and Makgadikgadi Pans yet they have up to 43 times greater concentrations of bioavailable iron and enriched N and P macronutrients that are each important for <b>ocean</b> <b>fertilisation.</b> The known dust-emitting river valleys of Namibia may therefore be contributing a greater fertilisation role in the adjacent marine system than previously considered, and not-yet investigated. Given this finding a re-assessment of the potential role of ephemeral river valleys in providing nutrient-rich sediment into the aeolian and marine systems in other dryland areas is necessary...|$|E
40|$|During the EisenEx experiment, {{conducted}} in HNLC (High Nutrients Low Chlorophyll) {{waters of the}} Southern Ocean, the centre of an eddy was fertilized with iron sulphate and followed {{over a period of}} 3 weeks in November 2000. The aim of this experiment was to assess the impact on the pelagic community and the processes within the food web driven by changes in plankton distribution and abundance. The large microzooplankton (in particular acantharians and tintinnid) and small mesozooplankton (copepodids and nauplii) community was surveyed inside and outside the iron enriched patch. Species abundance and taxonomic composition were quantified by microscopic techniques in concentrated water samples taken from seven discrete depth between 10 and 150 mBy the end of the experiment phytoplankton biomass had increased fourfold and the microzooplankton groups showed different trends in abundance. The abundance of acantharians increased by a factor of ~ 2. 7 in the fertilized patch, but only slightly outside the patch. This is of major interest, because acantharians are suggested to be indirectly responsible for the formation of barite found in sediments and a paleo-indicator of high productivity regimes. The total abundance of the tintinnid ciliates (i. e. full and empty loricae) doubled inside the iron enriched patch compared to no change outside the patch. Moreover the numbers of empty loricae, an indicator of grazing pressure on tintinnids, increased about 2. 2 -fold inside with no change outside. This indicates that tintinnids increased growth rates with higher food availability but grazing pressure on them also intensified so that no net growth was recorded {{in the course of the}} experiment. With regard to small mesozooplankton, copepodid numbers increased significantly (by a factor of ~ 3. 6) inside the patch with a ~ 2. 1 -fold increase in the adjacent water mass. Nauplii numbers slightly increased in patch (by a factor of 1. 7) in contrast to no changes out patch. These results indicate that at least some of the large micro- and small mesozooplankton responded to the rapidly increasing food supply due to iron addition in this Southern Ocean HNLC region. In unfertilized waters, the slight increase in numbers of small grazers matched the seasonal increase in diatom biomass.

40|$|Determining the {{distribution}} and abundance of life is challenging, especially in the deep sea where high pressure and other logistical challenges limit data availability to {{a tiny fraction of}} what is available for other systems. Most of Earth’s surface is nonetheless covered by water > 2000 m deep. Life in these abyssal regions influences the burial of carbon and nutrient cycling. Long-term research has now shown that even larger animals in the deep sea can vary in density by orders of magnitude, with concurrent changes in average body size, over periods as short as months. These variations are widely believed to be linked to climate-driven variation in the food supply to the deep sea. Similarly, biogeography studies have found that over distances approaching 100 km or more, the abundance of deep-sea life is related to surface productivity in the waters above. Thus the deep sea could be readily impacted by processes that alter surface ocean conditions like climate change, fishery activity, or <b>ocean</b> iron <b>fertilisation.</b> While there has been an increase in the understanding of how climate and surface processes affect deep-sea communities, the ability to understand these links further is thought to be limited by sampling error from undetected habitat heterogeneity (i. e. irregular or uneven habitat distributions). Features like hills, valleys, depressions, small rock outcrops, and biogenic mounds add to habitat complexity, but links between such features and the animals that live among them are very poorly resolved in abyssal plain habitats using current methods. We proposed a new approach using the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) Autosub 6000 to survey ecologically the Porcupine Abyssal Plain (PAP) Sustained Observatory to address a key question: Are spatial patterns in abyssal habitat features (like bathymetry, seafloor cover of phytodetrius [i. e. food availability], suspended solid concentration) related to spatial patterns in photographed life (density, dispersion, or biodiversity) at spatial scales from < 1 m^ 2 to about 100 km^ 2 ? Objectives 1. 	We created high-resolution ecological maps at scales of < 1 m^ 2 to 100 km^ 2. 2. 	We will then test tractable hypotheses focusing on if any observed faunal distributions are linked with the spatial patterns of other fauna, habitat, food availability, or environmental conditions. 3. 	We will use the results to improve estimates of deep-sea biodiversity and ecosystem function of megafauna and relate the findings to factors such as food availability. 4. 	We will enhance UK capability in evaluating abyssal ecology and facilitate future time-series ecological research surveys.

40|$|The {{biological}} carbon pump (BCP) is {{a significant}} part of the global carbon cycle, exporting ? 10 Gt of particulate organic carbon (POC) out of the euphotic zone each year. However, most of the exported POC is remineralized biologically within the upper few hundred metres of the mesopelagic, above the permanent thermocline. Gaining more understanding of the factors controlling the BCP is hence important for understanding and predicting the global carbon cycle better. This thesis investigates the BCP in the Iceland Basin, and during an artificial <b>ocean</b> iron <b>fertilisation</b> experiment in the South Atlantic. In the Iceland Basin, export during a spring diatom bloom was tracked using Lagrangian sediment traps and thorium- 234 disequilibria. A large pulse of diatom detritus was exported suddenly at the end of the bloom, probably upon impending Si-limitation. The particles were rich in transparent exopolymer particles (TEP, sticky polysaccharides secreted by phytoplankton), and a comparatively large proportion (20 – 40 %) of the exported POC sank past 750 m. This shows that diatom blooms can produce rapid pulses of particle sedimentation that are transferred efficiently through the mesopelagic, and suggests that aggregation and sinking are mediated by TEP. In contrast, alleviating iron limitation in low silicic acid waters of the South Atlantic with very high copepod grazing pressure only caused a modest phytoplankton response and no enhancement of downward particle flux. This was probably primarily due to grazing control and detritus-feeding by copepods, since diatom growth rates were apparently not strongly Si-limited. This suggests that future Fe-fertilisation experiments must investigate the role of zooplankton thoroughly to distinguish beween bottom-up control of export by nutrient concentrations and top-down control by zooplankton. Export measurements based on thorium- 234 disequilibria compared well with net community production measured by O 2 :Ar ratios over the 39 d experiment, suggesting that these two methods can be meaningfully compared over ?month-long cruises. Further work was conducted with a mesoscale array of four time-series sediment traps deployed for eight moths in the Iceland Basin to study particle flux at 2000 m. Large, fast-sinking acantharian cysts contributed up to 48 % of POC flux during a specific flux event in early spring, demonstrating that the celestite shells of these protists do not necessarily dissolve in the upper mesopelagic as generally believed. The hypothesis is advanced that deep sinking of acantharian reproductive cysts during spring in this region enables juveniles to feed off seasonally sedimenting phytodetritus in the deep-sea. Finally, the full time-series of particle flux in the four deep traps was analysed. Fluxes peaked in late spring and again in mid-summer. Over the eight months, cumulative mass flux varied by 30 % between traps without corresponding variation in the cumulative flux of thorium- 230, implying genuine mesoscale variability in bathypelagic particle flux. Moreover, during any one of the two-week collection intervals total mass flux of particles varied 2 – 16 -fold between traps, although it is unclear how much of this short-term variability was due to differences in collection efficiency between traps. Overall, the traps probably under-collected thorium- 230 in absolute terms by at least 50 %, but this estimate is very uncertain...|$|R
40|$|Research into global hot-spots of dust {{emission}} {{has focused on}} exposed fine-grained sediments in palaeo- or ephemeral dryland lake basins including Etosha (Namibia) and Makgadikgadi (Botswana) in southern Africa. Namibia's western ephemeral river valleys are also known to produce dust but have remained largely overlooked as a regionally-significant source. Nutrient enrichment of valley sediments and proximity to the South Atlantic suggests aeolian dust could {{play an important role}} in <b>ocean</b> <b>fertilisation.</b> The fertility of valley dust is dependent on fluvial sediments originating in the upper catchments on the Southern African Central Plateau. In this study we investigate climate, geology, vegetation and land use variability and how these may influence the nitrogen, phosphorus and iron availability in the catchments. We intensely sampled the Huab, Kuiseb and Tsauchab river systems to map the spatial distribution of nutrients from upper catchments to river termini. Samples were analysed for the bioavailable fractions of iron, nitrogen and phosphorus as well as total nitrogen and phosphorus. Results show that the lower valley reaches are sources of aeolian dust enriched in nutrients. Nitrogen levels correlate with precipitation and vegetation levels and phosphorus levels with geology. However, differences in upper catchment sediment nutrient levels were not representative of downstream nutrient differences between valleys. Rather, it is the hydrological and geomorphological processes of the ephemeral river systems that are key for producing the enriched sediments in the lower reaches. We demonstrate that the ephemeral river valleys of western Namibia are an extensive and enriched source of mineral dust that could play a critical role in marine productivity of the southern Atlantic...|$|E
40|$|Climate {{geoengineering}} proposals seek {{to rectify}} the Earth's current and potential future radiative imbalance, either by reducing the absorption of incoming solar (shortwave) radiation, or by removing CO 2 from the atmosphere and transferring it to long-lived reservoirs, thus increasing outgoing longwave radiation. A fundamental criterion for evaluating geoengineering options is their climate cooling effectiveness, which we quantify here in terms of radiative forcing potential. We use a simple analytical approach, based on energy balance considerations and pulse response functions for the decay of CO 2 perturbations. This aids transparency compared to calculations with complex numerical models, but {{is not intended to}} be definitive. It allows us to compare the relative effectiveness of a range of proposals. We consider geoengineering options as additional to large reductions in CO 2 emissions. By 2050, some land carbon cycle geoengineering options could be of comparable magnitude to mitigation "wedges", but only stratospheric aerosol injections, albedo enhancement of marine stratocumulus clouds, or sunshades in space have the potential to cool the climate back toward its pre-industrial state. Strong mitigation, combined with global-scale air capture and storage, afforestation, and bio-char production, i. e. enhanced CO 2 sinks, might be able to bring CO 2 back to its pre-industrial level by 2100, thus removing the need for other geoengineering. Alternatively, strong mitigation stabilising CO 2 at 500 ppm, combined with geoengineered increases in the albedo of marine stratiform clouds, grasslands, croplands and human settlements might achieve a patchy cancellation of radiative forcing. <b>Ocean</b> <b>fertilisation</b> options are only worthwhile if sustained on a millennial timescale and phosphorus addition may have greater long-term potential than iron or nitrogen fertilisation. Enhancing ocean upwelling or downwelling have trivial effects on any meaningful timescale. Our approach provides a common framework for the evaluation of climate geoengineering proposals, and our results should help inform the prioritisation of further research into them...|$|E
40|$|Based on the {{increase}} of 16 S rRNA gene sequences in databases {{it is possible to}} design improved oligonucleotide primers for this gene. Primers were designed in silico to specifically amplify fragments of the gene from the Alpha, Beta and Gamma subgroups of the Proteobacteria, as well as from Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria and Planctomycetes and tested in silico and in vitro. The aim was to investigate bacterioplankton diversity and reveal greater fingerprint diversity within these groups than is possible using primers specific for the entire domain Bacteria, and also to reduce clone library redundancy. It was then aimed to investigate the potential impacts of increased pCO 2 and <b>ocean</b> <b>fertilisation</b> with iron (Fe) and phosphorus (P), on bacterioplankton diversity. Group-specific clone libraries representing contrasting marine regions were analysed, and the usefulness and specificity of the primers validated. The clone libraries showed members of the oligotrophic marine group (OMG) to be present in an in situ coastal mesocosm supplemented with nutrients. The newly-developed group-specific primers were used in combination with an improved method of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) to profile in detail bacterial communities in mesocosms, which were maintained at 750 ppm of pCO 2, the level projected for the global surface ocean in the year 3000, and 380 ppm of CO 2, the present level. Increased pCO 2 correlated with a decrease in abundance of some members of the Gammaproteobacteria. Otherwise there was little impact on diversity due to raised pCO 2. The same DGGE protocol was applied to samples from an ocean Fe and P fertilisation experiment. Diversity change due to Fe was not evident. However in seawater amended with P there was an explosive growth of some cells with 16 S rRNA genes {{similar to those of the}} SAR 86 clade, and others with similarity to Gammaproteobacteria with large genomes such as Oceanospirillum sp. and Psychromonas sp.
