40|$|A novel short-step {{methodology}} for the synthesis in good yields of functionalized coumarins {{has been developed}} starting from an activated precursor, the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of <b>O-acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid.</b> The procedure {{is based on a}} tandem C-acylation-cyclization process under mild reaction conditions. The structure of 3 -methoxycarbonyl- 4 -hydroxy coumarin has been established by X-ray diffraction analysis and its geometry was compared with optimized parameters by means of DFT calculations. © 2010 by the authors...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} of phenol (PHE), salicylic acid (SA) and <b>o-acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> (ASA) with bilayers of 1, 2 -dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (DPPC) was investigated by infrared spectrometry. The {{temperature of the}} main gel to liquid crystal phase transition of DPPC is markedly depressed {{in the presence of}} the three guest molecules. The temperature depression depends on the nature and concentration of the additives. The temperature of the pretransition is also affected by these guest molecules and the depression in temperature is even more pronounced than that of the main transition temperature. Possible modes of {{interaction of}} these guest molecules with the lipid bilayers are discussed. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT &# 946;-Glucuronidase inhibitors are {{suggested}} as potential hepatoprotective agents. Swertia chirayita (Roxb.) Buch. -Ham. ex C. B. Clarke, Gentianaceae, {{is known for}} its hepatoprotective and anti-hepatotoxic activity in Ayurvedic system of medicine for ages. This plant is substituted by other species like S. decussata Nimmo ex C. B. Clarke and S. bimaculata (Siebold & Zucc.) Hook. f. & Thomson ex C. B. Clarke. The aim {{of the study was to}} compare metabolite profile and &# 946;-glucuronidase inhibitory activity of these three important species of Swertia and to identify the active constituents. S. chirayita (IC 50 210. 97 µg/ml) and S. decussata (IC 50 269. 7 µg/ml) showed &# 946;-glucuronidase inhibitory activity significantly higher than that of silymarin, the known inhibitor of the enzyme. The activity of S. bimaculata was low. The metabolites present in the three species were analyzed by HPLC and GC-MS based metabolomics approach. Five amino acids, twenty one organic acids, one inorganic acid, eight fatty acids, twenty one phenols including xanthones, eight sugars, seven sugar alcohols, five terpenoids and amarogentin were identified. Activities of the xanthones mangiferin (IC 50 16. 06 µg/ml), swerchirin (IC 50 162. 84 µg/ml), decussatin (IC 50 195. 11 µg/ml), 1 -hydroxy- 3, 5, 8 -trimethoxy xanthone (IC 50 245. 97 µg/ml), bellidifolin (IC 50 390. 26 µg/ml) were significantly higher than that of silymarin (IC 50 794. 62 µg/ml). Quinic acid (IC 50 2. 91 mg/ml), <b>O-acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> (IC 50 48. 4 mg/ml), citric acid (IC 50 1. 77 mg/ml), D-malic acid (IC 50 14. 82 mg/ml) and succinic acid (IC 50 38. 86 mg/ml) also inhibited the enzyme &# 946;-glucuronidase. The findings suggest that constituents, in addition to the xanthones, probably also contribute to the bioactivity of different Swertia species by synergistic effect. Further in vivo study is required to support the claim...|$|E
40|$|We report {{solid-state}} NMR {{characterization of}} the 17 O quadrupole coupling (QC) and chemical shift (CS) tensors in five site-specifically 17 O-labeled samples of salicylic acid and <b>o-acetylsalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> (Aspirin). High-quality 17 O NMR spectra were obtained for these important pharmaceutical compounds under both static and magic angle spinning (MAS) conditions at two magnetic fields, 14. 0 and 21. 1 T. A total of 14 17 O QC and CS tensors were experimentally determined for the seven oxygen sites in salicylic acid and Aspirin. Although both salicylic acid and Aspirin form hydrogen bonded cyclic dimers in the solid state, {{we found that the}} potential curves for the concerted double proton transfer in these two compounds are significantly different. In particular, while the double-well potential curve in Aspirin is nearly symmetrical, it is highly asymmetrical in salicylic acid. This difference results in quite different temperature dependencies in 17 O MAS spectra of the two compounds. A careful analysis of variabletemperature 17 O MAS NMR spectra of Aspirin allowed us to obtain the energy asymmetry (3 ̆ 94 E) of the double-well potential, 3 ̆ 94 E = 3. 0 1 0. 5 kJ/mol. We were also able to determine a lower limit of 3 ̆ 94 E for salicylic acid, 3 ̆ 94 E > 10 kJ/mol. These asymmetrical features in potential energy curves were confirmed by plane-wave DFT computations, which yielded 3 ̆ 94 E = 3. 7 and 17. 8 kJ/mol for Aspirin and salicylic acid, respectively. To complement the solid-state 17 O NMR data, we also obtained solid-state 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra for salicylic acid and Aspirin. Using experimental NMR parameters obtained for all magnetic nuclei present in salicylic acid and Aspirin, we found that plane-wave DFT computations can produce highly accurate NMR parameters in welldefined crystalline organic compounds.
