25|$|From July 26 to August 16 {{he was in}} Dublin. He often {{met with}} {{individuals}} and small groups or made short trips to visit nearby Baha'is and a camp for youth. He also carried on with corresponding through letter across the United States and to Europe. One evening he announced the betrothal of Louis G. Gregory and Louisa Mathew and astonished the crowd. Elders with ear trumpets listened. Once he took his Persian entourage aside and spoke comparing feasts of kings that were brilliant but had no enthusiasm while there they ate modestly and in hard circumstances <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> but everywhere there was real enthusiasm of the heart. On August 11 he was noted speaking to a local Unitarian church with answers to questions of such length and detail that it was claimed he must have memorized the answers beforehand. He compared his yearning to see the audience to the Apostles that traveled far to see people. From there he left for Green Acre August 16.|$|E
500|$|It {{appeared}} that the Bobby Bowden era of Mountaineer football could not have begun more smoothly early in the 1970 season, <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed.</b> The Mountaineers were 4–1 to start the season and led arch rival Pitt 35–8 at halftime in week six. What transpired {{was one of the}} most infamous collapses in Backyard Brawl and West Virginia football history. [...] The Mountaineers surrendered 28 unanswered points, losing to the Panthers 36–35 and leading Bowden to remark that he had [...] "embarrassed the whole state of West Virginia" [...] in the process. [...] Despite the disappointment of the Pitt defeat, West Virginia went on to finish the 1970 season with a 8–3 record.Fullback Jim Braxton and linebacker Dale Farley earned All-American honors.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a review}} of his last work, Peter Green {{expressed}} admiration for West's 'marvellous polyglot and off-beat omnicompetence [...] [...]his mischievous wit, his loving resuscitation of so many great nineteenth-century scholars, the erudition which, however formidable and obsessional, always concealed (<b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> to me) a vein of slily ironic amusement.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Simonides {{composed}} verses {{almost entirely}} for public performances and inscriptions, unlike previous lyric poets such as Sappho and Alcaeus, who composed more intimate verses to entertain friends—"With Simonides {{the age of}} individualism in lyric poetry has passed." [...] <b>Or</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> to modern scholars until the recent discovery of papyrus P.Oxy.3965 in which Simonides is glimpsed in a sympotic context, speaking for example as an old man rejuvenated {{in the company of}} his homo-erotic lover, couched on a bed of flowers. Very little of his poetry survives today but enough is recorded on papyrus fragments and in quotes by ancient commentators for many conclusions to be drawn at least tentatively (nobody knows if and when the sands of Egypt will reveal further discoveries).|$|E
2500|$|Egon Kisch's {{legal team}} was headed by Christian Jollie Smith, who secured a writ {{of habeas corpus}} for Kisch and briefed Albert Piddington and Maurice Blackburn, who took his case to the full bench of the High Court, which on 19 December 1934 ruled that he be free to visit Australia. Kisch's legal team were able to {{demonstrate}} that Constable Mackay, who had administered the test, although born in Scotland, was not actually {{able to understand the}} Lord's Prayer in Scottish Gaelic himself. Crucially, the Court ruled that the dictation test had been invalid in any case, in that Scottish Gaelic was not [...] "a European language" [...] within the meaning of the Immigration Restriction Act. Kisch was now free to visit and speak in Australia. <b>Or</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed.</b>|$|E

40|$|Keynesian {{economics}} is back. As John Maynard Keynes stressed, total spending matters-and not {{who does it}} or for what purpose.
