In this paper, we report how {{we were able to}} intuitively use basic electronic components to implement an efficient automatic change <b>over</b> <b>switch.</b> In the event of a power failure from the mains supply, this automatic changeover is designed and constructed to switch on a standby generator and transfer the installation load to it (the generator) and vice versa when power is restored. The switching time was calculated and tested to be about 0. 88 ms which is sufficient to prevent any noticeable disruption in the power supply to the installation load, whether home or industrial...|$|E

40|$|This event-related brain {{potential}} (ERP) study {{aimed at}} bridging two hitherto widely separated domains of cognitive neuroscience. Specifically, we combined {{the analysis of}} cognitive control in a cued task-switching paradigm with the fundamental question of how uncertainty is encoded in the brain. Two functional models of P 3 amplitude variation in cued task-switching paradigms were put to an empirical test: (1) According to the P 3 b surprise hypothesis, parietal P 3 b waveforms are related to surprise <b>over</b> <b>switch</b> cues. (2) According to the P 3 a entropy hypothesis, frontal P 3 a waveforms are associated with entropy <b>over</b> <b>switch</b> outcomes. In order to examine these hypotheses, we measured the EEG while sixteen healthy young participants performed cued task-switching paradigms closely modeled to the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. We applied a factorial design, with number of tasks (two vs. three viable tasks), cue explicitness (task cuing vs. transition cuing), and cue contingency (prospectively-signaled cuing vs. feedback-based cuing) as independent variables. The ERP results replicated the commonly reported P 3 b effect associated with task switches, and further showed that P 3 a amplitudes {{were related to the}} entropy of switch outcomes, thereby supporting both hypotheses. Based on these ERP data, we suggest that surprise over task switches, and entropy <b>over</b> <b>switch</b> outcomes, constitute dissociable functional correlates of P 3 b and P 3 a ERP components in task-switching paradigms, respectively. Finally, a theoretical integration of the findings is proposed within the framework of Sokolov’s (1966) entropy model of the orienting response...|$|E

40|$|Alternative {{dispatch}} {{techniques for}} the Tcl VM Interpreter We compare {{the performance of}} various virtual machine dispatch strategies in Tcl, including traditional highlyportable techniques, and newer techniques which sacrifice some portability for performance. Tcl’s high-level opcodes have large implementation bodies and contain C function calls. Compared to other VMs, the opcodes require many cycles to execute. Dispatch overhead is relatively low, because large bodies consume much more execution time than dispatch. Direct threaded code improves tclbench benchmarks by about 5 % <b>over</b> <b>switch</b> dispatch. We review our catenation technique, which compiles bytecode using copied templates of Sparc code made from the normal C-compiled VM’s implementation of each virtual opcode. This eliminates all dispatch, but is impractical due to poor portability, and because the copying amplifies Tcl’s heavy instruction cache load. Based on subroutine threading, context threading generates native call instructions for dispatch. Simpler than catenation, it imposes much lower I-cache load. It preserves more interpreter state, is a better vehicle for mixed-mode execution, and accomodates interesting optimizations. Our implementation for Tcl on Sparc improves 97 % of benchmarks in the tclbench suite with more than 1000 dispatches, {{by an average of}} 9. 5 % <b>over</b> <b>switch</b> dispatch (12. 0 % and 16. 5 % for> 10000 and> 100000 dispatches, respectively. ...|$|E

40|$|Compilation to {{bytecode}} {{paired with}} interpretation {{is often used}} as a technique to easily build prototypes for new programming languages. Some languages, including Java, push this further and use the bytecode layer to isolate programs from the underlying platform. Current state-of-the-art commercial and research Java virtual machines implement advanced just-in-time and adaptive compilation techniques to deliver high-performance execution of Java bytecode. Yet, experimenting with new features such as adding new bytecodes or redesigning the type system can be a daunting task within these complex systems, when new features invalidate assumptions on which the internal dynamic optimizing compiler depends. On the other hand, simpler existing Java bytecode interpreters, written purely in high-level languages, deliver poor performance. The main motivation behind this thesis was to answer the question: How fast can a portable, easily modifiable Java bytecode interpreter be? In order to address this question, we have designed and developed the Sable VM research framework, a portable interpreter-based Java virtual machine written in portable C. In this thesis we introduce innovative techniques for implementing an efficient, yet portable Java bytecode interpreter. These techniques address three areas: instruction dispatch, memory management, and synchronization. Specifically, we show how to implement an inline-threaded engine {{in the presence of}} lazy code preparation, without incurring a high synchronization penalty. We then introduce a logical partitioning of runtime system memory that simplifies memory management, and a related sparse interface virtual table design for fast interface-method invocation. We show how to efficiently compute space-efficient garbage collection maps for verifiable bytecode. We also present a bidirectional object layout that simplifies garbage collection. Finally, we introduce an improvement to thin locks, eliminating busy-wait in case of contention. Our experiments within the Sable VM framework show that inline-threading [PR 98] Java delivers significant performance improvement <b>over</b> <b>switch</b> and direct-threading, that sparse interface tables cause no memory loss, and that our map computation algorithm delivers {{a very small number of}} distinct garbage collection maps. Our overall performance measurements show that, using our techniques, a portable interpreter can deliver competitive interpretation performance, and even surpass that of a less-portable state-of-the-art interpreter on some benchmarks...|$|E
