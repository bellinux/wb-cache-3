5|$|On October 8, 1972, {{the men of}} Alpha Phi {{voted to}} admit women into their chapter. They alerted National Headquarters, and National Secretary Robert H. Rubin replied telling Alpha Phi not to {{administer}} any degree <b>of</b> <b>ritual</b> until the issue could be discussed in person. When Rubin arrived at Rutgers on November 11, 1972, {{he learned that the}} first degree <b>of</b> <b>ritual</b> had been administered, which began formal probationary membership. Alpha Phi's charter was immediately revoked and their chapter was placed on suspension. On November 13, the former Alpha Phi chapter formally reorganized as Mu Upsilon Alpha. On October 7, 2007, Mu Upsilon Alpha became a chapter of Mu Beta Psi.|$|E

5|$|There {{are three}} {{categories}} <b>of</b> <b>ritual</b> in Lingbao Daoism. The first {{is known as}} the heavenly Golden Register of Rituals, and is carried out to prevent natural disasters. During the Tang Dynasty, this ritual was carried out in honour of the imperial family, but later it could be performed by anyone. The earthly Yellow Register ritual was performed to ensure the dead was at rest. The final type <b>of</b> <b>ritual,</b> which has not survived, was the human Jade Register, which was performed to ensure the salvation of mankind. Of the rituals that have survived, the Golden Register has assumed the role of the Jade register, ensuring salvation and preventing bad weather.|$|E

5|$|For many centuries, {{the people}} within the Nri hegemony were {{committed}} to peace. This religious pacifism was rooted in a belief that violence was an abomination which polluted the earth. Instead, the eze Nri could declare a form of excommunication from the odinani Nri against those who violated specific taboos. Members of the Ikénga could isolate entire communities via this form <b>of</b> <b>ritual</b> siege.|$|E
5|$|Its {{popularity}} has spread throughout Eastern Europe {{and the former}} Russian Empire, and – by way of migration – to other continents. In North America, borscht is often linked with either Jews or Mennonites, the groups who first brought it there from Europe. Today, several ethnic groups claim borscht, in its various local guises, as their own national dish and consume it as part <b>of</b> <b>ritual</b> meals within Eastern Orthodox, Greek Catholic, Roman Catholic, and Jewish religious traditions.|$|E

5|$|Merrifield opens The Archaeology <b>of</b> <b>Ritual</b> and Magic by {{discussing}} how archaeologists have understood magic and ritual practices in past societies, opining {{that on the}} whole {{it had been a}} neglected area of study. Looking at the archaeological evidence for ritual activity in the pre-Roman Iron Age and the Roman Iron Age of Britain, he discusses animal and human sacrifice, as well as the offering of votive deposits in rivers and other bodies of water. He moves on to explore the rituals surrounding death and burial, suggesting areas where this ritual activity is visible in the burial record of multiple societies. Merrifield goes on to discuss the archaeological evidence for ritual practices in Christian Europe, highlighting areas <b>of</b> <b>ritual</b> continuance from earlier pagan periods, in particular the deposition of metal goods in water. Looking at the evidence for foundation deposits in European buildings that likely had magico-religious purposes, he then looks at several examples of written charms and spells which have survived in the archaeological record.|$|E
5|$|Sallekhana {{differs from}} other forms <b>of</b> <b>ritual</b> deaths {{recognized}} in Jainism as appropriate. The other situations consider ritual death {{to be better}} for a mendicant than breaking his or her Five Great vows (Mahavrata). For example, celibacy {{is one of the}} Five vows, and ritual death is considered better than being raped or seduced or if the mendicant community would be defamed. A ritual death under these circumstances by consuming poison is believed to be better and allows for an auspicious rebirth.|$|E
5|$|The Archaeology <b>of</b> <b>Ritual</b> and Magic is {{an archaeological}} {{study of the}} {{material}} evidence for ritual and magical practices in Europe, containing a particular emphasis on London and South East England.

5|$|The {{exterior}} of the Baroque styled tabernacle is almost entirely adorned with decorations, such as curiously shaped niche shelves, floating drapes and many cherubs. Carvings of fruits such as grapes and pomegranates have been created to in the shape <b>of</b> <b>ritual</b> offerings, symbolizing the Blood of Christ and the Church. Among the floral elements, roses, daisies, and various types of four-petalled flowers can be found, including the indigenous chalchihuite.|$|E
5|$|While {{some were}} {{executed}} quickly, others were tortured before being killed. The public torture of prisoners was a traditional ritual in many tribes of the Eastern Woodlands. Captives {{might have to}} endure excruciating torture for hours and even days. The British Indian Department used its influence to discourage the killing and torturing of prisoners, with some success, but in 1782 the Indians revived the practice <b>of</b> <b>ritual</b> torture in order to exact revenge for the slaughter at Gnadenhütten.|$|E
5|$|Both sources {{agree that}} Alfano imposed his {{position}} when he defeated the Camorra head, the capintesta Totonno 'o Pappagallo (The Parrot) – so-named for his beak parrot nose – in a zumpata – a kind <b>of</b> <b>ritual</b> initiation knife duel – {{despite the fact}} that his adversary sent his Mastino dog to attack Alfano. The conflict started when Pappagallo returned from prison and found Alfano in control of his former territory. Other sources mention that after the death of Cappuccio, Giuseppe Chirico, 'o Granatiere (The Grenadier), from the Porta San Gennaro neighbourhood was elected. He was defeated in a zumpata by Totonno 'o Pappagallo, who took over the reign before being defeated by Alfano {{around the turn of the}} century.|$|E

40|$|Our {{lives are}} highly shaped by rituals. The way we wake up, {{the way we}} prepare tea or coffee are two <b>of</b> the many <b>rituals</b> many <b>of</b> us have constructed. As they {{structure}} our everyday lives, {{it is crucial to}} understand how to design them from a kansei design perspective. This Research-through-Design inquiry contributes to a larger research of addressing the way to design rituals. An annotated showcase <b>of</b> three <b>ritual</b> design projects is proposed. From the analysis of these three projects, we suggest 11 points of attention for the construction <b>of</b> a <b>ritual</b> visualization tool. This tool is expected to be used not only to support the analysis and the assessment <b>of</b> <b>rituals,</b> but also to contribute to the composition <b>of</b> <b>rituals,</b> towards the design <b>of</b> experientially rich <b>rituals</b> from an interaction perspective...|$|R

5|$|In 1975 the Guildhall Museum was amalgamated {{with the}} London Museum, {{creating}} the new Museum of London. Merrifield was appointed senior keeper, {{and soon after}} was promoted to deputy director. He retired in 1978 but remained active within the archaeological community, publishing The Archaeology <b>of</b> <b>Ritual</b> and Magic in 1987 and further studies of Roman London, and giving public lectures across the country. He was a keen supporter of the Standing Conference on London Archaeology, a body designed to monitor the impact that English Heritage was having on the city's archaeology, which he believed to be negative.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Lone Hvass of the Elsinore Museum, Miranda Aldhouse-Green of Cardiff University, and the Department of Forensic Science at the University of Århus {{performed}} a re-examination of the Haraldskær Woman. Forensic analysis revealed stomach contents of unhusked millet and blackberries. Her neck had a faint groove {{as if someone}} applied a rope for torture or strangulation. The scientists concluded bog acids caused the swelling of the knee joint and that the woman was probably already dead before the branches pinned her down. Because of her careful placement, and since cremation was the prevailing mode of interment during that period in Jutland, the examiners guess the Haraldskær Woman was a victim <b>of</b> <b>ritual</b> sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|Ritual {{scarification}} in Nri {{was known}} as Ichi {{of which there are}} two styles; the Nri style, and the Agbaja style. In the Nri style, the carved line ran {{from the center of the}} forehead down to the chin. A second line ran across the face, from the right cheek to the left. This was repeated to obtain a pattern meant to imitate the rays of the sun. In the Agbaja style, circles and semicircular patterns are added to the initial incisions to represent the moon. These scarifications were given to the representatives of the eze Nri; the mbùríchi. The scarification's were Nri's way of honoring the sun that they worshiped and was a form <b>of</b> <b>ritual</b> purification.|$|E
