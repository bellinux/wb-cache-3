5|$|Pain gave {{lands to}} Llanthony Priory, helping to {{establish}} the endowment of that monastic house, although {{it is difficult to}} distinguish his gifts from those of Hugh de Lacy, as the monks of Llanthony grouped the gifts of both men together in their records. In addition Pain granted lands to Gloucester Abbey, which had benefited from the generosity of his father and brother, as did his wife Sybil, together with <b>other</b> <b>grants</b> to her uncle the abbot. She also gave to two churches in Hereford: St Peter and St Guthlac.|$|E

5|$|After the Duke of Northumberland's {{attainder}} {{the entire}} Dudley inheritance had disappeared. His sons {{had to start}} from scratch in rebuilding the family fortunes, as they had renounced any rights to their father's former possessions or titles when their own attainders had been lifted in January 1558. Robert Dudley financed the lifestyle expected of a royal favourite by large loans from City of London merchants until in April 1560 Elizabeth granted him his first export licence, worth £6,000 p.a. He also received some of his father's lands, but since he was not the family heir {{it was a matter of}} some difficulty to find a suitable estate for his intended peerage. In June 1563 the Queen granted him Kenilworth Manor, Castle, and Park, together with the lordships of Denbigh and Chirk in North Wales. <b>Other</b> <b>grants</b> were to follow. Eventually, Leicester and his elder brother Ambrose, Earl of Warwick, came to preside over the greatest aristocratic interest in the West Midlands and North Wales.|$|E
5|$|Following the Olympics, {{there was}} extermely {{limited access to}} the {{waterways}} through the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, and reconstruction of Carpenters Road Lock was delayed. However, the £1.8 million project to rebuild it and fit new radial gates was almost completed by May 2017, when the new gates were craned into position. The Heritage Lottery Fund provided £680,000 towards {{the cost of the}} project, with <b>other</b> <b>grants</b> coming from the London Legacy Development Corporation and the Inland Waterways Association. As well as acting as a lock, the radial gates allow water to be distributed around the Bow Back Rivers for flood prevention purposes. The gates were due to be tested during the summer months, with a formal opening scheduled for the East London Waterways Festival in August. Public access to the waterways around the Olympic Stadium was also due to begin in June or July.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of grants of representation, each one designed to cover a particular circumstance. The most common cover the two most common situations—either the deceased died leaving a valid will or they did not. If someone left a valid will, it is more than likely that the grant is a grant of probate. If there was no will, the grant required {{is likely to be a}} grant of administration. There are many <b>other</b> <b>grants</b> that can be required in certain circumstances, and many have technical Latin names, but the general public is most likely to encounter grants of probate or administration. If an estate has a value of less than £5,000.00 or if all assets are held jointly and therefore pass by survivorship, for example to a surviving spouse, a grant is not usually required.|$|E
25|$|In 1937, Aberdare was {{appointed}} {{chairman of the}} National Fitness Council, the first attempt at a Sports Council in England.

It had a difficult two years before being dissolved in October 1939. These included liaison with existing statutory and voluntary organisations. In absorbing the Juvenile Organisations Committee and its local committees it alienated many who had worked towards bridging the gap between recreation provided at school and to the wider community (14–20 age group). In addition there was much support for compulsory physical training as opposed to the Council's approach of a voluntary ethos.|$|E

It also included a quarter of Nantwich, the largest salt producer in the county until the 17th century, with a tithe of the barony's salt revenues. The abbey was also given the church at Acton and its associated chapel of Nantwich, {{as well as two}} churches in Staffordshire, at Sandon and Alstonfield. The abbey later appropriated the church of Child's Ercall in Shropshire and the Cheshire churches and chapels of Baddiley, Church Coppenhall, Church Minshull and Wrenbury. Numerous <b>other</b> <b>grants</b> of land followed in the 12th and early 13th centuries, mainly in the south of Cheshire and the adjacent counties of Staffordshire and Shropshire, but also in Derbyshire. Other benefactors included William Malbank, who confirmed his father's grant and added further land, Robert de Ferrers, the Earl of Derby, William FitzAlan, William FitzRanulph and Ivo Pantulf, and later Ranulph de Blondeville (also Ranulph III), the Earl of Chester, Roger of Ightfield, Gilbert de Macclesfield, James de Audley and Robert de Baskerville.|$|E
500|$|Shute {{also made}} <b>other</b> <b>grants</b> of townships in {{land that is}} part of the modern state of New Hampshire. [...] However, much of southwestern New Hampshire was at the time disputed between the two provinces Shute governed, and grants he made in that area went to Massachusetts interests. [...] This upset a number of New Hampshire politicians, notably Lieutenant Governor Wentworth. [...] Wentworth used discontent over these grants, {{combined}} with competing ones that he issued himself under New Hampshire authority, to build a power base that would eventually (after his death) successfully lobby for the separation of the governorships.|$|E
500|$|During the 14th {{century the}} castle {{was allowed to}} fall into disrepair. From Edward III onwards, [...] little money was spent on {{maintaining}} the property and by the 15th century the castle was in ruins. The castle hall and chamber were roofless by the 15th century, and Henry VI ordered these buildings to be destroyed and the stone reused for constructing King's College in 1441, with {{other parts of the}} castle being used to help build Trinity College's chapel. More stonework was given away by Mary I in the 16th century for building a mansion at nearby Sawston in the Fens, and <b>other</b> <b>grants</b> of stone given to Emmanuel and Magdalene colleges.

500|$|On 12 December 1989, the {{committee}} sent an official offer to Hordaland Public Roads Administration whereby they, {{as a company}} under establishment, offered to fully finance the tunnel. The plans called for tolls of [...] for a car and an investment cost of NOK47 million. The plans were at first nearly discarded by the administration, as they felt {{it was impossible for}} a community of 400 people to finance such a large project without <b>other</b> <b>grants.</b> However, it became evident that the administration was spending NOK2 million per year on the ferry service, and as the ferry soon would have to be replaced, this would increase to NOK3 to 5 million per year. On 1 October 1990, the issue was considered by Hordaland Transport Board, which approved the plans. This was followed up by Hordaland County Council on 19 June 1991, which involved NOK27 million being financed by debt and NOK28 to 33 million being financed through reduced subsidies to the ferry.|$|E
500|$|In between Novel {{sections}} are Escape sections, which {{occur when}} the player arrives in a room from which they {{need to find a}} means of escape. These are presented from a first-person perspective, with the player able to move between predetermined positions in each room. To escape, the player is tasked with finding various items and solving puzzles, reminiscent of escape-the-room games. At some points, the player may need to combine objects with each other to create the necessary tool to complete a puzzle. The puzzles include various brain teasers, such as Lights Out and sliding puzzles. In each Escape room, a safe can be found, which can be opened with two passwords. One of these passwords gives the player the key needed to escape from the room, while the <b>other</b> <b>grants</b> access to a hidden folder that provides the player with supplementary backstory or other information. The player receives hints to the puzzle solutions from the game's characters; further, more direct, hints are received if the player changes the puzzle's difficulty level from [...] "hard" [...] to [...] "easy".|$|E
