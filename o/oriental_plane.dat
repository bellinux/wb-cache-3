5|$|Very {{little is}} known about the mid-18th century planting, {{although}} there remains, in front of the house, a gnarled black mulberry tree, which was described as ancient in 1822. However, 19th-century drawings and photographs record increasingly elaborate and fussy bedding schemes, finally swept away in the 1960s. Today there is a more informal style, emphasising the architectural character of the garden with its long straight sweeps of wall; it is also an easier style to maintain. In recent years, native wild plants have been allowed to mingle with rare and exotic specimens and continual thought is being given to contrasting textures and colours of foliage. The lower garden, below the front of the house, now has the air of a small arboretum with a number of fine specimen trees, such as a splendid late-leafing catalpa (an <b>oriental</b> <b>plane</b> tree) dominates this part of the garden and the grass at its foot is left uncut during the Spring, allowing camassias and bluebells to make a fine showing.|$|E

50|$|One {{example of}} an early European tree {{collection}} is the Trsteno Arboretum, near Dubrovnik in Croatia. The date of its founding is unknown, but it was already in existence by 1492, when a 15 m (50 ft) span aqueduct to irrigate the arboretum was constructed; this aqueduct is still in use. The garden {{was created by the}} prominent local Gučetić/Gozze family. It suffered two major disasters in the 1990s but its two unique and ancient <b>Oriental</b> <b>Planes</b> remained standing.|$|R
50|$|The {{pride of}} the arboretum, two <b>Oriental</b> <b>Planes</b> located on the central market place of Trsteno, survived both {{disasters}} undamaged. They are over 500 years old and are unique specimens {{of its kind in}} Europe. The ancient trees are both about 45/60 m tall and their trunks are 5 m in diameter. Within what was once the noble family's country house, there is the oldest Renaissance park in Croatia, designed in 1502, with numerous exotic plants.|$|R
50|$|Τhe {{black pine}} dominates {{on the eastern}} and {{northern}} side of the mountain, between 500 and 1,700 metres. In this zone there is also hybrid fir in small groups and scrubs or small clumps, particularly in the lower region and in the sites Naoumi (west) and Stalamatia and Polykastro (east), where it is mixed with black pine and Bosnian pine. In this zone there is also beech. While in the neighboring mountains Pierians and Ossa it creates an extended vegetation zone, in Olympus it is restricted to small clusters, appearing as islets, mainly in more humid locations and the best soils. A particularly rich variety of trees and shrubs is found in Enipeas' gorge. One can see there elm, cherry plum, European yew, hazel, holly, cornus mas, manna ash, maple and a considerable variety of herbaceous plants. Gorges and ravines are covered by <b>oriental</b> <b>planes,</b> willows, black alders and riverside greenery.|$|R
25|$|Vegetation in {{the region}} includes, firs, oaks, conifers, platanus, willow, olive trees, poplar, hawthorn, <b>oriental</b> <b>plane,</b> cherry plum, rose hips, {{pistachio}} trees, rosaceae, pear, mountain ash poplar. The desert in the south is mostly steppe and would feature xeric plants such as palm trees, tamarix, date palm, fraxinus, poa, white wormwood and chenopodiaceae. Animals found {{in the region}} include the Syrian brown bear, wild boar, gray wolf, golden jackal, Indian crested porcupine, red fox, goitered gazelle, Eurasian otter, striped hyena, Persian fallow deer, onager, mangar and the Euphrates softshell turtle. Bird species include, the see-see partridge, Menetries's warbler, western jackdaw, hooded crow, European nightjar, rufous-tailed scrub robin, masked shrike and the pale rockfinch.|$|E
25|$|Tamburs {{are made}} {{almost entirely of}} wood. The shell (Tekne) is {{assembled}} from strips of hardwood called ribs joined edge to edge to form a semi-spherical body for the instrument. The number of ribs traditionally amounts to 17, 21 or 23, yet examples with slightly wider and consequently fewer ribs (7, 9 or 11) {{can also be found}} among older specimens. Traditionally, thinner strips called fileto are inserted between the ribs for ornamental purposes, but are not obligatory. The most common tonewood veneers used for rib-making are mahogany, flame maple, Persian walnut, Mecca balsam wood (Commiphora gileadensis), Spanish chestnut, Greek juniper, mulberry, <b>Oriental</b> <b>plane,</b> Indian rosewood and apricot. Ribs are assembled on the bottom wedge (tail) and the heel on which the fingerboard is mounted.|$|E
25|$|The Euphrates {{flows through}} a number of {{distinct}} vegetation zones. Although millennia-long human occupation {{in most parts of the}} Euphrates basin has significantly degraded the landscape, patches of original vegetation remain. The steady drop in annual rainfall from the sources of the Euphrates toward the Persian Gulf is a strong determinant for the vegetation that can be supported. In its upper reaches the Euphrates flows through the mountains of Southeast Turkey and their southern foothills which support a xeric woodland. Plant species in the moister parts of this zone include various oaks, pistachio trees, and Rosaceae (rose/plum family). The drier parts of the xeric woodland zone supports less dense oak forest and Rosaceae. Here can also be found the wild variants of many cereals, including einkorn wheat, emmer wheat, oat and rye. South of this zone lies a zone of mixed woodland-steppe vegetation. Between Raqqa and the Syro–Iraqi border the Euphrates flows through a steppe landscape. This steppe is characterised by white wormwood (Artemisia herba-alba) and Chenopodiaceae. Throughout history, this zone has been heavily overgrazed due to the practicing of sheep and goat pastoralism by its inhabitants. Southeast of the border between Syria and Iraq starts true desert. This zone supports either no vegetation at all or small pockets of Chenopodiaceae or Poa sinaica. Although today nothing of it survives due to human interference, research suggests that the Euphrates Valley would have supported a riverine forest. Species characteristic of this type of forest include the <b>Oriental</b> <b>plane,</b> the Euphrates poplar, the tamarisk, the ash and various wetland plants.|$|E

40|$|Conference Theme: Asia in Motion: Horizons of HopeIn {{the summer}} of 1953, the Associate Press wired a story that began “Japanese stewardesses will provide an {{atmosphere}} of <b>Oriental</b> comfort aboard <b>planes</b> of the Japan Air Lines when service is inaugurated. ” Soon it was printed in 42 American newspapers. The headlines were not “Japanese airline to Launch its Transpacific Service,” but rather “Stewardesses to Don Kimonos. ” This paper examines Japan Airlines’ kimono-branding exercise aimed at distinguishing itself from its then-competitors, Pan American Airlines and Northwest Orient. American fascination with the geisha was given new impetus during the Allied Occupation of Japan, when {{a few hundred thousand}} American servicemen were stationed in the country. JAL played on the fascination with kimono-clad women to entice American male travelers with Japanese exoticism. But at the same time, JAL executives were keen to set their flight attendants apart from the “geisha girls” and project a “proper” image of Japan. The company invested considerable efforts in selecting high-quality kimonos, by appointing a prestigious store in Ginza, which fashioned kimonos for the ladies of the court of Tokugawa. Every flight attendant chose her own silk fabric for her own tailor-made kimono, which had to be approved by JAL’s public affairs manager who accompanied her to the store. By 1957, JAL introduced detailed regulations on the make of silk fabric, the weaving density, and the patterns to assure proper look for the national flag carrier. I will discuss JAL’s strategies to present and represent Japan to passengers on transpacific flights in the 1950 s...|$|R

60|$|It is {{just the}} same {{with all the other}} animals and plants that now inhabit these isles of Britain. If there be {{anything}} at all with a claim to be considered really indigenous, it is the Scotch ptarmigan and the Alpine hare, the northern holygrass and the mountain flowers of the Highland summits. All the rest are sojourners and wayfarers, brought across as casuals, like the gipsies and the <b>Oriental</b> <b>plane,</b> at various times to the United Kingdom, some of them recently, some of them long ago, but not one of them (it seems), except the oyster, a true native. The common brown rat, for instance, as everybody knows, came over, not, it is true, with William the Conqueror, but with the Hanoverian dynasty and King George I. of blessed memory. The familiar cockroach, or 'black beetle,' of our lower regions, is an Oriental importation of the last century. The hum of the mosquito is now just beginning to be heard in the land, especially in some big London hotels. The Colorado beetle is hourly expected by Cunard steamer. The Canadian roadside erigeron is well established already in the remoter suburbs; the phylloxera battens on our hothouse vines; the American river-weed stops the navigation on our principal canals. The Ganges and the Mississippi have long since flooded the tawny Thames, as Juvenal's cynical friend declared the Syrian Orontes had flooded the Tiber. And what has thus been going on slowly within the memory of the last few generations has been going on constantly from time immemorial, and peopling Britain in all its parts with its now existing fauna and flora.|$|E
