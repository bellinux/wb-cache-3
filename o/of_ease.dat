St Mary's, which is about 0.75miles (1.25km) to the west, is no longer used for services either, but is in ruins.|$|E

5|$|St Mary's Church, Rhodogeidio {{is a small}} medieval church, {{dating from}} the 15th century, near Llannerch-y-medd, in Anglesey, north Wales. It served as a chapel <b>of</b> <b>ease</b> to another church in the area, St Ceidio's. Some {{restoration}} work {{was carried out in}} the 19th century, but St Mary's has since fallen into disuse and is now largely in ruins.|$|E

It is named after a small chapel <b>of</b> <b>ease</b> dedicated to St Mary and connects Aldgate to the west (as Whitechapel High Street) with Mile End Road to the east. The road {{is part of the}} historic Roman road from London to Colchester, now the A11.|$|E
5|$|All Saints' Church, Shuart , in the north-west of the Isle of Thanet, Kent, in the {{south-east}} of England, {{was established}} in the Anglo-Saxon period as a chapel <b>of</b> <b>ease</b> for the parish of St Mary's Church, Reculver, which was centred on the north-eastern corner of mainland Kent, adjacent to the island. The Isle of Thanet was then separated from the mainland by the sea, which formed a strait known as the Wantsum Channel. The last church on the site was demolished by the early 17th century, and there is nothing remaining above ground to show that a church once stood there.|$|E

5|$|During {{the medieval}} and post-medieval periods the {{township}} of Altrincham {{was part of}} Bowdon parish. Low population density meant that the town {{did not have a}} church until the Anglican church established a chapel <b>of</b> <b>ease</b> in 1799. Nonconformists were also present in Altrincham; Methodists set up a chapel in 1790, and Baptists built one in the 1870s. Irish immigrants in the 1830s and 1840s also returned Roman Catholicism to the area, the first Roman Catholic church built in Altrincham being St Vincent's, in 1860.|$|E
5|$|During {{this time}} the church at Llanbadarn Fawr {{gradually}} declined, as the population of Aberystwyth dramatically outgrew the original settlement, {{and more and more}} chapels <b>of</b> <b>ease</b> became independent parish churches. By the mid-nineteenth century the fabric of the church had also deteriorated {{to such an extent that}} serious remedial work was deemed necessary. Unfortunately, although necessary, this work also swept away much of the detail of the interior of the church. Today, apart from the Celtic crosses and the baptismal font there is nothing mediaeval or even early modern; most of what is visible today is nineteenth century, apart from the structure of the church, and some earlier monuments.|$|E
5|$|Historically {{a part of}} Lancashire, Milnrow {{during the}} Middle Ages was a hamlet located within the {{township}} of Butterworth and parish of Rochdale. It was named by the Anglo-Saxons, but the Norman conquest of England resulted in its ownership by minor Norman families, such as the Schofields and Cleggs. In the 15th century, the descendants of these families successfully agitated for a chapel <b>of</b> <b>ease</b> to be constructed in Milnrow by {{the banks of the}} River Beal, triggering its development as the main settlement in Butterworth. Despite this distinction, Milnrow did not increase much further in size or population until the dawn of the woollen trade in the Late Middle Ages.|$|E
40|$|The {{virtues of}} {{deterministic}} parallelism have been argued {{for decades and}} many forms of deterministic parallelism have been described and analyzed. Here we are concerned {{with one of the}} strongest forms, requiring that for any input there is a unique dependence graph representing a trace of the computation annotated with every operation and value. This has been referred to as internal determinism, and implies a sequential semanticsâ€”i. e., considering any sequential traversal of the dependence graph is sufficient for analyzing the correctness of the code. In addition to returning deterministic results, internal determinism has many advantages including <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> reasoning about the code, <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> verifying correctness, <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> debugging, <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> defining invariants, <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> defining good coverage for testing, and <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> formally, informally and experimentally reasoning about performance.

5|$|In 1788, a small Episcopal church {{called the}} Zion Chapel <b>of</b> <b>Ease</b> was {{constructed}} for plantation owners. The chapel's old cemetery, {{located near the}} corner of William Hilton Parkway and Mathews Drive (Folly Field), is all that remains. Charles Davant, a prominent island planter during the Revolutionary War, is buried there. Davant was shot by Captain Martinangel of Daufuskie Island in 1781. This location {{is also home to}} the oldest intact structure on Hilton Head Island, the Baynard Mausoleum, which was built in 1846.|$|E
5|$|In September 2015 {{the parish}} was united with the {{neighbouring}} parish of St Barnabas, Oxford, {{to form the}} new parish of St Barnabas and St Paul, with St Thomas the Martyr, Oxford. St Barnabas is the parish church and St Thomas is the chapel <b>of</b> <b>ease.</b> The first vicar of the new parish is Fr Jonathan Beswick; the Hon. Asst. Priest is Fr Andrew Greany.|$|E
5|$|In later years, {{because it}} was {{impossible}} for parishioners to travel to Llanbadarn Fawr from the more distant parts of the parish, the church eventually had many chapels <b>of</b> <b>ease,</b> as the population of the parish grew. One example of the latter is All Saints Church, Llangorwen, which was built in the early 1840s. In the course of the nineteenth century the original parish of Llanbadarn Fawr was finally divided into some 17 new parishes, comprising 20 churches.|$|E

He was the incumbent priest of St Nidan's and its chapels <b>of</b> <b>ease</b> from 1696 {{until his death in}} 1723, and wrote a history of Anglesey, Mona Antiqua Restaurata. Maurice Wilks, who invented the Land Rover, is buried in the churchyard. He had a farm nearby in Newborough and some prototype testing of the Land Rover was carried out in Anglesey.|$|E
5|$|The huge {{extent of}} the mediaeval parish of Llanbadarn made Sunday worship {{impossible}} for distant inhabitants, so early centres with a Christian identity like Llanychaearn and Llaneithr would act as chapels <b>of</b> <b>ease,</b> and later churches whether built by Welsh princes (such as Llanfihangel-y-Creuddyn) or Norman lords (e.g. Llanfihangel Genau'r Glyn) were also subordinate to Llanbadarn before developing as separate parishes. Churches like Llanbadarn with a large hinterland of lesser churches are often known as mam-eglwysi, mother churches. There were no parishes in Wales prior to {{the coming of the}} Normans.|$|E

Around the start of the 20th century, the increasing range of naval engagements, as demonstrated by the Battle of Tsushima, prompted the introduction of the first camouflage, in the form of some solid shade of gray overall, in the hope that ships would fade into the mist.|$|E

5|$|Early worship {{took place}} at the parish church of Manchester, however a small chantry chapel existed in 1368 on the only bridge linking the two settlements. In the 16th century, it was {{converted}} into a dungeon, and was later demolished in 1779. In 1634â€“35, Humphrey Booth, a wealthy local merchant, opened a chapel <b>of</b> <b>ease,</b> which a year later was consecrated as the Chapel of Sacred Trinity (the parish of Sacred Trinity was created in 1650). John Wesley preached in the building, before his break with the Anglican Church. Upon his return in 1747 however he preached in the open, at Salford Cross. The chapel was rebuilt in about 1752â€“53, although the tower probably belonged to the original building. It was restored in 1871â€“74 by the architect J. P. Holden and a chapel was added to the south-east in 1934. It is now a Grade II* listed building.|$|E
5|$|In 1606 Adam Mort {{bought the}} manor house and land in Astley. He was {{a wealthy man}} who built the first Astley Chapel as a chapel <b>of</b> <b>ease</b> for the parish church in Leigh. The chapel was consecrated in 1631, the year that he died. He built a grammar school that stood for over 200years until 1833, when it was {{demolished}} and rebuilt. Adam Mort's grandson, also Adam, rebuilt Damhouse in 1650 and his initials are carved in the plaque over the front door. The stone and timber structure was named from the stream which was dammed to supply water to a waterwheel powering a corn mill near the house. It is possible the hall was once surrounded by a moat.|$|E
5|$|In 1836 {{architect}} John Harper {{arranged a}} small exhibition in York {{of works by}} modern artists, which included 11 Etty paintings. This included the first public showing of Venus and her Doves, which had been commissioned by Daniel Grant. Although the exhibition broke even it met with little public interest, and no further Etty retrospectives were held for some years. Harper did {{take the opportunity to}} buy Etty's A Family of the Forest (also known as Flowers of the Forest), which had failed to sell at the 1836 Summer Exhibition. A Family of the Forest illustrates a passage from the Ancient Greek poem Theogony, dealing with the Golden Age before humanity suffered pain, misery or the need to work.
