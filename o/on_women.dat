[...] She argued that the Judiciary Committee, which had {{jurisdiction}} over the issue, was too busy with other matters to address suffrage for women. During a May 18, 1917 hearing, numerous Representatives, including Jeannette Rankin, the only female member of the House, urged the House Rules Committee to create the Committee <b>on</b> <b>Woman</b> Suffrage. The U.S. Senate had established the Select Committee <b>on</b> <b>Woman</b> Suffrage in 1882.|$|R

Women there use their wages to create women's centers aimed at providing legal and medical services, libraries and cooperative housing, to local community members. Such efforts, Bergeron highlights, allow women the chance to take control of economic conditions, increase their sense of individualism, and alter the pace and direction of globalization itself.|$|E

5|$|Before the 20th century, and in {{some cases}} as late as the 1940s, historians largely took ancient {{literary}} sources at face value as evidence for the lives of women in the ancient world. In the middle of the 20th century this began to change. Early innovations in the study of women in ancient history began in France, as the Annales School began to take a greater interest in underrepresented groups. Robert Flacelière was an influential early author <b>on</b> <b>women</b> in Greece. Around the same time, feminist philosophy, such as Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex also examined the lives of women in the classical world.|$|E

This made the issue of women's place in the movement important in the 1930s. It was also recognized that many congregations who could not afford male pastors relied <b>on</b> <b>women</b> preachers. Despite the fact that opposition to female pastors had been regularly affirmed since 1914, the office of pastor was opened to women in 1935.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{literary}} critics see the poem as portraying women's ultimate power over men.

The girdle and Gawain's scar {{can be seen as}} symbols of feminine power, each of them diminishing Gawain's masculinity. Gawain's misogynist passage, in which he blames all of his troubles <b>on</b> <b>women</b> and lists the many men who have fallen prey to women's wiles, further supports the feminist view of ultimate female power in the poem.|$|E

5|$|Amongst {{non-governmental}} organizations (NGOs) working to end child marriage are Girls not Brides, Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA), the International Center for Research <b>on</b> <b>Women</b> (ICRW) and Human Rights Watch (HRW). Although not explicitly {{included in the}} original Millennium Development Goals, considerable pressure was applied to include ending child marriage in the successor Sustainable Development Goals adopted in September 2015, where ending this practice by 2030 is a target of SDG 5 Gender Equality (see above). While some {{progress is being made}} in reducing child marriage, particularly for girls under fifteen, the prospects are daunting. The indicator for this will be the percentage of women aged 20–24 who were married or in a union before the age of eighteen. Efforts to end child marriage include legislation and ensuring enforcement together with empowering women and girls. To raise awareness, the inaugural UN International Day of the Girl Child in 2012 was dedicated to ending child marriage.|$|E
