5|$|The {{main problem}} remains, as Jona Lendering points out, that most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> know about Aspasia {{are based on}} mere hypothesis. Thucydides does not mention her; our only sources are the untrustworthy {{representations}} and speculations recorded by men in literature and philosophy, who did not care at all about Aspasia as a historical character. Therefore, in the figure of Aspasia, we get a range of contradictory portrayals; she is either a good wife like Theano {{or some combination of}} courtesan and prostitute like Thargelia. This is the reason modern scholars express their scepticism about the historicity of Aspasia's life.|$|E

500|$|Recording for {{the album}} began in 2008, {{less than a}} year after the release of Minutes to Midnight (2007). As with Minutes to Midnight, Shinoda and Rick Rubin {{produced}} the album. Primary recording sessions for A Thousand Suns took place at NRG Recording Studios in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. In November 2008, lead singer Chester Bennington said the new record was a concept album; he said it [...] "sound a little daunting to me, so, I think my confidence level will drop, but when it was presented to us by this friend of ours, we liked the idea. It was an inspiring idea, and it was something we could relate a lot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> like to write about to." ...|$|E
500|$|Waters {{was drawn}} to the Victorian era because of the (mis)understandings of what social norms existed during the period. As she stated, [...] "I find it a {{fascinating}} period because it feels very close to us, and yet in lots of ways it is utterly strange: many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> think we know about it are stereotypes, or simply wrong." [...] Considering herself part of gay and lesbian literary heritage, Waters was influenced by Oscar Wilde, and Chris Hunt, who wrote Street Lavender, an historical novel with gay male themes also set in the Victorian era. She has stated that Tipping the Velvet is a female version of Street Lavender, with a plot similar to My Secret Life by [...] "Walter".|$|E
50|$|Gadamer {{pointed out}} that {{prejudice}} {{is an element of}} our understanding and is not per se without value. Indeed, prejudices, in <b>the</b> sense <b>of</b> pre-judgements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> want to understand, are unavoidable. Being alien to a particular tradition is a condition of our understanding. He said that we can never step outside of our tradition — {{all we can do is}} try to understand it. This further elaborates <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hermeneutic circle.|$|R

50|$|He {{concludes that}} though people can {{contemplate}} <b>the</b> same <b>thing,</b> <b>we</b> cannot contemplate 'the intuitive apprehension' of another. This connotes <b>the</b> Sartrean idea <b>of</b> becoming apprehensive about the awareness {{that we are}} to be responsible for our own doings, and also that we can be conscious <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> like another consciousness is conscious <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing,</b> but <b>we</b> cannot reflect on their being conscious <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> like <b>we</b> can reflect on our being conscious <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing.</b> In this way we are still only condemned to making ourselves as we battle with our own consciousness, and so we don’t create the world, we are objects in the world.|$|R
500|$|On the game's community, Adams said, [...] "They are {{the reason}} I've {{been able to make}} the step from {{hobbyist}} to full-time developer. I'm lucky to be able to run with whatever ideas we have and try new things." [...] On players sending him forum posts or emails detailing their stories or events that happened during the game, Adams said, [...] "It's really gratifying, because it's one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> set out to do is to get people to write these narratives about their game." [...] Adams has admitted that some feats of the community surprised even him. Adams stated that the most impressive thing he had ever seen done with the game was when a player managed to create a Turing-complete 8-bit computer powered by dwarves.|$|E
500|$|There are {{two songs}} about falling in love, [...] "Mi Lugar Favorito" [...] and [...] "Vámonos Negrito". The former, {{arranged}} to emulate emotional outbursts, {{was the most}} difficult to finish, and the singer had a hard time trying to find the right place for it on the album. [...] "Vámonos Negrito" [...] is a tribute to her Latin American roots that she started writing after a show in Colombia and finished in Cuba; in this song, one of her favorites, she tried to create a musical landscape with instruments, textures, and harmonies. The bolero [...] "Antes de Huir", is a [...] "sad and hopeful" [...] song. It is about not letting go <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> love. [...] "Ya No Te Puedo Querer" [...] is, according to Lafourcade, an obscure folk-pop song about finding that one cannot be in a relationship anymore; it was written during a concert tour in Monterrey.|$|E
500|$|When Hopkins {{began to}} {{circulate}} cassette {{copies of the}} album to the music press a few weeks later, he required that each journalist sign a contract containing a clause requiring that the cassette recipient, according to Select journalist Mark Perry, [...] "not discuss the album with anyone—including your partner at home. It basically said don't talk to your girlfriend about it when you're at home in bed." [...] The Mail on Sunday wrote of Russell [...] " [...] has a mind like a steel trap and the organisational skills of Winston Churchill." [...] Reflecting in 1999, Greengrass admitted: [...] "In retrospect a lot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> did were ridiculous. We sit in [...] meetings today and we're like 'It's on the Internet. It's in Camden Market. Whatever'. I think we've learned our lesson." [...] According to Perry: [...] "It seemed, particularly once you heard the album, that this was cocaine grandeur of just the most ludicrous degree. I remember listening to [...] "All Around the World" [...] and laughing—actually quite pleasurably—because it seemed so ridiculous. You just thought: Christ, {{there is so much}} coke being done here." ...|$|E

500|$|The 30 March 1967 photo {{session with}} Cooper also {{produced}} {{the back cover}} and the inside gatefold, which the musicologist Ian Inglis describes as conveying [...] "an obvious and immediate warmth... which distances it from the sterility and artifice typical of such images". McCartney explained: [...] "One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> were very much into {{in those days was}} eye messages... So with Michael Cooper's inside photo, we all said, 'Now look into this camera and really say I love you! Really try and feel love; really give love through this! It'll come out; it'll show; it's an attitude.' And that's what that is, {{if you look at it}} you'll see the big effort from the eyes." [...] The album's inner sleeve featured artwork by the Dutch design team the Fool that eschewed for the first time the standard white paper in favour of an abstract pattern of waves of maroon, red, pink and white. Included with the album as a bonus gift was a sheet of cardboard cut-outs designed by Blake and Haworth, a postcard-sized portrait of Sgt. Pepper based on a statue from Lennon's house that was used on the front cover, a fake moustache, two sets of sergeant stripes, two lapel badges and a stand-up cut-out of the Beatles in their satin uniforms. Moore believes that the inclusion of these items helped fans [...] "pretend to be in the band". However, many others have speculated that there may be a deeper meaning.|$|E
500|$|The New 52 ongoing {{series are}} {{organized}} under seven different [...] "families," [...] grouping similar characters or themes within the books together. By {{the release of}} the October 2013 solicitations, DC was no longer grouping the titles by these families. They instead began releasing one larger solicit, titled [...] "The New 52 Group". However, titles that were not participating in an event for the month, such as [...] "Forever Evil", were still grouped together in the larger solicit by the previous family headings. In September 2014, DC co-publisher Dan DiDio spoke about classifying the titles into the families, saying, [...] "one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> did, when we launched the New 52, we broke those classifications up {{in a way that we}} were able to draw attention to all the characters. So we put them in groupings so we would be able to promote and help them draw attention in groups. It was never made to be a certain amount different stuff. We always want to have different styles of product... with a lot of characters, we're careful. Things like Frankenstein and Grifter and Voodoo and things of that nature, which were really risky characters and risky chances for us to take, and we're very happy to do them. Even though they didn't work, we knew there was value in those characters... We think they brought a lot of value to the launch. They brought a lot of breadth and depth to the line of books, and a diversity to the line. We didn't want to put them out and then forget about them. It was very important to make sure that they were prominent in other series, and that's why we put them in" [...] other series.|$|E
