40|$|Background:Obesity is {{associated}} with a higher risk <b>of</b> aggressive <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer</b> and alters circulating levels of insulin and adiponectin, two hormones that influence biologic processes implicated in carcino-genesis. Results of some studies showed associations of circulating levels of adiponectin, insulin, and c-peptide (a marker of insulin secretion) with aggressive <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer,</b> but the size of these studies was limited. Methods:Anested case–control study <b>of</b> 272 aggressive <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer</b> cases [Gleason score 7 (4 þ 3) or T 3 -T 4] and 272 age- and race-matched controls from the Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort was conducted to determine the associations of prediagnostic plasma levels of c-peptide and adiponectin with risk <b>of</b> aggressive <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer.</b> Results: Neither circulating adiponectin nor c-peptide was associated with risk <b>of</b> aggressive <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer.</b> In analyses <b>of</b> the highest-risk aggressive <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer</b> (Gleason score 8 or T 3 -T 4), the highest quartile of c-peptide, compared with the lowest, was associated with an OR of 1. 41 [95 % confidence interval (CI), 0. 72 – 2. 78]. Conclusions:Our findings provide no support for the hypothesis that adiponectin {{is associated}} with risk <b>of</b> aggressive <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer</b> but a possible association of high levels of c-peptide with particularly high-risk <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer</b> cannot be ruled out.

25|$|The {{data on the}} {{relationship}} between diet and prostate cancer is poor. In light of this the rate <b>of</b> <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer</b> is linked to the consumption of the Western diet. There is little if any evidence to support an association between trans fat, saturated fat and carbohydrate intake and risk <b>of</b> <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer.</b> Evidence regarding the role of omega-3 fatty acids in preventing prostate cancer does not suggest that they reduce the risk <b>of</b> <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer,</b> although additional research is needed. Vitamin supplements appear to have no effect and some may increase the risk. High calcium intake has been linked to advanced prostate cancer. Consuming fish may lower prostate cancer deaths but does not appear to affect its occurrence. Some evidence supports lower rates <b>of</b> <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer</b> with a vegetarian diet. There is some tentative evidence for foods containing lycopene and selenium.

40|$|<b>Prostate</b> <b>cancer</b> is one <b>of</b> {{the leading}} causes of cancer-related deaths for men in the United States. Like other malignancies, <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer</b> is underscored {{by a variety of}} {{aberrant}} genetic alterations during its development. Although loss of heterozygosity or allelic loss is frequently identified among <b>prostate</b> <b>cancers,</b> few genes have been identified thus far as critical to the development <b>of</b> invasive <b>prostate</b> <b>cancers.</b> In this report, we used the recently developed technology, the “differential subtraction chain,” to perform a genome-wide search for sequences that are deleted in an aggressive <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer.</b> Among the deleted sequences, we found that one sequence was deleted in > 50 % <b>of</b> <b>prostate</b> <b>cancers</b> we tested. We mapped this sequence to chromosome 4 q 25 by screening the Genebridge 4 hamster radiation panel with primers specific to this probe, and subsequently identify a 54 -kb minimal common deletion region that contains the sequence encoding myopodin. Sequence analysis indicates that myopodin shares significant homology with synaptopodin, a protein closely associated with podocyte and neuron differentiation. Further study shows that frequent complete or partial deletions of the myopodin gene occurred among invasive <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer</b> cases (25 <b>of</b> 31 cases, or 80 %). Statistical analysis indicates that deletion of myopodin is highly correlated with the invasiveness <b>of</b> <b>prostate</b> <b>cancers,</b> and thus may hold promise as an important prognostic marker for <b>prostate</b> <b>cancers...</b>|$|R
