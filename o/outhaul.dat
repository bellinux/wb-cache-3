Kicking straps/boom vangs control a boom-footed sail's leech tension by exerting downward force mid-boom. Cunninghams tighten the luff of a boom-footed sail by pulling downward on a cringle in the luff of a mainsail above the tack.

50|$|North Stars {{were also}} {{employed}} by 412 Squadron RCAF on various VIP transport duties and, overall, the aircraft provided valuable and reliable long range transport {{services for the}} RCAF. From 1950 to 1952, during the Korean War, RCAF North Star aircraft were employed ferrying supplies to Korea across the Pacific Ocean. They flew 599 round trips over the Pacific and delivered seven million pounds of cargo and 13,000 personnel on return trips. They flew 1.9 million miles without a fatal crash and <b>outhauled</b> the United States Air Force C-54s on the Korean run. After 1967, the remaining North Stars were assigned to No. 426 Transport Squadron RCAF initially deployed to Dorval, Quebec and then to Trenton, Ontario. Gradually, their service life diminished in the 1970s and most were declared surplus.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>outhaul</b> {{runs from}} the clew of the sail to the free end of the boom. Hauling in on (tightening) the <b>outhaul</b> {{increases}} foot tension in the main sail. Modern loose footed sails are cut so that the <b>outhaul</b> is also able to pull the clew downwards towards the boom.|$|E
50|$|The <b>outhaul,</b> besides simply {{holding the}} sail out, is an {{effective}} sail shape control. Tightening or slackening the <b>outhaul</b> can flatten or fill out the sail, shift the draft forward or aft, change leech and foot tension, and increase or decrease camber.|$|E

5000|$|The sail is tuned by {{adjusting}} the downhaul and the <b>outhaul</b> tension. Generally, a sail is trimmed more (flatter shape) for stronger winds. More downhaul tension loosens {{the upper part of}} the leech, allowing the top of the sail to twist and [...] "spill" [...] wind during gusts, shifting the center of effort (strictly, the center of pressure) down. Releasing downhaul tension shifts the center of effort up. More <b>outhaul</b> lowers the camber/draft, making the sail flatter and easier to control, but less powerful; less <b>outhaul</b> results in more draft, providing more low-end power, but usually limiting speed by increasing aerodynamic resistance.|$|E

50|$|A windsurfing sail is {{tensioned}} at two points: at the tack (by downhaul), {{and at the}} clew (by <b>outhaul).</b> There {{is a set of}} pulleys for downhauling at the tack, and a grommet at the clew. Most {{shape is}} given to the sail by applying a very strong downhaul, which by design bends the mast. The <b>outhaul</b> tension is relatively weak, mostly providing leverage for controlling the sail's angle of attack.|$|E
5000|$|The rig {{may not be}} trimmed between {{start and}} finish by means other than sheet, downhaul, <b>outhaul,</b> traveller, mast {{rotation}} and halyards systems.|$|E
50|$|Mainsail {{controls}} {{permitted by}} the class are downhaul (Cunningham), <b>outhaul</b> and kicking strap (Vang). The Jib tack fixing {{may also be}} adjustable while sailing allowing changes in jib luff tension and tack height.|$|E
50|$|The boat has a 3:1 {{purchase}} downhaul (upgradable to 6:1) {{to tension}} the mainsail and an <b>outhaul</b> (standard 1:1, upgradable to 2:1) to flatten the mainsail along the boom. Both the mainsail and jib are fully battened.|$|E

50|$|The primary {{tool for}} {{adjusting}} mainsail shape is mast bend; a straight mast increases draft and lift; a curved mast decreases draft and lift—the backstay tensioner {{is a primary}} tool for bending the mast. Secondary tools for sail shape adjustment are the mainsheet, traveler, <b>outhaul,</b> and Cunningham.|$|E
50|$|Slab reefing, which {{involves}} lowering the sail by about one-quarter to {{one-third of its}} full length and tightening {{the lower part of}} the sail using an <b>outhaul</b> or a pre-loaded reef line through a cringle at the new clew, and hook through a cringle at the new tack.|$|E
50|$|The Force 5 has full sail controls, {{including}} a cunningham, <b>outhaul,</b> boom vang, and traveller. The mainsail has a sleeve which fits over the 3-piece aluminum mast. A junior sail is available with reduced sail area for better handling when used by lower weight individuals under 185 lbs. The rudder and centerboard are solid varnished mahogany but recently fiberglass versions became available.|$|E
50|$|The single sail of the Optimist is sprit-rigged. Two battens stiffen the leech. It is secured {{evenly with}} ties along the luff to the mast {{and along the}} foot to the boom, pulled down tightly by a vang/kicker. The light, slim third spar, the sprit, extends through a loop {{at the peak of}} the sail; the bottom rests in the eye of a short cable or string which hangs along the front edge of the mast. Raising and {{lowering}} the sprit and adjusting the boom vang allow for adaptation of sail trim to a range of wind conditions. Similarly, the Optimist has a small string <b>outhaul</b> on the end of the boom. It is usually correct to tighten the boomvang, <b>outhaul,</b> and sprit in heavy winds and loosen them in light winds. As well as this, huge adjustments can be made to sail shape, due to all of the ties running along the mast and boom.|$|E
50|$|An <b>outhaul</b> {{is a line}} {{which is}} part of the running rigging of a sailboat, used to extend a sail and control the shape of the curve of the foot of the sail. It runs from the clew (the back corner of the sail) to the end of the boom. The line is pulled taut to the {{appropriate}} tension to provide the desired shape to the foot and then secured to a cleat on the boom.|$|E
50|$|In most cases, rope is {{the term}} used only for raw material. Once a section of rope is {{designated}} for a particular purpose on a vessel, it generally is called a line, as in <b>outhaul</b> line or dock line. A very thick line is considered a cable. Lines that are attached to sails to control their shapes are called sheets, as in mainsheet. If a rope is made of wire, it maintains its rope name as in 'wire rope' halyard.|$|E
5000|$|The {{flexible}} mast {{allowed for}} flattening of sail in winds, with controls adjusted properly, like the Finn. The spruce boom is 10' in length, grooved for the bolt rope foot. Some early out haul designs had a metal bail attached aft end through which a wire <b>outhaul</b> ran, swagged {{to a wire}} and run to a cleat {{on the bottom of}} the boom near the main sheet block through a groove in the boom's and the tag runs to a cleat.|$|E
50|$|In the 1960s, {{a member}} of the New Canaan, Conn. Sunfish Fleet, John Black Lee, {{independently}} experimented with a conventional sail rig for the Sunfish. He developed a high-aspect ratio sail that worked on the Sunfish hull and christened his design the Formula S. The high aspect ratio sail plan has better upwind performance characteristics over the lateen sail, changing the boat's handling to point more like other Bermuda rig sailboats in its size. With this configuration, complexity of sail control is elevated by the addition of dynamic <b>outhaul,</b> downhaul, and mainsheet traveller lines.|$|E
5000|$|Sails are {{classified}} as [...] "triangular sails", [...] "quadrilateral fore-and-aft sails" [...] (gaff-rigged, etc.), and [...] "square sails". The top of a triangular sail, the head, is raised by a halyard, The forward lower corner of the sail, the tack, is shackled to a fixed point on the boat in a manner to allow pivoting about that point—either on a mast, e.g. for a mainsail, or on the deck, e.g. for a jib or staysail. The trailing lower corner, the clew, is positioned with an <b>outhaul</b> on a boom or directly with a sheet, absent a boom. Symmetrical sails have two clews, which may be adjusted forward or back.|$|E
50|$|The {{corners of}} {{triangular}} sails are typically areas of high stress and consequently often have reinforced layers and tape radiating from, whether cross-cut or radial in construction. Their corners are always {{attached to a}} shackle, attached to a line or spar—the halyard at the head, a shackle at the tack, and the <b>outhaul</b> at the clew. The connecting shackle runs through a grommet at each of these points. There are additional points where reinforcing and grommets may occur: at the cunningham, a downhaul used to flatten a mainsail (jibs may have a similar feature), and along {{the foot of a}} Genoa jib to allow a line to lift it out of the waves. The head of a triangular sail may have a rigid headboard riveted to it in order to transfer load from the sail to the halyard.|$|E
50|$|Running rigging is the cordage used {{to control}} the shape and {{position}} of the sails. Materials have evolved {{from the use of}} Manilla rope to synthetic fibers, which include dacron, nylon and kevlar. Running rigging varies between fore-and-aft rigged vessels and square-rigged vessels. They have common functions between them for supporting, shaping and orienting sails, which employ different mechanisms. For supporting sails, halyards (sometimes haulyards), are used to raise sails and control luff tension. On gaff-rigged vessels, topping lifts hold the yards {{across the top of the}} sail aloft. Sail shape is usually controlled by lines that pull at the corners of the sail, including the <b>outhaul</b> at the clew and the downhaul at the tack on fore-and-aft rigs. The orientation of sails to the wind is controlled primarily by sheets, but also by braces, which position the yard arms with respect to the wind on square-rigged vessels.|$|E
50|$|Servo motors sailboats are {{generally}} used {{to allow people}} with mobility problems to enjoy the freedom and independence of sailing by themselves, sailing solo, something that many don’t achieve in any other aspect of their lives. On two-person boats like the SKUD 18, the helmsperson may be a severely disabled sailor (SDS) so needs servo assisted steering, while the crew would generally control the sheets. But it is achievable {{to have a full}} servo system so that the SDS helmsperson can adjust sheets and other controls like the cunningham and <b>outhaul</b> as well. Access Sailing Systems servo assist equipment can easily be converted for manual use by disengaging the steering winch clutch and winding out all but a few inches of sheet and then hauling in the sheets by hand. On the SKUD 18, sheets are double ended and can be readily adjusted in either mode.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to compare the {{estimated}} production of the pendulum swing logging system to the production of a conventional balloon logging system. Cycle Time is established for the conventional system by time study techniques. A combination approach is used to model the pendulum system. A computer model simulates the mechanics of the inhaul and <b>outhaul</b> elements. The time study data from the conventional system is used to estimate the remainder of the cycle time for the pendulum system. Net payloads are calculated for both systems by a static analysis. The calculations show the pendulum system to be more productive when yarding distances are less than 1200 feet. The production calculations show the conventional system to be more productive when yarding distances exceed 1200 feet...|$|E
40|$|Most yacht sails {{are made}} of thin fabric, {{and they have a}} {{cambered}} shape to generate lift force; however, their shape can be easily deformed by wind pressure. Deformation of the sail shape changes the flow characteristics over the sail, which in turn further deforms the sail shape. Therefore, fluid-structure interaction (FSI) analysis is applied for the precise evaluation or optimization of the sail design. In this study, fluid flow analyses are performed for the main sail of a 30 -foot yacht, and the results are applied to loading conditions for structural analyses. By applying the supporting forces from the rig, such as the mast and boom-end <b>outhaul,</b> as boundary conditions for structural analysis, the deformed sail shape is identified. Both the flow analyses and the structural analyses are iteratively carried out for the deformed sail shape. A comparison of the flow characteristics and surface pressures over the deformed sail shape with those over the initial shape shows that a considerable difference exists between the two and that FSI analysis is suitable for application to sail design...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1975 Helicopter yarding {{systems have}} become a popular tool in {{removing}} timber from steep slopes, sensitive soils, limited access areas, and environmentally sensitive stands. Little {{is known about the}} system's dynamics. This study is part of a research project to explore "advanced" logging systems as to their economic efficiency and environmental applications. The objectives of my study were: 1 To identify and isolate variables that significantly influence helicopter yarding efficiency. 2 To develop a simulation model that will simulate the response of the helicopter yarding operations to changes in these variables. I observed a medium lift (Boeing-Vertol 107 Model II) helicopter operation yarding from old growth stands under varying conditions. The helicopter yarding cycle was broken down into four cycle elements and four delay elements. I used the method of continuous timing to observe these elements and obtain values for the variables that influence these elements. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to analyze the effect of these variables on time required to complete each cycle element. Regression equations were developed for two cycle element, <b>outhaul</b> and inhaul. Other cycle elements and delay elements were analyzed employing frequency distributions. A paired t-test was used to establish the reliability of the regression equations to precict element times. A FORTRAN simulation model was used to simulate the yarding system. The model can be used to estimate efficiency, production rates, and delay times {{for a wide range of}} yarding situations. I experimented with the finished model and, based on those results, made suggestions for system improvements...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Presentation date: 1983 - 04 - 28 Three skyline {{carriage}} {{types are}} analyzed {{on the basis}} of their operating characteristics and limitations. Their effect on productivity is expressed as cubic feet per hour yarded to the landing. These carriage types, tested as part of Oregon State University's School of Forestry Smallwood Harvesting Research Program represent those which are especially suited to thinning smallwood stands. The three types are distinguished by their clamping mechanisms: 1) skyline stop 2) self-clamping hydraulic and 3) self-clamping mechanical. The clamping mechanism is the means by which the carriage is secured to the skyline during the lateral inhaul element of the yarding cycle. Since data from the individual studies are not all comprehensive, five carriage studies are used for the analysis of the three carriage types. The Maki and Christy carriages represent the skyline stop carriages. The Koller 1. 0 and 2. 5 carriages represent the self-clamping hydraulic carriages and the Wyssen 2. 5 represents the self-clamping - mechanical carriages. The operating characteristics which proved to be most important are the ability to throw slack in the mainline, adaptability for use with sliding chokers, spotting ability and carriage delays. The skyline stop carriages tend to throw slack in the mainline when they hit the skyline stop at the end of <b>outhaul</b> (which aids in the lateral <b>outhaul</b> of the mainline). The Koller carriages, representing the self-clamping hydraulic carriages, cannot be used with sliding chokers without modification, since the load hook is part of the release mechanism. This effect, along with the effect of throwing slack, was not quantified. The Wyssen carriage was observed as having a greater capacity to be spotted at an exact location on the skyline for the lateral yarding sequence than any of the other carriages. This resulted in a lead angle standard deviation of only 17. 7 degrees. A similar standard deviation of 16 degrees was observed for the Koller 1. 0. The Christy carriage resulted in a larger standard deviation of 24 degrees. Lead angle data was not available for the Maki and Koller 2. 5 carriages. The importance of spotting is that either the logs can be yarded laterally to lead or the best extraction path can be choosen for a turn. Both of these advantages serve to reduce resets and minimize stand damage. Carriage delay analysis indicated very little difference between the time required to move the skyline stop calculated on a per turn basis and the time required for the self-clamping carriages to cycle every turn. With operational delays added in, the carriage delays for the skyline stop carriages is 0. 2678 minutes per turn and for the self-clamp mechanical is 0. 2625 minutes per turn. This information was not available for the self-clamping hydraulic carriages, but is probably greater than the self-clamping mechanical type and may be greater than the skyline stop type. The three carriage types were compared on a productivity basis. No conclusive differences were found since factors not accounted for in the individual studies tended to mask the affects of the different carriage types. The differences in productivity due to carriage types appear to be small in comparison to such factors as crew selection, stand conditions and site conditions...|$|E
40|$|The peat swamp {{forests of}} Sarawak are an {{important}} resource {{in the context of}} the socio-economic development of the state. Logging is the main activity in these forests. In the absence of an economical mechanized system, the method of harvesting has evolved into a highly organized effective manual system. Though the method itself is wellknown, there is still a dearth of quantitative data especially with respect to the mixed peat swamp forests of Sarawak. A timestudy was conducted in two forest reserves near Simunjan in the First Division of Sarawak. The primary objective was to quantify the logging system with special emphasi 5 on the skidding component. Other components that were studied include felling and bucking, skid track construction, debarking and loading. Both the one- and two-skid team crews were studied, with emphasis on the Abstract approved:, [...] -i. trv- I (iLz frLJ former. Both continuous timing and fi:ed interval activity sampling techniques were used. The skidding component was the key element controlling the overall production of the logging operation. It is comprised of five basic work elements, namely <b>outhaul,</b> load, sling, inhaul and unload. Load and inhaul were the largest work elements accounting for 30 percent or mcre of the basic cycle time. The basic cycle time ranged from 63 - 88 percent of the total cycle time depending upon the skidding potential of a crew. The skidding potential is a measure of a crew's aggressiveness. Skid distance and log weight were found to be significant variables accounting for more than 60 percent of the variation in cycle time. Crew aggressiveness and variability in skidding ctential could however counteract the effect of skid distance and log weight. The incidence of delays and their frequency may also be attributed to these factors. ience, skid distance, log weight and skidding potential of crews control the skidding productivity of the system. On the whole the logging operation in the I 1 ixed Peat Swamp Forest is a low-energy system of less than 13500 kilojoules per hour with an average productivity of 1. 42 m 3 per person day...|$|E
