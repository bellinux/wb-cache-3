5|$|Another {{important}} factor was the {{development in the}} late 18th and early 19th centuries <b>of</b> <b>museums</b> with large natural history collections. These museums received specimens from collectors {{around the world and}} served as centers for the study of comparative anatomy and morphology. These disciplines played key roles {{in the development of a}} more technically sophisticated form of natural history. One of the first and most important examples was the Museum of Natural History in Paris, which was at the center of many of the developments in natural history during the first decades of the 19th century. It was founded in 1793 by an act of the French National Assembly, and was based on an extensive royal collection plus the private collections of aristocrats confiscated during the French revolution, and expanded by material seized in French military conquests during the Napoleonic Wars. The Paris museum was the professional base for Cuvier, and his professional rival Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. The English anatomists Robert Grant and Richard Owen both spent time studying there. Owen would go on to become the leading British morphologist while working at the museum of the Royal College of Surgeons.|$|E
5|$|Dorset has {{a varied}} {{landscape}} featuring broad elevated chalk downs, steep limestone ridges and low-lying clay valleys. Over half {{the county is}} designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Three-quarters of its coastline {{is part of the}} Jurassic Coast Natural World Heritage Site due to its geological and palaeontologic significance. It features notable landforms such as Lulworth Cove, the Isle of Portland, Chesil Beach and Durdle Door. Agriculture was traditionally the major industry of Dorset but is now in decline and tourism has become increasingly important to the economy. There are no motorways in Dorset but a network of A roads cross the county and two railway main lines connect to London. Dorset has ports at Poole, Weymouth and Portland, and an international airport. The county has a variety <b>of</b> <b>museums,</b> theatres and festivals, and is host to one of Europe's largest outdoor shows. It is the birthplace of Thomas Hardy, who used the county as the principal setting of his novels, and William Barnes, whose poetry celebrates the ancient Dorset dialect.|$|E
5|$|In 2012 {{the museum}} was headed by Sujatmiko. That year David Kristian Budhiyanto of Petra Christian University wrote that {{the museum was}} rarely visited and in some places poorly maintained. He posited this {{to be based on}} a popular view <b>of</b> <b>museums</b> as unexciting or boring places. In order to attract new visitors, the museum has {{initiated}} several competitions in 2012 and 2013, including a photography contest on the museum's Facebook page. It has also undertaken mobile exhibitions, showing some of its collection in cities such as Yogyakarta and Magelang. Between January and September 2013 the museum received 26,249 visitors, an increase of 250 per cent over the previous year's target; this was credited to the various promotional efforts undertaken. The museum is now promoted as a site for educational tourism and accepts donations of materials related to the press in Indonesia.|$|E
