5|$|States that {{rejected}} the Medicaid expansion could maintain their Medicaid eligibility thresholds, which {{in many states}} were significantly below 133% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poverty</b> line. Many states did not make Medicaid available to childless adults at any income level. Because subsidies on exchange insurance plans were not available to those below the poverty line, such individuals had no new options. For example, in Kansas, where only able-bodied adults with children and with an income below 32% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poverty</b> line were eligible for Medicaid, those with incomes from 32% to 100% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poverty</b> level ($6,250 to $19,530 {{for a family of}} three) were ineligible for both Medicaid and federal subsidies to buy insurance. Absent children, able-bodied adults were not eligible for Medicaid in Kansas.|$|E
5|$|In 1884, the Settlement {{movement}} was founded, with settlements such as Toynbee Hall and Oxford House, to encourage university students {{to live and}} work in the slums, experience the conditions and try to alleviate some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poverty</b> and misery in the East End. Notable residents of Toynbee Hall included R. H. Tawney, Clement Attlee, Guglielmo Marconi, and William Beveridge. The Hall continues to exert considerable influence, with the Workers Educational Association (1903), Citizens Advice Bureau (1949) and Child Poverty Action Group (1965) all being founded or influenced by it. In 1888, the matchgirls of Bryant and May in Bow went on strike for better working conditions. This, combined with the many dock strikes in the same era, made the East End a key element in the foundation of modern socialist and trade union organisations, as well as the Suffragette movement.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poverty</b> {{the nation was}} {{enduring}} {{in the years immediately}} following World War I, many basic commodities became increasingly scarce and expensive to purchase, fueling an increase in crimes such as theft, assault and murder in addition to a significant increase in black market trading. Due to the peace treaty signed in 1919, Germany had no army, was forbidden to participate in the arms trade, and its police forcesâ€”badly paid and overstretchedâ€”had limited resources at their disposal. In this environment, police were welcoming of assistance and information from the public.|$|E

In 1573 he became guardian to the two sons of John William, duke of Saxe-Weimar, and in this capacity was able to add {{part of the county}} of Henneberg to the Electorate of Saxony. His command of money enabled him to take advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poverty</b> of his neighbours, and in this way he secured Vogtland and the county of Mansfeld. In 1555 he had appointed one of his nominees to the bishopric of Meissen, in 1561 he had secured the election of his son Alexander as bishop of Merseburg, and three years later as bishop of Naumburg; and when this prince died in 1565 these bishoprics came under the direct rule of Augustus.|$|E

In 1657 he advised his father not to accept the office of king, although in 1654 he had supported a motion to this effect; and after the dissolution of Cromwell's second parliament in February 1658 he showed his anxiety that the protector should act in a moderate and constitutional manner. After Oliver's death Henry hailed with delight the succession of his brother Richard to the office of protector, but although he was now appointed lieutenant and governor-general of Ireland, it was only with great reluctance that he remained in that country.|$|E
