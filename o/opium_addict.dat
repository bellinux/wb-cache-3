25|$|He {{moved to}} Capri, {{spending}} time there (at the Villa Daphne) and in London, {{and became a}} more committed writer. Nepenthe, the fictional island setting of South Wind, is Capri in light disguise. There he was friends with the eccentric community and <b>opium</b> <b>addict</b> Baron Jacques d'Adelswärd-Fersen. In 1912–1914 he worked for The English Review. He met D. H. Lawrence through this connection. This led to a feud, after Lawrence in his 1922 novel, Aaron's Rod based a character on Douglas. In late 1916 he jumped bail in London {{on a charge of}} indecent assault on a sixteen-year-old boy, and effectively then lived in exile. He himself wrote of this in self-exculpation: 'Norman Douglas of Capri, and of Naples and Florence, was formerly of England, which he fled during the war to avoid persecution for kissing a boy and giving him some cakes and a shilling'. (The boy in fact complained to the police).|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{determine}} the rate of stressful life events, the rate of perceived mental strain due to these stressors and various methods of coping with stress in <b>opium</b> <b>addicts</b> compared to normal subjects. Materials & Methods 137 male addicts and 140 normal subjects matched for sex, age and education participated in present study. The instruments used included Paykel Scale of Stressful Life Events for assessing life stressors and the rate of perceived mental strain due to these stressors, and Billings and Moos Coping Checklist for assessing the methods of coping. The data were analyzed using Mann-Whitney Test. ResultsThe findings of the study showed that first, over a two-year period the occurrence rate of stressors related to illness and death of relatives, family problems, legal problems, occupational problems and other personal problems in <b>opium</b> <b>addicts</b> was statistically higher than normal subjects. Second, compared to normal subjects, the rate of perceived mental strain due to stressors of illness and death of relatives, family problems, legal problems and occupational problems was statistically significant in <b>opium</b> <b>addicts.</b> Third, in comparison to normal subjects, the <b>opium</b> <b>addicts</b> made significantly more use of avoidance and emotional-focused coping while they made significantly less use of active-behavioral and problem-focused coping. ConclusionMore stressful life events, more perceived mental strain of these events, and more inappropriate and ineffective coping strategies in <b>opium</b> <b>addicts</b> may play a considerable role in their drug abuse tendency and their turning to relapse...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} an attempt to {{investigate}} the role of early maladaptive schemas and attachment styles in changeability of <b>opium</b> <b>addicts.</b> Method: The research method was descriptive-correlation and the number of 162 male <b>opium</b> <b>addicts</b> was selected via convenience sampling. For data collection purposes, Yang's early maladaptive schemas and Collins and Read’s adult attachment scale, and Rhode Island’s changeability scale were used. Results: The results showed that 38. 1 % of the changeability variance is predicted by secure attachment, avoidant attachment, and early maladaptive schemas. In the same way, avoidant and ambivalent attachment styles were positively associated with early maladaptive schemas. Conclusion: Due to the effect of early maladaptive schemas and insecure attachment styles on the incidence of maladaptive behavior, changeability of <b>opium</b> <b>addicts</b> can be expected to increase through the modification dysfunctional thoughts and systemic relations.  ...|$|R
2500|$|The Preface of [...] "Kubla Khan" [...] {{began by}} {{explaining}} {{that it was}} printed [...] "at the request of a poet of great and deserved celebrity, {{and as far as}} the author's own opinions are concerned, rather as a psychological curiosity, than on the ground of any supposed poetic merits". The preface then provided an origin to both the poem and why it was merely a smaller portion of an intended larger work. After reading from Purchas's book, [...] "The Author continued for about three hours in a profound sleep, at least of the external senses, during which time he had the most vivid confidence, that he could not have composed less than from two or three hundred lines ... On Awaking he appeared to himself to have a distinct recollection of the whole, and taking his pen, ink, and paper, instantly and eagerly wrote down the lines that are here preserved." [...] The image of himself that Coleridge provides is of a dreamer who reads works of lore and not as an <b>opium</b> <b>addict.</b> Instead, the effects of the opium, as described, are intended to suggest that he was not used to its effects.|$|E

40|$|Background: This {{study was}} done to test the notion that opium can reduce serum lipids and {{decrease}} the risk of ischemic heart disease (IHD) in opium addicts; we made a comparison between the lipid profiles of <b>opium</b> <b>addicts</b> and non-addicts. Methods: In this study, we compared 100 male <b>opium</b> <b>addicts</b> (according to the ICD- 10 criteria) who had referred to addiction treatment centers with 75 healthy male non-addicts. The subjects filled out our research questionnaire and had their fasting serum lipid profile (total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein, high density lipoprotein, and triglyceride) evaluated. Results: Among those with a body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 25, the total cholesterol level in the <b>opium</b> <b>addicts</b> was less than that in the control group; there was, however, no {{difference in terms of}} LDL, HDL, and TG between the case and control groups. There was a significant difference in BMI between the two groups, which requires further studies to investigate the reason. Conclusion: Opium {{does not seem to have}} any impact on triglyceride, low density lipoprotein, and high density lipoprotein. Despite the lower total cholesterol levels in <b>opium</b> <b>addicts</b> (as a known side effect of opium on different body systems), it is not advisable that opium and its extracts be recommended to decrease the risk of IHD...|$|R

40|$|Serum adiponectin and leptin {{levels have}} been shown to be related to obesity, insulin {{resistance}} and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Opium addiction has a positive association with endocrine system disorders. The relationship between adipokines and opium addiction is unclear. In the present study, we aimed to determine serum adiponectin and leptin levels in <b>opium</b> <b>addicted</b> subjects. Methods: 176 men, 88 <b>opium</b> <b>addicts</b> and 88 non-addicts were randomly selected from subjects who participated in Kerman Coronary Artery Disease Risk factors Study (KERCADRS); a population-based study. Serum adiponectin and leptin levels were measured using ELISA and compared between two groups. We adjusted the effect of some confounding factors such as the patients’ demographic, clinical and medical history in multivariate analysis model. Results: The serum level of adiponectin in <b>opium</b> <b>addicts</b> was significantly lower than control group (6. 5 ± 3. 6 vs. 9. 8 ± 8. 1 μg/ml, P< 0. 001). There was no significant difference in serum leptin level between two groups (11. 8 ± 10. 3 ng/ml in control group vs. 11. 5 ± 10. 8 ng/ml in <b>opium</b> <b>addicts,</b> p = 0. 80). In the multivariate analysis, after adjusting for age, cigarette smoking, body mass index, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cholesterol, triglyceride and high and low density lipoproteins, the negative association between opium addiction and decreased adiponectin level was still present (β = - 0. 144, P value = 0. 005). Conclusions: The results showed that opium addiction reduces serum adiponectin level. Since adiponectin has been shown to have anti-diabetic and anti-atherogenic effects, its reduction may account for increase in the risk of metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance and CVD amongst <b>opium</b> <b>addicted</b> patients...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} opium {{addiction}} on {{the appearance of}} different types of arrhythmias after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has been assessed in few studies. This study is aimed to determine the effect of opium on post-MI arrhythmia and also to address the differences in the appearance {{of different types of}} arrhythmias after AMI between <b>opium</b> <b>addicted</b> and non-addicted patients. In this comparative study, participants were classified into two groups with opium addiction (n= 94) and without opium addiction (n= 106). Post-MI arrhythmias were determined among each group. Study populations were included all patients with first AMI admitted within 6 hours of the onset of chest pain to coronary care units (CCU) of two teaching hospitals affiliated to Kerman University of Medical Sciences (KUMS) in the city of Kerman, Iran. <b>Opium</b> <b>addicted</b> subjects had significantly more frequency of arrhythmia than non-opium addicted subjects (80. 9 % vs. 22. 6 %, respectively; P< 0. 001). Opium addiction was a strong predictor for the occurrence of post-MI arrhythmias in two models of crude analysis (crude OR= 14. 4, P< 0. 001) and after adjusting for potential confounder factors (adjusted OR = 21. 9, P< 0. 001).
