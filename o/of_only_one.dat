5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata {{in seven}} movements, {{beginning with a}} chorale fantasia and ending in a closing chorale, as usually in his chorale cantatas, but with an unusual sequence <b>of</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> recitative and four arias, setting the poetic hymn stanzas. He scored it for three vocal soloists (soprano (S), tenor (T) and bass) (B), a four-part choir, and a Baroque chamber ensemble of corno da caccia (Co) to support the chorale tune in the outer movements, two flauti traversi (Ft), two oboes d'amore (Oa), two violins (Vl), two violas (Va) and basso continuo (Bc).|$|E

5|$|Balaenidae {{consists}} of two genera: Eubalaena (right whales) and Balaena (the bowhead whale, B. mysticetus). Balaenidae was thought to have consisted <b>of</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> genus until studies done through the early 2000s reported that bowhead whales and right whales are morphologically (different skull shape) and phylogenically different. According to a study done by H. C. Rosenbaum (of the American Museum of Natural History) and colleagues, the North Pacific (E. japonica) and Southern right (E. australis) whales are {{more closely related to}} each other than to the North Atlantic right whale (E. glacialis).|$|E
5|$|Edmund {{was born}} either in 1015, 1016 or 1017.

Although {{there is a possibility that}} Edmund was older than his brother, later known as Edward the Exile, it is also possible that they were twins. At the time, it was customary for posthumous sons to bear their father's name; thus, Edmund could have been the younger, posthumous son.|$|E
5|$|Finnegans Wake {{comprises}} seventeen chapters, {{divided into}} four Parts or Books. Part I contains eight chapters, Parts II and III each contain four, and Part IV consists <b>of</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> short chapter. The chapters appear without titles, and while Joyce never provided possible chapter titles {{as he had done}} for Ulysses, he did title various sections published separately (see Publication history below). The standard critical practice is to indicate part number in Roman numerals, and chapter title in Arabic, so that III.2, for example, indicates the second chapter of the third part.|$|E

5|$|The eyes of {{slow lorises}} are forward-facing, which gives stereo vision.

Slow lorises have monochromatic vision, meaning they see in shades <b>of</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> color.

5|$|The most {{successful}} reagents employed in a stoichiometric fashion are shown below.

The synthesis of the axial diastereomer is rationalized via the 1,3-anomeric effect which reduces the nucleophilicity of the equatorial lone pair. The conformation of the ylide is limited by transannular strain and approach of the aldehyde is limited to one face of the ylide by steric interactions with the methyl substituents.|$|E
