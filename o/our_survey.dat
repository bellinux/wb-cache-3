It is {{the largest and most}} impressive structure of Ani, and has been described by Armen Kazaryan as the most significant structure of the entire Bagratid period. The cathedral is known for its novel design features. Authors of Global History of Architecture wrote that it [...] "deserves to be listed among the principal monuments of the time because of its pointed arches and clustered columns and piers." [...] Josef Strzygowski argued that the cathedral is the most valuable achievement of Armenian architecture from the European viewpoint. David Marshall Lang wrote that the cathedral's building techniques are [...] "far ahead of the contemporary Anglo-Saxon and Norman architecture of western Europe." [...] H. F. B. Lynch wrote: [...] "The impression which we take away from <b>our</b> <b>survey</b> of these various features is that we have been introduced to a monument of the highest artistic merit, denoting a standard of culture which was far in advance of the contemporary standards in the West." [...] Sirarpie Der Nersessian wrote that it [...] "deserves to be listed among the important examples of medieval architecture." [...] The New International Encyclopedia characterized it as the [...] "most interesting church of Armenia." [...] David Roden Buxton suggested that the cathedral deserves far more fame than it actually has. Richard Phené Spiers wrote in the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition (1911): ...|$|E

40|$|Virginia and Yellow Rails {{are among}} the least studied birds in North America, {{and there is a}} {{specific}} lack of information about their autumn migration ecology and migratory habitat use. We conducted nocturnal surveys across 11 public wetlands in Missouri, USA from 2012 - 2016, and compared the timing of autumn migration from <b>our</b> <b>surveys</b> with three opportunistic datasets: 1) eBird records, 2) building strikes, and 3) state ornithological records. The observed timing (start and end date and duration) of Virginia Rail autumn migration varied between the opportunistic data and <b>our</b> <b>surveys.</b> Virginia Rail opportunistic data were bimodal, while <b>our</b> <b>surveys</b> had a single peak the second week in October. Yellow Rail autumn migration through Missouri peaked earlier in <b>our</b> <b>surveys</b> than opportunistic datasets which peaked during the second week in October. Both rails were found in moist soil habitats, however Virginia Rails selected perennial vegetation more than was available, while Yellow Rails selected annual plant species. Both species showed no selection for water depth and used shallow flooded wetlands. Understanding the autumn migration period and habitat requirements will allow wetland managers to better manage lands for autumn migrating Virginia and Yellow Rails...|$|R

"Previous Y-chromosome {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that Ashkenazi Levites, members of a paternally inherited Jewish priestly caste, display a distinctive founder event within R1a, the most prevalent Y-chromosome haplogroup in Eastern Europe. Here we report the analysis of 16 whole R1 sequences and show that a set of 19 unique nucleotide substitutions defines the Ashkenazi R1a lineage. While <b>our</b> <b>survey</b> of one of these, M582, in 2,834 R1a samples reveals its absence in 922 Eastern Europeans, we show it is present in all sampled R1a Ashkenazi Levites, as well as in 33.8% of other R1a Ashkenazi Jewish males and 5.9% of 303 R1a Near Eastern males, where it shows considerably higher diversity. Moreover, the M582 lineage also occurs at low frequencies in non-Ashkenazi Jewish populations. In contrast to the previously suggested Eastern European origin for Ashkenazi Levites, the current data are indicative of a geographic source of the Levite founder lineage in the Near East and its likely presence among pre-Diaspora Hebrews." ...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{epidemiological}} studies suggested that cpb 2 -positive Clostridium perfringens isolates {{are associated with}} gastrointestinal (GI) diseases in horses. These putative relationships, indicated by PCR genotyping, were tested {{in the present study}} by further genotyping and phenotyping of 23 cpb 2 -positive C. perfringens isolates from horses with GI disease (referred to hereafter as horse GI disease isolates). Our beta 2 -toxin (CPB 2) Western blot analyses demonstrated that all of the tested isolates were unable to produce detectable levels of CPB 2. However, Southern blot and nucleotide sequencing analyses identified intact cpb 2 open reading frames in all of <b>our</b> <b>surveyed</b> horse GI disease isolates. Furthermore, reverse transcriptase PCR and Northern blot analyses showed that cpb 2 genes in all of <b>our</b> <b>surveyed</b> horse GI disease isolates were transcriptionally active, i. e., an ∼ 1. 2 -kb cpb 2 -specific mRNA was identified in total RNA from <b>our</b> <b>surveyed</b> isolates. The levels of cpb 2 mRNA in CWC 245 (a high-CPB 2 -producing pig strain) and <b>our</b> <b>surveyed</b> horse GI disease isolates differed to such an extent (35 -fold) that this difference could be considered as a major cause of the difference in levels of CPB 2 production by CWC 245 and horse GI disease isolates. This finding received further support from our observation that the complementing strain 106902 (pMRS 140), which produced significantly higher levels of mRNA than strain 106902, produced high levels of CPB 2. Collectively, our results indicated that there is a positive correlation between cpb 2 transcription levels and the amount of CPB 2 produced by a C. perfringens cell and that decreased transcription and/or message instability may be involved, at least in part, in the low CPB 2 production noted for horse GI disease isolates in comparison to that noted for pig GI disease isolate CWC 245...|$|R
2500|$|By {{the end of}} March, {{veterinary}} organizations {{reported more}} than 100 pet deaths amongst nearly 500 cases of kidney failure, and experts expected the death toll to number in the thousands, with one online database already self-reporting as many as 3,600 deaths as of 11 April. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has received reports of approximately 8500 animal deaths, including at least 1950 cats and 2200 dogs who have died after eating contaminated food, but have only confirmed 14 cases, in part {{because there is no}} centralized government database of animal sickness or death in the United States as there are with humans (such as the Centers for Disease Control). For this reason, many sources speculate {{the full extent of the}} pet deaths and sicknesses caused by the contamination may never be known. In October, the results of the [...] "AAVLD survey of pet food-induced nephrotoxicity in North America, April to June 2007," [...] were reported, indicating 347 of 486 cases voluntarily reported by 6 June 2007 had met the diagnostic criteria, with most of the cases reported from the United States, but also including cases of 20 dogs and 7 cats reported from Canada.The cases involved 235 cats and 112 dogs, with 61 percent of the cats and 74 percent of the dogs having died. Dr. Barbara Powers, AAVLD president and director of the Colorado State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, said the survey probably found only a percentage of the actual cases. She also said the mortality rate is not likely to be representative of all cases, because survey respondents had more information to submit for animals that had died. A number of dogs were also reported affected in Australia, with four in Melbourne and a few more in Sydney. No legal action or repercussions have as yet occurred regarding these cases. Dr. Powers elaborated further: “But there absolutely could be more deaths from the tainted pet food.... This survey didn’t catch all the deaths that happened. In order to be counted in <b>our</b> <b>survey,</b> you had to meet certain criteria.... If someone had a pet that died and they buried it in their back, they weren’t eligible for <b>our</b> <b>survey.</b> We had to have confirmed exposure to the recalled pet food, proof of toxicity, and clinical signs of renal failure. So this is only a percentage of the deaths that are out there. There’s no way to guess how many pets were affected.” ...|$|E

Just as every species by its natural rate of reproduction would soon completely fill any country it could live in, but does not, being checked by some other species or some other condition--so it may be surmised that variation and natural selection have their struggle and consequent check, or are limited by something inherent in the constitution of organic beings.|$|E

Professor Westwood admits the fact of the mimicry and its probable use to the insect, but maintains that each species was created a mimic for the purpose of the protection thus afforded it. Mr. Andrew Murray, in his paper on the [...] "Disguises of Nature," [...] inclines to the opinion that similar conditions of food and of surrounding circumstances have acted in some unknown way to produce the resemblances; and when the subject was discussed before the Entomological Society of London, a third objection was added--that heredity or the reversion to ancestral types of form and colouration, might have produced many of the cases of mimicry.|$|E
