In particular, a relation between maximal and minimal extensions of regular norm on a C ∗-algebra is established. Key words and phrases: W ∗-algebras, C ∗-algebras, Self-adjoint elements (operators), Maximal and minimal extensions <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> <b>norm,</b> Furuta type inequalities. 2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 46 H 05, 46 J 10, 47 A 50. Let H be a Hilbert space and B(H) be the algebra of all bounded linear operators on H. A subset of B(H) is a W ∗-algebra on H if X is a C ∗-algebra which is closed in the weak operator topology, see [1]. Also, a W ∗-algebra is a C ∗-subalgebra of B(H) which is weakly closed. In particular, a W ∗-algebra is an algebra of operators. We note that a C ∗-algebra acting on H is commutative {{if and only if}} zero is the only nilpotent element of the algebra. Let X be a W ∗-algebra and XSA be the set of self-adjoint elements of X, that is if T ∈ S (X) = ⇒ T = T ∗, where T ∗ is the adjoint of T. Here we prove the following theorem. Theorem 1. A unital W ∗-algebra X of operators is noncommutative if ∀A, B ∈ XSA, ‖A ‖ = 1 = ‖B ‖ = ⇒ ‖A + B ‖> 1 + ‖AB ‖. Proof. Since X is noncommutative, there exists an operator T in X such that T 2 = 0. Suppose X 1 is the range of T and X 2 is the orthogonal complement of X 1. Then H = X 1 ⊕ X 2. Let...|$|E

This includes Schur multipliers, Fourier multipliers on some unimodular locally compact groups which can be approximated by discrete groups in various senses. On the other hand, we show the existence of bounded Fourier multipliers which cannot be approximated by regular operators, on large classes of locally compact groups, including all infinite abelian locally compact groups. We finish by introducing a general procedure for proving positive results on selfadjoint contractively decomposable Fourier multipliers, beyond the amenable case.

40|$|AbstractThe {{concept of}} the <b>regular</b> (or Riesz) <b>norm</b> on ordered real Banach spaces is {{generalized}} to matrix ordered complex operator spaces {{in a way that}} respects the matricial structure of the operator space. A norm on an ordered real Banach spaceEis regular if: (1) −x⩽y⩽ximplies that ‖y‖⩽‖x‖; and (2) ‖y‖< 1 implies the existence ofx∈Esuch that ‖x‖< 1 and −x⩽y⩽x. A matrix ordered operator space is called matrix regular if, at each matrix level, the restriction of the norm to the self-adjoint elements is <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> <b>norm.</b> In such <b>a</b> space, elements at each matrix level can be written as linear combinations of four positive elements. The {{concept of the}} matrix ordered operator space is made specific {{in such a way as}} to be <b>a</b> natural generalization <b>of</b> ordered real and complex Banach spaces. For the case whereVis a matrix ordered operator space, a natural cone is defined on the operator spaceX*⊗hV⊗hX, with ⊗hindicating the Haagerup tensor product, so as to make it a matrix ordered operator space. Exploiting the advantages gained by takingXto be the column Hilbert spaceHc, an equivalence is established between the matrix regularity <b>of</b> <b>a</b> space and that of its operator dual. This concept of matrix regularity also provides for more accessible proofs of the Christensen–Sinclair Multilinear Representation and Multilinear Decomposition theorems...|$|R
