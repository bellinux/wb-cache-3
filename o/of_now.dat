5|$|Although the {{suffrage}} {{movement in}} Wales attempted {{to show a}} level of independence, it was always following rather than leading a national agenda. It depended deeply in its embryonic years on celebrated suffragists from outside its borders to bring crowds to town meetings, but still relied on a network <b>of</b> <b>now</b> forgotten non-militant supporters who organised and campaigned on the ground level. And, although failing to significantly draw a rural Welsh-speaking heartland to its cause, it still embraced a national sense of pride and values that contrasted to their neighbours in England.|$|E

They staged a protest in 1970 at the Second Congress to Unite Women, and earned the support of many NOW members, finally gaining full acceptance in 1971.|$|E

Uzbekistan began its integration process when Russia announced it would write off USD$865 million off debt owed by the country. Uzbekistan joined the CIS Free Trade Area in 2014, meaning it has free trade with EEU member states.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{original}} routing {{of what is now}} I-84 existed as early as 1923; however the portion <b>of</b> <b>now</b> I-84 into Idaho was not yet constructed. In 1926, much of the route was signed as US-30S, from the now eastern terminus at I-80 (US-530 then), northwest into Ogden. Between Ogden and Brigham City, the highway was to be concurrent with US-91, then US-30S split off northwest to the Idaho border. The entire western branch of US-30S was an unimproved road, however the concurrency into Ogden was paved. The remainder of the route to its now terminus was mostly graded with a few improved sections, and by 1937, the entire route was paved.|$|E
5|$|Passage of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 {{formed the}} Interstate Highway System, however only the western segment <b>of</b> <b>now</b> I-84 was {{approved}} at this time, and a designation of I-82S {{was assigned to}} a then unconstructed controlled-access highway across Box Elder County in 1957. The eastern segment of the highway was added later in 1957, and the route was numbered I-80N by 1958. By 1968, portions of the western half of the freeway had been completed, along with the segment between Tremonton and Brigham City. A portion of the freeway was completed around Morgan as well. By 1971, most of the western portions of the freeway had been constructed with two sections remaining that had at-grade intersections. Along the concurrency, there were gaps between Brigham City and Pleasant View, and one small gap near the Devil's Slide.|$|E
5|$|Risks to {{internal}} security: According to Czech Ministry of Interior, the main {{danger of the}} proposal rested in massive transfer <b>of</b> <b>now</b> legal firearms into illegality, with up {{to hundreds of thousands}} of legal firearms entering black market. While the original Commission proposal would affect 40,000 – 50,000 firearms legally possessed by Czech citizens, Dutch EU Council Presidency proposal of 4 April 2016 would affect some 400,000 legally owned firearms, i.e. making half of all Czech legally owned firearms illegal with large proportion of gun owners likely refusing to surrender their firearms. The proposal as such is in direct contradiction with Ministry’s long-term objective of lowering of number of illegal firearms and of conducting effective supervision of firearm owners.|$|E

5|$|With {{the arrival}} of Cornwallis and more {{reinforcements}} from New York, the British Army numbered 7,200 men. Cornwallis wanted to push Lafayette, whose force now numbered 3,000 men with {{the arrival of}} Virginia militia. On May 24, he set out after Lafayette, who withdrew from Richmond, and linked forces with those under the command of Baron von Steuben and Anthony Wayne. Cornwallis did not pursue Lafayette. Instead, he sent raiders into central Virginia, where they attacked depots and supply convoys, before being recalled on June 20. Cornwallis then headed for Williamsburg, and Lafayette's force <b>of</b> <b>now</b> 4,500 followed him. General Clinton, in a confusing series of orders, ordered Cornwallis first to Portsmouth and then Yorktown, where he was instructed to build fortifications for a deep water port.|$|E
