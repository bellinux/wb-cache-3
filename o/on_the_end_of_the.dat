5|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature of}} the new command centre was a large liquid crystal display which displayed information regarding the air conditioning unit and sound system. Buyers could opt for a premium sound package, standard on the Fairmont Ghia, which included a full-colour screen. Ventilation outlets were larger than those of previous models, resulting in a cabin that could be more effectively and efficiently heated or cooled. Another change was the headlamp switch, which was now located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> turn signal stalk for easier reach.|$|E

The record featured the early gathering of 'First Call' musician's including Ray Pohlman, Al Casey, Earl Palmer, etc. backing up their youngest member of the group. Glen Campbell volunteered to be the voice of 'The Dragon' <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> record and the interplay between Glen and Bill was hilarious.|$|E

5|$|The line {{judge is}} {{positioned}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line of scrimmage, opposite the head linesman. He or she supervises player substitutions, {{the line of}} scrimmage during punts, and game timing. He notifies the referee when time has expired {{at the end of a}} quarter and notifies the head coach of the home team when five minutes remain for halftime. In the NFL, the line judge also alerts the referee when two minutes remain in the half. If the clock malfunctions or becomes inoperable, the line judge becomes the official timekeeper.|$|E
5|$|Artillery {{powered by}} {{gunpowder}} {{was introduced to}} Europe in the 1320s and spread quickly. Handguns, which were initially unpredictable and inaccurate weapons, were not recorded until the 1380s. Castles were adapted to allow small artillery pieces– averaging between – to fire from towers. These guns were too heavy {{for a man to}} carry and fire, but if he supported the butt end and rested the muzzle {{on the edge of the}} gun port he could fire the weapon. The gun ports developed in this period show a unique feature, that of a horizontal timber across the opening. A hook <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gun could be latched over the timber so the gunner did not have to take the full recoil of the weapon. This adaptation is found across Europe, and although the timber rarely survives, there is an intact example at Castle Doornenburg in the Netherlands. Gunports were keyhole shaped, with a circular hole at the bottom for the weapon and a narrow slit on top to allow the gunner to aim.|$|E
5|$|By the 1880s and 1890s, {{both the}} power of naval {{artillery}} and the speed of warships had further increased, leading to further investment in the castle between 1888 and 1893. The keep's magazine, which could hold up to 2,250 shells, was reinforced with concrete and the south bastion of the old castle was filled in with shingle and concrete for additional protection. New 6-pounder (2.7kg) quick-firing guns were installed in a battery <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> east wing, supported by machine guns, {{to enable them to}} target fast moving vessels, particularly the new torpedo boats. Further emplacements for 12-pounder (5.4kg) guns followed, including one {{on the top of the}} keep.|$|E

5|$|GMAW with {{globular}} {{metal transfer}} {{is considered the}} least desirable {{of the three major}} GMAW variations, because of its tendency to produce high heat, a poor weld surface, and spatter. The method was originally developed as a cost efficient way to weld steel using GMAW, because this variation uses carbon dioxide, a less expensive shielding gas than argon. Adding to its economic advantage was its high deposition rate, allowing welding speeds of up to 110mm/s (250in/min). As the weld is made, a ball of molten metal from the electrode tends to build up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electrode, often in irregular shapes with a larger diameter than the electrode itself. When the droplet finally detaches either by gravity or short circuiting, it falls to the workpiece, leaving an uneven surface and often causing spatter. As a result of the large molten droplet, the process is generally limited to flat and horizontal welding positions, requires thicker workpieces, and results in a larger weld pool.|$|E
5|$|Inocybe maculata has {{thin-walled}} cheilocystidia, {{which are}} clavate (club-shaped), lack encrustation at the apex, and are colourless. The basidia are also clavate, {{and can be}} two-, three- or four-spored, and measure from 15 to 30 micrometres (μm) by 5 to 9μm. The sterigmata (the narrow horns <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> basidia which hold the spores) are 4 to 5μm long. It lacks pleurocystidia. The species leaves a snuff-brown spore print. The spores themselves are smooth and bean shaped; they have a yellow-brown to rusty brown colouration, and measure from 9 to 11μm by 4.5 to 5.5μm. The hyphae can have clamp connections, but can also lack them.|$|E
5|$|Non-black belts, {{from white}} through to brown, denote the kup ranks.

Black belts denote the dan ranks. A specific dan rank {{is represented by the}} number of white bars embroidered on the black belt. A black belt with no bars is a Junior Black Belt, a rank assigned to members considered too young (typically 15 years or younger) for 1st dan. Junior Black Belt members are tested for 1st dan when they reach 18 years of age. One bar denotes 1st dan, two bars denote 2nd dan, and so <b>on.</b> <b>The</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> belt bearing the dan rank also carries embroidery noting the name of the master issuing the promotion (Chong Chul Rhee, Chong Hyup Rhee, or Chong Yoon Rhee).|$|E

25|$|A mega-{{telomere}} (also {{known as}} an ultra-long telomere or a class III telomere), is an extremely long telomere sequence that sits <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> chromosomes and prevents the loss of genetic information during cell replication. Like regular telomeres, mega-telomeres are made of a repetitive sequence of DNA and associated proteins, and are located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> chromosomes. However, mega-telomeres are substantially longer than regular telomeres, {{ranging in size from}} 50 kilobases to several megabases (for comparison, the normal length of vertebrate telomeres is usually between 10 and 20 kilobases).|$|R
5|$|On 30 October 1914, the {{hospital}} ship Rohilla was sunk, hitting the rocks {{within sight of}} shore just off Whitby at Saltwick Bay. Of the 229 people on board, 85 {{lost their lives in}} the disaster; most are buried in the churchyard at Whitby. In a raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby in December 1914, the town was shelled by the German battlecruisers Von der Tann and Derfflinger. In the final assault on the Yorkshire coast the ships aimed their guns at the signal post <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> headland.

5|$|The multisegmented legs end {{in two to}} five small {{segments}} called tarsi. Like {{many other}} insect orders, beetles have claws, usually one pair, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last tarsal segment of each leg. While most beetles use their legs for walking, legs have been variously adapted for other uses. Aquatic beetles including the Dytiscidae (diving beetles), Haliplidae, and many species of Hydrophilidae, the legs, often the last pair, are modified for swimming, typically with rows of long hairs. Male diving beetles have suctorial cups on their forelegs that they use to grasp females. Other beetles have fossorial legs widened and often spined for digging. Species with such adaptations are found among the scarabs, ground beetles, and clown beetles (Histeridae). The hind legs of some beetles, such as flea beetles (within Chrysomelidae) and flea weevils (within Curculionidae), have enlarged femurs that help them leap.|$|E

5|$|Within {{a week of}} Disneyland's {{opening on}} July 17, 1955, a {{brakeman}} pulled the switch connecting the Disneyland Railroad's main line with a siding at Main Street, U.S.A. Station too soon as the Retlaw 2 freight train on the siding was passing the Retlaw 1 passenger train stopped at the station on the main line. The caboose <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> freight train had not made it fully across the switch when it was pulled, {{and as a result}} the caboose's front set of wheels correctly traveled along the siding while the rear set of wheels incorrectly traveled along the main line towards the passenger train, causing the caboose to swing to the side before colliding with a concrete slab and derailing upon impact. During the ensuing commotion, the erring brakeman, presumably to avoid disciplinary action, quietly left the scene of the accident, exited the park, and was not seen again. No injuries were reported, and by the following year the use of sidings at stations on the DRR's main line came to an end.|$|E
