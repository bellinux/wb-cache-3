5|$|As {{a show of}} {{communist}} rule and Soviet domination, sixteen prominent leaders of the Polish anti-Nazi underground were brought to trial in Moscow in June 1945.

The trial of the defendants, falsely and absurdly accused of collaboration with the Nazis, was watched by British and American diplomats without protest. The absence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>expected</b> death sentences was their relief.

That night the Germans attacked again, this time targeting CTroop, but were again driven back. Shortly thereafter a group from No. 45 (Royal Marine) Commando arrived and reported that the Germans had broken through and were on the road behind No. 4 Commando. Captain Porteous and DTroop moved down the road to deal with them. Outnumbered two to one DTroop charged, killing some and forcing the rest to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|Cuban {{government}} officials issued a hurricane {{watch for the}} southern coastline on August 11, {{two days before the}} hurricane struck the island.

An additional 3,800residents were evacuated from offshore islands, while 47,000 in Havana were transported from old, unsafe buildings to safer areas. The people were transported to shelters provisioned with supplies. In addition, the power grid in southern Cuba was turned off to avoid accidents.|$|E
5|$|Forecasters at the JTWC {{initially}} projected {{the storm}} to track north of Taiwan on September12 and merge with an approaching frontal system. Contrary to this, Sarah moved south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>expected</b> path and quickly weakened as it interacted with the mountainous terrain of Taiwan. The storm eventually struck the island with winds of 165km/h (105mph) late on September11. Unexpectedly, the typhoon executed a counterclockwise loop and briefly moved offshore {{before making a}} second landfall 12hours later along the northeastern coast of Taiwan as a tropical storm. Sarah failed to reorganize as it moved over the Taiwan Strait and later made its final landfall in Zhejiang, China as a minimal tropical storm on September13. The storm was last noted the following day as dissipating over Eastern China.|$|E
40|$|In {{this report}} {{the design and}} first test results are {{presented}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>EXPECT</b> groundwater module for transport of solutes GRRR (GRoundwater source Receptor Relationships). This model is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abiotic compartment modules <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>EXPECT</b> model. <b>The</b> <b>EXPECT</b> model is a tool for scenario development of environmental policy plans. It covers <b>the</b> pathway <b>of</b> environmental pollutants from emissions to effects on biotic and abiotic receptor systems. The GRRR model computes <b>the</b> transport <b>of</b> solutes in <b>the</b> groundwater compartment by means of source-receptor relationships. These relationships are derived with the National Groundwater Model (LGM) developed at LBG, RIVM. This approach results in a fast calculating model which produces results in an aggregated format. Example results illustrate the way the model works. Based on three fictious scenarios, nitrogen contents have been computed in shallow and deep groundwater layers. The conclusion was made that the model is suited to perform scenario analyses, but for extreme scenarios or for detailled calculations a research model like LGM is better suited. ...|$|R

In Alto Paraíso de Goiás, the hotels also made specific reservations for prophetic dates. On 11 October 2012, in the Brazilian city of Teresina, police interrupted what was believed to have been an attempted mass suicide by up to one hundred members of a cult headed by self-proclaimed prophet Luis Pereira dos Santos, who predicted the end of the world on the feast day of Our Lady of Aparecida.

5|$|Second ending: Charles and Sarah have a rash sexual {{encounter}} in which Charles realises that Sarah was a virgin. Reflecting on his emotions during this, Charles ends his engagement to Ernestina, and proposes to Sarah through a letter. Charles's servant Sam fails {{to deliver the}} letter and, after Charles breaks his engagement, Ernestina's father disgraces him. His uncle marries and his wife bears an heir, ensuring the loss <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>expected</b> inheritance. To escape the social suicide and depression caused by his broken engagement, Charles goes abroad to Europe and America. Ignorant of Charles' proposal, Sarah flees to London without telling her lover. During Charles' trips abroad, his lawyer searches for Sarah, finding her two years later living in the Chelsea house of the painter and poet Dante Gabriel Rossetti, where she enjoys an artistic, creative life. Sarah shows Charles the child of their affair, leaving him in hope that the three may be reunited.|$|E

5|$|The Mycenaean economy, {{given its}} pre-monetary nature, {{was focused on}} the {{redistribution}} of goods, commodities and labor by a central administration. The preserved Linear B records in Pylos and Knossos indicate that the palaces were closely monitoring a variety of industries and commodities, the organization of land management and the rations given to the dependent personnel. The Mycenaean palaces maintained extensive control of the nondomestic areas of production through careful control and acquisition and distribution in the palace industries, and the tallying of produced goods. For instance, the Knossos tablets record c. 80,000-100,000 sheep grazing in central Crete, and the quantity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>expected</b> wool from these sheep and their offspring, as well as how this wool was allocated. The archives of Pylos display a specialized workforce, where each worker belonged to a precise category and was assigned to a specific task in the stages of production, notably in textiles.|$|E
5|$|The closed-shell {{electron}} configuration of flerovium {{results in the}} metallic bonding in metallic flerovium being weaker than in the preceding and following elements; thus, flerovium {{is expected to have}} a low boiling point, and has recently been suggested to be possibly a gaseous metal, similar to the predictions for copernicium, which also has a closed-shell {{electron configuration}}. The melting and boiling points of flerovium were predicted in the 1970s to be around 70°C and 150°C, significantly lower than the values for the lighter group 14 elements (those of lead are 327°C and 1749°C respectively), and continuing the trend of decreasing boiling points down the group. Although earlier studies predicted a boiling point of ~1000°C or 2840°C, this is now considered unlikely because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>expected</b> weak metallic bonding in flerovium and that group trends would expect flerovium to have a low sublimation enthalpy. Recent experimental indications have suggested that the pseudo-closed shell configuration of flerovium results in very weak metallic bonding and hence that flerovium is probably a gas at room temperature with a boiling point of around −60°C.|$|E
