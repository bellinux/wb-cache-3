5|$|Kim {{participated in}} a battle royal on October 19 at Taboo Tuesday, which was won by Stratus. Kim, however, was {{released}} by WWE on November 3, 2004 {{as a result of}} cost cutting. Kim was caught <b>off</b> <b>guard</b> by her release and was told that management wanted to take the women's division in a new direction.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the final}} four, McGary stated {{that he would not}} enter the 2013 NBA Draft, but a few days later said he had been caught <b>off</b> <b>guard</b> and would prefer to respond after he had time to reflect on his season.|$|E
5|$|Having assumed this {{formation}} {{upon the}} giving of a prearranged signal, the Allied ships moved suddenly outwards from this position {{at a second}} signal, rowing into the Persian ships and catching them <b>off</b> <b>guard.</b> Their superior seamanship negated, the Persians came off worst from the encounter with 30 of their ships captured or sunk. During the battle a Greek ship, captained by Antidorus of Lemnos, defected to the Allies. Nightfall then ended the battle, with the Allies having fared better than they possibly expected to.|$|E

5|$|In the {{clashes with}} the Normans through the 1080s, the only {{effective}} Byzantine naval force was a squadron commanded, and possibly maintained, by Michael Maurex, a veteran naval commander of previous decades. Together with the Venetians, he initially prevailed over the Norman fleet, but the joint fleet was caught <b>off</b> <b>guard</b> and {{defeated by the}} Normans off Corfu in 1084.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of December, under bad weather conditions, the Nazis {{launched}} an offensive in the Ardennes. The Luftwaffe caught many squadrons <b>off</b> <b>guard.</b> No.410 Squadron enjoyed a number of successes during this period, some of them even on Christmas Day. During the Battle of the Bulge, the entire RAF Second Tactical Air Force, including No.410 Squadron, was on 48-hour alert.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack of}} Alexios's {{division}} initially caught Bryennios's men <b>off</b> <b>guard,</b> but, being veteran troops, they soon recovered {{and once again}} began to push it back. Retreating, Alexios's troops, and especially the Turks, employed skirmishing tactics, attacking the enemy line and then withdrawing swiftly, thus keeping their opponents at bay and weakening the coherence of their line. Some among Alexios's men chose to attack Bryennios, and the rebel general had to defend against several attacks himself.|$|E
60|$|Lisle {{was curious}} {{and had no}} diffidence about putting the question, though the lad was {{obviously}} <b>off</b> his <b>guard.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{incident}} {{involved the}} accidental triggering {{of a fire}} extinguishing system which sealed two forward compartments and released Halon 2402 (freon R-114B2), dibromotetrafluoroethane gas into them. According to survivors, those affected by the gas release were caught <b>off</b> <b>guard</b> and {{may not have been}} alerted in time due to warning sirens sounding only after the gas had already begun pouring in. Some of the victims were reported to have been unable to turn on breathing kits before they suffocated.|$|E
5|$|When the BoM first classiifed Lam as Tropical Low 13U, {{the agency}} also issued a cyclone {{watch for the}} Cape York Peninsula and Arnhem Land. Before the storm struck, {{officials}} transported residents in Lam's path by air to the capital city Darwin. All 426people living in Warruwi were airlifted, and the storm caused many schools {{in the region to}} be closed; students from Warruwi continued classes after they evacuated to Darwin. Residents anticipated Lam's intensity to be lower at landfall, which left some <b>off</b> <b>guard.</b>|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} Khalid's {{strategic}} maneuverability was his advance into Roman Syria. Emperor Heraclius had sent all his available garrisoned troops into Syria, towards Ajnadayn, {{to hold the}} Muslim troops at the Syria-Arabia border region. The possible route of any Muslim reinforcement {{was expected to be}} the conventional Syria-Arabia road in the south, but Khalid, who was then in Iraq, took the most unexpected route: marching through the waterless Syrian desert, to the surprise of the Byzantines, he appeared in northern Syria. Catching the Byzantines <b>off</b> <b>guard,</b> he quickly captured several towns, virtually cutting off the communications of the Byzantine army at Ajnadayn with its high command at Emesa, where emperor Heraclius himself resided.|$|E
60|$|Capt. H. (<b>Off</b> his <b>guard,</b> nervous). Yes. My only boy Harry. He's {{coming home}} to-morrow. (Mumbles.) For a {{permanent}} stay.|$|R

5|$|Early in its life, forecasters had {{difficulties}} {{regarding the}} future track {{and intensity of}} Danielle, including a northeastward motion instead of its loop. After Danielle executed its loop, forecasters consistently predicted a landfall along the northeastern North Carolina coastline. As a result, officials issued Tropical Storm Warnings for the coast of North Carolina on September 24, 36hours before the storm passed {{to the east of}} the state. The continued northward motion caught forecasters <b>off</b> <b>guard,</b> and consequentially tropical storm warnings were not issued for the Delmarva Peninsula until just 12hours before the storm made landfall. In addition, forecasters issued tropical storm warnings from Delaware through Watch Hill, Rhode Island, as a precaution.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, several {{ships were}} caught <b>off</b> <b>guard</b> {{by the late}} arrival of Jeanne. The cyclone entered the Gulf of Mexico, and two barges broke loose from towing vessels via strong winds and high waves. One barge was an oil rig tender that {{contained}} 16people; it was carried several hundred miles across the central Gulf of Mexico. All crew members survived, {{and there were no}} maritime deaths related to the hurricane. Jeanne produced a prolonged period of rough surf and heavy swells along the Texas coast. Tides reached 2 to 4feet (1.20m) above normal. The hurricane caused coastal flooding; the worst flooding occurred near Galveston.|$|E
5|$|Hermesâ€“ The former God of Speed and Commerce, the Messenger of the Gods, and {{the father}} of Ceryx. Hermes participated in the Olympian wager in the God of War comic series by {{choosing}} Danaus to be his champion. In God of War III, Hermes taunted Kratos about murdering his family during Kratos' assault on Mount Olympus, leading to a chase through the city of Olympia. Kratos eventually caught Hermes <b>off</b> <b>guard,</b> killed him, which released a plague on the world, and took his boots, the Boots of Hermes, as his own. The character was voiced by Greg Ellis in God of War III.|$|E
6000|$|Bigfoot, who had {{recovered}} from his blow and {{escaped from the}} ranch, made a sudden dash at Dick when he thought him <b>off</b> his <b>guard,</b> but Dick was not easily caught <b>off</b> his <b>guard</b> in a fight. While {{in the act of}} making a furious demonstration at an Indian in front, which kept that savage off, he gave Bigfoot a [...] "back-handed wipe," [...] as he called it, which tumbled the chief completely off his horse.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good! Good!" [...] whispered Lingard, excitedly, <b>off</b> his <b>guard</b> for once. Then--"How {{the devil}} {{do you know}} {{anything}} about it?" [...] he asked.|$|R
60|$|Sylvia had not {{expected}} this and she was <b>off</b> her <b>guard.</b> She started, and sat looking at Ethel incredulously, with something like consternation.|$|R
5|$|In 1950, the Korean War broke out, {{prompting}} the United States {{to intervene in}} the name of the United Nations. President Truman was caught <b>off</b> <b>guard</b> when the invasion struck, but quickly ordered U.S. forces stationed in Japan into South Korea. Truman also sent U.S.-based troops, tanks, fighter and bomber aircraft, and a strong naval force to Korea to support the Republic of Korea. As part of the naval mobilization Missouri was called up from the Atlantic Fleet and dispatched from Norfolk on 19 August to support UN forces on the Korean peninsula.|$|E
5|$|In 533, Belisarius {{sailed to}} Africa with {{a fleet of}} 92 dromons, escorting 500 {{transports}} carrying an army of about 15,000 men, {{as well as a}} number of barbarian troops. They landed at Caput Vada (modern Ras Kaboudia) in modern Tunisia. They defeated the Vandals, who were caught completely <b>off</b> <b>guard,</b> at Ad Decimum on 14 September 533 and Tricamarum in December; Belisarius took Carthage. King Gelimer fled to Mount Pappua in Numidia, but surrendered the next spring. He was taken to Constantinople, where he was paraded in a triumph. Sardinia and Corsica, the Balearic Islands, and the stronghold Septem Fratres near Gibraltar were recovered in the same campaign.|$|E
5|$|In June 1941, Nazi Germany {{invaded the}} Soviet Union. Unlike {{many of the}} border troops who were caught <b>off</b> <b>guard</b> by the offensive, Bagramyan and his commander, General Mikhail Kirponos, {{believed}} an invasion by Germany was inevitable. However, Kirponos chose to ignore Bagramyan's viewpoint that the German offensive would employ the lightning speed Blitzkrieg tactics like those seen in the campaigns in Poland in 1939 and Western Europe in 1940. Since the winter of 1939â€“40, Bagramyan had been busy devising a battle plan that would counter threats from the western Ukraine, which was approved after numerous revisions on 10 May 1940.|$|E
60|$|The {{boys were}} taken {{completely}} <b>off</b> their <b>guard.</b> Darry made a clutch for his rifle, {{but on the}} instant Gilroy had him covered.|$|R

5|$|It's good to {{know people}} didn't see it coming. That's a big concern when you {{have this kind of}} story line and you are leading to that kind of reveal. You don't want people to be expecting it, {{especially}} in the Walking Dead. I pride myself in the fact that, when you pick up an issue of the comic, you don't know what's going to happen at any time. So any time we can work that into the show and maintain that in a television environment, it's very exciting for me. Iâ€™m glad people are being caught <b>off</b> <b>guard.</b>|$|E
5|$|On February 17, 1859, the French {{warships}} {{opened fire}} on the citadel with artillery. This attack focused on the southeastern corner of the citadel, {{where most of the}} Vietnamese artillery had been installed. The Vietnamese artillery commanders had miscalculated and had set up their cannons incorrectly, firing at excessively high angles. The cannons were not easily adjusted and thus the Vietnamese firepower was misdirected and ineffective. At around 10:00, Captain Des Pallieres led 300 French soldiers in an infantry attack. They used bamboo ladders to scale the walls under artillery support from the river. The defenders were caught <b>off</b> <b>guard</b> by this manoevre and many fled in chaos.|$|E
5|$|Soon afterwards, on 27 January 1624, an Itza war party led by AjK'in P'ol caught Mirones and his {{soldiers}} <b>off</b> <b>guard</b> and unarmed {{in the church}} at Sakalum and slaughtered them. Spanish reinforcements led by Juan Bernardo Casanova arrived too late; the Spanish soldiers had been sacrificed, hanged and beheaded, with their corpses burned and impaled on stakes {{at the entrance to}} the village; Mirones and the Franciscan priest had been bound to the church posts and then sacrificed with their hearts cut out. A number of local Maya men and women had also been hanged but not decapitated, and the attackers had burned the town.|$|E
6000|$|This {{effort of}} humor {{produced}} its intended effect. Mrs. Ellmother, thrown <b>off</b> her <b>guard,</b> actually smiled. [...] "Lord, miss, {{what will you}} say next!" ...|$|R
60|$|Sam {{was taken}} <b>off</b> his <b>guard,</b> {{and before he}} could do {{anything}} the Baxters had him by both arms and were holding him a prisoner.|$|R
