500|$|On October 2, detectives put Bundy in {{a lineup}} before DaRonch, who {{immediately}} {{identified him as}} [...] "Officer Roseland". Witnesses from Bountiful picked him from the same lineup as the stranger lurking about the high school auditorium. There was insufficient evidence linking him to Debra Kent (whose body was never found), but {{more than enough to}} charge him with aggravated kidnapping and attempted criminal assault in the DaRonch case. He was freed on $15,000 bail, paid by his parents, and spent most of the time between indictment and trial in Seattle, living in Kloepfer's house. Seattle police had insufficient evidence to charge him in the Pacific Northwest murders, but kept him under close surveillance. [...] "When Ted and I stepped <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> to go somewhere," [...] Kloepfer wrote, [...] "so many unmarked police cars started up that it sounded like the beginning of the Indy 500." ...|$|E
2500|$|Until the 1940s most births in {{the region}} {{occurred}} at home. [...] The {{birth of a child}} was considered an opportunity for family to gather and socialize. [...] Some considered it akin to quilting or corn shucking. [...] Women attended to the birthing woman while men socialized in a different room in the house or <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch.</b> [...] Family and friend would come and go throughout the labor, especially if labor was long.|$|E
2500|$|The {{doctor and}} his wife with their new [...] "family" [...] make {{their way back to}} the doctor's house, where they {{establish}} a mutually supportive permanent home. The next day, just as suddenly as his sight had been lost, the Japanese man recovers his sight. As the friends all celebrate, the doctor's wife stands <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch,</b> staring up into a white overcast sky and seems to be going blind until the camera shifts downwards, revealing that she sees the cityscape.|$|E
60|$|MISS HOWARD (pointing to <b>the</b> <b>porch).</b> She's <b>out</b> there <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch.</b>|$|R
40|$|View of a {{dormitory}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> campus of Goshen College in Indiana. The three-story building has covered <b>porches</b> <b>on</b> each floor. <b>The</b> female {{occupants of the}} dormitory are posed <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porches.</b> There is a fountain {{in front of the}} building. Postcard addressed to: Miss Genevieve Wickler of South Bend, Indiana...|$|R
60|$|As {{our friends}} marched along, some of <b>the</b> foxes came <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porches</b> and {{balconies}} {{to get a}} view of the strangers. These foxes were all handsomely dressed, the girl-foxes and women-foxes wearing gowns of feathers woven together effectively and colored in bright hues which Dorothy thought were quite artistic and decidedly attractive.|$|R
60|$|After dinner {{they sat}} <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch.</b> It {{was a perfect}} night. The cool dusk was soothing.|$|E
60|$|Old Daddy Wampole, then a {{well-known}} character throughout Idaho, came <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> of his ranch to greet them.|$|E
60|$|The {{little man}} and his wife {{presently}} came <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch.</b> Her countenance expressed a sort of resignation to thwarted hospitality.|$|E
60|$|It was {{too dark}} to read the letter without a light, and as Dave did not happen to have even a match, he {{walked back to the}} bungalows. The {{lanterns}} were hung <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porches</b> as was <b>the</b> custom, and under the light of one of these he looked at the communication he had received.|$|R
50|$|For 20 years, {{the site}} was manned by head-keeper William A. Harn of Philadelphia. Major Harn was a Union war hero who had {{commanded}} his own battery at the Battle of Gettysburg. With his wife, Kate Skillen Harn, of Maine, he had six daughters. The family was known for serving lemonade <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porches</b> of <b>the</b> keepers' house, which was constructed as a Victorian duplex during Harn's tenure.|$|R
60|$|After breakfast we went <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front <b>porch,</b> lighted up {{two of the}} landlord's flor de upas perfectos, {{and took}} a look at Georgia.|$|R
60|$|At {{this moment}} Jack and Randy came rushing {{down the stairs}} and <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> of the hotel in great excitement.|$|E
60|$|August Naab had {{no answer}} for his friend. A very old man with snow-white hair and beard came <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch.</b>|$|E
60|$|Jeff and the deputy-sheriff {{walked through}} the bar-room and <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch.</b> Miss Mayfield in an arm-chair {{looked up from her}} book.|$|E
60|$|He backed <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> little <b>porch,</b> {{and looked}} at her as she stood there. Beyond him, indeed, were his {{emotions}} then. Sad as she seemed, he wanted to make her suffer more--an inexplicable and shameful desire.|$|R
60|$|He strolled <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{sleeping}} <b>porch</b> {{and looked}} at Paula's picture under the barometers. He turned it to the wall, and sat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bed and regarded the blankness for a space. Then he turned it back again.|$|R
60|$|I {{had gone}} <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> little <b>porch</b> and stood gazing over {{the expanse of}} forest and waters lighted by the afterglow. Then I felt a hand upon my shoulder, I heard a {{familiar}} voice calling me by an old name.|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop the rascal!" [...] shouted Jack, {{and bounced}} <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> with all speed. Down the trellis he came, with Pepper following.|$|E
60|$|They passed <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> together, {{holding each}} other's hands, like children. The {{forgotten}} Rabbit was not there. Miss Mayfield called a vaquero.|$|E
60|$|Next day, {{late in the}} afternoon, when Carley came <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch,</b> she {{was hailed}} by Flo, who had just ridden in from down the canyon.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{there must}} be {{important}} news," [...] said Tom, and without further words both youths started on a swift gait for the house. Their aunt and uncle saw them coming, and ran <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back <b>porch</b> to meet them. Their aunt held up her hand warningly.|$|R
60|$|A {{door opened}} behind him. Betty came <b>out</b> <b>on</b> to <b>the</b> <b>porch,</b> and {{dropped into a}} chair close to where John's cigar glowed redly in the darkness. They sat there without speaking. The {{stirring}} of unseen cattle in the corral made a soothing accompaniment to thought.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's Gene. He's been dawdlin' <b>out</b> there <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front <b>porch,</b> and {{he knocked}} {{to let us}} know Miss Hammond's brother is comin'." ...|$|R
60|$|Daylight {{was still}} {{lingering}} when Roy {{got up and}} went <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch.</b> His keen ears had heard something. Helen fancied she herself had heard rapid hoof-beats.|$|E
60|$|Upon {{the morning}} {{after the end of the}} round-up, when she went <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch,</b> her brother and Stillwell {{appeared}} to be arguing about the identity of a horse.|$|E
60|$|Jonathan, all {{unconscious}} of the deep-laid {{scheme to}} make him happy, soon came <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch,</b> and stretched his long arms as he breathed freely of the morning air.|$|E
6000|$|His {{father was}} sitting <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front <b>porch</b> {{when he reached}} home, and he asked Frank if he had got rid of his money, and what Mr. Bushell's partner had said. Frank told him all about it, {{and after a while}} his father asked, [...] "Well, Frank, do you like to have the care of money?" ...|$|R
60|$|Andy and Fred {{were the}} first to get through washing up, and then they came downstairs to take a look around before going into the dining-room with the others for supper. They came <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hotel <b>porch,</b> and were {{surveying}} the scene before them when the two men who had inspected the hotel register lounged up to them.|$|R
60|$|When I left my {{room and}} went <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> little <b>porch,</b> I soon came to the {{conclusion}} that this was not a house of great resort. I saw nobody in front and I heard nobody within. There seemed to be an air of quiet greenness about the surroundings, and <b>the</b> little <b>porch</b> was a charming place in which to sit and look upon the evening landscape.|$|R
60|$|Dale trembled {{under the}} clasp of her hands. Loosing his own from her {{clinging}} hold, he stepped <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch.</b> At that moment John appeared on Ranger, coming at a gallop.|$|E
6000|$|That latter {{speech of}} the driver's brought Mrs. Hutter <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch.</b> [...] "Flo, come here," [...] {{she called to}} some one evidently near at hand. And then she smilingly greeted Carley.|$|E
60|$|Two {{hours later}} she heard Kathleen's gay {{laughter}} and pattering feet. Lenore took her wide-brimmed hat and went <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch.</b> Dorn was indeed {{not the same}} somber young man he had been.|$|E
6000|$|... "Get us some boiled eggs, {{bread and}} butter and plenty of fresh milk--right away," [...] ordered Mr. Merrick. [...] "The quicker it comes the more I'll pay you. Bring a table <b>out</b> here <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> and we'll eat in the open air. Where's the livery stable--eh? Oh, I see. Now, step lively, my man, and your fortune's made. I'll add {{a quarter of a}} dollar for every five minutes you save us in time." ...|$|R
2500|$|For 20 years, {{the site}} was manned by head-keeper William A. Harn of Philadelphia. [...] Major Harn was a Union war hero who had {{commanded}} his own battery at the Battle of Gettysburg.

6000|$|How {{far away}} {{it all seemed}} on those lovely nights when with my daughters beside me I lay on their broad bed <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>porch</b> and heard <b>the</b> crickets sleepily {{chirping}} and the wind playing with the leaves in the maples. To Connie's sensitive ears the rustle suggested stealthy feet and passing wings--but to me came visions of endless rivers of helmeted soldiers flowing steadily remorselessly through Belgium, and Mary Isabel said, [...] "Papa, don't you think of going to war. I won't let you." ...|$|R
