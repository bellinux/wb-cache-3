It underscores the need to enhance the adoption of <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> among smallholder farmers in Malawi as a means of increasing household’s resilience to prolonged dry spells. It investigates factors affecting households adoption decisions of <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> and the potential effect of <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> in improving maize yield when prolonged dry spells occur. To assess the factors that affect adoption of <b>organic</b> <b>manure,</b> the paper uses a binary probit model. While the effect of manure on yield was measured as treatment effect on the treated (ATT). Since adoption of manure suffers endogenous problems, {{due to the fact that}} in adoption studies, households and farm plots are not randomly assigned to groups as adopters or non-adopters but rather, they make their own choices to adopt or not, or plots are systematically selected based on their characteristics resulting in selection bias.

40|$|Diversity in {{the quality}} of <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> {{produced}} on farms in West Africa: what impact on recommendations for the use of manure?. The maintenance of humus balance in cultivated soils is a guarantee of the sustainability of production systems. In West Africa, the advice regarding application of <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> to fields remains unique and independent of the quality of <b>organic</b> <b>manures</b> available on farms. Some studies show that West African farms produce a diversity of <b>organic</b> <b>manure.</b> Should the advice for <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> application be reformulated to reflect this diversity of farm-produced <b>organic</b> <b>manure?</b> We propose to analyze the diversity of <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> produced on certain farms and estimate the optimal amount of organic fertilizer that should be applied to the fields to ensure the renewal of organic matter. The analysis distinguishes a great heterogeneity of farm-produced <b>organic</b> <b>manure.</b> Farm-produced manure with a high amendment value provides a reference for the quality of the manure, but this is also the case for farm-produced manure with an average quality and for farm-produced composts with a high or average amendment value. Depending {{on the quality of the}} manure, with these types of organic fertilizer, it would be necessary to apply between 2. 4 and 5. 1 t·ha- 1 per year on sandy soils and 2. 1 to 4. 4 t·ha- 1 per year for clay. Depending on the quality of the compost, it would be necessary to apply between 4. 1 and 5. 4 t·ha- 1 per year for sandy soils and between 3. 5 and 4. 6 t·ha- 1 per year for clay. Taking into account the heterogeneity of the quality of farm-produced <b>organic</b> <b>manure,</b> we can adapt the current technical advice to ensure a renewal of soil organic matter. However, the quantities of <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> needed are beyond the current capacity of farms.

However, its effect is unstable probably due to inappropriate <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> application managements. Accordingly, field experiments were conducted to determine the appropriate combination of application rates, placement method and C/N ratio of the <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> applied at transplanting time to increase rice yield and suppress paddy weed in organic rice cultivation. The treatment at the application rate of 10 gNm- 2 resulted insignificantly higher rice yield by 25 % than the treatment at the application rate of 5 gNm- 2. In addition, the application of the <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> to soil surface at the rate of 10 gNm- 2 increased rice yield by 31 - 45 % compared with the other treatments. The incorporation of the <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> into soil at a depth of 0 to 5 cm caused organic acids production that might damage rice roots, whereas they were little generated in the treatment applying the <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> to soil surface. Furthermore, the application of the <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> of C/N = 8 produced significantly higher (+ 83 %) weed dry weight at the harvest time than that of the <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> of C/N= 16. Consequently, the application of the <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> of C/N= 16 at the rate of 10 gNm- 2 to soil surface increased rice yield by 35 % and reduced weed dry weight by 93 % as compared with the incorporation of the <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> of C/N= 8 into soil at the rate of 5 gNm- 2. Our study showed that appropriate managements of the <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> may play an important role to increase rice yield and suppress paddy weed in organic rice cultivation. 除草剤を使わない水稲栽培では,米糠のような有機質肥料が雑草制御にしばしば利用される. しかし,その効果は不安定であり,その一因として有機物施用の不適切さが考えられる. そこで,移植時に施用される有機質肥料の施用量,位置およびC/N比の組合せが,有機水稲栽培の水稲収量および雑草抑制に及ぼす影響を明らかにすることを目的とした圃場試験を実施した. 有機質肥料を 10 gNm- 2 施用した処理は,それを 5 gNm- 2 施用した処理に比べ収量が 25 %高まった. さらに, 10 gNm- 2 の有機質肥料を田表面に施用した処理は,他の施用量と施用位置を組み合わせた処理と較べ収量がもっとも高まった(743 gm- 2). 有機質肥料を深さ 0 から 5 cmの土壌にすき込んだ処理では,水稲根の生長を阻害する可能性のある有機酸が,水稲根が存在する深さ 2 - 4 cmに生成したが,有機質肥料を田表面に施用した処理ではほとんど生成しなかった. また,C/N比が 8 の有機質肥料を施用した処理は,C/N比 16 のものを施用した処理に比べて,収穫時の雑草乾物重が 83 %高まった. 以上のことから,C/N比が 16 で 10 gNm- 2 の有機質肥料を田表面に施用した処理は,C/N比が 8 で 5 gNm- 2 のものを深さ 0 から 5 cmにすき込んだ処理に比べて,水稲収量は 35 %増加し,雑草乾物重は 93 %減少した. 以上より,本研究では,有機質肥料の施用方法を適切に組み合わせることが,有機水稲栽培での収量増加および雑草抑制に重要であることを示せた...|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to test the response of Napier-bajra hybrid grass that was subjected to treatment with 3 different types of <b>organic</b> <b>manures</b> and 3 different levels of inorganic nitrogen (20 kgN/acre, 40 kgN/acre and 60 kgN/acre) as fertilizer. <b>Organic</b> <b>manure</b> (farm yard manure, bio digested slurry and poultry manure) @ 4 tons/acre as basal manure increased the fodder biomass in a dose-dependent manner when used in combination with a nitrogen-containing fertilizer. We estimated biomass yield in terms of fresh matter yield and dry matter yield. We estimated the nutrient content in terms of percentages of crude protein and crude fibre in the grass that was subjected to different treatments. Our results show that biomass yield was significantly higher when <b>organic</b> <b>manures</b> were used in combination with maximum level (60 kg/acre) of inorganic nitrogen application. The crude protein content was comparable between the 3 types of <b>organic</b> <b>manures</b> and increased in a dose dependent manner to the level of inorganic nitrogen used. The crude fibre content was significantly (P< 0. 05) higher when poultry manure was used as <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> and was not influenced by the level of inorganic nitrogen application. There {{was no significant difference in}} the palatability of grass fed to the sheep. The cost of production of the grass decreased at higher levels of nitrogen application. From this study, was conclude that inorganic nitrogen @ 60 kg/acre and <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> @ 4 tons/acre yields significantly higher fodder biomass and that nitrogen- containing fertilizer is a critical component required for economical production of Napier- bajra hybrid grass...|$|R
40|$|A {{study on}} the use of <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> among {{vegetable}} farmers in three districts of Ghana was carried out from April 2006 to May 2006. A total of 120 vegetable farmers, 40 respondents each from the three districts were picked for the study. Questionnaire was the main instrument used for data collection. The data were analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 11. Many of the farmers (75 %) in all the districts together were found to apply fertilizer in their farming activities. A higher number of the fertilizer applicants, 25 (83. 3 %) out of 30, 20 (76. 9 %) out of 26 and 19 (55. 9 %) out of 34 respondents within Shama, Birim and Sissala districts respectively applied only organic fertilizer. The kind of organic fertilizer used by the farmers in the districts might be related to the availability. Respondents cited the cheapness and effectiveness of <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> as the reasons behind their use. The bulkiness and transportation difficulties associated with <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> were cited as the major limiting factors affecting the use of manures. Though the farmers received some education on <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> application from mainly family members and extension agents, the education was considered not enough by them, and suggested the need to provide more education on <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> to promote its use. The education on processing of <b>organic</b> <b>manure,</b> timing of application, placement of the manure, and the proper amount of manure to be applied should be intensified to help farmers maximise yield...|$|R

30|$|The readily {{available}} N from the inorganic fertilizer was fundamental in producing taller coffee plants than the <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> which needs time to decompose and produce the required nutrients. Thus, {{the differences between}} <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> and inorganic fertilizers in height may be because of the lag required for <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> to benefit crop plants, unlike inorganic fertilizers. The height benefits could not be translated into benefits on girth, as stem thickness, unlike apical growth, is promoted by availability of P which {{tends to be more}} abundant in organic nutrient sources, making the organic treatment and the integrated fertility option as competitive as inorganic fertilizers (Ahmad et al. 2006; Ibrahim and El-Samad 2009; Mufwanzala and Dikinya 2010).|$|R
40|$|Field {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to evaluate relative efficacy of <b>organic</b> <b>manures</b> in improving productivity, pest tolerance of rice in lateritic soil. Three commercial manures viz., Processed Municipality Waste (PMW), Vermicompost (VC) and Oil Cake Pellets (OCP) were assessed in relation to Farmyard Manure (FYM) and with Chemical Fertilizer (CF). Among the <b>organic</b> <b>manures</b> tested, FYM produced maximum grain yield. Maximum tolerance to pests and pathogens in terms of per cent affected hills/panicles was observed when manured with VC followed by FYM. Chemical fertilizer showed significantly higher per cent affected hills and plants compared to all other <b>organic</b> <b>manures.</b> Among the commercial manures, PMW emerged as a potential alternative to FYM and VC...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{fertilizers}} on methane emission rates was investigated using an automated closed chamber system in Chinese rice fields (Hunan Province). Each of three experiments compared two fields {{treated with a}} first uniform fertilizer dose and a second fertilizer dose which was different {{for each of the}} two fields. The uniform fertilizer doses for both fields in each experiment comprised mineral (experiment 1), organic (experiment 2) and combined mineral plus organic components (experiment 3). In all three experiments the second fertilizer dose comprised organic amendments for field 1 and no organic amendments for field 2. The rate of increase in methane emission with a given amount of <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> was found to depend on the total amount of <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> applied. A single dose of <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> increased the emission rates by factors of 2. 7 to 4. 1 as compared to fields without <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> (experiment 1). In rice fields that had already been treated with <b>organic</b> <b>manure,</b> the appl ication of a second dose of <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> only slightly enhanced the emission rates in experiment 2 by factors of 1. 1 to 1. 5 and showed no detectable increase in experiment 3. The net reduction achieved by separation of organic and mineral fertilizers was maximized by concentrating the organic amendments in the season with low emission rates, i. e. early rice, and using exclusively mineral fertilizers on late rice when emission rates were generally higher. This distribution pattern, which was not associated with significant yield losses, resulted in an annual methane emission corresponding to only 56 per cent of the methane emitted from fields treated with blended fertilizers...|$|R
