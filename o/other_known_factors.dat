The present study sought to investigate whether trait mindfulness is associated with IPV, {{as well as the}} mechanisms by which mindfulness might predict IPV. Utilizing longitudinal data collected from 247 undergraduate students, the study tested a hurdle model of IPV occurrence and frequency at Time 3 being predicted by trait mindfulness at Time 1 and <b>other</b> <b>known</b> risk <b>factors</b> at Time 2. Results indicated that trait mindfulness at time 1 was associated with IPV perpetration at Time 3; however, when controlling for <b>other</b> <b>known</b> risk <b>factors</b> at time 1, the association between mindfulness at Time 1 and IPV at Time 3 was no longer significant. Finally, results from the mediational analysis revealed a significant indirect effect of trait mindfulness on IPV through relationship satisfaction and conflict resolution while all variables were measured at the same time point, but no indirect effect of trait mindfulness at time 1 on IPV at time 3. These results indicate that although mindfulness might not be a significant direct predictor of IPV when <b>other</b> <b>known</b> risk <b>factors</b> are controlled for, it is important since mindfulness indirectly predicts IPV through other relationship processes when measured at the same time point.

40|$|Membrane {{function}} {{at the start}} of peritoneal dialysis (PD) treatment, measured as solute transport rate and ultrafiltration capacity, varies considerably between individuals. Although this can be correlated to clinical factors such as age and body habitus, this accounts for little of the variance seen. It is increasingly clear, however, that this variability in membrane function does impact on clinical outcomes. Specifically, high solute transport increases mortality risk, independent of <b>other</b> <b>known</b> <b>factors</b> such as age, comorbidity, and residual renal function. High solute transport causes earlier loss of the osmotic gradient when a low molecular weight osmolyte such as glucose is used. This will result in an earlier and lower peak in the ultrafiltration achieved combined with a higher fluid absorption rate once the osmotic gradient is lost. It is therefore quite plausible tha...|$|E

Conclusions No unifying etiology for the disease can be presented as it is found associated with environmental factors, medications, infections and is even considered a variant of asthma with predisposition to vasculitic involvement. Therefore, {{it is important to recognize}} this disease and be aware of underdiagnosis because of emphasis on pathologic evidence.

Using a sample of 7, 434 IPOs from 1982 to 2006, we find that IPOs in industries with high growth prospects generally earn high short-run and long-run returns {{up to three years}} after the IPO. Industry growth has a larger economic impact on long-run performance than any <b>other</b> <b>known</b> <b>factors</b> such as underwriter quality and offer proceeds. However, during the internet bubble period (1999 - 2000), the effect of industry growth on long-run performance reverses so that IPOs in high-growth industries underperform in the long run.

The divergence of investor opinion about industry growth, on the other hand, does not appear to explain IPO stock performance, even for the bubble period...|$|E
40|$|Background. Patients with {{cirrhosis}} and advancing {{hepatic insufficiency}} may show {{various degrees of}} other organ malfunction, including brain, kidney, and lung. Several studies have also shown a high prevalence of adrenal insufficiency in cirrhotic patients that may cause hemodynamic instability. Materials and Methods. In this study we prospectively evaluated adrenal function in a population of nonhospitalized cirrhotic patients. Categorization of liver disease severity was done according to model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score. Adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation testing was performed on subjects using 250 [*]μg of synthetic short acting hormone; radio immunoassay {{was used to measure}} plasma cortisol levels. Results. Of 105 cirrhotic patients, 15. 23 % had evidence of adrenal insufficiency. These patients were not statistically different from those with normal adrenal function in levels of serum creatinine or bilirubin, MELD score, or presence of cirrhosis related complications. Significant differences were seen in mean international normalized ratio and serum sodium. Patients with a sodium level < 135 [*]mEq/L had a higher rate (31. 25 %) of adrenal insufficiency. Conclusion. Adrenal dysfunction was identified in a population of stable nonhospitalized cirrhotic patients.
