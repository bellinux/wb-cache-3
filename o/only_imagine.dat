Anna Lowman of TV Scoop {{noted that some}} {{of the power of the}} featured Doctor Who music came from the audience associating the themes with powerful scenes from the television series.

500|$|Colin Jacobson {{from the}} DVD Movie Guide website complained about {{its lack of}} {{sharpness}} and commented, [...] "Frankly, I'm {{at a loss to}} understand how such an unattractive video hit the shelves". He also criticized the lack of extra content, but complimented the DVD's sound. Jacobson gave the release's image, sound and extras ratings of D+, A-, D, respectively. Aaron Beriele from DVD Talk website shared Jacobson's views, saying that it was [...] "a wonderful show from Madonna and I can <b>only</b> <b>imagine</b> {{what it was like to}} actually be there. As for the DVD, it offers outstanding audio quality, but only so-so image quality. Still, it's a terrific show and the DVD still certainly gets a recommendation." ...|$|E

Live versions of ten of the band's songs were also included on some versions of the album [...] "I Can <b>Only</b> <b>Imagine</b> (Symphony Edition)" [...] was recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London with the London Session Orchestra. [...] "Ten Simple Rules", described as having a [...] "Fifties twist" [...] sound, was originally included as music video on Hoop Dogz, a children's video DVD. Lyrically, it relates the Ten Commandments. The band had begun playing it in concerts and, according to Millard, it developed a following of fans who {{wanted it to be}} put on CD. [...] "Only Temporary", a rock song with a [...] "distinct southern influence", was a new track, which the band had not included on any other album or project.|$|E

500|$|... "Talking Heads" [...] {{received}} positive reviews. Of Kathy Searle's {{appearance as}} [...] "steely" [...] Irina, CelebrityNetWorth said, [...] "Searle impressively {{took on a}} Russian accent with flying colors in the series Body Of Proof". Orlando expressed her disappointment at John Carroll Lynch's character Bud Morris not appearing in this episode saying, [...] "The show lacked his sarcastic wit and his banter with Megan. We're just a few episode's into this show and I've already been enjoying their chemistry". She also praised Searle's performance saying, [...] "When Irina described cutting up Callum's body it was with an eerie coldness. She liked the man and he cared for her. Yet, once dead {{he was no longer}} an asset to her but a problem that needed to be disposed of, literally. I could <b>only</b> <b>imagine</b> the parts of yourself you'd have to shut down {{to be able to take}} a hacksaw to someone you were fond of". Also praising Kelly AuCoin's performance, she said that she wasn't [...] "sure who was more disturbing, Irina or the landlord who swung a hammer at the man's head and then went on with his day as though nothing had occurred". Finally, she praised the scenes between Megan and Lacey (Mary Mouser).|$|E
500|$|The Stone Tape was a {{significant}} influence on John Carpenter's 1987 film Prince of Darkness in which {{a group of scientists}} investigate a mysterious cylinder discovered {{in the basement of a}} church. Besides directing the film, Carpenter wrote the screenplay under the pseudonym [...] "Martin Quatermass", and included a reference to [...] "Kneale University". This homage did little to impress Kneale, who wrote in The Observer, [...] "For the record I have had nothing to do with the film and I have not seen it. It sounds pretty bad. With an homage like this, one might say, who needs insults? I can <b>only</b> <b>imagine</b> that it is a whimsical riposte for my having my name removed from a film I wrote a few years ago [...] and which Mr Carpenter carpentered into sawdust". The play also influenced the 1982 Steven Spielberg and Tobe Hooper film Poltergeist. In the 2004 BBC7 Radio Serial [...] "Ghost Zone", a character refers explicitly to the [...] "Stone Tape theory" [...] as an explanation for the way an invading alien intelligence is [...] "replaying" [...] scenes and figures from the past of the remote Scottish village in which the story is set. Author Marty Ross has explicitly acknowledged the influence of Kneale's work, and the Quatermass serials in particular, on his own BBC SF drama.|$|E
500|$|The {{commercial}} for the fragrance found {{controversy in the}} United Kingdom with UK's Advertising Standards Authority. It was banned from the country's daytime TV rotation due to its [...] "sexy imagery" [...] and was only shown after 7:30 in the afternoon. The U.K.'s Advertising Standards Authority commented on the ban decision, stating [...] "We considered that Beyoncé's body movements and the camera's prolonged focus on shots of her dress slipping away to partially expose her breasts created a sexually provocative ad that was unsuitable {{to be seen by}} young children." [...] Coty, Inc., the world's largest fragrance company, replied to the ban, stating that they do not think there is anything too explicit about the TV spot. Coty continued that the commercial was [...] "intended to reflect the singer Beyoncé's personal 'sexy chic' style," [...] and while Beyoncé's cleavage is exposed at certain parts of the commercial, Coty stated that it is not [...] "overtly graphic or explicitly sexual and at no point was Beyoncé naked." [...] Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly defended Beyoncé, saying that [...] " [...] is sexy. It's suggestive and sultry. But it's certainly not X-rated." [...] Beyoncé's mother and collaborator Tina Knowles called the commercial's ban [...] "very good", as people purposely went to watch the video which further increased sales. Beyoncé herself also responded jokingly to the ban, saying, [...] "Where's the wind coming from? It started out only , and then it kind of created this effect with my hair... You can <b>only</b> <b>imagine,</b> the show is two and a half hours. It's really, really warm onstage." ...|$|E

5000|$|For conceiving a Nazi film theory Goebbels {{suggested}} as formative material the Hamburg Dramaturgy and Laokoon, or the Limitations of Poetry by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, and also demanded [...] "realistic characters" [...] pointing to Shakespeare.

500|$|... 10 {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Jared Johnson of AllMusic gave the album 4.5 out of 5 stars and noted {{it as an}} 'Album Pick', calling it [...] "one {{of the best and}} most long-awaited greatest-hits albums in recent memory". Johnson praised the amount of content, saying [...] "For fans, the videos alone make this worth picking up". Jenna DeWitt of The Baylor Lariat gave it an A-, praising [...] "I Can <b>Only</b> <b>Imagine</b> (Symphony Edition)" [...] as [...] "awe-inspiring" [...] as well as the DVD content, and saying [...] "the only mistake in buying this album is if you are really tired of the extensive radio airplay that these hits have gotten". Dave Derbyshire of Cross Rhythms gave the album nine out of ten squares, calling it a [...] "brilliant introduction" [...] to the band. His only criticism on the album was that he considered a few of the songs as being overly sentimental. Matt Johnson of Jesus Freak Hideout gave the album three out of five stars. Johnson noted the DVD content as being [...] "what really makes this worth your money", but was critical of the interface; he also felt the CD content, while solid, did not include enough songs and that the new recordings weren't particularly impressive. He noted the orchestra and Millard's vocals as conflicting on the re-recording of [...] "I Can Only Imagine", but also said that it [...] "takes the song to new heights than previously conceived". Justin Michael of Sight Magazine gave the album a positive review, calling it [...] "A must for all MercyMe fans, for those who need a hooky melody with a message and for people who love getting a free DVD with their albums!"; he also praised the one-camera tour videos, but noted [...] "Ten Simple Rules" [...] is [...] "not their brightest musical moment".|$|E
500|$|I Am... World Tour was produced, directed, {{and edited}} by Beyoncé {{for her own}} {{production}} company Parkwood Pictures. It contains tour footage from 108 shows {{that took place in}} 78 cities, 32 countries, and 6 continents in the presence of 1.1 million fans around the world. The show is a combination of performance clips from the tour, as well as backstage moments. I Am... World Tour also serves as the directorial debut for Beyoncé. On this occasion, she confessed that {{it was a lot of}} work for her. Nevertheless, she was very happy and eager for her fans to see her DVD directed by herself. She explained, [...] "I'm so excited – this is my directorial debut. I am just thrilled that my fans are going to be in the theatre with me and I can't wait for everyone to see it. It took me nine months to edit because I wanted to show a little bit of each show, each performance on tour, and it was 116 shows, so you can <b>only</b> <b>imagine</b> how much work it was, [...] it was worth it." [...] At the New York City screening of the DVD, Beyoncé further explained that she was completely [...] "hands-on", deciding which moments made the final cut and which ones wound up on the cutting-room floor, stating, [...] "It was hard work. I learned so much. I have a new respect for directors and I think I would like to do more of it." [...] Some of the behind-the-scenes footage were shot by Beyoncé on her laptop. The DVD captures concert footage from cities in Europe, Asia, South America, and the United States, all edited into one concert. However, I Am... World Tour was significantly recorded at London's larger O2 Arena, a few months after the I Am... Yours concert. A live CD of the concert, a behind-the-scenes documentary of her life along the tour and a 20-page book of exclusive photos are all included in the package. According to a press release, [...] "it is meant to create the ne plus ultra Knowles concert experience, seen from her perspective".|$|E
500|$|Nick is {{described}} by the soap opera's official website as often thinking [...] "with his heart instead of his head". When the teenaged version of Nick debuted on the series in 1994, he was characterized as a [...] "frisky" [...] 16-year-old [...] "rich-kid", with Morrow being able to [...] "kick back and relax in typical teenager attire—jeans, tees, etc". Morrow said [...] "Nick's eager and fun-loving ... and that's fun to play". Nick also has an [...] "eye for the ladies". In 1999, Morrow told soap magazine Soap Opera Digest that Nick has a [...] "fiery personality", and [...] "if you attack him, he's going to fight back". Morrow has insisted {{that he is not}} concerned about viewer backlash towards Nick, having stated: [...] "My job is not to be palatable to the audience. I want to tell a convincing story. I have never been a man in love with two women. I can <b>only</b> <b>imagine</b> what that must be like." [...] The actor felt that if he needed to [...] "look like an ass and a bad guy" [...] to keep people interested in his portrayal, [...] "so be it". He told Tommy Garrett of Canyon News: [...] "I’d rather be playing an imperfect good guy than a boring one. There is a lot of me in Nick, there is not that big of a stretch for me on a daily basis". A controversial storyline occurred in 2011 when alongside his sisters Abby Newman (Marcy Rylan) and Victoria Abbott (Amelia Heinle), Nick sued his father. Morrow felt that Nick wants to teach Victor a lesson, hoping he will [...] "appreciate his children more". He also stated Nick wants to get respect, as he isn't [...] "this young and impressionable boy who looks at his father in this hero light anymore." [...] By the following year, Morrow opined that Nick is now [...] "more mature" [...] with his decision-making, and that [...] "He's got a very practical view of the world, and I like that he's kind of become a steady character on the show". He stated that although the part isn't as [...] "splashy or flashy" [...] as Adam Newman (Michael Muhney), Nick's onscreen brother, he [...] "really" [...] likes Nick because [...] "he's a good dude" [...] and a [...] "very supportive" [...] person.|$|E

2500|$|It may be {{possible}} to uphold the distinction between persons whilst still aggregating utility, if it accepted that people can be influenced by empathy. This position is advocated by Iain King, who has suggested the evolutionary basis of empathy means humans can take into account the interests of other individuals, but only on a one-to-one basis, [...] "since we can <b>only</b> <b>imagine</b> ourselves in the mind of one other person at a time." [...] King uses this insight to adapt utilitarianism, and it may help reconcile Bentham's philosophy with deontology and virtue ethics.|$|E
2500|$|Whether Nicola Pisano {{learned his}} {{appreciation}} of neo-classicism in Frederick II’s workshop {{or whether he}} picked up inspiration from the ruins of Roman sculpture that were strewn about Pisa during that time period one can <b>only</b> <b>imagine,</b> but what is known is that Nicola mastered the combination of Christian traditions such as the Narrative of Christ {{with the use of}} Roman and Late Antique style. With the similar pulpit in Pisa being finished in 1260 and this Siena pulpit being completed in 1268 {{it can be seen that}} Nicola embraced the Classic revival before any of those deemed “Renaissance Artists” ...|$|E

60|$|I {{must confess}} {{that after this}} my nerve, which is {{generally}} pretty good, gave out {{to such an extent}} that I think I fainted for a few minutes.

2500|$|The {{government}} itself {{agreed that the}} private sector contributes about 90 per cent to the nation's Gross Domestic Product. With SMEs forming about 65 per cent of the private sector operations, one can <b>only</b> <b>imagine</b> what the effects of the new move by the bank will be on the economy." [...] Banks in the country, for along time, {{had been part of the}} problem of the real sector, saying they would rather get involved in round-tripping and short-term lending for commercial activities, than to lend to businesses with manufacturing operations. It is in this light that the new twist is commendable of emulation by other banks. First, through its current GMD, has shown an unusual disposition to the plight of small scale industrialists. I think he deserves all the kudos." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{more subtle}} but perhaps {{fundamental}} aspect to Nabokov's delineation of his characters {{is that while}} Ivanov, spiritually free, escapes the view of others, the Soviet is already trapped under the others' gaze. How their faces and appearances are revealed to others becomes a defining characteristic of their personalities. The reader is told at the very start that Razor lacks a facade, and when acquaintances tried to recall his appearance they [...] "could <b>only</b> <b>imagine</b> him in profile". Whereas {{as soon as the}} Soviet enters the barber, [...] "the newcomer's reflection appeared in all the mirrors at once, in profile, three-quarter-face, and shown the waxen bald spot in back". The point is more subtle but important nevertheless - the free man escapes the view of others while the man who denies that freedom is forever trapped in the gaze of other people.|$|E
2500|$|The Fourth Crusade saw the {{destruction}} of many homes in Constantinople {{and much of the}} city on fire. It is difficult to determine what books were burned in the libraries of Constantinople, though one can <b>only</b> <b>imagine</b> that few would be available today {{were it not for the}} works of Demetrius Triclinius, Manuel Moschopoulos, Thomas Magister and Maximos Planudes. New editions of poets, such as Hesiod and Pindar, were made and their metric systems were reconstructed with competence. They wrote about such works as Scholia and Pindar. Countless works are also included, such as the tragedians of Sophocles and Euripides, Ptolemy's Geography, Nonnus of Panaopolis' Dionysiaca, edits and [...] "rediscoveries" [...] on Plutarch and the Greek Anthology of epigrams.
