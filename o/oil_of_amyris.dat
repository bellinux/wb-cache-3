50|$|Amyris is an {{integrated}} renewable products company providing sustainable alternatives {{to a broad}} range of petroleum-sourced products and rare materials. Amyris, in conjunction with various partners, is creating industrial scale supplies of vitamins, captive perfume molecules like Ambroxan, a patchouli substitute and Farnesene which can be used in tires, and lubricant, as well as their own beauty care product line using squalane, their substitute molecule for shark oil. Amyris uses its industrial synthetic biology platform to convert plant sugars into a variety of hydrocarbon molecules, flexible building blocks which {{can be used in a}} wide range of products. They do this by reengineering yeast so it can recreate complicated molecules. The time to market was reduced four fold after Amyris teamed with Darpa. Amyris is commercializing these products both as renewable ingredients in cosmetics, flavors, fragrances, polymers, lubricants and consumer products, and also as renewable diesel and jet fuels. Amyris Brasil S.A., a subsidiary <b>of</b> <b>Amyris,</b> oversees the establishment and expansion <b>of</b> <b>Amyris’s</b> production in Brazil. Amyris also has fuel distribution capabilities in the United States through its subsidiary, Amyris Fuels LLC. Founded in 2003 and headquartered in Emeryville, Ca, Amyris has raised over $120 million in equity funding to-date, including investments from Royal DSM, Total S.A., Khosla Ventures, Votorantim Novos Negócios, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, TPG Biotech, and DAG Ventures as well as DARPA.

50|$|The trunks <b>of</b> <b>Amyris</b> species exude elemi, {{a type of}} balsam (oleoresin) that {{contains}} elemic acids, liquid sesquiterpenes, and triterpenes such as α- and β-amyrin among other components. It is used medicinally and in lacquers. The wood is often used for torches and firewood. Its high resin content causes it to burn brightly, and it will burn well even when green. In addition, the wood is hard, heavy, close-grained, can take a high polish, and repels dry wood termites. Essential oils containing caryophyllene, cadinene, and cadinol are extracted from A. balsamifera and A. elemifera. These are used in varnishes, perfumes, medicines, cosmetics, soaps, and incense.|$|R
