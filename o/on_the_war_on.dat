5|$|Duhalde was {{appointed}} {{president in the}} aftermath of the September 11 attacks, when the foreign policy of the United States was strictly focused <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> Terror. Initially, the Argentine society was divided on how to manage the bilateral relations with the US. One group wanted to keep the close relations of the previous decade, as Argentina might need foreign help to deal with the crisis. The other group preferred to maintain more distant relations. Duhalde sought to strike a balance between both options, and eventually leaned towards the second when the US refused to help Argentina.|$|E

In her research, she has focused <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> Drugs, incarceration, mandatory sentencing, and sentencing guidelines, primarily as they affect women and children of color, but also young black men. In 2006, Levy-Pounds founded the Community Justice Project (CJP), a partnership between UST's School of Law and the Saint Paul chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). The CJP allows law students interested in working with underserved communities to gain experience through academic writing, fora, and interaction with local governments and communities.|$|E

25|$|Since {{assuming}} {{office of}} the premier, Gillani was planning to visit neighbouring Afghanistan, but some unresolved issues like absence of a joint platform to discuss bilateral issues, border conflicts, and different views <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>on</b> terror prevented the trip.

25|$|Akin's {{comments}} were widely {{thought to be}} the main reason he lost the senatorial election. Exit polls reported that 64% of voters said that Akin's comment was important in their voting decision, and among those voters 74% voted for Claire McCaskill while 18% voted for Akin. According to Jennifer Haberkorn of Politico, Akin lost his election bid because of a backlash from women voters. A poll released on August 23 by Rasmussen Reports showed a steep drop in support for Akin among Missouri voters; McCaskill led Akin in this poll by roughly 10 points. Akin had earlier been in the lead. Akin's comments encouraged new debates <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> Women. Political analysts drew attention to Akin's co-sponsorship of anti-abortion bills with vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan, and the Obama campaign tried to link Ryan to Akin's remarks. James Rowley of Businessweek wrote that the incident had drawn attention to the Republican Party's advocacy for a total ban on abortion.|$|E
500|$|Brubaker {{wanted to}} examine the reality of being a vigilante, and Kill or Be Killed focuses on the ramifications of {{violence}} {{and its effect on}} the Dylan’s loved ones.

[...] Although Dylan becomes a murderer {{at the beginning of the}} story, Brubaker hopes the character's plight is sympathetic enough that readers will root for him. Dylan's arrangement with the demon has been interpreted as commentary <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> Terror and the racially motivated violence publicised in the US in the two years prior to the book's publication.|$|E
500|$|George W. Bush {{took office}} in January 2001, and changed the American policy towards {{countries}} in financial crises. The Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, a critic of financial aids, said, [...] "We're working {{to find a way}} to create a sustainable Argentina, not just one that continues to consume the money of the plumbers and carpenters in the United States who make $50,000 a year and wonder what in the world we're doing with their money". The September 11 attacks occurred a few months later, and the U.S. focused its foreign policy <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> Terror against countries suspected of harboring terrorist organizations. As a result, the U.S. gave no further financial aid to Argentina. This policy was confirmed after an interview of Bush with the Brazilian president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who confirmed Brazil would not be affected by the Argentine crisis.|$|E

500|$|On May 3, Gilmore {{participated in}} the first {{televised}} GOP debate featured on MSNBC at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California. The first question he received regarded the Iraq War, which he defended, stating that it represented the [...] "entire Middle East issue" [...] which he described as a [...] "fundamental problem" [...] that he connected to the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis. During an exchange with California Representative Duncan Hunter, Gilmore expressed the responsibility to capture Osama bin Laden and to fight terrorism with the help from allies and to use diplomacy to end the [...] "sea of hostility" [...] that he believed existed from [...] "Morocco, {{all the way through}} the Middle East, [...] all the way to the Philippines." [...] Later in the debate, he announced his disagreement with a possible constitutional amendment to give naturalized citizens such as California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, the ability to run for president. On abortion, Gilmore confirmed his support for a woman's right to an abortion in the first eight to twelve weeks of pregnancy, but commented that he operated as a pro-life governor. He affirmed his opposition to stem-cell research. At the end of the debate, Gilmore asserted his attributes as a [...] "consistent Conservative" [...] while surprising many when he stated that he would not pardon Scooter Libby. He established his opposition to a National Identification Card, and highlighted the need to be [...] "vigorous <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>on</b> terror", focus on homeland security, and become energy independent in the next presidency.|$|E

Apparently, it isn’t {{enough to}} call a high-priority {{initiative}} a High-Priority Initiative. If it’s really important, only a wimp refuses to call it war, almost without regard to {{its relationship to the}} real thing. There is something about the presidency that loves war-talk. Even at its most metaphorical, martial rhetoric allows the President to invoke his special mystique as Commander in Chief, calling the public to sacrifice greatly {{for the good of the}} nation. Perhaps the clarion call to pseudo-war is just the thing the President needs to ram an initiative through a reluctant Congress. Perhaps it provides rhetorical cover for unilateral actions of questionable legality.

2500|$|Later, on December 7, 2005, Lieberman said, [...] "It is {{time for}} Democrats who {{distrust}} President Bush to acknowledge {{that he will be}} Commander-in-Chief for three more critical years, and that in matters of war we undermine Presidential credibility at our nation’s peril.
