This decision was made after an incident, although sources vary as to the specifics: either a lion was accused of biting a soldier, or a sailor, Ensign Seymour, had been bitten by a monkey. The Menagerie buildings were removed in 1852 but the Keeper of the Royal Menagerie was entitled to use the Lion Tower as a house for life.

5|$|After the tender, 80 {{employees}} {{were transferred to}} the subsidiary, including the director, chartered engineer Arne Fosen. To the press {{he said that the}} increased efficiency in the organization was related to a small administration, and being able to use uniform trains.

Following the PSO, NSB Anbud would operate nine Class 69g trains, which are somewhat smaller than the locomotive-hauled and Class 70 trains. These would be owned by NSB, but rented by the subsidiary. The ministry would pay for a NOK 40 million overhaul <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock.</b> Representatives from the labor union said they feared for the flexibility of NSB, since 80 {{employees were}} now bound up in serving only a single line.

5|$|Major modern {{economic}} statistics, such as {{unemployment and}} GDP, were not compiled {{on a regular}} and standardized basis until after World War II. The average duration of the 11 recessions between 1945 and 2001 is 10 months, compared to 18 months for recessions between 1919 and 1945, and 22 months for recessions from 1854 to 1919. Because of the great changes in the economy over the centuries, {{it is difficult to}} compare the severity of modern recessions to early recessions. No recession of the post-World War II era has come anywhere near the depth of the Great Depression, which lasted from 1929 until 1941 and was caused by the 1929 crash <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> market and other factors.|$|E
