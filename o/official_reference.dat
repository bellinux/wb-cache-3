5|$|Similarly {{to other}} {{distributed}} computing projects, Folding@home quantitatively assesses user computing {{contributions to the}} project through a credit system. All units from a given protein project have uniform base credit, which is determined by benchmarking one or more work units from that project on an <b>official</b> <b>reference</b> machine before the project is released. Each user receives these base points for completing every work unit, though {{through the use of}} a passkey they can receive added bonus points for reliably and rapidly completing units which are more demanding computationally or have a greater scientific priority. Users may also receive credit for their work by clients on multiple machines. This point system attempts to align awarded credit with the value of the scientific results.|$|E

25|$|It {{was unclear}} how the People's Charter would be officially implemented. The interim {{government}} {{announced that the}} public would be consulted, but no <b>official</b> <b>reference</b> to a referendum was made. Legally, if the Charter was deemed to alter the Constitution, {{it could only be}} adopted by a two-thirds majority of elected members of Parliament, which was not in session, having been dismissed after the coup. Deposed Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase, who opposed the Charter, however, stated that a referendum would constitute legal validation. In the end, the abrogation of the Constitution in 2009 made the question redundant, and much of the essence of the People's Charter was included in the new constitution promulgated by the interim government in 2013.|$|E

Although highly decorated and commended as a positive example, the Agitprop Section founder was generally introduced as a dedicated [...] "party activist", a communist powerhouse rather than a national instructor: while honoring him with the Star of the Socialist Republic, Ceaușescu made sure to remind the audience that Răutu's history {{had its share of}} [...] "minuses and unfulfilled chapters".|$|E

2500|$|A {{feature of}} ALGOL 68, {{inherited}} from the ALGOL tradition, is its different representations. There is a representation language used to describe algorithms in printed work, a strict language (rigorously defined in the Report) and an <b>official</b> <b>reference</b> language intended {{to be used in}} actual compiler input. In the examples you will observe bold typeface words, this is the strict language.

2500|$|Tom McCluskie {{stated that}} in his {{capacity}} as archive manager and historian at Harland and Wolff, he [...] "never saw any <b>official</b> <b>reference</b> to the name 'Gigantic' being used or proposed for the third of the Olympic class vessels". Some hand-written changes were added to the order book and dated January 1912. These only dealt with the ship's moulded width, not her name. However, at least one set of documentation exists, in which Hingley's discuss the order for the ship's anchors; this documentation states that the name of the ship is Gigantic.|$|E
2500|$|Indeed, the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships (DANFS), the <b>official</b> <b>reference</b> {{work for}} vessels of the US Navy, has {{exemplified}} and evolved with this identity controversy. [...] In its 1969 edition it {{stated that the}} original Constellation was [...] "Laid up in ordinary at Norfolk from 1845 through 1853, she {{was found to be}} greatly in need of extensive repair. Thus, in 1854 she was brought into the yard and, in keeping with the needs of the time, modified into a 22-gun sloop-of-war." [...] By its 2004 edition this had been modified to state the original Constellation was broken up at Norfolk in 1853.|$|E
50|$|A common urban legend about Charles Leiper Grigg {{is that he}} was an albino, {{and that}} the red dot on the bottle is {{supposed}} to represent his red eyes. In fact there are no <b>official</b> <b>references</b> to Grigg having been an albino, and in (black-and-white) photographs his eyes appear normally pigmented. 7-up logo with the red dot came into use in the 1970s, after Grigg had died.|$|R

2500|$|Tismăneanu and {{historian}} Cristian Vasile note that Roller's downfall was a sacrificial offering by Leonte Răutu, {{who survived the}} [...] "unmasking" [...] period and was still a culture boss under the national communism of the 1960s. Gheorghiu-Dej's successor Ceaușescu allowed young authors—Ileana Vrancea, Ion Cristoiu—or senior figures—Iorgu Iordan—, to publish works critical of the Zhdanov Doctrine. Although these mentioned Roller by name, Răutu was entirely exempt. Iordan calls Roller the [...] "evil genie" [...] of the Romanian Academy, and makes him responsible for the more [...] "fanatical" [...] decisions—such as granting posthumous Academy membership to the Marxist poet Dumitru Theodor Neculuță. A bizarre exception to this rule was an <b>official</b> <b>reference</b> work, the 1978 Enciclopedia istoriografiei românești ("The Encyclopedia of Romanian Historiography"). It has an entry on Roller, which does not feature any negative commentary, while Răutu is entirely absent.|$|E
2500|$|Stockholm, with a February mean of , has an {{oceanic climate}} (Köppen Cfb) {{for the most}} recent <b>official</b> <b>reference</b> period. Due to the city's high northerly latitude, {{daylight}} varies widely from more than 18 hours around midsummer, to only around 6 hours in late December. Stockholm has relatively mild weather compared to other locations at similar latitude, or even farther south. With an average of just over 1800 hours of sunshine per year, {{it is also one}} of the sunniest cities in Northern Europe, receiving more sunshine than Paris, London and a few other major European cities of a more southerly latitude. Due to recent amelioration of the climate it could be classified as cold marine with significant continental influence if the [...] isotherm is used. Because of the urban heat island and the prevailing wind travelling over land rather than sea during summer months, Stockholm has the warmest summers in the Nordic countries.|$|E
