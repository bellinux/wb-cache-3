5|$|In the {{treatment}} of diabetic foot infections, linezolid appears to be cheaper and more effective than vancomycin. In a 2004 open-label study, it was as effective as ampicillin/sulbactam and Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and far superior in patients with foot ulcers and no <b>osteomyelitis,</b> but with significantly higher rates of adverse effects. A 2008 meta-analysis of 18 randomized controlled trials, however, found that linezolid treatment failed as often as other antibiotics, regardless of whether patients had <b>osteomyelitis.</b>|$|E
5|$|After missing {{only two}} games out of 246 {{in his first}} three years of NBA play, Yao endured an {{extended}} period on the inactive list in his fourth season after developing <b>osteomyelitis</b> in the big toe on his left foot, and surgery was performed on the toe on December 18, 2005. Despite missing 21 games while recovering, Yao again had the most fan votes to start the 2006 NBA All-Star Game.|$|E
5|$|The {{veterinary}} uses of clindamycin {{are quite}} similar to its human indications, and include treatment of <b>osteomyelitis,</b> skin infections, and toxoplasmosis, {{for which it is}} the preferred drug in dogs and cats. Toxoplasmosis rarely causes symptoms in cats, but can do so in very young or immunocompromised kittens and cats.|$|E
5|$|Several tyrannosaurid skeletons {{from the}} Two Medicine Formation and Judith River Formation of Montana {{probably}} belong to Gorgosaurus, although it remains uncertain whether {{they belong to}} G. libratus or a new species. One specimen from Montana (TCMI 2001.89.1), housed in the Children's Museum of Indianapolis, shows evidence of severe pathologies, including healed leg, rib, and vertebral fractures, <b>osteomyelitis</b> (infection) {{at the tip of}} the lower jaw resulting in permanent tooth loss, and possibly a brain tumor.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the {{indications}} for linezolid use {{approved by}} the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are the treatment of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections, with or without bacterial invasion of the bloodstream; nosocomial pneumonia (hospital-acquired) and community-acquired pneumonia caused by S. aureus or S. pneumoniae; complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) caused by susceptible bacteria, including diabetic foot infection, unless complicated by <b>osteomyelitis</b> (infection of the bone and bone marrow); and uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections caused by S. pyogenes or S. aureus. The manufacturer advises {{against the use of}} linezolid for community-acquired pneumonia or uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections caused by MRSA. In the United Kingdom, pneumonia and cSSSIs are the only indications noted in the product labeling.|$|E
5|$|Infection with {{smallpox}} {{is focused}} in small blood vessels {{of the skin}} and in the mouth and throat before disseminating. In the skin it results in a characteristic maculopapular rash and, later, raised fluid-filled blisters. V. major produced a more serious disease and had an overall mortality rate of 30–35 percent. V. minor caused a milder form of disease (also known as alastrim) which killed about 1 percent of those it infects. Long-term complications of V. major infection included characteristic scars, commonly on the face, which occur in 65–85 percent of survivors. Blindness resulting from corneal ulceration and scarring, and limb deformities due to arthritis and <b>osteomyelitis</b> were less common complications, seen in about 2–5 percent of cases.|$|E
5|$|Other {{complications}} include encephalitis (1 in 500 patients), {{which is}} more common in adults and may cause temporary disability; permanent pitted scars, most notably on the face; and complications involving the eyes (2 percent of all cases). Pustules can form on the eyelid, conjunctiva, and cornea, leading to complications such as conjunctivitis, keratitis, corneal ulcer, iritis, iridocyclitis, and optic atrophy. Blindness results in approximately 35 percent to 40 percent of eyes affected with keratitis and corneal ulcer. Hemorrhagic smallpox can cause subconjunctival and retinal hemorrhages. In 2 to 5 percent of young children with smallpox, virions reach the joints and bone, causing <b>osteomyelitis</b> variolosa. Lesions are symmetrical, most common in the elbows, tibia, and fibula, and characteristically cause separation of an epiphysis and marked periosteal reactions. Swollen joints limit movement, and arthritis may lead to limb deformities, ankylosis, malformed bones, flail joints, and stubby fingers.|$|E
5|$|Banister {{attended}} La Marque High School in La Marque, Texas. At La Marque, Banister {{played for}} the school's baseball, basketball, and American football teams. During his sophomore year of high school, Banister injured his right ankle while playing baseball. During an examination of his ankle, which was slow to heal, {{he was diagnosed with}} bone cancer. He had developed cysts that required skin grafting to treat. An infection in his leg {{led to the development of}} <b>osteomyelitis,</b> which spread from his right ankle to just below his knee. Doctors recommended amputation in order to save the rest of his leg, but Banister refused, as he hoped he would be able to continue his baseball career. Doctors performed seven operations on his leg, which saved it from being amputated. In his senior year, Banister suffered a knee injury playing American football, which nearly led to him being cut from the baseball team due to his decreased mobility. His father suggested he change positions and become a catcher, which allowed him to remain on the baseball team.|$|E
5|$|The {{most serious}} {{pathology}} discovered {{was in a}} series of five large tail vertebrae. The first two vertebrae showed only minor abnormalities {{with the exception of a}} large groove that extended along the left side of both bones. However, the next three vertebrae were completely fused together at many different points, forming a solid bony mass. There is no sign of any other vertebrae after the fifth in the series, indicating that the tail ended there prematurely. From the size of the last vertebrae, scientists judged that about ten vertebrae were lost. One explanation for this pathology is severe physical trauma resulting in the loss of the tail tip, followed by <b>osteomyelitis</b> (infection) of the last remaining vertebrae. Alternatively, the infection may have come first and led to the end of the tail becoming necrotic and falling off. This is the first example of tail truncation known in a non-avian theropod dinosaur.|$|E
5|$|S. iniae {{can cause}} {{opportunistic}} infections in weakened or immunocompromised humans. It is most {{commonly associated with}} bacteremic cellulitis, but {{has been known to}} cause endocarditis, meningitis, <b>osteomyelitis,</b> and septic arthritis. The first recognized cases of human infection occurred in Texas in 1991 and in Ottawa in 1994, but the sources of infection were not determined. Human infection with S.iniae was also identified in Toronto between 15 and 20 December 1995, when three Asian patients were admitted to a hospital with cellulitis of the hand after injuring themselves while handling raw fish. All three were found to have bacteremia, initially attributed to Streptococcus uberis, but later correctly identified as S.iniae. In February 1996, a Chinese man was admitted to the same hospital with sepsis one week after preparing a fresh whole tilapia, and was also diagnosed with S.iniae bacteremia. A subsequent epidemiological investigation found other cases in the Toronto area, for a total of nine patients; all were of Asian descent and all had handled raw fish (mostly tilapia) before developing infection. Other cases were later identified in the United States and elsewhere in Canada, and have since been reported in Asia (Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore). Asian descent is a common trend in the majority of invasive human cases, but it is unknown whether this is due to inherent differences in immunity or because of cultural differences in the fish preparation which lend themselves to a higher incidence of infection.|$|E
25|$|Steroids may be {{of benefit}} in peritonitis, miliary disease, {{tubercular}} <b>osteomyelitis,</b> TB <b>osteomyelitis,</b> laryngeal TB, lymphadenitis and genitourinary disease, but the evidence is scant and the routine use of steroids cannot be recommended. Steroid treatment in these patients should be considered {{on a case by}} case basis by the attending physician.|$|E
25|$|<b>Osteomyelitis</b> is {{inflammation}} of the bone or bone marrow due to bacterial infection.|$|E
25|$|Reduces {{the risk}} of causing an {{infected}} surgical site with delayed healing (e.g. <b>osteomyelitis</b> or cellulitis).|$|E
25|$|Osteitis {{generally}} {{refers to}} localized inflammation of bone with no progression through marrow spaces (compare with <b>osteomyelitis).</b>|$|E
25|$|Other {{infections that}} classically {{lead to a}} limp include Lyme disease (a {{bacterial}} infection spread by a deer tick) and <b>osteomyelitis</b> (an infection of the bone).|$|E
25|$|Toxic shock {{syndrome}} (TSS) {{is a condition}} caused by bacterial toxins. Symptoms may include fever, rash, skin peeling, and low blood pressure. There may also be symptoms related to the specific underlying infection such as mastitis, <b>osteomyelitis,</b> necrotising fasciitis, or pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|Uncommonly, {{breast and}} gluteal abscesses can occur due to haematogenous and lymphangiomatous spread. Regional bone {{infection}} (BCG <b>osteomyelitis</b> or osteitis) and disseminated BCG infection are rare complications of BCG vaccination, but potentially life-threatening. Systemic antituberculous therapy {{may be helpful}} in severe complications.|$|E
25|$|Rosenthal {{developed}} the bone-marrow disease <b>osteomyelitis,</b> causing him extreme pain. After several operations, Rosenthal recovered enough to attend {{public schools in}} New York City and attend City College. In 1943, at City College, he became the campus correspondent for The New York Times. In 1944, he became a staff reporter.|$|E
25|$|S. aureus is {{a leading}} cause of {{bloodstream}} infections throughout much of the industrialized world. Infection is generally associated with breakages in the skin or mucosal membranes due to surgery, injury, or use of intravascular devices such as catheters, hemodialysis machines, or injected drugs. Once the bacteria have entered the bloodstream, they can infect various organs, causing infective endocarditis, septic arthritis, and <b>osteomyelitis.</b> This disease is particularly prevalent and severe in the very young and very old.|$|E
25|$|In dogs, {{the most}} common symptom of {{coccidioidomycosis}} is a chronic cough, which can be dry or moist. Other symptoms include fever (in approximately 50% of cases), weight loss, anorexia, lethargy, and depression. The disease can disseminate throughout the dog's body, most commonly causing <b>osteomyelitis</b> (infection of the bone marrow), which leads to lameness. Dissemination can cause other symptoms, depending on which organs are infected. If the fungus infects the heart or pericardium, it can cause heart failure and death.|$|E
25|$|Born 29 September 1957, in Knowle, Bristol {{to parents}} Ken and Nancy, Broad {{suffered}} from <b>osteomyelitis</b> {{at the age}} of 15, which delayed his development as a cricketer. His first-class debut came for Gloucestershire in 1979 and he secured a permanent place in the team the following summer. As well as Nottinghamshire, he also played for Orange Free State. Returning to Gloucestershire in 1993, Broad retired {{at the end of the}} 1994 season with a hip injury. He is a past student of St Paul's College, Cheltenham.|$|E
25|$|Typical {{symptoms}} include pain, refusing to walk or bear weight and limping -bruising and deformity are absent. On clinical examination, {{there can be}} warmth and swelling over the fracture area, as well as pain on bending the foot upwards (dorsiflexion). The initial radiographical images may be inconspicuous (a faint oblique line) and often even completely normal. After 1–2 weeks however, callus formation develops. The condition can be mistaken for <b>osteomyelitis,</b> transient synovitis or even child abuse. Contrary to CAST fractures, non-accidental injury typically affect the upper two-thirds or midshaft of the tibia.|$|E
25|$|Pain in {{or around}} the hip and/or limp in {{children}} can {{be due to a}} large number of conditions. Septic arthritis (a bacterial infection of the joint) is the most important differential diagnosis, because it can quickly cause irreversible damage to the hip joint. Fever, raised inflammatory markers on blood tests and severe symptoms (inability to bear weight, pronounced muscle guarding) all point to septic arthritis, but a high index of suspicion remains necessary even if these are not present. <b>Osteomyelitis</b> (infection of the bone tissue) can also cause pain and limp.|$|E
25|$|She {{suffered}} a minor stroke in 1956, and later underwent surgery on her jawbone for <b>osteomyelitis.</b> Twelve {{days after the}} operation, Davies fell in her hospital room and broke her leg. Davies made her last public appearance on January 10, 1960, on an NBC television special called Hedda Hopper's Hollywood. Joseph P. Kennedy rented Davies' mansion and worked from {{behind the scenes to}} secure his son John F. Kennedy's nomination during the 1960 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles. It was not long after that she was diagnosed with stomach cancer.|$|E
25|$|Stage IV: Full {{thickness}} tissue loss with exposed bone, tendon or muscle. Slough or eschar may {{be present}} on {{some parts of the}} wound bed. Often include undermining and tunneling. The depth of a stage IV pressure ulcer varies by anatomical location. The bridge of the nose, ear, occiput and malleolus do not have (adipose) subcutaneous tissue and these ulcers can be shallow. Stage IV ulcers can extend into muscle and/or supporting structures (e.g., fascia, tendon or joint capsule) making <b>osteomyelitis</b> likely to occur. Exposed bone/tendon is visible or directly palpable. In 2012, the NPUAP stated that pressure ulcers with exposed cartilage are also classified as a stage IV.|$|E
25|$|Davis and Merrill {{adopted a}} baby boy, Michael (born January 5, 1952), in 1952, and Davis {{appeared}} in a Broadway revue, Two's Company directed by Jules Dassin. She was uncomfortable working outside of her area of expertise; {{she had never been}} a musical performer and her limited theater experience had been more than 20years earlier. She was also severely ill and was operated on for <b>osteomyelitis</b> of the jaw. Margot was diagnosed as severely brain-damaged due to an injury sustained during or shortly after her birth, and was placed in an institution around the age of 3. Davis and Merrill began arguing frequently, with B.D. later recalling episodes of alcohol abuse and domestic violence.|$|E
25|$|C. rufifacies {{has been}} used {{successfully}} in maggot therapy to treat patients with <b>osteomyelitis,</b> a microbial infection of the bone. C. rufifacies can be a vector for enteric pathogens {{in countries such as}} India and Australia, specifically, if it enters homes due to its attraction to feces, fruits, meats, and refuse. Multiple pathogens such as Bacillus bacteria, roundworms, and pinworms have been recovered from the alimentary canal and feces of C. rufifacies. The late instars of the species are beneficial medically by acting as predators of maggots of pathogen-transmitting and myiasis-producing flies; thus, the larvae can be used as beneficial and effective biological control agents. However, certain strains from Australia, India, and Hawaii have been documented to have instars that are harmful when involved in secondary myiasis.|$|E
25|$|Dry socket {{typically}} causes pain on {{the second}} to fourth day following a dental extraction. Other causes of post extraction pain usually occur immediately after the anesthesia/analgesia has worn off, (e.g., normal pain from surgical trauma or mandibular fracture) or has a more delayed onset (e.g., <b>osteomyelitis,</b> which typically causes pain several weeks following an extraction). Examination typically involves gentle irrigation with warm saline and probing of the socket to establish the diagnosis. Sometimes part of {{the root of the}} tooth or a piece of bone fractures off and is retained in the socket. This can be another cause of pain in a socket, and causes delayed healing. A dental radiograph (x-ray) may be indicated to demonstrate such a suspected fragment.|$|E
25|$|ONJ, {{even in its}} mild or minor forms, {{creates a}} marrow {{environment}} that is conducive to bacterial growth. Since many individuals have low-grade infections of the teeth and gums, this probably {{is one of the}} major mechanisms by which the marrow blood flow problem can worsen; any local infection / inflammation will cause increased pressures and clotting in the area involved. No other bones have this mechanism as a major risk factor for osteonecrosis. A wide variety of bacteria have been cultured from ONJ lesions. Typically, they are the same microorganisms as those found in periodontitis or devitalized teeth. However, according to special staining of biopsied tissues, bacterial elements are rarely found in large numbers. So while ONJ is not primarily an infection, many cases have a secondary, very low-level of bacterial infection and chronic non-suppurative <b>osteomyelitis</b> can be associated with ONJ. Fungal infections in the involved bone do not seem to be a problem, but viral infections have not been studied. Some viruses, such as the smallpox virus (no longer existent in the wild) can produce osteonecrosis.|$|E
25|$|Death during {{hibernation}} was {{a common}} end for cave bears, mainly befalling specimens that failed ecologically during the summer season through inexperience, sickness or old age. Some cave bear bones show signs of numerous ailments, including spinal fusion, bone tumours, cavities, tooth resorption, necrosis (particularly in younger specimens), <b>osteomyelitis,</b> periostitis, rickets and kidney stones. Male cave bear skeletons have been found with broken bacula, probably due to fighting during the breeding season. Cave bear longevity is unknown, though {{it has been estimated}} that they seldom exceeded twenty years of age. Paleontologists doubt adult cave bears had any natural predators, save for pack-hunting wolves and cave hyenas, which would probably have attacked sick or infirm specimens. Cave hyenas are thought to be responsible for the disarticulation and destruction of some cave bear skeletons. Such large carcasses were an optimal food resource for the hyenas, especially at the end of the winter, when food was scarce. The presence of fully articulated adult cave lion skeletons, deep in cave bear dens, indicates the lions may have occasionally entered dens to prey on hibernating cave bears, with some dying in the attempt.|$|E
25|$|Since ONJ {{has been}} {{diagnosed}} in many patients {{who did not}} take bisphosphonates, it is thus logical to assume that bisphosphonates {{are not the only}} factor in ONJ. While the oversuppression of bone turnover seems {{to play a major role}} in aggravating the disease process, other factors can and do initiate the pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for ONJ. In non-bisphosphonate cases of ONJ, it is mainly the cancellous portion of the bone and its marrow content that are involved in the disease process. The first stage is an oedema of the bone marrow initiated by a bone infarct, which is itself modulated by numerous causes, leading to myelofibrosis as a result of hypoxia and gradual loss of mineral bone density characteristic of ischaemic osteoporosis. Further deterioration can be triggered by additional bone infarcts leading to anoxia and a localized areas of osteonecrosis within the osteoporotic cancellous bone. Secondary events such as dental infection, injection of local anaesthetics with vasoconstrictors, such as epinephrine, and trauma can add further complications to the disease process and chronic non-pus forming bone infection <b>osteomyelitis</b> can also be associated with ONJ.|$|E

500|$|It is {{traditionally}} believed that so-called [...] "deep" [...] infections—such as <b>osteomyelitis</b> or infective endocarditis—should {{be treated with}} bactericidal antibiotics, not bacteriostatic ones. Nevertheless, preclinical studies were conducted to assess the efficacy of linezolid for these infections, and the drug has been used successfully to treat them in clinical practice. Linezolid {{appears to be a}} reasonable therapeutic option for infective endocarditis caused by multi-resistant Gram-positive bacteria, despite a lack of high-quality evidence to support this use. Results in the treatment of enterococcal endocarditis have varied, with some cases treated successfully and others not responding to therapy. Low- to medium-quality evidence is also mounting for its use in bone and joint infections, including chronic <b>osteomyelitis,</b> although adverse effects are a significant concern when long-term use is necessary.|$|E
