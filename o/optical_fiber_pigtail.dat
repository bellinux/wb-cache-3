A pigtail {{is similar to}} a patch cord and is the informal name given to a cable fitted with a connector at one end and bare wires (or bare fibre) at the other. In the context of copper cabling, these cables are sometimes referred to as blunt patch cords and the non-connectorized end ("the pigtail") is intended to be permanently attached to a component or terminal. <b>Optical</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>pigtails,</b> in contrast to copper pigtails, can be more accurately described as a connector than a cable or cord. A <b>fiber</b> <b>pigtail</b> is a single, short, usually tight-buffered, <b>optical</b> <b>fiber</b> that has an optical connector pre-installed on one end and a length of exposed fiber at the other end. The end of the <b>fiber</b> <b>pigtail</b> is stripped and fusion spliced to a single fiber of a multi-fiber trunk.
