The levels <b>of</b> <b>incomes</b> redistribution inequality here are measured in monitored Czech hoseholds in the years 2005 until 2007. Calculations comprise analyses of individual types <b>of</b> <b>incomes</b> and items which influence equality of redistribution.

5|$|Although they {{recorded}} {{all income}} {{that came through}} the Exchequer, not all sources <b>of</b> <b>income</b> went through that office, so the Pipe rolls are not a complete record of royal income. They did include both regular income from the royal lands and judicial profits, {{as well as more}} occasional income derived from feudal levies, wardships, and ecclesiastical vacancies. Another source <b>of</b> <b>income</b> recorded in the rolls was from feudal reliefs, the payment made by an heir when inheriting an estate. A major source <b>of</b> <b>income</b> in the roll of 1130 is from the forests, under the Forest Law, which was the royal law covering the restrictions imposed on non-royals hunting in areas of the country declared royal forest. However, royal income from taxation that was not annually assessed was not usually recorded in the Pipe rolls, nor were his receipts from lands outside England. Some payments went directly to the king's household, and because they did not pass through the Exchequer, they were not recorded in the Pipe rolls.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the major}} sources <b>of</b> <b>income</b> in the {{territory}} during the 1850s was U.S. government annuity payments to the Ojibwe and other tribes required by earlier treaties. These payments amounted to more than $380,000 per year on average ($ in present-day terms) compared to approximately $120,000 per year ($ in present-day terms) given to the territory itself for development. Because of corruption, and mishandling of the payments to the tribes, {{a great deal of}} the money was used directly by U.S. settlers for commercial and community development with questionable benefit to the tribes. At the beginning of the Minnesota Territory, in fact, these payments were the territory's most important source <b>of</b> <b>income</b> since the fur trade was no longer as lucrative as it had once been and other exports were still negligible.|$|E

Assuming that the redistribution comes at a cost (because only a fraction <b>of</b> a taxed <b>income</b> can be transferred), we find that there exists a critical level of beta below which different isoelastic social planners choose different optimal allocations <b>of</b> <b>incomes.</b> However, if beta is above that critical level, all isoelastic social planners choose the same allocation <b>of</b> <b>incomes</b> because they then find that an equal distribution <b>of</b> <b>incomes</b> maximizes social welfare regardless {{of the magnitude of}} alpha...|$|R
