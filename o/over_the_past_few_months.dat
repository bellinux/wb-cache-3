5|$|At Massive Dynamic, Brandon (Ryan McDonald) theorizes to {{the team}} that Observers are time travelers, {{as they have been}} {{documented}} during several major events in history. They write in an incomprehensible language, and the number of Observer sightings has increased <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>months,</b> leaving the team wondering why. Meanwhile, August visits the other Observers, who are not happy that he saved a girl who was supposed to die in the plane crash. To correct his mistake, they send Donald Long (Paul Rae), an assassin affiliated with the Observers to correct August's actions. In an attempt to save Christine, August sends a secret message to Walter. During the meeting, August reveals Christine will die because she is not important; Walter tells August that he has to make her important.|$|E

This prompts an {{intervention}} of sorts from Henry's mother, Pauline, who suggests diet pills. When Betty {{goes to the}} doctor's office {{in an attempt to}} obtain diet pills, the doctor refuses. After a routine examination, he finds a possibly cancerous lump in Betty's throat. Betty returns home in a hysteric fever. She calls Don, who reassures her.

500|$|In 2013, Bibel {{criticized the}} soap opera when Victoria [...] "decided {{to give up a}} {{corporate}} career to become a children’s book author", writing: [...] "From the time she was SORASED into a teen, Victoria’s ambition was to run Newman Enterprises. She was the child who inherited Victor’s (Eric Braeden) business acumen. He, being a male chauvinist, always viewed the more family oriented Nick as his heir apparent. Her struggle to get her father’s recognition is what fueled her." [...] She also stated that while watching the series, there was [...] "the sense that women could, if that was what interested them, be power players". Of Victoria's choice to leave Newman Enterprises, Bibel wrote: [...] "For Victoria, it came across as giving up Peggy Olsen’s life for Betty Draper’s. I was also peeved by her telling her mother that she didn’t have the first idea of how to become an author. She ran a major cosmetics company. She should have a hundred contacts in publishing, and the confidence and skills to figure out what she doesn’t know.

[...] KFC also began using Indian spices and cooking techniques to localize its chicken dishes. By 2008–09, KFC operated 34 outlets in India.
