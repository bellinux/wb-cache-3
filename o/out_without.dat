5|$|Experts {{disagree}} {{over whether}} temnospondyls were ancestral to modern amphibians (frogs, salamanders, and caecilians), {{or whether the}} whole group died <b>out</b> <b>without</b> leaving any descendants. Different hypotheses have placed modern amphibians as the descendants of temnospondyls, another group of early tetrapods called lepospondyls, or even as descendants of both groups (with caecilians evolving from lepospondyls and frogs and salamanders evolving from temnospondyls). Recent studies place a family of temnospondyls called the amphibamids as the closest relatives of modern amphibians. Similarities in teeth, skulls, and hearing structures link the two groups.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, {{commercial}} activity {{shifted from the}} major trade routes of the Old World to newer routes between modern nation-states. This activity was sometimes carried <b>out</b> <b>without</b> traditional protection of trade and under international free-trade agreements, which allowed commercial goods to cross borders with relaxed restrictions. Innovative transportation of modern times includes pipeline transport and the relatively well-known trade involving rail routes, automobiles, and cargo airlines.|$|E
5|$|The Court further {{determined}} that states {{could not be}} forced to participate in the Medicaid expansion. ACA withheld all Medicaid funding from states declining to participate in the expansion. The Court ruled that this withdrawal of funding was unconstitutionally coercive and that individual states had the right to opt <b>out</b> <b>without</b> losing preexisting Medicaid funding.|$|E

5|$|The {{prevention}} of oxygen toxicity depends {{entirely on the}} setting. Both underwater and in space, proper precautions can eliminate the most pernicious effects. Premature infants commonly require supplemental oxygen to treat complications of preterm birth. In this case {{prevention of}} bronchopulmonary dysplasia and retinopathy of prematurity must be carried <b>out</b> <b>without</b> compromising a supply of oxygen adequate to preserve the infant's life.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} halted in March 1989, {{for lack of}} funding, after costs had quickly {{escalated}} that January, from £35million to £230million. By this point huge sections of the building's roof had been removed, so that machinery could be taken <b>out.</b> <b>Without</b> a roof, the building's steel framework has been left exposed and its foundations have been prone to flooding.|$|E

5|$|As Japanese {{shelling}} intensifies in Burma, Chandrasekaran and Gnanasekaran {{decide to}} return to India. Chandrasekaran, accompanied by Saraswati, reaches Tiruchi safely and becomes a judge, but Gnanasekaran is lost in the journey and loses a leg in the shelling before arriving in India. He begs for a living, forms an association for beggars and tries to reform them. Kalyani reaches Chandrasekaran's palatial house seeking food, but Chandrasekaran throws her <b>out</b> <b>without</b> recognising her. She later arrives at a temple seeking help, but the pujari (priest) also tries to molest her. Frustrated with life and unable to feed her child, Kalyani throws it into a river and attempts suicide, but is soon arrested for killing the child and brought for trial.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the end of}} the year, Gaveston had {{returned}} to England, and civil war appeared imminent. In May 1312, Gaveston was taken captive by the Earl of Pembroke, but Warwick and Lancaster had him abducted and executed after a mock trial. This affront to Pembroke’s honour drove him irrevocably into the camp of the king, and thereby split the opposition. The brutality of the act initially drove Lancaster and his adherents away from the centre of power, but the Battle of Bannockburn, in June 1314, returned the initiative. Edward was humiliated by his disastrous defeat, while Lancaster and Warwick had not taken part in the campaign, claiming that it was carried <b>out</b> <b>without</b> the consent of the baronage, and as such in defiance of the Ordinances.|$|E
5|$|Casualties of the {{operation}} were not high on either side. British losses in the landing party amounted to 15 killed and 58 wounded, with an additional three missing. The naval squadron suffered no known casualties in the engagement, principally {{because they did not}} come under heavy fire. French losses have not been calculated, but apart from General DesBruslys were probably a similar figure to the British. In contrast, the damage to the morale of the French defenders of Île Bonaparte was severe: the death of DesBruslys and the failure to properly defend the town undermined their efforts {{to such a degree that}} the eventual invasion of the island in 1810 was carried <b>out</b> <b>without</b> significant fighting or loss. This invasion force was similar in size to the raiding party and was once again led by Rowley and Keating.|$|E

5|$|Crompton's damp climate {{provided}} the ideal conditions for cotton spinning {{to be carried}} <b>out</b> <b>without</b> the cotton drying and breaking, and newly developed 19th-century mechanisation optimised cotton spinning for mass production for the global market. When suitable land in nearby Oldham (then {{the largest and most}} productive mill town in the world) had become scarce in the 1860s, there was a mill building boom in Shaw and Crompton, giving rise to the area as major mill town. The local townscape became dominated by distinctive rectangular brick-built mills, and its former villages and hamlets agglomerated as a single town around these factories. Shaw and Crompton railway station and a goods yard was opened in 1863, allowing improved transportation of textile goods and raw materials to and from the township. Neighbouring Royton had begun to encroach upon the township's southern boundary, forming a continuous urban cotton-spinning district with Oldham, Lees and Chadderton—the Oldham parliamentary constituency—which was responsible for 13% of the world's cotton production.|$|E
5|$|During battle, players cast spells {{using an}} {{assigned}} Persona: each spell drains a character's Spell Point meter. Each Persona has different elemental strengths and weaknesses, and different Personas {{can be used}} for defense, healing or elemental attacks. While a Persona is originally quite weak, if it is used enough, it will achieve a higher rank, with Rank 8 being the highest possible. As the Persona's rank is raised, that Persona is able to cast more powerful spells. In addition to individual actions, the player can align characters to trigger a Fusion Spell: when two or more party members use a certain sequence of spells, they will automatically summon multiple Personas to generate a powerful attack. During battles, both characters and Personas earn experience points. The player has the option to activate an Auto-battle option, having combat play <b>out</b> <b>without</b> player interaction.|$|E
5|$|In 1817 Heber {{accepted}} {{the post of}} canon at St Asaph, the relative proximity of which enabled the extra duties to be carried <b>out</b> <b>without</b> interfering with his parish work. His main literary task during these years was a biography and critical study of the complete works of the 17th-century cleric Jeremy Taylor; the works, with Heber's critique, were published in 15 volumes between 1820 and 1822. This period of Heber's life was saddened by the death, on 24 December 1818, of his infant daughter after a short illness. Two more daughters were born later, in 1821 and 1824 respectively; both lived to adulthood. In 1822 Heber {{was elected to the}} church office of Preacher of Lincoln's Inn, which would require a regular term of residence in London. He saw this both as an extension of his service to the Church and as a means of renewing contact with old friends.|$|E

5|$|Larvae of Sirex {{woodwasp}} develop through arrhenotoky: male larvae develop {{only from}} unfertilized eggs, the females only from fertilized ones. Usually, 10 males are produced per female, but the ratio varies between 20:1 and 1:1. The larvae hatch after eight {{days at the}} earliest, but in some exterior conditions, they may remain in the egg for several months. At the optimal temperature of around 25°C (77°F), they hatch out after 10 to 12 days. Although the larvae hatch at 30°C (86°F) {{two to three days}} earlier, they are 20% more likely to die. Such extreme temperatures result in slower development, and below 6.2°C (43°F), the larvae die. A sufficient interspersion of the wood with the mycelium of the woodwasp is crucial for its hatching, as the fungus prevents the wood from drying <b>out.</b> <b>Without</b> these prerequisites, hatching is not possible. The tree can only ward off the infestation if it floods the boreholes with resin or halts the fungus by producing a wall of polyphenols.|$|E

They came back <b>out</b> <b>without</b> buying anything when they realized they did not have money with them and wouldn't have known how to use it even if they did. The next day they asked Chebotareva how to use money.|$|E
5|$|Operation Eagle Pull was the United States {{military}} evacuation by air of Phnom Penh, Cambodia, on 12 April 1975. At {{the beginning}} of April 1975, Phnom Penh, {{one of the last}} remaining strongholds of the Khmer Republic, was surrounded by the Khmer Rouge and totally dependent on aerial resupply through Pochentong Airport. With a Khmer Rouge victory imminent, the US government made contingency plans for the evacuation of US nationals and allied Cambodians by helicopter to ships in the Gulf of Thailand. Operation Eagle Pull took place on the morning of 12 April 1975 and was a tactical success carried <b>out</b> <b>without</b> any loss of life. Five days later the Khmer Republic collapsed and the Khmer Rouge occupied Phnom Penh.|$|E

5|$|Polikarpov {{was arrested}} and imprisoned by the OGPU in September 1929 for the crime of {{industrial}} sabotage when neither the I-6 nor the I-5 projects met their stipulated deadlines, and this delayed the first flight of the I-6 until 30 March 1930. The second prototype was completed shortly thereafter and both aircraft appeared in that year's May Day fly-past over Moscow. Both aircraft likely used imported engines before they were replaced by the Soviet-built copy of the Jupiter, the Shvetsov M-22. One I-6 crashed on 13 June 1930 after the test pilot bailed <b>out,</b> <b>without</b> justification, {{in the opinion of}} the Soviet aviation historian Vadim B. Shavrov.|$|E
5|$|Russia {{had made}} a {{previous}} attempt to capture Viborg; in October 1706, a siege corps was sent there {{under the command of}} Robert (Roman) Bruce. On 22 October, mortars were placed and the bombardment began, which continued for four days and caused five fires in the fort at Viborg. After the bombardment, Russian forces retreated to Saint Petersburg after commanders realized that a siege could not be carried <b>out</b> <b>without</b> naval support and larger cannon. Also, autumn was not considered a suitable time for siege operations. The idea to reattempt a capture of Viborg was first proposed by Peter the Great in 1708, but rejected by the military due to the recent Swedish offensive.|$|E
5|$|Secondary {{causes of}} tics (not related to {{inherited}} Tourette syndrome) are {{commonly referred to}} as tourettism. Dystonias, choreas, other genetic conditions, and secondary causes of tics should be ruled out in the differential diagnosis for Tourette syndrome. Other conditions that may manifest tics or stereotyped movements include developmental disorders, autism spectrum disorders, and stereotypic movement disorder; Sydenham's chorea; idiopathic dystonia; and genetic conditions such as Huntington's disease, neuroacanthocytosis, Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Wilson's disease, and tuberous sclerosis. Other possibilities include chromosomal disorders such as Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, XYY syndrome and fragile X syndrome. Acquired causes of tics include drug-induced tics, head trauma, encephalitis, stroke, and carbon monoxide poisoning. The symptoms of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome may also be confused with Tourette syndrome. Most of these conditions are rarer than tic disorders, and a thorough history and examination may be enough to rule them <b>out,</b> <b>without</b> medical or screening tests.|$|E
