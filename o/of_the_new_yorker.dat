5|$|View of the World from 9th Avenue (sometimes A Parochial New Yorker's View of the World, A New Yorker's View of the World {{or simply}} View of the World) is a 1976 {{illustration}} by Saul Steinberg {{that served as}} the cover of the March 29, 1976, edition <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Yorker.</b> The work presents the view from Manhattan {{of the rest of the}} world showing Manhattan as the center of the world.|$|E
5|$|Early in the film, Hoffman {{explains}} to his superiors that the terrorists' retreat to pre-tech age communication methods renders useless the high specification tools the CIA uses, {{and increases the}} worth of Ferris's human intelligence methods. They avoid mobile telephones and computers, preferring face-to-face communication and encoded written messages. By contrast, the Americans use sophisticated communication (Hoffman and Ferris regularly speak on the phone) and surveillance (high altitude spy planes offer {{a different point of}} view throughout) technology. David Denby <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Yorker</b> said that this was Scott's suggestion that the CIA has the technology but not the human intelligence to properly fight terrorism in the Middle East.|$|E

5|$|In America, {{he again}} tried {{his hand at}} journalism, but a brief stint as editor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Yorker</b> Yiddishe Ilustrirte Zaitung {{resulted}} only in getting the paper suspended and landing himself a rather large fine. On March 31, 1905, he recited poetry at a benefit performance at Cooper Union to raise a pension for Yiddish poet Eliakum Zunser, even worse off than himself because he had found himself unable to write since coming to America in 1889. Shortly afterwards, he met {{a group of young}} people who had a Hebrew language association at the Dr. Herzl Zion Club, and wrote a Hebrew-language play David ba-Milchama (David in the War), which they performed in March 1906, the first Hebrew-language play to be performed in America. Repeat performances in March 1907 and April 1908 drew successively larger crowds.|$|E
5|$|Narayan's writing {{technique}} was unpretentious {{with a natural}} element of humour about it. It focused on ordinary people, reminding the reader of next-door neighbours, cousins and the like, thereby providing a greater ability {{to relate to the}} topic. Unlike his national contemporaries, he was able to write about the intricacies of Indian society without having to modify his characteristic simplicity to conform to trends and fashions in fiction writing. He also employed the use of nuanced dialogic prose with gentle Tamil overtones based on the nature of his characters. Critics have considered Narayan to be the Indian Chekhov, due to the similarities in their writings, the simplicity and the gentle beauty and humour in tragic situations. Greene considered Narayan to be more similar to Chekhov than any Indian writer. Anthony West <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Yorker</b> considered Narayan's writings to be of the realism variety of Nikolai Gogol.|$|E
5|$|With the {{emergence}} <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Yorker,</b> Benchley {{was able to}} stay away from Hollywood work for a number of years. In 1931, he was persuaded to do voice work for RKO Radio Pictures for a film that would eventually be titled Sky Devils, and he acted in his first feature film, The Sport Parade (1932) with Joel McCrea. The work on The Sport Parade caused Benchley to miss the fall theatre openings, which embarrassed him (even if the relative success of The Sport Parade was often credited to Benchley's role), but the lure of filmmaking did not disappear, since RKO offered him a writing and acting contract for the following year for more money than he was making writing for The New Yorker.|$|E

5|$|A general {{perception}} on Narayan {{was that}} he did not involve himself or his writings with the politics or problems of India, as mentioned by V. S. Naipaul in one of his columns. However, according to Wyatt Mason <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Yorker,</b> although Narayan's writings seem simple and display a lack of interest in politics, he delivers his narrative with an artful and deceptive technique when dealing with such subjects and does not entirely avoid them, rather letting the words play in the reader's mind. Srinivasa Iyengar, former vice-chancellor of Andhra University, says that Narayan wrote about political topics only in the context of his subjects, quite unlike his compatriot Mulk Raj Anand who dealt with the political structures and problems of the time. Paul Brians, in his book Modern South Asian Literature in English, says that the fact that Narayan completely ignored British rule and focused on the private lives of his characters is a political statement on its own, declaring his independence from the influence of colonialism.|$|E
5|$|Peter, Joe, Cleveland, and Quagmire win {{a costume}} contest as {{characters}} from The A-Team (because {{they had an}} actual black guy as B. A.

When Peter and his friends win the costume contest, Brian writes a report about it, and is later telephoned by a member <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Yorker,</b> who tell him they would like him to work for their magazine. Brian is initially given a warm welcome by the staff, but he is immediately fired after he informs them he never graduated from college.

25|$|In 1925, Thurber {{moved to}} Greenwich Village in New York City, {{getting a job}} as a {{reporter}} for the New York Evening Post. He joined the staff <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Yorker</b> in 1927 as an editor, with the help of E.B. White, his friend and fellow New Yorker contributor. His career as a cartoonist began in 1930 after White found some of Thurber's drawings in a trash can and submitted them for publication; White inked-in some of these earlier drawings to make them reproduce better for the magazine, and years later expressed deep regret that he had done such a thing. Thurber contributed both his writings and his drawings to The New Yorker until the 1950s.|$|E
