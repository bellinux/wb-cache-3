In this paper, {{a series of tests}} on a rigid model monopile, subjected to lateral cyclic loading, were carried out in Qiantang River silt to investigate the pile-soil interaction mechanism and accumulated deformation. The tests revealed that the accumulated displacement is closely related to the <b>cyclic</b> load <b>ratio</b> but has no obvious relationship with the relative density of the soil. In contrast, the unloading stiffness is independent of the <b>cyclic</b> <b>ratio</b> but is related to the relative density of the soil. The soil around the rigid monopile under cyclic loading undergoes a shearing stage during the first ten cycles, followed by the densification stage. The shearing stage dominates the cyclic responses of the rigid monopile, within which the total displacement in each cycle reduced obviously; the proportion of the elastic displacement to the total displacement for each cycle increases from ~ 0. 5 to 0. 95, and the soil pressures degrade to a large extent...|$|R

40|$|Railways have {{technical}} and economic advantages, and therefore, railway traffic {{has gained a}} specific and irreplaceable position in recent years. With this background, and to satisfy their rapid development, railways will inevitably be constructed on soft soil subgrade such as soft clay subgrade. It is desired to understand the behaviour of soft clay subgrade subjected to cyclic loads when a new rail track is designed or an existing one is under maintenance. When the soft clay subgrade is subjected to the cyclic loading, excess pore pressures and axial strains keep developing with {{the increasing number of}} cycles, resulting in a decreased bearing capacity of the subgrade and excessive settlement. To improve the subgrade, prefabricated vertical band drains (PVDs) is used increasingly in popularity among a variety of techniques. With the installation of PVDs, a short radial drainage path is introduced to dissipate the excess pore pressure so that the soft clay subgrade becomes more stable subjected to train loads. This thesis covers the laboratory tests and numerical modelling. The behaviour of soft clays under cyclic loading with or without radial drainage is investigated. A series of undrained cyclic triaxial tests were conducted on specimens of reconstituted Kaolinite. Three <b>cyclic</b> stress <b>ratios</b> and four loading frequencies were used in the laboratory tests to study the performance of soft subgrade soil subjected to cyclic loading. The effects of <b>cyclic</b> stress <b>ratio</b> and loading frequency on the generation of excess pore pressures and axial strains were investigated. The roles of <b>cyclic</b> stress <b>ratio</b> and loading frequency play in influencing the stability of soft clay subgrade were discussed. The effect of strain rate for a stress controlled test on the performance of soft clays under cyclic loading was investigated. The relationship between the strain rate and either <b>cyclic</b> stress <b>ratio</b> or loading frequency were figured out, and in this way, the influence of <b>cyclic</b> stress <b>ratio</b> and loading frequency on the progressive shear failure and excessive plastic deformation were justified.

This note describes laboratory experiments on K 0 -consolidated intact samples of soft clay taken near Wenzhou, south-east China, that explore whether cyclic traffic wheel loading contributes significantly to the observed settlement trends. Cyclic triaxial (CT) tests are reported together with cyclic hollow cylinder (CHCA) experiments that imposed cardioid-shaped 2 τzθ − (Δσz − Δσθ) stress paths.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} the influence of welding residual stresses (RS) on fatigue crack propagation rate (FCPR) in mode I. The objective of this work is to develop a novel methodology that allows a variation of a RS field in the studied specimen while keeping constant all other variables influencing FCPR. This {{led to the development of}} a novel specimen geometry, named CT-RES, in which RS are introduced by weld bead deposition far from the region in which fatigue crack propagation (FCP) occurs. As a consequence, the effect of factors influencing FCPR other than RS such as microstructural changes or plastic deformation, often introduced by welding processes, can be avoided. The welding RS introduced in the CT-RES specimen were determined by the contour method and the weight functions method was used to calculate the stress intensity factor (SIF), Kres, resulting from the RS as the fatigue crack propagates into the specimen. The evolution of <b>cyclic</b> stress <b>ratio</b> at the crack tip, Rlocal, was then computed from Kres to quantify the influence of RS on the <b>cyclic</b> stress <b>ratio.</b> The results show that for a given stress intensity range, dK, the FCPR of the welded geometry with fixed externally low R ratio (R = 0. 1), but constantly increasing Rlocal, is the same as for the as-machined geometry without RS, solicited at high <b>cyclic</b> stress <b>ratio</b> (R = 0. 7).

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a new method for a retro-estimation {{of the stress}} amplitude, the <b>cyclic</b> <b>ratio</b> {{and the number of}} cycles to failure from the fracture morphology of failed structural components. The method is based on a previously proposed procedure using a new relation enabling to describe the whole range of the long crack growth. The method is suitable for quantitative assessment of fatigue loading parameters and the number of cycles spent during the stable propagation. The following materials and fracture parameters are to be known: the v-K curve for the component material, mean projective striation spacing at least for one crack length and the location of the stable-unstable crack growth transition on the fracture surface. The shape functions of stress intensity factors related to decisive fatigue crack growth stages are to be anticipated as well. The application possibilities of the method are demonstrated in a case study concerning the fatigue failure of a compressor blade made from Ti- 4 Al- 3 Mo- 1. 5 Zr high-strength alloy. Under the assumption of a nearly constant amplitude of applied loading, the analysis yielded the stress range ∆σ ≈ 550 MPa, <b>cyclic</b> <b>ratio</b> R ≈ 0. 3 and the number of cycles Nc ≈ 106 to propagate the initial 0. 5 mm crack to its critical distance of 17 mm.

The method can be also applied in case where a stationary random loading is to be expected. A special software package was also developed for university courses in applied fracture mechanics. ...|$|R

We evaluated the ability of cyclic irrigation to reduce the suspended solids load from paddy fields. In 2006 and 2007, we investigated water and mass balances during the irrigation period in a low-lying paddy-field district neighboring Lake Biwa, which is the largest lake in Japan. We confirmed that cyclic irrigation reduced effluent loads during the puddling season. With cyclic irrigation, 118 kg ha− 1 of suspended solids was returned to the paddy fields in 2006 and 199 kg ha− 1 in 2007. The effect of cyclic irrigation on the net suspended solids load can be represented by three ratios: the concentration ratio, which represents the ratio of the suspended solids concentration in drainage water to that in lake water; the <b>cyclic</b> irrigation <b>ratio,</b> which represents the ratio of the volume of reused water to that of irrigation water in cyclic irrigation; and the surplus irrigation water ratio, which represents the ratio of the volume of surplus irrigation water to that of irrigation water.
