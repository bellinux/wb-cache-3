5|$|Chandler's mentor Harry F. Byrd led a {{group of}} Southern conservatives in the Senate, and through Byrd's influence, Chandler was {{appointed}} to the Committee on Military Affairs. In 1943, he was part of a five-person delegation from the Military Affairs Committee that traveled the world, inspecting U.S. military bases. He vociferously disagreed with Roosevelt's decision to prioritize European operations in World War II <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> in the Pacific.|$|E

5|$|Contrary to its {{misleading}} title, the Manifesto of the Sixteen {{had originally}} fifteen signatories—among them {{some of the}} most eminent anarchists in Europe—and was later countersigned by another hundred. The position of the Manifesto was in stark contrast to that of most anarchists of the day, many of whom denounced its signatories and their sympathizers, and accused them of betraying anarchist principles. In the fallout <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> Kropotkin became increasingly isolated, with many former friends cutting their ties to him. The Russian anarchist movement was split into two, with a faction supporting Kropotkin's position to the strong criticism of the Bolsheviks. Elsewhere in Europe, including in the Spanish and Swiss anarchist movements, the dismissal of the Manifesto was overwhelming, with supporters being angrily denounced and marginalized.|$|E
5|$|The Red Guards {{executed}} the Whites of economic/social power, including politicians, major landowners, industrialists, police officers, civil servants, {{teachers and}} leaders {{and members of}} the White Guards. Ten priests of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland and 90 moderate socialists were also killed. The level of executions varied <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> months; the numbers peaked in February during the period of securing the power. March saw low counts because the Reds could never seize new areas outside Red Finland. The numbers rose again in April as the Reds aimed to leave Finland. The two major terror centres were Toijala and Kouvola; 300–350 Whites were executed between February and April 1918.|$|E

25|$|As the war progressed, the {{government}} and the communists were able to exploit their access to Soviet arms to restore government control <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> effort, through diplomacy and force. Anarchists and the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (Partido Obrero de Unificación Marxista, POUM) were integrated into the regular army, albeit with resistance. The POUM Trotskyists were outlawed and falsely denounced as an instrument of the fascists. In the May Days of 1937, many thousands of anarchist and communist Republican soldiers fought for control of strategic points in Barcelona.|$|E
