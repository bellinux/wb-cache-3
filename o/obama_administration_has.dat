25|$|In {{fiscal year}} 2008, the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) {{appropriated}} over $655 million for long-term services provided to refugees after their {{arrival in the}} US. The <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> kept to about the same level.|$|E
25|$|This {{technique}} of enforcement {{is much less}} disruptive than mass raids at workplaces. The <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> pointed out {{that they do not}} follow the Bush administration pattern of raids with a mass roundup of workers. That method had been criticized for disrupting businesses, and breaking up immigrant families.|$|E
50|$|As {{of early}} June 2009, the Bush and <b>Obama</b> <b>administrations</b> <b>had</b> {{invested}} $80.3 billion.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> {{requested}} {{to create a}} Climate Service within NOAA, similar to the National Weather Service. This request was not enacted.|$|R
50|$|Since 2010, U.S. {{legislation}} on illegal immigration has been reinforced, as several American states criminalized illegal immigration. Deportations under the <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> <b>have</b> reached record numbers.|$|R
25|$|Romney had {{previously}} expressed opposition to federal aid {{for renewable energy}} development, and his August 2012 energy policy plan proposed eliminating government support {{in the form of}} loan guarantees and subsidies for development of renewable types of energy, sources of energy that Romney had said the <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> been over-reliant on.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> {{increased}} {{scrutiny of}} the provision of credit to poor and African American neighbourhoods. Lenders have come under investigation for not operating in such areas, whether they have halted service there or have never operated in them before. Former Atlantic associate editor Daniel Indiviglio attributes increasing noncompliance with the CRA to the tightening of lending requirements.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Obama</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>has</b> {{promised to}} take {{specific}} action towards mitigation of climate change. In addition, at state and local levels, there are currently a number of initiatives. As of March 11, 2007, mayors of 418 US cities in 50 states have endorsed the Kyoto protocol, after Mayor Greg Nickels of Seattle started a nationwide effort to get cities {{to agree to the}} protocol. As of January 18, 2007, eight Northeastern US states are involved in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a state level emissions capping and trading program.|$|E
5000|$|Republicans {{argued that}} the bill was {{necessary}} {{to be fair to}} individual Americans, since the <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> already delayed the penalties that would have applied to businesses.|$|R
50|$|That same day, the Department of Justice {{argued in}} court that federal civil rights law does not ban {{employers}} from discriminating against employees based on sexual orientation. The <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> decided that it did.|$|R
50|$|Economists {{debate the}} {{relative}} merit {{of tax cuts}} vs. spending increases as economic stimulus. Economists in President <b>Obama's</b> <b>administration</b> <b>have</b> argued that spending on infrastructure such as roads and bridges has a higher impact on GDP and jobs than tax cuts.|$|R
25|$|In November 2014 U.S. President Obama {{expanded}} the original role of U.S. Armed Forces in Afghanistan for 2015. Originally {{they were supposed}} to advise, train and assist the Afghan Forces and to hunt the remnants of Al Qaeda. Under the president’s order U.S. forces can carry out missions against the Taliban and other militant groups threatening American troops or the Afghan government while American jets, bombers and drones can support Afghan troops on combat missions. By the end of 2015, half of the 9,800 American troops would leave Afghanistan. The rest would be consolidated in Kabul and Bagram, and then leave by the end of 2016, allowing Obama to say he ended the Afghan war before leaving office. The United States could still have military advisers in Kabul after 2016 who would work out of an office of security cooperation at the United States Embassy. But the <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> not said how large that contingent might be and what its exact mission would be.|$|E
500|$|To combat state-approved medical {{cannabis}} legislation, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) routinely {{targets and}} arrests medical cannabis patients {{as well as}} seizing medical cannabis and the business assets of growers and medical dispensaries. [...] However, the <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> indicated that this practice may potentially be curtailed.|$|E
2500|$|Whilst the <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> {{tried to}} {{distance}} itself {{from some of}} the harshest counterterrorism techniques, it has also said that at least some forms of renditions will continue. The administration continued to allow rendition only [...] "to a country with jurisdiction over that individual (for prosecution of that individual)" [...] when there is a diplomatic assurance [...] "that they will not be treated inhumanely." ...|$|E
2500|$|On November 26, 2009, in an {{interview}} with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, President Hamid Karzai said there is an [...] "urgent need" [...] for negotiations with the Taliban, and {{made it clear that the}} <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> opposed such talks. There was no formal American response.|$|R
5000|$|On 26 November 2009, Karzai made {{a public}} plea for direct {{negotiations}} with the Taliban leadership. Karzai said there is an [...] "urgent need" [...] for negotiations and {{made it clear that}} the <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> opposed such talks. There was no formal U.S. response.|$|R
5000|$|While [...] "critics may {{worry that}} {{governance}} by social media will cheapen {{the power of}} the presidency by substituting hashtag activism for serious policymaking," [...] President <b>Obama's</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>has</b> been credited with successfully [...] "leveraging the opportunities of the digital age to maximum political advantage".|$|R
2500|$|According to many experts, the <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> {{relied on}} the CIA and their {{paramilitary}} capabilities, even more than they have on U.S. military forces, to maintain the fight against terrorists in the Afghanistan and Pakistan region, as well as places like Yemen, Somalia and North Africa. [...] Ronald Kessler states in his book The CIA at War: Inside the Secret War Against Terror, that although paramilitary operations are a strain on resources, they’re winning the war against terrorism.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> {{changed the}} stance of the United States {{regarding}} the proposed United Nations treaty on trade in small arms from strong opposition to {{support for the}} treaty if it is passed by [...] "consensus." [...] According to recent deliberations regarding the treaty, signatory countries {{would be required to}} adopt [...] "international standards for the import, export and transfer of conventional arms" [...] in order [...] "to prevent the diversion of conventional arms from ...|$|E
2500|$|As of 2010, {{there were}} 678 {{authorized}} district court judgeships. A study {{put forth by}} Brennan Center for Justice at New York University of Law found that under the Obama administration {{and especially in the}} year 2009 there have been a [...] "uniquely high" [...] number of vacancies in Federal Court, averaging 60 or more from the years 2009 to 2013. The <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> blamed Senate Republicans for opposing (and therefore, not confirming) presidential nominations, while the Republicans say Obama has been slow to nominate.|$|E
50|$|During the 2012 United States presidential {{election}} it began a media campaign asserting that leaks of sensitive {{information from the}} <b>Obama</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>have</b> endangered U.S. personnel and compromised national security, and that Barack Obama has taken too much credit {{for the death of}} Osama bin Laden.|$|R
50|$|In May 2008, {{five of the}} Arctic nations {{adopted the}} Illulissat Declaration which {{incorporates}} the 'law of the sea'.

2500|$|In May 2017, the Republican {{chairman}} of Senate Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism Lindsey Graham invited Rice {{to testify before}} his subcommittee whether the <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> tried to [...] "politicize intelligence".

2500|$|In November 2009, Palin {{expressed}} {{her support}} {{for the expansion of}} Israeli settlements in Palestinian territories, a position contrary to that of every U.S. Presidential administration in the past 40 years. In an interview with Barbara Walters, Palin stated, [...] "I believe that the Jewish settlements should be allowed to be expanded upon, because that population of Israel is going to grow. More and more Jewish people will be flocking to Israel {{in the days and weeks}} and months ahead. And I don't think that the <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> any right to tell Israel that the Jewish settlements cannot expand." ...|$|E
2500|$|This bill {{came after}} a handful of foreign {{countries}} made similar moves in recent years including Egypt, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and others, and after, according to Cruz, recent evidence emerged suggesting that the group supports terrorism. The senator further alleged that the group’s stated goal is to wage violent jihad against its enemies, which includes the United States, {{and the fact that}} the <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> listed numerous group members on its terror list. Cruz further stated that the bill would [...] "reject the fantasy that [...] parent institution [...] is a political entity that is somehow separate from these violent activities".|$|E
2500|$|Deeming {{himself to}} be “non-partisan” in his critiques of policy, Anderson has {{subsequently}} gone on to fiercely criticize the Obama Administration in numerous areas, alleging that in certain respects its record is worse {{than that of the}} Bush Administration. [...] For instance, he has stated::"I don't know what people were expecting, all this hope and change nonsense... There's no question that we're seeing a continuation , and even in some instances a worsening of our republic under this administration. The <b>Obama</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>has</b> contended that no documents stamped as secret by a government agent should ever be allowed into evidence by our courts. That even goes beyond what the Bush Administration did." ...|$|E
5000|$|At this point, The Jerusalem Post {{reported}} that the <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> requested US$500 million from the US Congress {{to use in the}} training and arming of [...] "moderate" [...] Syrian rebels fighting against the Syrian government, in order to counter the growing threat posed by ISIS in Syria and Iraq.|$|R

5000|$|In an {{interview}} on NBC on 8 June, US President Barack Obama said that Hayward [...] "wouldn't be working for me after any of those statements", referring to the remarks Hayward made following the spill.

2500|$|On {{the foreign}} policy of the Obama administration, Glover said: [...] "I think the <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> {{followed}} the same playbook, to a large extent, almost verbatim, as the Bush administration. I don't see anything different... On the domestic side, look here: What's so clear is that this country from the outset is projecting the interests of wealth and property. Look at the bailout of Wall Street. Why not the bailout of Main Street? He may be just a different face, and that face may happen to be black, {{and if it were}} Hillary Clinton, it would happen to be a woman.... But what choices do they have within the structure?" ...|$|E
2500|$|After the September 11, 2001 attacks, this uproar {{escalated}} {{and lead}} to active uptake of surveillance activities. The Patriot Act {{was passed by the}} Congress to strengthen security, and thus, granted the President broad powers on the war against terror, which included the power to bypass the FISA Court for surveillance orders. Mass surveillance activities were conducted alongside various other surveillance programs under the head of President's Surveillance Program. [...] The NSA was authorised to monitor phone calls, internet activity, and messaging between people, without a warrant. Due to pressure from the public, the warrantless wiretapping program was allegedly ceased in January 2007 and the review of surveillance was returned to the FISA Court. However, the <b>Obama</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>has</b> alleged to have continued the surveillance.|$|E
2500|$|On July 13, 2006, Joseph and Valerie Wilson filed a {{civil lawsuit}} against Libby, Dick Cheney, Karl Rove, and other unnamed senior White House {{officials}} (among whom they later added Richard Armitage) for {{their role in the}} public disclosure of Valerie Wilson's classified CIA status. [...] Judge John D. Bates dismissed the Wilsons' lawsuit on jurisdictional grounds on July 19, 2007. [...] The Wilsons appealed Bates's district-court decision the next day. Agreeing with the Bush administration, the Obama Justice Department argued that the Wilsons had no legitimate grounds to sue. Melanie Sloan, one of the Wilsons' attorneys, said: [...] "We are deeply disappointed that the <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> failed to recognize the grievous harm top Bush White House officials inflicted on Joe and Valerie Wilson. The government’s position cannot be reconciled with President Obama's oft-stated commitment to once again make government officials accountable for their actions." ...|$|E
50|$|Chaffetz opposes net neutrality, the {{principle}} that Internet service providers {{should not be allowed}} to discriminate or charge differentially by user, content, website or platform. In March 2015, he held hearings as to whether the <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> secretly influenced the Federal Communications Commission when it adopted rules to ensure net neutrality.|$|R
5000|$|In July 2014, American Freedom Law Center v. Obama, et al. {{was filed}} by the American Freedom Law Center, which {{challenged}} that the <b>Obama</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>had</b> violated its constitutional duty to [...] "faithfully execute" [...] the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. On May 15, 2015, the court dismissed the lawsuit for lack of standing.|$|R
50|$|In June 2015, the <b>Obama</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> {{permitted}} {{the export of}} sweet, light oil for the import of heavy, sour oil from Mexico. Environmental groups have opposed lifting the ban because it would mean more oil sales, more drilling and more oil production with all its environmental impacts, increasing {{emissions of carbon dioxide}} and other pollutants.|$|R
