A synergistic mediation mechanism of citrate ions and Cl- to form boehmite hollow spheres via self-assembly morphology evolution was proposed based on the experimental results. Interestingly, the typical boehmite hollow microspheres with a surface area of 102 m(2) g(- 1), pore volume of 0. 37 cm(3) g(- 1), and the average pore size of 14. 6 nm show superb adsorption properties for Congo red with maximum capacity of 114. 7 mg g(- 1) which is higher than that of a commercial boehmite.

40|$|Purpose: To {{assess whether}} contrast-enhanced T 1 -weighted MR Cholangiography may provide {{additional}} {{information in the}} evaluation of biliary complications in orthotopic liver transplant recipients. Material and methods: Eighty liver transplant patients with suspicion of biliary adverse events underwent MR imaging at 1. 5  T scanner. After acquisition of axial T 1 -/T 2 -weighted images and conventional T 2 -weighted MR Cholangiography (image set 1), 3 D gradient-echo T 1 -weighted fat-suppressed LAVA (Liver Acquisition with Volume Acceleration) sequences were obtained about 30  min after intravenous infusion <b>of</b> mangafodipir <b>trisodium</b> (Mn-DPDP,Teslascan®) (image set 2). The diagnostic value of mangafodipir trisodium-enhanced MR Cholangiography in the detection of biliary complications was tested by separate analysis results of image set 1 alone and image set 1 and 2 together. MRI results were correlated with direct cholangiography in 46 patients, surgery in 14 and/or clinical-radiological follow-up in the remaining 20 cases. Results: The level of confidence in the assessment of biliary adverse events was significantly increased by the administration <b>of</b> mangafodipir <b>trisodium</b> (p <  0. 05). Particularly, contrast-enhanced T 1 -weighted LAVA sequences tended to out-perform conventional T 2 -weighted MR Cholangiography in the delineation of anastomotic and non-anastomotic biliary strictures and in the diagnosis of biliary leak. Conclusions: Contrast-enhanced T 1 -weighted MR Cholangiography may improve the level of diagnostic confidence provided by conventional T 2 -weighted MR Cholangiography {{in the evaluation of}} biliary complications after orthotopic liver transplantation...|$|R

30|$|Discussion This study {{pinpoints}} three interesting findings. First, it is {{well known}} that hypernatremic metabolic alkalosis may occur under CBA-CRRT in case <b>of</b> using <b>trisodium</b> citrate, which contains a high sodium load (408  mmol/L) as compared to 18 / 0 citrate (140  mmol/L of sodium), but the mild risk of alkalosis due to hypochloremia using dilute citrate (86  mmol/L in 18 / 0) is mostly unrecognized. However, no patient presented severe metabolic alkalosis, but natremia was significantly higher in group A and chloremia lower in group B. Second, hypophosphoremia rate, which has been diagnosed in as many as 65  % of the patients undergoing CRRT when using dialysis or replacement solutions without phosphate, is effectively decreased by using phosphate containing solutions. Finally, attention must be drawn on the high proportion of hypomagnesaemia, even if dialysis and replacement solutions contain magnesium, as citrate creates complex with magnesium as well as calcium.|$|R
