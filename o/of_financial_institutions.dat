In this paper, we will show that bubbles can improve the macro performance even if the quality <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> in- stitution is very poor and the financial market does not work well. In this sense, the high quality <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>institution</b> and bubbles are substitutes. We will explore, however, that they are not perfect substi- tutes. Bubbles may burst. If bubbles burst, the economic performance must go down if the quality <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>institution</b> is low. Hence, we will show that not relaying on bubbles, but improving the quality <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>institution</b> is important for long run macro performance. ...|$|R

25|$|Haitian {{politics}} have been contentious: since independence, Haiti has suffered 32 coups. Haiti {{is the only}} country in the Western Hemisphere to undergo a successful slave revolution, but a long history of oppression by dictators—including François Duvalier and his son Jean-Claude Duvalier—has markedly affected the nation. France, the United States and other Western countries have repeatedly intervened in Haitian politics since the country's founding, sometimes at the request of one party or another. Along with international financial institutions, they have imposed large quantities of debt. Haiti has so much foreign debt that payments have rivaled the available government budget for social sector spending. There have been criticisms <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> for enforcing trade policies on Haiti, which are considered by some to be detrimental to local industry.|$|E
25|$|Concerns at {{the time}} over the 1995 {{regulatory}} change causing {{an increase in the}} inability <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> to expand through mergers or acquisition due to regulatory denial based on poor CRA compliance were unfounded. Over the 1993-97 period, one regulatory agency, the Federal Reserve Board, actually approved more applications than the average percentages of those without a detailed CRA review taking place. Of the 1,100 merger or acquisition cases the FRB reviewed on average per year where the relevant institutions were subject to CRA, only 70 instances on average were identified with potential CRA problems regardless of public opposition or internal reporting raising the concern. On average, 22 of these were ultimately identified as CRA compliance being the primary reason for both application withdrawal or FRB denial.|$|E

25|$|Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac {{were allowed}} to hold less capital than normal {{financial}} institutions: e.g., they {{were allowed to}} sell mortgage-backed securities with only half as much capital backing them up as would be required of other financial institutions. Regulations exist through the FDIC Bank Holding Company Act that govern the solvency <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>institutions.</b> The regulations require normal financial institutions to maintain a capital/asset ratio {{greater than or equal to}} 3%. The GSEs, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are exempt from this capital/asset ratio requirement and can, and often do, maintain a capital/asset ratio less than 3%. The additional leverage allows for greater returns in good times, but put the companies at greater risk in bad times, such as during the subprime mortgage crisis. FNMA is not exempt from state and local taxes. In addition, FNMA and FHLMC are exempt from SEC filing requirements; they file SEC 10-K and 10-Q reports, but many other reports, such as certain reports regarding their REMIC mortgage securities, are not filed.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, as {{a result}} of social workers' {{training}} in counseling and their experience in helping their clients with accessing benefits such as unemployment insurance and disability benefits, they are particularly well-suited to help individuals and families learn how to become financially self-sufficient. That said, {{there is a need for}} additional training vis a vis social workers in the financial household management arena. Under some conditions, a raise may trigger reductions in several benefits; therefore, it would be beneficial for social workers to study a financial education curriculum tailored for social workers such as financial social work to fully understand and explain the possible ramifications to clients. In addition, social workers often work with low-income or low to middle-income people who are either unbanked (do not have a banking account) or underbanked (individuals who have a bank account but tend to rely on high cost non-bank providers for their financial transactions). Social workers who have an understanding <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> would be able to guide individuals and families to use mainstream financial institutions and thereby hold onto more of their income and spend less on high cost non-bank financial services.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the issues}} arising from {{unsolicited}} phone marketing is the dealing in individuals' personal information, ie. financial institutions selling personal information, balances and transaction information to third parties. However financial services companies, those that offer both banking, insurance, and investment products, say that the issue and attempted legislation on the topic was caused by smaller financial institutions who simply focused on one type of product or business. The {{reason for this is}} that combining all those products with one company creates a Walmart-style economies of scale and other synergies which are difficult to compete against as a single product line company. By putting forth legislation which forbids financial institutions from sharing information with other companies, single-product-line financial institutions could cripple integrated financial services companies because of the technicality that the banking, investments, and insurance parts of the business had to be operated under separate company affiliates within a holding company. Most financial services companies claim that they have never sold information to non-financial services companies. Some critics <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> agreed with this analysis but continued to press for the legislation because they believed that the financial services integrated business model was fundamentally wrong; however the vast majority of critical articles focused on the issue of selling information to outside telemarketers.|$|E
