5|$|Politics in Texas {{during the}} early 1900s was defined by a spirit of Progressivism. Oil money funded the {{expansion}} of the highway system and the educational system. In general, however, the attitude toward business was laissez-faire. There were few regulations <b>on</b> <b>issues</b> <b>such</b> as minimum wages and child labor.|$|E
5|$|A further type of {{committee}} is normally {{set up to}} scrutinise private bills submitted to the Scottish Parliament by an outside party or promoter {{who is not a}} member of the Scottish Parliament or Scottish Government. Private bills normally relate to large-scale development projects such as infrastructure projects that require the use of land or property. Private Bill Committees have been set up to consider legislation <b>on</b> <b>issues</b> <b>such</b> as the development of the Edinburgh Tram Network, the Glasgow Airport Rail Link, the Airdrie-Bathgate Rail Link and extensions to the National Gallery of Scotland.|$|E

5|$|Based upon another {{recommendation}} from Cabranes, Sotomayor {{was a member}} of the board of directors of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund from 1980 to 1992. There she was a top policy maker who worked actively with the organization's lawyers <b>on</b> <b>issues</b> <b>such</b> as New York City hiring practices, police brutality, the death penalty, and voting rights. The group achieved its most visible triumph when it successfully blocked a city primary election on the grounds that New York City Council boundaries diminished the power of minority voters.|$|E
5|$|Labour {{have also}} {{increased}} their support at other by-elections. At the 2013 Aberdeen Donside by-election in June, held {{after the death}} of the SNP's Brian Adam, Labour reduced the SNP majority from 7,789 to 2,025. The 2014 Cowdenbeath by-election was held following the death of Labour MSP Helen Eadie. The campaign was fought <b>on</b> <b>issues</b> <b>such</b> as education, employment and care for the elderly, and saw Labour increase their share of the vote, with an 11.25 percent swing from the SNP and a majority of 5,488.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many people}} of his generation, Ochs deeply admired President John F. Kennedy, even though he {{disagreed}} with the president <b>on</b> <b>issues</b> <b>such</b> as the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the growing involvement of the United States in the Vietnamese civil war. When Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, Ochs wept. He told his wife {{that he thought he}} was going to die that night. It was the only time she ever saw Ochs cry.|$|E

5|$|Several highly {{acclaimed}} {{editions of}} Schubert's last sonatas are available, namely those of Bärenreiter, Henle, Universal, and Oxford University Press. These editions have, however, occasionally received some criticism {{for the wrong}} interpretation or notation of Schubert's intentions, <b>on</b> <b>issues</b> <b>such</b> as deciphering the correct pitches from the manuscript, notating tremoli, discriminating between accent and decrescendo markings, and reconstructing missing bars.|$|E
5|$|His final {{re-election}} campaign came in 1990 against businessman Harry Lonsdale. Lonsdale aggressively went after Hatfield with television attack ads that attacked Hatfield {{as out of}} touch <b>on</b> <b>issues</b> <b>such</b> as abortion and timber management and accused the incumbent of being too closely allied with special interest groups in Washington. Lonsdale's tactics moved him even with, and then ahead of Hatfield in some polls. Hatfield, who had typically stayed above the fray of negative campaigning, was forced to respond in kind with attack ads of his own. He raised $1million in a single month after trailing Lonsdale in the polls before the November election. He defeated the Democrat with 590,095 (53.7percent) votes to 507,743 (46.2percent) votes.|$|E
5|$|The Philippines values its {{relations}} with the United States. It supported the United States during the Cold War and the War on Terror and is a major non-NATO ally. Despite this history of goodwill, controversies related to the presence of the now former U.S. military bases in Subic Bay and Clark and the current Visiting Forces Agreement have flared up from time to time. Japan, the biggest contributor of official development assistance to the country, is thought of as a friend. Although historical tensions still exist <b>on</b> <b>issues</b> <b>such</b> as the plight of comfort women, much of the animosity inspired by memories of World War II has faded.|$|E

But in retirement, he continued to speak out <b>on</b> <b>issues</b> <b>such</b> as the war in Iraq, death penalty and gay rights. Although a staunch Democrat, Smith did support one of his former players, Richard Vinroot, a Republican who ran for governor of North Carolina in 2000. In 2006, Smith became the spokesperson for Devout Democrats, an inter-faith, grassroots political action committee designed to convince religious Americans to vote for Democrats. Smith was featured in an ad that ran in newspapers across North Carolina and was featured in an Associated Press article. On October 13, 2008, he endorsed Senator Barack Obama's candidacy for President of the United States.|$|E
5|$|By early April, pro-Heiner ads from Citizens for a Sound Government revived {{charges of}} taking bailouts and tax {{delinquency}} against Bevin and attacked Comer for accepting {{thousands of dollars}} in farm subsidies. Within days, the candidates appeared at a debate where Bevin challenged Heiner to publicly denounce the ads; Heiner responded with a silent smile. Bevin's public challenge to the ad prompted a Lexington television station to pull it after two weeks on the air. Bevin made a $200,000 combined television and radio ad buy to defend himself against the ads and began a telephone survey that touted his conservative credentials while highlighting Heiner's past positions <b>on</b> <b>issues</b> <b>such</b> as gun control before asking how these statements affect the person's view of each candidate. Heiner said the survey was a negative push poll, but Bevin insisted it was a legitimate poll. By the end of April, polls showed that Heiner's lead had evaporated and that the race was essentially a three-way dead heat between him, Bevin, and Comer.|$|E
5|$|During Congressional Reconstruction, U.S. General John Schofield {{administered}} Virginia as Military District One. After 1866, {{according to}} the Radical Reconstruction Acts, a rebelling state which had vacated its delegation in the U.S. Congress was required to incorporate the 14th Amendment into its state constitution before it was allowed to participate again. By the time Schofield called a new state constitutional convention for 1868, three distinct parties had coalesced in Virginia. Radical Republicans, including most ex-slave freedmen, organized to advocate full political and social equality for blacks, but they wanted to exclude ex-Confederates from political participation either in government or at the ballot box. Moderate Unionists including many pre-war Whigs, sought political equality for blacks, but believed that ex-Confederates had {{to be included in}} the political community because of their majority in the white population. Conservatives wanted to ensure white control of the state without Radical influence <b>on</b> <b>issues</b> <b>such</b> as public education.|$|E

5|$|The Football Association Premier League Ltd (FAPL) is {{operated}} as a corporation and {{is owned by}} the 20 member clubs. Each club is a shareholder, with one vote each <b>on</b> <b>issues</b> <b>such</b> as rule changes and contracts. The clubs elect a chairman, chief executive, and board of directors to oversee the daily operations of the league. The current chairman is Sir Dave Richards, who was appointed in April 1999, and the chief executive is Richard Scudamore, appointed in November 1999. The former chairman and chief executive, John Quinton and Peter Leaver, were forced to resign in March 1999 after awarding consultancy contracts to former Sky executives Sam Chisholm and David Chance. The Football Association is not directly involved in the day-to-day operations of the Premier League, but has veto power as a special shareholder during the election of the chairman and chief executive and when new rules are adopted by the league.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} the nomination, Kemp became the ticket's spokesman for minorities and the inner-city. Due to {{agreement on the}} self-help policy that Louis Farrakhan has endorsed in many fora including the Million Man March, Kemp in a sense aligned himself with Farrakhan. However, Farrakhan was perceived as being anti-Semitic, and Kemp was considered an ally of Republican Jews. This issue necessitated some political sidestepping. As the nominee, Kemp at times overshadowed Dole. In fact, more than once, Kemp was described {{as if he was}} the Presidential nominee. In addition to having overshadowed Dole, despite the negative ad campaigns that the ticket used, Kemp was a very positive running mate who relied on a pep rally type of campaign tour full of football-related metaphors and hyperbole. Although some enjoyed Kemp's style, referring to him as the Good Shepherd, his detractors, such as U.S. News & World Report writer Steven V. Roberts, criticized the extensive use of recounting stories of passing balls relative to the use of recounting stories of passing bills. During the campaign, Kemp expressed the opinion that Republican Party leaders did not stand behind the ticket wholeheartedly. Despite Kemp's voice on minority issues, Colin Powell's support and polls that showed about 30% of blacks identified themselves as conservatives <b>on</b> <b>issues</b> <b>such</b> as school prayer, school vouchers and criminal justice, the Republicans were unable to improve upon historical support levels from African-American voters.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{marriage}} to Claude Duchess of Brittany, Francis I of France secured the Union of Brittany and France. On 13 August 1532, the Estates of Brittany confirmed the arrangement by signing the Edict of Union. Upon the death of Francis III, Duke of Brittany in 1536, the Duchy of Brittany passed to Henry II of France. Henry's status as king of France meant that the duchy became merely a French province. Institutions such as the Breton Estates and Parlement of Brittany continued to resist Paris in matters of taxation until their dissolution {{at the end of}} the 18th century. Breton nationalism saw a revival following the 1839 publication of Barzaz Breiz, a collection of traditional Breton folktales, songs and music. Pitre-Chevalier's 1844 Histoire de la Bretagne, followed in the same footsteps by highlighting a number of historical events as manifestations of Breton nationalism and aspirations of independence. Chevalier did not hesitate to distort the causes of revolts such as the Revolt of the papier timbré, in order to promote his agenda. The end of the 19th century was marked by the disintegration of archaic Breton social and economic structures with a parallel drive for compulsory primary education. During the course of the latter, primary teachers were specifically instructed with phasing out minority languages. Early Breton nationalist organizations such as Association Brettone (founded in 1829) focused <b>on</b> <b>issues</b> <b>such</b> as the preservation of the Breton language and administrative autonomy. By 1914, the Breton language had embraced by the region's intellectuals through a literary revival failing however to reach the masses.|$|E
