The pair notice a red comet in the sky; Bran remarks that the men claim it is an omen of victory for one side <b>or</b> <b>another</b> <b>in</b> the war, but Osha insists it means one thing: dragons have returned.|$|E

25|$|Evansville's {{original}} downtown plat {{was made}} on about 200 acres, with streets running parallel to the river from northwest to southeast.

Thus, anyone entering or leaving downtown finds the street makes a confusing oblique-angle turn in one direction <b>or</b> <b>another.</b> <b>In</b> the 1970s, the city suffered from problems such as decreased economic activity and suburban flight, but city-sponsored revitalization has improved downtown conditions.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, marine {{forensic}} investigators {{considered that}} {{an explosion in}} the ship's steam-generating plant could be a plausible explanation for the second explosion. However, accounts from the few survivors who managed to escape the forward two boiler rooms reported that the ship's boilers did not explode. Leading Fireman Albert Martin later testified he thought the torpedo actually entered the boiler room and exploded between a group of boilers, which was a physical impossibility. It is also known the forward boiler room filled with steam, and steam pressure feeding the turbines dropped dramatically following the second explosion. These point toward a failure, of one sort <b>or</b> <b>another,</b> <b>in</b> the ship's steam-generating plant. It is possible the failure came, not directly from one of the boilers in boiler room no. 1, but rather in the high-pressure steam lines to the turbines.|$|E

500|$|The {{breeding}} season varies markedly across the brown honeyeater’s range, with breeding recorded in one location <b>or</b> <b>another</b> <b>in</b> every {{month of the}} year. Breeding can occur two or more times a year if conditions are favourable. The nest is built {{in a variety of}} vegetation types, usually in dense foliage in the fork of a horizontal branch, often near water, and rarely more than [...] above ground. The nest is a small, deep, round cup, woven from small pieces of grass and soft bark, especially Melaleuca bark, bound with spider web and lined with plant down, such as from Banksias, or cow hair or wool. Both sexes contribute to the nest building, though the male also stands guard while the female is building the nest.|$|E

500|$|Significant {{controversy}} surrounds female {{genital mutilation}} (FGM), with the World Health Organization (WHO) {{being one of}} many health organizations that have campaigned against the procedures on behalf of human rights, stating that [...] "FGM has no health benefits" [...] {{and that it is}} [...] "a violation of the human rights of girls and women" [...] and [...] "reflects deep-rooted inequality between the sexes". The practice has existed at one point <b>or</b> <b>another</b> <b>in</b> almost all human civilizations, most commonly to exert control over the sexual behavior, including masturbation, of girls and women, but also to change the clitoris's appearance. Custom and tradition are the most frequently cited reasons for FGM, with some cultures believing that not performing it has the possibility of disrupting the cohesiveness of their social and political systems, such as FGM also being a part of a girl's initiation into adulthood. Often, a girl is not considered an adult in a FGM-practicing society unless she has undergone FGM, and the [...] "removal of the clitoris and labia– viewed by some as the male parts of a woman's body– is thought to enhance the girl's femininity, often synonymous with docility and obedience".|$|E

Reader wrote that [...] "t is not at all uncommon to find T206 examples that have been altered at some point during their near-century of existence." [...] These discrepancies were taken advantage of by [...] "card doctors" [...] who trimmed corners and dirty edges to improve the appearance of the card. The front of all T206 series cards, including the Wagner card, displayed a lithograph of the player created by a multi-stage printing process in which a number of colors were printed {{on top of each other}} to create a lithograph with the appropriate design. The backs of the cards featured the monochromatic colors of the 16 tobacco brands for which the cards were printed. The Wagner cards in particular advertised the Piedmont and Sweet Caporal brands of cigarettes and were produced at Factory 25 in Virginia, as indicated by the factory stamp imprinted on the back of the cards.|$|E

[...] Other composers such as Béla Bartók, Luciano Berio, Benjamin Britten, John Cage, Aaron Copland, Olivier Messiaen, Arvo Pärt, Walter Piston, Ned Rorem, Alfred Schnittke, Dmitri Shostakovich, and Igor Stravinsky used serialism only for some of their compositions or only for some sections of pieces, as did some jazz composers such as Yusef Lateef and Bill Evans.|$|E
