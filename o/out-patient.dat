40|$|The present paper {{reports the}} {{isolation}} and characterization of drug resistant E. coli from the urine {{from the hospital}} <b>out-patients</b> and in-patients from 1976 to 1978 December. E. coli strains isolated from urine speciemens during the above period were examinated for sensitivity against 12 drugs such as aminobenzilpenicillin, carbenicillin, minocycline, colistin, nalidixic acid, cephalothin, cephazolin, kanamycin, gentamicin, dibekacin, tobramycin and polymixin. From the urine of <b>out-patients</b> women with acute cystitis, 515 strains of pathogens were isolated during that period, and 388 strains (75. 3 %) of them were E. coli. From the urine of in-patients, 193 (8. 9 %) out of 2714 strains isolated from the urine were E. coli. The sensitivity pattern of the above drugs against E. coli from the urine of <b>out-patients</b> showed better sensitivity than that from in-patients. The difference of sensitivity for each drug was smaller in <b>out-patients</b> (from CB-PC 68. 8 to GM 100 %) than in in-patients (from AB-PC 21. 1 to GM 98. 4 %). Among double drug resistance in <b>out-patients</b> and in-patients, the most frequent combination was AB-PC and CB-PC. In <b>out-patients</b> the multiple drug resistance was within a combination of four drugs, while for in-patients it extended until resistance against all drugs...|$|R

40|$|Background: Reproductive tract {{infections are}} public health {{problems}} in women of reproductive age and {{can result in}} serious consequences if not treated. Aims: To determine the prevalence and causes of reproductive tract infections among in-patients and <b>out-patients</b> attending a tertiary health institution in Benin City. The antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of bacterial agents will also be determined. Patients and Methods: High vaginal swabs or endocervical swabs and blood were collected from 957 patients consisting of 755 <b>out-patients</b> and 202 in-patients. The swabs were processed and microbial isolates identified using standard technique. Disc susceptibility tests were also performed on microbial isolates. The blood samples were used for serological diagnosis of syphilis. Results: There {{was no significant difference}} in the prevalence of female reproductive tract infections between in-patients (52. 48 %) and <b>out-patients</b> (47. 02 %), although in-patients showed a significantly higher risk of developing mixed infections (in-patients vs. out-patients; 34. 91 % vs. 22. 25 %, OR = 1. 873 95 % CI = 1. 169, 3. 001; P = 0. 01). Candida albicans was the most prevalent etiologic agent among <b>out-patients</b> studied while Staphylococcus aureus was the most prevalent etiologic agent among in-patients. Trichomonas vaginalis was observed only among <b>out-patients.</b> Ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were the most active antibacterial agents. Syphilis was not detected in any patient. Conclusion: An overall prevalence of 48. 17 % of female reproductive tract infection was observed among the study population. Although there was no significant difference between in-patients and <b>out-patients,</b> in-patients appeared to have 1 - 3 -fold increase risk of developing mixed infections. The most prevalent etiologic agent differs between in-patients and <b>out-patients.</b> Despite the high activity of ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against bacterial isolates from both in-patients and <b>out-patients,</b> prudent use of antibacterial agents is advocated...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} about 35 years since the {{neuropsychiatry}} clinic was opened in Yamaguchi University Hospital. It {{is well known that}} the content of medical care in psychiatry is changing because of many factors such as the development of psychotropic drugs. In the present study, the medical charts of <b>out-patients</b> in our department in 1962, 1972 and 1982 were surveyed for each year, respectively, in order to clarify the number of all <b>out-patients</b> and of new <b>out-patients,</b> their diagnosis, their age, their address {{and whether or not they}} required admission. Similarly, the population of Ube City every 10 years in 1960, 1970 and 1980 was studied. The number of all <b>out-patients</b> was unchanged, however, the number of new <b>out-patients</b> decreased markedly step by step. Among them, a decrease of younger patients and an increase of older patients were observed. The number of patients with manic-depressive illness and neurosis was unchanged, however, that with schizophrenia decreased significantly. Moreover, the admission rate of the patients with manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia also decreased. The greater part of the patient's address distributed in or near Ube City. The population of Ube City was unchanged, however, a marked decreased of younger persons and an increase of older persons was shown. These results suggest that our department occupied an important position as a civil hospital in psychiatry and has a significant role in regional psychiatric medicine...|$|R

This was a controversial approach that attracted both international interest and local criticism from some colleagues. Another innovation was to establish formal links with the burgeoning Art Therapy movement.
