5000|$|For example, {{the ability}} of capnophiles to {{tolerate}} (or utilize) the amount of oxygen that is also in their environment may vary widely and may be far more critical to their survival. Species of Campylobacter are bacterial capnophiles that are more easily identified because they are also microaerophiles, organisms that can grow in high carbon dioxide {{as long as a}} small amount of free oxygen is present, but at a dramatically reduced concentration. (In the earth's atmosphere carbon dioxide levels are approximately five hundred times lower than that of oxygen, 0.04% and 21% of the total, respectively.) Obligate anaerobes are microbes that will die in the presence of oxygen without respect to the concentration of carbon dioxide in their environment, and typically acquire energy through anaerobic respiration, or fermentation (biochemistry). [...] In 2004, a capnophilic bacterium was characterized that appears to require carbon dioxide. This organism, Mannheimia succiniciproducens, has a unique metabolism involving carbon fixation. While carbon fixation is common to most plant life on earth since it is the key initial step in the biosynthesis of complex carbon compounds during photosynthesis (the Calvin cycle), it is found in relatively few microorganisms and not found in animals. Mannheimia succiniciproducens can attach carbon dioxide to the three-carbon backbone of phosphoenolpyruvate, an endproduct in glycolysis, to generate the four-carbon compound, <b>oxaloacetic</b> <b>acid,</b> an intermediate in the Krebs cycle. Although Mannheimia succiniciproducens has most of the intermediates in the Krebs cycle, it is not capable of oxidative phosphorylation, the final step in the electron transport chain that would allow it to carry out the highly efficient process of harvesting energy by aerobic respiration.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: Certain {{bacteria}} of {{the genus}} Pseudomonas attack the tartaric acids by means of inducible stereospecific dehydrases. Each dehydrase converts its specific isomeric substrate to oxaloacetic acid; in crude cell-free extracts the <b>oxaloacetic</b> <b>acid</b> is in turn converted to pyruvic acid, which accumulates. By treatment of the crude extracts with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), substantial accumulations of <b>oxaloacetic</b> <b>acid</b> {{can be obtained from}} the meso- and d-tartaric acids, and assays for these two dehydrases, based on the accumulation of <b>oxaloacetic</b> <b>acid</b> in the presence of EDTA, have been developed. This procedure cannot be used to assay the Z-tartaric acid dehydrase, which is itself very sensitive to EDTA.

40|$|Carbonaceous meteorites {{deliver a}} variety of organic {{compounds}} to Earth that {{may have played a}} role in the origin and/or evolution of biochemical pathways. Some apparently ancient and critical metabolic processes require several compounds, some of which are relatively labile such as keto acids.

To date, compounds such as pyruvic acid, <b>oxaloacetic</b> <b>acid,</b> citric acid, isocitric acid, and α-ketoglutaric acid (all members of the citric acid cycle) have not been identified in extraterrestrial sources or, as a group, as part of a “one pot” suite of compounds synthesized under plausibly prebiotic conditions.
