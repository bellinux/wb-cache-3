40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{three main}} phenomena in the morpho-syntax and morpho-phonology of Bantu languages {{in which the}} 1 SG object prefix (OP) and/or the reflexive, display anoma-lous properties compared to <b>other</b> <b>OPs.</b> (i) The 1 SG OP and the reflexive commonly have unique combinatorial properties with additional OPs.

(iii) The 1 SG OP (but usually not the reflexive) participate differently in reduplication. Each of these phenomena {{is the subject of}} a micro-typological survey within Bantu, the results of which support the conclusion that morpho-syntactic and morpho-phonological factors are responsi-ble for the full range of anomalous patterns of the 1 SG OP and reflexive across Bantu. The exceptional abilities of the 1 SG OP and reflexive OP to combine with an extra OP and to trigger a different pattern of FV allomorphy in the imperative are the result of a distinct, lower structural position of the 1 SG and reflexive prefixes compared to <b>other</b> <b>OPs,</b> but the overcopying of the 1 SG OP in reduplication has a phonological basis...|$|R

This sort of structure is common among the sonate da chiesa composed by Corelli, however this one is the one on which future composers based their symphonies and concerti. This structure may not be Corelli's own, however he, along with Antonio Vivaldi, certainly helped bring it into orchestral music.|$|E

40|$|A {{novel and}} highly {{sensitive}} sensing {{strategy for the}} detection of organophosphorus compounds (OPs) based on the catalytic reaction of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and acetylcholine (ATCh) during the modulated synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) has been developed. The enzymatic hydrolysis of ATCh by AChE yields thiocholine (TCh), which induces the aggregation of AgNPs during synthesis, and the absorption peak at 382 nm corresponding to AgNPs decreases. The enzymatic reaction can be regulated by OPs, which can covalently bind to the active site of AChE and decrease the TCh formation, thereby decreasing the aggregation and significantly enhancing the absorption peak at 382 nm. The proposed system achieved good linearity and limits of detection of 0. 078 nM and 2. 402 nM for trichlorfon and malathion, respectively, by UV-visible spectroscopy. Further, the sensitivity of the proposed system was demonstrated through the determination of OPs in different spiked real samples.

40|$|Our {{research}} {{was focused on}} a preliminary comparison of three cleanup procedures for the determination of 26 organophosphorus (OP) pesticide residues in cereal matrixes. The aim {{of the study was}} to reduce the analytical problems associated with the presence of high-molecular-weight compounds in these matrixes in order to improve the efficiency of the chromatographic separation. The method was based on the extraction of OP pesticides from the samples with the use of petroleum ether, acetone, and dichloromethane, and on three different cleanup procedures, followed by GC identification. The first procedure was carried out with a multicartridge system; the second procedure consisted of a low-temperature lipid precipitation; for the third procedure, acid and neutral alumina were used for cleanup of the extract. The use of deactivated acidic alumina as the adsorbent medium and the use of n-hexane-dichloromethane-ethyl acetate (6 + 3 + 1, v/v/v) as the eluting system were preferred. After purification, the residue was injected into a gas chromatograph for separation followed by nitrogen-phosphorus detection; the identities of the OP pesticides in positive samples were confirmed by GC/MS.

40|$|Organophosphorus (OP) {{insecticides}} {{and chemical}} warfare agents act primarily by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase. There are many secondary targets for OP toxicants as observed for example {{with the major}} insecticide chlorpyrifos and its bioactivated metabolite chlorpyrifos oxon (CPO). Therefore, it was surprising that the predominant mouse brain protein labeled in vitro by [3 H-ethyl]CPO (1 nM) (designated CPO-binding protein or CPO-BP) {{is not one of}} these known OP toxicant targets. CPO-BP is a 50 -kDa membrane-bound serine hydrolase measured by derivatization with [3 H]CPO and SDS/PAGE or filtration binding assay. It appears to undergo rapid diethylphosphorylation by [3 H]CPO followed by either dephosphorylation and reactivation or aging on loss of an ethyl group. CPO and several <b>other</b> <b>OP</b> toxicants potently inhibit CPO-BP in vivo (i. p., 2 h) (50 % inhibition at 2 - 25 mg/kg) and in vitro (50 % inhibition at 8 - 68 nM). Using three chemical labeling reagents, i. e., [3 H]CPO and the activity-based proteomic probes fluorophosphonate-biotin and fluorophosphonate-rhodamine, mouse brain CPO-BP is identified as serine hydrolase KIAA 1363 of unknown function. Brains from KIAA 1363 -/- mice show greatly reduced levels of CPO labeling and hydrolytic metabolism compared to brains from wild-type mice.

40|$|Chlorpyrifos {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{pesticides}} used for agriculture crop protection, and widespread contamination is a potential concern. However, chlorpyrifos is hydrolyzed almost 1, 000 -fold slower than the preferred substrate, paraoxon, by organophosphorus hydrolase (OPH), an enzyme that can degrade a broad range of organophosphate pesticides. We have recently demonstrated that directed evolution can be used to generate OPH variants with up to 25 -fold improvement in hydrolysis of methyl parathion. The obvious question and challenge are whether similar success could be achieved with this poorly hydrolyzed substrate, chlorpyr-ifos. For this study, five improved variants were selected from two rounds of directed evolution based on the formation of clear haloes on Luria-Bertani plates overlaid with chlorpyrifos. One variant, B 3561, exhibited a 725 -fold increase in the kcat/Km value for chlorpyrifos hydrolysis as well as enhanced hydrolysis rates for several <b>other</b> <b>OP</b> compounds tested.

In this paper the results are analyzed. One can reproduce lepton and gauge boson masses exactly by taking into account Coulomb self energy associated with the interior of 3 -surface and a small mixing of boundary topologies of charged leptons. Hadronic mass formula in- volves boundary contributions of quarks calculated previously plus interior term consisting isospin-isopin, color magnetic spin-spin and color Coulombic terms. One must take also into account mixing of boundary topologies, the mixing for primary condensate levels (quark spends part of time at lower condensate level) and mixing of I= 0,J= 0 mesons. Topological mixing implies the nontriviality of CKM matrix. An open question is how uniquely rationality require- ment fixes CKM matrix.

We performed a cross-sectional study of associations between dialkylphosphate metabolites of organophosphates and semen quality among pesticide applicators in Majes (Arequipa), Peru. Methods Thirty-one men exposed to organophosphate (OP) pesticides and 31 non-exposed were recruited (age, 20 – 60 years). In exposed subjects, semen and {{a blood sample}} were obtained {{one day after the}} last pesticide application. Subjects were grouped according to levels of OP metabolites in urine. Semen samples were analyzed for sperm concentration, percentage of sperm motility, percentage of normal morphology, semen leucocytes and concentrations of fructose and zinc. Exposure to OP was assessed by measuring six urinary OP metabolites (dimethyl and diethyl phosphates and thiophosphates) by gas chromatography using a single flame photometric detector. Results Diethyldithiophosphate (p = 0. 04) and diethylthiophosphate (p = 0. 02) better reflected occupational pesticide exposure than <b>other</b> <b>OP</b> metabolites. Semen analysis revealed a significant reduction of semen volume and an increase in semen pH in men with OP metabolites.

30|$|The {{current study}} {{depicted}} {{the low level}} of acetylcholinesterase in malathion-treated group. These results are similar to the previous researchers who stated that pseudocholinesterase and acetylcholinesterase activity have been inhibited by the organophosphorus pesticides in the body tissues (John et al. 2001; Kalender et al. 2006; Rubin et al. 2002). These changes depend on concentration and intensify with longer exposure. The effects of malathion and <b>other</b> <b>OPs</b> may be at least partially because of they are able to cross the blood–testis barrier and enhance oxidative stress and peroxidation of lipids causing damage to the testes (Uzunhisarcikli et al. 2007). Malathion does not directly inhibit action of the acetylcholinesterase before it is biotransformed. The toxicity to mammals of organophosphorus pesticides as malathion depends on mixed function oxidase (MFO) induced activation to its analogous oxygen correspondent, which directly inhibit acetylcholinesterase (Pope 1999). Therefore, biological effects of malathion can be due to electrophilic attack on the cells with concomitant production of reactive oxygen species (Johnson et al. 2000). Therefore, the harmful effects of malathion on reproductive system of male mice may be due to its electrophilic attack on their cells.|$|R
