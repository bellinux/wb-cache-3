40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the electrochemiluminecence (ECL) of luminophores generated by cathodic pulse polarization of oxide film-coated electrodes in aqueous medium, and the chemiluminecence (CL) of luminophores {{induced by the}} dissolution of oxide film-covered aluminum or magnesium in appropriate aqueous medium. Their extremely sensitive ECL and CL signals allow these luminophores {{to be used as}} labels in bioaffinity assays, such as immunoassays and DNA probe assays in place of radioactive and enzymatic labels. In this work, the weight is on the exploration of usable electrochemiluminescent labels and electrochemiluminescence in general. Three types of <b>luminophores</b> were studied: <b>organic</b> <b>luminophores,</b> transition metal chelates, and lanthanide chelates. The ECL mechanisms of the luminophores were of interest. In principle, the tunnel emission of hot electrons into the aqueous electrolyte, which successively generate hydrated electrons, is the common initial step for ECL of all the studied luminophores. All of the present label molecules (except luminol) seem most efficiently to be excited by a route in which the label is first one-electron oxidized (or reduced) and the resulting radical is immediately reduced (or oxidized) by the primary or secondary radicals of the system. The ECL systems are characterized by the coreactant involved, the thickness of oxide film, and pH of the buffer solution. The hot electron-induced ECL excitation method provides a basis for time-resolved measurements. Thus, novel immunoassays and DNA-probe assays can be developed in which a combination of time-resolution and wavelength discrimination is applied in the simultaneous detection of several different labels. Some applications of immunoassays based on Tb(III) chelate labels and hot electron-excited ECL at insulating film-coated electrodes were demonstrated. The assays were reasonably sensitive and it was shown {{that it is possible to}} develop both non-competitive and competitive immunoassays based on the detection of hot electron-induced ECL of labels. ECL of <b>organic</b> <b>luminophores</b> and metal chelates with different characteristic emission properties can be induced by hot electron excitation method in aqueous medium. Present studies widen the choices for electrochemiluminescent and chemiluminescent labels in immunoassays. reviewe...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} the mixed annihilation electrogenerated chemiluminescence of tris(2, 2 ′-bipyridine) ruthenium(ii) with various cyclometalated iridium(iii) chelates. Compared to mixed ECL systems comprising <b>organic</b> <b>luminophores,</b> {{the absence of}} T-route pathways enables effective predictions of the observed ECL based on simple estimations of the exergonicity of the reactions leading to excited state production. Moreover, the multiple, closely spaced reductions and oxidations of the metal chelates provide the ability to finely tune the energetics and therefore the observed emission colour. Distinct emissions from multiple luminophores in the same solution are observed in numerous systems. The relative intensity of these emissions and the overall emission colour are dependent on the particular oxidized and reduced species selected by the applied electrochemical potentials. Finally, these studies offer insights into the importance of electronic factors in {{the question of whether}} the reduced or oxidized partner becomes excited in annihilation ECL.

40|$|Flat dendrimers, {{consisting}} of a hexavalent aromatic core and rigid ethynyl units locked in place by ether connections were developed based upon the divergent synthetic method. Alternating functional groups were adopted on each site of the hexa-substituted benzene, {{in order to avoid}} undesired cyclization pathways. The flat structures of conjugated dendrimers would allow investigation on the discotic liquid crystal properties. In addition, these ethylnyl dendrimers are expected to show directed energy and electron transfer with a highly conjugated system, and thus are effective in the preparation of photoreactive materials such as electronic sensors or light harvesting materials. Conjugated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, {{consisting of}} naphthalene, anthracene, pyrene, and phenanthrene groups connected via 1, 3, 5 -triethynylbenzene cores, were synthesized. These molecules exhibited luminescence properties and the π-complexation with a mercury trifunctional lewis acid are expected to enhance the phosphorescence {{in the presence of the}} heavy metal due to the spin-orbit coupling. Besides, owing to the presence of heavy metal atom in the Au (I) complexes linked by s-bonded triethynyltriphenylene luminophore, the phosphorescence occurs from a metal-centered emission. The conjugated <b>organic</b> <b>luminophores</b> have been developed to produce excellent quantum efficiencies, brightness, and long lifetimes...|$|R
30|$|The {{research}} {{was carried out}} to determine the possibility to use luminescent nanosized systems for registration of changes {{that take place in}} packaged food products during storage. We studied the influence of substances that emerge in food products as a result of spoilage processes (lactic and acetic acids, alcohols, amines) on luminescence of nanosized zinc oxide (ZnO) and <b>organic</b> <b>luminophores.</b> We created nanophotonic compositions and researched their properties in order to use them for the manufacture of printed novel packaging. Nanophotonic systems as printed elements are promising to ensure the functionality of novel packaging—active and intelligent (smart) packaging, which inform on the status of a packaged food product by changing the properties of an external or internal printed elements or sensors (optical, mechanical, electronic, or other properties). These changes are to be registered visually or instrumentally, by internal of external devices (sensors), in the latter case enabling combination with ICT, as the response of packaging can be transformed into electrical signals and processed and analyzed or passed into computer systems for processing. Therefore, creating nanophotonic compositions and future simulation and study of the characteristics of printing techniques of producing printed elements and functional surfaces, including multilayer, containing these system is an actual task. It will enable cost- and energy-efficient creation of active and intelligent packaging merged with ICT, whose mechanism of action is based on photonic phenomena observed in nanoscale components.|$|R

40|$|Background. 1, 3, 5 -triaryl- 2 -pyrazolines are <b>organic</b> <b>luminophores</b> with arylic {{radicals}} {{that show}} a wide biological activity {{and are used}} as liquid scintillators and electro-optic materials. Experimental. Eleven 2 -pyrazolines were synthesized from phenylhidrazine and chalcones of the 8 -hydroxyquinoline series: 3 -(8 -hydroxyquinolin- 5 -yl) - 1 -(3 -R) -phenylprop- 2 -enone and 1 -(8 -hydroxyquinolin- 5 -yl) - 3 [...] (3 -R) -phenylprop- 2 -enone, where R = H, CH 3, OCH 3, N(CH 3) 2, Cl, r, and NO 2. The structures were confirmed by elemental analysis, IR, 1 H-NMR, and electronic spectroscopy. Results and discussion. The 1 - and 3 - aryl substituents of the pyrazoline ring produced shifts to shorter or longer wavelengths, in absorbance and fluorescence. The electron acceptor hydroxyquinolinic fragment influenced the absorption and luminescence spectra; the possible cause of low quantum yields in pyrazolines 4 а-g (1 -phenyl- 3 -(4 -R phenyl) - 5 -(8 -hydroxyquinolinil- 5) - 2 -pyrazoline) may be the specific intramolecular fluorescence quenching in bicromophores, characteristic of 5 -acceptor substituted pyrazolines, and, in series 5 а-g (1 -phenyl- 5 -(4 -R phenyl) - 3 -(8 -hydroxyquinolinil- 5) - 2 -pyrazoline) of excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) reactions, and the increasing donor-acceptor intramolecular interaction of their excited molecules; Density functional calculations (method PM 6) were used to probe the electronic structure and energy ordering of the emissive and the electron-transfer states; PM 6 results agreed with the experimental data. 1 -phenyl- 3 -(4 -R phenyl) - 5 -(8 -hydroxyquinolinil- 5) - 2 -pyrazoline showed fungistatic and fungicide activities.

40|$|Subtle {{changes in}} {{molecular}} structure {{have been used}} to alter the molecular packing and optical properties of <b>organic</b> <b>luminophores.</b> Thus it is important to study simple and advantageous structural modification to overcome limitations of aggregation quenching of fluorescence. Planar conjugated organic compounds are unlikely to be used in OLED devices as they suffer with luminescence weakening due to pi-pi cofacial stacking and excimer formation in the solid state. To avoid such critical issues, doped device architecture for OLED devices has widely been adopted which actually complicates the device fabrication process. Thus an approach for delimiting these drawbacks using simple methodologies is highly desirable for cost effective OLED device fabrication. In this context, two 3 -dimensional rigid arms have been introduced into a planar benzo[h]chromen- 2 -one core, which suffers from aggregation caused quenching, as peripheral substituents to tune the molecular packing and subsequently their optical properties. The resultant compounds 1 and 2 have been tested for non-doped and doped OLED device application. Compound 1 was found to be highly thermally stable with a decomposition temperature of 344 degrees C. Single crystal XRD studies helped to elucidate that voluminous ring substituents are capable of eradicating co-facial pi-pi stacking by increasing the intermolecular distance and hence the luminescence in the solid state could be regenerated. This tuning of intermolecular distance between molecules helped to mitigate the close packed arrangement at a molecular level and also provided the bulk with the enhanced emission property. Electroluminescence from a pristine layer of compound 1 was possible. Thus an approach enabling planar luminophores to be used in OLED applications utilizing thin films of structurally engineered luminophores has been presented. ...|$|R
40|$|N,N′-Chelating ligands {{based on}} the 2 -(2 -pyridyl) {{benzimidazole}} (PB) core have been prepared {{with a range of}} substituents (phenyl, pentafluorophenyl, naphthyl, anthracenyl, pyrenyl) connected to the periphery via alkylation of the benzimidazolyl unit at one of the N atoms. These PB ligands have been used to prepare a series of complexes of the type [Re(PB) (CO) 3 Cl], [Pt(PB) (CCR) 2] (where –CCR is an acetylide ligand) and [Ru(bpy) 2 (PB) ][PF 6] 2 (bpy = 2, 2 ′-bipyridine). Six of the complexes have been structurally characterised. Electrochemical and luminescence studies show that all three series of complexes behave in a similar manner to the analogous complexes with 2, 2 ′-bipyridine in place of PB. In particular, all three series of complexes show luminescence in the range 553 – 605 nm (Pt series), 620 – 640 nm (Re series) and 626 – 645 nm (Ru series) arising from the 3 MLCT state, with members of the Pt(II) series being the most strongly emissive with lifetimes of up to 500 ns and quantum yields of up to 6 % in air-saturated CH 2 Cl 2 at room temperature. In the Re and Ru series there was clear evidence for inter-component energy-transfer processes in both directions between the 3 MLCT state of the metal centre and the singlet and triplet states of the pendant <b>organic</b> <b>luminophores</b> (naphthalene, pyrene, anthracene). For example the pyrene singlet is almost completely quenched by energy transfer to a Re-based MLCT excited state, which in turn is completely quenched by energy transfer to the lower-lying pyrene triplet state. For the analogous Ru(II) complexes the inter-component energy transfer is less effective, with 1 anthracene → Ru(3 MLCT) energy transfer being absent, and Ru(3 MLCT) → 3 anthracene energy transfer being incomplete. This is rationalised {{on the basis of a}} greater effective distance for energy transfer in the Ru(II) series, because the MLCT excited states are localised on the bpy ligands which are remote from the pendant aromatic group; in the Re series in contrast, the MLCT excited states involve the PB ligand to which the pendant aromatic group is directly attached, giving more efficient energy transfer...|$|R
40|$|This {{work has}} {{involved}} {{designing and synthesizing}} conjugated molecular and polymeric materials which are highly functionalized through structural modifications {{in order to enhance}} their electronic, photonic and morphological properties. The main objective is to synthesize novel <b>organic</b> <b>luminophores</b> which have efficient photoluminescence, as well as to optimize electroluminescence properties for organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). ^ A series of well-defined 2, 7 -bis(phenylethenyl) fluorenes/fluorenones (OFPVs/OFOPV) and 2, 7 -bis(phenyl) fluorenes/fluorenones (OFPhs) have been synthesized. The main synthetic methodologies used are palladium-catalyzed Heck coupling, Suzuki coupling and Knoevenagel condensation. The structure-property relationships [...] -especially the effect of the fluorenone moiety on the photophysical and electroluminescent properties of these OFPVs, OFPhs and OFOPVs [...] -were systematically investigated. The origin of an unwanted low-energy emission (g-band) in fluorene derivatives was evaluated by single-molecule and controlled luminophore/impurity blending photoluminescence studies (SMPL). ^ OFPV and its segmented copolymer, poly-FPV (1 - 2) exhibit highly blue fluorescence in chloroform solution with quantum efficiencies of 0. 93 and 0. 68 respectively. Electroluminescence characteristics in an LED configuration ITO/PEDOT-PSS/(1 or 2) /Ca-Al of both were evaluated and OFPV gave much better EL performances with compared to its analogous segmented copolymer. The luminance efficiency of LEDs with OFPV was over 10 -fold higher than those with copolymer 2, 0. 515 versus 0. 040 cd/A, with turn-on voltages of 3 and 5 V, respectively. Blends of 1 with PMMA gave stronger luminance than neat 1, with only a modest increase in turn-on voltage. A 10 %(w/w) 1 :PMMA based LED showed a maximum luminance of 450 cd/m 2 at 7 V, with a luminance efficiency of 4. 5 cd/A and a turn on voltage of 4. 5 V. ^ Among the structurally functionalized OFPVs, terminal heptyloxy substitution to make OFPV (8) gave the best electroluminescence performance as a blue emitter. It shows maximum luminance efficiency of 1. 02 cd/A with maximum brightness of 1500 cd/m 2 at 12 V. Unlike the OFPVs, shorter conjugation length OFPhs gave poor LED performance with an undesired longer wavelength green component at 500 - 550 nm in EL spectra. Blending the OFPhs with PMMA eliminated this long wavelength component and gave better color purity blue LED emission up to 25 %(w/w) blends, even though these still gave poor overall LED emission efficiencies compare to the OFPVs. ...|$|R
40|$|Two major {{topics that}} involve {{synthetic}} strategies {{to enhance the}} phosphorescence of <b>organic</b> and inorganic <b>luminophores</b> have been investigated. The first topic involves, the photophysical and photochemical properties of the gold (I) complexes LAuIX (L = CO, RNC where R = alkyl or aryl group; X = halide or pseudohalide), which have been investigated and found to exhibit Au-centered phosphorescence and tunable photochemical reactivity. The investigations have shown a clear relationship between the luminescence energies and association modes. We have also demonstrated {{for the first time}} that aurophilic bonding and the ligand p-acceptance can sensitize the photoreactivity of Au(I) complexes. The second topic involves conventional organic fluorophores (arenes), which are made to exhibit room-temperature phosphorescence that originates from spin-orbit coupling owing to either an external or internal heavy atom effect in systematically designed systems that contain d 10 metals. Facial complexation of polycyclic arenes to tris[{m-(3, 4, 5, 6 -tetrafluorophenylene) }mercury(II) ], C 18 F 12 Hg 3 (1) results in crystalline adducts that exhibit bright RGB (red-green-blue) phosphorescence bands at room temperature. This arene-centered phosphorescence is always accompanied by a reduction of the triplet excited state lifetime due to its sensitization by accelerating the radiative instead of the non-radiative decay. The results of both topics are significant for rational design of efficient metal and arene-centered phosphors for molecular light emitting diodes in addition to the fundamental novelties in inorganic chemistry and molecular spectroscopy...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a {{study of}} two major topics that involve synthetic strategies for new classes of phosphorescent gold(I) -based metallodendrimers. The phosphorescence of <b>organic</b> and inorganic <b>luminophores</b> originates from spin-orbit coupling owing to internal or external heavy atom effects as well as metal-centered emissions. Previous work in the Omary group entailed systematically designed small molecules, metallopolymers, and unconjugated metallodendrimers that contain d 10 and d 8 metals, whereas this dissertation aims in part to expand such strategies to the conjugated metallodendrimer regime. In one approach novel synthetic strategies were used to make first-generation phenyl acetylene dendrimers and phosphine derivatives thereof. The phosphine dendrimers are made by tethering one of the phosphines to an unsaturated dendrimer, as such phosphine dendrimers are better chromophores and luminophores due to their structural rigidity and extended conjugation. In another approach, 2 - and 3 -coordinate Au(I) dendritic complexes are synthesized from these phosphine dendrimers. This study is further extended to study metallodendritic complexes with different cores, for example triphenylene-based metallodendritic complexes with six acetylene branches. The physical properties of the metallodendrimers can be modulated upon proceeding to further dendrimer generations or by using solubilizing groups on the peripheral phosphines, thus allowing better processability for thin-film fabrication as required for molecular electronic devices and higher chance for crystal growth toward accurate structural characterization. Other data produced in this project suggested that some structural alterations led to porous solids that render them suitable for realized and potential applications in energy storage and carbon capture. The interesting luminescence properties of the metallodendrimers and porous extended solids produced in this dissertation are significant toward utilizing such materials for optoelectronic applications such as energy-saving organic light-emitting diodes and optical sensors for environmental pollutants...|$|R
