500|$|In {{the midst}} of our short {{conversation}} of yesterday, & still more pleasant than short, you expressed a wish to receive a sketch in prose of the thing we desired. I am sure your kindness renders it a duty incumbent <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> return, to afford you every facility in my power. I therefore inclose two scribbles with which I would not otherwise have troubled you. That in small writing is the production of my daughter in her eleventh year, & is strictly modelled, as ar as [...] her infant talents would allow, on Dibdin's song. This may answer {{the purpose of a}} prose sketch. The other is written by a young man of twenty. It is rather unintelligible: but the two first two stanzas may afford you a hint respecting the first two designs.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Vibe on July 7, 2010, Knowles said she suffered [...] "a {{little bit of a}} breakdown" [...] while recording her new album: [...] "I literally gave up my sanity for a while to do this record. [...] We literally were waking {{up in the morning and}} just making music all day and all night. [...] It just started to wear <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> so many different ways. I started having these crazy panic attacks." [...] Knowles explained how she made sacrifices [...] "mentally, emotionally and financially", and continued, [...] "It's more than an album to me. It's a transitional time in my life." [...] Regarding the musical direction of the album, she said the inspiration came from new wave and stated, [...] "This is a dance record, but the lyrics can get pretty dark at times." ...|$|E
500|$|Circus {{opens with}} its lead single [...] "Womanizer". It {{features}} synth sirens with a repetitive chorus, and lyrically discusses a cheating man; it {{was described by}} Spears as a girl anthem. [...] "Circus" [...] addresses her feelings as an entertainer and performing, highlighted in the lines [...] "All eyes <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> {{the centre of the}} ring just like a circus / When I crack that whip everybody gonna trip just like a circus". Its electronic dance elements were compared to those of Spears's earlier single [...] "Break the Ice". The ballad [...] "Out from Under" [...] incorporates acoustic guitar backings, and has gathered comparisons to her track [...] "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman". [...] "Kill the Lights" [...] is a dance-pop song that talks about Spears's conflict with paparazzi. Critics noted similarities to the works of Madonna as well as Spears's own [...] "Piece of Me". [...] "Shattered Glass" [...] utilizes dark electronic beats and details a non-repairable relationship.|$|E

500|$|In a 2012 interview, Glenn {{said that}} the purpose of his flight was [...] "to make {{measurements}} and do research on me at the age of 77... comparing the results <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> space with the younger [...] and maybe get [...] on the immune system or protein turnover or vestibular functions and other things—heart changes". Glenn also said that after reading a study on aerospace medicine, he was intrigued at how the physiological changes experienced by the human body in space (such as loss of bone and muscle mass and blood plasma) were {{similar to those of the}} human body as it ages. He regretted that NASA did not continue its research on aging by sending additional elderly people into space. After STS-95 returned safely, its crew received a ticker-tape parade. On October 15, 1998, NASA Road 1 (the main route to the Johnson Space Center) was temporarily renamed John Glenn Parkway for several months. In 2001, Glenn strenuously opposed sending Dennis Tito, the world's first space tourist, to the International Space Station because Tito's trip had no scientific purpose.|$|E
2500|$|Further, Pallett writes, in the song's bridge, Perry adds more {{complexity}} to the song—and {{makes it more}} memorable, in his opinion—by taking the simple step of singing the [...] "let you put your hands <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> my skintight jeans" [...] lyrics entirely on beat, including the reiteration of the song's title. [...] "How brilliant. The title of the song is rhythmically weighted two ways—it's like a flank attack. Two {{sides of the same}} face. You WILL remember the name of this song." ...|$|E
2500|$|Elena {{suffered}} a serious injury when a bone detached itself from her knee. A medical specialist {{told her that}} her injury could be repaired through surgery. Her chances of ever again competing at the highest level would be negligible. In fact it could mean she would never be a gymnast again. Elena took plenty of rest and homeopathic treatments. Her resilience and spirit won through. [...] "When I was injured my coach believed in me and didn't give up <b>on</b> <b>me.</b> <b>In</b> my mind I knew I could still be on the team. I kept going." ...|$|E

2500|$|Arena's autobiography, Now I Can Dance, {{published}} by HarperCollins, {{was released on}} 14 October 2013 in paperback and E-book format. It is billed by HarperCollins as [...] "Honest and intimate, funny and frank, Now I Can Dance is the long-awaited memoir from the very special, much-loved singer, songwriter and pop diva, Tina Arena." [...] She told Kathy McCabe of News Corp Australia that [...] "I don't need to put a book out to {{put food on the}} table. It started to dawn <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> the last year that I have had an unbelievable life and I want people to know it's been hilarious, there's been a lot of laughter in my journey." ...|$|E
2500|$|The song {{became a}} blues standard, and {{renditions}} {{have been performed}} and recorded by numerous artists. [...] Some follow the original arrangement, while others interpret it differently. As early as 1946, a young Ray Charles played it regularly. He recalled, [...] "Charles Brown was a powerful influence <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> {{the early part of}} my career, especially when I was struggling down in Florida. I made many a dollar doing my imitation of his 'Drifting Blues'. That {{was a hell of a}} number". [...] In 1950, Lightnin' Hopkins recorded a different arrangement of the song, accompanied only by his amplified guitar John Lee Hooker recorded a similar adaptation in 1961. Billy Eckstine recorded it in 1959 for the album Basie/Eckstine Incorporated. Chuck Berry recorded his interpretation for his 1960 album Rockin' at the Hops.|$|E
2500|$|Originally, Holmes on Homes ran as {{a series}} of 30-minute episodes (with one one-hour special Whole House Disaster), but moved to a one-hour format midway through the third season due to popular demand.

2500|$|The {{eldest son}} of Victoria went through various {{treatments}} to cure his atrophied arm. Strange methods, {{such as the}} so-called [...] "animal baths" [...] in which the arm was immersed in the entrails of recently dead rabbits, were performed with some regularity. In addition, William also underwent electroshock sessions {{in an attempt to}} revive the nerves passing through the left arm to the neck and also to prevent his head tilting to one side. Vicky insisted that he become a good rider. The thought that he, as heir to the throne, should not be able to ride was intolerable to her. Riding lessons began when William was eight and were a matter of endurance for William. Over and over, the weeping prince was set on his horse and compelled to go through the paces. He fell off time after time but despite his tears was set on its back again. After weeks of this he finally got it right and was able to maintain his balance. William later wrote: [...] "The torments inflicted <b>on</b> <b>me,</b> <b>in</b> this pony riding, must be attributed to my mother." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{influence}} of the moderates on Congress politics began to wane after Gokhale died in 1915. Anti-moderate leaders such as Annie Beasant and Bal Gangadhar Tilak {{took the opportunity to}} call for a national movement for Home Rule. But, in 1915, the proposal was rejected because of the reluctance of the moderates to commit to such a radical course of action. Besant nevertheless formed a league for advocating Home Rule in 1916; and Tilak, on his release from a prison term, had in April 1916 formed his own league. Nehru joined both leagues but worked especially for the former. He remarked later: [...] " [...] had a very powerful influence <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> my childhood... even later when I entered political life her influence continued." [...] Another development which brought about a radical change in Indian politics was the espousal of Hindu-Muslim unity with the Lucknow Pact {{at the annual meeting of}} the Congress in December 1916. The pact had been initiated earlier in the year at Allahabad at a meeting of the All India Congress Committee which was held at the Nehru residence at Anand Bhawan. Nehru welcomed and encouraged the rapprochement between the two Indian communities.|$|E
