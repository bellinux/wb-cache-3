These rockets were three single-stage rockets with a length of 3.4 m and a maximum altitude of 40 km.

30|$|In {{spite of}} its advantages, MC-CDMA shares with other {{multicarrier}} modulations a common problem: the usually high values of the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the transmitted signals. As multicarrier modulations are more sensitive than single carrier systems to nonlinearities in the RF high-power amplifier (HPA) [6], this latter component {{would be required to}} operate with a high output back-off value {{to reduce the risk of}} entering into the nonlinear part of its input-output characteristics. However, raising the back-off dramatically decreases the power efficiency of the HPA, a fact that seriously limits the applicability of multicarrier modulations in battery-operated portable devices and <b>on-board</b> satellite <b>transmitters.</b>|$|R

After a brief presentation of both systems, we study this critical scenario (from the system coexistence viewpoint), by proposing a new approach (different from classical frequency-domain analysis) that takes into account system dynamics and their technology characteristics.

40|$|In {{order to}} provide for the safe {{integration}} of unmanned aircraft systems into the National Airspace System, the control and non-payload communications (CNPC) link connecting the ground-based pilot with the unmanned aircraft must be highly reliable. A specific requirement is that it must operate using aviation safety radiofrequency spectrum. The 2012 World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC- 12) provided a potentially suitable allocation for LOS CNPC spectrum in C-Band at 5030 - 5091 MHz band which, when combined with a previous allocation in L-Band (960 - 1164 MHz) may satisfy the LOS spectrum requirement and provide for high reliability through dual-band redundancy. However, the LBand spectrum hosts a number of aeronautical navigation systems which require high-power <b>transmitters</b> <b>on-board</b> the aircraft. These high-power transmitters co-located with sensitive CNPC receivers operating in the same frequency band have the potential to create co-site interference, reducing the performance of the CNPC receivers and ultimately reducing the usability of the L-Band for CNPC. This paper examines the potential for co-site interference, as highlighted in recent flight tests, and discusses the impact on the UAS CNPC spectrum availability and requirements for further testing and analysis...|$|R
40|$|Strong {{localized}} radar echoes {{have been}} observed at decimeter wavelengths from the highlands of Venus since the earliest radar maps were obtained over 30 years ago. These echoes are some five to ten times stronger than those from the presumably basaltic rocks seen at lower altitudes elsewhere on Venus. Observations of thermal emission from the visible disk of Venus at wavelengths corresponding to those used in the radar mapping confirm that the regions of high reflectivity also exhibit low emissivity, as expected from considerations of detailed thermodynamic balance. Two possibilities have been put forward to explain this unexpected aspect of the Venus highlands: 1) surface materials of high effective dielectric constant, probably associated with finite electrical conductivity, and 2) volume scattering associated with multiple scattering from a layer of very-low-loss material containing voids and extending down a few hundred wavelengths beneath the surface. Analogs to these two mechanisms are found elsewhere in the solar system, and each is capable of explaining the basic observations. as of the early 1990 's. In 1993, however, it became possible {{to carry out a}} bistatic observation of the anomalous highland regions using the Magellan spacecraft, then in orbit about Venus. In this experiment the <b>on-board</b> telemetry <b>transmitter</b> was aimed at the planet's surface with its linear S-band polarization vector oriented at 45 deg to the spacecraft-Venus-Earth scattering plane. The pointing of the transmitting antenna was adjusted so that the spacecraft-to-illuminated-surface incidence angle equalled the Earth-to-Venus-surface incidence angle. In this way, the experiment emphasized the specular scattering component. A full Stokes-Vector analysis of the reflected signal as received on Earth was carried out as the illuminated region scanned across the highland regions of Venus. From the observed position angle of the echo, it was possible to calculate the Fresnel reflectivity of a number of regions on Venus, including the high-altitude Maxwell Montes, and to show unequivocally that the complex dielectric constant of that anomalous area was 100 +/- 50 i, as compared to 4. 0 (real) for the typical lowland area. Thus this experiment was able to rule out definitively an hypothesis of volume scattering as the explanation for the anomalous scattering in the Venus highlands...|$|R

CONSERT is a bistatic radar with receivers and <b>transmitters</b> <b>on-board</b> both Rosetta’s main spacecraft and Philae lander. It has been successfully operating during the descent and First Science Sequence (FSS) right after Philae’s final landing at Abydos. The nucleus in the vicinity of Abydos has been actually sounded by CONSERT’s electromagnetic waves at 90 MHz with a spatial resolution around 10 m (over lengths ranging from approximately 200 to 800 m and maximum depths of about one hundred of meters). The data collected provide information about the permittivity values inside the sounded volume and allows us to retrieve some constraints about the internal structures of the nucleus inside the sounded volume. In this paper, we specifically focus on local variations in the nucleus subsurface permittivity simulated over spatial scales ranging from tens to hundreds of meters. A number of propagation simulations corresponding to the CONSERT operations have been performed for a variety of subsurface permittivity models. The effect of local vertical and horizontal variations of the permittivity values around the landing site as well as comparison with CONSERT’s experimental data collected in the same configurations will be presented and discussed.

40|$|International audienceSince {{the arrival}} of the Rosetta {{spacecraft}} at comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in August 2014, a series of instruments have been observing the surface of the nucleus at distances ranging from more than 10 000 km down to less than one meter. The cameras onboard the Rosetta's main spacecraft (NAVCAM [1], OSIRIS [2]) and Philae lander (CIVA [3], ROLIS [4]) have revealed details of amazing structures giving some very partial hints about the internal structure of the nucleus. This is the case for the a few hundreds-of-meters deep pits [5] linked to the comet's activity; and the layers and terraces [6, 7, 8] revealed by the OSIRIS images. The CONSERT (Comet Nucleus Sounding Experiment by Radiowave Transmission) experiment [9] has been specifically designed to sound the interior of the nucleus and provide information on the nucleus structure at depth. The work presented here is based on the CONSERT data collected during the First Science Sequence and aims at constraining the small scale hetero-geneity inside the volumes investigated by CONSERT.

40|$|International audienceSince {{their arrival}} at comet 67 P in August 2014, {{a number of}} {{instruments}} onboard Rosetta’s main spacecraft and Philae lander have been observing {{the surface of the}} nucleus and revealed details of amazing surficial structures (hundreds of meters deep pits and cliffs, surface roughness of the order of a couple of meters in size, non-continuous apparent layers on both lobes of the comet). After two years of observations, the activity of the comet has also been better constrained, while the origin of sporadic jet activities remains debated. This surficial information is complemented by relevant measurements assessing the nucleus internal structure that have been collected by the CONSERT (Comet Nucleus Sounding Experiment by Radiowave Transmission) experiment in order to constrain the nucleus formation and evolution. The CONSERT experiment is a bistatic radar with receivers and <b>transmitters</b> <b>on-board</b> both Rosetta’s main spacecraft and the Philae lander. The instrument transmits electromagnetic waves at 90 MHz (10 MHz bandwidth) between Philae and Rosetta. The signal propagated through the small lobe of 67 P over distances ranging from approximately 200 to 800 meters depending on the spacecraft location and probed a maximum depth of about one hundred meters {{in the vicinity of the}} final landing site Abydos. The CONSERT data have been used to obtain an estimate of the permittivity mean value. Thanks to the 10 MHz frequency bandwidth of the signal used by the instrument, a spatial resolution around 10 m is obtained inside the sounded volume of the nucleus. In this work, we analyze the effect of internal heterogeneities of 67 P on the CONSERT data by simulating the propagation of the signal through a fractal model of the comet interior. We considered for the simulations a range of realistic permittivity values and characteristic sizes of the material heterogeneities. The different parameters values used have an impact on the width of the signal propagating through the modeled nucleus. Comparison with the values measured by CONSERT will allow us to determine the possible permittivity variations and heterogeneities size compatible with 67 P internal structure...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWith {{receivers}} and <b>transmitters</b> <b>on-board</b> both Rosetta's main spacecraft and the Philae lander, the CONSERT (Comet Nucleus Sounding Experiment by Radiowave Transmission) bistatic radar {{has been}} designed and operated to retrieve information about the internal structure of 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko nucleus [1]. CONSERT was successfully operated during the First Science Sequence (FSS) after Philae's landing on the nucleus. While the CONSERT's primary goal is to perform the tomography of the whole nucleus, in this paper, we specifically focus on the local variations in the nucleus shallow subsurface permittivity over depths ranging from tens to hundreds of meters and investigate a possible difference between the Eastern and Western side of the Philae's landing site. A number of propagation simulations corresponding to the geometrical configurations at grazing angles have been performed {{for a variety of}} subsurface permittivity models. The effect of local vertical and horizontal variations of the permittivity values around the landing site as well as comparison with CONSERT's experimental data collected in the same configurations will be presented and discussed. A possible interpretation of the results will be presented 1. The model for the nucleus' shape and subsurface dielectric properties The nucleus shape model for the simulations is derived from the images of the comet taken by the OSIRIS camera [2]. At CONSERT's 90 MHz frequency, the dielectric properties depend on the porosity, the composition and on the temperature of the nucleus. As a consequence, the data collected by CONSERT should provide information about these parameters values and their spatial variations inside the nucleus. The range of permittivity values we used for this study is based on experimental values available in the literature [3], [4]. These values have been obtained through measurements performed in laboratory on ice/dust mixtures at low temperature and for high porosity values around 70 - 80 % commensurate with the information provided by the other instruments of the Rosetta payload. 2. Simulations tool and results Electromagnetic simulations have been run on these nucleus models to simulate the propagation of the CONSERT waves at 90 MHz between Philae lander and the orbiter. A fast ray tracing method has been used to provide simulated data for a large number of nucleus dielectric constant configurations. It allowed us to study {{of the effects of the}} permittivity spatial variations in the shallow subsurface. We considered a variety of possible features such as: a gradient with depth either positive or negative or a random EPSC European Planetary Science Congress variability of the permittivity. Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 illustrate the propagation of the waves from the lander's location. They show how a permittivity gradient in the shallow sub-surface has a potential strong effect on the wave propagation. In both cases, a permittivity gradient taking place within a 50 -meters layer below the surface has been considered. Fig. 2 corresponds to a decrease of permittivity with depth while Fig. 2 illustrates the effect of an increase of permittivity with depth. In this latter case, the rays' curvature clearly show that the refraction prevents the waves transmitted by the lander to propagate towards some given angular directions, which is consistent with the measurement performed by CONSERT during the FSS. Fig. 1 : Results of the ray tracing method for a permittivity that decreases with depth. The color indicates the dielectric constant value. Fig. 2 : Results of the ray tracing method for a permittivity that increases with depth 3. Conclusions Comparison between simulated data and experimental data allow us to exclude a situation where the permittivity significantly increases with depth and where the mean permittivity value is larger than 1. 3, in agreement with a result obtained for an homogenous nucleus [5] These results can be interpreted in terms of porosity and dust/ice ratio. A preliminary comparison with a model of the subsurface thermal and physical modifications induced by volatiles' sublimation and possible dust crust formation will also be presented...|$|R
