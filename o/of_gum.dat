5|$|Kauri gum was Auckland's main export in {{the second}} half of the 19th century, {{sustaining}} much of the early growth of the city. Between 1850 and 1950, 450,000tons <b>of</b> <b>gum</b> were exported. The peak in the gum market was 1899, with 11,116tons exported that year, with a value of £600,000 ($989,700). The average annual export was over 5,000tons, with the average price gained £63 ($103.91) per ton.|$|E

5|$|Planning for dental {{implants}} {{focuses on}} the general health condition of the patient, the local health condition of the mucous membranes and the jaws and the shape, size, and position of {{the bones of the}} jaws, adjacent and opposing teeth. There are few health conditions that absolutely preclude placing implants although there are certain conditions that can increase the risk of failure. Those with poor oral hygiene, heavy smokers and diabetics are all at greater risk for a variant <b>of</b> <b>gum</b> disease that affects implants called peri-implantitis, increasing the chance of long-term failures. Long-term steroid use, osteoporosis and other diseases that affect the bones can increase the risk of early failure of implants.|$|E

Before dying, O'Grady tells her {{that the only way}} to kill the leprechaun is with a four-leaf clover. Tory returns to the farmhouse, where she {{searches}} for a clover until she is attacked by the leprechaun; Nathan and Ozzie save her. Alex sets a trap near the well, but the leprechaun almost kills him. Ozzie reveals he swallowed the last gold coin, and the leprechaun critically wounds him to get at it. Before the leprechaun can kill Ozzie, Alex takes a four-leaf clover Tory has found, sticks it to a wad <b>of</b> <b>gum,</b> and shoots it into the leprechaun's mouth, taking away his power. The leprechaun falls into the well, but his skeleton climbs out. Nathan pushes the leprechaun back into the well and blows up both the well and leprechaun with gasoline. The police arrive, and Tory is reunited with her father. As the police investigate the remains of the well, the leprechaun vows he will not rest until he recovers every last piece of his gold.|$|E

5|$|Pericoronitis is {{inflammation}} of the soft tissues surrounding the crown of a partially erupted tooth. The lower wisdom tooth is the last tooth to erupt into the mouth, and is, therefore, more frequently impacted, or stuck, against the other teeth. This leaves the tooth partially erupted into the mouth, and there frequently is a flap <b>of</b> <b>gum</b> (an operculum), overlying the tooth. Bacteria and food debris accumulate beneath the operculum, which {{is an area that}} is difficult to keep clean because it is hidden and far back in the mouth. The opposing upper wisdom tooth also tends to have sharp cusps and over-erupt because it has no opposing tooth to bite into, and instead traumatizes the operculum further. Periodontitis and dental caries may develop on either the third or second molars, and chronic inflammation develops in the soft tissues. Chronic pericoronitis may not cause any pain, but an acute pericoronitis episode is often associated with pericoronal abscess formation. Typical signs and symptoms of a pericoronal abscess include severe, throbbing pain, which may radiate to adjacent areas in the head and neck, redness, swelling and tenderness of the gum over the tooth. There may be trismus (difficulty opening the mouth), facial swelling, and rubor (flushing) of the cheek that overlies the angle of the jaw. Persons typically develop pericoronitis in their late teens and early 20s, as this is the age that the wisdom teeth are erupting. Treatment for acute conditions includes cleaning the area under the operculum with an antiseptic solution, painkillers, and antibiotics if indicated. After the acute episode has been controlled, the definitive treatment is usually by tooth extraction or, less commonly, the soft tissue is removed (operculectomy). If the tooth is kept, good oral hygiene is required to keep the area free of debris to prevent recurrence of the infection.|$|E

40|$|Gum arabic {{is widely}} used in the food {{industry}} as an additive, both as a thickener and an emulsifier. This study has compared the emulsification properties of two types <b>of</b> <b>gums,</b> KLTA (Acacia senegal) and GCA (Acacia seyal), both in their native/untreated forms and after exposure to high pressure (800 MPa). Further studies were undertaken to chemically modify the disulphide linkages present and to investigate the effects of their reduction on the diffusion of the carbohydrate materials. The emulsification properties <b>of</b> the <b>gum</b> samples were examined by determining the droplet size distribution in a ‘‘model’’ oil-in-water system. Results showed that high pressure treatment and chemical reduction <b>of</b> <b>gums</b> changed the emulsification properties <b>of</b> both <b>gums.</b> The high molecular weight component in arabinogalactanproteins (AGP/GP), and more ‘‘branched’’ carbohydrates present in gum arabic, {{may be responsible for}} the emulsification properties <b>of</b> GCA <b>gum,</b> indicating that the emulsification mechanisms for KLTA and GCA were different...|$|R

25|$|While {{hydrophobic}} polymers beneficially repel {{water and}} contribute to chewiness, they also detrimentally attract oil. The stickiness <b>of</b> <b>gum</b> results from this hydrophobic nature, as gum can form bonds and stick when it makes contact with oily surfaces such as sidewalks, skin, hair, or the sole of one’s shoe. To make matters worse, unsticking the gum is a challenge because the long polymers of the gum base stretch, rather than break. The sticky characteristic <b>of</b> <b>gum</b> may be problematic during processing if the gum sticks to any machinery or packaging materials during processing, impeding the flow of product. Aside from ensuring that the machinery is free from lipid-based residues, this issue can be combatted by the conditioning and coating <b>of</b> <b>gum</b> {{toward the end of}} the process. By adding either a powder or a coating to the exterior of the gum product, the hydrophobic gum base binds to the added substance instead of various surfaces with which it may come in contact.|$|E

40|$|A journal review <b>of</b> <b>gums</b> <b>of</b> {{industrial}} value. There is {{an increasing}} trend towards the use of available plant resources for food and technological applications. One class of ingredients often exploited for their texturizing capabilities are the plant polysaccharides called the hydrocolloids or gums. These compounds are long chain polymers which dissolve in water to give a thickening or viscosity-building effect. Some of these plant polysaccharides have found applications in the food, pharmaceutical, textile, mining and other industries. The United States Food and Drug Administration regulates gums, classifying these compounds as food additives. Though required at usage levels of less than two percent to achieve the desired properties in food systems, gums have become a big business. In 1991 the market <b>of</b> <b>gums</b> reached 126 metric tons at a worth of $ 748. 7 million. There is an increased awareness of the nutritional importance of polysaccharides. The demand for water-soluble polysaccharide gums including the seaweed extracts, seed gums, plant exudates and cellulose derivatives, has slowly increased {{over the past few}} years along with population growth and the advent of easy to prepare foods.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{concentration}} and temperature influence on the specific heat <b>of</b> xanthan <b>gum</b> and to propose a model equation for estimating the specific heat <b>of</b> xanthan <b>gum</b> at different concentration and temperature usingthe Joules calorimeter method. Joules calorimeter method was tested with distilled water for accuracy and reliability before applying to xanthan gum samples which varied in concentration. The specific heat <b>of</b> xanthan <b>gum</b> needs to be known for evaluating the design and modeling aspects of heat transfer processes of refrigeration, freezing, heating, pasteurization and drying. The specific heat <b>of</b> xanthan <b>gum</b> increases with an increase in temperature (293. 15 - 333. 15 K) and concentration (0. 1 - 0. 6 %w/w). The minimum value of specific heat <b>of</b> xanthan <b>gum</b> was 4. 133 KJ/kg K at 300. 25 K with a concentration of 0. 2 %w/w, whereas the maximum value of specific heat <b>of</b> xanthan <b>gum</b> was 7. 459 KJ/kg K at 333. 95 K with a concentration of 0. 5 %w/w.

25|$|Bubblegum bubbles {{are formed}} when {{the tension and}} {{elasticity}} <b>of</b> <b>gum</b> polymers acts against the constant and equally dispersed pressure of air being directed into the gum bolus. Bubble gum bubbles are circular because pressure from the focused air being directed into the bolus acts equally {{on all of the}} interior surfaces of the gum cud, uniformly pushing outward on all surfaces as the polymers extend. As the bubble expands, the polymers of the gum base stretch and the surface of the bubble begins to thin. When the force of the air being blown into the bubble exceeds the force that the polymers can withstand, the polymers overextend and the bubble pops. Due to the elastic attributes of chewing gum, the deflated bubble recoils and the wad <b>of</b> <b>gum</b> is ready to continue being chewed.|$|E
