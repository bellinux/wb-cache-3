5|$|In Chicago's bid, {{the games}} {{would have been}} held from July 22 to August 7, with the Paralympics held between August 12 and 28. The bid plan {{emphasized}} use of Chicago Park District parks to host the games, but other existing facilities such as Soldier Field and McCormick Place would have hosted events. The bid included a plan for North Side, Downtown Loop and South Side celebration locations that would have had high-definition LED screens for unticketed visitors. The bid noted {{that there was a}} very high concentration <b>of</b> <b>event</b> locations and training facilities close to each other and that the majority <b>of</b> <b>event</b> sites were clustered together. Thus, the vast majority of athletes would have been close to their competitions.|$|E
5|$|Every {{participant}} at the Paralympics {{has their}} disability grouped {{into one of}} five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly {{under one of the}} other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type <b>of</b> <b>event</b> and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.|$|E

5|$|The Tiananmen Square {{self-immolation}} incident {{took place}} in Tiananmen Square in central Beijing, {{on the eve of}} Chinese New Year on 23 January 2001. The incident is disputed; Chinese government sources say that five members of Falun Gong, a spiritual practice that is persecuted in mainland China, set themselves on fire in the square. Falun Gong sources disputed the accuracy of these portrayals, noting that their teachings explicitly forbid violence or suicide. Several Western journalists and scholars also noted inconsistencies in the government's account <b>of</b> <b>event,</b> suggesting the self-immolations were staged by the government to discredit Falun Gong.|$|E

5|$|The {{length of}} time taken for the {{extinction}} to occur is a controversial issue, because some theories about the extinction's causes require a rapid extinction over {{a relatively short period}} (from a few years to a few thousand years) while others require longer periods. The issue is difficult to resolve because of the Signor–Lipps effect; that is, the fossil record is so incomplete that most extinct species probably died out long after the most recent fossil that has been found. Scientists have also found very few continuous beds of fossil-bearing rock that cover a time range from several million years before the K–Pg extinction to a few million years after it. The sedimentation rate and thickness of K-Pg clay from three sites suggest short duration <b>of</b> <b>event,</b> perhaps less than ten thousand years.|$|E
50|$|Uses of a {{sequence}} <b>of</b> <b>events</b> include stories,historical events (chronology), directions and steps in procedures,and timetables for scheduling activities. A sequence <b>of</b> <b>events</b> {{may also be}} used to help describe processes in science, technology, and medicine. A sequence <b>of</b> <b>events</b> may be focused on past events (e.g., stories, history, chronology), on future events that must be in a predetermined order (e.g., plans, schedules, procedures, timetables), or focused on the observation <b>of</b> past <b>events</b> with the expectation that the events will occur in the future (e.g., processes, projections). The use of {{a sequence}} <b>of</b> <b>events</b> occurs in fields as diverse as machines (cam timer), documentaries (Seconds From Disaster), law (choice of law), computer simulation (discrete event simulation), and electric power transmission(sequence <b>of</b> <b>events</b> recorder).

40|$|Both the WHO and the EC advise {{on the use}} of Lnight as {{the primary}} {{indicator}} for sleep disturbance. Still, a key question for noise policy is whether from a public health point of view it may be advantageous to use number <b>of</b> <b>events</b> in addition to Lnight. For some effects, it may be more effective to reduce the number <b>of</b> <b>events</b> above a certain threshold than to lower the overall exposure level <b>of</b> <b>events.</b> Based on data of a field study among 418 people, the current paper investigates the associ-ation between objectively measured sleep disturbance and the number <b>of</b> aircraft noise <b>events.</b> The data from this study are well suited for this purpose, since for eve-ry subject both the number and the level <b>of</b> <b>events</b> were available. The analysis focuses on mean motility during the sleep period, and addresses the question whether this motility can be predicted more accurately taking the number of passages into account. The results suggest that an increase in the average sound exposure level <b>of</b> <b>events</b> contributes more to motility than {{an increase in the number}} <b>of</b> <b>events.</b> However, it was also found that the influence <b>of</b> number <b>of</b> <b>events</b> increases with increas-ing levels <b>of</b> the <b>events.</b> Thus, to reduce motility as a proxy for restless sleep, it may be better to prevent the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>events</b> with high maximum levels than to re-duce the overall number or level <b>of</b> <b>events...</b>|$|R
