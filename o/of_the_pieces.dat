5|$|Besides {{the basic}} moves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces,</b> rules also govern the {{equipment}} used, time control, conduct and ethics of players, accommodations for physically challenged players, and recording of moves using chess notation. Procedures for resolving irregularities {{that can occur}} during a game are provided as well.|$|E
5|$|Reviews of {{the soundtrack}} album were positive, with critics praising both {{the variety of}} styles and quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces.</b> Several critics noted Mizuta's work as {{possibly}} his finest to date. Reviewers of the game were more mixed, with some feeling {{that some of the}} styles of music did not match where they were played in the game. Critics were also mixed in their opinions of the arranged album, feeling that several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> were simply inferior versions of the original tracks. Both of the albums and the single sold well enough to place on the Japanese Oricon charts, with the original soundtrack album reaching a peak of #13 and remaining on the charts for eight weeks.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> {{performance}} time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> is usually around nine minutes, but shorter {{performance time}}s (e.g. 8:15) and execution times of over 10:30 exist. <b>The</b> first section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piece,</b> <b>the</b> Toccata, takes somewhat {{less than a}} third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total performance time.|$|R
5|$|Some of his chansons were doubtless {{designed}} to be performed instrumentally. That Petrucci published many of them without text is strong evidence of this; additionally, some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> (for example, the fanfare-like Vive le roy) contain writing more idiomatic for instruments than voices.|$|E
5|$|Chess {{strategy}} {{is concerned with}} evaluation of chess positions and with setting up goals and long-term {{plans for the future}} play. During the evaluation, players must take into account numerous factors such as the value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> on the board, control of the center and centralization, the pawn structure, king safety, and the control of key squares or groups of squares (for example, diagonals, open files, and dark or light squares).|$|E
5|$|Hubbard wrote all of {{the music}} for the album, with {{contributors}} utilizing instruments including synthesizers, bass, woodwinds, strings, and a bouzouki. She plays piano on the album. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> on the album are of three to four minutes in duration. Wayne Isaak served as the Waterhouse Records publicist for the album. In publicity for the album, marketing compared Hubbard's musical writing style to that of Erik Satie. The album cover was marketed with a sticker on the outside wrapping advertising {{the fact that it}} was endorsed by Stanley Clarke.|$|E

5|$|In 1894, after Smith {{returned}} from Germany, she published her second volume Songs for Little Children, Part 2. As in her previous work, {{most of the}} songs were in major keys with the most common being A-flat major and E-flat major. Second, third, fourth and fifth intervals were typical in her voice scores with the piano accompaniment creating interest through varied rhythm patterns. In this volume, most of the compositions were Smith's own work, though some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> were adaptations of German folk songs.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, {{the museum}} {{director}} Anne Hawley {{received a letter}} that promised the return <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> for $2.6 million. If interested, the museum had to get The Boston Globe to publish a coded message in a business story. The message was published, but the writer disappeared after law enforcement got involved.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, a large {{quantity}} of unissued Morgan dollars {{was discovered in}} the Treasury vaults, including issues once thought rare. Individuals began purchasing large quantities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> at face value, and eventually the Treasury ceased exchanging silver certificates for silver coin. Beginning in the 1970s, the Treasury conducted a sale of silver dollars minted at the Carson City Mint through the General Services Administration. In 2006, Morgan's reverse design was used on a silver dollar issued to commemorate the old San Francisco Mint building.|$|E

5|$|Major {{pieces were}} created at Crawfords Casting foundry in Enfield in Sydney's inner western suburbs. Although the foundry would {{fabricate}} {{the elements of}} the sculptures, Oliver would still undertake the initial stages, training foundry staff and supervising their activity. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> assembled to create the sculptures were made using copper rod, while others were formed using the lost-wax casting technique. Individual pieces would take up to two months to complete.|$|E
5|$|Since 1994, the Crown Jewels {{have been}} {{on display in the}} Jewel House in the Waterloo Block. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> are used {{regularly}} by the Queen.

5|$|Since {{the release}} of the game, Square Enix has {{published}} the 2011 four-disc soundtrack album, Final Fantasy XIII-2 Original Soundtrack, as well as an album of arrangements and alternate versions of tracks from the game, Final Fantasy XIII Original Soundtrack PLUS, in 2012. The theme song for the game, , was released by singer Mai Fukui as a single in 2011, and the English version of the song, sung by Charice Pempengco and included in the non-Japanese versions of the game, was included on her 2012 album Infinity. Reviews of the soundtrack album were positive, with critics praising both the variety of styles and quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces.</b> Several critics noted Mizuta's work as possibly his finest to date. Reviewers were mixed in their opinions of the arranged album, feeling that several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> were simply inferior versions of the original tracks.

50|$|Mockups are {{commonly}} required by designers, architects, and end users for custom furniture and cabinetry. The intention is often {{to produce a}} full-sized replica, using inexpensive materials in order to verify a design. Mockups are often used to determine <b>the</b> proportions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piece,</b> relating to various dimensions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> itself, or to fit <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> into a specific space or room. The ability to see how <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> relates to <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> space {{is also an important}} factor in determining size and design.|$|R

5|$|The cycle {{consists}} of sixteen sonatas (thirteen {{of which are}} cast in binary form, the remaining three in ternary form) and four more freely structured interludes. The aim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> is to express the eight permanent emotions of the rasa Indian tradition. In Sonatas and Interludes, Cage elevated his technique of rhythmic proportions {{to a new level}} of complexity. In each sonata a short sequence of natural numbers and fractions defines the structure of the work and that of its parts, informing structures as localized as individual melodic lines.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} a {{distinct}} royal jewel collection is vague, {{though it is}} believed the jewels have their origin somewhere in the 16thcentury. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> are from overseas and {{were brought to the}} United Kingdom as a result of civil war, coups and revolutions, or acquired as gifts to the monarch. Most of the jewellery dates from the 19th and 20th centuries.|$|E
5|$|Chess {{strategy}} {{consists of}} setting and achieving long-term positioning advantages during the game– for example, {{where to place}} different pieces– while tactics concentrate on immediate maneuver. These {{two parts of the}} chess-playing process cannot be completely separated, because strategic goals are mostly achieved through tactics, while the tactical opportunities are based on the previous strategy of play. A game of chess is normally divided into three phases: opening, typically the first 10 moves, when players move their pieces to useful positions for the coming battle; then middlegame; and last the endgame, when most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> are gone, kings typically take a more active part in the struggle, and pawn promotion is often decisive.|$|E
50|$|In 1947 Eugene Ormandy {{recorded}} his orchestration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> with <b>the</b> Philadelphia Orchestra. <b>The</b> score <b>of</b> Stokowski's arrangement {{was published in}} 1952.

5|$|Eguchi and Matsueda {{are noted}} for {{creating}} mainly jazzy and electronic tracks for the scores they have collaborated on; Eguchi is credited {{for most of}} the electronic music. The soundtrack to The Bouncer, of which Eguchi and Matsueda co-composed a lot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces,</b> featured among other genres rock, electronica, and jazz fusion. A professional pianist, Eguchi often utilizes the piano in his compositions. He has stated that {{most of the time he}} composes and arranges music is at his home studio, where his friends help out by recording acoustic instruments; if the quality of these recordings are not adequate, however, Eguchi replaces them at the company's studio. He has said that by the time he is finished creating the music, he is only sleeping three to four hours a week.|$|E
5|$|In October 2013, GameTrailers {{dedicated}} {{an episode}} of its Pop Fiction series to examining Jackson's involvement with the game. Roger Hector, who previously stated that Jackson's involvement in the game was dropped due to the sexual abuse allegations, stated that any similarities to Jackson's music in Sonic 3 was not intentional on Sega's part. However, an anonymous source involved in the game's development reaffirmed Buxer's statements and said Jackson was involved before the scandals came to light in August 1993, and that his contributions remained in the game with Jackson choosing to remain uncredited. The source specified that the musical theme for Carnival Night Zone was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> Jackson contributed to.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, O'Reilly taught English {{to primary}} school {{children}} in Griffith, {{as well as}} singing—most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> were Irish. At Rylstone he taught book-keeping and business, and {{he was promoted to}} the high school at Kandos. During this time he supplemented his income by travelling from town to town, playing in one-off cricket matches {{at the expense of the}} host's club. He worked on his bosie during the period and regularly dismissed outclassed opposition batsmen. O'Reilly regarded his cricketing isolation as highly beneficial as he regarded coaches to be ill-advised and detrimental to development.|$|E
5000|$|For {{performances}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piece,</b> Reich recommended using {{electronic organs}} with as {{plain and simple}} a timbre as possible, without vibrato, to avoid <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> <b>the</b> instrument itself distracting from the harmonic and rhythmic aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piece.</b> Reich himself employed four Farfisa [...] "mini compact" [...] models.|$|R
5000|$|Tester {{supports}} <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> {{genetically modified}} crops to reduce poverty. In 2002, {{he worked as a}} scientific advisor for a BBC1 drama about GM crops. He subsequently criticized the drama's directors, Alan Rusbridger and Ronan Bennett, stating that they had ignored his criticisms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> and produced a documentary [...] "to inflame uninformed anti-GM hysteria". Rusbridger replied by claiming that Tester had changed his mind since he had been shown a copy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piece's</b> script <b>the</b> previous July, when, according to Rusbridger, his view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> was much less critical.|$|R
