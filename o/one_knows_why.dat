500|$|It was {{announced}} on 7 November 2007 that Abra would again {{be returning to}} Holby City, in spring 2008. Edmondson revealed that [...] "Abra comes back as a patient because some trauma has happened in Africa {{and he will be}} sponging off Ric." [...] Expanding on this, he explained: [...] "Abra’s in a very fragile state, as he’s suffering from post-traumatic stress. He keeps hurting himself, but no <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>why.</b> Ric’s pretty off with Abra at first, but he agrees to let him stay at his place for a week. Abra used to be a nice guy, but he’s horrible now. Something happened to him on his travels, though even I haven’t been told what it is yet. What I do know is that Abra has a huge machete scar on his back... I imagine he’s been though some horror." [...] He has stated that this appearance in the show will last four or five months, and that he doesn't yet know how the character will be written out this time, beyond there being [...] "some kind of mental-health issue." [...] It emerged that Abra had borne witness to a violent attack on the hospital he was working in the Congo, eventually leading to him checking into a psychiatric unit. After being discovered being treated by his own mother, Kyla and Lola Griffin convinced him to discharge himself and return to Ghana. He returned briefly to Holby in December 2008, when he convinced Kyla to move to Ghana with him, proposing marriage to her.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cause of}} the {{accident}} was not established, but the extra passenger and weather at take off did {{not contribute to the}} crash. It was assumed that the pilot was trying to keep in eye contact with the ground in the poor visibility. Verdicts of accidental death were returned for the sixteen victims at the coroner's inquest held at Berkhamsted. The sole survivor, P/O P.D. Cliff, said at the inquest he could not remember anything after boarding the aircraft at Bovingdon. The coroner said that before the aircraft departed [...] "certain things were not done which should have been done. But the question of taking off was entirely a matter for the pilot to decide." [...] "For some reason height was lost – no <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>why,</b> no one will ever know. That caused the unfortunate crash. There was nothing wrong with the engines." ...|$|E
2500|$|Richard had to {{come down}} from the North, where he had lived very happily for many years, to fulfil Edward IV's wish that he rule as Lord Protector of the Realm. It was the Plantagenet {{tradition}} that a future king would stay in the royal apartments of the Tower of London while awaiting his coronation. It only became the [...] "Bloody Tower" [...] during the Tudor era. No <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>why</b> the [...] "princes in the tower" [...] disappeared or what happened to them. Richard took the throne by an Act of Parliament and with relatively little bloodshed for the times, new evidence having been presented to him claiming that Edward IV's marriage to Queen Elizabeth (Elizabeth Woodville) had been bigamous. Richard did not murder his own wife; she is thought to have died of tuberculosis. There is no surviving evidence to suggest that he planned to marry his niece, Elizabeth of York; he was negotiating a marriage for Elizabeth with a Portuguese prince, Manuel, Duke of Beja (later Manuel I of Portugal).|$|E

2500|$|Boba Fett is a [...] "cult figure" [...] {{and one of}} {{the most}} popular Star Wars characters. In 2008, Boba Fett was {{selected}} by Empire magazine as the 79th greatest movie character of all time, and he is included on Fandomanias list of The 100 Greatest Fictional Characters. IGN ranked Boba Fett as the eighth top Star Wars character, due to his status as a fan-favourite and cult following. He personifies [...] "danger and mystery", and Susan Mayse calls Fett [...] "the unknowable Star Wars character" [...] who [...] "delivers mythic presence." [...] Although Tom Bissell asserts that no <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>why</b> Boba Fett has become so popular, nor cares why, both Lucas and Bulloch cite Fett's mysterious nature as reasons for his popularity. Bulloch, who has never fully understood the character's popularity, attributes it to the costume and the respect Fett garners from Darth Vader and Jabba the Hutt. The initial Boba Fett toy, more than Fett's actual film appearance, might be responsible for the character's popularity; Henry Jenkins suggests children's play helped the character [...] "take on a life of its own". Moran said Vader's admonition specifically to Fett in The Empire Strikes Back— [...] "No disintegrations"— gives Fett credibility; he was interested in Fett because the character is [...] "strong, silent, [...] brutal". Jeter says that even when Fett appears passive, he conveys [...] "capability and ruthlessness". Bissell credits Bulloch for giving Fett [...] "effortless authority" [...] in his first scene in The Empire Strikes Back, using such nuances as [...] "cradling" [...] his blaster and slightly cocking his head. Fett's small role in The Empire Strikes Back may actually have made the character seem more intriguing. Logan, who was a Young Artist Award nominee for his portrayal of Fett, compares Fett to [...] "that boy in school who never talks" [...] and who attracts others' curiosity.|$|E

60|$|As I said, {{they had}} no plan left now.

They followed some God-given instinct, undiscoverable now by us. Ataulf, Alaric's kinsman, married Placidia, the Emperor's beautiful young sister, and accepted from him some sort of commission to fight against his enemies in Gaul. So to the south of Gaul they went, and then into Spain, crushing before them Alans, Sueves, and Vandals, and quarrelling among themselves. Ataulf was murdered, and all his children; Placidia put to shame. Then she had her revenge. To me {{it is not so much}} horrible as pitiful.

It is a real laurel-grove. Some of the trees must be immemorial, and deserve to have been sacred, if once they were not so.

The people are very fond of this grove, and make frequent processions there. Once a year they must be headed by their priest. No <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>why,</b> nor has he the slightest idea of the reason of the various ceremonies which he that day performs. But we know, and some day he or his successors will equally understand them. Yes, if I remain here long enough--and I sometimes think I will never again quit the isle--I shall expect some fine summer night, when there is that rich stillness which the whispering waves only render more intense, to hear a voice of music on the mountains declaring that the god Pan has returned to earth." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now the opossums are {{unlike most}} mammals {{in that they}} possess two bones {{attached}} to the fore part of the pelvis, which are commonly called [...] "marsupial bones." [...] The name is a misnomer, originally conferred because {{it was thought that}} these bones {{have something to do with}} the support of the pouch, or marsupium, with which some, but not all, of the opossums are provided. As a matter of fact, they have nothing to do with the support of the pouch, and they exist as much in those opossums which have no pouches as in those which possess them. In truth, no one knows what the use of these bones may be, nor has any valid theory of their physiological import yet been suggested. And if we have no knowledge of the physiological importance of the bones themselves, it is obviously absurd to pretend that we are able to give physiological reasons why the presence of these bones is associated with certain peculiarities of the teeth and of the jaws. If any <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>why</b> four molar teeth and an inflected angle of the jaw are very generally found along with marsupial bones, he has not yet communicated that knowledge to the world.|$|E

60|$|Two {{minutes later}} the girls, Ned, and Dick came into the dining-room, and the party sat down to luncheon--a meal always called tiffin in India. It is a great mistake to suppose that people in India cannot eat because of the heat; in the extreme heat of summer their appetites do, no doubt, fall off; but at other times, they not only eat, but eat more largely than is good for them; {{and a good deal}} of the liver {{complaint}} which is the pest of India is in no small degree due to the fact that, the appetite being unnaturally stimulated by hot and piquant food, people eat more than in such a climate as this can be properly digested. The meal consisted of curries, with which were handed round chutney and Bombay ducks--a little fish about the size of a smelt, cut open, dried, and smoked with assafoetida, giving it an intolerably nasty taste to strangers, but one which Anglo-Indians become accustomed to and like--no <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>why</b> they are called Bombay ducks--cutlets, plantains sliced and fried, pomegranates, and watermelons. They were waited upon by two servants, both dressed entirely in white, but wearing red turbans, very broad and shallow. These turbans denoted the particular tribe and sect to which their wearers belonged. The castes in India are almost innumerable, and each has a turban of a peculiar color or shape, and by these they can be at once distinguished by a resident. On their foreheads were lines and spots of a yellowish white paint, indicating also their caste, and the peculiar divinity to whose worship they were specially devoted. On their feet they wore slippers, and were as noiseless as cats in all their movements. There are no better or more pleasant waiters in the world than the natives of Hindostan.|$|E
60|$|I {{was ashamed}} of him. And yet that was not fair, for {{how could he be}} {{expected}} to know this marvelous child in these few weeks, when we who thought we had known her all her life were daily seeing the clouds uncover some new altitudes of her character whose existence was not suspected by us before? But we are all that way: when we know a thing we have only scorn for other people who don't happen to know it. And I {{was ashamed of}} these courtiers, too, for the way they licked their chops, so to speak, as envying Joan her great chance, they not knowing her any better than the King did. A blush began to rise in Joan's cheeks at the thought that she was working for her country for pay, and she dropped her head and tried to hide her face, as girls always do when they find themselves blushing; no <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>why</b> they do, but they do, and the more they blush the more they fail to get reconciled to it, and the more they can't bear to have people look at them when they are doing it. The King made it a great deal worse by calling attention to it, which is the unkindest thing a person can do when a girl is blushing; sometimes, when there is a big crowd of strangers, it is even likely to make her cry if she is as young as Joan was. God knows the reason for this, it is hidden from men. As for me, I would as soon blush as sneeze; in fact, I would rather. However, these meditations are not of consequence: I will go on with what I was saying. The King rallied her for blushing, and this brought {{up the rest of the}} blood and turned her face to fire. Then he was sorry, seeing what he had done, and tried to make her comfortable by saying the blush was exceeding becoming to her and not to mind itwhich caused even the dog to notice it now, so of course the red in Joan's face turned to purple, and the tears overflowed and ran downI could have told anybody that that would happen. The King was distressed, and saw that the best thing to do would be to get away from this subject, so he began to say the finest kind of things about Joan's capture of the Tourelles, and presently when she was more composed he mentioned the reward again and pressed her to name it. Everybody listened with anxious interest to hear what her claim was going to be, but when her answer came their faces showed that the thing she asked for was not what they had been expecting.|$|E

5000|$|Hudibras {{gave rise}} to a {{particular}} verse form, commonly called the [...] "Hudibrastic." [...] The Hudibrastic is poetry in closed rhyming couplets in iambic tetrameter, where the rhymes are often feminine rhymes or unexpected conjunctions. For example, Butler describes the English Civil War as a time which [...] "Made men fight like mad or drunk/ For dame religion as for punk/ Whose honesty all durst swear for/ Tho' not <b>one</b> <b>knew</b> <b>why</b> or wherefore" [...] ("punk" [...] meaning a prostitute). The strained and unexpected rhymes increase the comic effect and heighten the parody. This formal indication of satire proved to separate one form of mock-heroic from the others. After Butler, Jonathan Swift is the most notable practitioner of the Hudibrastic, as he used that form for almost all of his poetry.|$|R
