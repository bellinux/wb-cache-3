40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the research of}} noise level monitoring at the Zagreb Airport Ltd. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to show how the aircraft noise sources can be used as a tool for aircraft detection and for increasing flight safety. The noise measurement was made at the Zagreb Airport by using its professional noise monitoring system. The research has led to new findings, such as determining the aircraft model by measuring the noise level generated by an aircraft during final approach based on its frequency spectrum, as the connectivity from the airportâ€™s side to the radar data was unavailable (only ATC). In addition, it is possible to determine the aircraft altitude and, perhaps most significantly, the increase of flight safety through the detection of potential failures on the aircraft structure and/or engine during the <b>overflight</b> of a <b>noise</b> monitoring terminal...|$|R
40|$|A {{decrease}} {{in the level of}} sound events can compensate for an increase in the level of other events, but noise metrics assume different tradeoffs. Noise metrics also differ in the penalty applied to noise in the evening and to noise in the night, and in the definition of these periods. These two aspects of noise metrics, i. e., the tradeoff and the penalty for the nighttime (23 - 7 h), are investigated. A general model of the relation between SELs of sound events (aircraft <b>overflights)</b> and <b>noise</b> annoyance is presented which allows {{for a wide range of}} tradeoffs and time-of-day penalties. The (tradeoff and time-of-day penalty) parameters of the model are fitted to the data from an aircraft noise study conducted around Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, which is especially suited for investigating the tradeoff and time- of-day penalties. It was found that in this study the tradeoff between the levels of events in metrics based on L(Aeq) 's, such as L(Aeq) (24 h), DNL, and DENL, is approximately correct for the prediction of noise annoyance. Furthermore, it was found that the strongest correlation with annoyance is obtained with a nighttime penalty of circa 10 dB. No suitable data were available for further tests of the tradeoff. The result with respect to the nighttime penalty was weakly further supported by the outcome of analyses of the original data from four other aircraft noise surveys (one survey conducted around British airports, and three coordinated surveys carried out around Paris Orly, Amsterdam Schiphol, and Glasgow Abbotsinch).

40|$|A pilot study, {{conducted}} to evaluate procedures {{for measuring the}} noise impact and community response to general aviation aircraft around Torrance Municipal Airport, a typical large GA airport, employed Torrance Airport's computer-based aircraft noise monitoring system, which includes nine permanent monitor stations surrounding the airport. Some 18 residences near these monitor stations were equipped with digital noise level recorders to measure indoor noise levels. Residents were instructed to fill out annoyance diaries for periods of 5 - 6 days, logging the time of each annoying aircraft <b>overflight</b> <b>noise</b> event and judging its degree of annoyance on a seven-point scale. Among the noise metrics studied, the differential between outdoor maximum A-weighted noise level of the aircraft and the outdoor background level showed the best correlation with annoyance; this correlation was clearly seen at only high noise levels, And was only slightly better than that using outdoor aircraft noise level alone. The results indicate that, on a national basis, a telephone survey coupled with outdoor noise measurements would provide an efficient and practical means of assessing the noise impact of general aviation aircraft...|$|E
40|$|The {{short-term}} behavioural {{effects of}} helicopter overflights on breeding king penguins Aptenodytes patagonicus at South Georgia were examined. Seventeen helicopter overflights {{were made at}} altitudes between 230 and 1, 768 m (750 - 5, 800 ft) above ground level. Noise from the aircraft engines and helicopter blades increased sound levels in the colony from a background level of 65 - 69 dB(A) to a maximum mean peak level of 80 dB(A) during overflights. Penguin behaviour changed significantly during all overflights at all altitudes compared to the pre- and post-flight periods. Pre-overflight behaviour resumed within 15 min of the aircraft passing overhead and no chicks or eggs were observed to be taken by predators during overflights. Non-incubating birds showed an increased response with reduced overflight altitude, {{but this was not}} observed in incubating birds. Variability in <b>overflight</b> <b>noise</b> levels did not affect significantly the behaviour of incubating or non-incubating birds. Penguins exhibited a reduced response to overflights as the study progressed (despite later flights generally being flown at lower altitudes) suggesting some degree of habituation to aircraft. To minimise disturbance to king penguins we recommend a precautionary approach such that overflights are undertaken at the maximum altitude that is operationally practical, or preferably are avoided altogether...|$|E
40|$|Community {{opposition}} to the noise concentration from precise NextGen Performance-Based Navigation (PBN) aircraft arrival and departure procedures poses a significant threat {{to the future of}} these procedures in the U. S. National Airspace System. A substantial number of complaints concerning airport noise come from locations outside the 65 dB Day-Night Level (DNL) contour considered the significant noise exposure threshold in U. S. federal regulation. This indicates that this threshold does not sufficiently capture areas that experience annoyance related to more concentrated, lower level <b>overflight</b> <b>noise</b> at distances farther from the airport. This thesis assesses the effectiveness by which different noise analysis methods capture the locations of these airport noise complaints through examination of the noise exposure for three representative scenarios at Boston Logan International Airport using DNL and number of overflights above a noise threshold (Nabove) metrics. The three scenarios examined include the standard noise analysis methodology scenario (annual average day) as well as a day of heavy usage of a noise-sensitive runway (33 L for departures), and a scenario representing a peak hour of departures on this runway. The results indicate that the 33 L peak day scenario does a better job of capturing a substantial fraction of the complainants sensitive to the 33 L departure trajectories (66 %- 87 % at the 45 dB- 5 OdB DNL thresholds) than the standard annual average day scenario. Results for the 33 L peak day scenario indicate that the Nabove metric is also effective at capturing noise complaints at the 60 dB day/ 50 dB night noise threshold at exposure rates in the 25 - 50 overflight range (78 %- 84 % complainant capture). by Morrisa Adelle Brenner.

40|$|A multi-stressor risk {{assessment}} {{was conducted at}} Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona, as {{a demonstration of the}} Military Ecological Risk Assessment Framework. The focus of the assessment was a testing program at Cibola Range, which involved an Apache Longbow helicopter firing Hellfire missiles at moving targets, that is, M 60 -A 1 tanks. This article focuses on the wildlife {{risk assessment}} for the helicopter overflight. The primary stressors were sound and the view of the aircraft. Exposure to desert mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus crooki) was quantified using Air Force sound contour programs NOISEMAP and MR NMAP, which gave very different results. Slant distance from helicopters to deer was also used as a measure of exposure that integrated risk from sound and view of the aircraft. Exposure-response models for the characterization of effects consisted of behavioral thresholds in sound exposure level or maximum sound level units or slant distance. Available sound thresholds were limited for desert mule deer, but a distribution of slant-distance thresholds was available for ungulates. The risk characterization used a weight-of-evidence approach and concluded that risk to mule deer behavior from the Apache overflight is uncertain, but that no risk to mule deer abundance and reproduction is expected.

40|$|Abstract The {{extensive}} literature {{documenting the}} ecological effects of roads has repeatedly implicated noise {{as one of}} the causal factors. Recent studies of wildlife responses to noise have decisively identified changes in animal behaviors and spatial distributions that are caused by noise. Collectively, this research suggests that spatial extent and intensity of potential noise impacts to wildlife can be studied by mapping noise sources and modeling the propagation of noise across landscapes. Here we present models of energy extraction, aircraft <b>overflight</b> and roadway <b>noise</b> as examples of spatially extensive sources and to present tools available for landscape scale investigations. We focus these efforts in US National Parks (Mesa Verde, Grand Teton and Glacier) to highlight that ecological noise pollution is not a threat restricted to developed areas and that many protected natural areas experi-ence significant noise loads. As a heuristic tool for understanding past and future noise pollution we forecast community noise utilizing a spatially-explicit land-use change model that depicts the intensity of human development at sub-county resolution. For road noise, we transform effect distances from two studies into sound levels to begin a discussion of noise thresholds for wildlife. The spatial scale of noise exposure is far larger than any protected area, and no site in the continental US is free form noise. The design of observational and experimental studies of noise effects should be informed by knowledge of regional noise exposure patterns...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This {{research}} on military aviation noise was conducted because the personnel working with military aircraft {{were concerned about}} noise induced hearing damage. In addition, comprehensive data on hearing impairments and occupational exposure of military pilots in the Finnish Air Force was not available. Moreover, data {{on the effects of}} <b>overflight</b> <b>noise</b> of military jets was necessary for the evaluation of noise induced hearing deteriorations of members of the public who might be exposured accidentally for the low-level jets' overflights. The averaged noise exposure levels of pilots varied during a flight from 97 dB(A) to 106 dB(A) in the cockpit and from 83 dB(A) to 100 dB(A) at the entrance of the ear canal. Radio noise was 4 â€“ 10 dB higher than background noise inside the helmet. The attenuation provided by air crew helmets varied from 10 to 21 dB(A) in the laboratory, and was at the same level during real flights. The attenuation measured in the laboratory and in working conditions was about 30 dB(A) for earmuffs. An active noise cancellation (ANC) device decreased averaged noise exposure (LAeq 8 min) 4 â€“ 8 dB over the noise attenuation of the same helmets when the ANC system was off. The noise of overflights by military jets were measured and the noise levels were lower than those known to cause the permanent threshold shifts. However, noise induced hearing damages might be possible in certain conditions. In order to assess the hearing loss risk of pilots, hearing thresholds were measured before and after one flight using both conventional and extended high frequency (EHF) audiometry. Minor temporary threshold shifts (TTS) were revealed. The risk of noise-induced damage at the studied exposure levels is, in all probability, rather small. A novel NoiseScan data management system proved to be an interesting tool in assessment of the risk of developing hearing impairment on the basis of known risk factors. Due to the small number of risk factors, the hearing of pilots was shown to be at considerably less risk than that of industrial workers in Finland...|$|E
