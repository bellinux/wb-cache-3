5|$|She was {{assigned}} {{to try to stop}} the MTV Movie Awards from featuring a South Park satire which poked fun at Scientology and the film based on a book by its founder L. Ron Hubbard, titled Battlefield Earth. Christman repeatedly called the New York City office of MTV in an attempt to get them to stop the satire from airing. In the eventual broadcast, which ran June 8, 2000, the South Park character Cartman was shown using a Scientology personality test as toilet paper. Christman believed she had succeeded in her mission, for she thought that her efforts prevented the book Dianetics from being used by Cartman, instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>personality</b> test.|$|E

25|$|Buddhism aims at {{liberation from}} {{the cycle of}} rebirth by {{self-control}} through meditation and morally just behaviour. Some Buddhist paths aim at a gradual development and transformation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>personality</b> toward Nirvana, like the Theravada stages of enlightenment. Others, like the Japanese Rinzai Zen tradition, emphasize sudden insight, but nevertheless also prescribe intensive training, including meditation and self-restraint.|$|E
25|$|In the {{relatively}} long chapter The Types of Meditation, Meher Baba makes very elaborate classifications {{of the various}} types of meditation. He makes three different types of classifications: one based on their functionality in spiritual advancement, one according to the predominant part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>personality</b> that is involved in the process and one on the basis of items of experiences pondered.|$|E
25|$|As a {{religious}} position, some describe pantheism as the polar opposite of atheism. From this standpoint, pantheism {{is the view}} that everything {{is part of an}} all-encompassing, immanent God. All forms of reality may then be considered either modes of that Being, or identical with it. Some hold that pantheism is a non-religious philosophical position. To them, pantheism is the view that the Universe (in the sense of the totality of all existence) and God are identical (implying a denial <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>personality</b> and transcendence of God).|$|E

25|$|Two {{questionnaires}} were devised by Cloninger {{to measure the}} temperaments and characters of individuals. RD can be measured using both the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ) personality test and by the newer and refined version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>personality</b> test called Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) and its revised version (TCI-R). Owing to the limitations encountered in the TPQ, in that the three dimensions’ clinical utility was not readily apparent to many clinicians, Cloninger revamped the questionnaire and produced the TCI scale, which incorporates four dimensions of “temperament” and three dimensions of “character”.|$|E
25|$|There are {{distinct}} and notably large differences between Borderline and C-PTSD {{and while there}} are some similarities – predominantly in terms of issues with attachment (though this plays out in completely different ways) and trouble regulating strong emotional effect (often feel pain vividly), the disorders are completely different in nature – especially considering that C-PTSD is always a response to trauma rather than a personality disorder. In addition, C-PTSD is not a personality disorder – rather it is often a case of survival reactions to trauma becoming a fundamental aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>personality,</b> in response to living with a personality disordered individual.|$|E
25|$|Narcissistic {{personality}} disorder affects an estimated 1% {{of the general}} population. Although most individuals have some narcissistic traits, high levels of narcissism can manifest themselves in a pathological form as narcissistic {{personality disorder}} (NPD), whereby the patient overestimates his or her abilities and has an excessive need for admiration and affirmation. A revision of NPD {{took place in the}} DSM-5. In this revision, NPD saw dramatic changes to its definition. The general move towards a dimensional (personality trait-based) view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Personality</b> Disorders has been maintained. Some narcissists may have a limited or minimal capability to experience emotions.|$|E

25|$|Once the {{horoscope}} {{has been}} constructed {{the process of}} interpretation can begin, which involves building a complete picture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>personality</b> of the subject, or native. Interpretation involves three main steps: noting the important features of the chart, and the processes of chart weighting and chart shaping. Chart weighting involves noting the distribution of zodiac signs and houses in the chart, and {{the significance of this}} to the overall personality of the native. Chart shaping involves assessing the placement of the planets by aspect and position in the chart, and noting any significant patterns which occur between them.|$|E
25|$|Although Theravada {{does not}} {{acknowledge}} {{the existence of}} a theistic Absolute, it does postulate Nirvana as a transcendent reality which may be attained. It further stresses transformation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>personality</b> through meditative practice, self-restraint, and morally just behaviour. According to Richard H. Jones, Theravada is a form of mindful extrovertive and introvertive mysticism, in which the conceptual structuring of experiences is weakened, and the ordinary sense of self is weakened. It is best known in the west from the Vipassana movement, a number of branches of modern Theravāda Buddhism from Burma, Laos, Thailand and Sri Lanka, and includes contemporary American Buddhist teachers such as Joseph Goldstein and Jack Kornfield.|$|E
25|$|Humanistic {{psychology}} {{developed in}} the 1950s as a movement within academic psychology, in reaction to both behaviorism and psychoanalysis. The humanistic approach sought to glimpse the whole person, not just fragmented parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>personality</b> or isolated cognitions. Humanism focused on uniquely human issues, such as free will, personal growth, self-actualization, self-identity, death, aloneness, freedom, and meaning. It emphasized subjective meaning, rejection of determinism, and concern for positive growth rather than pathology. Some founders of the humanistic school of thought were American psychologists Abraham Maslow, who formulated a hierarchy of human needs, and Carl Rogers, who created and developed client-centered therapy. Later, positive psychology opened up humanistic themes to scientific modes of exploration.|$|E

25|$|One {{man who has}} {{encountered}} this problem is Taiwanese politician Yu Shyi-kun, due to the rarity of the last character in his name. Newspapers have dealt with this problem in varying ways, including using software to combine two existing, similar characters, including a picture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>personality,</b> or, especially {{as is the case}} with Yu Shyi-kun, simply substituting a homophone for the rare character in the hope that the reader would be able to make the correct inference. Taiwanese political posters, movie posters etc. will often add the bopomofo phonetic symbols next to such a character. Japanese newspapers may render such names and words in katakana instead of kanji, and it is accepted practice for people to write names for which they are unsure of the correct kanji in katakana instead.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea of a}} {{planetary}} collision was inspired by websites with theories about such events. Von Trier decided from the outset {{that it would be}} clear from the beginning that the world would actually end in the film, so audiences would not be distracted by the suspense of not knowing. The concept of the two sisters as main characters developed via an exchange of letters between von Trier and the Spanish actress Penélope Cruz. Cruz wrote that she would like to work with von Trier, and spoke enthusiastically about the play The Maids by Jean Genet. As von Trier subsequently tried to write a role for the actress, the two maids from the play evolved into the sisters Justine and Claire in Melancholia. Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>personality</b> of the character Justine was based on von Trier himself. The name was inspired by the 1791 novel Justine by Marquis de Sade.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{aggressiveness}} stereotype is less true today, {{the personality}} of the Doberman Pinscher is unique. There {{is a great deal of}} scientific evidence that Doberman Pinschers have a number of stable psychological traits, such as certain personality factors and intelligence. As early as 1965, studies have shown that there are several broad behavioral traits that significantly predict behavior and are genetically determined. Subsequently, there have been numerous scientific attempts to quantify canine personality or temperament by using statistical techniques for assessing personality traits in humans. These studies often vary in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>personality</b> factors they focus on, and in terms of ranking breeds differently along these dimensions. One such study found that Doberman Pinschers, compared to other breeds, rank high in playfulness, average in curiosity/fearlessness, low on aggressiveness, and low on sociability. Another such study ranked Doberman Pinschers low on reactivity/surgence, and high on aggression/disagreeableness and openness/trainability.|$|E
