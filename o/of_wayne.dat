5|$|For Batman Begins, Nolan {{preferred}} traditional stuntwork over computer-generated imagery. Scale {{models were}} used to represent the Narrows and Ra's al Ghul's temple. There were, however, several establishing shots that were CG composite images; that is, an image composed of multiple images. Examples include Gotham's skyline, exterior shots <b>of</b> <b>Wayne</b> Tower, {{and some of the}} exterior monorail shots. The climactic monorail sequence mixed live action footage, model work, and CGI.|$|E
5|$|Following the battle, Wayne ordered Scott's {{volunteers to}} conduct {{numerous}} raids within a fifty-mile radius of their position. Due {{to a lack}} of pack horses in Wayne's force, the mounted volunteers were also employed transporting supplies between forts throughout September 1794. They eventually grew weary of garrison duty and complained that the use of their personal horses to transport goods had injured the animals. Many threatened to mutiny if not discharged. On October 13, 1794, Wayne finally ordered them home. In a commendation <b>of</b> <b>Wayne</b> issued on December 4, 1794, the U.S. House of Representatives specifically thanked Scott and his men for their service at the Battle of Fallen Timbers. The Treaty of Greenville formally ended the war in mid-1795.|$|E

The freeway intersects I-96 (Jeffries Freeway) and M-10 (Lodge Freeway) on the West Side, passing the main campus <b>of</b> <b>Wayne</b> State University {{before entering the}} East Side at M-1 (Woodward Avenue). Immediately east of the interchange with I-75 (Chrysler Freeway), I-94 forms the southern border of the Milwaukee Junction district. The Edsel Ford Freeway continues through residential neighborhoods of Detroit's East Side. The Interstate turns more northerly, mimicking the shoreline of Lake St. Clair, and exits Detroit for Harper Woods. Just north of the interchange for M-102 (Vernier Road), the freeway crosses 8Mile Road and enters Macomb County.|$|E
5|$|Ithan Creek {{rises in}} a small valley just south of U.S. Route 30 in the {{community}} <b>of</b> <b>Wayne,</b> Pennsylvania. It flows west for several tenths of a mile before receiving its first tributary, Browns Run, from the right and turning south. The creek passes under Pennsylvania Route 320 and receives two small unnamed tributaries from the left. It flows alongside Interstate 476 and crosses it once. After a short while, it receives Kirks Run from the right near the community of Rosemont, Pennsylvania. It flows alongside the interstate for several tenths of a mile before passing under it again. Shortly thereafter, Ithan Creek enters Haverford Township, Pennsylvania and receives its largest tributary, Meadowbrook Run. It passes under Darby Road and meets its confluence with Darby Creek.|$|E

5|$|The Red Wings {{have also}} made the number 6 of Larry Aurie and the number 16 of Vladimir Konstantinov no longer {{available}} for issue. However, the numbers are {{not considered to be}} officially retired. Although Aurie's uniform was retired in 1938 by James E.

5|$|Heskey's {{place in}} the England squad had been placed under {{scrutiny}} in 2003 with the emergence <b>of</b> <b>Wayne</b> Rooney into the England squad. However, despite being criticised for his lack of international goals, he continued to {{be an integral part}} of the international squad and took over the captaincy from Michael Owen after he was substituted when England beat Serbia and Montenegro 2–1 in his hometown of Leicester in June 2003. Heskey was named in the England squad for UEFA Euro 2004, but failed to perform well, and was the subject of much criticism. He came on as a substitute while England were leading 1–0 against France and fouled Claude Makélélé on the edge of the penalty area, giving away a direct free kick from which France equalised. England eventually lost 2–1.|$|E
5000|$|In 2011, the Halsey Institute of Contemporary Art at the College of Charleston {{mounted a}} five year survey <b>of</b> <b>Wayne's</b> recent work.

5|$|With the O.T.O. {{now being}} revived in North America, Smith founded the Agape Lodge No. 1, based at his Hollywood home, {{and brought in}} 7 initiates to the Minerval level in September 1935. He advertised the {{foundation}} of his group through an advert in American Astrology magazine and printed a pamphlet explaining what the O.T.O. was. The Agape Lodge held regular meetings, lectures, and study classes, {{as well as social}} events and a weekly Gnostic Mass open to the public. In February 1936 they held a Mass in honour <b>of</b> <b>Wayne</b> Walker, a proponent of New Thought who ran a group known as The Voice of Healing; they had hoped to attract Walker and his supporters to Thelema, but they were put off by the Lodge's sexual openness. Later that year, Smith and Jacobi's employer, the Southern California Gas Company, discovered their involvement in the Lodge, demoting Smith to bookkeeper and firing Jacobi. Angered, Jacobi left the Lodge altogether, while Smith shut down the group's private ritual activities for the next three years. As a result, the public attendance of the Gnostic Mass plummeted.|$|E

5|$|Groesbeck Highway runs {{northeast}} from Hoover Street crossing out <b>of</b> <b>Wayne</b> County into Macomb County at 8 Mile Road. The trunkline here is {{parallel to}} railroad tracks through Warren. M-97 crosses Interstate 696 (I-696) at an interchange located on the Warren–Roseville line. This interchange is also located at the 11 Mile Road location in the Mile Road System. M-97 crosses through {{the southeast corner of}} Fraser between 13 Mile and 14 Mile roads after which it enters Clinton Township. There is a major intersection with Metropolitan Parkway, which is a limited access county primary road that occupies the 16 Mile location Detroit Mile Road System. Between this intersection and Harrington Street, Groesbeck Highway curves around to the north, crossing the Clinton River and the railroad then entering Mt. Clemens. M-97 continues to curve around the west side of downtown Mt. Clemens before re-entering Clinton Township. Groesbeck Highway and M-97 ends at M-59/Hall Road, another limited access county primary road in Macomb County located in place of 20 Mile Road.

5|$|In {{the city}} of Romulus, I-275 begins {{to take on a}} more {{suburban}} character when it passes the southwestern boundary of the Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport. There is access to {{the south side of the}} airport signed at Eureka Road and to the north side at I-94. Between these two interchanges, I-275 begins to run to the northwest.

Near these two complexes, the freeway turns north again, running parallel and to the east of Haggerty Road. The freeway crosses over another NS railroad line also used by Amtrak trains from Chicago and Pontiac, US12 (Michigan Avenue) and M-153 (Ford Road) in Canton. I-275 crosses the Lower Branch of the River Rouge north of Michigan Avenue and the Middle Branch north of Ford Road, and it also crosses over a CSX line again. North of the Middle Branch of the River Rouge in Plymouth Township, I-275 crosses Schoolcraft Road and another CSX line from Detroit.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} system of New Jersey state highways, present-day U.S. Route 202 was legislated as pre-1927 Route 5 between Morristown and Morris Plains in 1916 and as pre-1927 Route 16 between Somerville and Morristown in 1921. In 1927, the current route was designated as Route 29 between Lambertville and Ringoes, Route 30 (now Route 31) between Ringoes and Flemington, Route 12 between Flemington and Somerville, Route 31 (now U.S. Route 206) between Somerville and Bedminster, Route 32 between Bedminster and Mountain View, and Route 23 within a portion <b>of</b> <b>Wayne.</b> Meanwhile, US122 {{was signed in}} New Jersey to run from the New Hope-Lambertville Bridge in Lambertville, where the route continued south to State Road, Delaware, along Bridge Street, Route 29, and Route 30 to Flemington, and then along present-day County Route 523 (CR523) to US22 in White House. In the mid-1930s, US122 was renumbered to US202, and realigned to follow its current route to New York border near Suffern, New York where it continued to Bangor, Maine. In 1953, all the state highway designations were removed from US202 except for Route 23 and Route 30 (which became Route 69 before becoming Route 31 in 1967) to avoid long concurrencies with the route. In the 1960s, plans were made to upgrade US202 to a freeway between the Pennsylvania border and I-287 in Bridgewater Township. The only parts of this freeway that were completed were a bypass of Ringoes in the 1960s and a freeway between the Delaware River and Ringoes in 1974; the rest was canceled due to opposition from residents along the route. With {{the completion of the}} US202 freeway in Hunterdon County, the former alignment became Route 179. The portion of US202 concurrent with Route 23 in Wayne was upgraded from a four-lane road to a six-lane road in the 1980s.|$|E
