40|$|Ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) {{catalyze}} {{the reduction}} of nucleotides to 2 '-deoxynucleotides in all organisms. Class lb RNRs consist of two subunits: a houses the catalytic and allosteric effector binding sites, and p houses a catalytically essential dimanganic-tyrosyl radical (Mn(III) 2 -Y*). The allosteric regulation of lb RNR activity has only been studied with the Salmonella enterica enzyme, which exhibits substrate specificity allosteric regulation by ATP and 2 '-deoxynucleoside 5 '-triphosphates (dNTPs), but not <b>overall</b> activity <b>regulation</b> by ATP and dATP. However, the S. enterica enzyme {{is not a good}} general model for Ib RNRs because it is not essential under most growth conditions, including pathogenesis. Other bacteria pathogenic to humans utilize lb RNRs as their sole source of dNTPs for DNA replication and repair. As RNR regulation plays a critical role in the high fidelity of these processes, the allosteric regulation of lb RNRs used as the primary dNTP supplier for a bacterium should be distinct from the S. enterica enzyme and, therefore, could provide a potential target for therapeutic development. Herein, the results of characterizing the allosteric regulation of the Ib RNR from the model organism Bacillus subtilis are presented. To facilitate these studies, we identified, cloned, and isolated the physiological reductant for RNR (thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase/NADPH), thus allowing us to monitor activity spectrophotometrically. We discovered the effector dATP was a potent inhibitor of enzymatic activity at physiologically relevant concentrations, thereby demonstrating the first example of <b>overall</b> activity allosteric <b>regulation</b> in a class lb system. In other RNRs, <b>overall</b> activity <b>regulation</b> is mediated by a domain called the ATP-cone. This domain is absent from the B. subtilis enzyme; therefore, the inhibition represents a new mechanism of <b>overall</b> activity <b>regulation.</b> Analytical ultracentrifugation studies suggest dATP inhibition may be mediated by formation of large protein complexes. Biophysical studies also led to the discovery of tightly bound dAMP associated with a that increases the susceptibility of RNR to dATP inhibition. The potential physiological importance of dAMP is supported by studies examining YmaB, the unique fourth member of the B. subtilis RNR operon, which revealed this enzyme can hydrolyze dATP into dAMP and pyrophosphate and, therefore, might insert dAMP into a. by Mackenzie James Parker.

40|$|Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is a {{key enzyme}} in the de novo {{biosynthesis}} and homeostatic maintenance of all four DNA building blocks {{by being able to}} make deoxyribonucleotides from the corresponding ribonucleotides. It is important for the cell to control the production of a balanced supply of the dNTPs to minimize misincorporations in DNA. Because RNR is the rate-limiting enzyme in DNA synthesis, it is an important target for antimicrobial and antiproliferative molecules. The enzyme RNR {{has one of the most}} sophisticated allosteric regulations known in Nature with four allosteric effectors (ATP, dATP, dGTP, and dTTP) and two allosteric sites. One of the sites (s-site) controls the substrate specificity of the enzyme, whereas the other one (a-site) regulates the overall activity.   The a-site binds either dATP, which inhibits the enzyme or ATP that activates the enzyme. In eukaryotes, ATP activation is directly through the a-site and in E. coli it is a cross-talk effect between the a and s-sites. It is important to study and get more knowledge about the <b>overall</b> activity <b>regulation</b> of RNR, both because it has an important physiological function, but also because it may provide important clues to the design of antibacterial and antiproliferative drugs, which can target RNR. Previous studies of class I RNRs, the class found in nearly all eukaryotes and many prokaryotes have revealed that the <b>overall</b> activity <b>regulation</b> is dependent on the formation of oligomeric complexes. The class I RNR consists of two subunits, a large α subunit, and a small β subunit. The oligomeric complexes vary between different species with the mammalian and yeast enzymes cycle between structurally different active and inactive α 6 β 2 complexes, and the E. coli enzyme cycles between active α 2 β 2 and inactive α 4 β 4 complexes. Because RNR equilibrates between many different oligomeric forms that are not resolved by most conventional methods, we have used a technique termed gas-phase electrophoretic macromolecule analysis (GEMMA). In the present studies, our focus is on characterizing both prokaryotic and mammalian class I RNRs. In one of our projects, we have studied the class I RNR from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and found that it represents a novel mechanism of <b>overall</b> activity allosteric <b>regulation,</b> which is different from the two known <b>overall</b> activity allosteric <b>regulation</b> found in E. coli and eukaryotic RNRs, respectively.   The structural differences between the bacterial and the eukaryote class I RNRs are interesting from a drug developmental viewpoint because they open up the possibility of finding inhibitors that selectively target the pathogens. The biochemical data that we have published in the above project was later supported by crystal structure and solution X-ray scattering data that we published together with Derek T. Logan`s research group. We have also studied the effect of a novel antiproliferative molecule, NSC 73735, on the oligomerization of the human RNR large subunit. This collaborative research results showed that the molecule NSC 73735 is the first reported non-nucleoside molecule which alters the oligomerization to inhibit human RNR and the molecule disrupts the cell cycle distribution in human leukemia cells...|$|R
