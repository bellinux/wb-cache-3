Hearings on national health insurance were held in 1971, but no bill {{had the support of}} House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committee chairmen Representative Wilbur Mills and Senator Russell Long. Kennedy sponsored and helped pass the limited Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973.

5|$|Fischbach {{returned}} to the NIH in 1998 when he was named director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), {{a division of the}} NIH that supports research on the brain and nervous system. While he was director, Fischbach oversaw a staff of more than 700 and an annual budget of about $800 million. This money was used to support research by private and public organizations across the country as well as scientists working in labs at NINDS. Fischbach accomplished many things while director of NINDS, one of which being helping to shape national policy on important neurological research issues. He received great praise for his time as director from both Harold Varmus, former director of the NIH and current director <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Cancer</b> Institute (NCI), and Richard Klausner, former director of the NCI. Fischbach left NINDS is 2001 when he was named Columbia University's Vice President for Health and Biomedical Sciences.|$|E

25|$|In the 1980s rapamycin was {{evaluated}} by the Developmental Therapeutic Branch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Cancer</b> Institute (NCI). It was discovered that rapamycin had an anticancer activity and was a non-cytotoxic agent with cytostatic activity against several human cancer types. However, due to unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties, the development of mTOR inhibitors {{for the treatment of}} cancer was not successful at that time. Since then, rapamycin has also shown to be effective for preventing coronary artery re-stenosis and for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.|$|E

Scheele's skilled diplomacy before the United States Congress in the spring of 1947 netted the National Institute of Health (NIH) a fourteenfold increase in budget appropriation. He was elevated to director of NCI and associate director of NIH (1947), the latter a position created for him.|$|E

25|$|Nixon {{submitted}} {{two significant}} medical research initiatives to Congress in February 1971. The first, popularly {{referred to as}} the War on Cancer, resulted in passage that December <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Cancer</b> Act, which injected nearly $1.6 billion (equivalent to $9 billion in 2016) in federal funding to cancer research over a three-year period. It also provided for establishment of medical centers dedicated to clinical research and cancer treatment, 15 of them initially, whose work is coordinated by the National Cancer Institute. The second initiative, focused on Sickle-cell disease (SCD), resulted in passage of the National Sickle Cell Anemia Control Act in May 1972. Long ignored, the lifting of SCD from obscurity to high visibility reflected the changing dynamics of electoral politics and race relations in America during the early 1970s. Under this legislation, the National Institutes of Health established several sickle cell research and treatment centers and the Health Services Administration established sickle cell screening and education clinics around the country.|$|E

500|$|The {{first study}} {{involving}} statistics {{on abortion and}} breast cancer was a broad study in 1957 examining common cancers in Japan. The researchers were cautious about drawing any conclusions from their unreliable methodologies. During the 1960s several studies by Brian MacMahon et al. in Europe and Asia touched on a correlation between abortion and breast cancer. Their 1973 paper published in the Journal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Cancer</b> Institute inaccurately concluded that [...] "where a relationship was observed, abortion was associated with increased, not decreased, risk." [...] Research relevant to the current ABC discussion focuses on more recent large cohort studies, a few meta-analyses, many case-control studies, and several early experiments with rats.|$|E

500|$|Brind's {{paper was}} criticized in the Journal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Cancer</b> Institute for {{ignoring}} {{the role of}} response bias and for a [...] "blurring of association with causation." [...] The amount of attention the study received prompted a cautionary editorial by a JECH editor. With the appearance of larger studies contradicting Brind's finding, Brind failed to convince the scientific community that abortion caused breast cancer. In 2003, Brind was invited to the NCI workshop on abortion and breast cancer, {{where he was the}} only one to formally dissent from the workshop's finding that there is no link between the two. Brind blames the lack of support for his findings on a conspiracy, arguing that the NCI and other major medical organizations are engaged in a [...] "cover-up" [...] for the purpose of [...] "protecting the abortion industry".|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, a 1999 {{review of}} tobacco smoke {{carcinogens}} {{published in the}} Journal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Cancer</b> Institute states that [...] "levels of polonium-210 in tobacco smoke are not believed to be great enough to significantly impact lung cancer in smokers."
