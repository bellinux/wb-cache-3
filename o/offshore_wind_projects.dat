The Haliade 150 turbine was a development of the previous mechanically isolated transmission designs developed by Ecotècnia; the gearbox driven electrically generator was omitted and replaced with a gearless direct drive permanent magnet synchronous generator designed for higher efficiency and greater reliability with fewer moving parts. The turbine uses 73.5m turbine blades from LM Wind Power.|$|E
50|$|Overall, {{wind power}} raises costs of {{electricity}} slightly. In 2015, {{it was estimated}} that the use of wind power in the UK had added £18 to the average yearly electricity bill. This was the additional cost to consumers of using wind to generate about 9.3% of the annual total (see table below) - about £2 for each 1%. Nevertheless, offshore wind power is significantly more expensive than onshore, which raises costs. <b>Offshore</b> <b>wind</b> <b>projects</b> completed in 2012-14 had a levelised cost of electricity of £131/MWh compared to a wholesale price of £40-50/MWh. In 2017 the Financial Times reported that new offshore wind costs had fallen by nearly a third over four years, to an average of £97/MWh, meeting the government's £100/MWh target four years early.|$|E

50|$|The United Kingdom {{became the}} world leader of {{offshore}} wind power generation in October 2008 when it overtook Denmark. It also has the largest offshore wind farm in the world, the 175-turbine London Array wind farm, located off the Kent coast. Currently it has 1,858 MW of operational nameplate capacity, with a further 2,359 MW in construction. The United Kingdom has been estimated to have {{over a third of}} Europe's total offshore wind resource, which is equivalent to three times the electricity needs of the nation at current rates of electricity consumption. (In 2010 peak winter demand was 59.3 GW, in summer it drops to about 45 GW). One estimate calculates that wind turbines in one third of United Kingdom waters shallower than 25 m would, on average, generate 40 GW; turbines in one third of the waters between 25 m and 50 m depth would on average generate a further 80 GW, i.e. 120 GW in total. An estimate of the theoretical maximum potential of the United Kingdom's offshore wind resource in all waters to 700 m depth gives the average power as 2200 GW. <b>Offshore</b> <b>wind</b> <b>projects</b> completed in 2010-11 had a levelised cost of electricity of £136/MWh, which fell to £131/MWh for projects completed in 2012-14 and £121/MWh for projects approved in 2012-14; the industry hopes to get the cost down to £100/MWh for projects approved in 2020.|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} few years the {{offshore}} wind industry thrived leading to an exponential development of offshore wind parks. Traditionally large energy utilities developed <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> <b>projects</b> with merely their own resources in combination with corporate finance. However due to a significant growth of the size of projects and due to changing market conditions external financing sources are increasingly needed to meet the development demand. According to recent literature, institutional investors are able to play an increasing role in the financing and refinancing process of offshore wind parks. This research will focus on the Netherlands. This research will map the variables that influence the decision making of Dutch institutional investors and it shows how their role in Dutch <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> <b>projects</b> can be increased.
