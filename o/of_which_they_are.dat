5|$|Fodor {{revived the}} idea of modularity, without the notion of precise {{physical}} localizability, in the 1980s, {{and became one of}} the most vocal proponents of it with the 1983 publication of his monograph Modularity of Mind. Two properties of modularity in particular, informational encapsulation and domain specificity, make it possible to tie together questions of functional architecture with those of mental content. The ability to elaborate information independently from the background beliefs of individuals that these two properties allow Fodor to give an atomistic and causal account of the notion of mental content. The main idea, in other words, is that the properties of the contents of mental states can depend, rather than exclusively on the internal relations of the system <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> a part, also on their causal relations with the external world.|$|E
5|$|Human Rights Watch, {{in their}} 2008 report on Saudi Arabian {{criminal}} justice system, {{noted that the}} criminal procedure code introduced in 2002 lacked some basic protections but, as mentioned above, had been ignored by judges in any case. Those arrested are often not informed of the crime <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> accused or given access to a lawyer and are subject to abusive treatment and torture {{if they do not}} confess. At trial, there is a presumption of guilt and the accused is often unable to examine witnesses and evidence or present a legal defense. Most trials are held in secret, that is, without the public or press. The physical punishments imposed by Saudi courts, such as beheading, stoning, amputation and lashing, and the number of executions have also been strongly criticized.|$|E

25|$|Lint is {{the common}} name for visible accumulations of textile fibers and other {{materials}}, usually found on and around clothing. Certain materials used {{in the manufacture of}} clothing, such as cotton, linen, and wool, contain numerous, very short fibers bundled together. During the course of normal wear, these fibers may either detach or be jostled out of the weave <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> part. This is the reason that heavily used articles like shirts and towels become thin over time, and why these particles collect in the lint screen of a clothes dryer.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there are}} no {{official}} boundaries to the Allegheny Mountains region, it may be generally defined to the east by the Great Appalachian Valley (locally called the Cumberland Valley in Pennsylvania and the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia); to the north by the Susquehanna River valley; and to the south by the New River valley. To the west, the Alleghenies grade down into the dissected Allegheny Plateau (<b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> sometimes {{considered to be a}} part). The westernmost ridges are considered to be the Laurel and Chestnut Ridges in Pennsylvania and Laurel and Rich Mountains in West Virginia.|$|E
25|$|There are few {{available}} {{options for}} antiandrogen therapy. Spironolactone, cyproterone acetate, and flutamide {{are some of}} the most well-known and widely used drugs. Compared to cyproterone acetate, spironolactone is considerably less potent as an antiandrogen by weight and binding affinity. However, despite this, at the doses <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> typically used, spironolactone and cyproterone acetate have been found to be generally about equivalent in terms of effectiveness for a variety of androgen-related conditions, though, cyproterone acetate has shown a slight though non-statistically-significant advantage in some studies. Also, it has been suggested that cyproterone acetate could be more effective in cases where androgen levels are more pronounced, though this has not been proven.|$|E

25|$|The Socialist Party, however, {{refused to}} condemn the McNamara brothers, arguing that their actions were {{justified}} {{in view of the}} supposed employer- and state-sponsored terror their union had faced for the last 25 years. Haywood and Debs echoed that sentiment. Wrote Debs:It is easy enough for a gentleman of education and refinement to sit at his typewriter and point out the crimes of the workers. But let him be one of them himself, reared in hard poverty, denied education, thrown into the brute struggle for existence from childhood, oppressed, exploited, forced to strike, clubbed by the police, jailed while his family is evicted, and his wife and children are hungry, and he will hesitate {{to condemn the}}se as criminals who fight against the crimes <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> the victims of such savage methods as have been forced upon them by their masters.|$|E
25|$|The City of Liverpool is {{the most}} {{successful}} footballing city in England. Football {{is the most}} popular sport in the city, home to Everton F.C. and Liverpool F.C.. Between them, the clubs have won 27 English First Division titles, 12 FA Cup titles, 10 League Cup titles, 5 European Cup titles, 1 European Cup Winners' Cup title, 3 UEFA Cup titles, and 24 FA Charity Shields. The clubs both compete in the Premier League, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> founding members, and contest the Merseyside Derby, dubbed the 'friendly derby' despite there having been more sending-offs in this fixture than any other. However, unlike many other derbies, it is not rare for families in the city to contain supporters of both clubs. Liverpool F.C. is the English and British club with the most European Cup titles with five, the latest in 2005.|$|E
25|$|Western-based {{organizations}} such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch condemn both the Saudi criminal justice system and its severe punishments. There are no jury trials in Saudi Arabia and courts observe few formalities. Human Rights Watch, in a 2008 report, noted that a criminal procedure code had been introduced {{for the first time}} in 2002, but it lacked some basic protections and, in any case, had been routinely ignored by judges. Those arrested are often not informed of the crime <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> accused or given access to a lawyer and are subject to abusive treatment and torture if they do not confess. At trial, there is a presumption of guilt and the accused is often unable to examine witnesses and evidence or present a legal defense. Most trials are held in secret. An example of sentencing is that UK pensioner and cancer victim Karl Andree, aged 74, faced 360 lashes for home brewing alcohol. He was later released due to intervention by the British government.|$|E
