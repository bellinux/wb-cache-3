40|$|Most modern {{software}} applications have rich {{graphical user interfaces}} (GUIs). In the desk-top environment, these visual interfaces give many users effective access to computing re-sources (Section 1. 1). However, when a user’s visual channel is impaired (Section 1. 2. 1) or preoccupied (Section 1. 2. 2), graphical user interfaces can become difficult or impossible to use. In these situations, audio displays (Section 1. 2. 3) might serve as effective alternatives to their graphical counterparts for common, text-centric computing tasks (Section 1. 2. 4). Current methods of producing audio user interfaces can be classified along two dimen-sions (Section 2). The first measures the level of support an application offers for audio <b>display,</b> <b>and</b> <b>ranges</b> from innate provision (dedication) to reliance on external software (adap-tation) for handling audio output.

To achieve good visibility and eye-catching quality, we must know the optimum number of <b>display</b> colors <b>and</b> <b>ranges</b> of chromaticity so that the road users can correctly recognize displayed information in a short time. We attempted to determine the optimum number of display colors based on the categorical color (basic perceived color) technique, as well as to define the chromaticity regions for display colors so that a given color is most effectively discriminated from the others. The results showed that the optimum number of display colors is ten, and categorization of the so-defined ten display colors on the chromaticity diagram is extremely useful in designing a traffic information board.
