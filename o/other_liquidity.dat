40|$|Employing a {{comprehensive}} database on transactions of corporate bonds issued by corporations, agencies and financial institutions, we compare the different liquidity measures [...] bid-ask spread, zero-return percentage, Amihud illiquidity {{factor for the}} corporate bond market. The criteria of judging {{is based on the}} explanatory power of different liquidity measures in determining yield spread over the benchmark curve (equivalent-maturity Treasury bond or notes). The conclusion is that liquidity plays a role in determining corporate bond yield spread. There are significant differences in the explanatory power of the different liquidity measures; among the liquidity measures, zero-return percentage works best. Preliminary findings, based on the mean correlation analysis and portfolios approach, give the intuitive results of suggesting that zero-return percentage is a better predictor of yields spread than the <b>other</b> <b>liquidity</b> measures [...] bid-ask spread and Amihud illiquidity factor. Controlling the effect of credit rating, the zero-return percentage increases R-square dramatically, with incremental R-square of 7 %. Model specification test shows that the model with zero-return percentage as liquidity measures gives the smallest BIC whatever form the models are. We also compare the zero-return percentage with trading-based liquidity measure.

50|$|The {{amount of}} {{liquidity}} held by banks on their accounts {{can be a}} lot less (and usually is) than the total value of transferred payments during a day. The total amount of liquidity needed by banks to settle a given set of payments is dependent on the balancedness of the circulation of money from account to account (reciprocity of payments), the timing of payments and the netting procedures used. The inability of some participants to send payments can cause severe falls in settlement ratios of payments. The failure of one participant to send payments can have negative contagion effects on <b>other</b> participants' <b>liquidity</b> positions and their potential to send payments.|$|R
40|$|Many exchanges {{operating}} {{an electronic}} open limit order book employ designated market makers to improve liquidity, particularly for less liquid stocks. Previous {{research has shown}} that the existence of a market maker improves liquidity, and that the share price reacts favorably to the announcement that a firm hires a market maker. Little is known, however, about what market makers actually do. We try to fill this gap. Using a data set covering 110 German stocks we analyze the trading activity of market makers in detail. Their participation rates as a function of firm size (or, alternatively, trading volume) display a u-shaped pattern. They are highest for the smallest firms, then decreases in firm size but increases again for the largest size quintile. Market makers not only provide liquidity but also take <b>liquidity.</b> <b>Other</b> traders take <b>liquidity</b> supplied by market makers particularly in times of high volatility, high bid-ask spreads and high informational asymmetries. Finally, we demonstrate that market makers do, on average, not earn profits. ...|$|R

This paper examines whether PIN is priced because of information asymmetry or because of <b>other</b> <b>liquidity</b> effects that are unrelated to information asymmetry. Our starting point is a model that decomposes PIN into two components, one related to asymmetric information and one related to illiquidity. In a two-pass Fama-MacBeth [1973. Risk, return, and equilibrium: empirical tests. Journal of Political Economy 81, 607 - 636] regression, we show that the PIN component related to asymmetric information is not priced, while the PIN component related to illiquidity is priced. We conclude, therefore, that liquidity effects unrelated to information asymmetry explain the relation between PIN and the cross-section of expected returns. Liquidity Information asymmetry...|$|E

The price impact coefficients are highly correlated with bid-ask spreads and with episodes of reported poor liquidity (such as the fall 1998 financial markets turmoil).

40|$|Many small {{over-the-counter}} (OTC) {{markets with}} thinly-traded assets {{are prone to}} episodic volatility and market failure due to their high potential for predatory activity.

Cooperation fails with extremely large liquidity events, which leads to occasional episodic volatility.

We find that at the market-level, volatility is a key factor determining the limit order book’s liquidity provision. When market volatility increases, the book becomes more disperse and the liquidity provided by the limit order book decreases. Past market movements, especially market declines, exert significant impact on the limit order book as well. Our limit order book measures possess significant explanatory and predictive power on <b>other</b> <b>liquidity</b> measures such as bid-ask spread or Amihud illiquidity.

40|$|Using a {{comprehensive}} set of liquidity measures, {{this study examines}} {{the impact of the}} NYSE Hybrid Market on various stock characteristics. In addition, we test the conjecture that trade automation results in more pronounced liquidity improvements for small stocks. The resulting change in the relationship between size and liquidity is also examined, as well as the change in the explanatory power of the SMB factor. We find evidence that the general state of liquidity improved subsequent to migration to Hybrid. However, results for the size-conditioned test are mixed and inconsistent across liquidity measures. While liquidity improvements in terms of amortized spreads are concentrated in small stocks, the pattern is less obvious when <b>other</b> <b>liquidity</b> measures are considered. Also, while the test involves a NYSE event, changes also exist in NASDAQ, probably due to a competitive spill-over effect. We find that the relationship between size and liquidity characteristics has changed post-Hybrid, particularly on NYSE, and that the SMB factor has less effect on asset pricing when the entire CRSP sample is tested but not for the NYSE and NASDAQ subsamples individually. Nevertheless, firm size seems {{to play an important role}} in differentiating the impact of changes in market design...|$|E
40|$|Basel III banking {{regulation}} {{emphasizes the}} use of liquidity coverage and nett stable funding ratios as measures of liquidity risk. In this paper, we approximate these measures by using global liquidity data for 391 hand-selected, LIBOR-based, Basel II compliant banks in 36 countries for the period 2002 to 2012. In particular, we compare the risk sensitivity of the aforementioned Basel III liquidity risk measures to those of traditional measures such as the nonperforming assets ratio, return-on-assets, LIBOR-OISS, Basel II Tier 1 capital ratio, government securities ratio, and brokered deposits ratio. Furthermore, we use a discrete-time hazard model to study bank failure. In this regard, we find that Basel III risk measures have limited ability to predict bank failure when compared with their traditional counterparts. An important result is that a higher liquidity coverage ratio {{is associated with a}} higher bank failure rate. We also find that market-wide liquidity risk (proxied by LIBOR-OISS) was the major predictor of bank failures in 2009 and 2010 while idiosyncratic liquidity risk (proxied by <b>other</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk measures) was less. In particular, our contribution is the first to achieve these results on a global scale over a relatively long period for a variety of banks...|$|E
