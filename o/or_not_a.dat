5|$|A deeper analogy relates tidal {{forces with}} a {{property}} of surfaces called curvature. For gravitational fields, the absence or presence of tidal forces determines {{whether or not}} the influence of gravity can be eliminated by choosing a freely falling reference frame. Similarly, the absence or presence of curvature determines whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> surface is equivalent to a plane. In the summer of 1912, inspired by these analogies, Einstein searched for a geometric formulation of gravity.|$|E
5|$|According to Paine {{scholars}} Edward Davidson and William Scheick, {{he probably}} {{wrote the first}} draft of Part I in late 1793, but Paine biographer David Hawke argues for a date of early 1793. It is also unclear whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> French edition of Part I was published in 1793. François Lanthenas, who translated The Age of Reason into French in 1794, wrote that it was first published in France in 1793, but no book fitting his description has been positively identified. Barlow published the first English edition of The Age of Reason, Part I in 1794 in London, selling it for a mere three pence.|$|E
5|$|After {{the split}} with the Bahá'ís, some Azalis were {{very active in}} secular reform {{movements}} and the Iranian Constitutional Revolution (19051907), including Shaykh Ahmad Ruhi Kermani and Mirza Abd-al-Hosayn Kermani. However, the community was still suppressed as a heresy and the accusation of being an Azali was often enough for most to {{believe it to be}} true. Coupled with the Azali practice of taqiyya (dissimulation) determining whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> particular figure in Persian politics was an Azali is difficult.|$|E

The sponge can be inserted up to 24hours before intercourse and must be left in place for at least six hours afterward. Allergic reactions and more severe adverse effects such as toxic shock syndrome have been reported.|$|E
5|$|For many years, the {{classification}} of Herrerasaurus was unclear because it was known from very fragmentary remains. It was hypothesized to be a basal theropod, a basal sauropodomorph, a basal saurischian, <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> dinosaur at all but another type of archosaur. However, {{with the discovery of}} an almost complete skeleton and skull in 1988, Herrerasaurus has been classified as either an early theropod or an early saurischian in at least five recent reviews of theropod evolution, with many researchers treating it at least tentatively as the most primitive member of Theropoda.|$|E
5|$|In February 1998, Archie Comics adapted Nights into Dreams into a three-issue {{comic book}} miniseries {{to test whether}} <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> Nights comic would sell well in North America. The first miniseries was loosely based on the game, with Nights being {{specifically}} identified as a male despite the character's androgynous design. The company later released a second three-issue miniseries, continuing {{the story of the}} first, but the series did not gain enough sales to warrant an ongoing series. The series would later be added to a list of guest franchises featured in Archie Comics' Worlds Unite crossover between its Sonic the Hedgehog and Mega Man titles.|$|E

5|$|Jack jumper ants are {{primarily}} active {{during the day}} and live in open habitats, nesting in bushland, woodland and dry open forests, surrounded by gravel and sandy soil, which can be found in rural areas and are less common in urban areas. They prey on small insects and use their barbless stinger to kill other insects by injecting venom. Other ants and predatory invertebrates prey on the jack jumper. The average worker has a life expectancy of over one year. Workers are gamergates, allowing them to reproduce with drones, whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> queen is present in the colony. The ant {{is a part of the}} Myrmecia pilosula species complex; this ant and other members of the complex are known to have a single pair of chromosomes.|$|E

However, trials to test agents that could halt these cellular mechanisms have met largely with failure. For example, interest existed in cooling the injured brain; however, a 2014 Cochrane review did not find enough evidence to see if it was useful <b>or</b> <b>not.</b> <b>A</b> 2016 review found that maintaining a normal or low normal temperature appeared useful in adults but not children. High quality evidence to support targeted temperature management below normal however is poor.|$|E
5|$|The {{leadership}} of the ACLU does not always agree on policy decisions; differences of opinion within the ACLU leadership have sometimes grown into major debates. In 1937, an internal debate erupted over whether to defend Henry Ford's right to distribute anti-union literature. In 1939, a heated debate took place over whether to prohibit communists from serving in ACLU leadership roles. During the early 1950s and Cold War McCarthyism, the board was divided on whether to defend communists. In 1968, a schism formed over whether to represent Dr. Benjamin Spock's anti-war activism. In 1973, there was internal conflict over whether to call for the impeachment of Richard Nixon. In 2005, there was internal conflict about whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> gag rule should be imposed on ACLU employees to prevent publication of internal disputes.|$|E

Knowing the cloud type at various locations can help determine whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> weather front has passed by a particular location. A low deck of stratus could indicate a station is still north of a warm front, while thunderstorms can indicate the approach of a squall line or cold front.|$|E
5|$|The {{system was}} {{the topic of}} intense inter-service rivalry {{throughout}} its lifetime. When the ABM role {{was given to the}} Army in 1958, the United States Air Force began a long series of critiques on Zeus, both within defense circles and in the press. The Army returned these attacks in kind, taking out full page advertisements in popular mass market news magazines to promote Zeus, as well as spreading development contracts across many states in order to garner the maximum political support. As deployment neared in the early 1960s, the debate became a major political issue. The question ultimately became whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> system with limited effectiveness would be better than nothing at all.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s, a {{political}} debate started concerning whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> new main airport should be built for Oslo and Eastern Norway. A government report launched in 1970, suggested surveys for five locations: Gardermoen, Hurum, Askim, Nesodden and Ås. Hobøl was preliminarily selected and areas reserved {{for a future}} airport. During the 1970s, the Labour Party became concerned that Hobøl was located too centrally {{in relation to the}} growth areas around Oslo, and instead wanted to use Gardermoen, in an attempt to force the population growth further north. Commercial interests and the airlines supported Hobøl. In 1983, Parliament decided to abandon the plans for Hobøl and continue with a divided solution. Fornebu would be expanded, and all charter traffic be moved to Gardermoen. From 1988, all international traffic would also be moved, making Fornebu a purely domestic airport.|$|E

5|$|The {{applicant}} for {{an election}} {{to be avoided}} may ask for a declaration that the election is void, that a particular candidate was wrongfully declared to have been elected, and/or that another candidate was duly elected. The applicant may also request for a scrutiny– that is, a re-examination of the ballot papers– {{if he or she}} alleges that an unsuccessful candidate had a majority of lawful votes. When a scrutiny is conducted, the election judge may order a vote to be struck off if the voter was not on the register of electors assigned to the polling station at which the vote was recorded or was not authorized to vote at the station; if the vote was obtained by bribery, treating or undue influence; if the voter committed or induced someone to commit the offence of personation; and if the vote was for a disqualified candidate and the disqualification was either a matter that the voter was aware of or was sufficiently publicized or widely known. During a scrutiny, a tendered vote that is shown to be valid will be added to the poll if any party to the proceedings asks for the vote to be added. On the other hand, a registered elector's vote will not be struck off at a scrutiny just because he or she was not qualified to be on the electoral register, and the returning officer's decision as to whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> ballot paper should be rejected may not be questioned.|$|E
