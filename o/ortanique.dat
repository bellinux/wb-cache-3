The irish potato was first introduced to Jamaica at Bethany, a town in the parish. Citrus also became an important crop, as in 1920, the citrus fruit <b>ortanique,</b> a cross between the orange and tangerine, was developed by Charles Jackson.|$|E
40|$|The Murcott tangor {{represent}} 20 % of the tangerines {{trees in}} São Paulo State being the second more grown. Their fruits have good acceptance {{in the market}} cause of the good characteristics presented as: size, attractive internal and external color, transport resistance, high juice rate and industry potential. It is necessary to study the behavior of others varieties, in order to amplify the diversity of tangerine industry, which show suitable characteristics to the fresh fruit market and that make possible different harvest season. Many tangerine varieties, selected from the Citrus Germplasm Bank of the do Centro Avançado de Pesquisa Tecnológica do Agronegócio de Citros "Sylvio Moreira"/IAC, belong to trials carried out in 15 places in São Paulo State. The Capão Bonito area, south-west of the state, is one of this places where the Nova tangelo, the <b>Ortanique</b> and the Murcott tangors are showing quite good results about their fruit qualities. This paper had as an objective to compare the fruit characteristics of the Nova tangelo, the Murcott and the <b>Ortanique</b> tangors grafted on two rootstocks: Rangpur lime and Cleopatra mandarin. Accordingly to the gotten results, is possible to conclude that Nova and <b>Ortanique</b> had shown weight, width, fruit shape and juice percent, similar to the Murcott. In compliance with the harvest season, the Nova present suitable conditions to fresh fruit market in May and June. By the other hand the Murcott fruits can be harvested in July to August and the <b>Ortanique</b> in August to September. For this reason, is possible extend the harvest season of this mandarin-like, from two to five month, occurring inclusive in a period out of the crop at the north hemisphere...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to assess the}} genetic similarity of the following citrus fresh fruit market seedless cultivars: Lane Late, Navelate, Navelina and Salustiana sweet oranges (Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck), Clemenules and Marisol mandarins (C. reticulata Blanco) and Okitsu satsuma mandarin (C. unshiu Marcovitch), and the hybrids Nova [C. clementina x (C. paradisi x C. tangerina) ] and <b>Ortanique</b> (tangor probably derived from C. sinensis (L.) Osbeck x C. reticulata Blanco), utilizing isoenzymatic markers. Electrophoresis analysis of proteins extracted from leaf tissues was utilized to detect polymorphisms at ten isoenzymatic systems. Out of 30 alleles, 16 were polymorphic. The Jaccard coefficient was utilized to estimate the genetic similarity between the cultivars and the unweigthed pair-group method using an arithmetic average (UPGMA) was used to obtain the phenogram (NTSYS 1. 7). The cultivars showed high genetic similarity (> 72. 5 %), and were classified in five main groups: sweet oranges, 'Clemenules' and 'Marisol' mandarins, 'Nova', 'Ortanique', and 'Okitsu' satsuma mandarin. O objetivo deste trabalho foi estudar a similaridade genética das seguintes cultivares sem sementes de citros de mesa: laranjas Lane Late, Navelate, Navelina e Salustiana (Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck), tangerinas Clemenules e Marisol (C. reticulata Blanco), satsuma Okitsu (C. unshiu Marcovitch) e híbridos Nova [C. clementina x (C. paradisi x C. tangerina) ] e <b>Ortanique</b> (tangor provavelmente entre C. sinensis (L.) Osbeck e C. reticulata Blanco), por intermédio de marcadores isoenzimáticos. O polimorfismo foi detectado por eletroforese de proteínas extraídas de tecido foliar em 10 sistemas isoenzimáticos. Foram obtidos 30 alelos, sendo 16 polimórficos. O coeficiente de Jaccard foi utilizado para estimar a similaridade genética entre as cultivares e o método UPGMA para gerar o fenograma por meio do NTSYS 1, 7. As cultivares apresentaram elevada similaridade genética (> 72, 5 %) e cinco grupos principais foram detectados: laranjas-doces, tangerinas 'Clemenules' e 'Marisol', 'Nova', 'Ortanique', e satsuma 'Okitsu'...|$|E

40|$|The primary aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of <b>ortanique</b> peel polymethoxylated flavones extract (PMFort) on antioxidant enzymes activities and lipid peroxide levels in organs of hypercholesterolemic and normal rats. Thirty Sprague-Dawley rats were fed high cholesterol diets supplemented with 1. 5 % PMFort and niacin respectively for 49 days. Hypercholesterolemic rats fed PMFort had significant reductions in malondialdehyde levels in the liver and brain compared to untreated hypercholesterolemic control rats. This reduction also occurred in the brain of the rats fed niacin. The activities of catalase, glutathione reductase, transferase and peroxidase were significantly reduced in the spleen, brain and liver of hypercholesterolemic rats fed PMFort compared to control. The activities of these enzymes were only reduced in the brain and liver of rats fed niacin. The results would suggest that PMFort modulates hypercholesterolemia-associated organ injury and oxidative stress in rat organs. PMFort could therefore be a suitable candidate of natural origin for prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of hypercholesterolemia-associated oxidative stress and organ injury...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Caused by Alternaria alternata, Alternaria {{brown spot}} (ABS) {{is a major}} fungal disease of {{mandarins}} in Brazil, causing serious losses in commercial orchards of Ponkan tangerine (Citrus reticulata Blanco) and Murcott tangor [C. sinensis (L.) Osbeck × C. reticulata Blanco]. The response of 31 accessions/genotypes of mandarins and their hybrids to A. alternata, was evaluated in São Paulo state, Brazil. The incidence and severity of the disease in fruit were evalu-ated in the field, using diagrammatic scale, four times during 2008 and 2009. Based on these data, the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) was calculated. In parallel, in vivo and in vitro inoculations with A. alternata were made on leaves to confirm field results. Resistance and susceptibility was evaluated in controlled experiments by {{counting the number of}} lesions per leaf using a diagrammatic scale. Most of the genotypes were symptomatic after inocula-tion with A. alternata with disease most severe on the hybrids Nova, África do Sul, Ponkan and Murcott. Cultivars like Cravo, Nules and <b>Ortanique</b> that have excellent fruit quality and had lower AUDPCs, whereas Fremont and Thomas were highly resistant to the fungus and did not show any symptoms in the field or in controlled inoculations. The attractiveness and pronounced flavor of Fremont and Thomas fruit make them new options for the citriculture...|$|E
