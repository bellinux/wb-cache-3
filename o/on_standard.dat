Loading and unloading of passengers was accomplished via wide doors positioned on each side {{at the center of the}} cars with built-in trap doors and steps. Light and ventilation was provided by ten window units mounted on each side, each equipped with rolling black out shades and wire mesh screens.|$|E

5|$|Captain America: The First Avenger was {{released}} on Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D and DVD on October 25, 2011. The three-disc set includes the film on Blu-ray in high-definition 3D and in high definition 2D, as well as <b>on</b> <b>standard</b> definition DVD with a digital copy. The two-disc Blu-ray/DVD combo pack includes a high-definition presentation of the film and a standard-definition presentation with a digital copy. Both sets include over an hour of bonus material, including the short film A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer, a sneak peek of The Avengers, six behind-the-scenes featurettes, and deleted scenes with commentary by director Joe Johnston, director of photography Shelly Johnson and editor Jeff Ford. In its first week of release, Captain America: The First Avenger topped the Blu-ray and DVD sales charts, selling 1.54 million Blu-ray units and 726,000 DVD units and making a combined total of $52.6 million.|$|E

5|$|Each {{film was}} {{released}} <b>on</b> <b>standard</b> two-disc edition DVDs containing previews {{of the next}} film. The success of the theatrical cuts brought about four-disc Extended Editions, with new editing, added special effects and music. The extended cuts of the films and the included special features were spread over two discs, and a limited collector's edition was also released. The Fellowship of the Ring was released on 12 November 2002, containing 30minutes more footage, an Alan Lee painting of the Fellowship entering Moria, and the Moria Gate {{on the back of}} the sleeve; an Argonath-styled bookend was included with the Collector's Edition. The Two Towers, released on 18 November 2003, contained 44minutes extra footage and a Lee painting of Gandalf the White's entrance; the Collector's Edition contained a Sméagol statue, with a crueller-looking statue of his Gollum persona available by order for a limited time.|$|E
5|$|In 1949 the Railway Executive decided <b>on</b> <b>standard</b> {{types of}} signs {{to be used}} at all stations. Lettering was to use the Gill Sans {{typeface}} on a background of the regional colour. Gill Sans was also used in much of its printed output, very often in capitals-only settings for signage. Specially drawn variations were developed by the Railway Executive (part of the British Transport Commission) for signs in its manual {{for the use of}} signpainters painting large signs by hand. Other users included Penguin Books' iconic paperback jacket designs from 1935 and British official mapping agency Ordnance Survey. It was also used by London Transport for documents which could not be practically set in Johnston. Paul Shaw, a historian of printing, has described it as a key element of the 'Modernist classical' style from the 1930s to the 1950s, that promoted clean, spare design, often with all-capitals and centred setting of headings.|$|E
5|$|It {{had been}} {{decided that the}} Bergen Line, unlike the Voss Line, was to be built with {{standard}} gauge. So the newly laid line from Bergen to Voss had to be converted {{in time for the}} opening of the Bergen Line. This was especially challenging because of the continuous traffic on the line, with 36 departures per day to Nesttun, six to Garnes and four to Voss. In preparation a few curves had to be straightened, the tunnels widened and the bridges strengthened. On the night of 10/11 August 1904 all the track was changed and in the morning the trains could operate <b>on</b> <b>standard</b> gauge to Voss.|$|E

5|$|Opened in 2010, Green Line (Line 5) is {{the fifth}} line of the Delhi Metro network and the first line <b>on</b> <b>standard</b> gauge, as opposed to {{previous}} broad gauge lines. It runs between Inderlok (station on the Red Line) and Mundka with a branch line connecting the line's Ashok Park Main station with Kirti Nagar station on the Blue Line. The completely elevated line, built {{as part of the}} Phase-II of Delhi Metro runs mostly along the busy NH 10 route in West Delhi. The line consists of 17 stations including an interchange station covering a total length of 18.46km. This line also has the country's first standard-gauge maintenance depot at Mundka.|$|E
5|$|The {{project began}} with two aims: {{to prove the}} {{practicality}} of the Williams tube, an early form of computer memory based <b>on</b> <b>standard</b> cathode ray tubes (CRTs); and to construct a machine {{that could be used}} to investigate how computers might be able to assist in the solution of mathematical problems. The first of the series, the Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM), ran its first program on 21 June 1948. As the world's first stored-program computer, the SSEM, and the Manchester Mark 1 developed from it, quickly attracted the attention of the United Kingdom government, who contracted the electrical engineering firm of Ferranti to produce a commercial version. The resulting machine, the Ferranti Mark 1, was the world's first commercially available general-purpose computer.|$|E
5|$|Under the synthesis, debates {{have become}} less ideological and more methodological. Business cycle modelers {{can be broken}} into two camps: those in favor of {{calibration}} and those in favor of estimation. When models are calibrated, the modeler selects parameter values based on other studies or casual empirical observation. Instead of using statistical diagnostics to evaluate models, the model's operating characteristics determine {{the quality of the}} model. Kydland and Prescott (1982) offered no formal evaluation of their model, but noted how variables like hours worked did not match real data well while the variances of other elements of the model did. When estimation methods are used, models are evaluated based <b>on</b> <b>standard</b> statistical goodness of fit criteria. Calibration is generally associated with real business cycle modelers of the new classical school, but methodological differences cut across ideology. While Lucas, Prescott, and Kydland are calibration advocates, another prominent new classical, Sargent, favors estimation.|$|E

5|$|With {{the end of}} summer, Hitler {{redirected}} {{his attention}} to Moscow and assigned Army Group Center to this task. The forces committed to Operation Typhoon included three infantry armies (the 2nd, 4th and 9th) supported by three Panzer (tank) Groups (the 2nd, 3rd and 4th) and by the Luftwaffes Luftflotte 2. Up to two million German troops were committed to the operation, along with 1,000 tanks and 14,000 guns. German aerial strength, however, had been severely reduced over the summer's campaign; the Luftwaffe had lost 1,603 aircraft destroyed and 1,028 damaged. Luftflotte 2 had only 549 serviceable machines, including 158 medium and dive-bombers and 172 fighters, available for Operation Typhoon. The attack relied <b>on</b> <b>standard</b> blitzkrieg tactics, using Panzer groups rushing deep into Soviet formations and executing double-pincer movements, pocketing Red Army divisions and destroying them.|$|E
