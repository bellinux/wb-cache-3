5|$|A {{drawback}} to {{the device was}} found on 7 March 1948, when the firebox crown sheet of Princess Alexandra, a Coronation Pacific of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, failed while hauling a passenger train from Glasgow to London. Enquiries established that both water gauges were defective and on a journey earlier that day <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fusible plugs had melted, but this had gone unnoticed by the engine crew because of the strong draught carrying the escaping steam away from them.|$|E
5|$|As he {{attempted}} to withdraw with the wounded soldier, Bleak was confronted by two more Chinese. Putting down the wounded soldier, Bleak reportedly surprised the Chinese soldiers by charging them and smashing their heads together {{with such force that}} he may have fractured the skulls of <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> assailants before pushing them out of his way. Eventually, all 20 men of the patrol returned to the UN lines, but a third of them were wounded. Bleak was credited with saving the patrol, both by promptly treating the wounded and by aggressively attacking and killing or neutralizing five Chinese soldiers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the evening}} of 9 July 1917, Vanguards {{magazines}} exploded and she sank almost instantly, with only three survivors, one of whom died soon afterwards; 842 men aboard were lost. Collingwoods crew recovered the bodies of three men killed in the explosion. The Board of Inquiry concluded that a fire of unknown origin began in a 4-inch magazine and spread to <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nearby 12-inch magazines, which detonated and sank the ship.|$|E

5|$|The {{line was}} built by the mining company Sydvaranger, who started {{construction}} in 1907 and inaugurated the railway in 1910. From 1912, the port network received electrification, as did the mainline in 1920. Originally, free passenger trains services were also offered. During the Second World War, the line was largely destroyed, but rebuilt afterwards and re-opened in 1952. Electric traction was abandoned in 1955 when two EMD G12 diesel locomotives were bought. The line closed in 1997, but was reopened in 2009, following a change in ownership of the mine. There are proposals to connect the line to either <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Finnish and Russian railway networks.|$|E

In addition, the teams have twice met in the last regular-season series of a season to decide the league title, in 1904 (when the Red Sox won) and 1949 (when the Yankees won).|$|E
5|$|Officially ordered on 2 November 1911 {{and laid}} down {{less than a}} month later on 27 November, the first {{dreadnought}} became the largest ship that Armstrong had built. The second dreadnought was ordered on 29 July 1912 and laid down on 22 January 1913, delayed by Rio de Janeiro occupying the slipway in which it would be built. The New York Tribune (2 November 1913) and Proceedings (May and June 1914) reported that Greece had reached an accord to purchase the first battleship counterbalance the Ottoman Empire's acquisition of Rio de Janeiro from Brazil, but despite a developing sentiment within Chile to sell <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dreadnoughts, no deal was made.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} end of World War I, the number of 50-caliber 76mm guns was reduced to 13, all mounted on the turret tops, and six new 40-caliber 76-millimeter {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) guns were installed abreast the aft funnel. In addition two license-built 2-pounder AA guns were mounted on the forecastle deck abreast 'B' turret. In 1925–26 the foremast was replaced by a tetrapodal mast, which was moved forward of the funnels, the rangefinders were upgraded, and the ships were equipped to handle a Macchi M.18 seaplane mounted on the center turret. Around that same time, <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ships was equipped with a fixed aircraft catapult on the port side of the forecastle.|$|E
5|$|The New-York Tribune {{reported}} in late April that the Argentine government rejected a $17.5million offer for Moreno alone, {{which would have}} netted them a large profit over the original construction cost of the ships ($12million). The United States, worried that its neutrality would not be respected and its technology would be released for study to a foreign country, put diplomatic pressure on the Argentine government to keep the ships, which it eventually did. Similarly, news outlets {{reported in}} late 1913 and early 1914 that Greece had reached an accord to purchase Chile's first battleship as a counterbalance to the Ottoman acquisition of Rio de Janeiro, but despite a developing sentiment within Chile to sell <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dreadnoughts, no deal was made.|$|E
5|$|The ant {{who lost}} the ritual fight will lower its body, and lean {{sideways}} from the victorious ant. The victorious ant will remain raised upward and reach {{down to the}} worker and open its mandibles wider, grasping on the opponent's mandibles, and then tug and shake its head slightly for a few moments. However, the fight may continue if neither worker backs down, and will commence a side to side posture. Both ants circle each other and present their gasters directed to their opponent, and on some occasions, either <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ants would kick outward using their legs at each other. Eventually, they will break contact and groom once appeasement has been reached and continue to search for another ant.|$|E

5|$|After {{the team}} split, Nitro, {{alongside}} Melina, was quickly placed into the Intercontinental Championship picture, winning the title twice. In November, after serving his suspension {{and a brief}} stint back in OVW, Mercury returned to WWE, reuniting MNM to answer an open challenge put out by The Hardys (Matt and Jeff) for the December to Dismember pay-per-view. At the event, MNM lost to the Hardys. MNM and the Hardys met again at Armageddon {{as part of a}} four-way ladder match, which also included the teams of Dave Taylor and William Regal and Paul London and Brian Kendrick. During the match, which saw London and Kendrick retain the WWE Tag Team Championship, Mercury was legitimately injured when he was struck in the face with a ladder, necessitating a trip to the emergency room where his broken nose received 15 stitches. The facial injury was worked into the angle, and when Mercury returned wearing a protective covering on his face, the rivalry between the teams intensified with MNM actively seeking to injure <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hardys, even {{going so far as to}} attack and perform a Snapshot on Matt on exposed concrete following a match. MNM lost to The Hardys at the Royal Rumble, and again at the No Way Out pay-per-view in February, which concluded the feud.|$|E
5|$|The Delhi Durbar Tiara {{was made}} by Garrard & Co. for Queen Mary, the wife of George V, to wear at the Delhi Durbar in 1911. As British law {{prohibited}} {{the removal of the}} Crown Jewels from the country, George V wore a specially made crown (the Imperial Crown of India) to the Durbar, and his consort Queen Mary wore the tiara. It was part of a set of jewellery made for Queen Mary to use at the event which included a necklace, stomacher, brooch and earrings. Made of gold and platinum, the tiara is 8cm (3in) tall and has the form of a tall circlet of lyres and S-scrolls linked by festoons of diamonds. It was originally set with 10 of the Cambridge emeralds, acquired by Queen Mary in 1910 and first owned by her grandmother, the Duchess of Cambridge. In 1912, the tiara was altered to take <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cullinan III and IV diamonds; the pear-shaped diamond was held at the top, and the cushion-shaped stone hung in the oval aperture underneath. Mary lent the tiara to Queen Elizabeth (later the Queen Mother) for the 1947 royal tour of South Africa, and it remained with her until she died in 2002, when it passed to Queen Elizabeth II. In 2005, the Queen lent the tiara to her daughter-in-law, the Duchess of Cornwall.|$|E
