The series first aired in 2000, and nineteen seasons have been completed as of September 2017. Big Brother contestants are chosen by the show's producers through an application process that includes a videotape submission, semi-final interviews at select cities, and a final interview in Los Angeles.

5|$|Filming {{began on}} October 4, 2004 and {{continued}} until October 12. Despite the desert locations, all filming {{took place on}} soundstages. These represented a variety of places throughout the Vulcan desert-like Forge. The remaining sets used were either standing sets, or those which had been constructed for the previous two episodes. The exceptions to that were two sets to represent scenes on board Commander Shran's Andorian vessel. The Andorian bridge set, which had been used previously in the series, had a single wall brought out of storage in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> as a backdrop for Shran when he appears on the Enterprise viewscreen. The Andorian brig was built specifically for this episode for scenes with Shran and Soval.|$|E

25|$|By {{the late}} Ming Dynasty, they often needed to solicit funds from {{powerful}} merchants {{to build new}} roads, schools, bridges, pagodas, or engage in essential industries, such as book-making, which aided the gentry class in education for the imperial examinations. Merchants began to imitate the highly cultivated nature and manners of scholar-officials in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> more cultured and gain higher prestige and acceptance by the scholarly elite. They even purchased printed books that served as guides to proper conduct and behavior and which promoted merchant morality and business ethics.|$|E
25|$|Director of {{photography}} was Ulf Brantås, who {{started his career}} as a cinematographer for Roy Andersson and had filmed both of Moodysson's previous feature films. Lilya 4-ever was shot with an Aaton XTR Prod on 16mm film which was later transferred to 35mm. Minimum lighting was used, mainly from practicals and whenever possible only sunlight. Locations were only sparsely rigged by the crew. A custom built rickshaw, made from the wheels of a mountain bike, was used for the long rearward-facing tracking shots.

As he enlisted while in England, his initial military training was in Salisbury, where the British section of the NZEF was based. In December 1914, he joined up with the main body of the NZEF in Egypt. To his disappointment, as he had hoped to serve in the infantry, Moore-Jones was posted to the New Zealand Engineers, with the rank of sapper (equivalent to private).|$|E

The group consisted of a 4-piece line-up of Miles Ratledge - drums, Bullen - vocals, bass and guitar, Graham Robertson - guitar and bass, and Damien Errington - guitar. After this concert, Miles Ratledge and Bullen asked Broadrick to join Napalm Death as guitarist, with Bullen as vocalist and bass player. The band began to develop a musical style which blended elements of post-punk (particularly Killing Joke and Amebix), heavy hardcore punk in the vein of Discharge, and thrash metal (with particular reference to Possessed and black metal group Celtic Frost).|$|E
25|$|Though she {{had always}} voted Republican in presidential {{elections}} and taken conservative Republican policy positions, McCaughey suddenly switched her party affiliation to Democrat and soon announced plans {{to run for governor}} against Pataki. McCaughey was the early frontrunner for her new party's nomination process, in part because of her statewide name and face recognition and {{in part because of the}} financial support of her wealthy then-husband. During her campaign for governor, she was criticized for firing a succession of campaign aides and political advisers and possibly changing her core political beliefs in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> more electable to New York voters. As her opinion poll numbers sank, her husband took away more than half of the funds he had pledged to her campaign.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, the fee was {{increased}} to S$5, but in 1989 it was reduced back to S$3, {{due to the}} fact that now more vehicles were paying. In 1994, two levels of licence fees were established, to differentiate between daily permits and inter-peak licences. The paper licences vary in shape depending on the class of vehicle, and their colours varied from one month to another to deter fraud. The colour-coded licences also made it easier for the enforcement personnel to identify the vehicles during the restricted hours. For reason of traffic management, violating vehicles were not stopped at the gantries, but their number plates were taken down and their owner would receive an <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> in court to pay the fine. The control was made only at the gantries, therefore, vehicles were free to move around or leave the RZ without having to pay the fee.|$|E

25|$|In 2013, the Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) {{confirmed}} that an internal review showed the corporation had falsified records involving about 4,800 employee hours {{over a period}} of seven months, at its Idaho State Correctional Center. In 2014 a subsequent KPMG audit showed the actual overbilling was for over 26,000 hours. Otter ordered Idaho State Police to investigate to see if criminal charges should be brought. Otter had received a total of $20,000 in campaign contributions from employees of the company since 2003. In March, the state announced that the FBI was taking over the investigation, as well as investigating CCA operations in other states. In January 2014, Otter announced that the state would take back the operations of the prison. In May 2016, CCA, which had by then changed its name to CoreCivic, was found in contempt of court for having failed to comply with a court order regarding the Idaho State Correctional Institution. In an apparent attempt to increase profits, the company had been assigning too few staff to the prison and it submitted false staffing reports in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> to be in compliance.|$|E
25|$|In 1686, James {{tried to}} convert Rochester to Catholicism and every {{audience}} Rochester {{had with the}} king was spent in arguments over {{the authority of the}} Church and the worship of images. Rochester had interviews with Catholic divines in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> open-minded but he refused to convert. The king agreed to a conference between Catholic and Protestant divines in a formal disputation. James allowed Rochester to choose any Anglican ministers except John Tillotson and Edward Stillingfleet. Rochester chose two chaplains who happened to be in waiting, Simon Patrick and William Jane. The conference was held in secret on 30 November at Whitehall and the divines discussed the real presence, with the Catholics taking on the burden of proof. Patrick and Jane said little, with Rochester defending the Anglican position. At one point Rochester lost his temper and angrily asked whether it was expected that he would convert on so frivolous grounds. He then composed himself, knowing how much he was risking, and complimented the divines and requested that he be given time to digest what was said. James knew now that Rochester did not intend to be convinced.|$|E
