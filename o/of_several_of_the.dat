5|$|During the negotiations, the {{relatives}} <b>of</b> <b>several</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West Side Boys {{were brought to}} the gang's camp to ask them to release the British soldiers. The gang responded that they had nothing against the soldiers, but that holding them had brought attention to their demands—which now included immunity from prosecution, safe passage to the UK to take up university courses, and guaranteed acceptance to the re-formed Sierra Leone Army.|$|E

Prior to Hurricane Ike, the University employed more than 12,000 people. Its significant growth in the 1970s and 1980s was attributable to a uniquely qualified management and medical faculty including: Mr. John Thompson; Dr. William James McGanity, Dr. William Levin, Dr. David Daeschner and many more.|$|E
5|$|If the {{election}} {{had been left}} to the papacy, Ernst {{would have been the}} choice, but the Pope was {{not a member of the}} Cathedral Chapter and Gebhard had the support <b>of</b> <b>several</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Catholic, and all the Protestant, canons in the Chapter. In December 1577, he was chosen Elector and Archbishop of Cologne after a spirited contest with the papacy's candidate, Ernst: Gebhard won {{the election}} by two votes. Although it was not required of him, Gebhard agreed to undergo priestly ordination; he was duly consecrated in March 1578, and swore to uphold the Council of Trent's decrees.|$|E
5|$|In its {{formative}} days, the Caversham Road Board administered Caversham. This organisation {{served as}} a council for Caversham until May 1877, when it became a borough. The borough of Caversham, which existed until November 1904, took in a far larger area than the current suburb, including much of Saint Clair, South Dunedin, Kew, and Kensington, and stretched to the Pacific coast {{in the south and}} Otago Harbour in the east. The names <b>of</b> <b>several</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> borough's mayors are commemorated in streets within the former borough, among them Robert Rutherford, William Bridgman, and Thomas Kay Sidey.|$|E

5|$|Initial {{grouping}} <b>of</b> <b>several</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highland terriers (including the Scottie) {{under the}} generic name Skye Terriers caused some {{confusion in the}} breed’s lineage. There is disagreement over whether the Skye Terriers mentioned in early 16th century records actually descended from forerunners of the Scottie or vice versa. It is certain, however, that Scotties and West Highland White Terriers are closely related—both their forefathers originated from the Blackmount region of Perthshire and the Moor of Rannoch. Scotties were originally bred to hunt and kill vermin on farms and to hunt badgers and foxes in the Highlands of Scotland.|$|E
5|$|King's Highway 36, {{commonly}} referred to as Highway 36, was a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario.

Today it is known as Kawartha Lakes City Road36 and Peterborough County Road36.|$|E
5|$|Krusty is a {{favorite}} character <b>of</b> <b>several</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original writers, many of whom related themselves to him and wanted to write the Krusty-focused episodes. Krusty {{was used as a}} chance for show business jokes and thus many of Krusty's experiences and anecdotes are based on real experiences and stories heard by the writers. He was a particular favorite of Brad Bird, who directed the first two Krusty episodes and always tried to animate a scene in every Krusty episode.|$|E

They convert Flounder's damaged car into an armored vehicle and hide it inside a cake-shaped breakaway float in order to sneak into the annual homecoming parade. As they wreak havoc on the event, the futures <b>of</b> <b>several</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> student main characters are revealed using freeze-frame labels.

Interspersed with these interview segments was footage, described as being in the cinéma vérité style, of {{the inside of a}} gay bar along with shots of hustlers working a street corner and a teenager being arrested in a public sex sting.|$|E

5|$|Wiglaf (died 839) was King of Mercia from 827 to 829 {{and again}} from 830 until his death.

5|$|A cat's {{gastrointestinal}} tract {{is adapted to}} meat eating, being much shorter than that of omnivores and having low levels <b>of</b> <b>several</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> digestive enzymes needed to digest carbohydrates. These traits severely limit the cat's ability to digest and use plant-derived nutrients, as well as certain fatty acids. Despite the cat's meat-oriented physiology, several vegetarian or vegan cat foods have been marketed that are supplemented with chemically synthesized taurine and other nutrients, in attempts to produce a complete diet. However, some of these products still fail to provide all the nutrients cats require, and diets containing no animal products pose the risk of causing severe nutritional deficiencies. However, veterinarians in the United States have expressed concern that many domestic cats are overfed.|$|E

5|$|After the Indian Army was {{withdrawn}} from France, Blackader was posted to a second-line Territorial Force brigade {{training in the}} United Kingdom. In 1916, it was sent to Dublin during the Easter Rising; following the Rising, Blackader presided {{over a number of}} the resulting courts-martial, including those <b>of</b> <b>several</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> signatories to the Proclamation of the Irish Republic. Later that year, he was ordered to France to take over command of the 38th (Welsh) Division, a New Army formation which had suffered heavy losses in the Battle of the Somme. He remained with the division for almost two years, helping retrain and reorganise it as an efficient fighting unit. The division would see significant successes in the Hundred Days Offensive of late 1918, but by this point Blackader was no longer in command; he had been invalided home earlier in the year. He died shortly after the war, in 1921, aged 51.|$|E
