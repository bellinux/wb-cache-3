Regulating {{the flow of}} packets through these interconnects is critical to providing good performance, particularly {{in the presence of}} extreme traffic patterns that result in sustained <b>overload</b> at <b>output</b> ports. Previous studies have used a combination of analysis and idealized simulations to show that coarse-grained scheduling of traffic flows can be effective in preventing congestion, while ensuring high utilization.

50|$|The prime {{purpose of}} foldback current {{limiting}} in linear power supplies {{is to keep}} the output transistor within its safe power dissipation limit.With a linear voltage regulator, the output voltage Vout and output current Iout are maintained by simply dissipating away the surplus of input voltage Vin:Under <b>overload</b> conditions the <b>output</b> voltage falls and so the difference Vin - Vout becomes larger, tending to increasing dissipation. For a simple current limit, safely handling the worst-case scenario (a short circuit) would therefore require a much larger heatsink and output transistor than would be required under normal operating conditions. Foldback partially solves this, helping to keep the normal-rated output transistor within its safe operating area under fault and overload conditions. Foldback also significantly reduces the power dissipation in the load in fault conditions, which can reduce the risks of fire and heat damage.|$|R
40|$|Abstract-Although most {{computer-based}} information search {{systems in}} current use employ a Boolean search strategy, there {{is by no}} means a clear consensus throughout the information retrieval research community that the conventional Boolean approach is best. The well-known drawbacks of the Boolean design include an inhospitable request formalism, frequent null <b>output</b> and <b>output</b> <b>overload,</b> and lack of provision for differing emphasis on different facets of the search. Nontraditional design principles that over-come these problems are already known and available in the research literature. In this article several such alternative approaches are sketched and their advantages over the Boolean design indicated. In the 195 Os, the era in which serious thought was first given to the possibility of computer-ized information searching, it was proposed that search requests might advantageously be formulated as Boolean combinations of document descriptors. This suggestion seemed to meet with the immediate approval of most mathematicians, computer scientists, and tech-nically oriented information professionals. At that time only Bar-Hillel, a mathematical logician, objected strenuously [I]...|$|R

The {{principle of the}} paper is to design, obtain analytical solution and compare the results with the simulation using finite elements analysis for a circular diaphragm deflection before and after touch point. By looking at MEMS devices, when the diaphragm starts touching the fixed electrode by applying loads, {{it will have a}} major effect on the overall performance of the device. Therefore, one should consider the effect of touch mode in the system to achieve good linearity, large operating pressure range and large <b>overload</b> protection at <b>output.</b> As of so far the effect of touch mode has not been evaluated efficiently in the literatures. The proposed touch mode MEMS capacitive pressure sensor demonstrated diaphragm with radius of 180 µ m, the gap depth of 0. 5 µ m and the sensor exhibit a linear response with pressure from 0. 05 Mpa to 2 Mpa...|$|R
5000|$|Voltage {{withstand}} {{testing is}} done with a high voltage source and voltage and current meters. A single instrument called a [...] "hipot tester" [...] {{is often used to}} perform this test. It applies the necessary voltages to a device and monitors leakage current. The current can trip a fault indicator. The tester has <b>output</b> <b>overload</b> protection. The test voltage may be either direct current or alternating current at power frequency or other frequency, like resonant frequency (30 to 300 Hz determined by load) or VLF (0.01 Hz to 0.1 Hz), when convenient. The maximum voltage is given in the test standard for the particular product. The application rate may also be adjusted to manage leakage currents resulting from inherent capacitive effects of the test object. The duration of the test may be up to 60 seconds or more. The applied voltage, rate of application and test duration depend on the specification requirements of the equipment. Different test standards apply for consumer electronics, military electrical devices, high voltage cables, switchgear and other apparatus.|$|R

They {{are available in}} a 1. 8 W SO package. Typical dropouts are 320 mV at 5 V and 500 mA, or 240 mV at 3. 3 V and 200 mA. Quiescent currents are 15 µA typ and 35 µA max. Shutdown turns off all circuitry and puts the regulator in a 2 µA off mode. A unique protection scheme limits reverse currents when the input voltage falls below the output. Other features include foldback current limiting and thermal <b>overload</b> protection. The <b>output</b> is preset at 3. 3 V for the MAX 604 and 5 V for the MAX 603. In addition, both devices employ Dual Mode ™ operation, allowing user-adjustable outputs from 1. 25 V to 11 V using external resistors. The input voltage supply range is 2. 7 V to 11. 5 V. The MAX 603 /MAX 604 feature a 500 mA P-channel MOSFET pass transistor. This transistor allows the devices to draw less than 35 µA over temperature, independent of the output current. The supply current remains low because the P-channel MOSFET pass transistor draws no base currents (unlike the PNP transistors of conventional bipolar linear regulators). Also, when the input-to-output voltage differential becomes small, the internal P-channel MOSFET does not suffer from excessive base current losses that occur with saturated PNP transistors...|$|R
40|$|The {{low-voltage}} semiconductor {{circuit boards}} in advanced telecom systems require the power supplies {{to have some}} key features such as the very low voltage, very high current, very high slew-rate load transients, high power density and low cost. The objective of this thesis is to find solutions to satisfy these requirements without sacrificing the cost, efficiency and usable on-board space. In order to achieve this objective, this thesis proposes two distributed point-of-use power supply architectures (DPUPS) suitable for different configurations of the low-voltage semiconductor circuit boards. In order to implement the proposed DPUPS architectures, this thesis presents two improved soft switching forward converter topologies (Type 1 and Type 2). These two topologies both employ the simplified power transformers that achieve self-reset without using the conventional resetting winding, and they both guarantee the soft switching under all operating conditions without complicating the control scheme. Based on the two improved soft-switching converter topologies, two DPUPS architectures are developed. Both architectures have common merits such as the soft switching, single stage power conversion, minimized length of the high current PCB tracks and reduced PCB copper area, independent and tight voltage regulation {{at the point of}} load, instantaneous response to the system dc bus variations, elimination of the cross regulation between multiple outputs, inherent protection against <b>overloading</b> or the <b>output</b> short-circuit condition, capable of high closed-loop bandwidth, and reduced number of power components for multiple output applications. In comparison between these two DPUPS architectures, the one that is implemented with the proposed Type 1 topology is optimal for a circuit board with the heavy current loads collocating, while the other one that is implemented with the Type 2 topology serves better for a circuit board with the heavy current loads distributed at different points. In this thesis, detailed steady state and small signal analyses are performed, the performance of the proposed architectures are characterized, and the design procedures are generated. Simulation and experimental results obtained from prototype circuits are used to verify the analyses and design and to serve as the proof of concepts. The results indicate that the proposed DPUPS architectures provide promising solutions to satisfy the power requirements of the low-voltage semiconductor circuits...|$|R
