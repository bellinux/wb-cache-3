5|$|In {{the early}} 1600s England was at peace and Pendennis was neglected; {{reportedly}} the garrison's pay {{was two years}} in arrears, forcing them to gather limpets from the shoreline for food. Nonetheless, a new Italian-styled gatehouse {{was added to the}} castle, probably in 1611. War with Spain broke <b>out</b> <b>again</b> 1624 and a new defensive line, with bastions and artillery, was built across the peninsula in 1627.|$|E
5|$|It is {{the nature}} of man to build the most {{complicated}} cage of rules and regulations in which to trap himself, and then, with equal ingenuity and zest, to bend his brain to the problem of wriggling triumphantly <b>out</b> <b>again.</b> Lent was a challenge; the game was to ferret out the loopholes.|$|E

5|$|As U.S. troop {{withdrawals}} continued, conscription {{was reduced}} and in 1973 ended; {{the armed forces}} became all-volunteer. After years of fighting, the Paris Peace Accords were signed {{at the beginning of}} 1973. The agreement implemented a cease fire and allowed for the withdrawal of remaining American troops without requiring the 160,000 North Vietnam Army regulars located in the South to withdraw. Once American combat support ended, there was a brief truce, before fighting broke <b>out</b> <b>again.</b> North Vietnam conquered South Vietnam in 1975.|$|E

He completed the loan spell with one goal from 18 appearances as Southport finished 18th in the Conference Premier. At the end of the season, Brodie was released by Gateshead in May 2014.|$|E
5|$|Civil {{war broke}} <b>out</b> <b>again</b> in England in 1215 between forces loyal to King John and rebel barons, {{supported}} {{in due course}} by Prince Louis of France. John annexed the castle in 1214 and William sided with the rebels in 1216. King John responded by sending forces to attack the castle and successfully retook it. Despite John's death, the war continued until forces loyal to John's young son, Henry III, finally achieved victory over the rebels in 1217.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{eagerness to}} start <b>out</b> <b>again,</b> Amundsen waited until mid-October {{and the first}} hints of spring. He was ready to leave on 15October, but was held up by the weather {{for a few more}} days. On 19October 1911 the five men, with four sledges and fifty-two dogs, began their journey. The weather quickly worsened, and in heavy fog the party strayed into the field of crevasses that Johansen's depot party had {{discovered}} the previous autumn. Wisting later recalled how his sledge, with Amundsen aboard, nearly disappeared down a crevasse when the snow bridge broke underneath it.|$|E
50|$|On May 2, 2002, Bret Boone and Mike Cameron of the Seattle Mariners hit {{back-to-back}} {{home runs}} off of starter Jon Rauch {{in the first}} inning of a game against the Chicago White Sox.

5|$|During {{the first}} timed runs in Q2, Lewis Hamilton was seven-tenths {{of a second}} quicker than {{teammate}} Rosberg, while the Ferrari cars split the pair to place provisional second and third. Nevertheless, both Mercedes drivers did not go <b>out</b> <b>again.</b> Sebastian Vettel set a second timed lap to improve his time, now {{a little more than}} a tenth behind Hamilton. Many drivers only set one timed lap towards the end of the session, with Pastor Maldonado, Felipe Nasr, Carlos Sainz Jr. and Daniil Kvyat unable to move on into Q3, while Ricciardo did not set a time, leaving him fifteenth for the time being.|$|E
5|$|Fighting {{immediately}} broke <b>out</b> <b>again</b> {{along the}} Normandy borders, where Henry of Champagne and Robert captured {{the town of}} Neufmarché-sur-Epte. Louis's forces moved to attack Aquitaine. Stephen responded by placing Wallingford Castle, a key fortress loyal to Henry along the Thames Valley, under siege, possibly {{in an attempt to}} force a successful end to the English conflict while Henry was still fighting for his territories in France. Henry moved quickly in response, avoiding open battle with Louis in Aquitaine and stabilising the Norman border, pillaging the Vexin and then striking south into Anjou against Geoffrey, capturing one of his main castles. Louis fell ill and withdrew from the campaign, and Geoffrey was forced {{to come to terms with}} Henry.|$|E
5|$|Following the Georgia Tech punt, Wake Forest {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the second quarter. Wake Forest, after a three and <b>out,</b> <b>again</b> punted the ball and Georgia Tech took over on offense. On their first full possession of the second quarter, Tech seemed to have more success moving the ball. Quarterback Reggie Ball picked up a first down running the ball, then completed a 22-yard pass to wide receiver Calvin Johnson, driving the Yellow Jackets inside Wake Forest territory. Once there, however, Wake Forest's defense stiffened. Ball was unable to complete two consecutive passes, and his third pass inside Wake Forest territory was intercepted.|$|E

5|$|In early 1803, the Duke of York {{appointed}} Ernest {{as commander}} of the Severn District, {{in charge of the}} forces in and around the Severn Estuary. When war with France broke <b>out</b> <b>again</b> after the Peace of Amiens, the elder Duke appointed Ernest to the more important Southwest District, comprising Hampshire, Dorset and Wiltshire. Though Ernest would have preferred command of the King's German Legion, composed mostly of expatriates from French-occupied Hanover, he accepted the post. The Duke of Cumberland increased the defences on the South Coast, especially around the town of Weymouth, where his father often spent time in the summer.|$|E
5|$|In early August 1942, a small {{detachment}} of an American fighter control squadron had been stationed on Goodenough Island to provide advance {{warning to the}} Australian fighters based at Milne Bay. On 7 August, five Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) P-40 Kittyhawks of No. 76 Squadron made forced landings on the grassy plains. One crashed on landing {{and had to be}} written off, but after makeshift airstrips were cut through the grass, the remaining four were able to fly <b>out</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
5|$|In second practice, Hamilton {{was again}} quickest {{but was also}} caught <b>out</b> <b>again.</b> He went off at the turn ten hairpin and crashed his car while {{he was doing a}} run on {{intermediate}} tyres in wet conditions– a downpour of rain affected {{the second half of the}} session. Most teams sent their drivers out only in the dry first half, setting times on the super-soft tyre compound. Ferrari looked to be significantly closer to Mercedes, with Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen finishing second and third respectively, less than 0.4 seconds behind Hamilton. Lotus confirmed their good pace from the first session when Pastor Maldonado was fifth fastest, behind Rosberg.|$|E
