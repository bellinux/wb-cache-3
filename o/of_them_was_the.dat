5|$|Although {{in places}} {{there was a}} mixture of {{different}} companies and platoons dug in together, the Australians were deployed with the 8th Battalion in the south still centred on Bolton's Ridge. North of them, covering the southern sector of 400 Plateau, were the mixed together 6th and 7th Battalions, both now commanded by Colonel Walter McNicoll of the 6th. North <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> 5th Battalion, and the 10th Battalion covered the northern sector of 400 Plateau at Johnston's Jolly. But by now they were battalions in name only, having all taken heavy casualties; the commanders had little accurate knowledge of where their men were located.|$|E

5|$|Sweden's {{weak economy}} had {{suffered}} {{during the war}} and was now in a deep crisis. Charles assembled the Riksdag of the Estates in October 1680. The assembly has been described {{as one of the most}} important held by the Riksdag of the Estates. Here, the king finally pushed through the reduction ordeal, something that had been discussed in the Riksdag since 1650. It meant that any land or object previously owned by the crown and lent or given away— including counties, baronies and lordships— could be recovered. It affected many prominent members of the nobility, some of whom were ruined by it. One <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> former guardian and Lord Chief Justice Magnus De La Gardie, who, among many other Estates, had to return the extravagant 248-room Läckö Castle. The reduction process involved the examination of every title deed in the kingdom, including the dominions, and it resulted in a complete readjustment of the nation's finances.|$|E

One <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first perfect game in franchise history, by Félix Hernández, making them the first team to be on both the losing and winning end of a perfect game in the same season, and marking the first time two perfect games were thrown in the same park in the same season.|$|E

They were fairly isolated (only seven were confirmed across the entire region over a 24-hour period) but three significant tornadoes formed from two simultaneous supercells in southern Indiana and western Kentucky — one <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> deadly Evansville tornado.|$|E

5|$|For {{the purpose}} of Operation Uranus, Soviet Marshal Georgy Zhukov {{deployed}} eleven Soviet armies. In an effort to bolster the offensive capabilities of the Stalingrad Front, over 420 tanks, 111,000 soldiers and 556 artillery guns were shipped over the Volga River {{in a period of}} three weeks. The Red Army and Red Air Force were able to amass over one million soldiers, 13,500 artillery guns, 890 tanks and 1,100 combat aircraft, organized into 66 rifle divisions, five tank corps, 14 tank brigades, a single mechanized brigade, a cavalry corps, and 127 artillery and mortar regiments. As the encirclement closed and the Soviets continued with secondary operations, the 51st Army was positioned {{on the edge of the}} outer encirclement with 34,000 men and 77 tanks. South <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> 28th Army, with 44,000 soldiers, 40 tanks and 707 artillery guns and mortars. Concurrently, the Red Army began building its strength for Operation Saturn, in which it would aim to isolate and destroy German Army Group A in the Caucasus.|$|E

25|$|Early Buddhist monks did {{not doubt}} the {{existence}} of kami but saw them as inferior to their buddhas. Hindu deities had had the same reception: They were thought of as non-illuminated and prisoners of saṃsāra. Buddhist claims of superiority, however, encountered resistance; monks tried to overcome it by deliberately integrating kami in their system. Japanese Buddhists themselves wanted to somehow give the kami equal status. Several strategies to do this were developed and employed, and one <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> honji suijaku theory.|$|E

The German support under the Ryti-Ribbentrop Agreement had prevented a disaster, but it was believed the country {{would not be able}} to hold another major attack.
