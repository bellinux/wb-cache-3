5|$|For {{the march}} itself, Gandhi wanted the strictest {{discipline}} and adherence to satyagraha and ahimsa. For that reason, he recruited the marchers not from Congress Party members, {{but from the}} residents of his own ashram, who were trained in Gandhi's strict standards of discipline. The 24-day march would pass through 4 districts and 48 villages. The route of the march, along with each evening's stopping place, was planned based on recruitment potential, past contacts, and timing. Gandhi sent scouts to each village ahead of the march so he could plan his talks at each resting place, based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> of the local residents. Events at each village were scheduled and publicised in Indian and foreign press.|$|E

5|$|During the 2011 Canadian federal election, Harper {{promised to}} {{establish}} the NAP-CHT by 2012 and to invest $20 million into it. The annual budget of British Columbia's Office to Combat Trafficking in Persons (OCTIP) was reduced by $200,000 a few months later. OCTIP was Canada's only provincial government agency responsible for coordinating efforts to address human trafficking. The federal government held a round table to determine {{the contents of the}} NAP-CHT. Carleen McGuinty, child protection specialist for the Christian NGO World Vision Canada, said at the discussion that the NAP-CHT should focus <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> of children and that the plan should not emphasize child sexual abuse to the exclusion of addressing child labour. Smith said that she was confident that Harper would have her review the plan before it was established.

5|$|In 1933, {{she took}} Prime Minister İsmet İnönü from Varna to Istanbul {{and carried the}} Shah of Iran from Trebizond to Samsun the {{following}} year. Yavuz Sultan Selim had her name officially shortened to Yavuz Sultan in 1930 and then to Yavuz in 1936. Another short refit was conducted in 1938, and in November that year she carried the remains of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk from Istanbul to İzmit. She and the other ships of the navy were considered outdated by the British Naval Attache by 1937, partly due to their substandard anti-aircraft armament, but in 1938 the Turkish government began planning to expand the force. Under these plans the surface fleet was to comprise two 10,000 ton cruisers and twelve destroyers. Yavuz would be retained until the second cruiser was commissioned in 1945, and the navy expected to build a 23,000 ton ship between 1950 and 1960. The naval building program did not come about, as the foreign shipyards which were to build the ships concentrated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> of their own nations leading up to World War II.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{for rapid}} transit {{prior to the}} {{creation}} of WMATA in February 1967 focused <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> of commuters while neglecting some of the District's less affluent neighborhoods. However, by late 1966, some plans started to include a line along 7th Street in the District of Columbia. The new line was included in WMATA's master plan for its proposed then-101-mile system in 1968. At that time, a Green Line was planned to pass through some of the area's poorest and most transit-dependent neighborhoods and provide them with subway service. Riots following the death of Martin Luther King in 1968 destroyed much of the commercial district around 14th and U Streets and planners hoped that adding a subway stop in that area would stimulate redevelopment. The original 1969 plan called for a line under 13th Street NW with just two stations. However, in 1970, the District of Columbia Council agreed to pay an additional $3 million to add a third station and reroute the Green Line under U Street, and then 14th Street NW. Instead of opening in 1976, the first Green Line stations opened in 1991. The southern part of the Green Line was originally to pass over the 11th Street Bridges to the intersection of Good Hope Road SE and Martin Luther King, Jr., Avenue SE, follow Martin Luther King, Jr., Avenue SE to Suitland Parkway, down Suitland Parkway to Branch Avenue SE, and down Branch Avenue to a terminus at the intersection of Branch Avenue and the Capital Beltway. Public hearings on whether to build a Green Line and the route it should take were completed in 1973, and portions of the Green Line was originally scheduled to open in 1976.|$|E

Using multiple regression, I analyzed the relationship between co-curricular involvement and <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for cognition while controlling for sex, race, pretest, precollege academic motivation, SES, precollege academic ability, high school involvement, institutional type, work, residence, major, non-classroom interactions with faculty, and the kind of instruction. I also analyzed whether race, sex, or the type of institution students 2 ̆ 7 attend further influenced the effect of involvement <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for cognition <b>The</b> main effects model found the impact of involvement <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for cognition to be statistically non-significant. While looking at conditional effects, I found being involved had a small, but positive, statistically significant impact <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for cognition for non-white students. Also during this exploration I found sex and institutional type did not significantly impact the effects of involvement <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for cognition. <b>The</b> suggestions for future research include replicating the current study and examining the impact of specific co-curricular involvement opportunities; following-up this study with a qualitative study to discover what students are gaining from co-curricular involvement; looking for additional conditional effects; and exploring what other college experiences impact <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for cognition...|$|R
