5|$|Last Man Standing: Similar to Deathmatch, the player's {{objective}} is to remain alive longer than their opponents, putting an emphasis on number of deaths rather than kills. Players start with all weapons (except the Redeemer) available, fully loaded, and have a set number <b>of</b> <b>lives.</b> Power-ups, including health and ammunition packs, are unavailable. Once a player runs out <b>of</b> <b>lives,</b> they lose.|$|E

5|$|According to a myth in many cultures, cats have {{multiple}} lives. In many countries, they {{are believed to}} have nine lives, but in Italy, Germany, Greece, Brazil and some Spanish-speaking regions, they are said to have seven lives, while in Turkish and Arabic traditions, the number <b>of</b> <b>lives</b> is six. The myth is attributed to the natural suppleness and swiftness cats exhibit to escape life-threatening situations. Also lending credence to this myth is the fact that falling cats often land on their feet, using an instinctive righting reflex to twist their bodies around. Nonetheless, cats can still be injured or killed by a high fall.|$|E

5|$|Kirby's Dream Land was {{designed}} by Masahiro Sakurai, who intended {{it to be a}} simple game that could be easy to pick up and play even by those unfamiliar with action games.

5|$|Similarly to Sonic Advance 1 and 2 before it, Advance 3 is a fast-paced 2D platformer. The player {{controls}} {{one of five}} characters {{simultaneously with}} a second one as a sidekick; alternately, a second player joins and one controls each character. The two characters run and jump {{through a series of}} seven levels, destroying robots along the way. The player collects rings in levels and boss battles as a form of health: upon being hit by an enemy or harmful obstacle, the player's rings will scatter and can be recollected. Being hit while carrying no rings, being crushed by an obstacle, or falling into a bottomless pit causes death; running out <b>of</b> <b>lives</b> incurs a game over screen.|$|E

5|$|The imprisoned {{soldiers}} {{received two}} {{meals a day}} of steamed rice, occasionally accompanied by fruit, soup, or meat. To supplement their diet, prisoners were able to smuggle food and supplies hidden in their underwear into the camp during Japanese-approved trips to Cabanatuan. To prevent extra food, jewelry, diaries, and other valuables from being confiscated, items were hidden in clothing or latrines, or were buried before scheduled inspections. Prisoners collected food {{using a variety of}} methods including stealing, bribing guards, planting gardens, and killing animals which entered the camp such as mice, snakes, ducks, and stray dogs. The Filipino underground collected thousands of quinine tablets to smuggle into the camp to treat malaria, saving hundreds <b>of</b> <b>lives.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{player has}} a number <b>of</b> <b>lives</b> upon {{starting}} the game, and should they die a gravestone will appear at their location and stay in place {{as long as the}} player has lives left.

5|$|The {{rules that}} can be used in a match vary {{depending}} on the game, but the most commonly used settings across all games are Time and Stock. Time mode uses a point based system in which fighters earn points for knocking out their opponents and lose points for being knocked out or self-destructing (i.e. falling out of the arena by themselves). The player with the highest score at the end of the set time limit wins the match. Survival uses a life-based system in which players are given a set number <b>of</b> <b>lives,</b> known as stock, with each fighter losing a life whenever they are knocked out, becoming eliminated if they run out <b>of</b> <b>lives.</b> The winner is the last fighter standing once all other fighters are eliminated or, if a time-limit is applied to the match, the fighter with the most lives remaining once time runs out. In the event of a tie, such as two or more fighters sharing the highest score/life count at the end of the time limit or remaining fighters losing their last life simultaneously, a Sudden Death match takes place. Here, each of the tied fighters are given a starting damage percentage of 300%, making them easier to launch off the stage, and the last fighter standing wins the match. In some games this process is repeated if the match ends in another tie.|$|E
