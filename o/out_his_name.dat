He continued to give interviews to the media, being open about the fact that he was dying of AIDS, and sought in particular to highlight the impact that the disease was having in the African-American community. In an interview with the NME, he stated, [...] "I don't believe that AIDS is the wrath of God. People have a tendency to blame everything on God." ...|$|E

The concert begins before Louise can exit, and she remains unimpressed until the band's prepubescent youngest member, Boo Boo, comes onstage. Louise is left frozen in awe by his looks, and once the band's first song starts she starts excitedly screaming <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>name.</b> Horrified at what she has done, she runs out in denial about liking Boo Boo, having never had a previous crush.|$|E

Unable to find enough such people still alive at Janowska, Wilhaus ordered a roundup of prisoners from the {{satellite}} camps. Wiesenthal and two other inmates {{were taken from the}} Eastern Railway camp to the execution site, a trench [...] deep and [...] long at a nearby sandpit. The men were stripped and led through [...] "the Hose", a six- or seven-foot wide barbed wire corridor to the execution ground. The victims were shot and their bodies allowed to fall into the pit. Wiesenthal, waiting to be shot, heard someone called <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>name.</b> He was returned alive to the camp; Kohlrautz had convinced his superiors that Wiesenthal was the best man available to paint a giant poster in honour of Hitler's birthday.|$|E

500|$|The {{producers}} asked United Artists for financing, but {{the studio}} would only put up $1 million. Later, the UK arm of United Artists provided an extra $100,000 {{to create the}} climax where Dr. No's base explodes. As {{a result of the}} low budget, only one sound editor was hired (normally there are two, for sound effects and dialogue), and many pieces of scenery were made in cheaper ways, with M's office featuring cardboard paintings and a door covered in a leather-like plastic, the room where Dent meets Dr. No costing only £745 to build, and the aquarium in Dr. No's base being magnified stock footage of goldfish. Furthermore, when art director Syd Cain found <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> was not in the credits, Broccoli gave him a golden pen to compensate, saying {{that he did not want}} to spend money making the credits again. Production designer Ken Adam later told UK daily newspaper The Guardian in 2005: [...] "The budget for Dr No was under $1m for the whole picture. My budget was £14,500. I filled three stages at Pinewood full of sets while they were filming in Jamaica. It wasn't a real aquarium in Dr No's apartment. It was a disaster to tell you the truth because we had so little money. We decided to use a rear projection screen and get some stock footage of fish. What we didn't realise was because we didn't have much money the only stock footage they could buy was of goldfish-sized fish, so we had to blow up the size and put a line in the dialogue with Bond talking about the magnification. I didn't see any reason why Dr No shouldn't have good taste so we mixed contemporary furniture and antiques. We thought it would be fun for him to have some stolen art so we used Goya's Portrait of the Duke of Wellington, which was still missing at the time. I got hold of a slide from the National Gallery - this was on the Friday, shooting began on the Monday - and I painted a Goya over the weekend. It was pretty good so they used it for publicity purposes but, just like the real one, it got stolen while it was on display." ...|$|E

A poem he published during the same year ridicules King Carol I {{on the occasion of}} his fortieth year in power, while parodying the style of republican poet N. T.

Judge Rosemary Barkett, in dissent, expressed her belief that as Davis might prove his innocence, {{it would be wrong}} to execute him.

2500|$|When Haman's name is {{read out}} loud during the public {{chanting}} of the Megillah in the synagogue, which occurs 54 times, the congregation engages in noise-making to blot <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>name.</b> The practice {{can be traced}} back to the Tosafists (the leading French and German rabbis of the 13th century).

[...] A custom developed of writing the name of Haman, the offspring of Amalek, on two smooth stones, and knocking them together until the name was blotted out. Some wrote the name of Haman on the soles of their shoes, and at the mention of the name stamped with their feet as a sign of contempt. Another method was to use a noisy ratchet, called a ra'ashan (from the Hebrew ra-ash, meaning [...] "noise") and in Yiddish a [...] Some of the rabbis protested against these uproarious excesses, considering them a disturbance of public worship, but the custom of using a ratchet in the synagogue on Purim is now universal, with the exception of Spanish and Portuguese Jews, who consider them a breach of decorum.|$|E

Gardar & the other men in the village left the village only to be unaware that raiders came and captured everybody and sold them as slaves, killing the newborn & elderly in the process. During the night Arneis visits Gardar secretly without Snake's permission and Gardar bribes her into freeing him which she does, in the process he murders the guards and escapes into the night. During an investigation it is revealed that Gardar has been wounded several times and is in critical condition. Later Snake sets up a look out party in Arneis' house and awaits for Gardar's return, but is unaware Arneis has hidden him under the bed. Thorfinn & Einar then plot an escape plan for Arneis & Gardar in which Einar is disguised as Gardar and lures the guards away whilst Thorfinn helps Arneis' escape with Gardar, but Snake sees through their plan and begins a duel with Thorfinn. During the duel Snake reveals {{that he and his}} men are really criminals who were on the run and found shelter at Ketil's farm. He explains that they all use animal names to hide their real identities, then stabs the unconscious Gardar through the heart, but Gardar wakes up and begins strangling him. Thorfinn tries to loosen Gardar's grip on Snake but it is Arneis who manages to calm Gardar down. They then both set off to the road together in a cart, however Gardar begins to feel faint and rests his head upon Arneis' lap. He dies of his wounds.|$|E
