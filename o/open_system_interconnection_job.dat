25|$|The <b>Open</b> <b>Systems</b> <b>Interconnection</b> (OSI) model (ISO/IEC 7498-1) is a {{conceptual}} model that characterizes and standardizes the internal functions of a communication system by partitioning it into abstraction layers. The {{model is a}} product of the <b>Open</b> <b>Systems</b> <b>Interconnection</b> project at the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The model groups similar communication functions into one of seven logical layers. A layer serves the layer above it and is served by the layer below it. For example, a layer that provides error-free communications across a network provides the path needed by applications above it, while it calls the next lower layer to send and receive packets that make up the contents of that path. Two instances at one layer are connected by a horizontal connection on that layer.|$|R
