Of the 16 forms sent to providers, 10 were returned. Four additional patients brought their own medical records to the interviews. Therefore, additional limited medical information from medical providers {{was available for}} 14 participants. PBC diagnosis was confirmed in all 14 patients, with a mean (standard deviation) duration of disease of 9.6 (6.0) years. Twelve of these 14 participants (86 %) had received ursodeoxycholic acid (past or present) to treat their PBC. Only 4 reported they were currently using medication to relieve their itching.|$|R
40|$|We give a brief {{discussion}} of denoising algorithms for depth data and review our unified approach towards non-local denoising. This algorithm removes outliers from depth data and accordingly achieves an unbiased smooth-ing result. Taking into consideration the intra-patch sim-ilarity and <b>optional</b> color <b>information,</b> strong discontinu-ities can be handled and fine detail structure in the data can be preserved. To account for the high computational com-plexity of the algorithm, we examine a parallel formula-tion, present different data and task decomposition strate-gies and investigate their applicability towards a GPU im-plementation. We demonstrate that this approach scales very well and that a significant speed-up can be achieved. 1...|$|R

Hardware from other vendors often used sample rates as high as 8192 Hz, often integer factors of video clock signals. Newer files have a header that consists of six unsigned 32-bit words, an <b>optional</b> <b>information</b> chunk and then the data (in big endian format).|$|E

This application required complex decision logic and a frequently modified rule base. The techniques are evaluated for execution efficiency and implementation ease; the criterion used to calculate the execution efficiency is the total number of steps required to isolate hypotheses that were true and the criteria used to evaluate the implementability are ease of modification and verification and explanation capability. It is observed that the traditional program is more efficient than the rule-based program; however, the rule-based programming technique is more applicable for improving programmer productivity...|$|R
