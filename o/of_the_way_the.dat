5|$|As {{a result}} of his performances, Fingleton was {{recalled}} to the Test team for the tour of South Africa in 1935–36, where he partnered Brown {{at the top of the}} innings. Under normal circumstances, the Australians would have been captained by Fingleton's rival Bradman, who had been vice-captain to Woodfull. However, Bradman was unable to tour for medical reasons and Vic Richardson led the team instead. With Bradman out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>the</b> tour was to be the most prolific and peaceful phase of Fingleton's international career and included several large opening stands with Brown. During the tour, Fingleton played with an attacking flair that contrasted with his established reputation for doggedness. For Fingleton, it was the happiest tour he had been on, in large part due to Bradman's absence.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Bean {{often seems}} unaware of basic aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> world works, and the {{programme}} usually features his attempts at what {{would normally be}} considered simple activities, such as going swimming, using a television set, interior decorating, or going to church. The humour largely comes from his original (and often absurd) solutions to problems and his total disregard for others when solving them, his pettiness, and occasional malevolence.|$|E
5|$|The {{laws are}} {{concerned}} with setting and enforcing the penalties for transgressions {{at all levels of}} society; the severity of the fine depended on the social rank of the victim. The king had a financial interest in enforcement, for part of the fines would come to him in many cases, but the king also was responsible for law and order, and avoiding blood feuds by enforcing the rules on compensation for injury was part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> king maintained control. Æthelberht's laws are mentioned by Alfred the Great, who compiled his own laws, making use of the prior codes created by Æthelberht, {{as well as those of}} Offa of Mercia and Ine of Wessex.|$|E
50|$|Citizens {{participate}} {{in one of}} several ways, depending on their personal nature. <b>Ways</b> include <b>the</b> <b>Way</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Oracle, <b>the</b> <b>Way</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Monk, <b>the</b> <b>Way</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Knight, <b>the</b> <b>Way</b> <b>of</b> Health, <b>the</b> <b>Way</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Word, <b>the</b> <b>Way</b> <b>of</b> Art & Work, and many others. Most citizens live in houses of 10-20 people each, federated together into <b>the</b> Federation <b>of</b> Damanhur.|$|R
50|$|From August to November every year, every Countdown store {{around the}} country fundraisers to help sick {{children}} around <b>the</b> country. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>the</b> raise money include, selling $2 wristbands, and $5 raffle tickets for purchase by customers.|$|R
25|$|There {{are three}} {{approaches}} to reduce <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> bird strikes. <b>The</b> vehicles {{can be designed}} to be more bird resistant, the birds can be moved out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicle, or the vehicle can be moved out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> birds.|$|R
5|$|The problem {{occurred}} because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> vehicles were modified for right-hand-drive. The investigation showed {{that although the}} brake pedal had been moved to the right, it was still connected to a mechanism on the passenger side. This was covered by felt carpet and meant that both the front passenger and driver could activate the brakes. A further investigation by Watchdog later found the same problem in other Citroën models and some vehicles produced by Renault and Peugeot, {{some of which were}} registered in 2002. All three manufacturers worked with the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) to identify the severity of the problem but no vehicles were found to be affected enough to issue recalls.|$|E
5|$|The second {{match was}} Tyson Tomko, {{accompanied}} by Trish Stratus, versus Chris Jericho. In {{the early stages}} both competitors wrestled inconclusively, reversed each other's attacks, before Tyson backed Jericho into the ring corner and hit him numerous times with his elbows. Afterwards, Jericho attempted to perform the Lionsault, but Tomko rolled out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> <b>The</b> match concluded as Jericho performed an enzuigiri on Tomko for the win.|$|E
5|$|After {{the sudden}} and {{unexpected}} death of Carneiro Leão in September 1856, his cabinet only {{managed to survive}} him by a few months. The Emperor, although critical <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> Conciliation had been implemented, had learned to appreciate its merits and was eager that it continue. PedroII's support gave the Conciliation another chance, and allowed Paranhos to return to government once more as Foreign Minister on 12 December 1858. The most pressing issue facing Paranhos was the Paraguayan government's persistent refusal to allow Brazilian ships access to Mato Grosso province. At that time, the best and fastest way to reach that distant Brazilian province was to travel via the Atlantic and from there up the rivers which flow between the nations south of Brazil. One {{of the reasons for}} Brazil's war against Argentina in 1851 was to assure the free passage of its ships. The crisis between Brazil and Paraguay had dragged on since Paranhos's tenure as Foreign Minister in Carneiro Leão's cabinet. On 12 February 1858, Paranhos signed a treaty with Paraguay which allowed Brazilian ships unrestricted navigation of Paraguayan rivers. This prevented the outbreak of war—or at least deferred the conflict until 1864.|$|E
50|$|Average cost pricing is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>the</b> {{government}} regulates {{a monopoly}} market. Monopolists tend to produce {{less than the}} optimal quantity pushing the prices up. The government may use average cost pricing {{as a tool to}} regulate prices monopolists may charge.|$|R
50|$|Gerrymandering, {{exclusion}} of opposition candidates from eligibility for office, needlessly high restrictions on {{who may be}} a candidate, like ballot access rules, and manipulating thresholds for electoral success are some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>the</b> structure <b>of</b> an election can be changed to favor a specific faction or candidate.|$|R
50|$|As of 2010, 470 {{students}} from various communities within LAUSD attend <b>the</b> school. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> racial quotas, 40% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students are White and 60% are {{racial and ethnic}} minorities. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>the</b> application process gives favor to residents of other communities, children from Bel-Air generally do not attend the school.|$|R
5|$|In late 1902, the PC plans {{collapsed}} after {{a falling}} {{out between the}} scheme's promoters led to {{a crucial part of}} the planned route coming under the control of a rival, the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL), which withdrew it from parliamentary consideration. With the PC scheme out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>the</b> CLR resubmitted its bill in 1903, although consideration was again held up by Parliament's establishment of a Royal Commission on London Traffic tasked to assess the manner in which transport in London should be developed. While the Commission deliberated, any review of bills for new lines and extensions was postponed, so the CLR withdrew the bill. The CLR briefly re-presented the bill for the 1905 parliamentary session but withdrew it again, before making an agreement with the UERL in October 1905 that neither company would submit a bill for an east–west route in 1906. The plan was then dropped as the new trains with driving positions at both ends made it possible for the CLR to reduce the minimum interval between trains to two minutes without building the loop.|$|E
5|$|Now infected, Wesley uses {{a digital}} sample of Captain Picard's voice to lure key {{engineering}} crew-members {{away from the}} engineering deck. He erects a force field around the area with his tractor beam device and assumes control of the ship. He allows one of the engineers, Mr. Shimoda (Benjamin W.S. Lum), who is acting in a childlike manner, into the force field. Mr. Shimoda manages to remove all of the isolinear chips from the engine control station and plays with them like toys. As the supergiant star collapses, a fragment is blown into a direct impact course with the two Federation ships, and without the chips in place, they cannot move out of its way. Chief Engineer Sarah MacDougal (Brooke Bundy) manages to disable Wesley's force field, and Data is sent to replace the chips. He reports {{that he will not}} have enough time. Wesley reverses the ship's tractor beam, repelling the Enterprise off the Tsiolkovsky, giving themselves the necessary additional seconds for Data to replace the chips enabling the ship to move out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> <b>The</b> crew is cured of the ailment, and Picard partially credits Wesley for helping to prevent a disaster.|$|E
5|$|Ruth {{made his}} first {{appearance}} as a professional ballplayer in an inter-squad game on March 7, 1914. He played shortstop and pitched the last two innings of a 15–9 victory. In his second at-bat, Ruth hit a long home run to right field; the blast was locally reported to be longer than a legendary shot hit by Jim Thorpe in Fayetteville. Ruth made first appearance against a team in organized baseball in an exhibition game versus the major-league Philadelphia Phillies. Ruth pitched the middle three innings and gave up two runs in the fourth, but then settled down and pitched a scoreless fifth and sixth innings. In {{a game against the}} Phillies the following afternoon, Ruth entered during the sixth inning and did not allow a run the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> <b>The</b> Orioles scored seven runs {{in the bottom of the}} eighth inining to overcome a 6–0 deficit, and Ruth was the winning pitcher.|$|E
50|$|At <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> Part Two <b>the</b> Doctor {{asks the}} Fendahl skull {{if it would}} like a jelly baby, but {{actually}} offers it a liquorice allsort. This was commented on in <b>the</b> 'Watchdog' segment <b>of</b> Nationwide; <b>the</b> Doctor Who production office replied by saying that this was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>the</b> Doctor liked to confuse his enemy.|$|R

5|$|The new route added several locks to the canal, making {{water supply}} {{problems}} more severe. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> system of locks work, water is lost {{from the upper}} part of a canal each time a vessel passes through. This is a particular issue for the pound between Bradford Lock at Bradford on Avon and the Bath Locks, where a series of locks need to be opened each time the gates are opened. Most lock gates are not watertight, therefore some water leaks from the higher levels of the canal to those lower down. The water has to be replaced, or eventually the upper levels of the canal would not hold enough water to be navigable. Canals are usually fed by diverting water from streams and rivers into the upper parts of the canal, but if no suitable source is available or sufficient, a pumping station, such as the one at Claverton, can be used to maintain the water level. Crofton Pumping Station was built to supply water to the summit pound of the canal, opening in 1810 but, unlike Claverton, was powered by steam.|$|E
25|$|Wilkerson {{is one of}} {{the people}} interviewed in the 2007 {{documentary}} film No End in Sight, a film that is very critical <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> occupation of Iraq was handled in the spring of 2003.|$|E
25|$|Circus World {{was never}} successful, as its {{standard}} carnival-type rides were {{no match for}} Disney's state-of-the-art attractions and was out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> <b>The</b> circus sold the park to Arizona developer James Monaghan in 1984.|$|E

50|$|During <b>the</b> summer <b>of</b> 2010, NBA superstar LeBron James {{left the}} Cleveland Cavaliers in free agency, {{in a highly}} publicized media affair that culminated in a TV special called The Decision. <b>The</b> {{majority}} owner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> team (at the time), Dan Gilbert, reacted by posting a letter to Cavalier fans. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>the</b> letter was heavily derided was for its use of Comic Sans font.|$|R

25|$|The opt-outs {{were only}} {{available}} to listeners on the FM frequencies. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> DAB and digital TV services of Radio 1 are broadcast (a single-frequency network on DAB {{and a single}} broadcast feed of Radio 1 on TV platforms), the digital version of the station was not regionalised.|$|E
25|$|Not all {{children}} are of a similar aptitude level and may be skilled in different paradigms and fields. This has led to criticism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> examinations are conducted and the way a student is forced in the Indian community. The IIT-JEE format was restructured in 2006 following these complaints.|$|E
50|$|Coxeter {{states that}} every parallel-sided 2m-gon {{can be divided}} into m(m-1)/2 rhombs. For the dodecagon, m=6, and it {{can be divided into}} 15 rhombs, with one example shown below. This {{decomposition}} is based on a Petrie polygon projection of a 6-cube, with 15 <b>of</b> 240 faces.One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>the</b> mathematical manipulative pattern blocks are used is in creating a number of different dodecagons.|$|R
50|$|Frente Negra Brasileira (Black Brazilian Front), part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Black Movement <b>of</b> Brazil, was Brazil's first Black {{political}} party. Formed in 1931 {{and active}} until the November 10, 1937 suspension {{of political parties}} by the then president, Getúlio Vargas, the Frente mobilized Brazil's Afro-Descendant community for a project of racial equality. Desegregation campaigns and popular education focusing on literacy were just two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>the</b> Frente engaged in activism.|$|R

25|$|Research in 2003 by Professor Margaret Livingstone of Harvard University {{said that}} Mona Lisa's smile disappears when looked with direct vision, known as foveal. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> human eye {{processes}} visual information, {{it is less}} suited to pick up shadows directly; however, peripheral vision can pick up shadows well.|$|E
25|$|During the series, NHL President John Ziegler {{stated that}} Soviet players {{would never be}} able to join the NHL because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> Soviet hockey {{programme}} worked, and that NHLers {{would never be able}} to play in the Winter Olympics. Soviet players would be allowed to play in the NHL within three years, and an arrangement that would allow NHL players to play in the Olympics was announced within nine.|$|E
25|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> UV Index is calculated, it {{technically}} {{expresses the}} risk of developing sunburn, which is caused mostly by UVB radiation. However, UVA radiation also causes damage (photoaging, melanoma). Under some conditions, including most tanning beds which generate even higher UV intensities., the UVA level may be disproportionately higher than described by the UV Index. The use of broad-spectrum (UVA/UVB) sunscreen can help address this concern.|$|E
