5|$|Although the Poor Law Amendment Act did not ban {{all forms}} <b>of</b> <b>outdoor</b> relief, it stated that no able-bodied person was to receive money or other {{help from the}} Poor Law {{authorities}} except in a workhouse.

Workhouses were {{to be built in}} every parish and, if parishes were too small, parishes could group together to form Workhouse Unions.

5|$|Approximately 57,000 {{visitors}} come to {{the park}} each year for a variety <b>of</b> <b>outdoor</b> recreational activities. The 1978 final rule listing Novisuccinea chittenangoensis as threatened estimated that 60 percent of the habitat at Chittenango Falls was trampled by humans. Human disturbance also continues to threaten Novisuccinea chittenangoensis, although this has been greatly minimized by fencing of the snail's habitat area at Chittenango Falls. The current strategy for recovering Novisuccinea chittenangoensis includes buffering the species against extinction by perpetuating the extant population at Chittenango Falls at a baseline size, and new attempts in maintaining multiple captive populations.|$|E
5|$|As a {{resident}} of Switzerland, Prince Sadruddin {{was concerned about the}} impact of insensitive tourist development and deforestation on the European Alps. At the World Economic Forum in 1990, he launched Alp Action to protect the mountain ecosystem and preserve the Alps' cultural diversity and vitality. The Bellerive Foundation program encouraged eco-tourism, aiming to reduce the impact <b>of</b> <b>outdoor</b> adventure sports on the fragile alpine habitat. During its years of operation, Alp Action successfully launched over 140 projects in seven countries. It found inspiration in the system of national parks of the Canadian Rockies.|$|E

5|$|Designed without {{expansion}} joints, Time {{is one of}} a {{small number}} <b>of</b> <b>outdoor</b> sculptures made of reinforced pebble/concrete aggregate, few of which have been created since the 1930s. In 1936, Times weather-related cracks were repaired; further work occurred in 1955. The sculpture's subsequent repairs were followed by a rededication celebration in 1966. Although the sculpture received regular maintenance, early repair crews often did more harm than good, by using techniques such as sandblasting and patching cracks with rigid materials.|$|E
5|$|Nunavut {{features}} a number <b>of</b> <b>outdoor</b> adventure activity opportunities {{as a result}} of the territory's vast uninhabited area. Wildlife watching is one particularly popular activity - the territory is home to walrus and belugas, as well as eleven bird sanctuaries housing millions of birds. Muskox are also spread throughout Nunavut, although the territory's tourism authority does not promote 'muskox watching' trips specifically. The territory is also home to a population of polar bears, and trips designed to increase tourists' chances of spotting a polar bear are common. A number of private operators offer wildlife, bird, polar and whale watching tours, in addition to other activities.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the success}} of the Winter Classic and its predecessor, outdoor games have been held during {{subsequent}} seasons, and the Winter Classic has become an annual NHL tradition. The next Winter Classic was held on January 1, 2009, at Wrigley Field in Chicago, matching the Detroit Red Wings against the Chicago Blackhawks. Winter Classics have been held in every year since, except for 2013, which was interrupted by the 2012–2013 NHL lockout. Three Heritage Classics, one in 2011, one in 2014, and one in 2016 have been held since. The league expanded its offerings <b>of</b> <b>outdoor</b> games with the introduction of the NHL Stadium Series in 2014.

5|$|Each year, {{thousands}} <b>of</b> <b>outdoor</b> enthusiasts {{attempt to}} summit Mount Adams. The false summits and broad summit plateau have disheartened many climbers as this inscription {{on a rock}} at Piker’s Peak indicates. “You are a piker {{if you think this}} is the summit. Don’t crab, the mountain was here first.” Crampons and ice axes are needed on many routes because of glaciers and the route’s steepness. Aside from crevasses on the more difficult glacier routes, the biggest hazard is the loose rocks and boulders which are easily dislodged and a severe hazard for climbers below. These falling rocks are especially dangerous for climbers on the precipitous east faces and the steep headwalls of the north and west sides. Routes in those areas should only be climbed early in the season under as ideal conditions as can be had. Other hazards faced by climbers on Adams include sudden storms and clouds, avalanches, altitude sickness, and inexperience. Climbing Mount Adams can be dangerous {{for a variety of reasons}} and people have died in pursuit of the summit while many others have had close calls.|$|E
