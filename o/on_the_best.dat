5|$|English astrology {{had reached}} its zenith by the 17th century. Astrologers were theorists, researchers, and social engineers, {{as well as}} {{providing}} individual advice to everyone from monarchs downwards. Among other things, astrologers could advise <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> time to take a journey or harvest a crop, diagnose and prescribe for physical or mental illnesses, and predict natural disasters. This underpinned a system in which everything—people, the world, the universe—was understood to be interconnected, and astrology co-existed happily with religion, magic and science.|$|E

5|$|The {{battle of}} Bình Giã {{reflected}} the Viet Cong's growing military strength and influence, {{especially in the}} Mekong Delta region.

5|$|Despite his {{prominent}} {{position in}} the Nguyễn Dynasty, {{little is known about}} Phan's personal stance on Vietnamese relations with France, which {{was in the process of}} colonising Vietnam. France had first invaded in 1858, beginning the colonisation of southern Vietnam. Three provinces were ceded under the 1862 Treaty of Saigon, and a further three in 1867 to form the colony of Cochinchina. During the period, there was debate in the Huế court <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> strategy to regain the territory. One group advocated military means, while another believed in the use of diplomacy in addition to financial and religious concessions. By the time of Tự Đức's death in 1883, the whole of Vietnam was colonised, henceforth incorporated with Laos and Cambodia into French Indochina.|$|E
5|$|Fauré {{was elected}} to the Institut de France in 1909, after his {{father-in-law}} and Saint-Saëns, both long-established members, had canvassed strongly on his behalf. He won the ballot by a narrow margin, with 18 votes against 16 for the other candidate, Widor. In the same year a group of young composers led by Ravel and Koechlin broke with the Société Nationale de Musique, which under the presidency of Vincent d'Indy had become a reactionary organisation, and formed a new group, the Société Musicale Indépendante. While Fauré accepted the presidency of this society, he also remained a member of the older one and continued <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> of terms with d'Indy; his sole concern was the fostering of new music. In 1911 he oversaw the Conservatoire's move to new premises in the rue de Madrid. During this time, Fauré developed serious problems with his hearing. Not only did he start to go deaf, but sounds became distorted, so that high and low notes sounded painfully out of tune to him.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the political unrest in Saigon, the Communist leadership in North Vietnam were far {{more concerned about the}} best strategy to fight the South Vietnamese government and their American supporters. While all leaders in Hanoi shared the same goal of eventual reunification of their homeland, different factions within the Communist Party disagreed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> method to achieve their desired goal. Members of North Vietnam's Politburo were divided by the issues surrounding the Soviet strategy of peaceful co-existence versus the Chinese strategy of supporting national liberation movements in emerging countries. Despite their differences of opinion, the Communist Party leadership ultimately made preparations for armed struggle in South Vietnam. From Hanoi's perspective, the military regime in Saigon was able to hold out because the Communist main forces were still not ready to fight a conventional war, so North Vietnam must focus on the development of its military force in the shortest period of time. In the meantime, however, the war must be kept at its current level in order to prevent the full involvement of the United States military.|$|E
5|$|In early 1810, as the cyclone season {{came to an}} end, Hamelin {{ordered a}} {{squadron}} of frigates under Captain Guy-Victor Duperré to attack British convoys in the Bay of Bengal. Duperré was initially unsuccessful, but after sailing to Madagascar for a brief refit he encountered and defeated a convoy in the Action of 3 July 1810. The British response to the French depredations was already in progress: in late June, Rowley sailed with two frigates to Rodriguez, leaving Captain Samuel Pym off Isle de France with the remainder. On Rodriguez, Rowley and Lieutenant Colonel Henry Keating conferred <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> method of invading and rapidly subduing the island, determining that the best plan was to land soldiers {{either side of the}} island's capital Saint Denis and defeat the garrison outside the town, forcing the new governor to surrender.|$|E

But Walter Pollack, Morris Ernst, and other leaders felt that Supreme Court decisions were the best path to guarantee civil liberties. A series of Supreme Court decisions in the 1920s foretold a changing national atmosphere; anti-radical emotions were diminishing, {{and there was a}} growing willingness to protect freedom of speech and assembly via court decisions.|$|E

5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} as Clavaria kunzei by pioneer mycologist Elias Magnus Fries in 1821. E.J.H.

In general, coral fungi often have extensive taxonomic histories, as mycologists have not agreed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> way to classify them. In addition to Clavaria and Ramariopsis, the R.kunzei has been placed in the genera Ramaria by Lucien Quélet in 1888, and Clavulinopsis by Walter Jülich in 1985. According to the taxonomic database MycoBank, the species has acquired a sizable list of synonyms, listed in the taxobox.

5|$|The year of 1964 {{marked a}} decisive {{turning point in}} the Vietnam War. Following the ousting of President Ngô Đình Diệm in 1963, South Vietnam's top army generals {{continued}} to vie with each other for control of the country’s military-dominated government instead of combating the emerging forces of the National Liberation Front, also known as the Viet Cong. The fragility of the South Vietnamese government was reflected on the battlefield, where its military experienced great setbacks against the Viet Cong. Taking advantage of Saigon's political instability, Communist leaders in Hanoi began preparing for war. Even though key members of North Vietnam's Politburo disagreed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> strategy to reunite their country, they ultimately went ahead to prepare for armed struggle against South Vietnam and their American supporters.|$|E

After Mary Stuart's flight into England (1568) Leicester was, unlike Cecil, in favour of restoring her as Scottish queen under English control, preferably with a Protestant English husband, such as the Duke of Norfolk. In 1577 Leicester had a personal meeting with Mary and listened to her complaints about her captivity. By the early 1580s Mary had come to fear Leicester's influence with James VI, her son, in whose privy chamber the English Earl had placed a spy. She spread stories about his supposed lust for the English throne, and when the Catholic anti-Leicester libel, Leicester's Commonwealth, was published in 1584 Dudley believed that Mary was involved in its conception.|$|E
