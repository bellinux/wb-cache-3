He oversaw the league's course <b>of</b> <b>direction</b> through two player strikes, and the modern league's financial stability is in great part due to his leadership. He held influence for over a decade, before stepping back due to criticism of what other owners saw as his overly-secretive ways.|$|E
40|$|There are {{sequences}} <b>of</b> <b>directions</b> such that, {{given any}} compact set K in R^n, {{the sequence of}} iterated Steiner symmetrals of K in these directions converges to a ball. However examples show that Steiner symmetrization along a sequence <b>of</b> <b>directions</b> whose differences are square summable does not generally converge. (Note that this may happen even with sequences <b>of</b> <b>directions</b> which are dense in S^{n- 1 }.) Here we show that such sequences converge in shape. The limit need not be an ellipsoid or even a convex set. We also deal with uniformly distributed sequences <b>of</b> <b>directions,</b> and with a recent result of Klain on Steiner symmetrization along sequences chosen from a finite set <b>of</b> <b>directions.</b> Comment: 11 page...|$|R
40|$|To each totally disconnected, locally compact {{topological group}} G and each group A of automorphisms of G, a pseudo-metric space of "directions" has been {{associated}} by U. Baumgartner and the second author. Given a Lie group G over a local field, it is a natural idea to try to define a map from the space <b>of</b> <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> analytic automorphisms of G to the space <b>of</b> <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> automorphisms of the Lie algebra L(G) of G, which takes the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> an analytic automorphism of G to the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the associated Lie algebra automorphism. We show that, in general, this map is not well-defined. However, the pathology cannot occur for a large class of linear algebraic groups (called "generalized Cayley groups" here). For such groups, the assignment just proposed defines a well-defined isometric embedding from the space <b>of</b> <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> inner automorphisms of G to the space <b>of</b> <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> automorphisms of L(G). Some counterexamples concerning the existence of small joint tidy subgroups for flat groups of automorphisms are also provided...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} visibility {{representations of}} graphs {{in which the}} vertices are presented by a collection O of non-overlapping convex regions on the plane. Two points x and y are visible if the straight-line segment xy is not obstructed by any object. Two objects A, B ∈ O are called visible if there exist points x ∈ A,y ∈ B such that x is visible from y. We consider visibility only for a finite set <b>of</b> <b>directions.</b> In such a representation, the given graph is decomposed into a union of inidirectional visibility graphs, for the chosen set <b>of</b> <b>directions.</b> This raises the problem of studying the number <b>of</b> <b>directions</b> needed to represent a given graph.

For the Moon–Earth system, this effect has been measured with the help of lunar laser ranging. More recently, it has been measured for test masses aboard the satellite Gravity Probe B to a precision of better than 0.3%.|$|E

5|$|The {{noble gases}} are nearly ideal gases under {{standard}} conditions, but their {{deviations from the}} ideal gas law provided important clues {{for the study of}} intermolecular interactions. The Lennard-Jones potential, often used to model intermolecular interactions, was deduced in 1924 by John Lennard-Jones from experimental data on argon before the development of quantum mechanics provided the tools for understanding intermolecular forces from first principles. The theoretical analysis of these interactions became tractable because the noble gases are monatomic and the atoms spherical, which means that the interaction between the atoms is independent <b>of</b> <b>direction,</b> or isotropic.|$|E

5|$|After visiting England in July 1936, Thomas Finucane, then {{a company}} director, decided {{to set up}} an office in the West End of London on Regent Street. In November 1936, the family moved to England {{permanently}} and bought a house at 26 Castle Gate Road, Richmond in the London suburbs. Brendan was sent to Cardinal Vaughan Memorial School. Brendan completed his schooling with good qualifications. He started in an office job as an accountant which he loathed. In 1937, the RAF began offering short-service commissions (SSC) to lower-class persons who met the academic standard. It offered a four-year term as a junior rank on squadron service with flying lessons. A further six years would be spent on the reserve list. In November 1937, Brendan approached his father about joining the British Armed Forces. Despite his Republican past, the senior Finucane agreed believing a military career would provide him a sense <b>of</b> <b>direction</b> lacking in his own youth. His parents cashed in their insurance policies, even though they needed the money and Thomas Andrew Finucane had been made unemployed.|$|E
5|$|American {{astronomer}} Edwin Hubble {{observed that}} the distances to faraway galaxies were strongly correlated with their redshifts. This was interpreted to mean that all distant galaxies and clusters are receding away from our vantage point with an apparent velocity proportional to their distance: that is, the farther they are, the faster they move away from us, regardless <b>of</b> <b>direction.</b> Assuming the Copernican principle (that the Earth is not {{the center of the}} universe), the only remaining interpretation is that all observable regions of the universe are receding from all others. Since we know that the distance between galaxies increases today, it must mean that in the past galaxies were closer together. The continuous expansion of the universe implies that the universe was denser and hotter in the past.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the release}} of Episode I in 2002, the Xenosaga project was reevaluated and staff reshuffled to allow newer staff members a chance to handle the series. Series creator and Monolith Soft co-founder Tetsuya Takahashi stepped down as director, taking on other {{responsibilities}} within the company {{in addition to being}} given wider creative input on projects. Takahashi's explanation was {{that he did not want}} to limit the scope and direction of the Xenosaga series, and that his style <b>of</b> <b>direction</b> as seen for Episode I could result in the development period becoming extended exponentially. During this period the Xenosaga series, originally planned by Takahashi as a six-part series, was rearranged into a trilogy, with the possibility of further episodes should the series meet continued success. The new director was Koh Arai, while Tomohiro Hagiwara became lead producer, both of whom had worked on Episode I in minor roles; Takahashi on an executive role overseeing Episode II, in addition to keeping the staff informed with the lore of Xenosaga.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, Chéreau staged Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen at the Bayreuth Festival to {{celebrate}} the festival's centenary, termed the Jahrhundertring. The production, celebrating 100 years after Wagner's work had been performed {{for the first time}} as a cycle at the first Bayreuth Festival, became known as the Jahrhundertring (Centenary Ring). Chéreau collaborated with conductor Pierre Boulez, who had recommended him to the festival direction. The French team revolutionised the understanding of Wagner in Germany, as music critic Eleonore Büning wrote in her obituary in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. Chéreau set the scene in the time of the composition, with a critical view of the time's capitalism, industrialism and spiritual background. As Büning and others pointed out, the staging left a standard for productions of the Ring Cycle to follow. Gerhard R. Koch mentioned in his obituary that the unity <b>of</b> <b>direction,</b> scene and light was new for Bayreuth and suggested a critical view on capitalism heading towards fascism.|$|E
5|$|In cold, wet weather, the 3rd Guards Brigade made a short advance {{behind a}} ragged barrage, took the higher {{ground on the}} edge of Houthoulst Forest and cut off the rest of the spur running {{north-east}} from Veldhoek. Contact with the 17th Division on the right flank was lost, after the left flank formation of the 17th Division veered south and the crew of a contact patrol aircraft observing the advance, failed to see the loss <b>of</b> <b>direction.</b> Two platoons detailed to meet the attacking brigade of the 17th Division, had to dig in near the Angle Point pillbox under machine-gun fire. After dark, the Guards and the 17th Division closed the gap, by capturing the blockhouses at Angle Point and Aden House. Next day, conditions were so bad that the attacking brigade was relieved by the 1st Guards Brigade. The fresh troops patrolled vigorously to the southern edge of Houthoulst Forest, against little organised German resistance, except for extensive sniping around the Colbert cross-roads and Colombo House.|$|E

5|$|In {{his early}} career, {{he played in}} a variety of attacking positions. Although he usually {{operated}} inside the penalty area as a main striker or centre-forward, his wide range of skills also allowed him to play in a more withdrawn role, as an inside forward or second striker, or out wide. In his later career, he took on more of a deeper playmaking role behind the strikers, often functioning as an attacking midfielder. Pelé’s unique playing style combined speed, creativity, and technical skill with physical power, stamina, and athleticism. His excellent technique, balance, flair, agility, and dribbling skills enabled him to beat opponents with the ball, and frequently saw him use sudden changes <b>of</b> <b>direction</b> and elaborate feints in order to get past players, such as his trademark move, the drible da vaca.
