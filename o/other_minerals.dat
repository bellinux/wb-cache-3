5|$|In some select cases, {{pipelines}} {{can even}} transport solids, such as coal and <b>other</b> <b>minerals,</b> over long distances; short distance {{transportation of goods}} such as grain, cement, concrete, solid wastes, pulp etc. is also feasible.|$|E
5|$|Coal and <b>other</b> <b>minerals</b> were {{extracted}} in {{the west}} of Scotland from medieval times; getting the heavy product to market was always a challenge, and this encouraged the development of tracked systems; the earliest plateways {{in the vicinity of}} Ayr date from—at the latest—1775.|$|E
5|$|Current {{research}} suggests that the primary method of infection in animals is through ingestion. It is thought that prions may be deposited in the environment through the remains of dead animals and via urine, saliva, and other body fluids. They may then linger in the soil by binding to clay and <b>other</b> <b>minerals.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Other</b> <b>mineral</b> {{commodities}} {{produced in}} the country are natural gas, petroleum, salt, and silver.|$|R
50|$|Agriculture is a {{main part}} of the economy, and the state also has coal, steel and <b>other</b> <b>mineral</b> industries.|$|R

5|$|Geothermal {{activity}} and the emission of volcanic gases are ongoing, and the volcano has been prospected {{for the possibility of}} obtaining geothermal energy. The geothermal activity has resulted in widespread rock alteration and the formation of sulfur deposits, which were mentioned in a 1909 report and later mined. Koh-i-Sultan also has deposits of <b>other</b> <b>minerals.</b>|$|E
5|$|Other source {{minerals}} for zinc include smithsonite (zinc carbonate), hemimorphite (zinc silicate), wurtzite (another zinc sulfide), {{and sometimes}} hydrozincite (basic zinc carbonate). With {{the exception of}} wurtzite, all these <b>other</b> <b>minerals</b> were formed by weathering of the primordial zinc sulfides.|$|E
5|$|Although coal, hydrocarbons, iron ore, platinum, copper, chromium, nickel, {{gold and}} <b>other</b> <b>minerals</b> have been found, {{they have not}} been in large enough {{quantities}} to exploit. The 1991 Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty also restricts a struggle for resources. In 1998, a compromise agreement was reached to place an indefinite ban on mining, to be reviewed in 2048, further limiting economic development and exploitation. The primary economic activity is the capture and offshore trading of fish. Antarctic fisheries in 2000–01 reported landing 112,934tonnes.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to their high biodiversity, abyssal plains are of great current and future commercial and strategic interest. For example, they {{may be used for}} the legal and illegal disposal of large structures such as ships and oil rigs, radioactive waste and other hazardous waste, such as munitions. They may also be attractive sites for deep-sea fishing, and extraction of oil and gas and <b>other</b> <b>minerals.</b> Future deep-sea waste disposal activities that could be significant by 2025 include emplacement of sewage and sludge, carbon-dioxide sequestration, and disposal of dredge spoils.|$|E
5|$|More than 20 <b>other</b> <b>minerals</b> {{have higher}} {{dispersion}} (that is difference in refractive index for {{blue and red}} light) than diamond, such as titanite 0.051, andradite 0.057, cassiterite 0.071, strontium titanate 0.109, sphalerite 0.156, synthetic rutile 0.330, cinnabar 0.4, etc. (see dispersion). However, the combination of dispersion with extreme hardness, wear and chemical resistivity, as well as clever marketing, determines the exceptional value of diamond as a gemstone.|$|E
5|$|Only a {{very small}} {{fraction}} of the diamond ore consists of actual diamonds. The ore is crushed, during which care is required not to destroy larger diamonds, and then sorted by density. Today, diamonds are located in the diamond-rich density fraction with the help of X-ray fluorescence, after which the final sorting steps are done by hand. Before the use of X-rays became commonplace, the separation was done with grease belts; diamonds have a stronger tendency to stick to grease than the <b>other</b> <b>minerals</b> in the ore.|$|E
50|$|A related {{phenomenon}} is {{the formation of}} pleochroic halos surrounding minute zircon inclusions within a crystal of biotite or <b>other</b> <b>mineral.</b> The spherical halos are produced by alpha particle radiation from the included uranium- or thorium-bearing species. Such halos can also found surrounding monazite and <b>other</b> radioactive <b>minerals.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Other</b> <b>mineral</b> lines now became {{dominant}} in the area, and the Carmarthenshire Railway ceased {{to play an important}} role in the traffic.|$|R
50|$|Rusakov {{discovered}} the following mining fields: Kounrad (copper), Semizbugskoe (corundum, andalusite) Karagaylinskoye (lead, barite), Kairaktinsky (asbestos, barite, base metals) and <b>other</b> <b>mineral</b> deposits.|$|R
5|$|Pliny {{returns to}} the problem of fraud and the {{detection}} of false gems using several tests, including the scratch test, where counterfeit gems can be marked by a steel file, and genuine ones not. Perhaps it refers to glass imitations of jewellery gemstones. He refers to using one hard mineral to scratch another, presaging the Mohs hardness scale. Diamond sits {{at the top of the}} series because, Pliny says, it will scratch all <b>other</b> <b>minerals.</b>|$|E
5|$|Selenium {{interacts with}} other nutrients, such as iodine and vitamin E. The effect of {{selenium}} deficiency on health remains uncertain, particularly {{in relation to}} Kashin-Beck disease. Also, selenium interacts with <b>other</b> <b>minerals,</b> such as zinc and copper. High doses of Se supplements in pregnant animals might disturb the Zn:Cu ratio and lead to Zn reduction; in such treatment cases, Zn levels should be monitored. Further {{studies are needed to}} conﬁrm these interactions.|$|E
5|$|The {{abundance}} of actinium in the Earth's crust {{is only about}} 5%. Actinium is mostly present in uranium-containing, but also in <b>other</b> <b>minerals,</b> though in much smaller quantities. The content of actinium in most natural objects corresponds to the isotopic equilibrium of parent isotope 235U, {{and it is not}} affected by the weak Ac migration. Protactinium is more abundant (10−12%) in the Earth's crust than actinium. It was discovered in the uranium ore in 1913 by Fajans and Göhring. As actinium, the distribution of protactinium follows that of 235U.|$|E
25|$|Magnesium chloride, {{magnesium}} sulfate and <b>other</b> <b>mineral</b> salts {{are present in}} the Upper Permian Basin and in the underlying playas of the High Plains.|$|R
50|$|Because of high costs, the {{development}} of petroleum, phosphate, and <b>other</b> <b>mineral</b> resources is not a near-term prospect. It produces 400,000 barrels/day of petrol.|$|R

5|$|A band of Middle Devonian {{limestone}} runs west to {{east from}} Cremyll to Plymstock including the Hoe. Local limestone {{may be seen in}} numerous buildings, walls and pavements throughout Plymouth. To the north and north east of the city is the granite mass of Dartmoor; the granite was mined and exported via Plymouth. Rocks brought down the Tamar from Dartmoor include ores containing tin, copper, tungsten, lead and <b>other</b> <b>minerals.</b> There is evidence that the middle Devonian limestone belt at the south edge of Plymouth and in Plymstock was quarried at West Hoe, Cattedown and Radford.|$|E
5|$|A third {{possibility}} is {{the involvement of}} a third body or a type of impact disruption. More-recent lines of evidence for Phobos having a highly porous interior, and suggesting a composition containing mainly phyllosilicates and <b>other</b> <b>minerals</b> known from Mars, point toward an origin of Phobos from material ejected by an impact on Mars that reaccreted in Martian orbit, similar to the prevailing theory for the origin of Earth's moon. Although the VNIR spectra of the moons of Mars resemble those of outer-belt asteroids, the thermal infrared spectra of Phobos are reported to be inconsistent with chondrites of any class.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{butterflies}} consume only liquids, ingested {{through the}} proboscis. They sip water from damp patches for hydration and feed on nectar from flowers, {{from which they}} obtain sugars for energy, and sodium and <b>other</b> <b>minerals</b> vital for reproduction. Several species of butterflies need more sodium than that provided by nectar and are attracted by sodium in salt; they sometimes land on people, attracted by the salt in human sweat. Some butterflies also visit dung, rotting fruit or carcasses to obtain minerals and nutrients. In many species, this mud-puddling behaviour is restricted to the males, and {{studies have suggested that}} the nutrients collected may be provided as a nuptial gift, along with the spermatophore, during mating.|$|E

5|$|Evidence {{from the}} Apollo 17 mission {{shows that the}} massifs {{surrounding}} the valley are composed primarily of feldspar-rich breccia and that basalt underlies the valley floor, {{a result of the}} lava flows during the valley's history. Seismic studies suggest that the basalt below the valley floor is about 1400 metres (4593.2feet) thick. Above the layer of subfloor basalt lies a deposit of unconsolidated material of various compositions ranging from volcanic material to impact-formed regolith. The valley floor's unusually low albedo, or reflectivity, {{is a direct result of}} the volcanic material and glass beads located there. The deeper craters on the valley floor act as 'natural drill holes' and allowed the astronauts to sample the subfloor basalt. These basalt samples are composed primarily of plagioclase, but also contain amounts of clinopyroxene and <b>other</b> <b>minerals.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2009, a {{group of}} {{scientists}} from the CRISM team reported on 9 to 10 different classes of minerals formed in the presence of water. Different types of clays (also called phyllosilicates) were found in many locations. The physilicates identified included aluminum smectite, iron/magnesium smectite, kaolinite, prehnite, and chlorite. Rocks containing carbonate were found around the Isidis basin. Carbonates belong to one class in which life could have developed. Areas around Valles Marineris were found to contain hydrated silica and hydrated sulfates. The researchers identified hydrated sulfates and ferric minerals in Terra Meridiani and in Valles Marineris. <b>Other</b> <b>minerals</b> found on Mars were jarosite, alunite, hematite, opal, and gypsum. Two to five of the mineral classes were formed with the right pH and sufficient water to permit life to grow.|$|E
5|$|Ironstone {{outcrops}} {{along the}} northern edge of the South Wales Coalfield were extensively worked for the production of iron and were important in the initiation of the Industrial Revolution in South Wales. Lead was mined at Pentre Halkyn in Flintshire during the Roman occupation of Britain and there were ore-bearing sites in Clwyd where lead, silver and sometimes zinc were mined. These metals were also mined in the upland areas of the Rivers Ystwyth and Rheidol. Manganese, titanium and numerous <b>other</b> <b>minerals</b> occur in various parts of Wales. Gold is found in southern Snowdonia and at Dolaucothi, and Snowdonia had a flourishing copper industry from the early 1800s. Although exploited in the past, none of these minerals is mined on a commercial scale today.|$|E
