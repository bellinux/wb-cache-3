50|$|Viscosity {{modifiers}} make an <b>oil's</b> <b>viscosity</b> higher at elevated temperatures, improving its {{viscosity index}} (VI).

5000|$|The SAE has a {{separate}} viscosity rating system for gear, axle, and manual transmission oils, SAE J306, which {{should not be}} confused with engine <b>oil</b> <b>viscosity.</b> The higher numbers of a gear oil (e.g., 75W-140) do not mean that it has higher viscosity than an engine oil. In anticipation of new lower engine <b>oil</b> <b>viscosity</b> grades, to avoid confusion with the [...] "winter" [...] grades of oil the SAE adopted SAE 16 as a standard to follow SAE 20 instead of SAE 15. Regarding the change Michael Covitch of Lubrizol, Chair of the SAE International Engine <b>Oil</b> <b>Viscosity</b> Classification (EOVC) task force was quoted stating [...] "If we continued to count down from SAE 20 to 15 to 10, etc., we would be facing continuing customer confusion problems with popular low-temperature viscosity grades such as SAE 10W, SAE 5W, and SAE 0W," [...] he noted. [...] "By choosing to call the new viscosity grade SAE 16, we established a precedent for future grades, counting down by fours instead of fives: SAE 12, SAE 8, SAE 4." ...|$|E

30|$|The rate of oil {{resistance}} against flowing is called viscosity, {{which is one}} of the most important factors for selecting suitable oil for an apparatus. Because of the extra importance of viscosity for a lubricant, in the present research, we have focused our attention on surveying the produced changes in the engine <b>oil's</b> <b>viscosity</b> which is the result of adding CuO nanoparticles.|$|R

The <b>oil</b> <b>viscosities</b> spanned four orders of magnitude (3  ≤ μ o ≤  2.1  ×  104 Pa s).

5000|$|A 1989 American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) report {{stated that}} its 12-year effort {{to come up}} with a new high-temperature, high-shear (HTHS) {{standard}} was not successful. Referring to SAE J300, the basis for current grading standards, the report stated:The rapid growth of non-Newtonian multigraded oils has rendered kinematic viscosity as a nearly useless parameter for characterising [...] "real" [...] viscosity in critical zones of an engine... There are those who are disappointed that the twelve-year effort has not resulted in a redefinition of the SAE J300 Engine <b>Oil</b> <b>Viscosity</b> Classification document so as to express high-temperature viscosity of the various grades ...

30|$|The oil holdups and {{standstill}} periods do {{not appear}} to have a great influence on the pressure drop evolution. However, the <b>oil</b> <b>viscosities</b> and superficial velocities of the cleaning water seem to significantly affect the pressure drops at the inception of the cleaning process.

Viscometer measures the actual viscosity of the fuel, this value is compared with the set point in the controller and the command is sent to the heater to adjust the temperature of the fuel.|$|R
30|$|Based on {{the above}} literature, {{it can be}} {{predicted}} that the oil mobilization enhances with increasing ultrasound power.

40|$|International audienceTo {{simulate}} ionic species {{release from}} hydrolysis reactions when bitumen emulsions {{come into contact}} with gravel, electrolyte solutions have been added to cationic emulsions and their impact on emulsions stability has been tested. In order to understand how the different parameters (<b>oils</b> <b>viscosity,</b> <b>oils</b> and electrolytes nature) influence the emulsion destabilisation, which included a gelation process, different materials have been used: two bitumen from different origins as well as two silicone <b>oils</b> with different <b>viscosities,</b> acting as model oils to simplify the system. According to cationic emulsifier, a quaternary ammonium salt was used. The different emulsions have been studied. Macroscopic and microscopic observations as well as size distribution measurements have been performed to evaluate the emulsion destabilisation. Results obtained show relationships between emulsion formulation and destabilisation evolution (gelation process included) of the materials studied. Phenomena observed could be interpreted by well-known mechanisms such as flocculation and coalescence. Moreover, it will be discussed how the coalescence and relaxation shape kinetics, probably due to salt and emulsion formulation, affect the gelation phenomenon...|$|R

The analysis shows good agreement with published data. Large diameter and fine-pitched gears had higher peak efficiencies but lower part-load efficiency.

There were prepared blends of new and used engine oil without and with oil additive in specific ratio according manufacturer’s recommendations. Dynamic viscosity of blends with additive was compared with pure new and pure used engine oil. The temperature dependence dynamic viscosity of samples was evaluated by using rotary viscometer with standard spindle. Concern was that the oil additive can moves engine <b>oil</b> of several <b>viscosity</b> grades up. It is able to lead to failure in the engine. Mathematical models were used for fitting experimental values of dynamic viscosity. Exponential fit function was selected, which was very accurate because the coefficient of determination R 2 achieved high values (0. 98 – 0. 99). These models are able to predict viscosity behaviour blends of engine oil and additive...|$|R
50|$|Motor oil, engine oil, or engine {{lubricant}} is any {{of various}} substances comprising base oils enhanced with additives, particularly antiwear additive plus detergents, dispersants and, for multi-grade <b>oils</b> <b>viscosity</b> index improvers. In addition to that, almost all lubricating oils contain corrosion (GB: rust) and oxidation inhibitors. Motor oil {{is used for}} lubrication of internal combustion engines. The main function of motor oil is to reduce friction and wear on moving parts and to clean the engine from sludge (one of the functions of dispersants) and varnish (detergents). It also neutralizes acids that originate from fuel and from oxidation of the lubricant (detergents), improves sealing of piston rings, and cools the engine by carrying heat away from moving parts.|$|R
