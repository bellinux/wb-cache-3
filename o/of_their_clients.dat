5|$|In July 1889, the Metropolitan Police {{uncovered}} a male brothel operated by Charles Hammond in London's Cleveland Street. Under police interrogation, the male prostitutes and pimps revealed the names <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>clients,</b> who included Lord Arthur Somerset, an Extra Equerry to the Prince of Wales. At the time, all homosexual acts between men were illegal, and the clients faced social ostracism, prosecution, and at worst, two years' imprisonment with hard labour.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, reform {{movements}} in the U.S. (the so-called Progressive movement) made most forms of gambling illegal in most communities. Gambling continued illegally in many places, though, creating new opportunities for criminal enterprises. The 18th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, ratified in 1919, outlawed the manufacture, transportation, importation, and sale of alcoholic beverages and initiated the Prohibition era. The new law was widely unpopular, and bootlegging became rampant. Galveston's already lax social attitudes allowed this, as well as brothels and other illegal businesses, to blossom in the city. These institutions were so accepted that at one point, the city required health inspections for prostitutes {{to ensure the safety}} <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>clients.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the 17th century, many architects {{studying}} in Italy learned of Palladio's work. Foreign architects then returned home and adapted Palladio's style to suit various climates, topographies and personal tastes <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>clients.</b> Isolated forms of Palladianism {{throughout the world}} were brought about in this way. However, the Palladian style did not reach the zenith of its popularity until the 18th century, primarily in England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland and later North America. In Venice itself there was an early reaction to the excesses of Baroque architecture that manifested itself as a return to Palladian principles. The earliest neo-Palladians there were the exact contemporaries, both trained up as masons, Domenico Rossi (1657–1737) and Andrea Tirali (1657–1737). Tommaso Temanza, their biographer, {{proved to be the}} movement's most able and learned proponent; in his hands the visual inheritance of Palladio's example became increasingly codified in correct rules and drifted towards neoclassicism.|$|E

5|$|Many {{executives}} at Enron were indicted {{for a variety}} of charges and some were later sentenced to prison. Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen, was found guilty in a United States District Court of illegally destroying documents relevant to the SEC investigation which voided its license to audit public companies, effectively closing the business. By the time the ruling was overturned at the U.S. Supreme Court, the company had lost the majority of its customers and had ceased operating. Enron employees and shareholders received limited returns in lawsuits, despite losing billions in pensions and stock prices. As a consequence of the scandal, new regulations and legislation were enacted to expand the accuracy of financial reporting for public companies. One piece of legislation, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, increased penalties for destroying, altering, or fabricating records in federal investigations or for attempting to defraud shareholders. The act also increased the accountability of auditing firms to remain unbiased and independent <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>clients.</b>|$|E

25|$|On a {{professional}} level many use educational or occupational titles such as Architect, Engineer, Doctor, Attorney (often abbreviated as Arch./Archt./Ar., Engr., Dr. , and Atty. respectively), even on an informal or social level. Despite this, some <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>clients</b> (especially non-Filipinos) would address them as simply Mr. or Mrs./Ms. followed by their surnames (or even Sir/Ma'am) in conversation. It is very rare, however, for a Filipino (especially those born and educated abroad) to address Filipino architects, engineers, and lawyers, even mentioning and referring to their names, the non-Philippine (i.e. standard) English way. As mentioned before, this is prevalent in TV and film depictions.|$|E
25|$|GDLN {{clients are}} {{typically}} NGOs, government, {{private sector and}} development agencies who find that they work better together on subregional, regional or global development issues using the facilities and tools offered by GDLN Affiliates. Clients also benefit from the ability of Affiliates to help them choose and apply these tools effectively, and to tap development practitioners and experts worldwide. GDLN Affiliates facilitate around 1000 videoconference-based activities a year on behalf <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>clients,</b> reaching some 90,000 people worldwide. Most of these activities bring together participants in two or more countries over a series of sessions. A majority of GDLN activities are organized by small government agencies and NGOs.|$|E
25|$|Investors may not {{be members}} of stock exchanges. Rather they must buy and sell {{securities}} through broker-dealers which are registered with the appropriate regulatory body for that purpose. In accepting investors as clients, broker-dealers take on the risks <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>clients</b> {{not being able to}} meet their financial obligations. Hence retail (individual) investors generally are required to keep their investment assets in custody with the broker-dealer through which they buy and sell securities. A broker-dealer would normally not accept an order to buy from a retail clients unless there is sufficient cash on deposit with the broker-dealer {{to cover the cost of}} the order, nor sell unless the client already has the security in the broker-dealer's custody.|$|E

25|$|According to the National Alliance to End Homelessness, {{outreach}} {{services to}} help sexually exploited youth {{should focus on}} the locations where they congregate and are approached by pimps for exploitation, including public spaces such as malls and schools, and the internet. Outreach workers need to develop a close professional relationship with law enforcement to learn about trends and locations, but should carefully avoid compromising their independence or the confidentiality <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>clients.</b> Local law enforcement should target pimps and customers (janes or johns) and not the victims (youth and young adult prostitutes) for prosecution to be effective. Partnerships between nonprofit programs and law enforcement can help offer survival sex worker victims community-based services and housing when they are picked up by police officers.|$|E
25|$|Barrett had a {{tremendous}} impact on the developing field of social work and on services for women and children. Under her leadership, the NFCM became an established social service organization that provided a wide spectrum of services to women. The mission initiated activities that many now consider essential services for women and children. Florence Crittenton homes pioneered women-oriented policies in the areas of health care, employment for women, and children's rights. The organization campaigned for equality for women and for recognition of women's needs... Despite differences in class and race with most <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>clients,</b> FC volunteers tried to emphasize gender identity....

25|$|One topic {{covered in}} this section {{describes}} the responsibility art therapist have to their patients (ATCB 2005). According to the ATCB, art therapists must strive to advance the wellness <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>clients,</b> respect {{the rights of the}} client, and make sure they are providing a useful service (2005). They cannot discriminate against patient whatsoever, and may never desert or neglect patients receiving therapy. Art therapist must fully explain to their patients what their expectations of the patients will be {{at the outset of the}} professional relationship between the two. Art therapists should continue therapy with a patient only if the client is benefiting from the therapy. It's against the principles established by the ATCB for art therapist to have patients only for financial reasons.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} this method is based on Sitaras' initial {{experience}} as a fitness trainer, especially concerning {{the lack of a}} scientific approach in this field, the usual trainer has available only an empirical knowledge of a client's body status. He found necessary an initial evaluation, similar to a hospital general medical examination giving detailed examination and subsequently providing proper treatment. He further envisaged an evaluation tailored on fitness goals that could give detailed insights and help the trainer analyze the physical status <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>clients</b> for a sufficient time. This would permit to investigate what is needed by understanding better the particular case of each individual. The location and the severity of the damages or inflammations on muscles and tendons also differ between people, meaning that the required exercises should be differed.|$|E
25|$|Such was the {{impression}} of Lever’s demeanour and testimony on the defence team that, {{as soon as the}} court was assembled on the following day, they capitulated completely. They also stated that, on behalf <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>clients</b> that they wished to retract completely “every imputation made upon Mr Lever's honour and integrity” and express their deepest regrets for having made such malicious attacks upon him. There followed a scene {{on the floor of the}} court wherein the legal teams literally haggled over the size of the financial settlement. In the end, the sum agreed to was fifty-thousand pounds, plus around forty-thousand which was eventually awarded from individual newspapers. This victory was celebrated with a day’s holiday at Port Sunlight, where Lever blithely addressed the employees and other spectators who cheered and applauded their hero.|$|E
25|$|From 40 in 1964, {{the press}} corps in South Vietnam had grown to 282 by January 1966. By August that number had jumped to 419.

Correspondents with valid accreditations had to show their credentials in order to receive a card that gave them access to military transportation and facilities. All other correspondents had to present a letter from their editors stating that they represented a bona-fide news-gathering organization which would take responsibility for their conduct.
