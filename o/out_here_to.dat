500|$|Nickelodeon officially {{announced}} the episode on {{a press release}} on April 5, 2010. According to the network, [...] "SpongeBob and Patrick learn the 'Shelly Super Highway' is coming to Bikini Bottom - right through Jellyfish Fields! They {{must find a way}} to galvanize their neighbors, or it could be the end for Jellyfish Fields forever." [...] It was promoted as SpongeBob's campaign to save the jellyfish. Writer Banks told that the episode never set out to teach environmental lessons. He said [...] "When you entertain someone and make it funny, sometimes you can get a message across [...] Not that we're <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> send messages everywhere." [...] The episode featured two musical numbers, including [...] "Give Jellyfish Fields a Chance", a salute to the 1960s protest songs [...] with similarities to John Lennon's [...] "Give Peace a Chance". Banks, on the song, said that [...] " [...] sort of Bob Dylan meets John Lennon." ...|$|E

500|$|For {{the first}} couple of months, they were merely [...] "killing time", {{according}} to Robertson, with many early sessions devoted to covers. [...] "With the covers Bob was educating us a little", recalls Robertson. [...] "The whole folkie thing was still very questionable to us—it wasn't the train we came in on. ... He'd come up with something like 'Royal Canal', and you'd say, 'This is so beautiful! The expression!' ... He remembered too much, remembered too many songs too well. He'd come over to Big Pink, or wherever we were, and pull out some old song—and he'd prepped for this. He'd practiced this, and then come <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> <b>to</b> show us." [...] Songs recorded at the early sessions included material written or made popular by Johnny Cash, Ian & Sylvia, John Lee Hooker, Hank Williams and Eric Von Schmidt, as well as traditional songs and standards. Linking all the recordings, both new material and old, {{is the way in which}} Dylan re-engaged with traditional American music. Biographer Barney Hoskyns observed that both the seclusion of Woodstock and the discipline and sense of tradition in The Hawks' musicianship were just what Dylan needed after the [...] "globe-trotting psychosis" [...] of the 1965–66 tour. Continued recording at the Big Pink was impossible because of the fanbase that had built up around Dylan. He even reported finding a couple in his bed once.|$|E
500|$|The fifth {{match of}} the event was an Intercontinental Championship match between The Ultimate Warrior and the reigning {{champion}} The Honky Tonk Man, who was accompanied by Jimmy Hart. Before the match it had been announced that Honky's original challenger, Brutus Beefcake, was unable to wrestle due to being attacked the previous week by Outlaw Ron Bass who had raked his cowboy spurs repeatedly across Beefcake's forehead (television and even the PPV only showed the censored version of the attack). Prior to the match, the Honky Tonk Man refused to be informed about Beefcake's replacement and immediately before the match, even grabbed ring announcer Howard Finkel's microphone and said [...] "Give me someone <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> wrestle, I don't care who it is". His challenge was answered by The Ultimate Warrior. Warrior, who accidentally knocked Finkel to the floor when he rushed into the ring and hit the ropes, had the advantage from the beginning, attacking The Honky Tonk Man, who {{was still in his}} entrance attire. After body-slamming him to the mat and following it up with a clothesline, The Warrior bounded to the ropes and landed stomach-first on The Honky Tonk Man using his signature move, the Warrior Splash. The Ultimate Warrior then pinned The Honky Tonk Man after only thirty-one seconds to win the title. The longest Intercontinental title reign in WWF history had ended with one of the shortest IC title matches in history. This match was probably the one where the audience cheered the loudest; the moment the Warrior defeated the hapless Honky Tonk Man, the fans erupted with cheers, with many even voting it the match of the year.|$|E

He walked into the office with a scrapbook of clippings in 1952 {{and asked for a}} tryout. He was recommended to the Rams by Gabby Sims and signed as a free agent. Lane initially tried out as a receiver, the position he had played at Fort Ord, but was switched to a defensive back by the Rams. In the Rams' first scrimmage on August 3, 1952, Lane drew praise as [...] "the outstanding player in the scrimmage by a country mile" [...] due to his [...] "ferocious" [...] approach to the game and his speed in chasing down Elroy Hirsch. After the scrimmage, Rams head coach Joe Stydahar said, [...] "Lane came <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> make the ball club. Well, last night he got himself a job." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{largest and}} most {{important}} room in the Low German house was the great central threshing floor, the Diele (Low German: Deele, Del). This was usually entered via the great, rounded door at the gable end, known in Low German as the Grote Dör, Groot Dör or Grotendör ("great door"). [...] The door was also the entrance for harvest wagons leading to the Diele which was like a cavernous hall, hence the alternative name {{for this type of}} farmhouse, the Hallenhaus ("hall house"). The Diele was formed by the space between the two rows of supporting uprights. With its tamped clay floor it was the working room of the farmhouse. It was here that the harvest was gathered before being stored in the hayloft above. It also provided protection from the weather for activities, such as the drying of farm implements, the breaking of flax, the spinning of textiles or the threshing of grain. Celebrations, too, were held in the hall and recently deceased members of the family were laid <b>out</b> <b>here.</b> <b>To</b> both sides of the Diele were the half-open stalls or stables (Kübbungen) for cattle or horses, as well as chambers for the maids and farmhands. Poultry would be kept near the entrance way {{at the edges of the}} hall. From the outset pigs were banished to separate sheds outside the building due to their smell. Only when living quarters and the Diele area were fully separated from one another could pigs also be encountered in the hall. The Diele opened out into the open eating and kitchen area, the so-called Flett.|$|E
