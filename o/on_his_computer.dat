25|$|Ackerson was {{not worried}} with the album being perfect; for example, when Pierre forgot {{to record a}} lyric at the studio, he {{recorded}} it <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>computer</b> {{and sent it to}} Ackerson, who simply added reverb and mixed it into the recording. The band at the time considered their work on Go a step further than anything they had done prior, which included hiring a live string ensemble to perform. The band finished 16–17 songs, using 11 for the album and the remainder for B-sides and bonus tracks.|$|E
25|$|Once he had {{finished}} work on the theme demos, Sawano created the score for orchestra and band. He created the broader orchestral elements <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>computer,</b> adding the smaller layers and elements himself so he had complete control over how the score evolved.

After creating the main theme and the core musical themes, he then moved on {{to the rest of the}} soundtrack—estimated at over ninety tracks—over three different periods during production. Due to Takahashi's liking for Sawano's music, Sawano had the freedom to stick to his musical style. The score was directed and co-produced by Legendoor's Yasushi Horiguchi, who was brought on board the project alongside Sawano.|$|E

French-Canadian journalist William Reymond received {{a copy of the}} photograph via the Internet, anonymously, apparently a copy of a tweet originating from the Ottawa Police of the cellphone picture. Reymond then took a picture of the image as it was displayed <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>computer</b> monitor and posted it to Twitter a few hours later after confirming the image. The image was re-tweeted by an ISIL sympathizer, leading to erroneous media reports that the image originated from an ISIL Twitter account.|$|E
25|$|Meehan {{was arrested}} on 2 April, on {{suspicion}} of possessing indecent images of children, after police had examined computers in the home. He was remanded in custody by Dewsbury Magistrates, at a hearing on 3 April charged with 11 offences of possessing indecent images of children. On 18 April 2008 Meehan pleaded not guilty, and elected to be tried by magistrate rather than by jury. On 16 September 2008, Meehan was convicted by Dewsbury Magistrates of 11 counts of possessing child pornography, relating to 49 images of level one, two, three and four found <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>computer</b> after it was seized from the house he lived in with Karen Matthews, on Moorside Road. On the same day, {{he was sentenced to}} 20 weeks imprisonment but was released as he had spent longer on remand than the length of the sentence.|$|E
25|$|In August 1998 {{taxi driver}} John Shaw, from Hyde, {{contacted}} the police, informing {{them that he}} suspected Shipman of murdering 21 of his patients. Grundy's daughter, lawyer Angela Woodruff, became concerned when solicitor Brian Burgess informed her that a will had been made, apparently by her mother. There were doubts about its authenticity. The will excluded her and her children, but left £386,000 to Shipman. Burgess told Woodruff to report it, {{and she went to}} the police, who began an investigation. Grundy's body was exhumed, and when examined was found to contain traces of diamorphine, often used for pain control in terminal cancer patients. Shipman claimed that she was an addict and showed them comments in his compuerised medical journal, but a program <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>computer</b> showed they were written after her death. Shipman was arrested on 7 September 1998, and was found to own a typewriter of the kind used to make the forged will.|$|E

25|$|One of its {{sources for}} the 1980s and 1990s was Roy Bullock, an {{intelligence}} gatherer for the South African apartheid regime, a private collector of information. He amassed files on 10,000–12,000 individuals and 600 organizations and provided them to the ADL as a secretly paid independent contractor for over 32 years. Bullock often wrote letters to various groups and forwarded copies of their replies to the ADL, clipped articles from newspapers and magazines, and maintained files <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>computer.</b> He also used less orthodox, and possibly illegal, methods such as combing through trash and tapping into White Aryan Resistance's phone message system {{in order to find}} evidence of hate crimes. Some of the information he obtained and then passed on to the ADL came from confidential documents (including intelligence files on various Nazi groups and driver's license records and other personal information on nearly 1,400 people) that were given to him by San Francisco police officer and former CIA agent Tom Gerard.|$|E
25|$|Michael has {{brown eyes}} and thick, dark hair and is tall. He is {{extremely}} handsome, nice, funny, smart, and manly, despite staying cooped up writing songs or <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>computer</b> the whole day. Michael is romantic and talented. Though he often clashes with his younger sister, Michael and Lilly are in fact close siblings and friends. He used to have his own webzine called Crackhead but had to disband it after an editorial that stated the merits of Linux over Windows, which caused a loss in advertisers and funds. Shortly after this, Michael decided to start a band called Skinner Box (name suggested by Mia), which refers to an experiment by the behavioural psychologist B. F. Skinner into proving {{the existence of a}} 'conditioned response', {{with the use of a}} specially designed box that held animals (such as rats and monkeys, in the experiment) until release, which could only be activated by pressing a lever. He started it with a few friends, including Boris Pelkowski.|$|E
500|$|In 2015 UK Crown Prosecution Service {{announced}} {{prosecution of}} Bukovsky for [...] "prohibited images" [...] found <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>computer.</b> Bukovsky described the accusations as absurd {{and pointed out}} that the tip about the images – most likely planted <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>computer</b> by a backdoor program – was passed through Europol from Russian security services. Bukovsky also noted that while the original announcement by CPS accused him of [...] "possession and making", the prosecution materials passed to the court only mentioned [...] "possession".|$|E
5000|$|In August 2012, Simon Walsh, {{a former}} aide to London mayor Boris Johnson, was charged with {{possessing}} five images of [...] "extreme pornography", which were not found by police <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>computers,</b> but as email attachments on a Hotmail server account. He was found not guilty on all counts. Three images were of urethral sounding, and two of anal fisting. The images were all of consensual adult sexual activity. The Crown Prosecution Service maintains that the acts depicted were “extreme” even if the jury disagreed in this case.|$|R

At his 2007 trial, prosecutors introduced as evidence a journal he kept <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>computer</b> in which he stated his intention to kill her. In it he wrote, [...] "She just never talked to peons like us" [...] to justify his intended actions.|$|E

Having worked with record {{producer}} and multi-instrumentalist Jeff Bhasker on Doo-Wops & Hooligans, Mars enlisted him and Mark Ronson as he wanted the record to incorporate live instrumentation, but to still be suitable for clubs; Bhasker particularly admitted that it sounded great on the radio. American disc jockey Diplo was able to further push the album from the [...] "safety net" [...] with something for the [...] club on [...] "Money Makes Her Smile"; Mars claimed that the DJ could make the club go [...] "wild" [...] due to the sounds <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>computer.</b>|$|E
500|$|Dyer, who, at the time, was a 51-year-old widower and {{unsuccessful}} businessman {{living with}} his two teenage daughters, was placed under surveillance. The surveillance operation did not yield any results, so the police decided to confront Dyer and visited him at his home on 19 February, where they found an extortion note <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>computer</b> and cryptic notes in his handwriting. Dyer was arrested and interviewed. The police later intercepted the final letter from [...] "Sally", which surveillance footage showed Dyer posting {{the day before he}} was arrested and which was an exact match to the letter found on Dyer's computer.
