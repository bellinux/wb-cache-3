5|$|Building {{upon the}} gene-chromosome theory of {{heredity}} that originated with Gregor Mendel (1822–1884), August Weismann (1834–1914) proved that inheritance <b>only</b> <b>takes</b> place through gametes. No other cells can pass on inherited characters. The work of Katherine Esau (1898–1997) on plant anatomy {{is still a}} major foundation of modern botany. Her books Plant Anatomy and Anatomy of Seed Plants have been key plant structural biology texts {{for more than half}} a century.|$|E
5|$|The {{adult male}} and female both are active in {{protecting}} and feeding the fledged chicks until they learn to forage on their own. The adult robin gives alarm calls and dives in a threatening manner towards creatures it considers potential predators, such as approaching cats, dogs and humans. The fledglings are able to fly short distances after leaving the nest. The wings of juvenile birds develop rapidly, and it <b>only</b> <b>takes</b> {{a couple of weeks}} for them to become proficient at flying. The cryptically colored young birds perch in bushes or trees for protection from predators.|$|E

5|$|In most species, {{the sexes}} are {{separate}} {{and there is}} little sexual dimorphism, but a few species are hermaphroditic and some parasitic forms show large differences between the sexes. Some Cymothoidans are protandrous hermaphrodites, starting life as males and later changing sex, and some Anthuroideans are the reverse, being protogynous hermaphrodites that are born female. Some Gnathiidans males are sessile and live with a group of females. Males have a pair of penises, which may be fused in some species. The sperm is transferred to the female by the modified second pleopod which receives it from the penis and which is then inserted into a female gonopore. The sperm is stored in a special receptacle, a swelling on the oviduct close to the gonopore. Fertilisation <b>only</b> <b>takes</b> place when the eggs are shed soon after a moult, at which time a connection is established between the semen receptacle and the oviduct.|$|E
5|$|On April9, CSU also {{released}} its first quantitative forecast for the 2015 hurricane season, predicting 7 named storms, 3 hurricanes, 1 major hurricane, and a cumulative ACE index of 40 units. The combination of cooler than average {{waters in the}} tropical and subtropical Atlantic, {{as well as a}} developing El Niño predicted to reach at least moderate intensity, were expected to favor one of the least active seasons since the mid-1990s. The probabilities of a major hurricane striking various coastal areas across the Atlantic were lower than average, although CSU stressed that it <b>only</b> <b>takes</b> one landfalling hurricane to make it an active season for residents involved. On April13, North Carolina State University (NCSU) {{released its}} forecast, predicting a near record-low season with just 4 to 6 named storms, 1 to 3 hurricanes, and 1 major hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Weapons {{range from}} pistols to shotguns, assault rifles, and sniper rifles. Although {{all of them}} have {{unlimited}} ammunition, they overheat if fired continuously for prolonged periods. In addition, the player can use grenades which latch onto targets or flat surfaces to be remotely detonated. Shepard and the squad members are protected by a health bar and damage-absorbing shields. The health bar <b>only</b> <b>takes</b> damage once the shields have been destroyed, but environmental hazards like heat or toxic agents may directly affect the health bar if they are not negated entirely by wearing appropriate armor. The health bar can be restored with the use of items called Medi-gels, while shields automatically regenerate when not taking fire for a brief period. Some talents and equipment items can improve the healing rate or shield regeneration. The player can revive fallen squad members {{with the use of the}} Unity talent. However, if Shepard dies, the player must start the game again from the last saved point.|$|E

25|$|Single-pass bore {{finishing}} is a {{machining process}} similar to honing {{to finish a}} , except the tool <b>only</b> <b>takes</b> a single pass. The process was originally developed to improve bore quality in cast iron workpieces.|$|E

25|$|The lytic cycle, or {{productive}} infection, {{results in}} the production of infectious virions. EBV can undergo lytic replication in both B cells and epithelial cells. In B cells, lytic replication normally <b>only</b> <b>takes</b> place after reactivation from latency. In epithelial cells, lytic replication often directly follows viral entry.|$|E
25|$|The other ferry {{service to}} Fukuoka is assumed by the Beetles and the Kobees, 2 fleets of {{high-speed}} hydrofoils operated by Miraejet. About five departures from each city are scheduled every day. By hydrofoil it <b>only</b> <b>takes</b> 2 hours 55 minutes {{to cross the}} Korea Strait to Fukuoka. The Beetles are owned by JR Kyushu.|$|E
25|$|Once combat {{damage is}} dealt, the now 5/5 Grizzly Bears deal 5 {{damage to the}} Hill Giant and easily kills it. Hill Giant {{attempts}} to deal 3 damage to the Grizzly Bears, but the remainder of Norman's damage prevention shield prevents a further 2 damage (totaling 4 damage) and Grizzly Bears <b>only</b> <b>takes</b> 1 damage.|$|E

25|$|In the {{bottom-up}} approach, we {{calculate the}} smaller values of fib first, then build larger values from them. This method also uses O(n) time since {{it contains a}} loop that repeats n − 1 times, but it <b>only</b> <b>takes</b> constant (O(1)) space, {{in contrast to the}} top-down approach which requires O(n) space to store the map.|$|E
25|$|Metrorail {{operates}} the Orange Line train from Miami International Airport to destinations such as Downtown, Brickell, Civic Center, Coconut Grove, Coral Gables, Dadeland, Hialeah, South Miami and Wynwood. It <b>only</b> <b>takes</b> about 15 {{minutes to get}} from the airport to Downtown via Metrorail. Fares are $2, which also allows for a free transfer to Metrobus if needed.|$|E
25|$|The War in Abkhazia in 1998 {{took place}} in the Gali {{district}} of Abkhazia, after ethnic Georgians launched an insurgency against the Abkhazian secessionist government. The conflict is sometimes referred to as the Six-Day War of Abkhazia however this name <b>only</b> <b>takes</b> into account the Abkhazian May 20, 1998 - May 26, 1998 offensive while hostilities and insurgent attacks had already occurred before that date.|$|E

25|$|On {{her first}} rock, Jennifer Jones draws to the button behind cover to sit one. In {{an attempt to}} force Jones to a sole point, Amber Holland {{attempts}} a freeze on to the shot rock to narrow the scoring area. However, her stone corner freezes to shot rock, leaving it open, and giving Jones an intricate shot for two or three. Jones hits the Saskatchewan stone at the wrong angle, and <b>only</b> <b>takes</b> the one.|$|E
25|$|A literal {{term for}} SSTV is {{narrowband}} television. Analog broadcast television requires at least 6MHz wide channels, because it transmits 25 or 30 picture {{frames per second}} (in the NTSC, PAL or SECAM color systems), but SSTV usually <b>only</b> <b>takes</b> up {{to a maximum of}} 3kHz of bandwidth. It is a much slower method of still picture transmission, usually taking from about eight seconds to a couple of minutes, depending on the mode used, to transmit one image frame.|$|E
