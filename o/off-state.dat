25|$|After {{the current}} in a {{thyristor}} has extinguished, a finite time delay must elapse before the anode can again be positively biased and retain the thyristor in the <b>off-state.</b> This minimum delay {{is called the}} circuit commutated turn off time (tQ).

25|$|As {{the channel}} length becomes very short, these {{equations}} become quite inaccurate. New physical effects arise. For example, carrier transport {{in the active}} mode may become limited by velocity saturation. When velocity saturation dominates, the saturation drain current is more nearly linear than quadratic in VGS. At even shorter lengths, carriers transport with near zero scattering, known as quasi-ballistic transport. In the ballistic regime, the carriers travel at an injection velocity that may exceed the saturation velocity and approaches the Fermi velocity at high inversion charge density. In addition, drain-induced barrier lowering increases <b>off-state</b> (cutoff) current and requires an increase in threshold voltage to compensate, which in turn reduces the saturation current.|$|E
25|$|Semiconductor sub-micrometer and {{nanometer}} {{electronic circuits}} {{are the primary}} concern for operating within the normal tolerance in harsh radiation environments like outer space. One of the design approaches for making a radiation-hardened-by-design (RHBD) device is Enclosed-Layout-Transistor (ELT). Normally, {{the gate of the}} MOSFET surrounds the drain, which is placed {{in the center of the}} ELT. The source of the MOSFET surrounds the gate. Another RHBD MOSFET is called H-Gate. Both of these transistors have very low leakage current with respect to radiation. However, they are large in size and take more space on silicon than a standard MOSFET. In older STI (shallow trench isolation) designs, radiation strikes near the silicon oxide region cause the channel inversion at the corners of the standard MOSFET due to accumulation of radiation induced trapped charges. If the charges are large enough, the accumulated charges affect STI surface edges along the channel near the channel interface (gate) of the standard MOSFET. Thus the device channel inversion occurs along the channel edges and the device creates <b>off-state</b> leakage path, causing device to turn on. So the reliability of circuits degrades severely. The ELT offers many advantages. These advantages include improvement of reliability by reducing unwanted surface inversion at the gate edges that occurs in the standard MOSFET. Since the gate edges are enclosed in ELT, there is no gate oxide edge (STI at gate interface), and thus the transistor <b>off-state</b> leakage is reduced very much. Low-power microelectronic circuits including computers, communication devices and monitoring systems in space shuttle and satellites are very different from what we use on earth. They are radiation (high-speed atomic particles like proton and neutron, solar flare magnetic energy dissipation in Earth's space, energetic cosmic rays like X-ray, gamma ray etc.) tolerant circuits. These special electronics are designed by applying very different techniques using RHBD MOSFETs to ensure the safe space journey and also space-walk of astronauts.|$|E

Thus, we analysed high-density wake EEG recordings during an auditory attention task in the morning and evening in 12 children. We found that, theta waves became more widespread in the evening and the occurrence of widespread theta waves was associated with slower reaction times in the attention task.

40|$|Context: Vela X- 1 is the {{prototype}} of the classical sgHMXB systems. Recent continuous and long monitoring campaigns revealed a large hard X-rays variability amplitude with strong flares and <b>off-states.</b> This activity has been interpreted invoking clumpy stellar winds and/or magnetic gating mechanisms. Aims: We are probing if the observed behaviour {{could be explained by}} unstable hydrodynamic flows close to the neutron star rather than the more exotic phenomena. Methods: We have used the hydrodynamic code VH- 1 to simulate the flow of the stellar wind with high temporal resolution and to compare the predicted accretion rate with the observed light-curves. Results: The simulation results are similar to the observed variability. <b>Off-states</b> are predicted with a duration of 5 to 120 minutes corresponding to transient low density bubbles forming around the neutron star. Oscillations of the accretion rate with a typical period of ∼ 6800 sec are generated in our simulations and observed. They correspond to the complex motion of a bow shock, moving either towards or away from the neutron star. Flares are also produced by the simulations up to a level of 10 ^ 37 erg/s. Conclusions: We have qualitatively reproduced the hard X-ray variations observed in Vela X- 1 with hydrodynamic instabilities predicted by a simple model. More sophisticated phenomena, such as clumpy winds or the magnetic gating mechanism, are not excluded but not required to explain the basic phenomenology.

Also, the electrons might receive scattering by the impurities on the SiO 2 surface and trapped to the drawbacks of the emitter. As the gate voltage increases beyond the threshold voltage, the width of the barrier is compressed accordingly. The electrons could overcome the narrowed barrier via the F-N tunneling, leading to the on-state of the NVCT. Moreover, the tunability of graphene energy band by gate voltage may be another contribution, as electrical conductivity of single-layer graphene can be modulated by gate voltage. As the gate voltage increases, the Fermi level EF shift to the conduction band, thus, enhance the electron density of the graphene surface and improve the emission current.|$|R

In order to further elucidate the multiple processes taking place in this entity, measurements were done in which the polarisation direction of the linear polarised excitation light was modulated. The detection was sensitive for the s- and p-components of the emitted light. The patterns of modulation and relative intensity in the acquired traces reflect the energy transfer processes occurring in this multichromophoric molecule. In-phase modulation and no modulation are the typical modulation patterns that were observed. Simulations involving several models for energy transfer between the chromophores have been carried out taking into account identical conditions as for the performed measurements.

40|$|We {{present the}} first {{demonstration}} {{of control of}} the emission lifetime of a biological emitter by manipulating the local density of optical states (LDOS). LDOS control is achieved by positioning the emitters at defined distances from a metallic mirror. This results in a characteristic oscillation in the fluorescence decay rate. Since only the emitting species contribute to the emission lifetimes, the radiative and nonradiative decay rates derived from the lifetime changes characterize specifically the on- states of the emitter. We have thus experimentally determined the decay rates, and by extension the quantum efficiency and emission oscillator strength, of exclusively the emitting states of the widely used Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP). This approach {{is in contrast to}} other methods that average over emitting and dark states. The quantum efficiency of the on-states determined for EGFP is 72 %. This value is higher than previously reported values determined by methods that average over on- and <b>off-states,</b> as is expected for this system with known dark states.

The fabricated FeFETs have excellent data retention characteristics: The drain current ratio between the on- and <b>off-states</b> of a FeFET {{was more than}} 2 × 106 after 12 days, and the decreasing rate of this ratio was so small that the extrapolated drain current ratio after 10 years is larger than 1 × 105.

The developed FeFETs also revealed stable retention characteristics at an elevated temperature up to 120 °C and had small transistor threshold voltage (Vth) distribution. The Vth can be adjusted by controlling channel impurity densities for both n-channel and p-channel FeFETs.
