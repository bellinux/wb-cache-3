5|$|Australian Submarine Corporation {{was made}} {{responsible}} for the delivery of the Rockwell combat system, but had little ability to enforce this. Rockwell was contracted to deliver the combat system by 9 September 1993, but was unlikely to do so. ASC's management board voted to issue a default notice to Rockwell as the American company had defaulted on the contract, but was ordered by the Department of Defence to retract the default notice and accept gradual delivery of partially completed versions of the combat system—referred to as 'releases' and 'drops'—until the complete system had been delivered. Sea trials of Collins were unable to commence until Release 1.5 of the combat system software was delivered; because of ongoing delays in the provision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>software,</b> the early phases of the trials were completed using stand-alone equipment By March 1994, the combat system had become the major area {{of concern for the}} submarine project: assembly of the system was almost nine months behind schedule, and at least 20% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>software</b> had not been compiled. The combat system continued to be a problem during the next few years, with progressive drops offering little improvements in performance over the previous version, and the completion date of Release 2—the designation for the full contractual realisation of the combat system software—was continually postponed.|$|E

This work was done by Brian Aker, Patrick Galbraith and Chris Nandor, resulting in version 2 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>software,</b> released in 2001.

The efforts of Skolelinux, Debian-Med and Debian-Accessibility raised the number of packages that were educational, had a medical affiliation, and ones made for people with disabilities.|$|E

5|$|Each {{submarine}} {{was constructed}} in six sections, each consisting of several sub-sections. One of the main criteria {{of the project was}} that Australian industries contribute to at least 60% of the work; by the conclusion of the project 70% of the construction and 45% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>software</b> preparation had been completed by Australian-owned companies. Work was sub-contracted out to 426companies across twelve countries, plus numerous sub-sub-contractors. In many cases, components for the first submarine were constructed by companies outside Australia, while those for the following five boats were replicated by an Australian-owned partner or subsidiary. The project prompted major increases in quality control standards across Australian industries: in 1980, only 35Australian companies possessed the appropriate quality control certifications for Defence projects, but by 1998 this had increased to over 1,500.|$|E
