5|$|In {{the course}} of a 25-minute test an early R engine would consume 60Imperial gallons (gal) (270L) of {{pre-heated}} castor oil. The majority of this was spat out of the exhaust ports and smothered the test cell walls, milk being given to staff to minimise the effects of this well-known laxative. Up to 200gal (900L) of the special fuel blend had to be mixed for each test, 80gal (360L) of which were used just to warm the engine to <b>operating</b> <b>temperature.</b> The same coarse-pitch propeller used for flight trials was fitted throughout these tests.|$|E
5|$|The {{contamination}} caused what {{is known}} as a hard alpha inclusion, where a contaminant particle in a metal alloy causes the metal around it to become brittle. The brittle titanium around the impurity then cracked during forging and fell out during final machining, leaving a cavity with microscopic cracks at the edges. For the next 18 years, the cracks all grew slightly each time the engine was powered up and brought to <b>operating</b> <b>temperature</b> and finally broke open, causing the disk to fail.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Joel E. Goldmacher and Joseph A. Castellano, {{research}} chemists in Heilmeier {{group at}} RCA, discovered that mixtures made exclusively of nematic compounds that differed {{only in the}} number of carbon atoms in the terminal side chains could yield room-temperature nematic liquid crystals. A ternary mixture of Schiff base compounds resulted in a material that had a nematic range of 22–105°C. Operation at room temperature enabled the first practical display device to be made. The team then proceeded to prepare numerous mixtures of nematic compounds many of which had much lower melting points. This technique of mixing nematic compounds to obtain wide <b>operating</b> <b>temperature</b> range eventually became the industry standard and is used to this very day to tailor materials to meet specific applications.|$|E

5|$|The {{composition}} of most ash {{is such that}} its melting temperature is within the <b>operating</b> <b>temperature</b> (>1000 °C) of modern large jet engines. The degree of impact depends upon the concentration of ash in the plume, {{the length of time}} the aircraft spends within the plume and the actions taken by the pilots. Critically, melting of ash, particularly volcanic glass, can result in accumulation of resolidified ash on turbine nozzle guide vanes, resulting in compressor stall and complete loss of engine thrust. The standard procedure of the engine control system when it detects a possible stall is to increase power which would exacerbate the problem. It is recommended that pilots reduce engine power and quickly exit the cloud by performing a descending 180° turn. Volcanic gases, which are present within ash clouds, can also cause damage to engines and acrylic windshields, although this damage may not surface for many years.|$|E
25|$|The high <b>operating</b> <b>temperature</b> {{is largely}} due to the {{physical}} properties of the YSZ electrolyte. As temperature decreases, so does the ionic conductivity of YSZ. Therefore, to obtain optimum performance of the fuel cell, a high <b>operating</b> <b>temperature</b> is required. According to their website, Ceres Power, a UK SOFC fuel cell manufacturer, has developed a method of reducing the <b>operating</b> <b>temperature</b> of their SOFC system to 500–600 degrees Celsius. They replaced the commonly used YSZ electrolyte with a CGO (cerium gadolinium oxide) electrolyte. The lower <b>operating</b> <b>temperature</b> allows them to use stainless steel instead of ceramic as the cell substrate, which reduces cost and start-up time of the system.|$|E
