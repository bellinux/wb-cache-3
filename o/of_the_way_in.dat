5|$|All {{observation}} involves both {{perception and}} cognition. That is, {{one does not}} make an observation passively, but rather is actively engaged in distinguishing the phenomenon being observed from surrounding sensory data. Therefore, observations are affected by one's underlying understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> which the world functions, and that understanding may influence what is perceived, noticed, or deemed worthy of consideration. In this sense, {{it can be argued}} that all observation is theory-laden.|$|E

Back in the isolation tank, Walternate has had Olivia extracted from the tank and directs his agents to lock her up and sedate her.|$|E
5|$|The {{aerodynamics}} of a {{wind turbine}} are not straightforward. The air flow at the blades {{is not the}} same as the airflow far away from the turbine. The very nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> which energy is extracted from the air also causes air to be deflected by the turbine. In addition the aerodynamics of a wind turbine at the rotor surface exhibit phenomena that are rarely seen in other aerodynamic fields. The shape and dimensions of the blades of the wind turbine are determined by the aerodynamic performance required to efficiently extract energy from the wind, and by the strength required to resist the forces on the blade.|$|E
5|$|Fellow {{players on}} the Italian {{national}} team nicknamed Pirlo l'architetto ("the Architect"), because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> which he buildt plays, and set up goal-scoring opportunities with long, lobbed through passes. In later seasons, Juventus fans also dubbed him il professore ("the professor"), Maestro, and Mozart, as {{a reference to the}} Austrian composer's prodigious ability. Pirlo was also frequently compared to fellow former Milan and Italy playmaker Demetrio Albertini early in his Milan career, due to their similar characteristics and style of play. Pirlo was often thought to be Albertini's heir for Milan and the national side; he inherited his nickname the metronome whilst playing at Milan, for the way in which he influenced games by controlling the tempo of his team's play through his direct and efficient passing game in midfield, as well as his ability to make himself available to teammates to receive and distribute the ball.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1130s England began to descend into {{a period of}} civil war known as the Anarchy, during which the {{supporters}} of King Stephen fought {{with those of the}} Empress Matilda for control of the kingdom. William de Mohun's eldest son, also called William, was a noted supporter of Matilda, and Dunster was considered one of her faction's strongest castles in the south-west. In 1138 forces loyal to Stephen besieged the castle; a siege castle was built nearby, but all trace of it has been lost. William successfully held the castle and was made the Earl of Somerset by the grateful Empress. Chroniclers subsequently complained <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> which he subsequently raided and controlled the region by force during the war, causing much destruction. In the aftermath of the conflict, William's son, another William, inherited the castle after a short period of royal ownership under Henry II. William appears to have insisted that his tenants agree to help repair and maintain the castle walls as part of their feudal service.|$|E

25|$|When {{artificial}} light affects organisms and ecosystems {{it is called}} ecological light pollution. While light at night can be beneficial, neutral, or damaging for individual species, its presence invariably disturbs ecosystems. For example, some species of spiders avoid lit areas, while other species are happy to build their spider web directly on a lamp post. Since lamp posts attract many flying insects, the spiders that don't mind light, gain an advantage over the spiders that avoid it. This is a simple example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> which species frequencies and food webs can be disturbed {{by the introduction of}} light at night.|$|E
