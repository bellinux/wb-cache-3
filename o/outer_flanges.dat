40|$|This article {{introduces}} the static scheme, the construction method and the seismic-resistant designing of the Fluvià Viaduct, {{which has a}} total length of 835 m (45 + 10 x 60 + 2 x 70 + 50 m) and an average height of 18 m. So, it is the longest viaduct in the Barcelona-Madrid-French Border section between Barcelona and France. The spans of this structure are medium-long for prestressed concrete solutions in Spain. The general concept of the structure is a 14 span continuous post-tensioning prestressed concrete main girder, simply supported in piers and abutments, with a useful width of 14 m. The main girder cross-section is a 4. 0 m depth one-cell box with quasi-vertical webs, which results in an close-to-optimum length to depth ratio of L/ 15 for the typical spans. In piers P- 11; P- 12 and P- 13 depth grows linearly up to 5. 5 m in order to adapt properly to the bending moments appearing in longer spans. The main girder is prestressed {{to one of the}} abutments, which acts as fixed point of the structure for supporting horizontal longitudinal actions like traction-braking forces and earthquake loads. With a fixed end in one abutment, the viaduct has a total expanding length of 835 m, which is far from the maximum expansion length reached in others structures in Spain, but nearly close to the recommended maximum length that can be solved with conventional track devices. Earthquake loads are the limiting factor in the design of most of the elements of the substructure (foundations, piers and abutments, and diaphragms). The construction method for the piers and the abutments is the most common for this sort of structural parts, and the greatest engineering effort is done to design the girder for a span-by-span construction with a self-bearing falsework designed initially for road bridges of 50 m of maximum spans. The use of this available self-bearing falsework {{for the construction of a}} railway viaduct (with a cross-section heavier than a highway cross-section for the same span length) deals directly with most of the limitations that influenced the design and construction of the girder. It was necessary to limit the load on the falsework girders to an allowable limit, that prevented from casting the whole cross-section at once.

40|$|The fire {{performance}} of cold-formed steel members {{is an important}} criterion to be verified for their successful use in structural applications. However, lack of clear design guidance on their {{fire performance}} has inhibited their usage in buildings. Their elevated temperature mechanical properties, i. e., yield strengths, elastic moduli and stress–strain relationships, are imperative for the fire design. In the past many researchers have proposed elevated temperature mechanical property reduction factors for cold-formed steels, however, large variations exist among them. The LiteSteel Beam (LSB), a hollow flange channel section, is manufactured by a combined cold-forming and electric resistance welding process. Its web, inner and <b>outer</b> <b>flange</b> elements have different yield strengths due to varying levels of cold-working caused by their manufacturing process. Elevated temperature mechanical properties of LSBs {{are not the same}} even within their cross-sections. Therefore an experimental study was undertaken to determine the elevated temperature mechanical properties of steel plate elements in LSBs. Elevated temperature tensile tests were performed on web, inner and <b>outer</b> <b>flange</b> specimens taken from LSBs, and their results are presented in this paper including their comparisons with previous studies. Based on the test results and the proposed values from previous studies and fire design standards, suitable predictive equations are proposed for the determination of elevated temperature mechanical properties of LSB web and flange elements.

40|$|A {{method has}} been devised {{to enable the}} {{fabrication}} of lightweight pressure vessels from multilayer composite materials. This method is related to, but not the same as, the method described in gMaking a Metal- Lined Composite-Overwrapped Pressure Vessel h (MFS- 31814), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 29, No. 3 (March 2005), page 59. The method is flexible in that it poses no major impediment to changes in tank design and is applicable {{to a wide range}} of tank sizes. The figure depicts a finished tank fabricated by this method, showing layers added at various stages of the fabrication process. In the first step of the process, a mandrel that defines the size and shape of the interior of the tank is machined from a polyurethane foam or other suitable lightweight tooling material. The mandrel is outfitted with metallic end fittings on a shaft. Each end fitting includes an <b>outer</b> <b>flange</b> that has a small step to accommodate a thin layer of graphite/epoxy or other suitable composite material. The outer surface of the mandrel (but not the fittings) is covered with a suitable release material. The composite material is filament- wound so as to cover the entire surface of the mandrel from the step on one end fitting to the step on the other end fitting. The composite material is then cured in place. The entire workpiece is cut in half in a plane perpendicular to the axis of symmetry at its mid-length point, yielding two composite-material half shells, each containing half of the foam mandrel. The halves of the mandrel are removed from within the composite shells, then the shells are reassembled and bonded together with a belly band of cured composite material. The resulting composite shell becomes a mandrel for the subsequent steps of the fabrication process and remains inside the final tank. The outer surface of the composite shell is covered with a layer of material designed to be impermeable by the pressurized fluid to be contained in the tank. A second step on the <b>outer</b> <b>flange</b> of each end fitting accommodates this layer. Depending on the application, this layer could be, for example, a layer of rubber, a polymer film, or an electrodeposited layer of metal. If the fluid to be contained in the tank is a gas, then the best permeation barrier is electrodeposited metal (typically copper or nickel), which can be effective at a thickness of as little as 0. 005 in (. 0. 13 mm). The electrodeposited metal becomes molecularly bonded to the second step on each metallic end fitting. The permeation-barrier layer is covered with many layers of filament-wound composite material, which could be the same as, or different from, the composite material of the inner shell. Finally, the filament-wound composite material is cured in an o...|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} {{was developed for}} calculating the radial temperature distribution in a gas turbine with only the temperatures of the gas and the cooling air and the surface heat-transfer coefficient known. This {{analysis was}} applied to determine the temperatures of a complete wheel of a conventional single-stage impulse exhaust-gas turbine. The temperatures were first calculated for {{the case of the}} turbine operating at design conditions of speed, gas flow, etc. and with only the customary cooling arising from exposure of the <b>outer</b> blade <b>flange</b> and one face of the rotor to the air. Calculations were next made for the case of fins applied to the <b>outer</b> blade <b>flange</b> and the rotor. Finally the effects of using part of the nozzles (from 0 to 40 percent) for supplying cooling air and the effects of varying the metal thermal conductivity from 12 to 260 Btu per hour per foot per degree Farenheit on the wheel temperatures were determined. The gas temperatures at the nozzle box used in the calculations ranged from 1600 F to 2000 F. The results showed that if more than a few hundred degrees of cooling of turbine blades are required other means than indirect cooling with fins on the rotor and <b>outer</b> blade <b>flange</b> would be necessary. The amount of cooling indicated for the type of finning used could produce some improvement in efficiency and a large increase in durability of the wheel. The results also showed that if a large difference is to exist between the effective temperature of the exhaust gas and that of the blade material, as must be the case with present turbine materials and the high exhaust-gas temperatures desired (2000 F and above), two alternatives are suggested: (a) If metal with a thermal conductivity comparable with copper is used, then the blade temperature can be reduced by strong cooling at both the blade tip and root. The center of the blade will be less than 2000 F hotter than the ends; (b) With low conductivity materials some method of direct cooling other than partial admission of cooling air is essential. From this study, it can be deduced that indirect cooling of turbine blades will not make possible large increases in gas temperature...|$|R

40|$|In this {{investigation}} {{the process of}} forging an <b>outer</b> <b>flange</b> on a tube double-sided radial extrusion has been studied to achieve {{a better understanding of}} the mechanics governing material flow inside the die-cavity. Finite element models, capable of replicating all previously identified modes of deformation and related defects, were generated. A process analysis, based on these conditioned models, led to the proposal of an alternative operational sequence which includes the performing of a geometrically simple inner flange on the tube; the intention being to extended the existing formability limits set by folding due to instability of the tube wall. Preliminary experimental tests proved the concept to be feasible, and detailed studies, among others using animation as a post-processor, allowed a description of the changed flow mechanisms introduced by the new process configuration. Further numerical investigations were carried out to establish actual preform design rules for the radial extrusion of tubular components for a whole range of parameter combinations. The analysis was made in conjunction with experimental tests, performed to support the theoretical findings. As a mean to substantiate the feasibility of the radial extrusion concept and illustrate its production potential, an engineering component, that can be manufactured advantageously by radial extrusion, was produced in aluminium. The theoretical and experimental work on the extrusion of tubes furthermore led to an investigation on the numerical modelling of the friction conditions in bulk metal processes, and formed the technological basis for the development of an automatic remeshing and refinement scheme for quadrilateral finite elements meshes.

40|$|Currently, in Russia ultra-precision {{processing}} of various details (including details with difficult form) is demanded to manufacture innovative products in different spheres of industry. This processing {{can be performed}} using a special high-precision multi-axes machining center. However, such centers are very expensive and their supply to Russia is limited. Therefore, creating a modular principle-based special machine or stand with the minimal number of controlled axes to perform a specific processing is more efficient in many cases. The fewer number of movable components enhances a natural frequency of the machine, and its total stiffness and accuracy as well. The spindle units are used to perform the rotation in machines. The spindle unit characteristics have predominant influence on the machining accuracy and quality. This paper presents {{a model of the}} spindle unit “RTSH 020 ” (made in JSC «VNIIINSTRUMENT») which has two angular contact spherical aerostatic bearings. Design features of that type of spindle unit in comparison with the other aerostatic spindle unit designs allow creation of aerostatic bearings with a smaller gap and air consumption, as well as with a higher stiffness and damping characteristic. An impact-test was executed to determine the frequency, stiffness and coefficient of damping by different forms of a spindle oscillation. The impact impulses were applied to the <b>outer</b> <b>flange</b> of the spindle in different directions with its displacements measured by the high-precision capacitive sensors. It was revealed that an increase of feed pressure increased the stiffness and the oscillation frequency, but a damping coefficient and a decrement were decreased. PC with an analog-to-digital converter performed data records. Data calculations were performed using a fast Fourier transformation and a Prony filtration method. Tests were repeated after changing the air feed pressure to show its effect on the spindle unit characteristics. The test series showed that with increasing feed pressure the spindle stiffness and oscillation frequency increased too, but the damping coefficient and the logarithmic decrement as well decreased. Within the studied range the curves of all these characteristics versus the feed pressure were close to the linear ones. The certain characteristics depending on the feed pressure allow a selection of optimal operation conditions of the spindle unit for various applications. Design features of the spindle unit enable the use of two sensors in total to determine characteristics of radial, axial, and angular motion mode of spindle. </p...|$|R

The beam was subjected to vertical point loading at {{the centre of the}} longer span. Mid-span deflections, support rotations and <b>outer</b> surface <b>flange</b> strains recorded during major- and minor-axis flexure tests on the beam are presented and shown to be both repeatable and linear. New closed-form shear deformation equations are presented for the forces and displacements of two-span continuous beams of arbitrary span ratio with the longer span subjected to a vertical mid-span point load. The equations have been used to predict the mid-span deflections, support rotations and surface strains recorded during the flexure tests. It is shown that the equations are able to predict the experimental deflections accurately. Depending on the particular support, the rotations (particularly the minor-axis rotations) are slightly under/over-estimated and, in general, the surface strains are over-estimated.

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Civil Engineering)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. Doubly {{symmetric}} I-section columns {{are often}} utilised in portal frame construction. The sheeting (or cladding) is carried by sheeting rails {{connected to the}} <b>outer</b> <b>flange</b> of these columns. Although it is common practice to include the sheeting rails in the longitudinal bracing system, by connecting the sheeting rail to the cross-bracing, designers must be wary because the connection between column and sheeting rail will not prevent twisting of the columns cross-section. It has been shown ([11], [12], [17]), that by including this eccentric restraint into the bracing of the column, that a torsional-flexural buckling mode of failure can occur when the column is subjected to axial load only. It was seen that this phenomenon is provided for in BS 5950 [18], but is not present in many other design codes of practice, {{in spite of this}} phenomenon being relatively well known. In some cases the compression resistance of a column can be significantly reduced when compared to that of a flexural buckled configuration. Previous work performed by Helwig and Yura [15] proposed specific column to sheeting rail connections which would allow for the sheeting rails to be used as elastic torsional braces and effectively rigid lateral braces. However, it is the objective of this investigation to determine if it is possible to include the eccentric sheeting rails into the bracing system, even when using a relatively simple cleat connection with only two bolts onto the sheeting rail. The objective of the research was investigated by conducting experimental tests coupled with a series of detailed finite element analyses. The purpose of the experimental set-up was to investigate the behaviour of a column laterally supported on one flange by a continuous sheeting rail and to compare it to the behaviour of a column laterally supported on both flanges by means of fly-braces (“kneebraces”). The behaviour of the columns, as determined by the experimental tests, was validated by the finite element analyses. The evident conclusion that can be drawn is that, for the case of a continuous sheeting rail, connected to column simply by two bolts and a cleat, that sufficient torsional restraint is provided to the column to prevent torsional-flexural buckling from being critical. This result is helpful, as it means that the buckling capacity of a column can be increased four-fold by enforcing the second flexural buckling mode instead of the first mode through utilising a continuous sheeting rail connected to a cross-bracing system as longitudinal bracing on the columns. This can be achieved without the need to provide any specific detailing to the column to sheeting rail connection. It is however, recommended that further experimental work be conducted on varying lengths of column in order to further validate the results of this work...|$|R
40|$|Reducing {{blade tip}} {{clearances}} through active {{tip clearance control}} in the high pressure turbine can lead to significant reductions in emissions and specific fuel consumption as well as dramatic improvements in operating efficiency and increased service life. Current engines employ scheduled cooling of the <b>outer</b> case <b>flanges</b> to reduce high pressure turbine tip clearances during cruise conditions. These systems have relatively slow response and do not use clearance measurement, thereby forcing cold build clearances to set the minimum clearances at extreme operating conditions (e. g., takeoff, reburst) and not allowing cruise clearances to be minimized due {{to the possibility of}} throttle transients (e. g., step change in altitude). In an effort to improve upon current thermal methods, a first generation mechanically-actuated active clearance control (ACC) system has been designed and fabricated. The system utilizes independent actuators, a segmented shroud structure, and clearance measurement feedback to provide fast and precise active clearance control throughout engine operation. Ambient temperature performance tests of this first generation ACC system assessed individual seal component leakage rates and both static and dynamic overall system leakage rates. The ability of the nine electric stepper motors to control the position of the seal carriers in both open- and closed-loop control modes for single and multiple cycles was investigated. The ability of the system to follow simulated engine clearance transients in closed-loop mode showed the system was able to track clearances to within a tight tolerance (0. 001 in. error) ...|$|R

In the tire factory, the tire and wheel are mounted on a balancing machine test wheel, the assembly is accelerated up to a speed of 100 RPM (10 to 15 mph with recent high sensitivity sensors) or higher, 300 RPM (55 to 60 mph with typical low sensitivity sensors), and forces of unbalance are measured by sensors as the tire rotates. These forces are resolved into static and couple values for {{the inner and outer}} planes of the wheel, and compared to the unbalance tolerance (the maximum allowable manufacturing limits).
