5|$|Based <b>on</b> <b>current</b> fossil {{evidence}} from dinosaurs such as Oryctodromeus, some ornithischian species {{seem to have}} led a partially fossorial (burrowing) lifestyle. Many modern birds are arboreal (tree climbing), and this was also true of many Mesozoic birds, especially the enantiornithines. While some early bird-like species may have already been arboreal as well (including dromaeosaurids such as Microraptor) most non-avialan dinosaurs seem to have relied on land-based locomotion. A good understanding of how dinosaurs moved {{on the ground is}} key to models of dinosaur behavior; the science of biomechanics, pioneered by Robert McNeill Alexander, has provided significant insight in this area. For example, studies of the forces exerted by muscles and gravity on dinosaurs' skeletal structure have investigated how fast dinosaurs could run, whether diplodocids could create sonic booms via whip-like tail snapping, and whether sauropods could float.|$|E

When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, all of legislative Route3 became part of the new NY10, which initially began at the New Jersey state line and ended in Saranac Lake. North of Albany, the route followed modern NY5, NY50, and NY9N through Schenectady and Saratoga Springs to reach the North Country at Lake George. Past this point, NY10 continued north on what is now US9, NY8, NY28, NY28N, and NY30 to Tupper Lake via Chestertown, Wevertown, North Creek, and Long Lake.

40|$|Subset <b>currents</b> <b>on</b> {{hyperbolic}} {{groups were}} introduced by Kapovich and Nagnibeda as a generalization of geodesic <b>currents</b> <b>on</b> hyperbolic groups, which were introduced by Bonahon {{and have been}} successfully studied {{in the case of}} the fundamental group π_ 1 (Σ) of a compact hyperbolic surface Σ. Kapovich and Nagnibeda particularly studied subset <b>currents</b> <b>on</b> free groups. In this article, we develop the theory of subset <b>currents</b> <b>on</b> π_ 1 (Σ), which we call subset <b>currents</b> <b>on</b> Σ. We prove that the space SC(Σ) of subset <b>currents</b> <b>on</b> Σ is a measure-theoretic completion of the set of conjugacy classes of non-trivial finitely generated subgroups of π_ 1 (Σ), each of which geometrically corresponds to a convex core of a covering space of Σ. This result was proved by Kapovich-Nagnibeda in the case of free groups, and is also a generalization of Bonahon's result <b>on</b> geodesic <b>currents</b> <b>on</b> hyperbolic groups. We will also generalize several other results of them. Especially, we extend the (geometric) intersection number of two closed geodesics on Σ to the intersection number of two convex cores on Σ and, in addition, to a continuous R_≥ 0 -bilinear functional on SC(Σ).
