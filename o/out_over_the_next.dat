5|$|The {{internal}} {{disputes between}} the McMahons led to Linda McMahon {{being in a}} comatose and wheel-chair bound state due to the stress of being asked for a divorce by Vince, who {{took the opportunity to}} have a public affair with Trish Stratus. McMahon briefly feuded with Stratus, defeating her at No Way <b>Out.</b> <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> few weeks, Vince {{made it clear that he}} favored McMahon over Stratus, allowing McMahon to bully and verbally abuse Stratus. At WrestleMania X-Seven, Shane McMahon defeated Vince in a street fight. During the match, Stratus slapped Vince and chased Stephanie from ringside, apparently upset with Vince's constant misogynistic treatment of her.|$|E
5|$|Davidson {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for New South Wales during the 1949–50 season while the Test players were overseas, and took 26 wickets for the summer, earning him selection in an Australian Second XI tour of New Zealand at the season's end. During a non-first-class match on tour, he took 10/29 in an innings and made 157 not <b>out.</b> <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> two seasons, Davidson {{was unable to}} gain a regular position in the state team due {{to the presence of}} the Test players, but in 1952–53 he secured a position in the full-strength team and took 41 wickets at 26.75 and scored 418 runs at 34.83 to earn national selection for the 1953 tour of England. He played in all five Tests in the Ashes series, finishing the series with a modest return of 182runs at 22.75 and eight wickets at 26.50. He also scored his maiden first-class century during the tour. His fledgling international career stagnated over the next three years. Although Davidson was selected in the squad for the next four series, he suffered several injuries and inconsistent form, playing in only 7 of 19 Tests during this time, and taking only 8 wickets. Up to this point, he had played 12 Tests, none of them Australian victories. His individual performances were also unimpressive despite his first-class success, producing only 317runs at 18.64 and 16 wickets at 34.06.|$|E

5|$|Revolt {{began to}} stir in St Albans in Hertfordshire late on 13 June, when news broke {{of the events}} in London. There had been long-running {{disagreements}} in St Albans between {{the town and the}} local abbey, which had extensive privileges in the region. On 14 June, protesters met with the Abbot, Thomas de la Mare, and demanded their freedom from the abbey. A group of townsmen under the leadership of William Grindecobbe traveled to London, where they appealed to the King for the rights of the abbey to be abolished. Wat Tyler, then still in control of the city, granted them authority in the meantime to take direct action against the abbey. Grindecobbe and the rebels returned to St Albans, where they found the Prior had already fled. The rebels broke open the abbey gaol, destroyed the fences marking out the abbey lands and burnt the abbey records in the town square. They then forced Thomas de la Mare to surrender the abbey's rights in a charter on 16 June. The revolt against the abbey spread <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> few days, with abbey property and financial records being destroyed across the county.|$|E

The Mayflower Terrace was replaced by temporary, unreserved seating with a capacity of 3,500. A new state-of-the-art public address system was installed, and the last of ground's iconic floodlight towers were dismantled after 54 years of service, with a new system put in its place. The capacity of the ground was therefore reduced by roughly two thousand to 19,500 following these changes.|$|E

25|$|The Energy Policy Act of 2005, {{passed in}} the U.S. House of Representatives, {{did not include a}} {{provision}} for shielding MTBE manufacturers from water contamination lawsuits. This provision was first proposed in 2003 and had been thought by some to be a priority of Tom DeLay and Rep. Joe Barton, then chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. This bill did include a provision that gives MTBE makers, including some major oil companies, $2 billion in transition assistance while MTBE was phased <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> nine years. Due to opposition in the Senate, the conference report dropped all MTBE provisions. The final bill was passed by both houses and signed into law by President Bush. The lack of MTBE liability protection is resulting in a switchover to the use of ethanol as a gasoline additive.|$|E

500|$|Continuing land {{reclamation}} {{and control of}} the Parrett was a long-running cycle of neglect followed by improvement. Work was carried out on the upper River Parrett basin in the Middle Ages by Glastonbury Abbey. Abbot Michael's survey of 1234 showed [...] of meadow recovered around the [...] "island" [...] of Sowy; from the accounts in the Abbey's rent books, this had increased to [...] by 1240. Flooding of adjacent moor land was partially addressed in the 13th century by building a number of embankment walls to contain the Parrett. These included Southlake Wall, Burrow Wall and Lake Wall. The River Tone was also diverted by the Abbot of Athelney and other land owners into a new embanked channel, joining the Parrett upstream from its original confluence. After the dissolution of the monasteries in the 16th century, much of the former abbey lands came {{under the control of the}} Crown, particularly King's Sedgemoor, which had been wholly owned by Glastonbury Abbey, with Henry VI's Courts of Sewers made responsible for maintaining existing drainage and various Commissions made responsible for land improvements. Further reclamation work was carried <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> 500years. In 1597, [...] of land were recovered near the Parrett estuary; a few years later [...] near Pawlett were recovered by means of embankments; three further reclamations, totalling , were undertaken downstream of Bridgwater by 1660. Kings James I, Charles I, and Charles II continued to improve King's Sedgemoor.|$|E
