500|$|Every so often, I’d get a {{call from}} the {{producer}} saying, it’s going out at this time. The publicity people would be alerted, then we’d {{get a call}} saying no, it’s not, it’s been put back. That happened six times, I think, altogether – seven reschedules in a year or so... It was extraordinary and inexplicable, and just one <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> happen. I mean, a lot of shows are left on people’s desks and they hardly get seen, and Joking Apart was certainly one of those. Meanwhile, they were making about four series of The Brittas Empire, and you thought, [...] "Bloody Hell! Come on, surely….?" [...] To my mind, our show was a very superior product, and it upset me that other shows, which I, personally, felt were broader and less interesting, were getting precedence.|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the songs}} on the album seem {{to be based on}} the {{pressures}} of fame and dealing with the resulting loss of privacy. These include [...] "Not for You", [...] "Pry, To", [...] "Corduroy", [...] "Bugs", [...] "Satan's Bed", and [...] "Immortality". Vedder said, [...] "I'm just totally vulnerable. I'm way too fucking soft for this whole business, this whole trip. I don't have any shell. There's a contradiction there, because that's probably why I can write songs that mean something to someone and express some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> other people can't necessarily express." [...] The lyrics of [...] "Not for You" [...] express anger at the bureaucracy of the music industry and [...] "how youth is being sold and exploited," [...] while Vedder said [...] "Corduroy" [...] is about [...] "one person's relationship with a million people." [...] In [...] "Pry, To" [...] the phrase [...] "P-r-i-v-a-c-y is priceless to me" [...] is repeated. Many think that the lyrics of [...] "Immortality" [...] may be about Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain's suicide, although Vedder has denied this, suggesting instead that it's about [...] "the pressures on someone who is on a parallel train." [...] The lyrics that appeared in the first live version of [...] "Immortality" [...] were altered before the song was released as part of the album. Vedder said regarding [...] "Nothingman" [...] that [...] "if you love someone and they love you, don't fuck up...'cause you are left with less than nothing." [...] "Better Man" [...] is a song about an abusive relationship. Vedder wrote [...] "Better Man" [...] when he was in high school and performed it with his previous band, Bad Radio. Considered a [...] "blatantly great pop song" [...] by producer Brendan O'Brien, Pearl Jam was reluctant to record it and had initially rejected it from Vs. due to its accessibility.|$|E
500|$|Earlier {{that year}} Witherspoon {{was chosen to}} portray June Carter Cash, the second wife of country music singer-songwriter Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix), in Walk the Line. She never {{had the chance to}} meet Carter Cash, as Witherspoon was filming Vanity Fair at the time Carter Cash died. Witherspoon {{performed}} her own vocals in the film and her songs had to be performed in front of a live audience, she was so worried about needing to perform live that she asked her lawyer to terminate the film contract. [...] "That was the most challenging part of the role," [...] she later recalled in an interview, [...] "I'd never sung professionally." [...] Subsequently, she had to spend six months learning how to sing for the role. Witherspoon's portrayal of Carter Cash was well received by critics, and Roger Ebert wrote that her performance added [...] "boundless energy" [...] to the movie. She won several awards for her performance, including the Golden Globe Award, the Screen Actors Guild, the BAFTA and the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Lead Role. Besides critical success in the movie industry, Witherspoon and Phoenix received a nomination for [...] "collaborative video of the year" [...] from the CMT Music Awards. Witherspoon expressed her passion for the movie: [...] "I really like in this film that it is realistic and portrays sort of a real marriage, a real relationship where there are forbidden thoughts and fallibility. And it is about compassion in the long haul, not just the short easy solutions to problems." [...] She also stated that she believed Carter Cash was a woman ahead of her time: [...] "I think the really remarkable thing about her character is that she did all <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> we sort of see as normal things in the 1950s when it wasn't really acceptable for a woman to be married and divorced twice and have two different children by two different husbands and travel around in a car full of very famous musicians all by herself. She didn't try to comply to social convention, so I think that makes her a very modern woman." ...|$|E

And she gave me a little notebook in which I started to write things down and I still have." ...|$|E

It's unique. It's his. There are no other ones like that." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Europe, one of {{the first}} {{mentions}} of gunpowder use appears in a passage found in Roger Bacon's Opus Maius of 1267 and Opus Tertium in what has been interpreted as being firecrackers. The most telling passage reads: [...] "We have an example <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> (<b>that</b> act on the senses) in [...] that children's toy which is made in many [...] parts of the world; i.e., a device no bigger than one's thumb. From the violence of that salt called saltpeter [...] so horrible a sound is made by the bursting of a thing so small, no more than a bit of parchment , that we find [...] exceeding the roar of strong thunder, and a flash brighter than the most brilliant lightning." [...] In the early 20th century, British artillery officer Henry William Lovett Hime proposed that another work tentatively attributed to Bacon, Epistola de Secretis Operibus Artis et Naturae, et de Nullitate Magiae contained an encrypted formula for gunpowder. This claim has been disputed by historians of science including Lynn Thorndike, John Maxson Stillman and George Sarton and by Bacon's editor Robert Steele, both in terms of authenticity of the work, and with respect to the decryption method. In any case, the formula claimed to have been decrypted (7:5:5 saltpeter:charcoal:sulfur) is not useful for firearms use or even firecrackers, burning slowly and producing mostly smoke. However, if Bacon's recipe is taken as measurements by volume rather than weight, a far more potent and serviceable explosive powder is created suitable for firing hand-cannons, albeit less consistent due to the inherent inaccuracies of measurements by volume. One example of this composition resulted in 100 parts saltpeter, 27 parts charcoal, and 45 parts sulfur, by weight.|$|E

50|$|After {{listening}} to his account of his nocturnal travels to Hell, the judges became concerned as to whether Thiess was a devout Lutheran or not, and so {{asked him if he}} attended church regularly, listened to God's word, regularly prayed and partook of the Lord's Supper.

60|$|Norgate {{descended into}} the Strand and walked briskly towards Pall Mall. The {{last few minutes}} seemed to him to be fraught with promise of a new {{interest}} in life. Yet it was not of any <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> he was thinking {{as he made his}} way towards his destination.

60|$|It was not, however, {{to speak}} <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> I remembered The Amateur and its lessons. My {{intention}} was but to {{lead up to}} the story of a certain small boy, who in the doing of tasks not required of him was exceedingly clever. I wish to tell you his story, because, as do most true tales, it possesses a moral, and stories without a moral I deem to be but foolish literature, resembling roads that lead to nowhere, such as sick folk tramp for exercise.|$|E
6000|$|... (6.) The {{dependence}} {{that all}} the creatures have upon God; they teach thee to depend on him that made thee; yea, and will in the judgment condemn thee for thy unlawful practices, and dealings for thy preservation. The young ravens seek their food from God (Psa 147:9; Job 38:41), and will condemn thy lying, cheating, overreaching, defrauding, and the like. They provide neither storehouse, nor barn (Luke 12:24); but thou art so greedy <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> <b>that</b> thou for them shuttest thyself out {{of the kingdom of}} heaven (Prov 17:16).|$|E
60|$|The {{net result}} <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> was <b>that,</b> for perhaps half a minute, Ashe behaved absurdly. He goggled and he yammered.

60|$|Yet it {{was none}} <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> filled him with {{greatest}} wonder--no, it was the figures of the two creatures that had captured him and brought him hither.

Hanging by their knees from this perch, their heads downward and their bodies wrapped in their huge wings, slept the creatures of the night before--like two great, horrid bats they hung, asleep.|$|E

60|$|The {{system we}} have {{advocated}} {{is a form}} of Guild Socialism, leaning more, perhaps, towards Anarchism than the official Guildsman would wholly approve. It is in the matters that politicians usually ignore-- science and art, human relations, and the joy of life --that Anarchism is strongest, and it is chiefly for the sake <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> we included such more or less Anarchist proposals as the ``vagabond's wage.'' It is by its effects outside economics and politics, {{at least as much as}} by effects inside them, that a social system should be judged. And if Socialism ever comes, it is only likely to prove beneficent if non- economic goods are valued and consciously pursued.|$|E
