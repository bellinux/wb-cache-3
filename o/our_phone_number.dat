[...] David Jacoby, chief operating officer for the resort, said during construction that, [...] "This whole place has been very specifically feng shui'd, from the color patterns, to the carpets, to where the seats are, to where the cash is.

40|$|Abstract—This paper proposes Flow Permissions, an {{extension}} to the Android permission mechanism. Unlike the existing per-mission mechanism our permission mechanism contains semantic information {{based on information}} flows. Flow Permissions allow users to examine and grant explicit information flows within an application (e. g., a permission for reading the <b>phone</b> <b>number</b> and sending it over the network) as well as implicit information flows across multiple applications (e. g., a permission for reading the <b>phone</b> <b>number</b> and sending it to another application already installed on the user’s <b>phone).</b> <b>Our</b> goal with Flow Permissions is to provide visibility into the holistic behavior of the applications installed on a user’s <b>phone.</b> <b>Our</b> evaluation compares our approach to dynamic flow tracking techniques; our results with 600 popular applications and 1, 200 malicious applications show that our approach is practical and effective in deriving Flow Permissions statically.
