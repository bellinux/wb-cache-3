The same is true for the electromagnetic form factors This undoubtedly proves the existence of three-body forces, though the contribution of relativistic origin does not exhaust, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> contributions. The same relativistic dynamics should generate four-body forces, etc. Since in nuclei the small binding energies (relative to the nucleon mass) result from cancellations between the kinetic and potentials energies (which are comparable with nucleon mass, and, hence relativistic), the relativistic effects in nuclei are noticeable. Therefore, many-body forces should be taken into account for fine tuning to experimental data.|$|E

Nas said of the collaboration in an interview [...] "I was a big fan of his father and <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> children, all the offspring, and Damian, I kind of looked at Damian as a rap guy. His stuff is not really singing, or if he does, it comes off more hard, like on some street shit. I always liked how reggae and hip-hop have always been intertwined and always kind of pushed each other, I always liked the connection. I'd worked with people before from the reggae world but when I worked with Damian, the whole workout was perfect". A portion of the profit was planned to go towards building a school in Africa. He {{went on to say that}} it was [...] "too early to tell the title or anything like that". The Los Angeles Times reported that the album would be titled Distant Relatives.|$|E
