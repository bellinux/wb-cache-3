5|$|During {{the earlier}} Northern and Southern dynasties (420–589), {{and perhaps even}} earlier, the {{drinking}} <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> (Camellia sinensis) became popular in southern China. Tea was viewed then as a beverage of tasteful pleasure and with pharmacological purpose as well. During the Tang dynasty, tea became synonymous with everything sophisticated in society. The poet Lu Tong (790–835) devoted most of his poetry to his love <b>of</b> <b>tea.</b> The 8th-century author Lu Yu (known as the Sage <b>of</b> <b>Tea)</b> even wrote a treatise {{on the art of}} drinking tea, called The Classic <b>of</b> <b>Tea.</b> Although wrapping paper had been used in China since the 2nd century BC, during the Tang dynasty the Chinese were using wrapping paper as folded and sewn square bags to hold and preserve the flavor <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> leaves. Indeed, paper found many other uses besides writing and wrapping during the Tang era.|$|E

5|$|Although {{each type}} <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> has {{different}} taste, smell, and visual appearance, tea processing for all tea types {{consists of a}} very similar set of methods with only minor variations. Without careful moisture and temperature control during its manufacture and life thereafter, fungi will grow on tea. This form of fungus causes real fermentation that will contaminate the tea and may render the tea unfit for consumption.|$|E

5|$|Rolling / Shaping:The damp {{tea leaves}} are then rolled to be formed into {{wrinkled}} strips, by hand or using a rolling machine which causes the tea to wrap around itself. This rolling action also causes {{some of the}} sap, essential oils, and juices inside the leaves to ooze out, which further enhances {{the taste of the}} tea. The strips <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> can then be formed into other shapes, such as being rolled into spirals, kneaded and rolled into pellets, or tied into balls, cones and other elaborate shapes. In many types of oolong, the rolled strips <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> leaf are then rolled to spheres or half spheres and is typically done by placing the damp leaves in large cloth bags, which are then kneaded by hand or machine in a specific manner. The tea can also be pressed into bricks through the use of heavy stones or presses.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally, Darjeeling teas are {{classified}} as a type <b>of</b> black <b>tea.</b> However, the modern Darjeeling style employs a hard wither (35-40% remaining leaf weight after withering), which in turn causes an incomplete oxidation for many <b>of</b> the best <b>teas</b> <b>of</b> this designation, which technically makes them a form of oolong. Many Darjeeling teas also {{appear to be a}} blend <b>of</b> <b>teas</b> oxidized to levels of green, oolong, and black.|$|R
5|$|Tea is {{the second}} most {{consumed}} beverage in the world, after water. Argo was founded in response to a realization that Americans had so few tea offerings that they generally were unfamiliar with anything but bagged teas. At the time, most tea retailers either supplied bulk tea for home brewing or traditional sit-down service, but Argo focused on premium specialty drinks in paper cups. Meanwhile, a minority of Asian immigrants from countries such as India, Vietnam and China where tea is the national beverage were spreading some of their traditions. Argo endeavored to emphasize the healthy aspects <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> as an alternative to coffee. When it was founded, Argo was part of a field of blossoming tea cafe franchises meeting a burgeoning demand. By 2002, there were 1,100 tearooms with sit-down service. In 2003, retail sales <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> totaled $5.1billion, and in 2005, as the specialty tea market was growing 20percent per year, the total retail tea market was expected to surpass $10 billion by 2010.|$|E

This relationship followed a twelve-year union Fanning had had with his previous girlfriend, {{and it was this}} break-up (along with the then-recent death of his older brother) which influenced much of the lyrical content and sombre atmospheric mood <b>of</b> <b>Tea</b> & Sympathy. Through Moreno, Fanning has learned to speak some of the Spanish language. Fanning and Moreno have performed together while Powderfinger was on hiatus and Fanning was touring as a solo artist.|$|E
5|$|From {{its base}} in India, the Company {{had also been}} engaged in an {{increasingly}} profitable opium export trade to China since the 1730s. This trade, illegal since it was outlawed by the Qing dynasty in 1729, helped reverse the trade imbalances resulting from the British imports <b>of</b> <b>tea,</b> which saw large outflows of silver from Britain to China. In 1839, the confiscation by the Chinese authorities at Canton of 20,000 chests of opium led Britain to attack China in the First Opium War, and resulted in the seizure by Britain of Hong Kong Island, at that time a minor settlement.|$|E
