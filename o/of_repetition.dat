5|$|Unlike ASL, BASL {{allows for}} the {{frequent}} use of syntactic repetition. In {{a study conducted by}} McCaskill, of 26 signers (13 Black and 13 White), Black signers had 57 instances <b>of</b> <b>repetition</b> compared to 19 from White signers, and of those 19 instances, 18 were made by a single signer.

5|$|Finally {{revealed}} to be a ghost story inspired by nineteenth-century French fantasy literature, the film uses the conventions of the genre —that people who die in emotional distress or with an unfinished task may become ghosts— and openly details these conventions. Marie and Adrienne's 'lives' as revenants are reduced to a single purpose, each with only {{the memory of her}} suicide and her last emotions remaining. Julien, like the audience, is eventually confronted with Marie's nightmare <b>of</b> <b>repetition.</b> Elements of the horror genre are used, not to scare but to explore memory and loss. To stay with Marie, Julien first has to forget about her, and at the end they have the promise of a new beginning. Marie becomes a living person again rather than an object of fantasy. Marie's tears and blood are a miracle overcoming her death, and may reflect a fantasy of turning back the menopause. The credits are accompanied by an upbeat jazz song performed by Blossom Dearie, Our Day Will Come, that represents love as a pledge, the only music used in the film.|$|E
5|$|Further complicating {{this picture}} are {{repetition}} patterns. There {{are two types}} <b>of</b> <b>repetition</b> in Rapanui words: double syllables within roots, as in mamari, and grammatical reduplication of disyllables, as seen in rongorongo. In the Rapanui lexicon, double syllables as in mamari are 50% more likely than chance can explain. However, in the rongorongo texts, analogous double AA glyphs are only 8% more likely than chance. Similarly, in the Rapanui lexicon reduplicated disyllables such as rongorongo are seven times as common as chance, constituting {{a quarter of the}} vocabulary, whereas, in rongorongo texts, ABAB sequences are only twice as likely as chance, and 10% of the vocabulary. If rongorongo is a phonetic script, therefore, this discrepancy needs to be explained. Pozdniakov suggests that perhaps there was a 'reduplicator' glyph, or that modifications of glyphs, such as facing heads to the left rather than to the right, may have indicated repetition.|$|E
25|$|Visual {{extinction}} {{has also}} been researched {{with regard to the}} effect <b>of</b> <b>repetition</b> on visual detection rate. Patients were shown a colored (red or green) letter (O or E), one to each visual field, and then asked variably to report the color or shape of one letter or the other. Extinction was found to be increased in the contralesional field when the patient was asked to report on a repeated characteristic – if both stimuli had been the same shape, or same color – regardless of whether the other characteristic had also been changed. This is another example <b>of</b> <b>repetition</b> blindness.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the effect of {{different}} rest intervals (RI) between sets on number <b>of</b> <b>repetitions,</b> sustainability <b>of</b> <b>repetitions,</b> and total volume during a leg press exercise. Seventeen resistance-trained older women (68. 0 ± 5. 9 years, 71. 2 ± 11. 7 kg, 1. 58 ± 0. 07 m) participated in the study. All participants performed three sets to voluntary exhaustion, with loads that corresponded to 15 maximum repetitions, in two experimental sessions (that ranged from 48 to 72 hours apart). In each session, one of two RI (one-minute: RI- 1 and three minute: RI- 3) was tested, employing a randomized and counterbalanced design. For both RI, significant reductions (p < 0. 05) were observed in the number <b>of</b> <b>repetitions</b> and sustainability <b>of</b> <b>repetitions,</b> from the first to the second and third sets. Differences (p < 0. 05) between the RI also were observed in the two final sets. The total volume for the RI- 3 session was statistically higher (29. 4 %, p < 0. 05) as compared to the RI- 1 session. The length of the RI between sets influenced the number <b>of</b> <b>repetitions,</b> sustainability <b>of</b> <b>repetitions,</b> and total volume. The longer RI should be used, therefore, when the goal of training is to increase the total volume...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to understand teleoanticipation throughout various resistance training sets using the Rating of Perceived Exertion (WE) scales. Methods: Twenty-one Inen performed four sets for bench press and leg press consisting <b>of</b> a 5 <b>repetition</b> maximum (RM), lORM, 20 RM, and 30 RM. RPE was measured after each repetition. Results: The results showed that regardless of the number <b>of</b> <b>repetitions</b> completed, RPE increased throughout each set in a linear fashion. When normalized to the relative number <b>of</b> <b>repetitions,</b> RPE had scalar properties, and there was a strong correlation between RPE and repetitions. Conclusion: This study reinforced that the RPE scale can be used to measure intensity during resistance training. Since RPE was strongly correlated to the relative number <b>of</b> <b>repetitions,</b> this suggests that teleoanticipation occurs during resistance training as in aerobic training. Regardless of the number <b>of</b> <b>repetitions,</b> the brain recruits the anticipated muscle fibers and develops a pacing strategy in order to complete the task at hand...|$|R

25|$|In {{cases of}} acute AOS (stroke), {{spontaneous}} recovery may occur, in which previous speech abilities reappear on their own. All other cases of acquired AOS require {{a form of}} therapy; however the therapy varies with the individual needs of the patient. Typically, treatment involves one-on-one therapy with a speech language pathologist (SLP). For severe forms of AOS, therapy may involve multiple sessions per week, which is reduced with speech improvement.

25|$|During {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s Frank Stella was a {{significant}} figure {{in the emergence of}} Minimalism, Post-Painterly Abstraction and Color Field painting. His shaped canvases of the 1960s like Harran II, 1967, revolutionized abstract painting. One of the most important characteristics of Stella's paintings is his use <b>of</b> <b>repetition.</b> His Black Pin Stripe paintings of 1959 startled and shocked an art world that was unused to seeing monochromatic and repetitive images, painted flat, with almost no inflexion. During the early 1960s Stella made several series' of notched Aluminum Paintings and shaped Copper Paintings before making multi-colored and asymmetrical shaped canvases of the late 1960s. Frank Stella's approach and relationship to Color Field painting was not permanent or central to his creative output; as his work became more and more three-dimensional after 1980.|$|E

The context of the movement should also be noted; this means that a movement could be triggered in a certain posture, while at rest, during action, or during a specific task. The movement’s quality can also be described in observing whether or not the movement can be categorized as a normal movement by an unaffected individual, or one that is not normally made on a daily basis by unaffected individuals.|$|E

25|$|Inconsolable Memories (2005) {{is based}} on Tomas Gutierrez Alea's film Memorias del subdesarrollo (Memories of Underdevelopment) from 1968, updated to include {{references}} to the Mariel boatlift of 1980.

Some of the photographs reference the locations used in the original Alea film tying together the themes of history and memory. At issue is the utopian promise of the Cuban revolution and its decline, and as well, the parallel Cold War events of the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 (examined in Alea's film) and the boatlift of 1980.|$|E
500|$|Repetition was a {{convention}} used often on Sesame Street.

INTRODUCTION Spontaneous speech is notorious for its false starts, um's and er's, pauses, fragments, self-repairs, and repeated words. Disfluencies reveal information about the planning problems of the speaker [1, 6] and provide a challenge for speech processing [7].
