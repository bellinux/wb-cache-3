40|$|We present two {{examples}} from the cusp ionosphere over Svalbard, where poleward moving auroral forms (PMAFs) are causing significant phase scintillation in signals from navigation satellites. The data were obtained {{using a combination of}} ground-based optical instruments and a newly installed multiconstellation navigation signal receiver at Longyearbyen. Both events affected signals from GPS and Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS). When one intense PMAF appeared, the signal from one GPS spacecraft also experienced a temporary loss of <b>signal</b> <b>lock.</b> Although several polar cap patches were also observed in the area as enhancements in total electron content, the most severe scintillation and loss of <b>signal</b> <b>lock</b> appear to be attributed to very intense PMAF activity. This shows that PMAFs are locations of strong ionospheric irregularities, which at times may cause more severe disturbances in the cusp ionosphere for navigation signals than polar cap patches...|$|R

In 1894 the company was reorganized and renamed the Slaymaker-Barry Company with Samuel Slaymaker as the principal stock holder, and John Barry and William F Troast as junior partners.

40|$|Strong ionospheric {{electron}} content gradients {{may lead}} to fast and unpredictable fluctuations in the phase and amplitude of the signals from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). This phenomenon, known as ionospheric scintillation, is capable of deteriorating the tracking performance of a GNSS receiver, leading to increased phase and Doppler errors, cycle slips and also to complete losses of <b>signal</b> <b>lock.</b> In order to mitigate scintillation effects at receiver level, the robustness of the carrier tracking loop, the receiver weakest link under scintillation, must be enhanced. Kalman Filter (KF) based tracking algorithms are particularly suitable {{to cope with the}} variable working conditions imposed by scintillation. However, the effectiveness of this tracking approach strongly depends on the accuracy of the assumed dynamic model, which can quickly become inaccurate under randomly variable situations. This study first shows how inaccurate dynamic models can lead to a KF suboptimum solution or divergence, when both strong phase and amplitude scintillation are present. Then, to overcome this issue, it proposes two self-tuning KF based carrier tracking algorithms, which self-tune their dynamic models by exploiting the knowledge about scintillation that can be achieved through scintillation monitoring. The algorithms have been assessed with live equatorial data affected by strong scintillation. Results show that the algorithms are able to maintain the <b>signal</b> <b>lock</b> and provide reliable scintillation indices when classical architectures and commercial ionospheric scintillation monitoring receivers (ISMRs) fail...|$|R

30|$|In recent years, the {{interest}} of the scientific community in studying ionospheric irregularities has increased. Small-scale irregularities produce amplitude and phase scintillation, which can degrade transionospheric signals and can influence the performance of space communication radio systems (Forte and Radicella, 2004; Stankov and Jakowski, 2007; Rama Rao et al., 2009). It is very important to estimate scintillation and phase fluctuation effects on the GNSS navigation system (GPS/GLONASS) performance and, consequently, on the precession of the obtained position. Large-scale irregularities, and associated TEC fluctuations, can complicate phase ambiguity resolution, increase the number of undetected and uncorrected cycle slips and losses of <b>signal</b> <b>lock</b> in GNSS (Wanninger, 1995; Jakowski et al., 2005; Wielgosz et al., 2005).|$|R

The Global Positioning System (GPS) {{is used for}} this positional awareness. However, due to missile rotation and orientation variations during flight, GPS signal reception using traditional antennas may be intermittent. To remain cost competitive, Stellar Exploration Inc. is developing a low-cost omnidirectional GPS antenna for guided missile prototypes. In this thesis, existing products and design techniques are examined, design constraints for supersonic missile applications are investigated, and corresponding performance goals are established. A conformal microstrip patch antenna is developed and simulated in Agilent’s Advanced Design System (ADS). The resulting antenna is constructed and characterized. Prototype testing verifies that the antenna maintains GPS <b>signal</b> <b>lock</b> regardless of orientation. The final cost is significantly lower than existing conformal products.

40|$|Scintillations are rapid {{fluctuations}} in the phase and amplitude of transionospheric radio signals which are caused by small-scale plasma density irregularities in the ionosphere. In {{the case of the}} Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers, scintillation can cause cycle slips, degrade the positioning accuracy and, when severe enough, can even lead to a complete loss of <b>signal</b> <b>lock.</b> Thus, the required levels of availability, accuracy, integrity and reliability for the GNSS applications may not be met during scintillation occurrence; this poses a major threat to a large number of modern-day GNSS-based applications.
