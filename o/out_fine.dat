Several times during her career she took the risk to leave established shows for new productions where she had more influence, like her move from the well established heute journal to the heute nacht news show. Her daily lifestyle magazine Leute heute became very successful after it was at first less popular than expected and in 1995 the 2000th episode was shown. Ruge finished nearly every edition of her show Leute heute with the quote Alles wird gut (Everything will turn <b>out</b> <b>fine)</b> which became her trademark and which she also used for some of her book titles. In November 2006 Ruge announced to end her work for Leute heute on 3 February 2007 in order to have more time for her private life.|$|E
25|$|The {{composition}} of the English side for the first Test at Old Trafford caused some controversy. Lancashire County Cricket Club, the ground authority, originally selected their captain A N Hornby to captain England. However, Hornby injured his leg, and Allan Steel was chosen to captain England in his stead. 10,000 attended on the first day, which, although dull and overcast in the morning, turned <b>out</b> <b>fine</b> {{in the afternoon and}} gave the English bowlers little assistance. Australia were on 181 when the fifth wicket fell. However, the last five wickets went down for 24 runs. At close of play on the first day, England were 36 for the loss of WG Grace's wicket. By lunch on the second day, after some slow scoring, England were 140 for 5. After lunch, George Ulyett and Johnny Briggs were swiftly sent back to the pavilion. George Lohmann, who was dropped with only a single to his name, however, went on to make 32 and take the England total to 223. By {{the end of the second}} day, Australia were 36 runs to the good, with six second innings wickets remaining. On the third and final day, Australia, on a crumbling wicket, were only able set England 106 to win. England lost Grace, Shrewsbury and Read early for only 24 runs, and the Australians were always threatening. But in the end England got home with 4 wickets to spare at 5.40pm Later Dick Barlow was presented with a silk scorecard of the match in honour of his 68 runs and 7 for 44 for England.|$|E

500|$|Mandela {{was widely}} {{considered}} a charismatic leader, described by biographer Mary Benson as [...] "a born mass leader {{who could not}} help magnetizing people". He was highly image conscious and throughout his life always sought <b>out</b> <b>fine</b> quality clothes, with many commentators believing that he carried himself in a regal manner. His aristocratic heritage was repeatedly emphasised by supporters, thus contributing to his [...] "charismatic power". While living in Johannesburg in the 1950s, he cultivated {{the image of the}} [...] "African gentleman", having [...] "the pressed clothes, correct manners, and modulated public speech" [...] associated with such a position. In doing so, Lodge argued that Mandela became [...] "one of the first media politicians [...] embodying a glamour and a style that projected visually a brave new African world of modernity and freedom".

The film's end credits piece, [...] "They'll Remember You", is an original composition, but the lyrics {{were based on the}} poem [...] "Wanderer's Nightsong" [...] by German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. An end piece entitled [...] "Long Live Sacred Germany" [...] was inspired by Adagio for Strings, in the sense it would not feel like film music tailored to every moment in the scene, but still fit with what was going on. Ottman described the original version of the track as a [...] "three minute drone that I slowed down with these two Tuvan throat singers, the whole thing was this horribly dark, morbid piece [...] left you cold". Ottman composed a metallic motif for Hitler, which was formed by low strings and a piano cluster.|$|E

Shamrock stated {{in his autobiography}} that he was uncomfortable fighting Taktarov, as Oleg trained with the Lion's Den {{and he did not}} wish to injure his friend and teammate. In Beyond the Lion's Den, Shamrock states; [...] "In addition to being his friend, I was also trying to get him into Pancrase and if I broke his leg it would be a while before he could recover and he needed the money. I figured my best chance of winning without seriously hurting him was to beat on him with punches... If I could open a cut and get him to start pouring blood, I could get a referee stoppage. It might not have been the best plan going into a fight, but considering the options it seemed like the best option available. And it turned <b>out</b> <b>fine.</b> I battered him around {{for the duration of the}} match, the bout was declared a draw and when Oleg recovered he went on to fight in Pancrase." ...|$|E
2500|$|Francesco Maria Piave was to {{be engaged}} to write the new {{libretto}} {{and the two men}} tried {{to come up with a}} suitable subject, but the composer complained that his librettist [...] "had not yet offered him an 'original' or 'provocative' idea". Writing to Piave, he added that [...] "I don't want any of those everyday subjects that one can find by the hundreds." [...] But at the same time, the composer expressed concern about censorship in Venice, something with which he was very familiar after his dealings with the censors concerning Rigoletto. As the months dragged on into October, it was agreed that Piave would come to Sant'Agata and work with the composer. One subject was chosen, Piave set to work, and then Verdi threw in another idea, which may have been La traviata. However, within a short time, a synopsis was dispatched to Venice under the title of Amore e morte (Love and Death). However, as Budden reveals, Verdi writes to his friend De Sanctis telling him that [...] "for Venice I'm doing La Dame aux camélias which will probably be called La traviata. A subject for our own age." [...] Although still bogged down at Sant'Agata, Piave was sanguine: [...] "Everything will turn <b>out</b> <b>fine,</b> and we'll have a new masterpiece from this true wizard of modern harmonies".|$|E

Whatever on earth he had done it for he could not now tell. The old doctor who held the chair in that department had thirty years before earned the name of Crab. And slowly in the succeeding years he had grown crabbier, crustier, so student rumor had it. Ken had rather liked the dry old fellow, and had been much absorbed in his complex lectures, but he had never been near him, and now the prospect changed color. Foolishly Ken asked a sophomore in what light old Crab might regard a student who was ambitious to pass his exams early. The picture painted by that sophomore would have made a flaming-mouthed dragon appear tame. Nerving himself to the ordeal, Ken took his card and presented himself one evening at the doctor's house.|$|E

6000|$|We {{have found}} <b>out</b> <b>fine</b> names to cover our sensuality withal, but no gifts can raise intemperance. The man of talent affects {{to call his}} transgressions {{of the laws of}} the senses trivial and to count them nothing {{considered}} with his devotion to his art. His art never taught him lewdness, nor the love of wine, nor the wish to reap where he had not sowed. His art is less for every deduction from his holiness, and less for every defect of common sense. On him who scorned the world as he said, the scorned world wreaks its revenge. He that despiseth small things will perish by little and little. Goethe's Tasso is very likely to be a pretty fair historical portrait, and that is true tragedy. It does not seem to me so genuine grief when some tyrannous Richard the Third oppresses and slays a score of innocent persons, as when Antonio and Tasso, both apparently right, wrong each other. One living after the maxims of this world and consistent and true to them, the other fired with all divine sentiments, yet grasping also at the pleasures of sense, without submitting to their law. That is a grief we all feel, a knot we cannot untie. Tasso's is no infrequent case in modern biography. A man of genius, of an ardent temperament, reckless of physical laws, self-indulgent, becomes presently unfortunate, querulous, a [...] "discomfortable cousin," [...] a thorn to himself and to others.|$|E
