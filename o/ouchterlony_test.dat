It had a sedimentation coefficient of approximately 3 S and a mol. wt determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in presence of SDS was approximately 37, 000 daltons. In the <b>Ouchterlony</b> <b>test,</b> it was antigenically deficient as compared with intact thyroglobulin, when rabbit antisera to human thyroglobulin were used. With human autoantisera, fraction 2 did not show any precipitin reaction in the <b>Ouchterlony</b> <b>test.</b> However, it produced weak inhibition in the tanned cell haemagglutination test. The fractions obtained from trypsin and papain digestion appeared to be immunologically identical. However, when these fractions were compared with the similar product obtained from reduced and alkylated thyroglobulin, the latter fraction showed a reaction of non-identity in the <b>Ouchterlony</b> <b>test,</b> and had a weaker inhibiting capacity in tanned cell haemagglutination test. The fraction produced by reduction and alkylation had a sedimentation coefficient of 8 S and an approximate mol. wt of 38, 500. It can be concluded that the small mol. wt fractions derived from enzymatic breakdown and by reduction and alkylation are different although both possess a number of antigenic determinants recognized by the rabbit antiserum and lack most of the autoantigenic determinants...|$|E

Eichmann and Kindt (8), however, recently reported strong cross-reactions among the antistreptococcal antibodies {{of some of the}} rabbits of a family group. These rabbits were descended from a brother-sister mating pair {{selected on the basis of}} production of antibodies of limited heterogeneity in response to streptococcal cell wall antigens. There is evidence that idiotypic cross-reactions may be more frequent among mice of an inbred strain than among rabbits. Cohn et al. (9) prepared antiidiotypic antibodies in an A/J mouse against a BALB/c myeloma protein with antibody-like activity against pneumococcal C carbohydrate. Antisera to C carbohydrate prepared in 6 of 10 normal BALB/c mice formed precipitates with the antiidiotypic antiserum in the <b>Ouchterlony</b> <b>test.</b> The intensities of the precipitin lines were weaker with the cross-reacting sera than with the myeloma protein used as immunogen and lines of identity were not demonstrated. In addition, idiotypic cross-reaction was noted with another myeloma protein with anti-C carbohydrate activity.

40|$|Myeloma {{proteins}} (1) and antibodies {{from individual}} animals (2, 3) {{have been shown}} to possess individually specific or "idiotypic " (4) antigenic determinants. For example, anti-salmonella antibodies from an individual rabbit have determinants that are not detectable in other immunoglobulins of that rabbit nor, ordinarily, in antibodies of the same specificity from other rabbits (3). Quantitative studies have shown that various fractions (up to 80 %) of purified anti-benzoate antibodies, designated D (5), from a given donor rabbit are reactive with anti-idiotypic (anti-D) antisera (6, 7). Precipitin lines in the <b>Ouchterlony</b> <b>test</b> were obtained when as little as 2 % of the donor (D) population was precipitable. Our present investigations indicate that the reactions of anti-p-azobenzoate antibodies (D) with their anti-idiotypic antisera are strongly inhibited by benzoate derivatives, i. e. by specific haptens, whereas the reactions of D with anti-Fab antibodies are affected to a much smaller extent.

40|$|Bibliography: pages [104]- 106. Polyclonal {{antibodies}} {{have been}} produced against {{the components of the}} Xenopus laevis jelly coat. <b>Ouchterlony</b> <b>tests</b> have shown that polyclonal antibodies react with the ‘jelly coat antigens, producing three distinct bands. In contrast to the polyclonal antibodies, the monoclonal 51 -A antibody taken from ascities fluid, produced one distinct band. These <b>Ouchterlony</b> <b>tests</b> have also shown that the polyclonal antibodies react against homogenized embryos, thereby indicating that there may be some homology between the components of the jelly coat and the embryo. On the other hand, the monoclonal antibody does not react with any of the embryonic components. This study has also shown that polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies react with the jelly coats of intact embryos. The characteristics of the jelly coat were changed to a degree whereby the treated embryos were unable to hatch. The jelly coat had become opaque and appeared to have a rubbery texture. The epidermis of intact and dejellied embryos also appear to be affected by these antibodies. Preliminary studies at the ultrastructural level (not reported in the results) show dissociated tight junctions of the epidermis. The [¹⁴C] glycine and [¹⁴C] alanine uptake studies of these jelly coat dependent amino acids indicate that the polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies reduce these amino acids' transport into the embryo. In this study, [¹⁴C] lysine appeared to be transported independently of the jelly coat. When [¹⁴C] lysine uptake was tested, the results indicated no reduction in the amino acid's transport into the embryo. The uptake of this amino acid was reduced in embryos treated with antibodies to the jelly coat. These results have clearly demonstrated that the prior treatment of jelly coats with these antibodies reduces the uptake of those amino acids which {{have been shown to be}} jelly coat and sodium dependent for their transport.

NAG-rTDH was purified by successive column chromatographies on DEAE-cellulose and an immunoaffinity column coupled with anti-Vp-TDH immunoglobulin. The molecular weight of NAG-rTDH was estimated as 18, 500, similar to that of Vp-TDH, as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate slab gel electrophoresis, but its charge or molecular shape was different, judging from its electrophoretic mobility. The lytic activities of NAG-rTDH on erythrocytes of most animals were essentially similar to those of Vp-TDH, but that on sheep erythrocytes was different. The hemolytic activity of NAG-rTDH was stable on heating at 100 degrees C for 10 min, as was that of Vp-TDH. Immunological cross-reactivity between NAG-rTDH and Vp-TDH was demonstrated by both the <b>Ouchterlony</b> <b>test</b> and the neutralization test.

40|$|In {{order to}} reveal the {{conformational}} changes in holo- and apo-forms of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) the differences in immunogenicity of these forms have been studied by immunochemical techniques. A panel of polyclonal antibodies (PcAb) specific to holo- and apo-HRP was tested by double immunodiffusion (<b>Ouchterlony</b> <b>test)</b> to find the antisera which distinguish the structural changes in peroxidase molecule after heme removal.

We found most epitopes established for holo-HRP, but some of them were shifted by one-two amino acids. At the same time we revealed several new epitopes specific only for apo-HRP. Some of epitopes placed close to the active site were specific only for holo-HRP. The increased amount of antigenic epitopes established for apo-HRP and partial shifts in their location mean certain conformational changes in peroxidase molecule in a result of heme removal.

The excellent correlation of the amounts of epoxide hydnolase determined catalytically on immunochemically (r = 0. 99) indicated that inter-individual variation in octene oxide hydration rates by human liver microsomes is a consequence of differences in amount of epoxide hydrolase protein which is present, and not the result of differences in levels of endogenous modulators of catalytic activity...|$|E

In shift experiments from 14 C-leucine to 12 C-leucine medium, the kinetics of disappearance of labeled supernatant ribosome proteins (as measured by reaction with antibody) indicated that half the pool is depleted in 0. 1 generation time at 37 C in glucose-salts medium. The pool was also depleted under conditions of amino acid starvation of a “relaxed” strain which accumulated “relaxed” particles.

Polyclonal rabbit antisera raised against these isolates and standard GBS typing sera were used in capillary precipitation and Ouchter-lony tests to compare the strains with known GBS serotype reference strains. All three previously nontypeable isolates reacted with all three new antisera, producing lines of identity in the <b>Ouchterlony</b> <b>test.</b> Weak cross-reactions with antisera against several GBS serotypes were observed but were removed by absorption with corresponding antigens. The new antisera were used to test 227 GBS isolates that had been nontypeable or difficult to type using standard antisera. Of these, five reacted with the new antisera. These results suggested that all eight isolates belong to the previously unrecognized GBS serotype.

Two segments of the cps gene cluster (3 end of cpsE-cpsF and 5 end of cpsG, approximately 700 bp; 3 end of cpsH and 5 end of cpsM, approximately 560 bp) were sequenced. All eight isolates expressed C, and seven expressing the C protein and the corresponding genes, bca and bac, respectively, were identified. They all share the same, unique partial cps sequence.

40|$|Antisera {{have been}} {{prepared}} against two electrophoretically homogeneous “polypeptide chain elongation factors,” T and G, from Escherichia coli. Inactivation and precipitation tests showed that these two fractions were antigenically distinct with no cross-reaction. The immune inactivation curve of G factor from E. coli was distinguishable from that of G factor from Pseudomonas fluorescens. Mammalian factors were not inhibited by antibody directed against the E. coli T and G factors. By <b>Ouchterlony</b> diffusion <b>tests,</b> the antisera also detected significant antigenic variability among different bacterial species. It is concluded that the factors have undergone considerable evolutionary divergence in their antigenic structure...|$|R
40|$|Oral vaccine against {{streptococcus}} {{infection in}} yellowtail Seriola quinqueradiata is already commercialized, however the vaccine has disadvantageous property that much amount {{is necessary to}} induce enough efficacy. One of the proposed reasons for it is that antigenicity of the administrated antigen is decreased while it passes the stomach of fish. Present study is conducted to develop encapsulated vaccine to protect antigen from the effect of stomach. Firstly, culture and inactivation conditions of the bacterium Lactococcus garvieae were examined to get highly antigenic cells. L. garvieae S− 2433 strain was cultured with and without shaking in brain heart infusion broth. Antigenicity was determined by agglutination using antisera against two types of L. garvieae. Antigenicity was also determined after inactivation with various concentrations of formalin and by heating at different temperatures. Encapsulation of vaccine {{was carried out by}} the method of mixing acetone dissolution of cellulose acetate phthalate to antigen dispersed in paraffin oil. Confirmation of encapsulation of the antigen was carried out using Ouchterlony immunodiffusion test. The highest agglutination of the bacterium was found when it was cultured 9 - 12 h with shaking at 30 ℃. High antigenicity of the bacterium is shown when it was inactivated with 0. 2 % formalin or by heating for 30 min at 100 ℃. The diameter of the capsule preparation ranged 30 - 70 μm, showing spherical body. The result of <b>Ouchterlony</b> <b>test</b> showed that the antigen was encapsulated and the encapsulated antigen was released at neutral pH but not at low pH. Thus, a possibility that this enteric-coated microcapsule is available for the development of new oral vaccine...|$|E
40|$|Paragonimiasis {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{parasitic}} disease in Japan. It has however, never been reported in northern Japan above Aomori prefecture, including Hokkaido. We reported the first case of cerebral paragonimiasis infested in Hokkaido. An 8 -year-old boy has had serial episodes of focal and generalized convulsions since he was 2 years 8 months old. He used to catch crabs (Eriocheir japonocus) in Ishikari river and eat them after roasting. He had no previous history of severe headache, vommiting or high fever. On admission, he was alert and orientated. His mentality measured by WISC-R was almost within normal limits. He showed no cranial nerve palsy, motor weakness, sensory impairment, cerebellar signs or other neurological deficits. Hematological data showed no abnormality except for mild eosinophilia. Immunological examinations for the paragonimiasis, such as skin test, complement fixation test, <b>ouchterlony</b> <b>test</b> and antibody titer assaid by ELISA, were all negative. Skull X-ray and CT scan demonstrated prominent characteristic multiple intracerebral calcifications, ranging from 10 to 30 mm in diameter, and each calcification consisted of a clustering of smaller cystic types, which resembled so called "soap bubbles". EEG and cerebral angiography demonstrated no significant abnormalities. His convulsions were well controlled by anticonvulsants. Although serum immunological tests were negative, cerebral paragonimiasis was strongly suspected on the basis of his history of eating crabs and characteristic radiological findings. In cerebral paragonimiasis, as an ectopic parasitism of the Paragonimus species, it is usually difficult to find eggs or adult worms in the feaces or sputum, serum immunological tests are also not always positive, especially in the chronic stage. Analyses of our case indicated that there may be another paragonimus infection in Hokkaido and a survey should be carried out for the detection of the metacercariae of Paragonimus in Eriocheir japonicus or crayfish...|$|E
40|$|It is {{only about}} three years since it was first {{recognized}} explicitly that there are separate genes for the various immunoglobulin heavy chains that distinguish the heavy chain classes. At the 1964 Cold Spring Harbor meeting, evidence for the close linkage of these genes was presented for man (Kunkel et al., 1964) and the mouse (Herzenberg, 1964). We then reported that the two genes for a 7 G-globulin and ~A-globulin marked by allelic antigenic differences or allotypes did not recombine in 78 backcross animals tested, indicating quite close linkage. Further, on examining the alleles for the two loci in some 80 inbred strains of mice we found a complete association between yA and ~G alleles except {{in a few cases}} where there was too little serum ~A to detect the allotype by the relatively less sensitive <b>Ouchterlony</b> <b>test</b> then being used. When we employed the more sensitive in-hibition of 11 ~ 5 labeled antigen precipitation (Herzenberg et al., 1965), complete association was observed (Herzenberg and Warner, 1967). The mouse allotypic antigens on ~,G and yA are localized to the respective Fc fragments (Mishell and Fahey, 1964). They are distinct and generally non-cross-reacting for the two classes. This is {{in sharp contrast to the}} rabbit H chain allotypes which are associated with the Fd fragments and are quite similar (cross-reacting) for vA and yG as well as VM (Oudin, 1966). Soon after the discovery of Ig- 1 and Ig- 2, Lieberman and Potter, and we added a third gene, Ig- 3, coding for the H chain of ~G~b-immuno-globulin to the H chain gene cluster, again using antigenic or allotypic markers for the genetic scor-ing (Lieberman et al., 1965; Herzenberg, unpubl.). Close to 2, 000 progeny have now been tested be-tween both laboratories without a single crossover having been found, indicating that the map distance between any two elements tested is less than 0. 1 centiMorgan (map unit). For the other two recognized H chain classes of mouse immunoglobulins neither we nor, to our knowledge, anyone else has been able to find allotype differences by serological methods. There-fore we turned to other approaches to show geneti...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} shown by agar {{precipitin}} <b>tests</b> (<b>Ouchterlony</b> and Oakley) that human sera may contain from 0 to 5 antibodies against antigens present in a partially purified streptolysin O preparation, and from 0 to 7 antibodies against antigens in a crude ammonium sulfate concentrate of the streptococcal culture supernate used. These antigens were prepared from a Group A hemolytic streptococcus (strain C 203 S). Strong evidence was presented suggesting {{that some of the}} bands seen with streptolysin O concentrate represented antibody reponses to streptococcal antigens heretofore undescribed. Tests were also carried out with other streptococcal antigens, including streptokinase-desoxyribonuclease mixture from Group C streptococci (varidase-Lederle), crystalline proteinase, proteinase precursor, C carbohydrate, and sonic vibrated streptococcal cell extracts (group A, C 203 S). Fewer bands were seen with these preparations, and with some they were quite uncommon. The observations indicated that the predominating antibody responses in human streptococcal infections were to extracellular products of the micro-organisms, and only very slightly and infrequently to intracellular antigens. The human sera studied included sera from patients with active or convalescent rheumatic fever, and non-rheumatic subjects suffering from a variety of illnesses. As was expected, the rheumatic subjects showed antibody responses to many more of the antigens present in these preparations than did the nonrheumatic group. Pooled normal human gamma globulin was found to contain many of the antibodies found in potent human sera. This finding confirmed the antigen-antibody nature of the bands seen with individual sera. The epidemiological significance of these findings with gamma, globulin was briefly discussed. It was found that rabbit, guinea pig, and human antibody precipitin bands join quite readily in the <b>Ouchterlony</b> <b>tests.</b> This finding adds another tool for the identification of the precipitin bands found with human sera. Evidence was obtained which indicated differing immunological specificities of two samples of streptococcal desoxyribonuclease, one from Group A, the other from a Group C streptococcus. The value of these technics as representing a new approach to the study of human infectious disease was discussed...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{initiated}} {{to look for}} characteristics of the immunodominant antigen(s) of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) that might help explain the high antibody titers reactive with this organism in periodontitis patients. Radioimmunoassays (RIA) and limiting dilution analysis on western blots were used to identify and characterize the immunodominant antigens of Aa in high responder patients (i. e. patients with high antibody titers). Additional experiments focused on specific responding subjects {{with a range of}} antibody titers to serotype b (AaY 4). This group included both white and black subjects. Similar studies then examined the immunodominant antigens of Aa serotypes a and c. The Aa serotype specificity of the high responders was determined and further work was confined to individuals responding specifically to serotypes a or c. The results indicated that the immunodominant antigen of Aa Y 4 in all high responders was heat and papain stable. Limiting dilution analysis on western blots showed that a large diffuse band resembling carbohydrate was the immunodominant antigen. Partially purified AaY 4 carbohydrate also contained the large diffuse band. Double immunodiffusion (<b>Ouchterlony)</b> <b>tests</b> indicated that the dominant antigen recognized in the carbohydrate extract by the patients 2 ̆ 7 sera was the same antigen recognized by serotype b specific rabbit antiserum which has been previously shown to react with the serotype specific carbohydrate of AaY 4.

40|$|Donaldson, D. M. (Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah), R. S. Jensen, B. M. Jensen, and A. Matheson. Serological {{relationships}} among β-lysin, plakin, and leukin. J. Bacteriol. 88 :– 1049 1055. 1964. —β-Lysin is a substance {{which has been}} separated from normal serum and which is bactericidal {{for a variety of}} gram-positive bacteria including Bacillus subtilis. Purified β-lysin is not denatured at 97 C for 15 min. The bactericidal activity of six of nine β-lysin preparations was unaltered at 97 C for 30 min and was depressed 50 % in the other three preparations. After 120 min at 97 C, the bactericidal activity was between 13 and 25 % of normal. β-Lysin was completely inactivated at 120 C for 15 min. Antisera prepared in guinea pigs against purified rabbit β-lysin neutralized the bactericidal activities of purified β-lysin, normal rabbit serum, platelet extracts, and purified plakin. This serological relationship between β-lysin and plakin was also demonstrated by the observation that antisera against platelets neutralized the bactericidal activities of serum, platelet extracts, and purified β-lysin. When anti-β-lysin serum was tested against crude bactericidal extracts of leukocytes and purified leukin, no neutralization of these bactericidal substances was measurable. The results of this study are in accord with conclusions made in previous studies that platelets are a primary source of serum β-lysin and that leukocytes contribute little, if any, to this type of serum bactericidal activity. <b>Ouchterlony</b> <b>tests,</b> in combination with the neutralization studies, indicated that the antigen-antibody system involved in the neutralization of β-lysin may be a nonprecipitating system...|$|R
