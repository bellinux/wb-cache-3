In June 2013, the character {{appeared in}} the climax of Age of Ultron #10, which was also written by Brian Michael Bendis. Though mostly set in the mainstream Marvel universe, or Earth-616 {{as it is known}} in dialogue, the story depicts major changes to the space-time continuum {{as a result of the}} time travel on the part of characters, resulting in Miles witnessing the coming <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> Marvel Galactus, an entity that consumes planets, to Earth.|$|E
5|$|Djajakusuma often {{included}} traditional arts in his films, {{and two of}} them (Lahirnja Gatotkatja and Bimo Kroda) {{were based}} on traditional wayang stories and used wayang-inspired costumes and tempos. This focus on aspects of traditional culture fell out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> after 1965, having been replaced by films about city life. Djajakusuma's theatrical productions experimented with new storytelling techniques, adapting the traditional styles for the modern world. As a lecturer teaching screenwriting and the history of theatre, Djajakusuma focused on Indonesian arts. He argued that Indonesians should rely on local culture, not continuously look towards the West. In other areas he was mostly apolitical.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s, James Bond movies, bomba (soft porn) {{pictures}} and {{an era of}} musical films, produced mostly by Sampaguita Pictures, dominated the cinema. The second golden age occurred from 1970s to early 1980s. It was during this era that filmmakers ceased to produce pictures in black and white. A rise in Hollywood films dominated theater sales during the late 1980s until the 2000s. The dawn of this era saw a dramatic decline <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> Philippine movie industry. In the year 2009, however, presence of box-office films in the Philippine Box Office has surged. The mid 2010s also saw broader commercial success of films produced by independent studios.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this study}} is to examine the {{cognitive}} errors as predictor of quality of life of mainstreamed elementary students. Quality <b>of</b> life is <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> well-being felt by an individual. The functional deficiencies, which occur due to physical, cognitive, sensory, emotional disorders, affect <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individuals. In this study, it is aimed to analyze the cognitive errors as <b>the</b> predictor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstreamed</b> students. <b>The</b> sample <b>of</b> <b>the</b> research was composed of 117 <b>mainstreamed</b> students (46 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students are female and 71 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students are male) selected by random sampling method who attend from first to fifth classes of a school under <b>the</b> control <b>of</b> Ministry of National Education in <b>the</b> academic year <b>of</b> 2007 - 2008 in Turkey, Samsun.

5|$|Heterodox economists {{adhere to}} {{theories}} sufficiently {{outside the mainstream}} to be marginalized and treated as irrelevant by the establishment. Initially, heterodox economists including Joan Robinson, worked alongside mainstream economists, but heterodox groups isolated themselves and created insular groups in the late 1960s and 1970s. Present day heterodox economists often publish in their own journals rather than those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> and eschew formal modeling {{in favor of more}} abstract theoretical work.|$|E
5|$|Since the Mantra-Rock Dance {{brought the}} Hare Krishna {{movement}} to the wider attention of the American public, Prabhupada's increased popularity attracted the interest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> media.

Prabhupada's followers also spoke about their activities on the San Francisco radio station KFRC.|$|E

5|$|The {{distinctness}} of the Donegal tradition developed due to {{the close}} relations between Donegal and Scotland, and the Donegal repertoire and style has influences from Scottish fiddle music. For example, {{in addition to the}} standard tune types such as Jigs and Reels, the Donegal tradition also has Highlands (influenced by the Scottish Strathspey). The distinctiveness of the Donegal tradition led to some conflict between Donegal players and representatives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> tradition when Irish traditional music was organised in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The {{establishment}} of Christianity from {{the sixth century}} brought Latin to Scotland as a scholarly and written language. Monasteries served as major repositories of knowledge and education, often running schools and providing a small, educated and overwhelmingly male, elite, who were essential to create and read documents in a largely illiterate society. Literary life revolved around the contemplation of texts and the copying of manuscripts. Libraries were of great importance to monastic communities. The one at Iona may have been exceptional, but it demonstrates that the monks were part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> of European Christian culture.|$|E
5|$|By 2017, {{the series}} had sold over 8.5 million units worldwide, outselling even its parent Megami Tensei franchise, which has sold over 7.2 million since its inception. The first Persona was {{referred}} to {{at the time as}} a sleeper hit, and the success of it and Eternal Punishment helped establish both Atlus and Megami Tensei in North America. In Europe, the series did not become established prior to the release of Persona 3 and 4, both of which were highly successful in the region. According to Atlus CEO Naoto Hiraoka, the main turning point for the franchise was the release of Persona 3, which was a commercial success and brought the series to the attention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> gaming community. Persona 4 received an even better reception. The Persona series' success has allowed Atlus to build a strong player base in the West, contributing to the success of other titles such as Catherine.|$|E

5|$|Ideas {{about the}} {{transmutation}} of species {{were associated with}} the radical materialism of the Enlightenment and were attacked by more conservative thinkers. Cuvier attacked the ideas of Lamarck and Geoffroy, agreeing with Aristotle that species were immutable. Cuvier believed that the individual parts of an animal were too closely correlated with one another to allow for one part of the anatomy to change in isolation from the others, and argued that the fossil record showed patterns of catastrophic extinctions followed by repopulation, rather than gradual change over time. He also noted that drawings of animals and animal mummies from Egypt, which were thousands of years old, showed no signs of change when compared with modern animals. The strength of Cuvier's arguments and his scientific reputation helped keep transmutational ideas out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> for decades.|$|E
5|$|The {{new school}} of hip hop was a {{movement}} in hip hop music starting 1983â€“84 with the early records of Runâ€“D.M.C. and LL Cool J. Like the hip hop preceding it, it came predominantly from New York City. The new school was initially characterized in form by drum machine led minimalism, often tinged with elements of rock. It was notable for taunts and boasts about rapping, and socio-political commentary, both delivered in an aggressive, self-assertive style. In image as in song its artists projected a tough, cool, street b-boy attitude. These elements contrasted sharply with the funk and disco influenced outfits, novelty hits, live bands, synthesizers and party rhymes of artists prevalent in 1984, and rendered them old school. New school artists made shorter songs that could more easily gain radio play, and more cohesive LPs than their old school counterparts. By 1986 their releases began to establish the hip hop album as a fixture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1949, the Federation of Independents (VdU) {{was founded}} as a {{national}} liberal alternative to the main Austrian partiesthe Social Democratic Party (SPÃ–) and the Austrian People's Party (Ã–VP), successors to the interwar era Marxist and Christian Social parties. The VdU was founded by two liberal Salzburg journalistsformer Nazi Germany prisonerswho wanted to stay clear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> socialist and Catholic camps and feared that hostility following the hastily devised postwar denazification policy (which did not distinguish between party members and actual war criminals) might stimulate a revival of Nazism. Aiming to become a political home to everyone {{not a member of}} the two main parties, the VdU incorporated an array of political movementsincluding free-market liberals, populists, former Nazis and German nationalists, all of whom had been unable to join either of the two main parties. The VdU won 12% of the vote in the 1949 general election, but saw its support beginning to decline soon afterward. It evolved into the FPÃ– by 1955/56 after merging with the minor Freedom Party in 1955; a new party was formed on 17 October 1955, and its founding congress was held on 7 April 1956.|$|E

5|$|In the Early Medieval era most {{evidence}} of religious practice comes from monks and is heavily biased towards monastic life. From {{this can be}} seen the daily cycle of prayers and the celebration of the Mass. There was also the business of farming, fishing and in the islands, seal hunting. Literary life revolved around the contemplation of texts and the copying of manuscripts. Libraries were of great importance to monastic communities. The one at Iona may have been exceptional, but it demonstrates that the monks were part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> of European Christian culture. Less well recorded, but as significant, was the role of bishops and their clergy. Bishops dealt with the leaders of the tuath, ordained clergy and consecrated churches. They also had responsibilities for the poor, hungry, prisoners, widows and orphans. Priests carried out baptisms, masses and burials. They also prayed for the dead and offered sermons. They anointed the sick with oil, brought communion to the dying and administered penance to sinners. Early local churches were widespread, but since they were largely made of wood, like that excavated at Whithorn, the only evidence that survives for most is in place names that contain words for church, including cill, both, eccles and annat, but others are indicated by stone crosses and Christian burials. Beginning on the west coast and islands and spreading south and east, these were replaced with basic masonry-built buildings.|$|E
