50|$|Pulmonary {{hemorrhage}} (or pulmonary haemorrhage) is {{an acute}} {{bleeding from the}} lung, from the upper respiratory tract and the trachea, and the alveoli. When evident clinically, the condition is usually massive. The onset of pulmonary hemorrhage is characterized by cough productive of blood (hemoptysis) and worsening of oxygenation leading to cyanosis. Treatment should be immediate and should include tracheal suction, <b>oxygen,</b> <b>positive</b> pressure ventilation, and correction of underlying abnormalities (e.g. disorders of coagulation).

40|$|Neurogenic {{pulmonary}} edema {{is a life}} threatening complication of severe central nervous system injury. The {{most common cause of}} neurogenic {{pulmonary edema}} is subarachnoid hemorrhage followed by head trauma and epilepsy. The rare causes are cervical spine trauma, multiplesclerosis, cerebellar hemorrhage and intracranial tumors. Neurogenic pulmonary edema is characterized by an increase in extravascular lung water in patients who have sustained a sudden change in neurologic condition. The exact pathophysiology is unclear but it probably involves an adrenergic response to the central nervous system injury which leads to increased catecholamine, pulmonary hydrostatic pressure and increased lung capillary permeability. The presenting symptoms are nonspecific and often include dyspnea, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypoxemia, pinkfroty secretion, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and crackles. These symptoms start within minutes or hours and resolves 48 - 72 hours that typically for neurogenic pulmonary edema.

40|$|Chronic {{lung disease}} (CLD), {{formerly}} known as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, is presently defined {{as the need for}} oxygen therapy either at 28 days of age or greater than 36 weeks postmenstrual age. Clini-cal signs and symptoms include tachypnea, retractions, apnea, and radiographic findings of poorly in-flated lungs with reticulogranular opacities. The disease develops as a result of chronic pulmonary in-flammation and continuous lung injury induced by <b>oxygen,</b> <b>positive</b> pressure ventilation, and other causes. Fifty to sixty-five percent of neonates with CLD are rehospitalized with respiratory problems, and 21 % of very low birth weight neonates are diagnosed with asthma or other respiratory disorders by the age of five. These infants are at risk of adverse neurodevelopmental sequelae as they have a more complicated neonatal course. Many studies have explored various preventive therapies including α 1 -proteinase inhibitors, superoxide dismutase, antioxidants, and ventilatory management. Although the results from these trials are promising, further studies are needed to define which patients are most likely to benefit from preventive therapy.

40|$|Introduction: Acute {{heart failure}} (AHF) is {{characterized}} by inadequate cardiac output (CO), congestive symptoms, poor peripheral perfusion and end-organ dysfunction.

We tested the effects of half-molar sodium lactate infusion on cardiac performance in AHF. Methods: We conducted a prospective, randomised, controlled, open-label, pilot clinical trial in 40 patients fulfilling two of the following three criteria for AHF: (1) left ventricular ejection fraction < 40 %, (2) acute pulmonary oedema or respiratory failure of predominantly cardiac origin requiring mechanical ventilation and (3) currently receiving vasopressor and/or inotropic support. Patients in the intervention group received a 3 ml/kg bolus of half-molar sodium lactate over the course of 15 minutes followed by 1 ml/kg/h continuous infusion for 24 hours. The control group received only a 3 ml/kg bolus of Hartmann's solution without continuous infusion. The primary outcome was CO assessed by transthoracic echocardiography 24 hours after randomisation. Secondary outcomes included a measure of right ventricular systolic function (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE)), acid-base balance, electrolyte and organ function parameters, along with length of stay and mortality.
