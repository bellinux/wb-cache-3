40|$|Os pacientes com artrite idiopática juvenil (AIJ) podem apresentar alterações no metabolismo ósseo e no crescimento esqueletal, além de danos na articulação {{temporomandibular}} (ATM), o que pode gerar alterações extraorais e/ou intraorais, acarretando distúrbios craniofaciais. Nosso objetivo é promover uma revisão da literatura sobre as alterações orofaciais em pacientes com AIJ. Dentre os distúrbios orofaciais em pacientes com AIJ, as mudanças no crescimento mandibular, geradas por disfunções na região da ATM, parecem de grande prevalência nesses pacientes. As alterações mais encontradas são: retrognatismo, micrognatia, mordida aberta anterior, apinhamento dentário, assimetria facial e limitação de abertura de boca. Assim, o reumatologista torna-se uma peça-chave na detecção precoce dessas disfunções, ajudando no encaminhamento do paciente ao dentista. O diagnóstico, por sua vez, deve ser realizado pelo ortodontista, utilizando exames clínico e de imagem, o que possibilita tratamento precoce e prognóstico favorável. Distúrbios na ATM devem ser tratados de forma multidisciplinar, incluindo tratamento farmacológico para o controle da dor e tratamento odontológico por meio de aparelhagem funcional e/ou ortodôntica, fisioterapêutico e por vezes fonoaudiológico. Concluímos que dentre os distúrbios orofaciais em pacientes com AIJ, as mudanças no crescimento mandibular geradas por disfunções na região da ATM parecem de grande prevalência. Tais disfunções podem promover, principalmente, mordida aberta, retrusão mandibular, micrognatia, apinhamento dentário e assimetria facial. O reumatologista pode detectar tais alterações precocemente, encaminhando o paciente de imediato a uma equipe que deve ser, preferencialmente, multidisciplinar, composta por ortodontista, fisioterapeuta e fonoaudiólogo, visando reduzir futuras complicações oclusais e de crescimento mandibular. Patients with {{juvenile idiopathic arthritis}} (JIA) {{can have}} alterations in bone metabolism and skeletal growth, as well as damage to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), which can generate extra and/or intraoral alterations, resulting in craniofacial disorders. Our goal is {{to carry out a}} review of the literature on orofacial alterations in patients with JIA. Among the <b>orofacial</b> <b>disorders</b> in patients with JIA, alterations in mandibular growth, caused by dysfunctions in the TMJ region, seem highly prevalent in these patients. The most often found alterations are: retrognathia, micrognathia, anterior open bite, dental crowding, facial asymmetry and mouth opening limitation. Thus, the rheumatologist becomes a key agent in the early detection of these disorders, helping with patient referral to a dentist. The diagnosis, in turn, should be performed by the orthodontist, using clinical examination and imaging methods, allowing early treatment and a favorable prognosis. TMJ disorders should be treated by a multidisciplinary team, including pharmacological treatment for pain control and dental care through functional appliance and/or orthodontic therapy, physical therapy and sometimes, speech therapy. We conclude that among the <b>orofacial</b> <b>disorders</b> in patients with JIA, alterations in mandibular growth generated by dysfunctions in the TMJ region seem highly prevalent. Such dysfunctions can cause mainly open bite, mandibular retrusion, micrognathia, dental crowding and facial asymmetry.

MethodsPatients with poor dental occlusion (n= 89, 8 – 15 years) undergoing orthodontic treatment at the Postgraduate Orthodontics Center (São Paulo, Brazil) participated in the study. Rhinitis and oral breathing were diagnosed by anamnesis, clinical assessment and allergic etiology of rhinitis through immediate hypersensitivity skin prick test with airborne allergens. The association between types of breathing (oral or nasal), rhinitis and types of dental malocclusion, bruxism and cephalometric alterations (increased Y axis of facial growth) compared to standard cephalometric tracing (Escola de Odontologia da Universidade de São Paulo) were assessed. ResultsThe frequency of rhinitis in patients with dental malocclusion was 76. 4 % (68), and, of these, 81. 7 % were allergic (49 / 60 positive skin prick test), whereas the frequency of oral breathing was 62. 9 %.

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the effectiveness of hypoxic lip training for improving lip incompetence. Subjects and methods: Twenty healthy subjects (10 males and 10 females, 23. 6 +/- 2. 3 years old) with lip incompetence participated in this study. We recorded the sealed lip ratio calculated by using the formula "(lip-sealingtime/totalrecorded time) x 100 " during relaxation (listening to soothing music) and during concentration (performing a mathematical calculation). Then the subjects performed a standardized hypoxic lip training (5 repetitive contractions with 80 % of maximum tensile strength of the orbicularis oris muscle) with a traction plate. Training was repeated daily for 4 weeks. To estimate training effects, the sealed lip ratios during relaxation and concentration were recorded before training (T 1), at 2 weeks (T 2) and 4 weeks (T 3) after the start of training, and at 4 weeks (T 4) and 8 weeks (T 5) after the end of training. Results: The sealed lip ratios in both the relaxation and concentration conditions significantly (p < 0. 003 after Bonferroni correction) increased during the training period. Although the sealed lip ratios slightly decreased during the post-training period, they were not significantly different from those at T 3. Conclusions: Hypoxic lip training increases the sealed lip ratio and is thus effective for improving lip incompetence. Sealed lip ratios were maintained after 8 weeks of training.

40|$|The {{activation}} of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), expressed by peripheral sensory neurons, represents an innate surveillance function of sensory neurons with important consequences for neuronal function. Despite recent advances, many properties of neuronal TLRs remain poorly understood, particularly within the trigeminal system. The main objectives of this thesis, therefore, were to better characterise the expression and functional consequences of {{activation of}} neuronal TLRs {{in the setting}} of orofacial pain. A detailed, quantitative description of TLR 4, TLR 2 and TLR 7 expression within neurochemically- identified sub-populations of trigeminal ganglion (TG) sensory neurons suggests that these receptors are primarily expressed by nociceptor sub-populations. Acute activation of these TLRs, in TG neurons, induced an increased gene expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF and IL- 1. In an attempt to identify further novel co-modulators of neuronal TLR activation, the expression of lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT) isoforms, a phospholipid remodelling enzyme that is known to mediate TLR 4 activation in macrophages, are described within TG neurons. Under naïve conditions, LPCAT 1 was expressed by a range of sensory neuron sub-types whereas LPCAT 2 expression was confined to non-neuronal cells. Following nerve injury, the expression of LPCAT 2 was induced in a small proportion of TG neurons in vitro whilst the expression of LPCAT 1 remained unaltered. These results may support a role for LPCAT 2 in neuronal TLR activation following a priming stimulus, such as nerve injury. Taken together, the results presented in this thesis support the hypothesis that trigeminal nociceptors can directly detect and respond to pathogenic challenge and tissue damage. The acute activation of TLRs, expressed by trigeminal nociceptors, results in the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines which are known to activate and sensitise neurons. The activation of neuronal TLRs may therefore contribute to the increased neuronal excitability and pain that accompanies common <b>orofacial</b> <b>disorders...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To analyse {{the changes}} in gene {{expression}} in a population of human periodontal ligament (HPDL) cells exposed to cyclic tensile strain in a three dimensional culture system. Results: Cells derived from extracted teeth were shown to represent a mixed population with greater than 95 % of cells expressing markers characteristic of periodontal ligament fibroblasts with an oestobastic phenotype with a smaller sub-population (2 - 3 %) of stem cells. Cells from several different donors were subjected to an applied tensile strain (5 %) and compared to unstressed controls. RNA extracted immediately post-stress was analysed to determine changes in gene expression. Microarray data indicated a total of 164 genes responding to the applied strain, 38 % of which have no known function. qRT-PCR analysis of HAS 1, NR 4 A 2, FOS, INHBA, FOSL 2, RUNX 2, ATF 4, FOSL 1, SP 7, COL 1 A 1, COL 3 A 1, MMP 1, MMP 2, MMP 3 and TIMP 3 expression levels confirmed the microarray data. Further {{analysis of the data}} highlighted changes in expression of CLDN 4, BCOR, PROK 2 and INHBA genes known to be associated with inherited <b>orofacial</b> <b>disorders.</b> Conclusion: This study has shown that the periodontal ligament fibroblasts derived from extracted teeth and cultured in vitro in 3 D 'in-vivo-like' constructs can be induced to respond to mechanical stimuli. The molecular events detected in periodontal ligament cells subjected to cyclic tensile strain direct the cell population to remodel the entire periodontium (cells and matrices) in a process involving cell migration.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to evaluate voice characteristics of children engaged in street selling, which involves an essentially professional use of voice in this population. A controlled cross-sectional study was carried out. A randomly chosen sample of 200 school children with a history of street selling assisted by public social services and 400 school children without this experience was selected. Seven- to 10 -year-old children of both sexes were studied. Both groups were interviewed and given vocal assessment (auditory-perceptual assessment and spectrographic acoustic measures) and otorhinolaryngological evaluation (physical and videonasolaryngoscopic examination). Children with abnormal results in both groups were compared using chi(2) (Chi-squared test). the significance level was established at 5 % (P < 0. 05). Voice problems were detected more frequently in working children (106 - 53 %) than in regular school children (90 - 22. 5 %). the control group achieved better school performance as more children in this group attend school regularly than street children, although age-for-grade deficit was similar. the control group had more access to medical visits (80 - 40 %) and treatment with a doctor (34 - 17 %). Language assessment has shown that the control group had more dysphonia (73 - 37 %) and myofunctional <b>orofacial</b> <b>disorders</b> (20 - 10 %). Street children had more normal voice but had more nasal disorders and greater glottal closure than the school control group. Voice disorders were present in both groups, but less frequently in street children. Although subject to inadequate living conditions, street children had better voice quality than the control group. An explanation could be that by adapting their voice professionally for selling goods in the streets, they developed adequate resilience to their difficult living conditions.

Final commentaries: The wide range of causes involved in oral breathing requires an interdisciplinary team trained to identify such alterations, enabling preventive measures to be undertaken, in order to avoid alterations in the general health, regular development of the face, as well as in the nutritional status in these individuals' relevant growth stages...|$|R
40|$|To {{explore the}} use of patient {{reported}} quality of life measures in oral medicine, to highlight the importance of use of these measures in oral medicine practice and to provide guidance for the selection of such measures in the future. A detailed literature review was undertaken to investigate {{the use of}} quality of life measures in oral medicine. The databases searched were MEDLINE (through PubMed), EMBASE, CINDHL, Web of Science Citation Index and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and randomised controlled trials. The initial literature search yielded a total of 5310 citations; however, only 63 of these fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Twenty-two articles were regarding oral mucosal conditions, 14 related to <b>orofacial</b> pain <b>disorders</b> and 27 were regarding salivary gland-related conditions. The evaluation of {{quality of life in}} oral medicine has a broad applicability, providing information in treatment-based studies and population-based studies. A predominance of generic and oral health specific quality of life measures are being used to a limited extent in oral medicine practice. A scarcity of reports of the development, validation or use of disease specific measures is evident...|$|R

Orofacial pain (OFP) can arise from different regions and etiologies. Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are the most prevalent orofacial pain conditions for which patients seek treatment. Temporomandibular disorders include a number of clinical problems that involve the masticatory musculature, the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) or both. Trigeminal neuropathic pain conditions can arise from injury secondary to dental procedures, infection, neoplasias, or disease or dysfunction of the peripheral and/or central nervous system. Neurovascular disorders, such as primary headaches, can present as chronic orofacial pain, {{such as in the}} case of facial migraine, where the pain is localized in the second and third division of the trigeminal nerve. Together, these disorders of the trigeminal system impact the quality of life of the sufferer dramatically. A multidisciplinary pain management approach should be considered for the optimal treatment of <b>orofacial</b> pain <b>disorders</b> including both non-pharmacological and pharmacological modalities.

The {{main goal}} {{of this study was}} to investigate, using MEG, the dynamic neural mechanisms underlying facial tactile stimulation in two groups of subjects, namely a control group (without pain) and a TMD pain group (arthromyalgia), by stimulating the facial skin with a non-painful air-driven plastic membrane. Our first specific aim was to investigate and compare the spatial and temporal features of the ECDs following innocuous tactile stimuli in both groups. And t he second specific aim was to investigate the differences in dynamic brain function between these two groups using a time-frequency analysis of the MEG data. In summary, innocuous tactile stimulation proved to be a successful way to measure brain spatio-temporal dynamics in two group population. We were able to demonstrate very clear the differences in brain organization and dynamics between these two groups using an innocuous stimulus and without causing an unpleasant feeling. The results obtained allow for a paradigm shift in future research of brain mechanisms in pain by the use of non-painful tactile stimuli to evaluate brain function in various orofacial (or other) pain conditions, including neurovascular and neuropathic pains and other complex <b>orofacial</b> pain <b>disorders...</b>|$|R

Material e Métodos: Estes estudos caso-controle foram compostos por pacientes com FULP (selecionados no Hospital de Reabilitação de Anomalias Craniofaciais da Universidade de São Paulo ¿ HRAC/USP, Bauru, SP) sob o mesmo protocolo de tratamento, pareados por gênero e idade com os controles (selecionados de escolas públicas de Piracicaba, SP), totalizando 54 crianças de oito a dez anos de idade em cada grupo. O Estudo 1 utilizou as versões em Português Brasileiro do Nordic Orofacial Test-Screening (NOT-S) e do Child Perceptions Questionnaire (CPQ 8 - 10) para avaliar as funções orofaciais e a QVRSB, respectivamente. O Estudo 2 avaliou a presença e gravidade de maloclusões dos pacientes utilizando o Goslon Yardstick Index (GYI) e dos controles pelo Índice de Necessidade de Tratamento Ortodôntico ¿ Componente Dentário (IOTN). Em ambos os grupos foi avaliada {{a performance}} mastigatória utilizando alimento teste artificial (Optocal) e a percepção do paladar utilizando quatro soluções líquidas (doce, salgado, amargo e azedo) em três diferentes concentrações. A análise dos dados consistiu de estatística descritiva, testes de comparação e correlação e análise de regressão linear para verificar as variáveis independents associadas com os escores do NOT-S. Resultados: No Estudo 1, o grupo FULP apresentou maiores escores do NOT-S (4, 3 vs. 2, 8, p? 0, 0001), isto é, apresentaram mais frequentemente disfunções relacionadas à respiração, simetria/expressão facial e fala. O grupo FULP apresentou pouca diferença em relação a QVRSB do grupo controle, com maior comprometimento do domínio bem-estar social. Na análise de correlação, os escores do CPQ 8 - 10 estiveram positivamente correlacionados com os escores do NOT-S total e entrevista no grupo FULP. O estudo 2 verificou que mais de metade das crianças com FULP necessitavam de cirurgia ortognática (escore GYI = 5), enquanto 66, 7 % dos controles apresentou leve/pequena necessidade de tratamento (escore IOTN = 2), sendo que não houve associação entre a maloclusão e as disfunções orofaciais. O grupo FULP apresentou pior performance mastigatória (maiores valores do X 50 e valor de b) e menor percepção do sabor salgado do que os controles. Além disso, houve correlação positiva entre a disfunção orofacial e a performance mastigatória no grupo FULP. Na análise de regressão linear múltipla, também observou-se relação significativa entre a disfunção orofacial e a performance mastigatória. Conclusões: A presença de FULP foi associada com disfunções orofaciais, resultando no comprometimento dos aspectos sociais do dia a dia, além de acarretar prejuízos à oclusão, a performance mastigatória, percepção de paladar.;;Abstract:Objectives: To evaluate the orofacial functions and oral health-related {{quality of life}} (OHRQoL) and their associations (Study 1) and to assess the relation between orofacial dysfunctions with malocclusion, masticatory performance and taste in children with cleft lip and palate (UCLP) (Study 2). Material and Methods: Both case-control studies were composed by patients with UCLP (selected from the Hospital for Rehabilitation of Craniofacial Anomalies, University of São Paulo, Bauru, SP) under the same treatment protocol, matched by gender and age with controls (selected from public schools of Piracicaba, SP), totalling 54 eight- to ten year-old children in each group. Study 1 used the Brazilian Portuguese versions of the Nordic Orofacial Test-Screening (NOT-S) and the Child Perceptions Questionnaire (CPQ 8 - 10) to evaluate orofacial dysfunctions and OHRQoL, respectively. Study 2 evaluated the orthodontic treatment need of patients using the Goslon Yardstick Index (GYI) and controls using the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need ¿ Dental Health Component (IOTN-DHC). In both groups, masticatory performance was assessed by calculating the median particle size (X 50) and distribution of particles in different sieves (b value) with artificial food test (Optocal); and taste perception using four liquid solutions (sweet, salty, bitter or acid) in three different concentrations. Data analysis involved descriptive statistics, comparison and correlation tests and linear regression analysis to verify the independent variables associated with NOT-S scores. Results: In Study 1, the UCLP group had higher scores NOT-S (4. 3 vs. 2. 8, P? 0. 0001), ie, were more often disorders related to breathing, symmetry / facial expression and speech. The UCLP group showed little difference from QVRSB the control group, with greater involvement of the social well-being domain. In the correlation analysis, CPQ 8 - 10 scores were positively correlated with the scores of the total NOT-S and interview UCLP group. Study 2 The descriptive analysis showed that {{found that more than}} half of children with Fulp needed orthognathic surgery (GYI = 5 score), while 66. 7 % of the controls showed a slight / small need for treatment (IOTN score = 2), no association between malocclusions and <b>orofacial</b> <b>disorders.</b> In comparison analysis, UCLP group had higher scores NOT-S examination, that is, more often disorders related to breathing, symmetry / facial expression and speech. In addition, UCLP group reported greater involvement of the social welfare field than controls. The UCLP group had worse masticatory performance (higher values X 50 and value b) and lower perception of salty taste than controls. In the correlation analysis, CPQ 8 - 10 scores were positively correlated with the scores of the total NOT-S and interview UCLP group. In addition, there was a positive correlation between masticatory performance impairments and the orofacial dysfunction in UCLP group. In the multiple linear regression analysis also found a significant relationship between orofacial dysfunction and performance mastigatória. Conclusions: The presence of UCLP was associated with orofacial dysfunctions, resulting in the impairment of the social aspects of everyday life, besides causing damage to masticatory performance, perception of taste. Descriptive analysis showed {{that more than half of}} children with UCLP needed orthognathic surgery (GYI score = 5), while 66. 7 % of controls had slight treatment need (IOTN score = 2), and there was no association between malocclusion and <b>orofacial</b> <b>disorders.</b> In comparison analysis, UCLP group had higher NOT-S examination scores than controls, i. e., more frequent dysfunctions related to breathing, facial symmetry/expression and speech. Moreover, UCLP group reported more negative impacts on CPQ	social well-being domain than controls.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{taxonomy}} model based on ontological principles for disorders that manifest themselves through the symptom of persistent orofacial pain and are commonly seen in clinical practice {{and difficult to}} manage. Consensus meeting of eight experts from various geographic areas representing different perspectives (orofacial pain, headache, oral medicine and ontology) as an initial step towards improving the taxonomy. Ontological principles were introduced, reviewed and applied during the consensus building process. Diagnostic criteria for persistent dento-alveolar pain disorder (PDAP) were formulated as an example {{to be used to}} model the taxonomical structure of all orofacial pain conditions. These criteria have the advantage of being (i) anatomically defined, (ii) in accordance with other classification systems for the provision of clinical care, (iii) descriptive and succinct, (iv) easy to adapt for applications in varying settings, (v) scalable and (vi) transferable for the description of pain <b>disorders</b> in other <b>orofacial</b> regions of interest. Limitations are that the criteria introduce new terminology, do not have widespread acceptance and have yet to be tested. These results were presented to the greater conference membership and were unanimously accepted. Consensus for the diagnostic criteria of PDAP was established within this working group. This is an initial first step towards developing a coherent taxonomy for <b>orofacial</b> pain <b>disorders,</b> which is needed to improve clinical research and care...|$|R
50|$|There are {{two methods}} for {{treating}} tongue thrusting. The patient may place an appliance similar to a nightguard in the mouth at night, or may wear a more permanent device that can be removed and adjusted by a dentist. The other method requires oral habit training, an exercise technique called orofacial myofunctional therapy, that re-educates the muscles associated with swallowing by changing the swallowing pattern. Therapy treatment involves doing various tongue exercises to help strengthen the side tongue muscles. Certified Orofacial Myologists are trained professionals who receive specialty training in this field and are qualified to treat tongue thrust, <b>orofacial</b> myofunctional <b>disorders,</b> and oral habits. Myofunctional therapists work with patients to correct eating and drinking habits. Various exercises strengthen {{the sides of the}} tongue muscles to prohibit them from pushing on outer upper teeth. It is extremely important to correct the swallow of the tongue because the long term effects can wear down the enamel causing teeth to corrode. Over time the corroded teeth will cause discomfort in the jaw joints, which often leads to Temporomandibular Joint Disorder (TMJ). Therapy has proven to give the highest percentage of favorable results; however, the appliance is still used and is successful in some cases.. However, long term, orofacial myology still offers the highest long term rate of success.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Dental infections, {{frequent}} in {{the general}} population, are a common cause of inflammation with systemic impact, and {{are the most common}} cause of <b>orofacial</b> pain. Temporomandibular <b>disorders</b> are also frequent in the elderly and represent an important cause of secondary headache. Both inflammation and pain can also contribute to cognitive, functional and behavioral impairment of the elderly and aggravate symptoms of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We report a case of a 74 -year-old woman with AD and chronic facial pain who had a significant improvement in functional activities as well as in cognition and depressive symptoms after successful treatment of her facial pain. Patients with AD have higher compromise of oral health with infections and teeth loss. The investigation of orofacial pain should be performed in patients with AD, because of the associations reviewed and given the potential for improvement as highlighted by this case...|$|R
