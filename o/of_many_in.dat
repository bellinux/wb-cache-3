5|$|Amanita muscaria, {{commonly}} known as the fly agaric or fly amanita, is a basidiomycete mushroom, one <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> the genus Amanita. It is also a muscimol mushroom. Native throughout the temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, Amanita muscaria has been unintentionally introduced to many countries in the Southern Hemisphere, generally as a symbiont with pine and birch plantations, and is now a true cosmopolitan species. It associates with various deciduous and coniferous trees.|$|E

5|$|Later {{many other}} Sicilian {{towns and cities}} which had been either little damaged or {{completely}} untouched by the quake, such as Palermo, were also transformed by the Baroque style, as the fashion spread and aristocrats with a palazzo in Catania came to wish their palazzo in the capital to be as opulent as that in the second city. In Palermo the , began in 1566, was one <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> the city to be redecorated inside in the 18th century in the Baroque style, with coloured marbles.|$|E

5|$|Another {{controversial}} issue during Desha's tenure was his disdain for Horace Holley, president of Transylvania University. From the time Holley assumed {{the post of}} president in 1818, the university had risen to national prominence and attracted well-qualified and well-respected faculty members such as Constantine Samuel Rafinesque, Daniel Drake, Charles Caldwell, William T. Barry, and Jesse Bledsoe. However, Holley's New England Unitarian beliefs were too liberal for the tastes <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> Kentucky. Many called Holley an infidel and charged {{that he was a}} drinker and a gambler. He was criticized for spending time at the horse races and for furnishing his home with nude classical statues.|$|E
5|$|Lōʻihi Seamount's first {{depiction}} {{on a map}} was on Survey Chart 4115, a bathymetric {{rendering of}} part of Hawaiʻi compiled by the US Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1940. At the time, the seamount was non-notable, being one <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> the region. A large earthquake swarm first brought attention to it in 1952. That same year, geologist Gordon A. MacDonald hypothesized that the seamount was actually an active submarine shield volcano, similar to the two active Hawaiian volcanoes, Mauna Loa and Kīlauea. Macdonald's hypothesis placed the seamount as the newest volcano in the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain, created by the Hawaiʻi hotspot. However, because the earthquakes were oriented east–west (the direction of the volcanic fault) {{and there was no}} volcanic tremor in seismometers distant from the seamount, Macdonald attributed the earthquake to faulting rather than a volcanic eruption.|$|E
5|$|Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen {{takes place}} {{mostly in the}} fictional region of Kanto. This is one {{distinct}} region <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> the Pokémon world, which includes varied geographical habitats for the Pokémon species, human-populated towns and cities, and routes between locations. Some areas are only accessible once the player acquires a special item {{or one of the}} player's Pokémon learns a special ability. Near the end of the plot, the protagonist is able to venture to the Sevii Islands, a new area not present in the original Red and Blue games. The Sevii Islands are an archipelago of seven islands and contain Pokémon normally exclusive to the Johto region, as well as several post-game missions. After the aforementioned missions on the Sevii Islands are completed, the ability to trade with Ruby and Sapphire for Hoenn-exclusive Pokémon becomes available.|$|E

5|$|The {{active role}} of Treviño Morales got him the loyalty and respect <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> Los Zetas, and {{eventually}} many stopped paying to Lazcano Lazcano. In {{order to avoid}} his arrest or death from betrayal, Lazcano Lazcano reportedly fled the country and lived in Germany and Costa Rica for an unknown time with surrounding rumors that he had terminal cancer. Back in Mexico, Treviño Morales had become the stronger of the two in Los Zetas.
