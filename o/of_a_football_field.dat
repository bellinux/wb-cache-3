25|$|Wetlands {{in general}} are a {{valuable}} resource both economically and environmentally. For instance, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service determined wetlands covered only 5% of the land surface of the contiguous 48 United States, but they support 31% of the nation's plant species. These very biodiverse systems provide resources, shelter, nesting sites, and resting sites (particularly Louisiana’s coastal wetlands such as Grand Isle for migratory birds) to {{a wide array of}} wildlife. Human users also receive many benefits from wetlands, such as cleaner water, storm surge protection, oil and gas resources (especially on the Gulf Coast), reduced flooding, and chemical and biological waste reduction, to name a few. In Louisiana, rapid wetland loss occurs due to a variety of reasons; this state loses an estimated area about the size <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>football</b> <b>field</b> every hour.|$|E
25|$|That 1975 map, {{the first}} Cahill-Keyes projection, {{launched}} a decades long quest to perfect it. One of his goals is a map with a 1:1 million scale, {{about half the}} size <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>football</b> <b>field.</b> Each one degree geocell would {{be large enough to}} stand in. While the physical Master Map as he calls it, remains a dream, in 2010, his partner Mary Jo Graça, using Keyes's extensive calculations, plotted the entire projection and in 2011 digitized the entire map. Absent the physical version, a 9,000 square foot pdf of that full size map can be easily navigated on a home computer. It is the first contiguous world map at a resolution showing all one-degree geocells (except five degrees at the poles). Keyes likewise commissioned the first-ever one-degree globe from Joe Roubal in 2013.|$|E
25|$|Over the years, some of {{the most}} {{prominent}} projects at the University have been associated with the Department of Physics. In 1948, the university built the first betatron facility in Canada. Three years later, the world's first non-commercial cobalt-60 therapy unit was constructed. (The first female Chancellor of the University, Sylvia Fedoruk, {{was a member of the}} cobalt-60 research team. She also served as Saskatchewan's Lieutenant-Governor from 1988–1994.) The success of these facilities led to the construction of a linear accelerator as part of the Saskatchewan Accelerator Laboratory in 1964 and placed university scientists at the forefront of nuclear physics in Canada. Experience gained from years of research and collaboration with global researchers led to the University of Saskatchewan being selected as the site of Canada's national facility for synchrotron light research, the Canadian Light Source. This facility opened October 22, 2004 and is the size <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>football</b> <b>field.</b> The Plasma Physics Laboratory operates a tokamak on campus. The University used the SCR-270 radar in 1949 to image the Aurora for the first time.|$|E

500|$|Osborn {{appointed}} Beebe to {{the position}} of assistant curator of ornithology. As assistant curator, one of his principal jobs was to breed and rear the zoo's birds in order to sustain their population. Beebe placed much importance on the birds being given as much space as possible, and proposed the building of a [...] "flying cage" [...] the size <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>football</b> <b>field.</b> This was eventually built, although at less than half the size that Beebe had originally requested. While Beebe's flying cage was criticized as being based on an inaccurate understanding of birds' needs, it ultimately proved very successful.|$|E
500|$|The {{plans were}} met with {{criticism}} from locals on the Bergen side where the tunnel would emerge. They stated that the plans had [...] "cheap solutions" [...] and had unnecessary negative impact on their local environment. This included the demolishing <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>football</b> <b>field</b> and lack of noise barriers. Bergen Municipality demanded {{that the costs of}} a new field be paid for by the project, and that the tunnel be slightly extended. A new estimate was made, which increased the price by NOK10.3 million; however, Hordaland Public Roads Administration protested, stating that it would give an inferior road technically, that the existing development plans permitted the construction, and that the noise would not exceed the permitted limits. They concluded that should these demands remain, the increased costs would terminate the project. On 16 November 1992, Bergen City Council voted to allow the tunnel, under the condition that the tunnel project financed a new football field. The decision was appealed by lawyers representing the local community, but this was rejected by Hordaland County Governor on 30 August 1993.|$|E

Books located in one branch and requested from another go through the sorter, which use has cut the previous waiting time by at least a day. Together with 14 library employees, the machine can sort 7,500 items an hour (or 125 a minute). On the first floor of the Library Services Center is an ordering and cataloging office; on the second, the digital imaging department (formerly at the Main Branch building) and the manuscripts and archives division, where the air is kept cooler; on the third, the Barbara Goldsmith Preservation Division, with a staff of 10 (as of 2010) but designed for as many as 30 employees.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to his ability as a player, Lazetich developed a reputation as [...] "a wild character {{if there ever was}} one." [...] Decades later, Los Angeles Times columnist Frank Finch wrote that, although modern players were bigger and faster, he preferred the characters of the early NFL over the [...] "faceless robots" [...] of the modern game. [...] He focused in particular on Lazetich: [...] "A character's character was Ram middle guard Milan (Sheriff) Lazetich. [...] He was a blithe spirit from Montana who'd played college football at Michigan before joining the Rams in '46 for a five-year stint. [...] That he lasted that long with the club is remarkable in light of what he pulled at Dan Reeves' Christmas party for the team {{at the end of the}} '46 season." [...] Reeves, the Rams' owner, invited the team to a party at his home; the centerpiece was a large cake in the design <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>football</b> <b>field</b> topped with a full-size football covered in chocolate. [...] Teammate and Pro Football Hall of Famer Tom Fears later recalled the incident this way:"During the course of predinner libations, someone asked Lazetich to demonstrate his punting prowess. [...] I don't think he'd ever kicked a football before in his life. [...] They dared him to boot the chocolate football, which was a big mistake because Laz wasn't the kind of guy to take a dare lightly. [...] He ambled out to the kitchen, plucked the football off the top of the fancy cake, brought it out in the front room and drove his toe into it with beautiful form and a perfect follow through. [...] Cake, frosting and everything else that was loose was well distributed over the ceiling, walls, windows and drapes. ... It also was the last party Reeves ever held in his house for the Rams." ...|$|E
2500|$|The sudden {{closure of}} the border caused acute {{disruption}} for communities on both sides. Because the border had previously been merely an administrative boundary, homes, businesses, industrial sites and municipal amenities had been constructed straddling it, and some were now literally split down the middle. In Oebisfelde, residents could no longer access the shallow end of their swimming pool; in Buddenstedt, the border ran just behind the goal posts <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>football</b> <b>field,</b> putting the goalkeeper {{at risk of being}} shot by the border guards. An open-cast coal mine at Schöningen was split in half, causing Western and Eastern engineers to race to cart away equipment before the other side could seize it. Workers on both sides found themselves cut off from their homes and jobs. Farmers with land {{on the other side of}} the border effectively lost it, as they could no longer reach it. In Philippsthal, a house containing a printing shop was split in two by the border, which ran through the middle of the building. The doors leading to the East German portion of the building were bricked up and blocked until 1976. The disruption on the eastern side of the border was far worse. Some 8,369 civilians living in the Sperrgebiet were forcibly resettled in the GDR interior in a programme codenamed [...] "Operation Vermin" [...] (...) [...] Those expelled from the border region included foreigners and those who had a criminal record, had failed to register with the police or [...] "who because of their position in or toward society pose a threat". Another 3,000residents, realising that they were about to be expelled from their homes, fled to the West. By the end of 1952, the inner German border was virtually sealed.|$|E
