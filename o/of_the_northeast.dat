5|$|The area of {{disturbed}} {{weather that}} would soon become Chantal began in a large envelope of low pressure {{on the morning of}} September 10. The disturbed weather, nested off the coast of Bermuda, was one of the remnants of an old frontal trough that had extended from Hispaniola to the central north Atlantic Ocean. This particular area of disturbed weather become part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>northeast</b> portion of a low-pressure system. On September 10, a reconnaissance aircraft found sustained winds of 30mph (50km/h) and a 1010millibar (29.83inHg) pressure reading. This reading indicated the system developed into the fifth tropical depression of the 1983 season.|$|E
5|$|The roadway opened between Plymouth Meeting and the Lehigh Valley {{interchange}} near Allentown on November 23, 1955. The highway {{was extended}} north to Emerald on December 28, 1955. The Northeast Extension was opened between Emerald and Wyoming Valley on April1, 1957. The entire length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Northeast</b> Extension was finished on November7, 1957 with {{the completion of}} the northernmost part between Wyoming Valley and Scranton. The part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Northeast</b> Extension between Scranton and the New York border would not be built as part of the Pennsylvania Turnpike system but rather the Interstate Highway System as I-81. At the northern terminus, the Northeast Extension narrowed to two lanes along the northbound off-ramp at Scranton to come to its northern terminus, with an abandoned short spur of the mainline heading north. A pair of trumpet interchanges were built to connect the Northeast Extension and I-81. In 1980, the roadway would be designated PA9.|$|E

5|$|Important {{features}} {{incorporated in}} the line include four loops (spirals) and four 'Z' reverses (zigzags).

In 1897, a major earthquake damaged the railway requiring rebuilding of the route, including extensive improvements to the track and stations. Further modernization occurred as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Northeast</b> Frontier Railway Zone. Most trains on the route are still powered by steam engines, although a modern diesel engine is used for the Darjeeling Mail train. The railway is notable for its signage located at key vantage points, marking locations with titles such as Agony Point and Sensation Corner. Spirals located on steep hills are a feature of the railway that provide scenic views of the valleys below.|$|E

5|$|The Delaware State Highway Department (DSHD) {{was created}} on April 2, 1917 to {{construct}} and maintain a system of state highways across Delaware. As a result, the state took over construction of the DuPont Highway. The DuPont Highway was completed in 1923 when the final section near Odessa was finished. The DuPont Highway was a boon to southern Delaware, which had formerly been economically isolated from the large cities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>northeast.</b> In conjunction {{with the rise of}} the automobile, the highway spurred the growth of the Delaware Beaches by greatly improving access to the coast for tourists from northern Delaware and adjacent portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Northeast</b> megalopolis. Southern Delaware also developed into a major truck farming region due to having much greater access to urban markets. No longer fully reliant on the railroads to transport their goods, farmers in Sussex and Kent counties could market their fruits, vegetables, and broiler chickens directly to consumers in the north. Also during this time, the State Aid Road Law ushered in a period of highway improvement in which the county would offer road bonds and the state would match. The DSHD would then improve the highway. Most of the highways improved by the DSHD were built as concrete roads, with sharp curves eliminated. The state also took over the last of the private turnpikes and converted them to free roads. In 1926, the state began eliminating several railroad grade crossings and in 1927 the first all-weather secondary roads were constructed, consisting of one concrete lane and one dirt lane in an effort to reduce costs.|$|E
5|$|The Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike {{uses the}} ticket system method of tolling between the Mid-County and Wyoming Valley toll plazas {{along with the}} {{mainline}} Pennsylvania Turnpike. With the ticket system, a motorist receives a ticket upon entering the turnpike at an interchange and pays the fare and surrenders the ticket upon exiting. If a motorist loses the ticket, the turnpike charges the highest fare to the exit where the motorist leaves. Mainline toll plazas are also located at Keyser Avenue and Clarks Summit, charging a flat rate. There are no tolls on exit ramps between Wyoming Valley and Clarks Summit. E-ZPass is accepted at all toll plazas. As of 2017, it costs a passenger vehicle $12.10 to travel the length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Northeast</b> Extension between Mid-County and Wyoming Valley using cash and $8.54 using E-ZPass. The Keyser Avenue and Clarks Summit toll plazas cost $1.45 using cash and $0.81 using E-ZPass for passenger vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill passed}} through the Senate {{practically}} without a problem, but objections of the proposal increased {{by the time it}} reached the House of Representatives. It was generally held by critics that Hamilton was serving the interests <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Northeast</b> by means of the bank, and those of the agrarian lifestyle would not benefit from it. Among those critics was James Jackson of Georgia, who also attempted to refute the report by quoting from The Federalist Papers. Madison and Jefferson also opposed the bank bill. The potential of the capital not being moved to the Potomac if the bank was to have a firm establishment in Philadelphia (the current capital of the United States) was a more significant reason, and actions that Pennsylvania members of Congress took to keep the capital there made both men anxious.|$|E

5|$|The {{historical}} {{range of}} the bobcat was from southern Canada, throughout the United States, and {{as far south as}} the Mexican state of Oaxaca, and it still persists across much of this area. In the 20th century, it was thought to have lost territory in the US Midwest and parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Northeast,</b> including southern Minnesota, eastern South Dakota, and much of Missouri, mostly due to habitat changes from modern agricultural practices. While thought to no longer exist in western New York and Pennsylvania, multiple confirmed sightings of bobcats (including dead specimens) have been recently reported in New York's Southern Tier and in central New York. In addition, bobcat sightings have been confirmed in northern Indiana, and one was recently killed near Albion, Michigan. In early March, 2010, a bobcat was sighted (and later captured by animal control authorities) in a parking garage in downtown Houston. By 2010, bobcats appear to have recolonized many states, occurring in every state except Delaware.|$|E
5|$|The tickets {{along the}} Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike were {{originally}} handed out by person. In 1987, machines started to replace humans in distributing tickets. In 1990, an {{electronic toll collection}} system was proposed for the Pennsylvania Turnpike, where a motorist would create an account and use an electronic device that would be read from an electronic tollbooth. The motorist would be billed later. The multi-state electronic tolling system, which was to be called E-ZPass, was planned to be implemented by 1998. The planned installation date was later pushed back to 2000. On December2, 2000, E-ZPass debuted along the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike between Mid-County and Lehigh Valley. On December15, 2001, E-ZPass was extended to include the entire length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Northeast</b> Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Commercial vehicles were allowed to start using E-ZPass on December14, 2002.|$|E
