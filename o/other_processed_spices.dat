40|$|A spice is a {{vegetable}} substance of indigenous or exotic origin which is {{or has a}} hot, pigment taste, used to enhance taste of foods or to add to them the stimulant ingredients contained in them. Knowledge of radioactivity levels in human diet is of particular concern for the estimation of possible radiological hazards to human health. In this study, the radioactivity concentrations of 226 Ra, 232 Th, 40 K and 137 Cs in some selected natural and <b>processed</b> <b>spices</b> of different brands in the Madina District of Accra Metropolis were determined and the ingested doses via food consumption were also assessed using gamma spectrometry. The average activity concentration of 226 Ra, 232 Th, 40 K and 137 Cs in the natural spices were 0. 81 ± 0. 2 BqKg- 1, 0. 98 ± 0. 4 BqKg- 1, 2. 19 ± 0. 9 BqKg- 1 and 0. 06 ± 0. 01 BqKg- 1 respectively. For the <b>processed</b> <b>spices,</b> the average activity concentration of 226 Ra, 232 Th, 40 K and 137 Cs were 0. 18 ± 0. 1 BqKg- 1, 0. 3 ± 0. 1 BqKg- 1, 1. 3 ± 0. 8 BqKg- 1 and 0. 02 ± 0. 01 BqKg- 1 respectively. The levels of 137 Cs observed in the samples are {{within the range of}} ‘background’ concentrations. The estimated total annual effective dose received from 226 Ra, 232 Th and 137 Cs, due to consumption of natural (fresh) and <b>processed</b> <b>spices</b> by the inhabitants of Madina in the Accra metropolis was 8. 47 μSvy- 1 and this is far below the average radiation dose of 0. 29 mSvy- 1 received per caput worldwide due to ingestion of natural radionuclides provided in UNSCEAR (2000) report.

40|$|The {{construction}} industry is under increasing pressure to increase productivity and deliver a service of consistent quality [Latham 1994]. The Egan Report of July 1998 [Egan 1998], emphasised {{the call for}} productivity improvements and urged the industry to focus in particular on construction <b>processes.</b> <b>SPICE</b> [Sarshar et al. 2000] directly addresses this issue by developing a framework that provides direction and guidance for construction organisations to improve their processes.

40|$|On-chip {{microwave}} pulse-power detectors {{are promising}} devices for many electrical systems of both military and commercial applications. Most research in microwave power detector design have {{been focused on}} thermal power detectors, such as thermistors or thermocouples, due to their wide dynamic range and high frequency operation. However, due to their slow thermal response time, {{it is impossible to}} detect microwave pulses with a few micro or sub-micro seconds of pulse width. Schottky diode power detectors are the best candidates for this purpose due to their fast pulse response time and small size. We have developed a means for fabricating Schottky diodes as part of any Complementary-Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) process by modifying the layout file. CMOS Schottky diodes were added at pre-selected locations through a CMOS process. We have also developed a process for adding or deleting Schottky diodes on a CMOS fabricated chip by using Focused Ion Beam (FIB). FIB milling and ion induced deposition were used for adding or deleting Schottky diodes at any desired location on a CMOS-fabricated chip as a post-CMOS <b>process.</b> <b>Spice</b> model...|$|R
40|$|Microelectrode arrays (MEA) {{are widely}} used to record {{extracellular}} action potential (AP) and local field potential (LFP) in electropsychological studies. Conventional MEA detectors have < 7 bit linearity and 48 ∼ 60 dB dynamic range (DR). However, new immunological applications such as mast cell recoding require high linearity and wide DR. In this paper, we introduce a new MEA detector architecture with a continuous-time (CT) front-end and a discrete-time (DT) back-end to achieve high linearity. We also use chopping and an anti-aliasing low pass filter to reduce the noise in the CT front-end and the DT back-end respectively so as to achieve a wide DR. The detector is implemented in a 0. 35 μm CMOS <b>process.</b> <b>SPICE</b> simulation shows that the new detector achieves 0. 06 % linearity for 20 mV pp input signal and 0. 98 μV rms input-referred noise over 0. 8 - 400 Hz for LFPs, which results in 77 dB DR. The new detector can also record APs with 63 dB DR. The power consumption is 74 μW from a 3. 3 V supply. © 2011 IEEE...|$|R
