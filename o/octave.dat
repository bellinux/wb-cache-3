5|$|At a {{masquerade}} ball, various romantic liaisons are made. André and Christine declare {{their love}} for each other and plan to run away together. Robert and André come to an argument over Christine.

Schumacher and Marceau, who have both been expelled from the estate after a fight over Lisette, watch <b>Octave</b> and Christine in the greenhouse. They mistake Christine for Lisette because Christine is wearing Lisette's cape and hood. <b>Octave</b> returns to the house for his coat and hat, and is begged by Lisette not to leave with Christine.|$|E
5000|$|To {{reduce the}} {{repetition}} of the same liturgy for several days, Pope Leo XIII and Pope Pius X made further distinctions, classifying <b>octaves</b> into three primary types: privileged <b>octaves,</b> common <b>octaves,</b> and simple <b>octaves.</b> Privileged <b>octaves</b> were further arranged in a hierarchy of first, second, and third orders. For {{the first half of}} the 20th century, <b>octaves</b> were ranked in the following manner, which affected holding other celebrations within their timeframes: ...|$|R

5|$|Renoir {{edited the}} film while shooting; his first cut was three hours long. He and editor Marguerite {{completed}} a 113-minute final {{cut of the}} film in July 1939.

5|$|Sometimes, {{a single}} rank of pipes {{may be able}} to be {{controlled}} by several stops, allowing the rank to be played at multiple pitches or on multiple manuals. Such a rank is said to be unified or borrowed. For example, an 8 Diapason rank may also be made available as a 4 <b>Octave.</b> When both of these stops are selected and a key (for example, c) is pressed, two pipes of the same rank will sound: the pipe normally corresponding to the key played (c), and the pipe one <b>octave</b> above that (c). Because the 8 rank does not have enough pipes to sound the top <b>octave</b> of the keyboard at 4 pitch, it is common for an extra <b>octave</b> of pipes used only for the borrowed 4 stop to be added. In this case, the full rank of pipes (now an extended rank) is one <b>octave</b> longer than the keyboard.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm <b>Octave</b> was {{considered}} the worst tropical cyclone {{in the history of}} Arizona. The origins of Tropical Storm <b>Octave</b> were from a tropical disturbance that formed south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec on September23, 1983. Steered by a deep layer high over Mexico, the disturbance moved west for four days before becoming a tropical depression on September27 off the southwest coast of Mexico. Over an area of warm sea surface temperatures, it was able to quickly strengthen to peak winds of 50mph (85km/h), through wind shear prevented much further development. By September30, <b>Octave</b> was accelerating to the northeast, steadily weakening due to cooler waters. That day it weakened to tropical depression status, and on October2, <b>Octave</b> dissipated.|$|E

50|$|The RTTTL format allows <b>octaves</b> {{starting}} from the A below middle C and going up four <b>octaves.</b> This corresponds with the inability of cellphones to reproduce certain tones audibly. These <b>octaves</b> are numbered from lowest pitch to highest pitch from 4 to 7.|$|R
5000|$|After 1568, when Pope Pius V {{reduced the}} number of <b>octaves,</b> they were still numerous. Not only on the eighth day from the feast but on all the {{intervening}} days, the liturgy was the same as on the feast itself, with exactly the same prayers and Scripture readings. <b>Octaves</b> were classified into several types. Easter and Pentecost had [...] "specially privileged" [...] <b>octaves,</b> during which no other feast whatsoever could be celebrated. Christmas, Epiphany, and Corpus Christi had [...] "privileged" [...] <b>octaves,</b> during which certain highly ranked feasts might be celebrated. The <b>octaves</b> of other feasts allowed even more feasts to be celebrated.|$|R
5|$|Upon being named, <b>Octave</b> had {{developed}} a good outflow and shear was decreasing, leading to forecasters at the National Hurricane Center anticipating the storm to become a hurricane. The storm slowly strengthened over the following two days, becoming a strong tropical storm early on September 11. <b>Octave</b> later reached hurricane intensity late on September 11. as it developed an eye. Meanwhile, <b>Octave</b> was being steered by an anticyclone over Mexico and a trough to the west allowed the hurricane to continue northwest. Continuing to intensify, it was soon upgraded to Category2 status on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. During the afternoon of September 13, <b>Octave</b> intensified into a major hurricane, a storm with sustained winds of at least 111mph (178km/h). Early the next day, the hurricane attained peak intensity as Category4 hurricane, based on the Dvorak technique, a tool used to estimate tropical cyclone intensity. At this time, maximum winds were estimated at 135mph (215km/h) along with a barometric pressure of 94.8kPa (27.99inHg).|$|E
