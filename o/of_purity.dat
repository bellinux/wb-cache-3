5|$|Refined {{sugar is}} widely used for {{industrial}} needs for higher quality. Refined sugar is purer (ICUMSA below 300) than raw sugar (ICUMSA over 1,500). The level <b>of</b> <b>purity</b> associated with the colors of sugar, expressed by standard number ICUMSA, the smaller ICUMSA numbers indicate the higher purity of sugar.|$|E

5|$|Merit is {{connected}} with the notions <b>of</b> <b>purity</b> and goodness. Before Buddhism, merit was used with regard to ancestor worship, but in Buddhism it gained a more general ethical meaning. Merit is a force that results from good deeds done; {{it is capable of}} attracting good circumstances in a person's life, as well as improving the person's mind and inner well-being. Moreover, it affects the next lives to come, as well as the destination a person is reborn. The opposite of merit is demerit (papa), and it is believed that merit is able to weaken demerit. Indeed, merit has even been connected to the path to Nirvana itself, but many scholars say that this refers only to some types of merit.|$|E
25|$|The {{military}} police emblem, designed in 1949, {{consists of a}} shield and five flame tongues which, according to the creators, represent the five unbreakable truths of the {{military police}}: <b>Purity</b> <b>of</b> the arm, <b>purity</b> <b>of</b> arms, <b>purity</b> <b>of</b> heart, <b>purity</b> <b>of</b> action and <b>purity</b> <b>of</b> the eye. By contrast, the military police pin, or hamatzon, has only four flame tongues. A sixth flame tongue is sometimes added to specific unit insignia, symbolizing the <b>purity</b> <b>of</b> scale.|$|R

5|$|The natural {{untreated}} water is generally devoid of all minerals, bacteria, and suspended matter, approaching {{the purity of}} distilled water. In 1987 Malvern gained official EU status as a natural mineral water, a mark <b>of</b> <b>purity</b> and quality. However, in spite of regular quality analysis, drought in 2006 dried out the rock that filters the water, allowing the water to flow through it too quickly for the natural filtering process. Due to the slight impurities, the Coca-Cola Company, manufacturer of the Schweppes brand, had to install filtration equipment, which reclassifies the water as spring water under EU law.|$|E
5|$|At {{a meeting}} of the S-1 Executive Committee on 14 November 1942, Chadwick had {{expressed}} a fear that the alpha particles emitted by plutonium could produce neutrons in light elements present as impurities, which in turn would produce fission in the plutonium and cause a predetonation, a chain reaction before the core was fully assembled. This had been considered by Oppenheimer and Seaborg the month before, and the latter had calculated that neutron emitters like boron had to be restricted to one part in a hundred billion. There was some doubt about whether a chemical process could be developed that could ensure this level <b>of</b> <b>purity,</b> and Chadwick brought the matter to the S-1 Executive Committee's attention for it to be considered further. Four days later, though, Lawrence, Oppenheimer, Compton and McMillan reported to Conant that they had confidence that the exacting purity requirement could be met.|$|E
5|$|The CM Division was {{responsible}} for the purification and fabrication of materials for the bomb, including the core, tamper and initiator. The chemistry and metallurgy of uranium was fairly well known, although it did yield a few surprises, but that of plutonium was almost completely unknown. The element had only been discovered a short time before, and existed only in microgram amounts. Educated guesses about its chemistry tended to be wrong, and as research progressed it was found to have unusual properties, including no less than six allotropes. There was rivalry between its discoverers, with Wahl and Kennedy's group at Los Alamos competing with Seaborg's in Chicago to produce the best process for purifying the metal. This competition ended abruptly when Segrè's group at Los Alamos discovered that high levels of a hitherto undiscovered plutonium-240 isotope in reactor-produced plutonium meant that an implosion-type nuclear weapon was required, and a high degree <b>of</b> <b>purity</b> was therefore unnecessary.|$|E

40|$|Indian {{civilisation}} {{has been}} strongly characterised {{by the work}} of containment erected by the Brahmanical elite over the almost two thousand years of its grandiose attempt at culturally and so- cially dominating the Indian world as a whole. Lacking any direct power, the Brahmans have re- placed it by successfully imposing, as an alternative, an opposition between purity and impurity that has marked every aspect <b>of</b> Indian culture: <b>purity</b> <b>of</b> spirit, <b>purity</b> <b>of</b> philosophy, <b>purity</b> <b>of</b> rites, <b>purity</b> <b>of</b> language, <b>purity</b> <b>of</b> social and religious conduct, etc. Nondualistic Śaiva Tantrism’s re- sponse starts by questioning the legitimacy and very basis of the division between pure and impure, destined to crumble progressively beneath the thrust of deliberate “non-dual” behaviour (advaitācāra). Purity or impurity are not properties of things. They are quali cations pertaining to the knower depending on whether he perceives the object as united with consciousness or not. “Impure is what has fallen away from consciousness: therefore everything is pure if it has achieved identity with consciousness. ” Moreover, if Śiva “is” the universe, there may be no impu- rity. In the Tantric texts special emphasis is laid on the necessity to overcome śaṅkā (“hesitation, inhibition”), viewed as the ultimate purpose of the Brahmanical rules concerning purity/impurity, acting as a subtle and effective instrumentum regni...|$|R
5|$|The eze Nri was {{the title}} of the ruler of Nri with ritual and mystic (but not military) power. He was a ritual figure rather than a king in the {{traditional}} sense. The eze Nri was chosen after an interregnum period while the electors waited for supernatural powers to manifest in the new eze Nri. He was installed after a symbolic journey to Aguleri on the Anambra River. The authorities must be notified prior to commencement of this journey to obtain the Ududu-eze,the royal scepter.

The eze Nri was in all aspects a divine ruler.|$|E

Due to the slight impurities, the Coca-Cola Company, manufacturer of the Schweppes brand, had to install filtration equipment, which reclassifies the water as spring water under European Union law. Consequently, the labels were change from: Malvern The Original English Natural Mineral Water.
