25|$|Finally, on 1 December, {{the crisis}} ended when Bjelke-Petersen {{announced}} his retirement from politics. He declared: The policies of the National Party are no longer those <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> went to the people. Therefore I have no wish to lead the Government any longer. It was my intention to take this matter {{to the floor of}} State Parliament. However, I now have no further interest in leading the National Party any further.Three months later, Bjelke-Petersen called on voters at the federal by-election in Groom to support the Liberal candidate instead of the National contestant. Bjelke-Petersen said the Nationals had lost their way and turned their backs on traditional conservative policies.|$|E

500|$|Barkas, {{a former}} film director, {{was set to}} work [...] "on the task of {{providing}} props for the biggest 'film production' <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> ever expect to be engaged". Work began on 27 September, giving 4 weeks before {{the day of the}} attack.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{his success}} in {{advancing}} Nixon's career, Chotiner was respected, but was not universally popular among the Vice President's backers. Frank Jorgensen, one of Nixon's first backers in the Voorhis race, said of the attorney, [...] "I knew that Murray was very impatient with people who didn't have the IQ that he had. He had the habit of {{a man like that}} of tramping on them. He'd move ahead. He'd just leave the wreckage behind him, but he would get the job done." [...] Nixon family friend and Whittier College trustee Herman Perry stated, [...] "When Murray develops a little more of the techniques of public relations, I {{will be one of the}} first to recognize it and one of the first to give him credit... The one thing I do not want him to do is be the quarterback and call the plays on the team <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> play." ...|$|E
500|$|Austen {{wrote in}} her first {{surviving}} letter to her sister Cassandra that Lefroy was [...] "very gentlemanlike, good-looking, pleasant young man". She called him her [...] "friend" [...] and explained that on this account Cassandra must be anxious {{to know more about}} her new [...] "friend". Five days later in another letter, Austen wrote she expected an [...] "offer" [...] from her [...] "friend" [...] and that [...] "I shall refuse him, however, unless he promises to give away his white coat", going on to write [...] "I will confide myself in the future to Mr Tom Lefroy, for whom I don't give a sixpence" [...] and refuse all others. The next day, Austen wrote: [...] "The day will come <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> flirt my last with Tom Lefroy and when you receive this it will be all over. My tears flow as I write at this melancholy idea".|$|E

500|$|The same spring, on 12 May 1787, {{the still}} {{hesitant}} Wilberforce held {{a conversation with}} William Pitt and the future Prime Minister William Grenville as they sat under a large oak tree on Pitt's estate in Kent. Under {{what came to be}} known as the [...] "Wilberforce Oak" [...] at Holwood, Pitt challenged his friend: [...] "Wilberforce, why don't you give notice of a motion on the subject of the Slave Trade? You have already taken great pains to collect evidence, and are therefore fully entitled to the credit which doing so will ensure you. Do not lose time, or the ground will be occupied by another." [...] Wilberforce's response is not recorded, but he later declared in old age that he could [...] "distinctly remember the very knoll <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> was sitting near Pitt and Grenville" [...] where he made his decision.|$|E
500|$|In February 2005, Griffin {{was asked}} {{to take part in}} a debate on {{multiculturalism}} at the University of St Andrews in Scotland. He was invited by the president of the students' debating society, who said [...] "We believe that the only way to get the truth of what the BNP are saying and to combat them is to do it in public in a debate." [...] The move was attacked by anti-racist groups, some of whom refused to participate in the discussion. [...] Griffin said [...] "I am coming up because I was invited by the students at the university because they have a debate on an intelligent subject <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> have something to say. The people against it are the usual bunch of people who cannot win the argument and refuse to stand on a platform." [...] The society withdrew the invitation before the event was to take place.|$|E
500|$|... t all {{looks like}} reporting, but {{everything}} underscores (indique à l'évidence) {{that it is}} the fiction of a documentary (in fact, Kiarostami shot the film several months after the 1990 earthquake), and that it is rather a document about [...] "fiction": not in the sense of imagining the unreal, but in the very specific and precise sense of the technique, of the art of constructing images. For the image by means of which, each time, each opens a world and precedes himself in it (s'y prédède) is not pregiven (donnée toute faite) (as are those of dreams, phantasms or bad films): it is to be invented, cut and edited. Thus it is evidence, insofar as, if one day I happen to look at my street <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> walk up and down ten times a day, I construct for an instant a new evidence of my street.> ...|$|E

500|$|Geneva reconsidered its {{expulsion}} of Calvin. Church attendance had dwindled {{and the political}} climate had changed; as Bern and Geneva quarrelled over land, their alliance frayed. When Cardinal Jacopo Sadoleto {{wrote a letter to}} the city council inviting Geneva to return to the Catholic faith, the council searched for an ecclesiastical authority to respond to him. At first Pierre Viret was consulted, but when he refused, the council asked Calvin. He agreed and his Responsio ad Sadoletum (Letter to Sadoleto) strongly defended Geneva's position concerning reforms in the church. On 21 September 1540 the council commissioned one of its members, Ami Perrin, to find a way to recall Calvin. An embassy reached Calvin while he was at a colloquy, a conference to settle religious disputes, in Worms. His reaction to the suggestion was one of horror in which he wrote, [...] "Rather would I submit to death a hundred times than to that cross <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> had to perish daily a thousand times over." ...|$|E
500|$|Taft {{was sworn}} in as {{president}} on March 4, 1909. Due to a winter storm that coated Washington with ice, Taft was inaugurated within the Senate Chamber rather than outside the Capitol as is customary. The new president stated in his inaugural address that he had been honored to have been [...] "one of the advisers of my distinguished predecessor" [...] and to have had a part [...] "in the reforms he has initiated. I should be untrue to myself, to my promises, and to the declarations of the party platform <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> was elected if I did not make the maintenance and enforcement of those reforms a most important feature of my administration". He pledged to make those reforms long-lasting, ensuring that honest businessmen did not suffer uncertainty through change of policy. He spoke of the need for reduction of the 1897 Dingley Tariff, for antitrust reform, and for continued advancement of the Philippines toward full self-government. Roosevelt left office with regret that his tenure in the position he enjoyed so much was over and, to keep out of Taft's way, arranged for a year-long hunting trip to Africa.|$|E

6000|$|... "I really {{regret that}} you should have thought it {{necessary}} to apologize for troubling me. Your past kindness to the unhappy Mrs. Evelin gives you a friendly claim <b>on</b> me <b>which</b> <b>I</b> gladly recognize--as you shall soon see.|$|R

[...] He also enjoyed a revival in the much-acclaimed TV adaptation of The Forsyte Saga (1967) and the Father Brown series (1974).|$|E

The only reason I knew a [...] "Mrs. Wilson", not [...] "Mrs. Plame", worked at the agency was because I saw it in a memo. But I don't disagree with her words to a large measure.|$|E
2500|$|According to a 2006 Newsweek interview, [...] "For Graham, {{politics}} is a secondary to the Gospel.... When Newsweek asked Graham whether ministers—whether they {{think of themselves as}} evangelists, pastors or a bit of both—should spend time engaged with politics, he replied: 'You know, I think in a way that has to be up to the individual as he feels led of the Lord. A lot of things that I commented on years ago would not have been of the Lord, I'm sure, but I think you have some—like communism, or segregation, <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> think you have a responsibility to speak out.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{he worked}} on the mural, Picasso said: [...] "The Spanish {{struggle}} is the fight of reaction against the people, against freedom. My whole life as an artist has been nothing more than a continuous struggle against reaction and the death of art. How could anybody think for a moment that I could be in agreement with reaction and death? ... In the panel <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> am working, which I shall call Guernica, and in all my recent works of art, I clearly express my abhorrence of the military caste which has sunk Spain in an ocean of pain and death." ...|$|E
