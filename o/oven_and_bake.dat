40|$|Author: Microscopy Laboratory (This {{procedure}} {{can also}} be used for virtually any material that must be pelleted prior to fixation and thin sectioning) ### Primary fix: - 2 % glutaraldehyde (from 25 % or 10 % stock) in microtubule assembly buffer. - For better contrast of the tubulin, you can add 0. 1 -. 5 % tannic acid. ### Secondary Fix: 0. 5 - 1 % OsO 4 in the same buffer. OsO 4 is kept in the refrigerator in a jar and is made as a 4 % solution in water. It is very volatile and must be used in the hood. Osmium crystals take about a day to dissolve, so be certain that there is sufficient stock before you start your experiment. 1. Pellet microtubules at 15 - 20, 000 rpm in eppendorf tubes. Try to obtain a small and tightly packed pellet. - Remove supernatant and overlay pellet with glutaraldehyde solution. Fix at room temperature for ~ 1 hour. If necessary, this can be left overnight at room temperature. - If the pellet is large, loosen it {{from the bottom of the}} tube by making a small wedge with a Q-tip stick and using the stick to slide the pellet off the bottom. Then cut the pellet into small pieces with a razor blade. - Rinse the pellet with 2 - 4 changes of fixation buffer without the glutaraldehyde. - Postfix with 0. 5 - 1 % OsO 4 in the microtubule assembly buffer or in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7. 0 for ~ 1 hr at room temp or on ice. - Rinse the pellet with several changes of water and soak in 1 % uranyl acetate for 30 min - overnight, room temperature. NOTE: the pH of uranyl acetate is ~ 4. 0 so your water rinse should remove any PIPES, that would precipitate at low pH, or phosphate buffer, which precipitates as uranyl phosphate crystals. - Transfer the pellet to a glass scintillation vial and rinse with water. Then dehydrate specimen by 10 - 15 min incubations in acetone:water mixtures of 25 %, 50 %, 75 %, and at least two 100 % acetone rinses. - Infiltrate the samples with plastic. Incubate 4 hrs-overnight in 1 / 3 resin and 2 / 3 acetone. Remove the resin and add 2 / 3 resin: 1 / 3 acetone and incubate for another 4 - 6 hours in the hood on the rotator. Finally, transfer to 100 % spurr plastic and incubate for 2 - 6 hours. - I like to use a reasonable volume of the 1 / 3 plastic: 2 / 3 acetone mixture, put it on the rotator in the hood with the cap off overnight, and allow the acetone to gradually evaporate in the hood. Be certain that there is enough plastic to cover the specimen and that the acetone does not evaporate and leave the specimen exposed to the air. Then simply remove remaining resin and add 100 % resin to the sample and keep on the rotator for another 4 - 6 hours. - Pour resin in the flat embedding molds, position your sample near the front (pointy) part of each mold, and insert a note at the back of the block to identify it. I usually use a small piece of 3 x 5 card with notes written in pencil. - Put in 80 degrees <b>oven</b> <b>and</b> <b>bake</b> overnight or for ~ 48 hrs. Remove and section...|$|E

40|$|The Solid Rocket Boosters (SRB's) used {{to launch}} the Space Shuttle are coated {{with a layer of}} {{ablative}} material to prevent thermal damage when they reenter the earth's atmosphere. The coating consists of a mixture of cork, glass, and resin. A new coating (Marshall Convergent Coating, MCC- 2) was recently developed that is environmentally complaint. The coating must meet certain minimum thickness standards {{in order to protect the}} SRB. The coating is applied by a robot controlled nozzle that moves from the bottom to top, as the rocket part rotates on a table. Several coats are applied, building up to the desired thickness. Inspectors do a limited amount of destructive 'wet' testing. This involves an inspector inserting a rod in the wet coating and removing the rod. This results in a hole that, of course, must be patched later. The material is cured and the thickness is measured. There is no real-time feedback as the coating is being applied. Although this might seem like the best way to control thickness, the problems with 'blowback' (reflected material covering the sensor) are formidable, and have not been solved. After the thermal coating is applied, a protective top coat is applied. The SRB part is then placed in a <b>oven</b> <b>and</b> <b>baked</b> to harden the surface. The operations personnel then measure the thickness of the layer using the Kaman 7200 Displacement Measuring System. The probe is placed on the surface. One person (the inspector) reads the instrument, while another(the technician) records the thickness. Measurements are taken at one foot intervals. After the measurements are taken, the number of low readings is tabulated. If more than 10 percent of the points fall below the minimum value, there is a design review, and the part may be stripped of coating, and a new coating is applied. There is no other analysis...|$|R
50|$|Consider an RPD cake-baking {{example from}} Montgomery (2005), where an {{experimenter}} wants {{to improve the}} quality of cake. While the cake manufacturer can control the amount of flour, amount of sugar, amount of baking powder, and coloring content of the cake, other factors are uncontrollable, such as <b>oven</b> temperature <b>and</b> <b>bake</b> time. The manufacturer can print instructions for a bake time of 20 minutes but in the real world has no control over consumer baking habits. Variations in the quality of the cake can arise from baking at 325° instead of 350° or from leaving the cake in the oven for a slightly too short or too long period of time. Robust parameter designs seek to minimize the effects of noise factors on quality. For this example, the manufacturer hopes to minimize the effects in fluctuation of bake time on cake quality, and in doing this the optimal settings for the control factors are required.|$|R

50|$|Mario's started {{operations}} in June 1972 at the Valpark Shopping Plaza and {{has grown to}} twenty one restaurants in Trinidad and Tobago, plus five stores in Guyana. The chain is {{owned and operated by}} Richard Harford, one of the founding partners. The pizza is unique in that it uses a cheddar cheese from New Zealand rather than the traditional mozzarella, this was decided upon because of the sharper more flavourful taste. Trinidadians, usually prefer more spicy, bold and hot flavours, this is why Mario's secret pizza sauce is made with 8 specially chosen herbs and spices. The choice of cheese, the spices in their sauce and the variety of toppings have made them a leading pizza restaurant in the regions in which they operate. The restaurants also sell other foods, such as hamburgers, fried chicken <b>and</b> <b>Oven</b> <b>Baked</b> Artisan Sandwiches.|$|R
5000|$|According to Polish food {{historian}} Maria Dembińska, [...] may {{derive from}} a medieval dish known in Latin as , or [...] "mixture". It {{was made from}} various vegetables, such as cabbage, chard and onions, that were chopped or shredded, layered inside an earthenware three-legged Dutch <b>oven</b> <b>and</b> braised or <b>baked.</b> A remnant of this old procedure {{may be found in}} a [...] recipe, in which bacon and cabbage are arranged in layers, from the 19th-century Russian cookbook, A Gift to Young Housewives by Elena Molokhovets. Similar, layered dishes of medieval origin exist in other European cuisines; they include the Italian [...] (known in 16th-century Poland under the Polonized name, [...] ) and the Alsatian [...] (also known as [...] ), made from cabbage, leftover meats and fruits. They are reminiscent of a rustic Polish casserole, known in various regions as , etc. It is traditionally made from sliced or diced potatoes, onions, carrots, sausages and bacon arranged in layers inside a cast-iron cauldron greased with lard and lined with cabbage leaves, which is placed in bonfire embers for baking.|$|R
5000|$|The dough for lángos is made {{of water}} or milk and flour, yeast, sugar and salt. Adding sour cream, yoghurt or mashed {{potatoes}} to the dough is optional, {{in the latter case}} it is called potato lángos (in Hungarian krumplis lángos). It is eaten fresh and warm, topped with sour cream and grated cheese, or Liptauer, ham, or sausages, or most frequently, without toppings, just rubbed with garlic or garlic butter, or doused with garlic water. Other ingredients and accompaniments can be mushroom, quark cheese, eggplant, cabbage, kefir, omelet, and a confectioner's sugar or jam. Traditionally lángos was baked {{in the front of the}} brick oven close to the flames. This is the basis for its name; [...] "láng" [...] means [...] "flame" [...] in the Hungarian language. Lángos was made from bread dough and was served as breakfast on the days when new bread was baked. Now that people no longer have brick <b>ovens</b> <b>and</b> do not <b>bake</b> bread at home, lángos is virtually always fried in oil.|$|R
