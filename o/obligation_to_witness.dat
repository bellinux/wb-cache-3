40|$|Bonniers Konsthall inaugurates September 19 th The Image of War, an {{exhibition}} {{that looks at}} the tripartite relationship between those who do the depicting, those who are being depicted and those who then see what’s been depicted. There’s a certain contestation between an <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> bear <b>witness</b> and complexities of representation {{when it comes to}} the violence of war. If for the sake of evidence and testimony it must be made an image, does it come to represent a call for representation? Is it ultimately the commitment of making the image that is foregrounded? And does the image then work out of what’s taken to be especially tragic; violence denied an image? If so, is the image of war a lesser of two evils and thus relatively good? Or does its visualization determine a tolerance toward production and viewership? To ask does not negate the necessity to create images of violence. To find ways of seeing violence is a crucial political project. What it suggests, rather, is that across an image complex that includes violence that is denied an image we must understand a double mode of transmission; on the one hand the demonstrative, that which is capable of being shown; and on the other hand the unspeakable, the inaccessible. Omitting the documentary while mirroring the inundating flow of imagery in old and new media outlets by presenting a great number of works the focus of this exhibition is artworks that grapple with questions of the image and reflect on the violence of war in tandem. In part to view how artists have worked with subjects like witnessing, monuments and evidence, but also because while journalists, fighters, activists, citizens, or satellite and surveillance cameras might depict it, what art can do is work through the image of war and call into question its representation, deepening our understanding of such imagery and its part in shaping a political stance to conflict. Especially today, as contemporary artists who not only portray but explore the image and its consequential politics have replaced the war-painters of old...|$|R

40|$|We {{naturally}} attribute <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> groups, {{and take}} such <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> have {{consequences for the}} obligations of group members. The threat posed by anthropogenic climate change provides an urgent case. It seems that we, together, have an <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> prevent climate catastrophe, and that we, as individuals, have an <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> contribute. However, understood strictly, attributions of <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> groups might seem illegitimate. On the one hand, the groups in question—the people alive today, say—are rarely fully-fledged moral agents, making it unclear {{how they can be}} subjects of obligations. On the other, the attributions can rarely be understood distributively, as concerned with members’ <b>obligations,</b> because <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> do something require a capacity to do it, and individual members often lack the relevant capacities. Moreover, even if groups can have obligations, it is unclear why that would be relevant for members, exactly because members often lack control over whether group obligations are fulfilled. In previous work, I have argued that a general understanding of individual <b>obligations</b> extends non-mysteriously <b>to</b> irreducibly shared <b>obligations,</b> rendering attributions of <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> groups legitimate. In this paper, I spell out how the proposed account also helps us understand the relation between individual and shared obligations. Even though few individual human agents have any significant control over whether we will be successful in preventing climate catastrophe, our collective capacity to prevent catastrophe and shared preventative <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> do so can give rise <b>to</b> significant individual <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> contribute to its fulfillment...|$|R
40|$|Most adult human {{activities}} reflect a moral position. This thesis aims {{to show that}} art, as one form of human endeavour, follows suit. Consequently, art education should reflect this connection. In this thesis I make a philosophical investigation of one possible approach to art education. Furthermore, to be reflective of western society's emphasis on personal autonomy and authenticity, I contend that the only appropriate moral stance in education should be intuitive, non-calculating and non-utilitarian. In order to philosophically illustrate and support my position, I use the aesthetic thoughts of Bergson and Nietzsche {{and put them in}} opposition. This is because they exemplify two opposite conceptions of morality that currently permeate society. Bergson's concept of aesthetics depends upon a stance of disinterest. Nietzsche's is utilitarian. The first exemplifies a humanist orientation that supports an altruistic morality and an aesthetics that puts emphasis on perception. This ethical position actually emerges from an active consciousness, a personal mode of being. On the other hand, Nietzsche's stance is a precursor to one strand of postmodern thought that may be described as a pragmatism oriented towards the achievement of power. This attitude excludes any possible form of disinterestedness. Indeed, Nietzscheism espouses a "noble egoism" and an impersonal mode of being that breeds a narcissistic and immature form of artistic creation. This is a creation that becomes a glorification and edification of oneself, albeit an impersonal self. This is a narcissistic attitude that finds an echo in some trends of contemporary art. In regard to contemporary art, I argue that Nietzsche's influence may be seen in a deviant utilitarian morality that results in a scientistic and anti-aesthetic artistic current. This is a nihilistic trend evident in the work of artists such as Marcel Duchamp. As an alternative, I propose a Bergsonian "ethico-aesthetic" conception of art, inspired and encompassed by disinterestedness as a mature pedagogical value. From this perspective, instead of a neutral attitude, we maintain a more empathic position toward life and art. This altruistic morality produces a responsible and sensible art [...] -concerned with the creation of common grounds. This suggests a need for a form of creation that unfolds from what Bergson could term a "mysterious" sentiment of <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> bear <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> beauty, in all its forms, as a precisely non-utilitarian and disinterested experience of perception...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} proposes {{an explanation}} of why {{the state has a}} special moral <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> protect individuals in its legal territory against violence committed by private actors. Having {{an explanation of}} this obligation will allow us to better determine a number of its major characteristics, including to whom the state owes this obligation [...] the scope of the obligation [...] apart from those persons actually located in the state's legal territory. It argues that the state has a special moral <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> protect because the state is the fiduciary of those individuals in its legal territory and has a fiduciary <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> advance their purposes reasonably. Since obtaining security from violence is a normal and fundamental purpose of individuals, the state has a fiduciary <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> protect them from private violence. To support this conclusion, the dissertation evaluates whether the most plausible explanations of the special <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> protect can account for our moral intuitions. Apart from the fiduciary explanation, it considers and rejects four alternatives. First, the <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> protect might arise as an application of an inherent duty to promote justice, including by protecting against acts of violence. Second, it might arise because the state normally contributes causally to the harm from most or all acts of violence that occur in its territory, so it has an <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> protect against that harm. Third, it might arise because the state implicitly promises to protect by communicating a claim that it has a monopoly on the legitimate use of force. Fourth, it might arise because the exercise of coercive political control is legitimate only if the state simultaneously protects against violence. After rejecting these alternatives, the dissertation explains, defends, and applies the fiduciary account {{to the question of the}} scope of the special <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> protect...|$|R
