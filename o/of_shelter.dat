5|$|A four-man {{survey party}} from No. 5 Mobile Works Squadron RAAF arrived on Goodenough Island on 3 January 1943. They {{selected}} Beli Beli Bay as a suitable site for an anchorage. Here, a 5,000ton (14,000 m3) ship could anchor {{half a mile}} (0.8km) offshore with some degree <b>of</b> <b>shelter</b> from the south-east and north-west. A member of the survey team and 100 local workers recruited by ANGAU began constructing a jetty at Beli Beli Bay and improving the foot track to Vivigani. An advance party of 54men from No. 5 Mobile Works Squadron arrived on 27 February 1943.|$|E
5|$|Bobcat {{activities}} {{are confined to}} well-defined territories, which vary in size depending on the sex {{and the distribution of}} prey. The home range is marked with feces, urine scent, and by clawing prominent trees in the area. In its territory, the bobcat has numerous places <b>of</b> <b>shelter,</b> usually a main den, and several auxiliary shelters on the outer extent of its range, such as hollow logs, brush piles, thickets, or under rock ledges. Its den smells strongly of the bobcat.|$|E
40|$|For {{some years}} now, the UK {{government}} have discouraged any further development <b>of</b> <b>sheltered</b> housing schemes. Older {{people are living}} longer and their expectation and lifestyle are changing. They are also seeking sheltered home appropriate to their circumstances. The growing importance of housing provision {{for the elderly and}} the increasing needs and expectations of the elderly for improved housing provisions are becoming ever more pressing. Increasingly, sheltered housing providers are faced with issues of difficult to let housing stock. Also, concerns have been raised within the housing industry on the falling demands for small bedsit units. These small size bedsits were a significant part <b>of</b> <b>sheltered</b> housing provision dating back to 1960 s and 1970 s. As a result of the changing expectations of accommodation standards, many housing providers are now identifying the need to review their sheltered housing stock to ensure sustainability. A review of the changing face <b>of</b> <b>sheltered</b> housing over the years is documented. The main contribution is an extensive review of literature on the concept <b>of</b> <b>sheltered</b> housing; the development <b>of</b> <b>sheltered</b> housing and the evolution <b>of</b> <b>sheltered</b> housing over the years. A survey <b>of</b> <b>sheltered</b> housing provision is presented to illustrate changes that have taken place since the inception <b>of</b> <b>sheltered</b> housing 50 years ago. These findings have important implications for sheltered housing providers to provide functionally appropriate dwellings to meet the increasing demand, particularly of the elderly wishing to move into sheltered housin...|$|R

5|$|During the winter, the Mayflower colonists {{suffered}} {{greatly from}} lack <b>of</b> <b>shelter,</b> {{diseases such as}} scurvy, and general conditions onboard ship. Many of the able-bodied men were too infirm to work; 45 out of 102 pilgrims died and were buried on Cole's Hill. Thus, only seven residences (of a planned nineteen) and four common houses were constructed during the first winter. By the end of January, enough of the settlement had been built to begin unloading provisions from the Mayflower. In mid-February, after several tense encounters with local Native Americans, the male residents of the settlement organized themselves into military orders; Myles Standish was designated as the commanding officer. By {{the end of the}} month, five cannons had been defensively positioned on Fort Hill. John Carver was elected governor to replace Governor Martin.|$|E
5|$|Malvern {{lies in the}} Lower Severn/Avon plain affording it {{a degree}} <b>of</b> <b>shelter</b> caused {{by virtue of its}} {{nestling}} in between the Cotswold hills to the east, the Welsh Hills and Mountains to the west, and Birmingham plateau to the north. Although as with all the British Isles it has a maritime climate, the local topography means summer warmth can become emphasised by a slight foehn effect off the surrounding hills. The record maximum stands at 35.8c(96.4f) set in August 1990. Typically 17.3 days of the year will reach 25.1c(77.2f) or higher and the annual warmest day should reach 29.8c(85.6f) according to the 1971–00 observing period.|$|E
5|$|Outer rainbands began {{affecting}} coastal {{sections of}} the Florida Panhandle by about 12hours prior {{to the formation of}} the depression. Coinciding with the first advisory on the depression, the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning from Apalachicola, Florida, westward to the mouth of the Mississippi River. Shortly thereafter, an inland tropical storm warning was issued for Pearl River, Walthall, and Pike counties in Mississippi and Washington Parish in Louisiana. Additionally, the New Orleans National Weather Service issued a coastal flood watch for four parishes in southeastern Louisiana. In Mississippi, Governor Haley Barbour {{declared a state of emergency}}. Officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for residents in shallow areas and in mobile homes for Jackson, Harrison, and Hancock counties. Officials in New Orleans opened three emergency shelters, citing the potential need <b>of</b> <b>shelter</b> for citizens in about 17,000FEMA trailers after Hurricane Katrina. Due to the threat of the cyclone, Louisiana governor Kathleen Blanco declared a state of emergency and placed the state's National Guard and other disaster services on reserve.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{looks at}} the provision <b>of</b> <b>sheltered</b> housing for the elderly by local authorities in County Durham in 1976. Durham has high provision of such housing, around 14 % of the population aged sixty-five and over live in such dwellings. The aims <b>of</b> <b>sheltered</b> housing are given, followed by {{a description of the}} accommodation, wardens, alarm systems and, to a limited extent, tenants. Some of the problems and successes <b>of</b> <b>sheltered</b> housing are discussed and detailed costings of the major types of dwelling are provided to illustrate the discussion. Alternative forms of care for the elderly are then considered and costings given for these for elderly people requiring varying levels of domiciliary support and having different levels of income. The research {{looks at the}} provision <b>of</b> <b>sheltered</b> housing by housing associations, almshouses and charities in County Durham and discusses the alleged advantages of provision by such bodies. The thesis concludes with a consideration of the future <b>of</b> <b>sheltered</b> housing and looks at some of the factors which might be taken into account when policies for housing the elderly are being formulated...|$|R

5|$|The Uxbridge Cricket Club {{moved from}} Cricketfield Road in 1971 {{to make way}} for the new Civic Centre. The club had been at Cricketfield Road since 1858, but moved to a new site on part of Uxbridge Common on Park Road. The Market Square {{shopping}} precinct in the town centre was built in the late 1970s, but its lack <b>of</b> <b>shelter</b> made it unpopular and it did not attract the expected levels of custom. Many buildings along the High Street and Windsor Street had been demolished {{to make way for}} the new precinct, which was eventually sold to the Prudential Assurance Company and redeveloped with a roof in the early 1980s to become the Pavilions Shopping Centre. The Peacock public house in one of the two main squares was demolished and replaced with a café named The Chequers, which remains. Rayner's pharmacy shop was also demolished during the Market Square development, although the shopfront was saved by the Museum of London and is held in storage.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack on}} the Pindaris was carried out as planned. The Pindaris were attacked, and their homes were {{surrounded}} and destroyed. General Hislop from the Madras Residency attacked the Pindaris {{from the south and}} drove them beyond the Narmada river, where governor general Francis Rawdon-Hastings was waiting with his army. Karim Khan surrendered to the British and was given lands in Gorakhpur. The principal routes from Central India were occupied by British detachments. The Pindari forces were completely broken up, scattered {{in the course of a}} single campaign. They made no stand against the regular troops, and even in small bands they were unable to escape the ring of forces drawn around them. The Pindaris rapidly dispersed over the country. The Pindari chiefs were reduced to the condition of hunted outlaws. The desperate Pindaris expected the Marathas to help them, but none dared to give them even a place <b>of</b> <b>shelter</b> for their families. Karim and Setu had still 23,000 men between them but such a force was no match for the armies that surrounded them. In whatever direction they turned they were met by British forces. Defeat followed defeat. One gang made their escape to the south, leaving all their baggage behind them. Many fled to the jungles and perished. Others sought refuge in the villages, but were killed without mercy by the villagers who had not forgotten the sufferings they had been inflicted upon by the Pindaris. The Pindari chiefs Karim Khan and Wasil Mohammed had been present with their Durras at the battle of Mahidpur. Since by this time the Maratha powers had been reduced significantly, the pursuit of Setu and the other leaders was resumed with vigor. All the leaders had surrendered before the end of February and the Pindari system and power was brought to a close. They were removed to Gorakhptir where they obtained grants of land for their subsistence. Karim Khan became a farmer on the small estate he received beyond the Ganges in Gorakpur. Wasil Mohammed attempted to escape. He was found and committed suicide by taking poison. Setu, a Jat by caste, was hunted by John Malcolm from place to place until he had no followers left. He vanished into the jungles of Central India in 1819 and was killed by a tiger.|$|E
