40|$|Background: The Intravaginal slingplasty {{procedure}} (IVS) is a {{minimally invasive}} surgery for <b>the</b> treatment <b>of</b> stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Too much tension during pulling <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> and <b>the</b> incorrect placing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> can cause urinary retention that may require release <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tape.</b> Case Report: A fifty one years old women with SUI had undergone IVS procedure in a private hospital. After the surgery, urinary retention occurred with prolonged catheterization for 20 days. The patient came to King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital on the 21 st day after the operation. Surgical release <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> which was located at the urethrovesical junction rather than the midurethera was done. The patient remained stress continent after <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> was released confirmed by the videourodynamic study one month later. Conclusion: Too much tension, insertion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> {{too close to the}} urethrovesical junction or <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> migration may be <b>the</b> causes <b>of</b> prolonged urinary retention after IVS procedure. The authors found <b>the</b> surgical release <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> to be <b>the</b> effective management for this complication.

Moya denied such arrangements were in place. He said the gun used at the murder scene was bought in Dallas while he was there, and he remembered seeing it in Garza's home in San Antonio. Records from the gun shop in Dallas showed Garza bought the same type of gun on February 1, 1993. In addition, a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) investigator testified he helped record the suspect's conversations, while a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) technician helped improve the clarity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tapes.</b> The defense attorneys brought in experts to discredit the recordings, and to prove they had been tampered with.|$|E

40|$|In this {{research}} paper, <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> variations in geometry of tape insert on thermal performance and flow characteristics of water inside tubes is investigated {{by means of}} computational fluid dynamics (CFD). <b>The</b> <b>tape</b> considered is alternate-axis triangular cut twisted <b>tape.</b> <b>The</b> perimeter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cuts on <b>the</b> <b>tape,</b> <b>the</b> pitch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> and <b>the</b> width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> were varied.
