While there, he played clarinet {{in the school}} band and became a co-editor (along with [...] Madelyn Pugh) for the Tuesday edition of the school newspaper, The Shortridge Echo. Vonnegut said his tenure with the Echo allowed him to write for a large audience—his fellow students—rather than for a teacher, an experience he said was [...] "fun and easy". [...] "It just turned <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could write better {{than a lot of}} other people", Vonnegut observed. [...] "Each person has something he can do easily and can't imagine why everybody else has so much trouble doing it." ...|$|E

It {{allows me to}} wear a mask". She lives alone and, by her own account, leads a low-key life when she's not working. When asked in an interview what people would {{be surprised to find}} out about her, she responded [...] "I guess people would be surprised to find <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am a bit of a homebody. [...] I do not like clubbing or going to wild parties. [...] After a day of shooting, I love to come home and relax by the fire with a glass of wine and a good book. [...] Boring, huh?" [...] She has expressed interest in taxidermy and entomology. She collects preserved skulls and insects.|$|E
500|$|Haley {{exercised}} discretion over content, guided MalcolmX {{in critical}} stylistic and rhetorical choices, and compiled the work. In the epilogue to the Autobiography, Haley describes an agreement he made with MalcolmX, who demanded that: [...] "Nothing {{can be in}} this book's manuscript that I didn't say and nothing can be left <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> want in it." [...] As such, Haley wrote an addendum to the contract specifically referring to the book as an [...] "as told to" [...] account. In the agreement, Haley gained an [...] "important concession": [...] "I asked for—and he gave—his permission {{that at the end}} of the book I could write comments of my own about him which would not be subject to his review." [...] These comments became the epilogue to the Autobiography, which Haley wrote after the death of his subject.|$|E

It reached No. 8 on Billboard's Top Christian albums chart, and peaked at No. 159 on the Billboard 200 chart, making it his first Billboard 200 album [...] It was produced by Brown Bannister, Ed Cash, and Christopher Stevens. West {{said in an interview}} that all of the album's songs had already been written and the title [...] "Something to Say" [...] had already been decided [...] "months before I found <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was going to have nothing to say." [...] The first radio single released from the album was [...] "You Are Everything". In March 2008, the song reached No. 1 on R's Christian AC chart. [...] "Something to Say", the album's title track, was also released to radio, receiving airplay in June 2008.|$|E
500|$|In January 1980, Michael Stipe met Peter Buck in Wuxtry Records, the Athens {{record store}} where Buck worked. The pair {{discovered}} that they shared similar tastes in music, particularly in punk rock and protopunk artists like Patti Smith, Television, and The Velvet Underground. Stipe said, [...] "It turns <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was buying all the records that [...] was saving for himself." [...] Stipe and Buck soon met fellow University of Georgia students Mike Mills and Bill Berry, who had played music together since high school and lived together in Georgia. The quartet agreed to collaborate on several songs; Stipe later commented that [...] "there was never any grand plan behind any of it". Their still-unnamed band spent a few months rehearsing and played its first show on April 5, 1980, at a friend's birthday party held in a converted Episcopal church in Athens. After considering names like [...] "Twisted Kites", [...] "Cans of Piss", and [...] "Negro Wives", the band settled on [...] "R.E.M." [...] (which stands for the stage of sleep called rapid eye movement), which Stipe selected at random from a dictionary.|$|E
500|$|However, MacFarlane {{was criticized}} for his {{portrayal}} of transsexualism in the Family Guy episode [...] "Quagmire's Dad". Gay novelist Brent Hartinger found the episode's inclusion of transphobic remarks from Peter and Lois Griffin — {{as well as a}} scene of Brian vomiting profusely upon discovering his new girlfriend to be Glenn Quagmire's father – to be [...] "shockingly insensitive". Hartinger continued, [...] "Frankly, it's literally impossible for me to reconcile last night's episode with MacFarlane's words, unless I {{come to the conclusion that}} the man is pretty much a complete idiot". The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, a LGBT media watchdog organization, shared [...] "serious concerns being voiced from members of the community" [...] about the episode. MacFarlane said he was [...] "surprised" [...] by the negative reaction to [...] "Quagmire's Dad", saying that [...] "it seemed that [...] were not picking up on the fact that it was a very sympathetic portrayal of a transsexual character". He further added, [...] "Look, Brian happens to be a heterosexual character, as I am. If I found <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had slept with a transsexual, I might throw up in the same way that a gay guy looks at a vagina and goes, 'Oh, my God, that's disgusting.'" ...|$|E

500|$|In the Gold Medal {{match in}} London, the team faced the Australia women's {{national}} wheelchair basketball team, who had defeated them 48–46 in Sydney {{just a few}} months before, in front of a capacity crowd of over 12,000 at the North Greenwich Arena. The German team had been undefeated up to that point, but had started off slow in its games against the United States and China, winning these games by six-point margins, and seemed to play its best basketball only in the final minutes of a game. Adermann scored 19 points, more than any other player in the match, and was a key factor in Germany winning 58-44. [...] "Most of my shots weren’t even any crazy shots or any outside shots,” Adermann said. [...] "They were the same shots I took in the others games, but I played more in this game, and I had many more easy opportunities getting into the paint." [...] "I’m always one of the shooters, but I think Australia underestimated me and didn’t defend me {{as well as some of}} the other girls. They left me open a lot and I got some big shots, so it went well for me. It just worked <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> scored the most points in the final, but it wasn’t deliberate." ...|$|E
500|$|While Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto {{worked on}} Super Mario World, {{he thought to}} make Yoshi the series' [...] "next hero" [...] since the game {{designer}} {{did not like the}} other Yoshi games, including Yoshi's Safari and Yoshi's Cookie, and thought he could make something more authentic. When he first brought the game to Nintendo marketing, they declined the game for having Mario-style graphics rather than the vogue, computer pre-rendered graphics of Donkey Kong Country. In comparison, they felt that his game lacked the power to impress. Incensed and opposed to the style, Miyamoto instead further escalated his cartoonish visuals into a hand-drawn, crayon style. Nintendo's marketing department accepted this revision. Miyamoto later recalled feeling that the marketing department wanted [...] "better hardware and more beautiful graphics instead of ... art". Around the time of his rejection, Miyamoto allegedly said that [...] "Donkey Kong Country proves that players will put up with mediocre gameplay as long as the art is good". However, he later clarified his remarks, stating that [...] "recently some rumour got <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> didn't really like that game? I just want to clarify that that's not the case, because I was very involved in that. And even emailing almost daily with Tim Stamper right up until the end." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} criticized for its {{portrayal}} of people who identify as transgender, particularly regarding the way Ida was treated by other characters. Food that Ida prepared for the dinner party at the Griffin house was thrown out and Brian's learning of her sex-reassignment surgery after {{he had sex with}} her caused him to [...] "violently" [...] vomit for 30 unbroken seconds. Speaking with LGBT media website AfterElton.com in January 2010, series creator Seth MacFarlane mentioned the episode in response to concerns over how his animated series have portrayed LGBT characters. [...] "It always distresses me when I hear that the gay community is upset with us, because that's one group of people I hope would know we're on their side. I can safely say that the transsexual community will be very, very happy with the 'Quagmire' episode that we have coming up in a couple of months. It's probably the most sympathetic portrayal of a transexual [...] character that has ever been on television, dare I say." [...] In a subsequent review, AfterElton.com writer Brent Hartinger graded the episode negatively. While noting that the episode deserves credit for making important points about transgender people, he found its inclusion of the vomiting scene and Lois and Peter's transphobic remarks about Ida to be [...] "shockingly insensitive". Hartinger continued, [...] "Frankly, it's literally impossible for me to reconcile last night's episode with MacFarlane's words, unless I {{come to the conclusion that}} the man is pretty much a complete idiot." [...] The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, an LGBT media watchdog organization, released a statement about the episode, noting that [...] "GLAAD shares the serious concerns being voiced from members of the community and GLAAD’s Entertainment Media Team is addressing these with Fox. Next steps will be decided at that point." [...] In a September 2010 interview in Details, MacFarlane expressed surprise at the negative reaction, stating [...] "I don't meet a lot of stupid homosexuals." [...] He repeated that he still felt Ida was a [...] "very sympathetic portrayal of a transsexual character". He also defended Brian's vomiting after discovering he had sex with someone who had undergone sex reassignment surgery noting Brian's character is heterosexual and [...] "If I found <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had slept with a transsexual, I might throw up in the same way that a gay guy looks at a vagina and goes, 'Oh, my God, that's disgusting.'" [...] Eames (Digital Spy) believed the episode was [...] "surprisingly kind" [...] to the transgender community for [...] "Family Guy standards".|$|E

2500|$|Stranger in a Strange Land {{was written}} in part as a {{deliberate}} attempt to challenge social mores.

Heinlein completed writing it ten years after he had plotted it out in detail.
