The name of the company, Group Linum-Taussig, shows that it was about Linum (flax). Linum is a genus of approximately 200 species in the flowering plant family Linaceae, native to temperate and subtropical regions of the world. It includes the Common Flax (L. usitatissimum), the bast fibre of {{which is used to}} produce linen and the seeds to produce linseed oil.|$|E

25|$|The {{phasing out}} of the linen export bounty between 1825 and 1832 stimulated demand for cheaper textiles, {{particularly}} for cheaper, tough fabrics. The discovery that the dry fibres <b>of</b> <b>jute</b> could be lubricated with whale oil (of which Dundee had a surfeit, following the opening of its gasworks) {{to allow it to}} be processed in mechanised mills resulted in the Dundee mills rapidly converting from linen to jute, which sold at a quarter of the price of flax. Interruption of Prussian flax imports during the Crimean War and of cotton during the American Civil War resulted in a period of inflated prosperity for Dundee and the jute industry dominated Dundee throughout {{the latter half of the}} 19th century. Unprecedented immigration, notably of Irish workers, led to accelerated urban expansion, and at the height of the industry's success, Dundee supported 62 jute mills, employing some 50,000 workers. Cox Brothers, who owned the massive Camperdown Works in Lochee, were one of the largest jute manufacturers in Europe and employed more than 5,000 workers.|$|E
25|$|The Bengal {{soil profile}} {{impacted}} the famine in two ways. First, {{the soil in}} eastern Bengal, in combination with abundant irrigation from monsoon rains, was unique {{for its ability to}} grow large amounts of high quality jute. This gave Bengal an effective monopoly on a cash crop. Jute of lesser quality was grown in smaller quantities in western Bengal, but eastern Bengal was the clear-cut center <b>of</b> <b>jute</b> production. During the famine, jute-producing districts suffered higher mortality rates. Second, the sandy soil of eastern Bengal and the lighter sedimentary soil of the Sunderbans tended to drain more rapidly after the monsoon season than the laterite or heavy clay regions of western Bengal. As a rule, malaria epidemics lasted approximately one month longer in the areas with slower drainage. This problem was {{compounded by the fact that}} soil exhaustion created the need for large tracts in western and central Bengal to be left fallow; eastern Bengal had far fewer fallow fields. Flooded fallow fields are one key breeding place for malaria carrying mosquitoes, which was the biggest killer during the famine.|$|E
25|$|The Universal Exposition of 1878, {{which lasted}} from 1 May to 10 November 1878, was {{designed}} to advertise the recovery of France from the 1870 Franco-German War {{and the destruction of}} the period of the Paris Commune. It took place {{on both sides of the}} Seine, in the Champ de Mars and the heights of Trocadéro, where the first Palais du Trocadéro was built. Many of the buildings were made of new inexpensive material called staff, which was composed <b>of</b> <b>jute</b> fiber, plaster of Paris, and cement. The main exposition hall was an enormous rectangular structure, the Palace of Machines, where the Eiffel Tower is located today. Inside, Alexander Graham Bell displayed his new telephone and Thomas Edison presented his phonograph. The head of the newly finished Statue of Liberty (Liberty Enlightening the World) was displayed before it was sent to New York City to be attached to the body. Important congresses and conferences took place on the margins of the exposition, including the first congress on intellectual property, led by Victor Hugo, whose proposals led eventually to the first copyright laws, and a conference on education for the blind, which led to the adoption of the Braille system of reading for the blind. The exposition attracted thirteen million visitors, and was a financial success.|$|E

2500|$|When a [...] "reasonable {{picture of}} the {{original}} helmet" [...] was in view, more than nine months of work into the second reconstruction, the repositioned fragments were placed against a [...] "featureless plaster dome." [...] This dome was itself built outwards with [...] "oil-free plasticine" [...] to match the original dimensions of the helmet. The fragments were held in place with [...] "long pins" [...] until a mixture <b>of</b> <b>jute</b> and adhesive was molded {{to the shape of}} the missing areas, and adhered to the fragments. The edges of the fragments were then coated with water-resistant resin, and plaster was spread atop the jute to level and smooth the helmet's surface. The plaster was painted light brown to resemble the colour of the fragments while allowing the fragments themselves to stand out; lines were then drawn to indicate the edges of the panels. The result was a hollow helmet in which the backs of the fragments remain visible. On 2 November 1971, after eighteen months of time and a full year of work by Williams, the second and current reconstruction of the Sutton Hoo helmet was put on display.|$|E
2500|$|In Odisha, {{the festival}} is known as Deepavali (Odia: ଦୀପାବଳୀ). The festival day starts with drawing rangolis {{in front of the}} house. The rangoli is drawn in the shape of {{sailboat}} on {{the ground in front of}} the house and is filled with items such as cotton, salt, mustard, asparagus root, turmeric and a wild creeper. Prasad is placed in the central chamber, over which a deepa of a jute stem with cloth wick is lit. This marks the beginning of Puja. Tarpanam – the ritual meant to invoke the spirits of the ancestors. Immediately after the dusk, all members of household gather for lighting Kaunria (pith of the jute plant). A lighted lamp is placed inside an earthen pot that is tied to a pole erected in front of the house. All the members then hold a bunch <b>of</b> <b>jute</b> stick in their hands and light them from the fire from the main deepa and raise the bunch towards the sky chanting the following verse. Then, in the presence of every member of the house, a bundle of the Kaunria is lit during the Puja and raised skywards accompanied with the chant: [...] "Badbadua ho andhaara re aasa aalua re jaa" [...] meaning [...] "O' forefathers come in the dark of the evening, we light your way to the heaven". The significance of the ritual is that we show respect to our ancestors who reinforce their absence from the physical world by our presence.|$|E

30|$|EA and HEMA are {{hydrophobic}} monomers, and grafting <b>of</b> these onto <b>jute</b> {{filled the}} pith channel <b>of</b> the <b>jute.</b> Grafting with EA and HEMA on the jute fiber might also {{fill up the}} capillary spaces present {{on the surface of}} and inside the fibers.

For, on that sacred day, when in every Church in Christendom his importance as the generalissimo of the angelic host was remembered and commemorated, it seemed hard indeed to the seraph in disguise that he must still guard his incognito, still go on as usual with his petty higgling over corned beef and biscuits and the price <b>of</b> <b>jute</b> sacking. [...] "There was war in heaven," [...] said the gospel for the day--that sonorous gospel Mrs. Trevennack so cordially dreaded--for her husband would always go to church at morning service, and hold himself more erect than was his wont, to hear it--"There was war in heaven; Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, and prevailed not." [...] And should he, who could thus battle against all the powers of evil, be held in check any longer, as with a leash of straw, by the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty? No, no, he would stand forth in his true angelic shape, and show these martinets what form they had ignorantly taken for mere Michael Trevennack of the Victualing Department! ...|$|E

It was in the dock in Dundee, where we had brought a full cargo <b>of</b> <b>jute</b> from Calcutta. We had been paid off that morning, and I had come on board to take my sea-chest away and to say good-bye. In his slightly lofty but courteous way he inquired what were my plans. I replied that I intended leaving for London by the afternoon train, and thought of going up for examination to get my master's certificate. I had just enough service for that.
