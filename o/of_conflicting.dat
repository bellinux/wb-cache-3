5|$|Harper's {{relationship}} with Manning became strained in 1992, because <b>of</b> <b>conflicting</b> strategies over the Charlottetown Accord. Harper opposed the Accord on principle for ideological reasons, while Manning was initially {{more open to}} compromise. Harper also criticized Manning's decision to hire Rick Anderson as an adviser, believing that Anderson was not sufficiently committed to the Reform Party's principles. He resigned as policy chief in October 1992.|$|E
5|$|The Mary Rose {{was one of}} {{the largest}} ships in the English navy through more than three decades of {{intermittent}} war and {{was one of the}} earliest examples of a purpose-built sailing warship. She was armed with new types of heavy guns that could fire through the recently invented gun-ports. After being substantially rebuilt in 1536, she was also one of the earliest ships that could fire a broadside, although the line of battle tactics that employed it had not yet been developed. Several theories have sought to explain the demise of the Mary Rose, based on historical records, knowledge of 16th-century shipbuilding, and modern experiments. The precise cause of her sinking is still unclear, because <b>of</b> <b>conflicting</b> testimonies and a lack of conclusive physical evidence.|$|E
5|$|The first gambier {{and pepper}} {{plantations}} appeared in Southern Johor, notably Skudai. Lau Lib Keng, a Chinese settler based in Skudai, {{was the first}} person to receive a Surat Sungai, whereby the river banks of Skudai were leased to Lau for the cultivation of gambier and pepper. More Chinese settlers came to Johor from the 1850s onwards, and forested areas in Southern Johor such as Tebrau, Plentong and Stulang were cleared for the cultivation of gambier and pepper. By the time Temenggong Ibrahim's son, Abu Bakar took office from his father in 1862, at least 37 Surat Sungai have been issued to various Kangchu, all of whom were collectively responsible for the operations of the 1,200 gambier and pepper farms in the state. Most of these Chinese leaders were also members of secret societies, and communal warfare often broke out in Singapore between different dialect groups as a result <b>of</b> <b>conflicting</b> economic interests. From the late 1850s onwards, the Kangchu began to exert political influence in the state affairs by establishing close ties with Temenggong Abu Bakar. In 1865, Abu Bakar granted official recognition to the Teochew-dominated Johor branch of the Ngee Heng Kongsi after a Kangchu, Tan Kee Soon, raised a small army to subdue Sultan Ali's forces, from whom Abu Bakar was facing considerable dissent but was unable to raise an organised army. Abu Bakar nevertheless called for the Ngee Heng Kongsi to accept Chinese settlers of other dialect groups to prevent possible communal warfare as a result <b>of</b> <b>conflicting</b> economic interests.|$|E

40|$|<b>Conflicts</b> <b>of</b> {{interests}} arise due to {{the fact}} that a person’s right to demand to act in his interests imposes a duty on another person to act in such a way. Different concepts <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> interests used in various sectors and their problems are analyzed in the article. Whereas there is no unified concept <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> interests used in practice it is unclear which types of relations are regarded as <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> interests, when <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> interests arises and what are the solutions to it. Due to these reasons universal concept <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> interests is constructed and elements <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> interests are analyzed in this article. The concept <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> interests is discussed in the context of agency theory in the broad sense, i. e. in the legal and economic sense. Theoretical model and types <b>of</b> <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> interests are particularly important while trying to solve <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> interests. There are two main categories of solutions: preventive and managing measures. Preventive measures are intended to avoid <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> interests before it arises and managing measures are intended to manage already risen <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> interests and to prevent negative consequences.

5|$|While the dinosaur-bird {{connection}} (or lack thereof) {{was being}} pursued in paleontology, {{the problem of}} the evolution of flight was under scrutiny as well. It was observed that a number of animals with moderate flying or gliding ability, such as bats, flying lizards and flying squirrels have arboreal lifestyles. This led to the idea that the ancestors of birds must have gradually acquired the ability to fly from leaping among branches in the tops of trees. The Hungarian paleontologist Franz Nopcsa proposed an alternate hypothesis in 1907, arguing that the ancestors of birds were fast-running, bipedal animals related to theropod dinosaurs. When Heilmann came onto the paleontology scene, these two sets <b>of</b> <b>conflicting</b> theories provided the framework for his research and eventual conclusions.|$|E
5|$|Another {{criticism}} of Kohlberg’s {{theory is that}} people frequently demonstrate significant inconsistency in their moral judgements. This often occurs in moral dilemmas involving drinking and driving and business situations where participants {{have been shown to}} reason at a subpar stage, typically using more self-interest driven reasoning (i.e., stage two) than authority and social order obedience driven reasoning (i.e., stage four). Kohlberg’s theory is generally considered to be incompatible with inconsistencies in moral reasoning. Carpendale has argued that Kohlberg’s theory should be modified to focus on the view that the process of moral reasoning involves integrating varying perspectives of a moral dilemma rather than simply fixating on applying rules. This view would allow for inconsistency in moral reasoning since individuals may be hampered by their inability to consider different perspectives. Krebs and Denton have also attempted to modify Kohlberg’s theory to account for a multitude <b>of</b> <b>conflicting</b> findings, but eventually concluded that the theory is not equipped to take into consideration how most individuals make moral decisions in their everyday lives.|$|E
5|$|Following World War I, the {{dissolution}} of Austria-Hungary, and the Treaty of Trianon, Hungary lost its possessions in the region. In 1918, a short-lived, unrecognised State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs was formed out of parts of Austria-Hungary, comprising most of the former monarchy's Adriatic coastline and the entire present-day Croatian Littoral. Later that year, the Kingdom of Serbia and the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs formed the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes—subsequently renamed to Yugoslavia. The new union's proponents {{at the time in}} the Croatian Parliament saw the move as a defence against Italian expansionism such as via provisions of the 1915 Treaty of London. The treaty was largely disregarded by Britain and France because <b>of</b> <b>conflicting</b> promises made to Serbia and a perceived lack of Italian contribution to the war effort outside Italy itself.|$|E

5|$|The May Revolution was not {{the product}} of the actions of a single {{political}} party with a clear and defined agenda, but a convergence of sectors with varying interests. Thus, there are a number <b>of</b> <b>conflicting</b> perspectives about it, because different authors highlight different aspects.

5|$|Much of Suffolk's early {{activity}} in East Anglian local politics was probably at the instigation of his mother, Alice, {{and he would}} later spend as much {{of his adult life}} at her manor of Ewelme as he did at his own manors. Suffolk played a prominent role in Commissions of the Peace in Norfolk and Suffolk, and these became a permanent position from 1464. On at least two occasions, Suffolk attempted to affect the outcome of a local parliamentary election, and the appointment of the county sheriff. Furthermore, he was a justice of the peace in Berkshire and Oxfordshire in the later 1460s. He involved himself {{in some of the most}} controversial episodes in East Anglian society of the time, for instance, attempting to purchase part of the by-then somewhat infamous Fastolf inheritance in 1461. This was another occasion in fact where we may in fact see his mother's guiding hand at work, as she is known to have been canvassing for support at court for such an outcome, and even Margaret Paston believed her to be personally behind the attacks. Both of them were involved in a severe feud with the Paston family as a result <b>of</b> <b>conflicting</b> interests in the Fastolf inheritance. The duke also made other disputed (and in some cases outrightly illegal) claims to other properties in the region over the following decade, and in 1465, a group of his retainers destroyed the manor house of Hellesdon, ransacking its church. For these and other illegalities alleged by contemporaries, Suffolk escaped retribution, probably due to his royal connections. On the other hand, he was never able to use such connections to his advantage and persuade the king to intercede in any disputes on the duke's behalf.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} an attempt to come to a better {{understanding}} of desire through an examination of certain kinds <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> desire.
