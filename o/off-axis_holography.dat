30|$|In {{contrast}} to <b>off-axis</b> <b>holography,</b> in-line holography implies no direct restrictions concerning {{the region of}} interest on the specimen or the microscope equipment because neither a biprism nor a vacuum reference beam is needed. However, the phase reconstruction procedure is more complex compared to <b>off-axis</b> <b>holography.</b> This sets indirect restrictions on the microscope {{in order to avoid}} artifacts. Since all differences between images of different defocus that are not related to phase changes generate artifacts, an aberration-corrected microscope is advantageous and focus-dependent changes of the magnification and rotation as well as image distortion should be minimized. Furthermore, the field of view within which the TIE reconstruction is valid is related to the coherence length of the electron beam. Therefore, a highly (spatially) coherent electron source is required to allow reliable reconstruction within a few tens of nanometers [25, 31]. Finally, external fields or the presence of diffraction effects which are largely unavoidable in polycrystalline materials introduce artifacts as well. The latter depends mainly on the material and is especially pronounced in in-line holography, as the diffraction effects strongly vary with defocus.|$|E

The reconstructed image in the Fresnel hologram is deformed along new viewing direction, whereas the Fourier hologram enables to retrieve three-dimensional image with other perspective. High resolution hologram fringe is imaged on the image plane through an imaging system, and thus, only collection of diffracted beams increases a viewing zone angle. We verify our proposal through the numerical analysis for the sampled hologram showing high-order diffraction beams with various viewing zones. Comment: 22 pages, 11 figure...|$|E

40|$|As {{semiconductor}} device dimensions {{are reduced to}} the deep sub-micron regime, minor departures from the designed distributions of electrostatic potentials can affect device performance dramatically. Parameter optimisation in device processing and modelling is crucial for achieving precise potential profiles. Such optimisation is not possible without comprehensive feedback from advanced characterisation techniques. The ability to acquire two- and three-dimensional measurements of potential distributions with high spatial resolution, high precision and under an applied electrical bias is therefore in great demand. The technique of <b>off-axis</b> electron <b>holography</b> in the transmission electron microscope (TEM) promises to fulfil these requirements in two dimensions and can be combined with electron tomography for three-dimensional measurements. In this dissertation, the practical challenges {{that are involved in}} the application of electron holography to the characterisation of electrostatic potentials in working MOSFETs are addressed. A novel method for the application of electrical contacts to a TEM specimen is developed and applied to a diode structure. <b>Off-axis</b> electron <b>holography</b> measurements are carried out on a pn junction using both this and an alternative geometry and compared with simulations. A semi-biased MOSFET is then characterised successfully using electron holography, suggesting that the examination of working transistors in the TEM is a realistic prospect.

The holograms which were obtained with a biprism voltage (lower biprism) of 193 V, reveal a fringe contrast of 13.8  %, a fringe spacing of 1.17 nm, and a hologram width of 450 nm. In the case of 226 V applied voltage on the second biprism, the hologram width remains 450 nm, but the fringe spacing decreases to 0.95 nm while the fringe contrast is reduced to 7.7  %.

40|$|Inverse problem {{approaches}} for image reconstruction can improve resolution recovery over spatial filtering methods while reducing interference artifacts in digital <b>off-axis</b> <b>holography.</b> Prior works implemented explicit regularization operators {{in the image}} space and were only able to match intensity measurements approximatively. As a consequence, convergence to a strictly compatible solution was not possible. In this paper, we replace the non-convex image reconstruction problem for a sequence of surrogate convex problems. An iterative numerical solver is designed using a simple projection operator in the data domain and a Nesterov acceleration of the simultaneous Kaczmarz method. For regularization, the complex-valued object wavefield image is represented in the multiresolution CDF 9 / 7 wavelet domain and an energy-weighted preconditioning promotes minimum-norm solutions. Experiments demonstrate improved resolution recovery and reduced spurious artifacts in reconstructed images. Furthermore, the method is resilient to additive Gaussian noise and subsampling of intensity measurements. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

In-line holography {{is based on the}} extraction of the phase of the propagating electron wave deduced from the electron beam intensity measured at different defocus. Two different strategies have been proposed in literature to reconstruct the phase information from a focal series: either the phase information is retrieved by iterative algorithms (e.g., [24]) or by the transport of intensity equation (TIE) (e.g., [30]). In contrast to iterative reconstruction routines which require high computational effort, the TIE allows to calculate the phase variation in a direct approach.
