5|$|Between {{the large}} pendentives {{that support the}} vault are windows, six {{on each side of}} the chapel. There were two more windows in each end of the chapel, now closed, and those above the High Altar covered by the Last Judgement. Above each window is an arched shape, {{referred}} to as a lunette and above eight of the lunettes at the sides of the chapel are triangular spandrels filling the spaces between the side pendentives and the vault, the other eight lunettes each being below one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> pendentives.|$|E
5|$|The failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> left Otto {{unable to}} meet his {{obligations}} and sent his brokerage house, Gross & Kleeberg, into bankruptcy. On Thursday, October 17, the New York Stock Exchange suspended Otto's trading privileges. As a result of United Copper's collapse, the State Savings Bank of Butte Montana (owned by F. Augustus Heinze) announced its insolvency. The Montana bank had held United Copper stock as collateral against some of its lending and had been a correspondent bank for the Mercantile National Bank in New York City, of which F. Augustus Heinze was then president.|$|E

5|$|Opposite the {{carriage}} barn is another building, also of brick {{but with a}} low hip roof. It is one story high, one bay deep and five bays wide. There are three sets of overhead doors on the main (south) facade of the building. A high brick wall encloses the entire complex, and sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> utility structures {{are a part of}} the surrounding wall. There is a small building in the northeast corner of the complex; it is one bay square with a steep hip roof with spring eaves. It has single round windows near the root line, on two facades. The building's entrance, on the south facade, is made of wood. The building has a counterpart across the yard, with a low hip roof, a large brick chimney, and a stone water table and string course; it has overhead doors on the north facade.|$|E
5|$|Maricello's super soft tyres {{began to}} degrade quickly, {{allowing}} Rossi and Vandoorne to draw closer {{over the next}} two laps. Rossi caught Maricello by the start of the sixth lap but the latter remained on the circuit. King, who was delayed by a long queue of vehicles behind him, was the first driver to make a scheduled pit stop on the same lap and rejoined the track in clear air. On lap eight, Matsushita collided heavily with de Jong at the Novelle chicane, causing him to retire and was later penalised with a three-place grid penalty for the sprint race after the stewards judged him to have missed the corner's braking point. De Jong was able to continue. Marciello made his pit stop for new tyres on the next lap, allowing Rossi and Vandoorne to move into the first and second places and both drivers built an advantage over the remainder of the field. Maricello rejoined in eleventh, behind Pic, who made his pit stop one lap later. Sørensen was placed into the Casino Hairpin barriers at the apex <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> by Nato on lap ten, ending his race. Nato was issued with a ten-second time penalty, but no safety car was deployed. Marvelov retired from the race in the pit lane with damage to his car after running off the circuit, and drove over a kerb exiting the left-hand Louis Chiron corner, causing him to become airborne, and hit the barriers lining the track.|$|E
5|$|Tracy {{moved into}} the first {{position}} three laps later with Gidley running in his draft to clinch second place. Gidley drove {{to the outside of}} the track and got ahead of Tracy for the position entering the first turn. Castroneves took over first place when he passed Gidley on lap 16, but lost it to Papis two laps later. Gidley reclaimed the position on the 22nd lap, but Castroneves passed him three laps later. Da Matta and Castroneves shared first place over the following two laps. Papis retook the lead from Castroneves on the 31st lap. The first caution of the race was prompted on the following lap when Bräck spun and made heavy contact with the turn two outside wall and stopped at the bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner.</b> He was uninjured but retired from the race. All of the leaders elected to make pit stops for fuel. Papis remained the leader at the lap-45 restart, and was followed by Castroneves. Kanaan {{moved into the}} lead by lap 50, but Papis retook the position around the outside of turn one on the following lap. Gidley moved back into the lead by overtaking Papis {{on the inside of the}} first turn.|$|E

25|$|But with {{a knight}} pawn (see the diagram on the right), the {{attacker}} has no file equivalent to 2... Rh2, {{so he can}} not make progress. Here, the defender should avoid the active defense (attacking the pawn from behind while {{it is on the}} fifth with the rook). It fails because his king will be forced to the long side (stepping the other way would lose immediately because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner,</b> allowing immediate mate).|$|E
25|$|The role of {{the half}} backs who wear the 5 (right) and 7 (left) jerseys is less {{defensive}} than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> backs. The half backs operate most often in between the 45-metre line and the midfield. The half backs are expected to defend against the opposition's half forward line but also {{has a responsibility to}} make runs from the 45-metre line to advance the play to the half forward and full forward lines.|$|E

25|$|Floaters {{are able}} to catch and refract light in ways that {{somewhat}} blur vision temporarily until the floater moves to a different area. Often they trick persons who are troubled by floaters into thinking they see something out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> of their eye that really is not there. Most persons {{come to terms with}} the problem, after a time, and learn to ignore their floaters. For persons with severe floaters it is nearly impossible to completely ignore the large masses that constantly stay within almost direct view.|$|E
25|$|Away {{fans for}} league matches were {{originally}} accommodated {{in the upper}} level, in the north west corner, which can hold a maximum of 3,000 fans. However, plans were made {{at the end of}} the 2007–2008 season to relocate the away supporters to the far end of the upper level of the Leazes End. This location has attracted criticism due to the poor view offered by being so far from the pitch due the height of the stand, and the 14 flights of stairs to reach the upper level. For FA Cup matches the lower section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> is also used.|$|E
