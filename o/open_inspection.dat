Grass expressed his concern about the hypocrisy of German military support (the delivery of a submarine) for an Israel that might use such equipment to launch nuclear warheads against Iran, which [...] "could wipe out the Iranian people". And he hoped that many would demand [...] "that the governments of both Iran and Israel allow an international authority free and <b>open</b> <b>inspection</b> of the nuclear potential and capability of both."

40|$|A {{system and}} method for {{refurbishing}} and processing parachutes is disclosed including an overhead monorail conveyor system {{on which the}} parachute is suspended for horizontal conveyance. The parachute is first suspended in a partially opened tented configuration wherein <b>open</b> <b>inspection</b> of the canopy is permitted to remove debris and inspect all areas. Following inspection, the parachute is transported by the monorail conveyor to a washing and drying station with the parachute canopy mounted on the conveyor in a systematic arrangement which permits water and air {{to pass through the}} ribbon-like materials of the canopy. Following drying, the chute is conveyed into an interior space where it is finally inspected and removed from the monorial conveyor for folding. The chute is once again mounted on the conveyor and conveyed to a packing area...|$|E
40|$|Building upon {{a recent}} study that showed windbreaks to be {{effective}} in increasing the power output of a wind turbine, the potential of windbreaks in a large wind farm is explored using simplified formulations. A top-down boundary layer approach is combined with methods of estimating both the roughness effects of windbreaks and the induced inviscid speed-up for nearby turbines to investigate power production impact for several layouts of infinite wind farms. Results suggest that the negative impact of windbreak wakes for an infinite wind farm will outweigh the local inviscid speed-up for realistic inter-turbine spacings, with the break-even point expected at a spacing of ∼ 25 rotor diameters. However, the possibility that windbreaks may be applicable in finite and other wind farm configurations remains <b>open.</b> <b>Inspection</b> of the windbreak porosity reveals an impact on the magnitude of power perturbation, but not whether the change is positive or negative. Predictions from the boundary-layer approach are validated with power measurements from large-eddy simulations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Due to {{the entry}} of Kuwait into WTO and the {{expected}} liberalization of petroleum management, the oil market is to become more competitive. However, the space limitation and public increasing awareness of environmental protection issues and stricter regulation passed by Environmental Public Authority (EPA) in Kuwait make the need for full utilization of oil tanks a prime requirement of a successful oil business. In order to help oil companies to achieve this and maximize revenues by increasing the availability of tanks, an efficient maintenance scheduling is needed. This study introduces a new hybrid evolutionary algorithm and its implantation for solving real-world problem of oil storage tanks. The algorithm incorporates the American Petroleum Institute (API) standard 650 for <b>open</b> <b>inspection</b> procedure to produce a near optimal schedule for maintenance though continuously preserving a population diversity that ensures solution quality and convergence efficiency. The computational {{results show that the}} proposed evolutionary algorithm outperforms existing scheduler in literature and produces a higher quality solution which means better revenues though more operational tanks and more environmental protection though maximizing the utilization of existing tanks and less new tanks to build...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Sharp {{division}} of the A 1 pulley is a time-honored technique {{for the treatment of}} flexor tendon entrapment; however, this procedure is not without complications. The anatomy of the A 1 pulley system has been carefully investigated. Knowledge of superficial anatomic landmarks can assist with demarcating the distal edge of the A 1 pulley and prevent damage to the critical A 2 pulley. Methods: Nine fresh cadaveric hands were dissected with the aid of loupe magnification. On the basis of known anatomic landmarks of the proximal portion of the cruciate (C 0) pulley, percutaneous placement of a 25 -gauge needle 5 mm proximal to the palmar digital crease marked the distal extent of the trigger finger release. Sharp {{division of}} the A 1 pulley was performed with a scalpel until the needle was encountered, thus completing the release. Results: A complete release of the pulley was achieved in all specimens with preservation of the A 2 pulley. No digital nerve or artery injuries were noted with <b>open</b> <b>inspection</b> of the flexor sheath. Conclusion: Percutaneous marking of the distal extent of the A 1 pulley is a safe and reliable method that not only ensures complete release of the A 1 pulley but also preserves the A 2 pulley. The placement of a small gauge needle adds no morbidity to this minimally invasive technique...|$|E
40|$|There is an adage about {{wealth and}} {{democracy}} that says “the more well-to-do a nation, {{the greater the}} chances it will sustain democracy. ” Accordingly, {{one would expect that}} nations rich in natural resources, and particularly those with large deposits of oil – a clear absolute advantage – would shine far beyond all others as beacons of democracy and freedom. Unfortunately, nothing seems further from the truth. Studies undoubtedly show that oil dependence leads to a skewing of political forces. It concentrates production to geographic enclaves and concentrates power into the hands of a few elites. It becomes a fisherman’s market for rent-seeking behavior, where those with money jockey for positions and influence to acquire lucrative contracts, the revenues from which are used to further bribe and manipulate those in power. Consequently, those in power secure the positions of their benefactors, creating a vicious circle of corruption and patronage, secured from <b>open</b> <b>inspection</b> of a free press, public accountability, or standards of international business and political practice. They tend to have stratified social classes with a tiny minority earning millions while a vast portion of the population wallow in abject poverty. How is it possible to be so rich, yet so poor? Is this phenomenon, known as the “oil curse,” or in social science parlance, the “resource curse” truly to blame? Does oil really impede democracy and economic growth? “Revisiting the oil curse: are oil rich nations really doomed to autocracy and inequality?” addresses precisely these questions, and the answers are no less than disturbing. ...|$|E

40|$|Underground mining {{operations}} usually require {{a number of}} vertical (or near vertical) shafts to allow movement of rock (ore) or air (ventilation) between different levels within a mine.
