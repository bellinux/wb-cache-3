5000|$|An {{example of}} a {{component}} that passes all the tests is a car's <b>occupant</b> <b>restraint</b> system. While we do not normally think of the primary <b>occupant</b> <b>restraint</b> system, it is gravity. If the vehicle rolls over or undergoes severe g-forces, then this primary method of <b>occupant</b> <b>restraint</b> may fail. Restraining the occupants during such an accident is absolutely critical to safety, so we pass the first test. Accidents causing occupant ejection were quite common before seat belts, so we pass the second test. The cost of a redundant restraint method like seat belts is quite low, both economically {{and in terms of}} weight and space, so we pass the third test. Therefore, adding seat belts to all vehicles is an excellent idea. Other [...] "supplemental restraint systems", such as airbags, are more expensive and so pass that test by a smaller margin.|$|E

25|$|In addition, NIOSH {{researchers}} are pursuing {{a line of}} research related to ambulance safety. In the U.S., an ambulance {{may be one of}} a number of vehicle body types, and there are no comprehensive safety standards that specify requirements for safety and crashworthiness. Of special concern is the safety of workers in the ambulance patient compartment, where work tasks are not compatible with the use of <b>occupant</b> <b>restraints</b> and where equipment and interior layout put workers at high risk of injury in the event of a crash. Sled and crash tests of ambulances conducted by NIOSH and partners show that retrofitting patient compartments with redesigned <b>occupant</b> <b>restraints</b> will allow EMS workers the level of mobility needed to care for patients and at the same time afford greater protection from injury than standard lap belts. NIOSH work in this area has led to development of new voluntary standards for crash-testing of ambulances. The research program has now expanded to address the full range of human-factors concerns about worker safety in ambulance patient compartment, with a number of other manufacturing standards and testing standards in progress.|$|R

40|$|Accidents {{involving}} bus rollover can {{be classified}} {{as one of the}} most fatal types compared to other types of motor-vehicle accident. There are various aspects that lead to occupant injury and fatality. Two prominent aspects are superstructure strength and occupant kinematics. This study deals with the two stages of analyses which are superstructure strength having rollover and occupants kinematic analysis. In accordance to UNECE R 66, the bus superstructure should be able to withstand the impact load produced by the rollover accident. The validation process using finite element model was done by comparing the strain results obtained from simple box rollover experiment with the simulation results. A total of four full-scale models of the bus superstructures had undergone rollover simulation using finite element analysis software. The predicted results suggested that the structural strength having rollover strongly depends on the bus design parameters in terms of the beam profile size and main bus dimensions.

40|$|Objective: The goal of {{this project}} was to {{describe}} the characteristics related to motor vehicle transportation among wheelchair users, who remain in their wheelchair while in the vehicle. Particular focus was placed on identifying how these individuals utilize <b>occupant</b> <b>restraint</b> and wheelchair securement devices. Also, the study examined the epidemiology of motor vehicle related injuries, and reports {{on the relationship between}} these injuries and the identified use of <b>occupant</b> <b>restraint</b> and wheelchair securement systems. Methods: A 12 -page survey was completed, via mail, by 336 wheelchair users, who self-reported that they remain seated in their wheelchair at least some point in their transportation use. These individuals were recruited through various nationwide disability related service and advocacy organizations, as well as through disability related internet message boards. Descriptive, chi-square and t-test analysis was completed using SPSS statistical software. Results: The results of this study show that traveling as a private vehicle passenger is the most common manner in which motor vehicle transportation is used by wheelchair occupants, with 70. 2 % of the sample population reporting to using this mode within the past month and 50. 0 % reporting this mode as their primary means of transportation. Limited significant difference existed in regard to subject's gender, age, disability or wheelchair type and the reported use of either an <b>occupant</b> <b>restraint</b> device or a wheelchair securement system. There were also limited significant findings seen in regard to the use of either an <b>occupant</b> <b>restraint</b> device or wheelchair securement system and the occurrence/severity of a motor vehicle crash, or non-crash related injury. Finally, in regard to motor vehicle related adverse events that resulted in an injury, descriptive statistics showed that there were limited events (crash: n = 15, non-crash: n = 71), with even less resulting in an injury requiring the need to seek medical attention (crash: n = 10, non-crash: n = 9). Conclusion: This study {{is one of the first}} efforts to describe the real-world transportation characteristics of wheelchair-seated passengers, as well as an examination of the relationship between the use of either occupant restraints or wheelchair securement devices and the occurrence of motor vehicle related injuries. These data demonstrate that private vehicles are the most widely used form of motor vehicle transportation, suggesting that research focused in this area may be beneficial. Also, limited significant findings were seen in regard to the relationships between the use of either an <b>occupant</b> <b>restraint</b> or wheelchair securement, independent of each other, and the occurrence of motor vehicle related injuries. These results may be interpreted in two ways 1) that these safety systems are not being used effectively, or 2) that use of an <b>occupant</b> <b>restraint</b> and wheelchair securement independent of one another may not reduce injury risk in a motor vehicle crash or non-crash incident. The analysis of the use of a 3 -point <b>occupant</b> <b>restraint,</b> together with a forward facing wheelchair securement system, as recommended by the SAE J 2249, may produce different results. It should also be noted that based on descriptive statistics alone, it is evident that for those individuals who were injured severely enough in a non-crash incident to require medical attention, there was limited reported usage of wheelchair securement and occupant restraints. These findings may suggest that the use of such devices may decrease the number of severe non-crash related injuries. Based on the limitations of this study and trends seen within the descriptive statistics, more research in this area is required to develop more inferential findings between the use of these devices and the occurrence of injuries related to motor vehicle transportation...|$|E

In 2002 field investigators estimated that the fatality rate for EMS workers was more than 2 times the national average for all workers. As part of the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA), researchers at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) set out to reduce ambulance crash - related injuries and deaths among EMS workers. Research addressed the layout and structural integrity of ambulance compartments, design of hardware, and <b>occupant</b> <b>restraints.</b> NIOSH research revealed a number of important factors involved in ambulance worker injuries and deaths. For example, field investigators observed that EMS workers often ride on the squad bench without wearing a restraint. This allows them to lean forward, stand up, or change positions as needed to reach the patient or equipment, but places them at higher risk of striking bulkheads, cabinets, shelves, or other occupants during a crash. NIOSH crash tests also revealed the possibility of head injury if a worker's head strikes the cabinets immediately above or behind them, and noted that vehicle structural failures can be a contributing factor in adverse outcomes of EMS crashes.

In response to reports of golf cart related injuries in a North Carolina island community, we reviewed ambulance call report (ACR) information to identify and describe all injuries related to golf cart operation in this community in 1992 - 4. We also conducted telephone interviews with the subset of injured people who consented to be contacted. SETTING: Bald Head Island, North Carolina. RESULTS: Twenty two people {{were included in the}} case series, and 55 % of these provided interview information to supplement ACR data. Fifty nine per cent of the 22 injured people were injured when they fell from a moving golf cart; of those injured in this manner, all with available information on seating position were passengers (rather than drivers). Eighty six per cent received immediate medical treatment at a mainland hospital. Thirty two per cent of injury incidents occurred among children aged 10 or younger. Forty per cent of injured adults were known to have been drinking alcohol before their injuries occurred, while alcohol was not known to have been involved in any of the children's injuries (in terms of drinking either by children or by accompanying adults).
