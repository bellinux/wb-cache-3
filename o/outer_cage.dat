25|$|A Farnsworth-Hirsch fusor {{consists}} of two wire cages, one inside the other, {{often referred to as}} grids, that are placed inside a vacuum chamber. The <b>outer</b> <b>cage</b> has a positive voltage versus the inner cage. Typically, deuterium gas is injected into this chamber. It is heated past its ionization temperature, making positive ions. The ions are positive and move towards the negative inner cage. Those that miss the wires of the inner cage fly {{through the center of the}} device at high speeds and can fly out the other side of the inner cage. As the ions move outward, they feel a Coulomb force that directs them back towards the center. Over time, a core of ionized gas can form inside the inner cage. Ions pass back and forth through the core until they strike either the grid or another nucleus. Most nucleus strikes do not result in fusion. Grid strikes can raise the temperature of the grid as well as eroding it. These strikes conduct mass and energy away from the plasma.|$|E

5000|$|The {{best known}} IEC device is the fusor. [...] This device {{typically}} {{consists of two}} wire cages inside a vacuum chamber. These cages {{are referred to as}} grids. The inner cage is held at a negative voltage against the <b>outer</b> <b>cage.</b> A small amount of fusion fuel is introduced (deuterium gas being the most common). The voltage between the grids causes the fuel to ionize. The positive ions fall down the voltage drop towards the negative inner cage. As they accelerate, the electric field does work on the ions, heating them to fusion conditions. If these ions collide, they can fuse. Fusors can also use ion guns rather than electric grids. Fusors are popular with amateurs, because they can be easy to construct, can regularly produce fusion and are a practical way to study nuclear physics. Fusors have also been used as a commercial neutron generator for industrial applications.|$|E

40|$|Double cage {{induction}} motors {{are typically}} employed in applications that require high starting torque for frequent, loaded starts. This makes the starting (<b>outer)</b> <b>cage</b> susceptible to fatigue failure since it must withstand the large thermo-mechanical stress {{associated with the}} high starting current and long acceleration time.

40|$|Purpose. To {{determine}} {{the efficiency of}} rope blocks, {{it is necessary to}} {{determine the}} stiffness coefficient of the ropes of blocks, taking into account the classification group of the mechanism and the wrapping angle of a block by a rope. At this one should use well-tested values of the efficiency coefficients of the rope blocks, taking into account the wrapping angle of a block by a rope and the analytically found friction coefficients of the rolling bearings given to the trunnion. Methodology. The work presents the analytical method of determining the coefficient of bearing resistance of the block when it is rotated by both the inner and <b>outer</b> <b>cages,</b> as well as the design scheme of the bearing of the block. Findings. The analysis of the lubrication method effect, the operating mode of the mechanism and the wrapping angle of a block by a rope on losses in bearings was carried out for rope blocks. The corresponding comparative tables of losses are given. Analysis of the obtained calculation results allows us to establish: 1) the main resistance affecting the cable blocks efficiency is the resistance in bearings; 2) the second largest component is the stiffness losses, depending on the operating mode, the wrapping angle of a block by a rope, the type of bearing lubrication; 3) the block efficiency when rotating the inner cage is higher than rotating the outer one by about 3 % with thick lubrication and 1 M mode; 4) in the sequential location of assemblies with a rolling bearing, it is necessary to strive for the design of the assembly in which the inner cage rotates; 5) with the number of blocks up to 5, one can use the recommended definitions of block bearings in the literature with an error in the efficiency value of up to 10 %. Originality. The authors obtained values of resistances in the rolling bearings of the rope blocks and stiffness losses due to the girth of the block by the rope. In this case, dependences were used to determine the coefficient of rolling friction, obtained using the Hertz analytic dependences on determination of contact stresses and deformations, as well as the experimental values of the coefficient of rolling friction for the blocks.

40|$|Purpose. About one of {{the causes}} of slip rolling is known from {{the second half of the}} 19 th century, it was {{believed}} that the slip resistance appears at the place of contact due to different speeds on the arc of contact. Only in the mid- 20 th century it was proved that this resistance is negligible in rolling resistance. However (for some unknown reason) it is ignored the fact that in practice in rolling bearings may rotate both the inner ring with a stationary outer one, and vice versa almost in equal relations. It is not taken into account the fact that the ball or roller in the rolling bearings runs the different distance along the roller path of the outer and inner bearing cages in one revolution. This fact is not taken into account in determining the calculated values for the friction coefficient of a rolling bearing reduced to the shaft. Therefore, the aim of this work is to determine the influence of path length on the track riding the outer and inner race of the bearing on the determination of the calculated value of the coefficient of friction of rolling bearings is given to the shaft. Methodology. The solution technique is based on the theory of plane motion of a rigid body, the theory of Hertzian contact deformation and the analytical dependencies for determination of coefficient of rolling friction. Findings. The obtained dependences on determination of rolling resistance of the balls or rollers along the bearing tracks of inner and <b>outer</b> bearing <b>cages</b> as well as path difference metering of the rolling on them allows to analytically obtain the rolling resistance and slipping for any size of bearings and different devices of bearing units. It is also possible at the design stage of rolling nodes to handle not only the design but also the content of the node. Originality. Using the analytical dependences for determination of the rolling resistance of bodies at point and line contacts, and also account for the difference in the path of the rolling ball or roller on the <b>outer</b> and inner <b>cages</b> of the bearing one can more accurately find the rolling resistance in the bearings.

Six modified cages featured {{the addition of a}} 1 m wide <b>outer</b> <b>cage</b> surrounding a 10 m square inner cage stocked with intensively fed channel catfish (Ictalarus punctatus). Outer cages were stocked with filter-feeding herbivorous fish including, bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis), common carp (Cyprinus carpio), and Nile tilapia (Oreochromis nilocticus). These species fed on phytoplankton, particulate waste from the inner cage, and periphyton, thereby retaining nutrients and possibly improving water quality around the cages. This experiment compared phosphorus balances of modified cages with three traditional cages also stocked with channel catfish, but which did not include an <b>outer</b> <b>cage.</b> Additional experiments compared growth rates of fish in outer cages to fish in a control cage distant from any impacts of intensively fed inner cages.

This method provides a fixed TPC-external reference system (by contrast to the co-moving coordinate system associated with a fit) which solely permits to identify individually, and measure quantitatively, the static TPC track distortions arising from (i) the inhomogeneity of the solenoidal magnetic field, (ii) the inhomogeneity of the electric field from the high-voltage mismatch between the inner and <b>outer</b> TPC field <b>cages,</b> (iii) the anode-wire durchgriff, and (iv) a homogenous ion-charge density in the drift volume.
