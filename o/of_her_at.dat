5|$|Madeleine {{was born}} in Leicester and lived with her family in Rothley, also in Leicestershire. At the request of her parents, she was made a ward of court in England shortly after the disappearance, which gave the court {{statutory}} powers to act on her behalf. Police described Madeleine as blonde haired, with blue-green eyes, a small brown spot on her left calf, and a distinctive dark strip on the iris of her right eye. In 2009 the McCanns released age-progressed images of how she may have looked at age six, and in 2012 Scotland Yard commissioned one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>at</b> age nine.|$|E
5|$|The Moreno {{family was}} poor, but {{could afford a}} house and some slaves. Ana María Valle y Ramos, Mariano's mother, {{was one of the}} few literate women in Buenos Aires. Mariano Moreno was the firstborn of {{fourteen}} children. Mariano moved to Chuquisaca with his brother Manuel Moreno and their friend Tomás Guido once the family raised the money. The long and difficult journey gave Mariano a rheumatism attack; he had to stay in bed for fifteen days on arrival. He had further attacks years later. Moreno met María Guadalupe Cuenca in this city, after seeing a miniature portrait <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>at</b> a silversmith's house. Both Moreno and María were expected by their families to follow religious studies, and Moreno's father did not authorize a change. Moreno studied laws all the same, and married María in secret to avoid family resistance. They had a single son, named Mariano like the father.|$|E

Benbow intended to wait for Defiance to come up; but Falmouth opened the engagement by attacking the frigate, and Windsor a ship abreast <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> <b>at</b> four o'clock. Breda joined in, but Defiance and Windsor broke off after a few broadsides and left the Breda under fire from the French, the battle continuing until nightfall.

Monroe's position as a leading sex symbol was confirmed in December 1953, when Hugh Hefner featured her on the cover and as centerfold in {{the first issue of}} Playboy. The cover image was a photograph taken <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>at</b> the Miss America Pageant parade in 1952, and the centerfold featured one of her 1949 nude photographs.|$|E
500|$|After her death, she {{was largely}} {{forgotten}} {{for almost a}} century but today is celebrated {{as a woman who}} successfully combated racial prejudice. Her autobiography, Wonderful Adventures of Mrs. Seacole in Many Lands (1857), is one of the earliest autobiographies of a mixed-race woman, although some aspects of its accuracy have been questioned, with it being claimed that Seacole's achievements have been exaggerated for political reasons. The erection of a statue <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>at</b> St Thomas' Hospital, London on 30 June 2016, describing her as a [...] "pioneer nurse", has generated controversy. Earlier controversy broke out in the United Kingdom late in 2012 over reports of a proposal to remove her from the UK's National Curriculum.|$|E
500|$|In 1979, Streep began workshopping Alice in Concert, {{a musical}} version of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, with writer and {{composer}} Elizabeth Swados and director Joseph Papp; {{the show was}} put on at New York's Public Theater from December 1980. Frank Rich of The New York Times referred to Streep as the [...] "one wonder" [...] of the production, but questioned why she had devoted so much energy to it. By 1980, Streep had progressed to leading roles in films. She was featured {{on the cover of}} Newsweek magazine with the headline [...] "A Star for the 80s", with Jack Kroll commenting, [...] "There's a sense of mystery in her acting; she doesn't simply imitate (although she's a great mimic in private). She transmits a sense of danger, a primal unease lying just below the surface of normal behavior". Streep denounced the fervent media coverage <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>at</b> this time as [...] "excessive hype".|$|E

500|$|Secretary Sherman had {{resigned}} {{on the eve}} of war, and been replaced by his first assistant, William R. Day. [...] One of McKinley's Canton cronies, with little experience of statecraft, Day was never intended as more than a temporary wartime replacement. [...] With America about to splash her flag across the Pacific, McKinley needed a secretary with stronger credentials. On August 14, 1898, Hay received a telegram from McKinley that Day would head the American delegation to the peace talks with Spain, and that Hay would be the new Secretary of State. After some indecision, Hay, who did not think he could decline and still remain as ambassador, accepted. [...] British response to Hay's promotion was generally positive, and Queen Victoria, after he took formal leave <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>at</b> Osborne House, invited him again the following day, and subsequently pronounced him, [...] "the most interesting of all the Ambassadors I have known." ...|$|E
500|$|B.J. awakens from a {{nightmare}} covered in blood, finding the word [...] "Sister" [...] slashed into her chest. She also sees a young Cokely {{reflected in the}} mirror behind her. She heads to a stranger's basement and tears away the floorboards, revealing a skeleton that {{is found to be}} the remains of Agent Ledbetter. Cokely is arrested, but denies attacking B.J., insisting he's too old to even leave his residence without his large oxygen flask. Scully tells Mulder that blood on the latest victim matches Cokely's. The agents visit Thibedeaux, who describes her encounter with Cokely in the 1940s. Mulder notices a photo <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>at</b> the 1939 World's Fair featuring the Trylon and Perisphere. When pressed, she reveals that the rape resulted in a child, which she put up for adoption. The FBI tracks down the child, who turns out to have been B.J.'s father, causing Mulder to surmise that B.J. is the killer and may be operating on genetic memories which tend to skip a generation.|$|E
500|$|Cooper {{comments}} {{of this period}} of David's life, [...] "Pictures <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>at</b> the time show a quintessential librarian, dressed in a dark cardigan over a white shirt with a prim little collar buttoned up to the neck: but at night, dressed in exotic spangled caftans, she was a different creature: drinking at Hedjaki's bar, eating at the P'tit Coin de France, dancing {{on the roof of}} the Continental and then going on to Madame Badia's nightclub or the glamorous Auberge des Pyramides." [...] In her years in Cairo, David had a number of affairs. She enjoyed them for what they were, but only once fell in love. That was with a young officer, Peter Laing, but the relationship came to an end when he was seriously wounded and he returned to his native Canada. Several other of her young men fell in love with her; one of them was Lieutenant-Colonel Anthony David (1911–1967). By now aged thirty, she weighed the advantages and disadvantages of remaining unmarried until such time as the ideal husband might appear, and with considerable misgivings she finally accepted Tony David's proposal of marriage.|$|E

Three days later, she made an appearance on the Fuji TV show Hey! Hey! Hey! Music Champ. Subsequently, she performed the track again on music shows Utaban, Music Fighter and CDTV between December 8–10; the latter performance was a repeat <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>at</b> Utaban but showcased different camera angles. To celebrate the 2005 Christmas season, Utada hosted a live special where she sung a piano-driven version of the track in a studio. [...] "Passion" [...] was performed on Utada's United 2006 concert tour as the opening track, and furthermore on her her the singer had combined both [...] "Passion" [...] and [...] "Sanctuary", performing both Japanese and English throughout the performance.

500|$|The truth finally emerges that Manju {{was merely}} baiting Thyagu {{to teach him}} a lesson.

However, this revelation comes too late for her, as Arun, who is disillusioned with her behaviour, has already married a small town girl (Saritha). When Manju tells her aunt about the attempt to humiliate Thyagu and its ramifications, her aunt tells Manju that she deserved it for leaving behind a golden opportunity {{to start a new}} life. In a final discussion in Thyagu's car, Manju asks Arun's wife, [...] "What do you think of women's liberation?". Arun's wife replies, [...] "I don't know". Manju replies with a cynical, [...] "that is why you are happy". The film ends with Manju standing on the road as the car carrying Thyagu and the married couple pulls away from her. A voice-over says, [...] "She died today. She will be reborn tomorrow. She will die again. She will be reborn again. That is how she is".|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} a {{dictionary}} definition of the word [...] "diva", before cutting to a parking lot outside of a warehouse. Beyoncé, {{wearing a pair of}} [...] "dangle shades", walks past a car full of mannequin parts into the warehouse. From here, she is accompanied by her two dancers and a variety of high fashion outfits. When she states [...] "Diva's gettin' money..." [...] she waves a fan made of $100 bills. During the bridge to the climax, Beyoncé dances on a single light and then during the climax, she is seen very glossy in another wardrobe choice dancing in robotic movements to the beat with gold punctuating the black and white scene. In one scene, Beyoncé is seen dancing robotically in front of a set of gold-tinted mannequins; while in another, she dances against a wall with two large chains hanging from the ceiling. During the last chorus, Beyoncé is in her last wardrobe change in front of window which is where the paparazzi had taken photos <b>of</b> <b>her.</b> <b>At</b> the end of the song, Beyoncé walks back out to the parking lot. She lights up a cigar and throws the lighter into the car, letting it explode. As she walks away, the intro to [...] "Video Phone" [...] (a track from I Am... Sasha Fierce) plays.

500|$|Three months later, Meg {{returns home}} with the mind and {{attitude}} of a hardened criminal, complete with a new thuggish and rebellious look. She immediately begins abusing her family, retaliating to the many years of abuse she had endured under them, such as curb-stomping Peter, raping him in the shower with a loofah, and using her mother's shirts as toilet paper (while also keeping a [...] "poop bucket" [...] next to her bed and refusing to empty it until it gets full). In addition, she continues habits she picked up in prison, and beats up the kids who make fun <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>at</b> school (specifically Connie D'Amico and her friends {{with a bag of}} full soda cans which she hits them with, cracking three of the popular kids' skulls open and tongue-kissing Connie afterwards) for which she is suspended. Wanting {{to start a new life}} away from home, Meg ambushes Brian in his car and threatens him with a gun to drive to Mort's Pharmacy so she can rob him. Brian, however, shows her the article he wrote, in which he describes her [...] "far sweeter and kinder" [...] than the typical American girl. Touched by the fact that Brian actually cares for her just as she was, Meg changes her mind and returns home with Brian; having changed back her normal personality in the process. Back at home, she makes a bad joke involving Wesley Snipes, and Peter, presumably not amused at this, ends the episode by saying [...] "Always end on a strong joke".|$|E
500|$|In Freaks, {{director}} Tod Browning of Dracula fame helms {{a picture}} that depicts a traveling circus populated {{by a group of}} deformed carnival freaks. Browning populated the movie with actual carnival sideshow performers including [...] "midgets, dwarfs, hermaphrodites, Siamese twins, and, most awful, the armless and legless man billed as the 'living torso'". There is also a group of Pinheads, who are depicted as fortunate in that they are not mentally capable enough to understand that they disgust people. But the truly unsavory characters here are the villains, the circus strongman Hercules and the beautiful high-wire artist Cleopatra, who intends to marry and poison Hans, the midget heir who is enamored <b>of</b> <b>her.</b> <b>At</b> a dinner celebrating their union, one of the freaks dances on the table as they chant [...] "gooble-gobble, gobble, gobble, one of us, one of us, we accept her, we accept her." [...] Disgusted, Cleopatra insults Hans and makes out with Hercules in front of him. When the freaks discover her plot, they exact revenge by mutilating Cleopatra into a freak. Although, circus freaks were common in the early 1930s, the film was their first depiction on screen. Browning took care to linger over shots of the deformed, disabled performers with long takes of them including one of the [...] "living torso" [...] lighting a match and then a cigarette with his mouth. The film was accompanied by a sensational marketing campaign that asked sexual questions such as [...] "Do the Siamese Twins make love?", [...] "What sex is the half-man half-woman?", and [...] "Can a full grown woman truly love a midget?" [...] Surprisingly, given its reaction to Frankenstein, the state of Kansas objected to nothing in Freaks. However, other states, such as Georgia, were repulsed by the film and it was not shown in many locales. The film later became a cult classic spurred by midnight movie showings, but it was a box-office bomb in its original release.|$|E
