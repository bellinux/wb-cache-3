5|$|Various authors regard Suillus collinitus as edible with a sour odor and nondescript taste. It is advisable, as for {{all species}} of Suillus, to pick only young {{specimens}} and to peel the cuticle before preparation. The mushroom contains several tocopherols, {{a class of}} chemical compounds collectively known as vitamin E, and which confer antioxidant activity. They also contain several <b>organic</b> <b>acids,</b> most predominantly the pairs malic and quinic acids, and citric and ketoglutaric acid, which respectively make up 42% and 30% of total <b>organic</b> <b>acids.</b> The composition and concentration of <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> in mushrooms are major factors in influencing their flavour; some <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> contribute to antioxidant activity.|$|E

5|$|Certain {{bacteria}} form close spatial {{associations that}} are essential for their survival. One such mutualistic association, called interspecies hydrogen transfer, occurs between clusters of anaerobic bacteria that consume <b>organic</b> <b>acids,</b> such as butyric acid or propionic acid, and produce hydrogen, and methanogenic Archaea that consume hydrogen. The bacteria in this association are unable to consume the <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> as this reaction produces hydrogen that accumulates in their surroundings. Only the intimate association with the hydrogen-consuming Archaea keeps the hydrogen concentration low enough to allow the bacteria to grow.|$|E

Birds were maintained in battery brooders confined in an environmentally controlled experimental room. There were 4 dietary treatments, each consisting of 6 replicates. Dietary treatments were: (i) basal diet (as a control), (ii) basal diet + MOS 2 kg/ton feed, (iii) basal diet + <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> mixture 3 kg/ton feed and (iv) basal diet + MOS 2 kg/ton feed + <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> mixture 3 kg/ton feed. Weight gain of the broilers in this study was significantly influenced by the addition of <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> mixture (P< 0. 01).

A group of sixty 1 -year old male lambs of Kivircik Breed were used. The animals were divided in to 4 groups of 15 lambs each. The groups were assigned as control, <b>organic</b> <b>acid,</b> direct-feed microbial, and direct-feed microbial plus <b>organic</b> <b>acid.</b> A commercial direct-feed microbial product and <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> mix were used as feed treatment supplements.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the effects of blends of dietary protected <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> supplementation on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, blood profiles, faecal microflora, and gas emission on sows and piglets with emphasis on their modes of action to improve pig performance. A total of 12 sows with an average initial body weight (BW) of 252. 40 ± 11. 7 kg were used in this trial. Growth performance, blood profiles, and nutrient digestibility of sows and piglets fed protected <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> were evaluated. The dietary treatments included a basal diet (CON); CON + 0. 1 % protected organic acid; and CON + 0. 2 % protected <b>organic</b> <b>acid.</b> The BW and back fat of sows was checked four days prior to farrowing and at the weaning day to calculate BW loss and back fat loss during that period. Inclusion of 0. 2 % protected <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> provided a greater digestibility than CON diets throughout the experimental period in lactating sows. Dietary supplementation with 0. 2 % protected <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> led to a higher white blood cell and lymphocyte concentration than CON treatment in sucking piglets. Immunoglobulin G concentration observed was greater in protected <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> groups in lactating sow and sucking piglets. Increased faecal Lactobacillus counts with decreased E. coli concentrations were observed with the diets of protected <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> fed to lactating sows. The E. coli counts were decreased in weaning piglets. The faecal H 2 S contents were decreased in 0. 2 % protected <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> diets during farrowing on day 1. Dietary supplementation with protected <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> blends beneficially affects the nutrient digestibility, ileal noxious gas (NH 3 and H 2 S) emission, as well as intestinal microbial balance in lactating sows...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to evaluate the effect of different dietary supplementation levels of zinc oxide and of an <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> blend on broiler performance, carcass traits, and serum parameters. A total of 2400 one-day-old male Ross 308 broiler chicks, with average initial body weight 44. 21 ± 0. 19 g, was distributed according to a completely randomized design in a 2 x 3 factorial arrangement. Six treatments, consisting of diets containing two zinc oxide levels (0 and 0. 01 % of the diet) and three <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> blend levels (0, 0. 15, and 0. 30 %) were applied, with eight replicates of 50 birds each. The experimental diets were supplied ad libitum for 42 days. There were significant performance differences among birds fed the different zinc oxide and <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> blend levels until 42 d of age (p< 0. 01). The result of this experiment showed that the <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> blend did not affect feed intake, but zinc oxide increased feed intake. Carcass traits were not influenced by the experimental supplements. Zinc oxide supplementation increased serum alkaline phosphatase level (p< 0. 01). The <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> blend reduced serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels (p< 0. 05). No interactions were found between zinc oxide and the <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> blend for none of the evaluated parameters.

5|$|Mycena galopus is a {{saprobic}} fungus, {{and plays}} an important role in forest ecosystems as a decomposer of leaf litter. It has been estimated in the UK to account for a large portion of the decomposition of the autumn leaf litter in British woodlands. It is able to break down the lignin and cellulose components of leaf litter. Grown in axenic culture in the laboratory, the fungus mycelium has been shown to degrade (in addition to lignin and cellulose) hemicelluloses, protein, soluble carbohydrates, and purified xylan and pectin using enzymes such as polyphenol oxidases, cellulases, and catalase. It is particularly adept at breaking down lignin, which is the second most abundant renewable organic compound in the biosphere, after cellulose. Research also suggests that the fungus weathers soil minerals, making them more available to mycorrhizal plants. Phosphorus, an important macronutrient influencing plant growth, typically occurs in primary minerals like apatite, or other organic complexes, and its low solubility often results in low phosphorus availability in soil. The biological activity of M.galopus mycelium can increase the availability of phosphorus and other nutrients, both as a result of soil acidification due to cation uptake and via the release of weathering agents such low molecular mass <b>organic</b> <b>acids.</b> Studies have shown that the fungus is sensitive to low concentrations of sulphite (SO32−), a byproduct of sulphur dioxide pollution, suggesting that this pollution can be toxic to the growth of the fungus (and the subsequent decomposition of leaf litter) at environmentally relevant concentrations.|$|E

40|$|Soil {{with more}} than 20 % of organic content is {{classified}} as organic soil in Malaysia. Contents of organic soil consist {{of different types of}} organic and inorganic matter.

Each dietary treatment had 5 replications and each replication comprised two adjacent cages. Corn-soybean meal based rations were used. Five dietary treatments were formed as followed: (1) a basal ration with no supplemental P (negative control, NC) (2750 kcal ME/kg, 17 % CP, 0. 34 % total P, 3. 8 % Ca), (2) basal ration supplemented with dicalcium phosphate (1. 4 %) (positive control, PC), (3) basal ration supplemented with 0. 035 % phytase (ZY Phytase II- 5, NC+P), (4) basal ration supplemented with 1. 0 % <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> (Salstop SD, NC+OA) and (5) basal ration supplemented with both 0. 035 % phytase and 1. 0 % <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> (NC+POA).
