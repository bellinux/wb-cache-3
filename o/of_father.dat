The church was saved from destruction that might be brought by American soldiers in exchange for food and water in 1901. During the Second World War, the church suffered damages but was later restored. From being part of Baclayon, Balilihan, Alburquerque, Corella and Sikatuna became independent parishes in 1829, 1869, 1884 and 1914 respectively.

5|$|Tamagnino {{is known}} to have left Brescia while the {{construction}} of the sanctuary was ongoing, evidently finding his work undervalued and underpaid. The reasons for the bias are unclear, but it is possible that Cairano enjoyed local favour, especially from the directors of the company commissioning the shrine, which allowed him to prevail over Tamagnino despite the latter's technical superiority. Tamagnino then won the prestigious contract for the façade of the Certosa of Pavia, to be installed under the aegis <b>of</b> <b>Father</b> Amedeo and Antonio Mantegazza. The corporate pact between the artist and the two sculptors strengthened in May 1492, providing Tamagnino with a unique training experience as well as a remarkable leap in his career.|$|E

5|$|The French Spaniel (Epagneul Français) is a {{breed of}} dog of the Spaniel-like setter. It was {{developed}} in France and Canada as a hunting dog, descended from dogs of the 14th century. Popular with royalty during the Middle Ages, it nearly became extinct {{by the turn of}} the 20th century but was saved by the efforts <b>of</b> <b>Father</b> Fournier, a French priest. One of the largest breeds of Spaniel, it typically has a white coat with brown markings. It is a friendly breed that has few health issues, but can be affected by a syndrome called acral mutilation and analgesia. The breed is recognised by Canadian and international kennel clubs but not by The Kennel Club (UK). The American Kennel Club has included the breed in its Foundation Stock Service, the first step to full recognition.|$|E

5|$|The mission {{grew from}} {{strength}} to strength and by 1907 the congregation numbered 150, with school attendance at 60. In time plans {{were made for}} a larger, more permanent church. This was the brainchild <b>of</b> <b>Father</b> Thomas Moloney, who bought the current presbytery and acquired the land that stood at the back so that a church could be built. The foundation stone was eventually laid on Low Sunday 1931 by Archbishop Alban Goodier, an English Jesuit who had been Archbishop of Bombay between 1919 and 1926. The new church, in Oxford Road, was designed by the diocesan architect, T. H. B. Scott. It was built of brick in the Romanesque style, seating 350. The church was built quickly and opened by Cardinal Bourne on 29 September 1931. It was officially consecrated on 14 May 1936, after its debts were cleared.|$|E

In 1840, Father Joaquin de Coria repaired the church, but because of a fire in 1851 which ravaged most of the town, Father Juan de Llanera fixed the damages to the church the following year. Father Juan de Dios de Villayos rebuilt the church roof and bell tower after it was damaged by an earthquake in 1881, and the church was rebuilt again in 1883 by Father Paulino Camba. Damaged by the earthquake of 1937, it was repaired again by Father Federico Diaz Pines with the help of the Confederation of United Catholics (Kapisanang Unidad Catolica). During World War II, the church suffered damage and was later renovated. A major repair was done from 1980 to 1984, when a story of the bell tower was rebuilt and the ceiling was renovated under the Parish Council of the Laity.|$|E
