5|$|Although the High Court {{ordered that}} {{the verdict of}} the {{original}} conviction be overturned and that a retrial be conducted, {{there was never any}} retrial since Dietrich had already served his sentence.

5|$|Matthew Grant Webster, an 18-year-old {{who acted}} as a bouncer at the event, pleaded guilty to her murder {{and was sentenced to}} 20 years in prison with a 14-year non-parole period. He was {{released}} <b>on</b> <b>parole</b> in June 2004, after serving 14½ years. Guy Charles Wilson, the other bouncer and only other person aged over 18 at the party, pleaded guilty to assault; a third male (aged 15) pleaded guilty to having sex with a minor. The investigation of Leigh's murder proved controversial, however, as several people who admitted to various crimes, including assaulting Leigh, were never charged; nor was anyone ever charged with her sexual assault. Webster's confession did not match the forensic evidence. The murder investigation was reviewed by the New South Wales Crime Commission in 1996, and by the Police Integrity Commission in 1998, with the latter recommending the dismissal of the detective in charge of the investigation.|$|E
5|$|On 1 August 1798, the British fleet under Horatio Nelson {{captured}} {{or destroyed}} {{all but two}} French vessels in the Battle of the Nile, defeating Bonaparte's goal to strengthen the French position in the Mediterranean. His army had succeeded in a temporary increase of French power in Egypt, though it faced repeated uprisings. In early 1799, he moved an army into the Ottoman province of Damascus (Syria and Galilee). Bonaparte led these 13,000 French soldiers in the conquest of the coastal towns of Arish, Gaza, Jaffa, and Haifa. The attack on Jaffa was particularly brutal. Bonaparte discovered {{that many of the}} defenders were former prisoners of war, ostensibly <b>on</b> <b>parole,</b> so he ordered the garrison and 1,400 prisoners to be executed by bayonet or drowning to save bullets. Men, women, and children were robbed and murdered for three days.|$|E
50|$|On May 14, 1994, Chen Ziming was {{released}} <b>on</b> medical <b>parole.</b> In June 1995, {{he was placed}} under house arrest and then later returned to prison.|$|R
50|$|After 10 years elapsed, {{his first}} and second parole {{hearings}} in a Prison Court were unsuccessful. After he served one more year in jail, the Prison Court released him <b>on</b> strictly supervised <b>parole</b> <b>on</b> January 31, 2000, <b>on</b> his third <b>parole</b> hearing. However, he was immediately involuntary committed to the Niuvanniemi mental hospital in Kuopio for criminal-psychiatric reasons. The involuntary commitment was reaffirmed in 2007 by the administrative court of Kuopio, {{on the basis that}} if he was released, he would be a serious security risk.|$|R
50|$|On December 23, 2008 the National Parole Board {{authorized}} Guité's {{conditional release}} making him eligible for day <b>parole</b> <b>on</b> February 15, 2009 and full <b>parole</b> <b>on</b> September 16, 2009. Under Canadian law, first time non-violent offenders are allowed an accelerated review {{and a possible}} early release.|$|R
5|$|The {{premise of}} a repentant murderer seeking {{to atone for}} their actions {{appears to have been}} based on the real-life case of Albert Fish, who practised severe self-harm after killing twelve-year-old Grace Budd. Fish would insert needles into his {{perineum}} and force rose stems along his urethra to be forcibly pulled out. However, the actual murders may have been inspired by the case of Susan Smith, a mother of two who drowned her children by sinking her car in a lake. Mention is also made in the episode of Arthur Shawcross, whose recidivism is cited by Garry's prosecutors as an example of why murder should warrant a death penalty. Shawcross was released from prison after serving a sentence for killing two children, only to kill eleven women while <b>on</b> <b>parole.</b>|$|E
5|$|Washington's {{military}} experience {{began in the}} French and Indian War with a commission as a major in the militia of the British Province of Virginia. In 1753 Washington was sent as an ambassador from the British crown to the French officials and Indians {{as far north as}} present-day Erie, Pennsylvania. The following year he led another expedition to the area to assist in the construction of a fort at present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Before reaching that point, he and some of his men, accompanied by Indian allies, ambushed a French scouting party. Its leader was killed, although the exact circumstances of his death were disputed. This peacetime act of aggression is seen {{as one of the first}} military steps leading to the global Seven Years' War. The French responded by attacking fortifications Washington erected following the ambush, forcing his surrender. Released <b>on</b> <b>parole,</b> Washington and his troops returned to Virginia.|$|E
5|$|While Allen's {{service as}} a judge in Vermont was brief, he {{continued}} to ferret out Tories and report them to local Boards of Confiscation for action. He was so zealous in these efforts that they also included naming his own brother Levi, who was apparently trying to swindle Allen and Ira out of land at the time. This action was somewhat surprising, as Levi had not only attempted to purchase Allen's release {{while he was in}} Halifax, but he had also traveled to New York while Allen was <b>on</b> <b>parole</b> there, and furnished him with goods and money. Allen and Levi engaged in a war of words, many of which were printed in the Connecticut Courant, even after Levi crossed British lines. They would eventually reconcile in 1783.|$|E
50|$|On September 17, 1990, the District Court imposed {{sentences}} of mandatory life without <b>parole</b> <b>on</b> Count One, life without <b>parole</b> <b>on</b> Counts Two and Five, 60 months on Count Eleven, and 48 months on Counts Fourteen, Fifteen, Sixteen, and Eighteen. Edmond's sentences were to run concurrently.|$|R
50|$|Reid was {{released}} <b>on</b> full <b>parole</b> in June 1987. He lived with Musgrave {{and her daughters}} in Sidney, British Columbia, teaching creative writing at Camosun College and working as a youth counsellor in the Northwest Territories. Reid also struggled with heroin and cocaine addiction, and in June 1999, he committed another bank robbery {{and was sentenced to}} 18 years in prison. He received day <b>parole</b> <b>on</b> January 28, 2008.|$|R
50|$|He served <b>on</b> the <b>Parole</b> Board for Scotland from 1994 to 1997. Kirkwood {{was one of}} five judges {{selected}} to hear the appeal of convicted Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset al-Megrahi.|$|R
5|$|While Edward was away, Salisbury was {{captured}} by the French at Lille in April 1340, and imprisoned in Paris. Reportedly, King Philip VI of France wanted to execute Salisbury and Robert Ufford, Earl of Suffolk, who {{was captured}} with him. Philip was, however, dissuaded by John of Bohemia, who argued that the earls could come in handy in an exchange, should any French noblemen be captured. Though released <b>on</b> <b>parole</b> in September, {{it was not until}} May 1342 that he reached a final settlement with the French. Salisbury was freed in a prisoner exchange, but only on the condition that he never fight in France again.|$|E
5|$|Dunn's second World Grand Champion was RPM, {{a son of}} Dark Spirit's Rebel. Dunn showed RPM to a Three-Year-Old World Championship in 1997. In 1998, RPM and Dunn won the Four-Year-Old World Championship {{and then}} placed second in the World Grand Championship; the latter {{achievement}} made them the Reserve World Grand Champions. Dunn had hopes of winning first the next year. In May 1999 the horse was sold to L R & N Partners, LLC for $1.25 million. The new owners moved RPM to trainer Sammy Day's stable in Shelbyville, {{with the intention of}} entering him in the Celebration. Shortly before the Celebration, Day was convicted of bribing a judge, fined, and put on a five-year suspension. Dunn was given the task of riding RPM in the show, and won the World Grand Championship. Dunn was 81, again making him the oldest rider ever to win the class, breaking his earlier record. At the same show, Steve Dunn rode Out <b>on</b> <b>Parole</b> to a Two-Year-Old World Championship, and another Dunn-trained horse, Broken Promises, won the Four-Year-Old World Championship.|$|E
5|$|In April 2001, {{while he}} was <b>on</b> <b>parole,</b> a Los Angeles police officer found him {{wandering}} barefoot in Culver City, just outside Los Angeles. He was arrested for suspicion of being {{under the influence of}} drugs, but was released a few hours later, even though tests showed he had cocaine in his system. After this last arrest, producer David E. Kelley and other Ally McBeal executives ordered last-minute rewrites and reshoots and dismissed Downey from the show, despite the fact that Downey's character had resuscitated Ally McBeals ratings. The Culver City arrest also cost him a role in the high-profile film America's Sweethearts, and the subsequent incarceration forced Mel Gibson to shut down his planned stage production of Hamlet, as well. In July 2001, Downey pleaded no contest to the Palm Springs charges, avoiding jail time. Instead, he was sent into drug rehabilitation and put on a three-year probation, benefiting from the California Proposition 36, which had been passed the year before with the aim of helping nonviolent drug offenders overcome their addictions instead of sending them to jail.|$|E
50|$|Takna Jigme Sangpo (born 1926) is the longest-serving {{political}} prisoner of Tibetan ethnicity, having spent 37 {{years in a}} prison near Lhasa.

5|$|Meanwhile, the American Revolutionary War continued. Boone joined General George Rogers Clark's {{invasion}} of the Ohio country in 1780, fighting in the Battle of Piqua on August 7. In October, when Boone was hunting with his brother Ned, Shawnees shot and killed Ned. Apparently thinking that they had killed Daniel Boone, the Shawnees beheaded Ned and took the head home as a trophy. In 1781, Boone traveled to Richmond to take his seat in the legislature, but British dragoons under Banastre Tarleton captured Boone and several other legislators near Charlottesville. The British released Boone <b>on</b> <b>parole</b> several days later. During Boone's term, Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown in October 1781, but the fighting continued in Kentucky unabated. Boone returned to Kentucky and in August 1782 fought in the Battle of Blue Licks, in which his son Israel was killed. In November 1782, Boone took part in another Clark expedition into Ohio, the last major campaign of the war.|$|E
5|$|On 1 June 1945, Gollob, who {{had been}} {{released}} <b>on</b> <b>parole,</b> was arrested by the Austrian Gendarmerie acting for the US authorities. From Kitzbühel, he was taken via Pass Strub, and other internment camps, to Ludwigsburg in Württemberg, and then flown to England. In England, he was held at Latimer and interrogated at the Combined Services Detailed Interrogation Centre regarding combat operations. He was released by US forces in 1946 and was then interned by the French authorities, as his home region of North Tyrol had {{become part of the}} French Occupation Zone. After release, Gollob made a living by contributing to aircraft magazines and lecturing. In 1948, he became General Secretary of the Federation of Independents, a right-wing political party in Austria. In 1950, the party expelled Gollob following the internal strife between the more liberal approach of the founders Herbert Kraus and Viktor Reimann and the German nationalist faction centered on Gollob.|$|E
5|$|On July 22, 1986, {{both women}} entered Alford pleas for the Salmonella attack {{and the other}} charges, and {{received}} sentences ranging from three to twenty years, to be served concurrently. Sheela received 20 years for the attempted murder of Rajneesh's physician, twenty years for first-degree assault in the poisoning of Judge Hulse, ten years for second-degree assault in the poisoning of Commissioner Matthews, {{four and a half}} years for her role in the attack, {{four and a half years}} for the wiretapping conspiracy, and five years' probation for immigration fraud; Puja received fifteen, fifteen, seven and a half, and four and a half years, respectively, for her role in the first four of these crimes, as well as three years' probation for the wiretapping conspiracy. Both Sheela and Puja were released <b>on</b> <b>parole</b> early for good behavior, after serving twenty-nine months of their sentences in a minimum-security federal prison. Sheela's Green Card was revoked; she moved to Switzerland. She remarried there and went on to run two nursing homes in Switzerland.|$|E
50|$|In July 2007 Caligiuri {{demanded a}} {{moratorium}} <b>on</b> further <b>paroles</b> in Connecticut following the home invasion murders of the Petit family by two paroled convicts. Investigation by the Hartford Courant revealed irregularities in the Connecticut parole process. In September 2007, Governor M. Jodi Rell announced a moratorium <b>on</b> the <b>parole</b> of violent offenders. On January 22, 2008 {{a special session}} was held which passed laws declaring home invasion a Class A felony and reforming the parole board. Caligiuri was the prime sponsor of a proposed Three Strikes Law in Connecticut, which was not adopted in the special session.|$|R

Later, the owners of both horses {{explained}} away their losses. Ten Broeck had been seen for some time before the race {{to have had a}} cough. As for Tom Ochiltree, before the race Wyndham Walden had telegraphed George Lorillard to warn him Tom Ochiltree had a cough. Lorillard had instructed him to run Tom Ochiltree [...] "…so as not to spoil the race." [...] But he also put $500 <b>on</b> <b>Parole's</b> nose.|$|R
