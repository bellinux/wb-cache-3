5|$|After {{crossing}} the Passaic River into Bergen County, {{the road is}} called Paterson Avenue and designated as County Route 120, in Wallington, in a residential and light-density commercial area. The road becomes the border between Wallington {{to the north and}} East Rutherford to the south. At the end of Wallington, Paterson Avenue is the border between Carlstadt and East Rutherford for a short distance but then the road dips into East Rutherford to avoid a hill (the bypass, which goes <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill,</b> is called Hoboken Road). The road returns to the Carlstadt/East Rutherford border at Route 17 which it crosses over via an overpass, and is then designated as Route 120 and Paterson Plank Road for a distance.|$|E
5|$|In A Game of Thrones (1996), Tyrion {{visits the}} Stark stronghold of Winterfell with King Robert Baratheon's entourage. While there, Tyrion tries to befriend Ned Stark's bastard son Jon Snow, and {{provides}} Ned's recently crippled son Bran with a saddle design {{to help him}} ride a horse. On the road home, Tyrion is taken prisoner by Ned's wife Catelyn, who believes he ordered the attempted murder of Bran. Taken to Catelyn's sister Lysa Arryn at the Eyrie, Tyrion demands a trial by combat and is championed by the mercenary Bronn, who wins his freedom. Using his wit {{and the promise of}} a reward, Tyrion wins <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> tribes of the Vale while {{on his way to the}} Lannister army camp. Finally impressed with Tyrion's political instincts, his father Tywin appoints Tyrion acting Hand of the King in an attempt to control Joffrey. While at the camp, Tyrion beds a prostitute named Shae and takes her with him to the capital.|$|E

25|$|Thus, {{with the}} {{exception}} of Blisworth Tunnel, the main line was fully open in 1800. To allow goods to cross the gap, a road was built in 1800 over the top of Blisworth hill and, later, upon the recommendation of committee member Joseph Wilkes, Benjamin Outram was contracted to build a tramway <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill.</b>|$|E

25|$|Many hilltops in Portugal {{and other}} parts of Europe have been sites of {{religious}} devotion since antiquity, and {{it is possible that the}} Bom Jesus hill was one of these. However, the first indication of a chapel <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> dates from 1373. This chapel - dedicated to the Holy Cross - was rebuilt in the 15th and 16th centuries. In 1629 a pilgrimage church was built dedicated to the Bom Jesus (Good Jesus), with six chapels dedicated to the Passion of Christ.|$|E

During the next year, Bruce only resurfaced to play on Charlie Mariano's Helen 12 Trees album.|$|E
25|$|To {{construct}} the canal, {{the line of}} the tunnel was ranged <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> and then fifteen vertical shafts were sunk into the ground. It was from these that heads were driven on the canal line. A major problem was the change in the rock type which ranged from soft earth to Millstone Grit. The construction site was also subject to flooding regularly, a problem which was overcome by the construction of steam engines to operate the pumps. Stoves were installed at the bottom of upcast pipes to overcome the problem of ventilation.|$|E

25|$|The Bergen Hill Cut, {{the last}} part of the Jersey City–New Brunswick line to be finished, opened January 22, 1838, {{replacing}} the old temporary alignment <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> and ending the use of horse power. On March 15, 1837 a supplement to the C's charter was passed, allowing the branch to New Brunswick connecting with the New Jersey Rail Road to branch off of the C at Bordentown rather than Spotswood, to pass through Trenton for a connection with the Trenton Delaware Bridge and the Philadelphia & Trenton Railroad. Portions could be built next to the Delaware and Raritan Canal or along the New Brunswick and Trenton Turnpike.|$|E
25|$|On 20 July 2006, {{when the}} train was {{entering}} the tunnel section of its course, two carriages uncoupled, the carriages comprising the front half continuing up the slope while the rear half of the train remained stuck in the tunnel.

Six people were taken to hospital and 23 others were treated for cuts and bruises. Following the incident the Runaway Mine Train was closed {{for the rest of}} the season. The train was only returned to full length operation in June the following year.|$|E

25|$|The Simeon {{family with}} five children, a housekeeper, a governess, a lady's maid, a housemaide, a nurse, a cook and a footman left England from the East India Docks on 18 June 1851 {{on the ship}} Canterbury and arrived on 21 October in Lyttelton. Lyttelton {{inhabitants}} were amazed {{about the size of}} the party. The children and servants were put up at the Mitre in Lyttelton at a cost of £4 10s per day until he had found a town house to rent on the Bridle Path. He bought town section 102 in Lyttelton's Coleridge Street (today Coleridge Terrace), not far from the rented house, and built a substantial house with eight rooms near where the Bridle Path goes <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> to Christchurch. This latter house is still standing and is registered as a Category II historic place by Heritage New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|Before the Confederates could {{approach}} Dagwell and his men, Major Remington {{appeared with}} the rest of the detachment. When informed of the situation, Remington did not try to flee but ordered his men in line at the crest of the hill where Dagwell had viewed the 2,000-man Confederate force. Meanwhile, Stuart had heard about the encounter with his staff officers and ordered Brigadier General Wade Hampton III to bring up the lead regiment quickly to meet the threat. The advance unit of the Confederates, the 1st North Carolina Cavalry, then came <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> and moved to within 30 yards of the Union line but did not move further forward despite orders which Dagwell could hear. When the Union troops did not surrender after about 15 seconds, the opposing forces began to shoot at each other.|$|E
25|$|On December 21, 1866, Crazy Horse and {{six other}} warriors, both Lakota and Cheyenne, decoyed Capt. William Fetterman's 53 {{infantry}}men and 27 cavalry troopers under Lt. Grummond into an ambush. They had been sent out from Fort Phil Kearny {{to follow up on}} an earlier attack on a wood train. Crazy Horse lured Fetterman's infantry up a hill. Grummond's cavalry followed the other six decoys along Peno Head Ridge and down toward Peno Creek, where several Cheyenne women taunted the soldiers. Meanwhile, Cheyenne leader Little Wolf and his warriors, who had been hiding {{on the opposite side of}} Peno Head Ridge, blocked the return route to the fort. The Lakota warriors swept <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> and attacked the infantry. Additional Cheyenne and Lakota hiding in the buckbrush along Peno Creek effectively surrounded the soldiers. Seeing that they were surrounded, Grummond headed his cavalry back to Fetterman.|$|E

25|$|While in Egypt, the {{division}} {{was assigned to}} the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps along with the New Zealand and Australian Division. Following the Allied decision to force a passage through the Dardanelles, {{the division}} was allocated {{to take part in a}} landing on the Gallipoli peninsula along with Anglo-French forces. The 1st Division made the initial landing at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915. The 3rd Brigade formed the covering force which landed first, around dawn. The 1st and 2nd Brigades followed, landing from transports, and all were ashore by 9:00am. While the landing was lightly opposed on the beach by elements of a single Turkish battalion, the Australians were checked short of their objectives as Turkish reinforcements arrived to secure the high ground around Chunuk Bair and Sari Bair. Critical fights developed on the left, <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> known as Baby 700, and on the right on 400 Plateau, but stalemate set in and little further progress would be made for the remaining eight months of the campaign.|$|E
25|$|Crossing into Broome County, NY 17C {{abruptly}} {{climbs up}} the side of Bornt Hill and parallels the tracks and river into the town of Union, entering the urban core of the Binghamton metropolitan area. The route, still bearing the name of Campville Road, runs <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> to the north and west of Tri-Cities Airport and the Triple Cities to the east become visible for the first time. After passing Glendale Technology Park, a former IBM complex, NY 17C crosses over to {{the south side of the}} railroad and passes the En-Joie Golf Course, one of the many remnants of the area's prosperity under Endicott-Johnson. As it takes on the name West Main Street and crosses South Grippen Avenue, NY 17C becomes a residential street, passing numerous single-family homes for a short distance as it crosses the border into Endicott. The route becomes a commercial village street before intersecting with NY 26, Nanticoke Avenue, at the center of downtown Union. Now concurrent, NY 17C and NY 26 pick up an additional lane on each side as they proceed east as East Main Street through Endicott. The next major intersection is with Vestal Avenue, where NY 26 formerly left NY 17C, turning south and crossing the Susquehanna River to enter Vestal on Bridge Street, now CR 48. After Vestal Avenue, NY 17C and NY 26 pass under the Endicott Square Deal Arch.|$|E
