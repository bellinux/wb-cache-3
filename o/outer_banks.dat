40|$|In {{this paper}} the flow around a streambank-attached in-stream {{structure}} - rock vane - {{installed in a}} meandering channel is investigated via large-eddy simulation (LES). LES is carried out for the case where the rock vane is installed along the <b>outer</b> <b>bank</b> of a field-scale, natural-like experimental meandering channel facility. Analysis of the simulated flow field shows that the rock vane acts to displace the upstream high-velocity core toward the channel centre and it effectively reduces the bed shear stress along the outer streambank. It is {{also found that the}} presence of the rock vane gives rise to the growth of the secondary flow cell formed along the outer streambank, which is often called the <b>outer</b> <b>bank</b> cell. Numerical results suggest that the growth of the <b>outer</b> <b>bank</b> cell and the subsequent displacement of the <b>outer</b> <b>bank</b> shear layer are responsible for the displacement of channel thalweg toward the channel centre.

40|$|Abstract. Natural channel have complex three {{dimensional}} flow structures {{particularly at}} the <b>outer</b> <b>bank</b> due to the combined effects of secondary currents and higher velocity profiles. In this paper Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is used to study the meandering bend of the Barak River. Numerical modeling is done using Reynolds averaged continuity and Navier Stokes equation. These equations are solved by finite volume method. Appropriate representation of counter-rotating secondary flow in the channel bend requires both the suitable treatment of the free water surface and a turbulence model that can resolve the anisotropy of turbulence. Hence the volume of fluid method (VOF) was used to model the free surface and reynolds stress turbulence model (RSM) {{has been used to}} close the RANS equations. Higher velocity profiles were prominent at the <b>outer</b> <b>bank.</b> Skew induced stream wise vorticity was observed close to the <b>outer</b> <b>bank</b> which confirms the existence of corner induced secondary current. The vortices formed were found to be of Prandtl’s first kind...|$|R
40|$|The typical flow {{dynamics}} of meandering streams related to curvature and associated bed topography {{can be altered}} by stream width variations and vegetation. This paper presents laboratory experiments conducted in a reduced-scale model of a low-sinuosity, variable-width bend with and without vegetation on the <b>outer</b> <b>bank.</b> Measurements of velocities and water surface elevations on a dense grid allowed, for the first time, the quantification of fluxes and forces that influence flow structure. Experiments without vegetation showed superelevation of water surface along the <b>outer</b> <b>bank</b> due to centrifugal effects, accompanied by longitudinal variations in water-surface gradients associated with width changes, as the channel was narrower near the bend inflection and wider near the apex. High <b>outer</b> <b>bank</b> velocities developed in the downstream part of the bend due {{to the absence of}} well-developed bed topography. Vegetation reduced centrifugal effects at the bend entrance but enhanced them at the bend exit, affecting flow in the downstream bend...|$|R

40|$|In open-channel bends, {{interactions}} between streamwise flow, curvature-induced secondary flow and sediment transport {{lead to a}} typical bar-pool bed topography. Erosion occurs near the <b>outer</b> <b>bank</b> that can endanger structures, whereas deposition occurs near the inner bank that can reduce the navigable width. Laboratory experiments have been performed in a sharp open-channel bend to investigate how a bubble screen can influence the bend hydrodynamics and morphological evolution. A porous tube placed near the <b>outer</b> <b>bank</b> and connected at both ends to a pressurized-air system generated a bubble screen strong enough to counteract the descending velocities of the curvature-induced secondary flow. Foregoing clear-water scour experiments with and without the bubble screen {{have shown that the}} bubble screen modifies the velocity distribution and acts directly on the bend morphology by shifting the region of maximum scour further away from the <b>outer</b> <b>bank.</b> In the reported study, similar experiments have been performed under live-bed conditions. Measurements of the three-dimensional flow field and topography were compared and allowed estimating the beneficial effect of the bubble screen. In the upstream part of the bend, the redistribution of velocity pattern is not sufficient to strongly modify the morphology whereas at the downstream part of the bend, the scour hole is reduced and shifted from the <b>outer</b> <b>bank</b> {{to the middle of the}} cross-section...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAn {{electromagnetic}} {{current meter}} {{was used to}} obtain fluid speeds in a meander of the Nottawasaga River, Ontario. The meter was placed at 3 m increments of width and at 0. 10 – 0. 45 m increments of depth in 13 cross-sections of the meander. Hardy's multiquadric method of interpolation, using a cone model, was implemented to estimate and map speeds more fully for each cross-section. The multiquadric system of equations was evaluated {{for a range of}} about 7 – 11 (× 103) locations in each of nine shallow cross-sections in the upstream limb of the meander and for about 22 – 63 (× 103) locations in each of four deeper sections in the downstream limb. These evaluated speeds were grouped into colour-coded classes and plotted to show the distribution of speeds in each cross-section. In all but two sections, there was one concentration of higher speeds which shifted towards the <b>outer</b> <b>bank</b> of the meander. The other two sections had double concentrations of high speeds. One section had a cluster at the surface, midstream and another at the bed, close to the <b>outer</b> <b>bank.</b> In the second section, one cluster was at the surface close to the <b>outer</b> <b>bank</b> and the other was near the bed midstream, confirming the action of helical flow in the meander. The mapping showed horizontal gradients of speed just as clearly as vertical and oblique gradients, especially where the talweg was close to the <b>outer</b> <b>bank...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper reports {{peculiar}} {{results of}} experimental investigation on the secondary circulation motion of flow along a meander wave. Experiments {{were conducted in}} a large amplitude meandering laboratory channel for two values of the width-to-depth ratio. Here attention is focalized on how secondary motion affects the bank shear stress distribution, influencing {{the stability of the}} <b>outer</b> <b>bank.</b> The analysis essentially highlights that, especially for small width-to-depth ratio, as the channel curvature increases, besides the classical central-region secondary circulation cell a counter-rotating circulation cell forms in the outer-bank region. Such counter-rotating circulation cell allows the bank shear stress to obtain small values at the <b>outer</b> <b>bank...</b>|$|R
40|$|Flow {{processes}} {{near the}} (concave) <b>outer</b> <b>bank</b> in curved river reaches are investigated {{in a laboratory}} flume, with focus {{on the influence of}} the bank roughness. An outer-bank cell of reversed secondary flow occurs for all the investigated roughness configurations of the <b>outer</b> <b>bank.</b> The cell widens the outer-bank boundary layer, which reduces the flow forcing on the bank, but also advects high-momentum fluid toward {{the lower part of the}} bank, which enhances the flow forcing on the bank. Increasing the roughness of the <b>outer</b> <b>bank</b> causes a considerable widening and strengthening of the outer-bank cell, which amplifies both effects on the flow forcing. The widening of the outer-bank boundary layer induced by the outer-bank cell reduces the effective width of the channel, i. e., the width where most of the discharge is conveyed, which increases significantly the sediment transport capacity in the central part of the channel. The near-bank processes are qualitatively similar but show considerable quantitative variations around the bend. The outer-bank cell reaches its maximum strength in the zone that is most vulnerable to bed scour and bank erosion, which corroborates its morphological relevance. The outer cell is mainly generated by reversed near-surface gradients in the profile of the streamwise velocity. The anisotropy of the cross-stream turbulence is the major mechanism opposed to the outer-bank cell. Increasing roughness of the <b>outer</b> <b>bank</b> amplifies all dominant mechanisms but does not modify their relative importance. The relevance of the experimental results for natural curved river configurations is discussed...|$|R
50|$|Radiocarbon dating {{indicates}} that the ramparts defending Maiden Castle were built in around 600 BC. Built from earth and timber, the inner rampart was originally 20 ft wide, with a revetment of dry stone walling behind the bank, and at least 10 ft high. The <b>outer</b> <b>bank</b> was originally 25 ft wide and about 10 ft high. It was built from sand and had a dry stone facing at the front and no revetment behind. The <b>outer</b> <b>bank</b> was later enlarged: the outer face was extended 8 to 10 ft away from the fort and the revetment moved. Its height was probably increased to 12 ft. The defences cover about 1.66 acre out of the entire 3 acre of the Maiden Castle site. According to archaeologist James Forde-Johnston, who conducted {{a study of the}} hill forts of Lancashire and Cheshire in 1962, this was an unusually strong defence for such a small site.
