40|$|A {{field study}} was {{established}} to evaluate <b>oxadiargyl</b> and pendimethalin during the wet seasons in Bangladesh in 2012 and 2013. The study evaluated the following treatments: <b>oxadiargyl</b> applied at 80, 120, and 160  g ai ha− 1; pendimethalin at 800, 1200, and 1600  g ai ha− 1; partial weedy; and weed-free. Rice plant density was greatly affected by weed control treatment. Lower density and lower uniformity of the rice plant stand occurred {{as a result of}} increased rates of herbicides. Increased rates of pendimethalin were more toxic than increased rates of <b>oxadiargyl.</b> Both herbicides effectively controlled Digitaria ciliaris, Echinochloa colona, and Phyllanthus niruri; however, they were unable to control Murdannia nudiflora. <b>Oxadiargyl</b> controlled Cyperus rotundus across rates by 31 – 55 %, but pendimethalin was completely ineffective on it, and higher rates of both herbicides had no effect in controlling this weed. Both herbicides at higher rates reduced total weed biomass significantly. Among herbicide treatments, the highest yield (3. 7 – 4. 0  t ha− 1) was recorded in plots treated with <b>oxadiargyl</b> at 160  g ai ha− 1 and the lowest yield (2. 4 – 2. 8  t ha− 1) was in plots treated with pendimethalin at 1600  g ai ha− 1. Results from our study suggest that a higher rate of <b>oxadiargyl</b> can increase yield by suppressing weeds in dry-seeded rice systems. Similar to the results of <b>oxadiargyl,</b> pendimethalin at higher rates also greatly suppressed weeds; however, yield decreased due to phytotoxicity to rice seedlings...|$|E

40|$|Valerian (Valeriana officinalis L.) is a {{medicinal}} plant, but its cultivation {{is restricted}} by weed competition. Therefore, three rates (0. 75 X, 1 X, and 1. 25 X, where X {{is equal to}} the recommended dose of haloxyfop-R (methyl ester), sethoxydim, <b>oxadiargyl,</b> bentazon, oxadiazon, and oxyfluorfen) were applied at the 3 - 4 leaf stages to valerian plants. This application was done to select the herbicide type and rate for post-controlling broadleaf and grasses weeds in this species. Herbicide injury, Soil-Plant Analyses Development (SPAD) reading, number of leaves per plant, stem diameter, and fresh and dry weights were determined 10, 20, and 30 days after herbicide application. Oxyfluorfen application caused the most herbicide injury followed by bentazon. Injury increased as the rate and the days after application increased. Oxadiazon only caused significant damage 30 days after application under all three rates. Other treatments showed no marked injuries under any rate or date after application, as compared with the control. Effects on other measured traits depended on the trait, herbicide, and herbicide rate. The highest SPAD, leaf number, shoot diameter, fresh weight and dry weight, was recorded under application of 30 mg a. i. ∙ kg- 1 soil <b>oxadiargyl</b> and 90 mg a. i. ∙ kg- 1 soil oxadiazon, 81 mg a. i. ∙ kg- 1 soil haloxyfop-R, 37. 5 mg a. i. ∙ kg- 1 soil <b>oxadiargyl,</b> 22. 5 mg a. i. ∙ kg- 1 soil <b>oxadiargyl,</b> 81 mg a. i. ∙ kg- 1 soil haloxyfop-R, and 81 mg a. i. ∙ kg- 1 soil haloxyfop-R, respectively.

40|$|Summary Effective weed {{management}} strategies are limited for capsicum and chilli producers. Current weed management practices {{include the use}} of plastic mulch, selective grass herbicides, handweeding or tillage. There are currently no herbicides registered for broadleaf weed control in capsicums or chillies. Potential new herbicides were screened and efficacy, crop safety and residue data was generated.

The most effective herbicides identified from this work were pendimethalin, clomazone and <b>oxadiargyl,</b> which all gave best results when applied pre crop transplanting. All three products provided effective pre emergent control of a range of common broadleaf and grass weeds across a number of sites.

The experiment included five treatments, composed of organic and mineral fertilizers, alone and mixed at different rates, along with a control and six weed control treatments, including <b>oxadiargyl,</b> prometryn, hand hoeing treatments alone or mixed with the herbicides, and a nonweeded treatment (control). The herbicide treatments were not superior to the two hand-hoeing treatments. Using compost favored growth and yield of faba bean more than of weeds. Adding fertilizer also improved most yield parameters. Application of compost alone or combined with 50 or 100 % of the recommended NPK rate improved faba bean growth in terms of net assimilation rate, specific leaf area, and leaf weight ratio as components of relative growth rate. This improvement in growth resulted in increase of seed yield, yield components and protein of faba bean. Faba bean yield performance improved under interactive fertilizer effects and weed control treatments as growth improved, {{as a result of}} nutrient release from fertilizers and weed control...|$|E

The purpose of study was researching on seedling medias, seed rates, kinds of nutrient for sprayed on seedling in concrete seed bed nursery, seedling ages, number of seedlings/clump, clump spacing and compare machine transplanting method with other planting methods for increasing yields and quality of rice seed with easy management. The results showed that burned hull was convenient for seedling media, because {{it was easy to}} find and low cost, but only used in soil seed bed nursery. For concrete seed nursery, mixing of burned hull with soil was better. The optimal seeding rate was 200 – 250 g dry seed/tray, caused to using 45 and 40 seeding trays/rai. by respectively. In concrete seed bed nursery, application of 15 g urea and 15 cc silicon solution (Si 20 %). mixed in 20 L water need for increasing height and vigor seedling. 18 days seedling for transplanting had appropriate height for transplanting. However for rice seed production, 10 – 12 seedlings/clump and 16 cm clump spacing was better in case of former crop rice seed control. Weedy rice herbicide control with dimethenamid (FrontierR) and <b>oxadiargyl</b> (RaftR) in directed seed broadcasting could control former crop rice seed better than transplanting, but highly limit using especially in area with water level uncontrollable and in rainy former crop rice seed better than transplanting machine but it required more labors and not rapidly like transplanting machine, so transplanting was more efficiency...|$|E
