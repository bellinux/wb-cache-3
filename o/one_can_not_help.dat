40|$|UNASUR {{currently}} {{represents one}} of the most promising regionalization projects currently taking place. One of its unique characteristics is the high level of security sector integration that has already taken place in the short few years since its inception. This is particularly interesting as it is in stark contrast with the security sector regionalization of Europe. Despite its much longer history of regionalization, European security sector integration is still fragmented into many different organizations with overlapping goals, and whose members often include countries outside the European boarder. In the face of this apparent success in its regionalist ambitions, <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> but question: What is the logic behind South American security sector regionalism under UNASUR? Furthermore, how and why does its regionalists efforts differ from those of the EU? Through an analysis of how Regional Security Complex Theory, New Regionalism Approach, and Post-Hegemonic Regionalism interpret both the genesis and functionality of UNASUR, one is able to find some important insights with regards to South America’s security sector integration. Geographically contingent security concerns, intensified by the impacts of globalization, has lead South American states to pursuit a unique security arrangement, which rejects the neoliberal orthodoxy and the hegemonic presence of the United States. Unlike Europe, South America’s security complex does not overlap with other regions and, most importantly, does not include the presence of the United Sates. Furthermore, Europe has carried over many of its Cold War era security mechanisms, in large part due to its embrace of the Washington Consensus and the neoliberal economic orthodoxy. This analysis addresses the broader issues regarding the transferability of theoretical approaches across different regions, but perhaps more interestingly it hints at the potential for the wider security regionalization of the Americas, and whether it will seek to align with, or reject the presence of the US hegemon...|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} {{of the relationship of}} streptococci to the etiology of infectious arthritis and of rheumatic fever is of the utmost importance. If a streptococcus or group of streptococci could be shown to be associated See PDF for Structure with either disease, some form of specific treatment might be available. The possibility of primary streptococcic infection as the cause of rheumatic fever, and, to a less extent, of acute infectious arthritis {{would seem to be a}} reasonable conjecture because of the frequency of associated throat, sinus or other focal infection. To consider that these same streptococci remain in or about the affected joint and to such an extent that they are found in the blood stream in cases of chronic infectious arthritis of years' duration demands a rather unique conception. Recent investigative work has certainly tended to confirm the importance of streptococci in these diseases, but, if all the published reports are considered as a group, <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> being impressed with the inconsistency and peculiarities of the findings. In blood cultures from cases of rheumatic fever Clawson (7) recovered Streptococcus viridans, Small (8) and Birkhaug (9) non-hemolytic (gamma type) streptococci, and Cecil et al. (3) Streptococcus viridans, rarely hemolytic and non-hemolytic streptococci. In blood cultures from cases of infectious arthritis Cecil et al. (2) recovered attenuated hemolytic streptococci and occasionally Streptococcus viridans, non-hemolytic streptococci and diphtheroids and Margolis and Dorsey (10) green-producing and indifferent streptococci and diphtheroids, whereas from synovial fluids and regional lymph nodes Forkner, Shands and Poston (4) and Poston (5) obtained Streptococcus viridans and Margolis and Dorsey (11) recovered green-producing and indifferent streptococci and diphtheroids from epiphyseal marrows, bones and synovial membranes. On the other hand, Jordan (12) and Nye and Seegal (13) and the work reported in this paper have failed to confirm these findings. If a streptococcus is the infective agent, it is difficult to explain why the organisms recovered so consistently by certain groups of investigators are so different and why the findings of other groups are entirely negative. The chances of contamination, even with the most careful manipulation, are extremely favorable when using a cultural technique which demands subculturing a fluid medium every 3 to 5 days for a period of 4 to 6 weeks. The question arises as to what organisms should be considered as contaminants. Cultures found to contain Staphylococcus albus have never been judged significant. Margolis and Dorsey (11) have excluded Gram-positive bacilli from their series, but have included diphtheroids. Cecil et al. (2) reported the recovery of diphtheroids and Micrococcus zymogenes from blood cultures which they did not consider contaminated. Jordan (12) recovered short Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive bacilli and questioned their importance. The occurrence of such bacteria would appear to be not unlike that of the non-hemolytic (gamma type) streptococci reported by Small (7), Birkhaug (9) and, rarely, by Cecil et al. (2) and Margolis and Dorsey (10, 11). In the work reported in this paper and in previously published work (13) with blood cultures from cases of rheumatic fever, staphylococci, Gram-positive bacilli and diplococci and diphtheroids have been isolated from a certain number of the cultures. Since these were found, as a rule, in only 1 of 2 or more cultures from the same blood and since such organisms occurred about as frequently in cultures from control cases, they have been considered merely contaminants. The findings in the 9 cases of arthritis with positive blood cultures reported by Margolis and Dorsey (10) are certainly far from convincing. These authors found green-producing streptococci in 5 of the 9 cases, but duplicate cultures on the same blood, with one exception, were always negative and the two repeat cultures were negative. Furthermore, in the 3 cases yielding indifferent streptococci in one subculture all subsequent subcultures were negative. In the work reported in this paper a green-producing and a non-hemolytic streptococcus were isolated from blood cultures, but a Gram-positive diplococcus and a Gram-positive bacillus, respectively, were recovered from the same cultures. A consideration of the above would seem to point to the probability, even certainty, of streptococci occurring in some cultures as contaminants; and the work of Olitsky and Long (14) and Long, Olitsky and Stewart (15) has clearly demonstrated that the air contamination of cultures of ground material with non-hemolytic green-producing streptococci can occur just as easily as with diphtheroids and staphylococci. It is obvious, in such cases, that the types of organisms recovered are dependent on the flora of the air of the laboratory or of the throat of the laboratory worker, and this point may well explain the differences in the cultural findings under consideration. A number of years ago numerous articles (16 – 19) appeared relative to the bacteriologic flora of lymph nodes, particularly those from cases of Hodgkin's disease, and it is interesting to note that the organisms recovered were quite similar to those which have been recovered from the blood and tissues of cases of arthritis and rheumatic fever, with the exception that the diphtheroids were, at that time, much more in prominence. Regardless of elaborate serological studies and animal experiments, streptococci must be recovered consistently by several groups of laboratory workers before their etiologic rôle in chronic arthritis and rheumatic fever can be accepted. Duplicate cultures and repeat cultures should yield the same organism in a generous percentage of cases and cultures from cases of other diseases or from normal persons should be negative. Positive cultures from duplicate cultures opened only at the time when the first culture showed growth would make the findings more significant than if the whole series were subcultured every 3 to 5 days. The work of Cecil, Nicholls and Stainsby on the bacteriology of the blood and joints in chronic arthritis and rheumatic fever has apparently been carried out most carefully and thoroughly and their results are very consistent and convincing. In spite of attempts to follow their methods in the selection of patients and in cultural technique, the results on the relatively small series of cases which are reported here fail to confirm their findings...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{observability}} is of key importance for a consistent defense of Constructive Empiricism. This anti-realist position, originally presented in 1980 by Bas van Fraassen {{in his book}} The Scientific Image, crucially depends on the observable/unobservable dichotomy. Nevertheless, {{the question of what}} it means to observe has been faced in an unsatisfactory and inadequate manner by van Fraassen and this represents an important lacuna in his philosophical position. The aim of this work is to propose a characterization of the act of observation able to give the necessary support to the ‘rough guide’ of ‘observable’ that can be found in the aforementioned book. Countering van Fraassen’s own statements, that observability is not a matter for philosophy, but for scientific inquiry only, we maintain that any attempt to deal with this subject by the philosophers is legitimate. We will show that van Fraassen ended up doing a philosophical analysis of observation himself, albeit in a fragmentary way. We believe that this question should be dealt with methodically, though, ‘following the rules’ of a ‘proper’ philosophical analysis, as we attempted to do in this work. We will propose a way of conceiving the act of observation, different from van Fraassen’s <b>one,</b> that <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>not</b> only to ground the distinction between observable and unobservable, upon which Constructive Empiricism rests, but to get this anti-realist position closer to scientific practice as well, which is one of its desiderata. Without neglecting the philosophical dimension of the issue, though. However, this proposal does not represent an ad hoc ‘solution’ for Constructive Empiricism, but a characterization aspiring to have a universal reach...|$|R
