5|$|Subfossils {{were also}} {{recovered}} during the 1860s, but more complete remains were found during the 1874 transit of Venus, since an <b>observation</b> <b>station</b> was {{located on the}} island. Many of these excavations were requested by brothers Alfred and Edward Newton, who used them to describe the osteology of the bird in detail. Thousands of bones were excavated, and mounted skeletons were composed from the remains of several specimens. It {{has been suggested that}} the skeleton of this species is the best described after that of humans. In spite of this, some later scholars doubted Leguat's story, and the existence of the Rodrigues solitaire. In 1955, George Evelyn Hutchinson doubted aspects of the bird's biology mentioned by Leguat, and in 1921, G. Atkinson claimed the memoir was merely a novel, and that the man had never even existed. Today, it is widely accepted that Leguat's memoirs are credible observations of the bird in life.|$|E
5|$|The cyclone inflicted heavy citrus losses, {{and one-third}} of the trees were uprooted in many groves. Agricultural losses reached $20 million (1949 USD), {{including}} 14 million boxes of fruit. Wind gusts of 75mph (120km/h) affected Clermont, and numerous central Florida communities reported severe damage from the winds. The <b>observation</b> <b>station</b> at Archbold Biological Station reported peak wind gusts of 110mph (175km/h); the town of Sebring reported 125mph (205km/h) gusts, which caused damage to trees and severe structural damage to buildings. Estimations of property damage reached $100,000 (1949 USD) in the town, and local citrus groves estimated losses near $2,000,000 (1949 USD). Buildings received considerable damage in the Lake Placid area, and telegraph, telephone, rail, and bus services were disrupted. Flooding affected Georgia and the Carolinas, although the rains alleviated drought conditions in Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York, and New England. Charleston, South Carolina reported a wind gust of 80mph (129km/h), and power lines were damaged. In Maryland, damage was minimal, although trees were prostrated and electrical services were down. Two {{people were killed in}} Florida, but advance warnings prevented a higher death toll.|$|E

30|$|Based on the in situ joint {{gravity and}} GPS {{observations}} {{conducted in the}} past several years, a dense network was constructed between the Sichuan Basin and the eastern Tibetan Plateau (Fig.  2). Then, the regional FGAs and Bouguer gravity anomalies of the study area are updated. The accuracy of the computed FGAs at and near the <b>observation</b> <b>stations</b> is high. Yet the one associated with areas far away from the <b>observation</b> <b>stations</b> is not high, because FGAs can be profoundly affected by the local topography. To render FGAs for areas far from <b>observation</b> <b>stations</b> more accurate (Fig.  2), the in situ observations are merged with EGM 2008 data using a remove-and-restore algorithm (Pavlis et al. 2012). The new FGAs fields show pairs of positive and negative anomalies along the edges of the Sichuan Basin and the eastern Tibetan Plateau (Fig.  5 b), in much more detail than the results found using EGM 2008 data alone.|$|R

30|$|The GPS {{and gravity}} in situ {{observations}} of LMS area were made along roads, {{all of which}} were located in deep gorges among high mountains. The computed FGAs at the <b>observation</b> <b>stations</b> are undoubtedly of high accuracy. However, the computed FGAs associated with areas far away from <b>observation</b> <b>stations</b> are considered less accurate, because they are profoundly affected by the local topography (Fig.  3 a). More specifically, the variation of elevation will induce a change of gravity, and the magnitude is about 0.3086  mGal per meter. Accordingly, attempting to determine FGAs at the other sides of mountains or into deep gorges by conventional interpolation method (Kriging interpolation used in Fig.  3) can involve considerable error.|$|R

30|$|Associated {{with the}} 2004 {{earthquake}} off {{the west coast}} of northern Sumatra, changes in groundwater levels or pressures were observed at many <b>observation</b> <b>stations</b> in Japan which are more than 5000 km from the hypocenter. At 38 of the 45 <b>observation</b> <b>stations,</b> there were changes in groundwater levels or pressures. At the 10 <b>observation</b> <b>stations</b> in which the Ishii-type borehole strain instruments were established, changes in crustal strains were also observed. A major part of the changes in crustal strains and groundwater levels or pressures were dynamic oscillations due to a seismic wave. At some stations, coseismic or postseismic rises or drops were also observed. At five stations where both crustal stain and groundwater levels or pressures were observed, postseismic changes in groundwater levels or pressures were consistent with coseismic static steps in crustal strains. At the other five stations, postseismic changes in groundwater levels or pressures did not agree with the coseismic static steps. At two stations of these five stations, it is anticipated that the pore water pressure change in each aquifer locally occurred independently of the change in crustal strain. At another station, postseismic changes in groundwater level possessed the same characteristics as a model removing the temporary deposition. At the last two stations, the causes of the changes are unknown.|$|R
