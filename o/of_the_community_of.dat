5|$|In Houghton County, FFH16 and M-28 {{meet in the}} Duncan Township {{community}} of Kenton. The former roadway turns east and runs concurrently along the latter one for approximately a quarter mile (0.4km) before turning northward again, leaving town near the cemetery. The forest highway tracks due north until Bob Lake. There the roadway meanders through the area near another National Forest campground and crosses into eastern Ontonagon County. FFH16 crosses back into Houghton County one last time. Immediately after crossing the county line, the forest highway terminates at an intersection with M-38 west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>of</b> Nisula.|$|E
5|$|In Menominee County, the {{environment}} {{takes on a}} more agricultural character along US2. The highway passes through the edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>of</b> Hermansville before entering Powers. US2 comes to a three-way intersection and turns northeast merging onto US41. The concurrent highway runs from Powers through the communities of Wilson and Spaulding {{on the south side}} of the CN Railway. At Harris, the trunkline enters the Hannahville Indian Community. Harris is on the Menominee County side of the reservation, but as the highway continues east, it crosses over to Bark River on the Delta County side. The county line in between not only separates the two communities, but also serves as the boundary between the Central and Eastern time zones. East of Bark River, the highway crosses the community's namesake waterway before intersecting the eastern terminus of M‑69. The roadway crosses the Ford River prior to turning due east into the outskirts of Escanaba.|$|E

5|$|Just north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>of</b> Hale {{the road}} enters the Huron National Forest near Loon Lake. The {{trunkline}} takes a {{turn to the}} east as it passes along the Au Sable River. The River Road National Scenic Byway starts on M-65 at Rollways Road, and the highway generally follows the river as it passes by a former logging community which is commemorated by Lumberman's Monument. At the intersection with River Road, M-65 turns north to cross the Au Sable, and the byway designation continues east along River Road to follow the river to Oscoda. The M-65 bridge over the Au Sable is just downstream of the Five Channels Dam, crossing high above the water below. The highway turns northwesterly through forest land to cross into Alcona County. North of the county line, the trunkline follows Baker and State roads near Vaughn and Hunters lakes. M-65 meets the western terminus of county road F-30 {{in the community of}} Glennie. The highway also crosses the South Branch of the Pine River.|$|E

5|$|M-81 {{starts at}} a {{junction}} with M-13, {{with the two}} directions of each highway separated by a median. This central feature ends for M-81 immediately east of the intersection as the highway runs east out of Saginaw. The trunkline follows Washington Road easterly through residential subdivisions to an interchange with I-75/US23 in an industrial area of Buena Vista Township. This interchange, exit151 along the freeway, is built with roundabouts {{on either side of}} the bridge that carries Washington Road over the freeway in a variant of the diamond interchange design called a dumbbell interchange. After leaving the industrial properties on the east side of I-75/US23, M-81 follows Washington Road through a mixture of farm fields and residential subdivisions. North <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>of</b> Arthur, the highway intersects M-15 (Vassar Road). Further east, M-81 crosses out of Saginaw County; across the border in Tuscola County, the highway follows Saginaw Road.|$|E
5|$|MD32 {{begins at}} a partial {{cloverleaf}} interchange with I-97 and MD3 (Robert Crain Highway) in Millersville. MD32 starts {{as a pair}} of two-lane flyover ramps that split west from northbound I-97 and join southbound I-97; the MD32 ramps head northwest while I-97 curves to the northeast and settles into the wide median of the northern end of MD3. After passing through its interchange with MD3, MD32 heads northwest as the Patuxent Freeway, a four-lane freeway that passes to the north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>of</b> Gambrills. The state highway's first interchange is with Sappington Station Road, a spur from the westbound ramps of MD32 that is unsigned MD32AA.
