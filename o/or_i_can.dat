500|$|Tin Toy gained Disney's attention, and the {{new team}} at The Walt Disney Company—CEO Michael Eisner and {{chairman}} Jeffrey Katzenberg in the film division —began a quest to get Lasseter to come back. Lasseter, grateful for Jobs' faith in him, felt compelled to stay with Pixar, telling co-founder Ed Catmull, [...] "I can go to Disney and be a director, <b>or</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> stay here and make history." [...] Katzenberg realized he could not lure Lasseter back to Disney and therefore set plans into motion to ink a production deal with Pixar to produce a film. Disney had always made all their movies in-house and refused to change this. But when Tim Burton, {{who used to work}} at Disney, wanted to buy back the rights to The Nightmare Before Christmas, Disney struck a deal allowing him to make it as a Disney movie outside the studio. This opened the door for Pixar to make their movies outside Disney.|$|E

2500|$|In a blog post, he {{expanded}} on this, {{discussing the}} film's symbolism, imagery and Trier's intentions, calling him [...] "one {{of the most}} heroic directors in the world" [...] and Antichrist [...] "a powerfully-made film that contains material many audiences will find repulsive or unbearable. The performances by Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg are heroic and fearless. Trier's visual command is striking. The use of music is evocative; no score, but operatic and liturgical arias. And if you can think beyond what he shows to what he implies, its depth are [...] frightening." [...] Duane Dudek of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel called Antichrist [...] "Trier's most visually lush and technically rigorous film; it captures things at a molecular level and in a slow motion that all but brings the world to a halt... But paradoxically, this is his most unwatchable film, and many will find its violence and cruelty, including scenes of genital mutilation, repellent. I cannot recommend Antichrist, but {{in a culture that}} hemorrhages death and torture nightly on shows like 24 <b>or</b> , <b>I</b> <b>can</b> understand it." ...|$|E
