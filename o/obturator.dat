5|$|The pudendal nerve passes {{between the}} {{piriformis}} muscle and coccygeus (ischiococcygeus) muscles {{and leaves the}} pelvis through {{the lower part of}} the greater sciatic foramen. It crosses over the lateral part of the sacrospinous ligament and reenters the pelvis through the lesser sciatic foramen. After reentering the pelvis, it accompanies the internal pudendal artery and internal pudendal vein upwards and forwards along the lateral wall of the ischiorectal fossa, being contained in a sheath of the <b>obturator</b> fascia termed the pudendal canal, along with the internal pudendal blood vessels.|$|E
5|$|Because it {{displays}} features {{common to}} both birds and non-avian dinosaurs, Archaeopteryx {{has often been}} considered a link between them. In the 1970s, John Ostrom, following Thomas Henry Huxley's lead in 1868, argued that birds evolved within theropod dinosaurs and Archaeopteryx was a critical piece of evidence for this argument; it had several avian features, such as a wishbone, flight feathers, wings, and a partially reversed first toe along with dinosaur and theropod features. For instance, it has a long ascending process of the ankle bone, interdental plates, an <b>obturator</b> process of the ischium, and long chevrons in the tail. In particular, Ostrom found that Archaeopteryx was remarkably similar to the theropod family Dromaeosauridae.|$|E
40|$|The study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} <b>obturators</b> on respiratory function by analyzing the changes in nasal anatomic structures and physiologic function in maxillectomy patients with and without <b>obturators.</b> Twenty-six patients who underwent maxillectomy were chosen and rehabilitated with <b>obturators</b> by a single maxillofacial prosthodontist. The geometric shape of the nasal cavity, the nasal airway resistance, and the ratio of residual volume to total lung capacity (RV/TLC) were evaluated using acoustic rhinometry, rhinomanometry, and a pulmonary function test apparatus, respectively. All patients were tested twice, with and without their <b>obturators.</b> The results were statistically analyzed with a paired t-test. The nasal cavities (0 - 7 cm to the anterior nostril) of the patients with <b>obturators</b> had a significantly smaller volume ([- 8. 92, - 0. 60], P = 0. 027), smaller effective nasal cross-sectional area MCA 2 ([- 3. 80, - 1, 81], P < 0. 0001), increased airflow in the nasal cavity ([17. 76, 147. 39], P = 0. 015), reduced nasal airway resistance ([- 0. 11, - 0. 02], P = 0. 009), and reduced RV/TLC ([- 5. 32, - 1. 30], P = 0. 004) compared with the patients without <b>obturators.</b> According {{to the results of}} this study, <b>obturators</b> can improve respiratory function by effectively decreasing the volume of enlarged nasal cavities as well as the nasal air resistance and volume of anatomical dead space after maxillectomy...|$|R

5|$|Three {{channels}} facilitate lymphatic drainage {{from the}} cervix. The anterior and lateral cervix drains to nodes along the uterine arteries, travelling along the cardinal ligaments {{at the base}} of the broad ligament to the external iliac lymph nodes and ultimately the paraaortic lymph nodes. The posterior and lateral cervix drains along the uterine arteries to the internal iliac lymph nodes and ultimately the paraaortic lymph nodes, and the posterior section of the cervix drains to the <b>obturator</b> and presacral lymph nodes. However, there are variations as lymphatic drainage from the cervix travels to different sets of pelvic nodes in some people.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the apical sealing ability of {{different}} core materials used with Epiphany TM sealer and to evaluate the effect of Resilon/Epiphany TM system on creating an apical mono-block seal. Methods: Fifty-five extracted human teeth were used. Forty-five were selected and randomly divided into three groups and ten teeth were used as positive and negative control groups. In Group 1, roots were obturated using Resilon ™ and Epiphany™, In Group 2, roots were obturated using tapered single-cone gutta-percha and Epiphany ™ and in Group 3, roots were obturated using Thermafil <b>obturators</b> and Epiphany ™ sealer. The apical leakage was measured using the dye penetration methodology. The teeth were cleared, and the linear extent of dye penetration was measured with a stereomicroscope.

25|$|The lumbar plexus {{block is}} an {{advanced}} technique indicated for hip, anterior thigh, and knee surgery. The lumbar plexus {{is composed of}} nerves originating from L1 to L4 spinal roots such as the iliohypogastric, ilioinguinal, genitofemoral, lateral femoral cutaneous, femoral, and <b>obturator</b> nerves. Since the plexus is located deep, there is {{an increased risk of}} local anesthetic toxicity, so less toxic anesthetics like chloroprocaine or mepivacaine mixed with ropivacaine are often recommended. A curvilinear ultrasound probe can be used but {{it is often difficult to}} see the plexus, so a nerve stimulator is used to locate it.|$|E
25|$|Supraglottic airway — a supraglottic airway (SGA) is any {{airway device}} that is seated above {{and outside the}} trachea, as an {{alternative}} to endotracheal intubation. Most devices work via masks or cuffs that inflate to isolate the trachea for oxygen delivery. Newer devices feature esophageal ports for suctioning or ports for tube exchange to allow intubation. Supraglottic airways differ primarily from tracheal intubation in that they do not prevent aspiration. After the introduction of the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) in 1998, supraglottic airway devices have become mainstream in both elective and emergency anesthesia. There are many types of SGAs available including the Esophageal-tracheal Combitube (ETC), Laryngeal tube (LT), and the obsolete Esophageal <b>obturator</b> airway (EOA).|$|E

40|$|The pollen-pistil {{interaction}} {{has been}} examined in kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa). In this species {{a large number}} of seeds are produced in each fruit and a great many pollen grains germinate and grow to reach the ovules. This growth is assisted by an abundant secretion that is present all along the pistilar tract. At anthesis, the stigma is covered by a secretion where the pollen grains germinate and grow. The stylar transmitting tissue is initially rich in starch reserves, but the starch gradually disappears and, concomitantly, an abundant secretion that stains for carbohydrates appears in all of the intercellular spaces. Pollen tube growth relies on this secretion since it is depleted after pollen tube passage, while in unpollinated flowers it remains unaltered throughout the flower life-span. In the ovary a similar situation occurs. The placental surface, where the pollen tubes grow before reaching the ovules, is covered by a number of <b>obturators.</b> At anthesis, these <b>obturators</b> are rich in starch reserves and have an abundant secretion on their outer surface. As time passes, starch disappears while the secretion increases. It is in this secretion that the pollen tubes grow on their way toward the ovules. These observations are discussed in terms of the support given by the pistil to pollen tube growth to achieve the highly successful reproductive performance of this species...|$|R

25|$|Metastasis in {{ovarian cancer}} {{is very common}} in the abdomen, and occurs via exfoliation, where cancer cells burst through the ovarian capsule {{and are able to}} move freely {{throughout}} the peritoneal cavity. Ovarian cancer metastases usually grow on the surface of organs rather than the inside; they are also common on the omentum and the peritoneal lining. Cancer cells can also travel through the lymphatic system and metastasize to lymph nodes connected to the ovaries via blood vessels; i.e. the lymph nodes along the infundibulopelvic ligament, the broad ligament, and the round ligament. The most commonly affected groups include the paraaortic, hypogastric, external iliac, <b>obturator,</b> and inguinal lymph nodes. Usually, ovarian cancer does not metastasize to the liver, lung, brain, or kidneys unless it is recurrent disease; this differentiates ovarian cancer from many other forms of cancer.|$|E
40|$|Aim To {{investigate}} {{by means}} of a fluid filtration whether immediate or delayed post space preparation and post cementation may influence the apical seal associated with Thermafil <b>Obturators</b> (Dentsply Maillefer, Switzerland). Methodology Fifty-four single-rooted teeth were randomly divided into five experimental (n = 10) and two control (n = 2) groups. Crowns were removed with a diamond bur at the cemento-enamel junction. Canals were shaped with Mtwo (Sweden & Martina, Italy), smeared with Pulp Canal Sealer (SybronEndo, USA) and filled with Thermafil <b>Obturators</b> (Dentsply Maillefer). Filled canals were subjected to the following protocols: G 1, no other treatment; G 2, post space preparation with Thermafil Post Space Bur (Dentsply Maillefer); G 3, post space preparation with Thermafil Post Space Bur and D. T. light post (RTD, France) cementation; G 4 and G 5, as G 2 and G 3, the same respectively, after one week saline storage.
