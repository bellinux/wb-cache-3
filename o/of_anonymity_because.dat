40|$|Abstract — E-cash {{algorithms}} offer strong protection on principal anonymity, transaction {{authenticity and}} quota enforcement of credit dispense {{but as of}} {{now there is no}} study on how to integrate them with the resource allocation schemes. In this paper, we propose a hypercube based tracking system for both credit dispense and resource allocation of computing assets using E-cash algorithms. Hypercube is chosen as the common references of the two major functions, so that the study results can be tailored {{for a wide range of}} data structures that could be used for both purposes. Based on the N-divisibility framework of disposable authentication, we develop the analysis techniques to assess the security properties using hypercube to track credit spending and for subcube allocation for two different schemes. The first scheme is highly secure yet has high computing costs. On the other hand, the second scheme can achieve the same security goals at much lower computing costs by relaxing anonymity protection rules but adding a simple anonymity hazard checking routine before a subcube can be spent/allocated. Anonymity hazard refers to the condition that the unique secret (commonly called the identity) assigned to a token can be deciphered from messages generated from transactions even when no double spending occurs. Simulations results show that well known subcube allocation schemes binary code and binary gray code are free <b>of</b> <b>anonymity</b> hazards <b>because</b> <b>of</b> their restrictive allocation rules. Anonymity hazards can occur to an unrestricted subcube allocation scheme if the anonymity hazard checking routine is not devised. Our study suggests that by decoupling of credit management and resource management, highly secure and efficient computing resource management schemes can be developed based on one integrated framework...|$|R

5000|$|A similar scene {{took place}} in the Upper Egyptian {{governorate}} of Luxor, where a flotilla consisting of boats and motor launches packed with people in hundreds waving Egyptian flags and chanting [...] "Leave Morsi!" [...] accompanied by drums, reportedly sailed down the Nile voicing their opposition to the president. Both river banks saw a significant number of protesters in a city that rarely witnesses unrest, with masses demonstrating across Luxor en route to one of their rallying points at the governorate building, where a sit-in was planned until their demands are met. There was a line of men on the corniche holding hands and making a corridor packed with women of all ages into the front, sealing off area of the governor’s office. Luxor Temple was the site another gathering, where marches from Karnak, Sawagi and Awamea had met and the temple's exterior became full in the afternoon despite the stifling heat that day. 3,500 anti-Morsi demonstrators were reported in the city of Aswan south of the Luxor and Qena governorates. There were escalating verbal confrontations between opponents and supporters of Morsi in Aswan's main Shohadah Square as lawyers had gathered for a march heading to the square from the city court. Tamarod, joined by a number of parties such as the Wafd Party, announced an open ended sit-in in Sohag, where tens of thousands closed the governorate office with chains, setting up protest tents and blocking state employees from entering the building. In the provincial capital's Culture Square, the city's largest, revolutionary forces have announced their intention to march after mid-day prayers. Shops were closed and the city's trading activity was relatively calm. The protesters chanted against the Brotherhood and called for national unity between Muslims and Christians while other marches were arriving from all over Sohag and from surrounding villages. On the other hand, hundreds of Islamists and their supporters gathered in front of the city's Korman mosque in support of Morsi. A near confrontation would inevitable between pro and anti-Morsi demonstrators if the police had not intervened forcing the Islamists to abandon the site for Tamarod. Tahta, another city in the Sohag Governorate, witnessed thousands in its main streets demanding the ouster of President Mohamed Morsi. The governorate of Assiut, an Islamist stronghold which was the site of this day's deadliest clashes, a drive-by {{took place in}} the capital Assiut where it was estimated that more than 50,000 were protesting in the city by night. Gunmen on a motorcycle opened fire on a protest in which tens of thousands were participating, killing one person and wounding four, sending the panicked crowd running. The enraged protesters later marched on the nearby FJP offices, where gunmen inside the compound shot at them, killing two more demonstrators, according to security officials who were speaking on condition <b>of</b> <b>anonymity</b> <b>because</b> they weren't authorized to talk to the press. The clashes later escalated with protesters fighting alongside security forces on one side and Morsi's supporters on the other. Another deadly confrontation occurred in Beni Suef where opponents of Mohamed Morsi torched the ruling FJP's offices earlier in the morning, hours before mass protests were about to take place in the province. Nasser Saad, the FJP's media spokesman in Beni Suef, said that several protesters threw Molotov cocktails at the building's balconies around two o'clock in the morning before moving to a secretariat office and torched it too. Later that day, one protester was killed and 30 were injured, according to Beni Suef's security chief, when unknown assailants fired at anti-Morsi protests in El-Modereya Square. Following the shooting, Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya claimed in a statement that the person killed {{was a member of the}} Islamist group while the office of Hamdeen Sabahi's Popular Current claimed that members of the [...] "jihadist movement" [...] in the city was the one behind the attack. The health ministry confirmed however that 25-year-old Ammar Gouda was the protester who died while participating in anti-Morsi protests. The army arrived to break up the situation and the demonstrations quietly continued later on. In Minya, around a hundred protesters gathered at Palace Square, chanting against Morsi and the Brotherhood while around five hundred lawyers, who started a march from the court's complex in Minya, also chanted against the regime. Muslim Brotherhood youth formed popular committees to protect the FJP headquarters. There were other violent clashes in the Faiyum Governorate in which hundreds of Morsi opponents clashed with his Islamist supporters outside the Muslim Brotherhood's local FJP office. Both sides were pelting sticks and stones at each other in the Al-Masala district and there were also unconfirmed reports of rubber bullets being used mutually by the clashing demonstrators.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Since 2003, US {{government}} funding {{to address the}} HIV and AIDS pandemic has been subject to an anti-prostitution clause. Simultaneously, the efficacy of some HIV prevention efforts for sex work in areas receiving US {{government funding}} has diminished. This article seeks to explain why. Methods: This analysis utilizes a case story approach to build a narrative of defining features of organizations in receipt of funding from the President&#x 0027;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and other US funding sources. For this analysis, multiple cases were compiled within a single narrative. This helps show restrictions imposed by the anti-prostitution clause, any lack of clarity of guidelines for implementation and ways some agencies, decision-making personnel, and staff on the ground contend with these restrictions. Results: Responses to PEPFAR&#x 0027;s anti-prostitution clause vary widely and have varied over time. Organizational responses have included ending services for sex workers, gradual phase-out of services, cessation of seeking US government HIV funds and increasing isolation of sex workers. Guidance issued in 2010 did not clarify what was permitted. Implementation and enforcement has been dependent {{in part on the}} interpretations of this policy by individuals, including US government representatives and organizational staff. Conclusions: Different interpretations of the anti-prostitution clause have led to variations in programming, affecting the effectiveness of work with sex workers. The case story approach proved ideal for working with information like this that is highly sensitive and vulnerable to breach <b>of</b> <b>anonymity</b> <b>because</b> the method limits the potential to betray confidences and sources, and limits the potential to jeopardize funding and thereby jeopardize programming. This method enabled us to use specific examples without jeopardizing the organizations and individuals involved while demonstrating unintended consequences of PEPFAR&#x 0027;s anti-prostitution pledge in its provision of services to sex workers and clients...|$|E

40|$|Anonymity, {{which is}} more and more {{important}} to multi-receiver schemes, has been taken into consideration by many researchers recently. To protect the receiver anonymity, in 2010, the first multi-receiver scheme based on the Lagrange interpolating polynomial was proposed. To ensure the sender's <b>anonymity,</b> the concept <b>of</b> the ring signature was proposed in 2005, but afterwards, this scheme was proven to has some weakness and at the same time, a completely anonymous multi-receiver signcryption scheme is proposed. In this completely anonymous scheme, the sender anonymity is achieved by improving the ring signature, and the receiver anonymity is achieved by also using the Lagrange interpolating polynomial. Unfortunately, the Lagrange interpolation method was proven a failure to protect the <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> receivers, <b>because</b> each authorized receiver could judge whether anyone else is authorized or not. Therefore, the completely anonymous multi-receiver signcryption mentioned above can only protect the sender anonymity. In this paper, we propose a new completely anonymous multi-receiver signcryption scheme with a new polynomial technology used to replace the Lagrange interpolating polynomial, which can mix the identity information of receivers to save it as a ciphertext element and prevent the authorized receivers from verifying others. With the receiver anonymity, the proposed scheme also owns the <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> the sender at the same time. Meanwhile, the decryption fairness and public verification are also provided...|$|R
