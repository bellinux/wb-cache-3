5|$|Construction of Central Park cost $186.5million, {{and upon}} {{completion}} the building overtook the R Tower (now the BankWest Tower) as the tallest skyscraper in Perth. It {{was also the}} city's largest <b>office</b> <b>tower</b> by combined floor area, a title which was taken by QV.1 when that building opened in 1994.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{construction}} of the modern <b>office</b> <b>tower</b> at the site's north-eastern corner required demolition of Terrace Arcade, the eastern accommodation wing and the hotel's renowned dining room. The rationale given for the works required was that extensive renovations to the Palace Hotel in 1915 and the 1930s had weakened its structure significantly, as well as problems controlling white ants in the structure.|$|E

5|$|The University of Washington showed {{interest}} in developing an <b>office</b> <b>tower</b> over the station box, whose development rights were acquired by the university in 2013. Neighborhood residents and activists, including former UW professor Phil Thiel, instead proposed a public plaza {{on top of the}} station, citing the dimensions being similar to those of central squares in European cities.|$|E
5|$|In the 1964 Government led by Harold Wilson, Benn was Postmaster General, {{where he}} oversaw {{the opening of}} the Post <b>Office</b> <b>Tower,</b> then the UK's tallest building, and the creations of the Post Bus service and Girobank. He {{proposed}} issuing stamps without the Sovereign's head, but this met with private opposition from the Queen.

5|$|The Clal Center {{enjoyed a}} high {{occupancy}} rate from government offices, businesses, and private companies until the mid-1980s. The construction of Malha Mall and government facilities at Givat Ram precipitated {{the exodus of}} many private and government firms in the 1990s, leaving entire floors of the <b>office</b> <b>tower</b> unoccupied. Stores on the commercial level also began closing {{due to lack of}} customers; as of 2010, many stores were being used as storerooms by Mahane Yehuda Market merchants.|$|E
5|$|The site {{occupied}} by the tower was home to the Palace Hotel, and organised opposition was formed {{to try to save}} that building from demolition to make way for an <b>office</b> <b>tower.</b> The site was subsequently acquired by businessman Alan Bond and the tower was approved and constructed in a plan that would retain much of the Palace Hotel. The tower then remained the headquarters of Bond's companies until their collapse. The tower has also been the headquarters of Western Australia's state bank, Bankwest (formerly known as the R Bank), between its completion and 2012.|$|E

5|$|In October 2011 {{city and}} state {{officials}} announced an agreement in which the UN {{would be allowed to}} build a long-sought new <b>office</b> <b>tower</b> adjacent to the existing campus on the current Robert Moses Playground, which would be relocated. In exchange, the United Nations would allow the construction of an esplanade along the East River that would complete the East River Greenway, a waterfront pedestrian and bicycle pathway. While host nation authorities have agreed to the provisions of the plan, it needs the approval of the United Nations in order to be implemented. The plan is similar in concept to an earlier proposal that had been announced in 2000 but did not move forward.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1986, the Huntington Development Corporation {{suggested}} that an off-track betting facility be constructed, however, the idea died after Governor Arch Moore vetoed an off-track betting bill that was critical to the project's success. In 1987, the Webb Companies presented {{a plan for a}} $110 million mixed-use complex called RiverCenter that would feature a 20-story <b>office</b> <b>tower,</b> an underground parking garage and a skyway to the Harris Riverfront Park. The project failed when two large tenants could not be found to anchor the project. In 1988, the city's grant to help develop the project was revoked.|$|E
5|$|Starting from George M. Ewing's {{original}} design of an <b>office</b> <b>tower,</b> Pietro Belluschi and George M. Ewing Co. turned the Rohm and Haas Corporate Headquarters into a , nine-story low horizontal block. At {{the corner of}} 6th Street and Market Street, two blocks away from Independence Hall, the Rohm and Haas Corporate Headquarters front facade runs parallel along 6th Street looking towards the Independence Mall. The reinforced concrete framed building sits on flaring concrete columns and is set back from the street by a raised plaza. The landscaped plaza cuts {{through the middle of}} the ground level of the building, opening up to a larger plaza with a fountain and small pool. The plaza behind the building allows public access to an alley that leads to Seventh Street.|$|E

5|$|The Deutsche Bank Building across Liberty Street {{from the}} World Trade Center complex was later {{condemned}} as uninhabitable because of toxic conditions inside the <b>office</b> <b>tower,</b> and was deconstructed. The Borough of Manhattan Community College's Fiterman Hall at 30 West Broadway was condemned due to extensive {{damage in the}} attacks, and is being rebuilt. Other neighboring buildings (including 90 West Street and the Verizon Building) suffered major damage but have been restored. World Financial Center buildings, One Liberty Plaza, the Millenium Hilton, and 90 Church Street had moderate damage and have since been restored. Communications equipment {{on top of the}} North Tower was also destroyed, but media stations were quickly able to reroute the signals and resume their broadcasts.|$|E
