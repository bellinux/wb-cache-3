50|$|Punk Radio Cast and Interpunk, {{the leading}} <b>online</b> <b>music</b> <b>distributor,</b> joined forces in 2004 {{to create an}} {{interactive}} voting show, The Interpunk Top 40, to support a striving fraction of the music industry. With {{the current state of}} the music media industry, it is almost impossible for independent and new artists to gain exposure. Interpunk has created an innovative way, through their site, to offer artist’s distribution whether or not they receive label support. Punk Radio Cast developed their website to not only allow the listeners to vote upon the Top 40 winner but to offer the listeners a link to the artist’s album on Interpunk. Each week artists are randomly selected by Punk Radio Cast staff members and listeners. It is not mandatory for selected artist to be available on Interpunk; instead it is used to promote two tools that any artist can access, Interpunk and Punk Radio Cast.|$|E
40|$|Electronic {{means for}} creation, release and {{distribution}} of music are covered by the Bachelor thesis, particularly from a starting author's point of view. Major modes to release electronic music are reviewed with a particular focus on internet operating <b>online</b> <b>music</b> <b>distributors</b> that link the authors with music e-shops. Dozens of online distributors are reviewed for the conditions and services they offer to starting authors. Based on the data acquired by an original research, the online distributors are evaluated and compared according to the total benefit the author can achieve. The marketing of both singles and albums is considered. A new concept of averaged album is introduced to cope with diversity of distributors. Several methods are proposed and used to evaluate and compare the author's profit. Calculations are performed using a fixed number {{as well as an}} expected number of units sold. An electronic music debutant may apply the recommendations derived in the thesis, consult the data tables and the charts included in the text or even run the presented methods on his or her own. Intellectual property rights are also discussed and several organizations protecting the rights of music authors are reviewed and evaluated from a starting author's point of view...|$|R
40|$|The music {{industry}} {{has experienced a}} major slump in sales of physical sound storage media such as the compact disc. Contrary to this, revenues gained in the <b>online</b> <b>music</b> sector doubled in 2006. In this growing industry digital standard formats and standard workflows in the electronic music distribution process could help companies to lower their costs and work more efficiently. This thesis provides a rough overview of the digital music distribution industry with a special focus on the business-to-business relationship between music aggregators and music download platforms. It aims to clarify whether standards regarding workflow, music data and music metadata exist. First, a review of literature is undertaken {{in order to gain}} knowledge about the social construction theory and actor network theory as well as facts and figures about the current digital {{music industry}}. Then five qualitative interviews are conducted with expert representatives of <b>music</b> aggregators and <b>online</b> <b>music</b> <b>distributors.</b> The interviews aim at identifying constraining closure mechanisms and uncovering details about the actors´ attitudes towards standardisation of workflows and data. The main outcome of the thesis {{is that there is a}} need for standardisation of music metadata, data processing and sales reporting procedures. The findings suggest that the most powerful actors in the music business, represented by the IFPI (International Federation of the Phonographic Industry), need to agree on international standards for the issues mentioned above. The findings also provide a list of starting points for further research and discussion about improvements in the digital music sector...|$|R
