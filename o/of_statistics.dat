5|$|The {{problem of}} {{induction}} discussed above {{is seen in}} another form in debates over the foundations <b>of</b> <b>statistics.</b> The standard approach to statistical hypothesis testing avoids claims about whether evidence supports a hypothesis or makes it more probable. Instead, the typical test yields a p-value, which is the probability of the evidence being such as it is, {{under the assumption that}} the hypothesis being tested is true. If the p-value is too low, the hypothesis is rejected, in a way analogous to falsification. In contrast, Bayesian inference seeks to assign probabilities to hypotheses. Related topics in philosophy <b>of</b> <b>statistics</b> include probability interpretations, overfitting, and the difference between correlation and causation.|$|E

The first chapter describes the derivation of the density and distribution function <b>of</b> order <b>statistics</b> in several ways as well as dealing with some functions <b>of</b> order <b>statistics</b> and their conditional distribution. The second chapter is devoted to the moments <b>of</b> order <b>statistics</b> and formulae for their calculation and to the relations between them.
