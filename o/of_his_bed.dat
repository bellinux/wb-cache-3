5|$|Galvis {{struggled}} off {{the field}} after his injury in 2012, noting that he only emerged from the covers <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>bed</b> to answer the door for takeout food, namely Chinese food, pizza, and cheesesteaks. Since then, he has started a daily therapeutic routine aimed at preventing future injuries, to which he is apparently susceptible after his first back injury. His hobbies include relaxing at the beach and playing basketball. Galvis married his wife, Anna, in 2013, and {{is the father of}} two girls named Anastasia and Nicole.|$|E
5|$|Passing {{from these}} {{historic}} examples {{we find the}} chair monopolized by the ruler, lay or ecclesiastical, to a comparatively late date. As the seat of authority it stood {{at the head of}} the lord’s table, on his dais, by the side <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>bed.</b> The seigneurial chair, more common in France and the Netherlands than in England, is a very interesting type, approximating in many respects to the episcopal or abbatial throne or stall. It early acquired a very high back and sometimes had a canopy. Arms were invariable, and the lower part was closed in with panelled or carved front and sides—the seat, indeed, was often hinged and sometimes closed with a key.|$|E

25|$|Ant {{saw little}} action during the {{remainder}} of the Phoney War, but adopted Bozděch as his master, sleeping at the foot <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>bed</b> in barracks. With the end of the Phoney War on 10 May 1940, the airfield at Saint-Dizier was bombed by a wing of German Dornier Do 17s, while Bozděch and Ant were huddled in a bunker. The attack destroyed all but fourteen of the planes at the base, and following this the local forces began their retreat. After moving to their third base, Bozděch took the decision to take Ant with him in the Potez 630 for the dog's first combat mission. Ant barely stirred, even when Bozděch was firing the guns at German fighters. The duo were reunited with a recovered Duval, who became Bozděch's pilot once again, while Ant continued to fly with them.|$|E
25|$|In September 1909, Erhardt {{was staying}} at the Union League Club while his wife, Nora Belle Jewett, was visiting their {{daughter}} at York Harbor, Maine {{for part of the}} summer. He had told his private secretary that he had not been feeling well, believing he may have developed rheumatism, and his friends at the club noticed that he had been in ill health during the last month but appeared well while staying at the club. On the morning of September 7, at about 1:00a.m., the club watchman was passing Erhardt's room and saw him sitting at the side <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>bed.</b> Erhardt told them to get a doctor at once. His family physician, Dr. John Solley, was called from his home on West Fifty-Eighth Street but Erhardt died at 1.20a.m. At the time of his death, he was the president of the Lawyers' Surety Company and a director in a number of corporations.|$|E
50|$|Cremorne was a {{difficult}} horse to train, owing to his extreme laziness: {{he was known to}} fall asleep during breaks in exercise. He also had an apparently insatiable appetite and would eat anything edible within his range.

In short, he was the wealthiest prince of the Church <b>of</b> <b>his</b> day, and he lived with a magnificence worthy of a king or of the Pope himself.|$|R

He answered my few words by a comparatively long, connected speech. He asserted himself strongly. If he escaped being smothered by this stagnant heat, he said, he was confident that in a very few days {{he would be able to}} come up on deck and help me.|$|R

500|$|Following the England tour, the Australians {{returned}} home via a tour to the Indian subcontinent. The first stop was Karachi, where Australia played its first ever Test against Pakistan. Lindwall's poor run continued, scoring {{two and a}} duck and taking match figures of 1/64 as Australia fell to a nine wicket defeat. The team travelled to Madras {{for the first of}} three Tests in India. Lindwall briefly bowled on the first morning without success before succumbing to a severe stomach bug. He took no further part in the first innings and spent the next two days in bed. Lindwall briefly got out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>bed</b> on day three to bat, making only eight as Australia took a 158 run first innings lead. He hauled himself out of bed on the fourth day, and cut through the Indians in three spells, taking 7/43 in an innings victory.|$|E
500|$|While playing {{shows in}} England in 1969, the band {{discovered}} {{they were being}} mistaken for another English group named Earth. They decided to change their name again. A cinema {{across the street from}} the band's rehearsal room was showing the 1963 horror film Black Sabbath starring Boris Karloff and directed by Mario Bava. While watching people line up to see the film, Butler noted that it was [...] "strange that people spend so much money to see scary movies." [...] Following that, Osbourne and Butler wrote the lyrics for a song called [...] "Black Sabbath", which was inspired by the work of horror and adventure-story writer Dennis Wheatley, along with a vision that Butler had of a black silhouetted figure standing at the foot <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>bed.</b> Making use of the musical tritone, also known as [...] "the Devil's Interval", the song's ominous sound and dark lyrics pushed the band in a darker direction, a stark contrast to the popular music of the late 1960s, which was dominated by flower power, folk music, and hippie culture. Judas Priest frontman Rob Halford has called the track [...] "probably the most evil song ever written". Inspired by the new sound, the band changed their name to Black Sabbath in August 1969, and made the decision to focus on writing similar material, in an attempt to create the musical equivalent of horror films.|$|E

500|$|Viggo Johansen (1851–1935), who {{had studied}} at the Royal Academy with Michael Ancher (also without graduating), first went to Skagen in 1875. An {{active member of the}} group, he married Anna Ancher's cousin Martha Møller in 1880. From 1885, he {{exhibited}} in Paris where he was inspired by Claude Monet. His paintings took on lighter tones as he had noted the absence of black in the works of the French artists and considered his own earlier works too dark by comparison. Monet's use of colour is reflected in his painting [...] (1890). The work displays stronger contrasts than his earlier paintings, depicting the red-bearded Christian looking out towards the light at the foot <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>bed</b> where the flaming gold and white sunlight streams down onto the little blue cupboard on the wall. Among the works he painted in Skagen are [...] (1884) which depicts his wife Martha arranging flowers, and the much brighter [...] (1885) showing four fishermen who have pulled their boat up onto the beach while one of their wives hopes there will be something for the evening meal. After falling out with P.S. Krøyer in 1891, Johansen's relationship with the Anchers was strained and he and his family did not visit Skagen for several years but finally returned in 1903. In 1906, he became a professor at the Royal Academy where he was director from 1911 to 1914.|$|E
500|$|Kelly and Darryl’s {{continuing}} relationship {{proves to}} be dysfunctional, as she cannot comprehend his candor, and he finds her to be attractive yet [...] "crazy." [...] Creed Bratton (played by the real-life Creed Bratton) advises Michael to declare bankruptcy, which Michael does literally by walking {{into the office and}} shouting [...] "I declare bankruptcy!", thinking this was all he needed to do. Upon reviewing Michael's financial situation, Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) finds that Michael spends a large amount on useless items like magic kits and bass fishing equipment. Meanwhile, Jim and Pam feel sorry for Dwight and attempt to cheer him up by posting a positive review <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>bed</b> & breakfast on TripAdvisor.com, which pleases him. [...] However, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) gains Angela's approval to ask her out on a date by giving her the cat (named Garbage) that Dwight had tried to give Angela earlier, sending Dwight spiraling into crushing depression. Dwight retreats to the stairwell to moan. Jim joins him and recounts his days pining for Pam and how miserable it made him feel, saying he would not wish it on his worst enemy, Dwight included, to experience it, and Dwight realizes that he is not without friends. Having re-opened his old memories, Jim re-enters the office, goes right to Pam and kisses her passionately, and indirectly confesses {{in an interview that he}} loves her. Jim is quietly pleased when Dwight returns to his desk along with his annoying and overbearing personality. Jan learns of Michael's dismal finances by phone, and immediately harangues Michael about being irresponsible. [...] He panics and attempts to hop a nearby train. [...] However, the train is slowing down and comes to a complete halt, upon which he is seen sitting on the train singing to himself. Jan speeds to the office and Oscar tells her in which direction Michael ran. She then runs to the train yard. She tells him that she will stand by him as he did when she was fired. Eventually, they leave the train yard hand in hand.|$|E

2500|$|In late 1967, Geezer Butler formed {{his first}} band, Rare Breed, and soon {{recruited}} Osbourne {{to serve as}} vocalist. The band played two shows, then broke up. Osbourne and Butler reunited in Polka Tulk Blues, along with guitarist Tony Iommi and drummer Bill Ward, whose band Mythology had recently broken up. They renamed themselves Earth, but after being accidentally booked for a show instead of a different band with the same name, they decided to change their name again. They finally settled on the name Black Sabbath in August 1969, based on the film of the same name. The band had noticed how people enjoyed being frightened; inspired, the band decided to play a heavy blues style of music laced with gloomy sounds and lyrics. While recording their first album, Butler read an occult book and woke up to a dark figure at the end <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>bed.</b> Butler told Osbourne about it and together they wrote the lyrics to [...] "Black Sabbath", their first song in a darker vein.|$|E
2500|$|His last public {{statement}} was dictated {{to his daughter}} Helen in reply to receiving the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford's [...] "sorrow and affection": [...] "There is no expression of Christian sympathy that I value more {{than that of the}} ancient University of Oxford, the God-fearing and God-sustaining University of Oxford. I served her perhaps mistakenly, but {{to the best of my}} ability. [...] My most earnest prayers are hers to the uttermost and to the last". He left the house for the last time on 9 April. After 18 April he did not come down to the ground floor but still came out of bed to lie on the sofa. [...] The Bishop of St Andrews, Dunkeld and Dunblane George Wilkinson recorded when he ministered to him along with Stephen Gladstone: Shall I ever forget the last Friday in Passion Week, when I gave him the last Holy Communion that I was allowed to administer to him? It was early in the morning. He was obliged to be in bed, and he was ordered to remain there, but the time had come for the confession of sin and the receiving of absolution.
