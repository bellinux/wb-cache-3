5|$|Another {{possible}} {{indicator of}} Chnodomar's numbers is size of forces considered necessary by the Roman government {{to deal with}} the Alamanni threat in Gaul: 40,000 (Julian's 15,000 plus Barbatio's 25,000). Assuming that the Roman military planners would have sought a 2 to 1 superiority to guarantee success, that would imply an Alamannic strength in Alsace of about 20,000. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> indicators, the midpoint between the recent estimate and Ammianus' figure, 25,000, would seem plausible.|$|E

At the parliament the next month, Edward made a range of concessions to placate those opposed to Gaveston, including agreeing to limit {{the powers of the}} royal steward and the marshal of the royal household, to regulate the Crown's unpopular powers of purveyance and to abandon recently enacted customs legislation; in return, the parliament agreed to fresh taxes for the war in Scotland. Temporarily, at least, Edward and the barons appeared to have come to a successful compromise.|$|E

5|$|Four {{different}} types of male flowers exist. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> flower types, the genus has often been split into four genera—a more narrowly defined Attalea, Orbignya, Maximiliana and Scheelea. The species sometimes referred to Orbignya have coiled anthers, while the other groups have straight ones. The petals of those placed in Maximiliana are much shorter than the stamens, while those placed in Scheelea and a more narrowly defined Attalea have petals that are longer than the stamens.

5|$|In a 2009 {{revision}} of the Oryzomys of western Mexico, M.D. Carleton and J.

5|$|All {{of these}} cerebellum-like {{structures}} {{appear to be}} primarily sensory-related rather than motor-related. All of them have granule cells {{that give rise to}} parallel fibers that connect to Purkinje-like neurons with modifiable synapses, but none have climbing fibers comparable to those of the cerebellum—instead they receive direct input from peripheral sensory organs. None has a demonstrated function, but the most influential speculation is that they serve to transform sensory inputs in some sophisticated way, perhaps to compensate for changes in body posture. In fact, James M. Bower and others have argued, partly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> structures and partly on the basis of cerebellar studies, that the cerebellum itself is fundamentally a sensory structure, and that it contributes to motor control by moving the body in a way that controls the resulting sensory signals. Despite Bower's viewpoint, there is also strong evidence that the cerebellum directly influences motor output in mammals.|$|E

Casualties in the British convoy had been heavy, Windham losing six killed and 18 wounded, Ceylon six killed and 21 wounded (including Meriton and Oldham) and Astell eight killed and 37 wounded (including Hay). In all, 20 British sailors and soldiers were killed and 76 wounded during the engagement, a figure which was matched by the French losses of 22 killed and 38 wounded: four killed and six wounded on Bellone, 17 killed and 29 wounded on Minerve and one killed and three wounded on Victor. The prizes were very severely damaged and Duperré was forced to take his squadron to an isolated beach on Anjouan until 17 July to effect repairs, before returning to Île de France.

5|$|Hitler {{decided that}} the summer 1942 {{campaign}} would be concentrated in the south; efforts would be made to capture the oilfields in the Caucasus. The Battle of Stalingrad, a major turning point of the war, began on 23 August 1942 with a bombing campaign by the Luftwaffe. The Sixth Army entered the city, but because of its location on the front line, it was still possible for the Soviets to encircle and trap it there without reinforcements or supplies. When the Sixth Army was surrounded {{by the end of}} November in Operation Uranus, Göring promised that the Luftwaffe would be able to deliver a minimum of 300 tons of supplies to the trapped men every day. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> assurances, Hitler demanded that there be no retreat; they were to fight to the last man. Though some airlifts were able to get through, the amount of supplies delivered never exceeded 120 tons per day. The remnants of the German Sixth Army—some 91,000 men out of an army of 285,000—surrendered in early February 1943; only 5,000 of these captives survived the Russian prisoner of war camps to see Germany again.|$|E
5|$|Much of the sunnah is {{recorded}} in the Hadith. Initially, Muhammad had instructed his followers not to write down his acts, so they may not confuse it with the Qur'an. However, he did ask his followers to disseminate his sayings orally. As {{long as he was}} alive, any doubtful record could be confirmed as true or false by simply asking him. His death, however, gave rise to confusion over Muhammad's conduct. Thus the Hadith were established. Due to problems of authenticity, the science of Hadith (Arabic: `Ulum al-hadith) is established. It is a method of textual criticism developed by early Muslim scholars in determining the veracity of reports attributed to Muhammad. This is achieved by analyzing the text of the report, the scale of the report's transmission, the routes through which the report was transmitted, and the individual narrators involved in its transmission. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> criteria, various Hadith classifications developed.|$|E

5|$|Pennant's next publication, in 1774, was {{his account}} of the second journey to Scotland. This was in two volumes with the second {{appearing}} in 1776. These works include so much detail of the countryside, its economy, natural history and the customs of the inhabitants that they are still of interest today by way of comparison with the very different state of things now. While these volumes were in preparation, he started some new projects. In 1773 he returned to Cumberland, Westmorland and Yorkshire to visit the parts of them that he had missed previously. As with all his tours, he travelled on horseback, keeping his daily journal and accompanied by Moses Griffith who made copious sketches on the way. Pennant seems to have been an unpretentious man of simple tastes, who was welcomed into the homes of strangers wherever he went. He also made tours in Northamptonshire and the Isle of Man. Whenever he travelled to London he took a slightly different route, again recording what he saw and did and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> details, some years later he wrote his Journey from Chester to London.

5|$|The Lesser Antillean macaw or Guadeloupe macaw (Ara guadeloupensis) is a {{hypothetical}} extinct species of macaw that {{is thought to}} have been endemic to the Lesser Antillean island region of Guadeloupe. In spite of the absence of conserved specimens, many details about the Lesser Antillean macaw are known from several contemporary accounts, and the bird is the subject of some illustrations. Austin Hobart Clark described the species <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> accounts in 1905. Due to the lack of physical remains, and the possibility that sightings were of macaws from the South American mainland, doubts have been raised about the existence of this species. A phalanx bone from the island of Marie-Galante confirmed the existence of a similar-sized macaw inhabiting the region prior to the arrival of humans, and was correlated with the Lesser Antillean macaw in 2015. Later that year, historical sources distinguishing between the red macaws of Guadeloupe and the scarlet macaw (A. macao) of the mainland were identified, further supporting its validity.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Aesthetics {{paradox is}} one of the ways of defamiliarization and {{creating}} language aesthetics and is not related to concepts, but it contains vocables which contradict somehow (Vahidian, 1376 : 284). In aesthetic paradox, the poets can convey themselves in a simple way, for example, instead of "Atash dar Atash Zadan", "Nabood Kardan Atash", "Azad bodan Asiir" "Azad bodan Asheg”, “Tagreebe jodaiee”, “fararesidan jodaiee" and "jameh Parishan" instead of "gorohe parishan". They often conveyed this through paradox to stimulate the readers. By this the reader tries to get the fact beyond this. The reader tries to enjoy from discovering this fact and store that in his mind. The paradox can be divided into two parts structurely 1 -     Exional e. g: Bikhabar Ra Saheebe Khabar Danestan", "Bishee Rar Dar Kamii Danestan" 2 -     Syntactical e. g. : "Rahee BiRahii", "Zabane Bizabanie”   1. Paradox through exion: Sometimes paradox in the concept of one verse or one half verse {{is in the form of}} exions. Such images, in comparison to syntactic paradox has more artistic value. Most aesthetics paradoxes in Persian Literature are exional. Exional paradox is divided into seven kinds. 1. 1.            <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> Metaphor 1. 2.            <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> simile / Analogy 1. 3.            <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> kenning 1. 4.            <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> allegory 1. 5.            <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> two- sided images 1. 6.            <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> ambiguity 1. 7.            <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> Rhetoric These rhetorical and figurative language practices are inherently beautiful but when they are conveyed through paradox, their effects are increased several times.   1. 1. <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> Metaphor In this type of contradiction, view of aesthetics mosta’ar is chosen to be in contradiction with a word in poetry and by eliminating moshabah-on-beh, contradiction is clear: (Given example – Hafeez 1835 : 192) 1. 2. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> simile: In this type of contradictory view such vehicle is chosen to be in contradiction with the word poetry and with the removal of this vehicle, contradiction is clear. (Given example- Khaganie, 1367 : 699).   2. Paradox in the form of syntactic In this rhetorical art two sides of one coin of a combination violate each other in terms of the concept (Shaffiee- 1370 : 37 for example aabe khoshk, atashe abdar, …. In these combinations, there are paradox and contradiction in term of concepts. Although such contradictions are fault in the Logic, they are excellent in Persian Literature. This type of application is frequent. Synthetic paradoxes are also seven kinds. 2. 1. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> Metaphor 2. 2. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> simile / Analogy 2. 3. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> kenning 2. 4. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> allegory 2. 5. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> two- sided images 2. 6. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> ambiguity 2. 7. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> Rhetoric   2. 1. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> Allegory Here it is allowed to put the synonymous instead of a word.

For e. g. jogdea Homayon (Saee 1375, first vol. 258)   2. 2. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> two- sided images In this exponential contradictory of aesthetic, these vehicles are chosen in the way that they create paradox in poetry and by eliminating them, this contradiction is clear (Given example, Khaganii, 1367 : 368) ...|$|R
