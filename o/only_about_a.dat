5|$|Cheddar is {{recognised}} as a village. The adjacent {{settlement of}} Axbridge, although <b>only</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> third {{the population of}} Cheddar, is a town. This apparently illogical situation is explained by {{the relative importance of}} the two places in historic times. While Axbridge grew in importance as a centre for cloth manufacturing in the Tudor period and gained a charter from King John, Cheddar remained a more dispersed mining and dairy-farming village. Its population grew {{with the arrival of the}} railways in the Victorian era and the advent of tourism.|$|E

5|$|Lead has no {{confirmed}} biological role. Its prevalence in {{the human}} body—at an adult average of 120mg—is nevertheless exceeded only by zinc (2500mg) and iron (4000mg) among the heavy metals. Lead salts are very efficiently absorbed by the body. A small amount of lead (1%) is stored in bones; the rest is excreted in urine and feces {{within a few weeks}} of exposure. <b>Only</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> third of lead is excreted by a child.

5|$|More {{than half}} of the delegates had trained as lawyers (several had even been judges), {{although}} <b>only</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> quarter had practiced law as their principal means of business. There were also merchants, manufacturers, shippers, land speculators, bankers or financiers, two or three physicians, a minister, and several small farmers. Of the twenty-five who owned slaves, sixteen depended on slave labor to run the plantations or other businesses that formed the mainstay of their income. Most of the delegates were landowners with substantial holdings, and most, {{with the possible exception of}} Roger Sherman and William Few, were very comfortably wealthy. George Washington and Robert Morris were among the wealthiest men in the entire country.|$|E
5|$|Overall, Europeans formed <b>only</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> {{tenth of}} the royalist armies in Spanish America, and {{only about half of}} the expeditionary units, once they were {{deployed}} in the Americas. Since each European soldier casualty was replaced by a Spanish American soldier, over time, there were more and more Spanish American soldiers in the expeditionary units. For example, Pablo Morillo, {{commander in chief of the}} expeditionary force sent to South America, reported that he had only 2,000 European soldiers under his command in 1820; in other words, only half the soldiers of his expeditionary force were European. It is estimated that in the Battle of Maipú only a quarter of the royalist forces were European soldiers, in the Battle of Carabobo about a fifth, and in the Battle of Ayacucho less than 1% was European.|$|E

5|$|Vega is <b>only</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> {{tenth of}} the age of the Sun, but since it is 2.1 times as massive its {{expected}} lifetime is also one tenth of that of the Sun; both stars are at present approaching the midpoint of their life expectancies. Vega has an unusually low abundance of the elements with a higher atomic number than that of helium. Vega is also a variable star that varies slightly in brightness. It is rotating rapidly with a velocity of 274km/s at the equator. This causes the equator to bulge outward due to centrifugal effects, and, as a result, there is a variation of temperature across the star's photosphere that reaches a maximum at the poles. From Earth, Vega is observed from the direction of one of these poles.|$|E
5|$|Although the Annapolis Convention saw <b>only</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> dozen delegates attend, {{representing}} {{only five}} states, {{it called for}} a meeting {{to be held in}} Philadelphia in May 1787, to devise amendments to the Articles of Confederation which would result in a more durable constitutional arrangement. Accordingly, in December 1786, the Virginia General Assembly elected seven men as the commonwealth's delegation: Washington, Mason, Henry, Randolph, Madison, Wythe, and John Blair. Henry declined appointment, and his place was given to Dr. James McClurg. Randolph, who had just been elected governor, sent three notifications of election to Mason, who accepted without any quibbles. The roads were difficult because of spring flooding, and Mason was the last Virginia delegate to arrive, on May 17, three days after the convention's scheduled opening. But it was not until May 25 that the convention formally opened, with the arrival of at least one delegate from ten of the twelve states which sent representatives (Rhode Island sent no one).|$|E

5|$|At the 2001 UK census, {{there were}} 1,805,315 {{residents}} of Greater Manchester aged 16 to 74. The economic activity {{of these people}} was 40.3% in full-time employment, 11.3% in part-time employment, 6.7% self-employed, 3.5% unemployed, 5.1% students without jobs, 2.6% students with jobs, 13.0% retired, 6.1% looking after home or family, 7.8% permanently sick or disabled and 3.5% economically inactive for other reasons. The figures follow the national trend, although the percentage of self-employed people is {{below the national average}} of 8.3%. The proportion of unemployment in the county varies, with the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport having the lowest at 2.0% and Manchester the highest at 7.9%. In 2001, of the 1,093,385residents of Greater Manchester in employment, the industry of employment was: 18.4% retail and wholesale; 16.7% manufacturing; 11.8% property and business services; 11.6% health and social work; 8.0% education; 7.3% transport and communications; 6.7% construction; 4.9% public administration and defence; 4.7% hotels and restaurants; 4.1% finance; 0.8% electricity, gas, and water supply; 0.5% agriculture; and 4.5% other. This was roughly in line with national figures, except for the proportion of jobs in agriculture which is <b>only</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> third of the national average of 1.5%, due to the overwhelmingly urban, built-up land use of Greater Manchester.|$|E

These numbers were significantly reduced as civilians fled the fighting. It is estimated that <b>only</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> third of the population remained in the city by the end of November, with some sources placing the estimate even lower, suggesting that the population of the city was reduced to just 10,000 civilians during the most intense periods of the bombardment.
