5|$|Pope Paul III and His Grandsons {{ranks as}} one of Titian's finest and most {{penetrating}} works. Although unfinished and less technically accomplished than his Portrait of Pope Paul III <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> earlier, it is renowned for its rich colouring; the deep reds of the tablecloth and the almost spectral whites of Paul's gown. The panel contains subtle indications of the contradictions in the character of the Pope, and captures the complex psychological dynamic between the three men.|$|E
5|$|Agricola's successors {{were unable}} or unwilling to further subdue the far north. The {{fortress}} at Inchtuthil was dismantled before its completion, and the other fortifications of the Gask Ridge were abandoned within the space <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years.</b> By CE 87 the occupation was limited to the Southern Uplands, {{and by the end of}} the first century the northern limit of Roman expansion was a line drawn between the Tyne and Solway Firth. Elginhaugh fort, in Midlothian, dates to about this period, as may Castle Greg in West Lothian. The Romans eventually withdrew to a line in what is now northern England, building the fortification known as Hadrian's Wall from coast to coast.|$|E

5|$|By 1911 Germany {{had built}} battlecruisers of her own, and {{the superiority of}} the British ships could no longer be assured. Moreover, the German Navy did not share Fisher's view of the battlecruiser. In {{contrast}} to the British focus on increasing speed and firepower, Germany progressively improved the armour and staying power of their ships to better the British battlecruisers. Von der Tann, begun in 1908 and completed in 1910, carried eight 11.1-inch guns, but with 11.1-inch (283mm) armour she was far better protected than the Invincibles. The two s were quite similar but carried ten 11.1-inch guns of an improved design. , designed in 1909 and finished in 1913, was a modified Moltke; speed increased by one knot to , while her armour had a maximum thickness of 12 inches, equivalent to the s <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> earlier. Seydlitz was Germany's last battlecruiser completed before World War I.|$|E
5|$|By 1978 {{the initial}} {{excavation}} work had uncovered {{a complete and}} coherent site with an intact ship structure and {{the orientation of the}} hull had been positively identified as being on an almost straight northerly heading with a 60-degree heel to starboard and a slight downward tilt towards the bow. As no records of English shipbuilding techniques used in vessels like the Mary Rose survive, excavation of the ship would allow for a detailed survey of her design and shed new light on the construction of ships of the era. A full excavation also meant removing the protective layers of silt that prevented the remaining ship structure from being destroyed through biological decay and the scouring of the currents; the operation had to be completed within a predetermined timespan <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> or it risked irreversible damage. It was also considered desirable to recover and preserve the remains of the hull if possible. For the first time, the project was faced with the practical difficulties of actually raising, conserving and preparing the hull for public display.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, the {{residents}} of Romney set about repairing public buildings and reestablishing the town's antebellum institutions, including the Romney Literary Society. The society remained on a hiatus until May 15, 1869 when a meeting was held by nine members, as only nine original members had responded to the call for reorganization. These nine members tasked with rebuilding the society were James L. Armstrong, David Entler, William Harper, John C. Heiskell, Andrew Wodrow Kercheval, Samuel R. Lupton, James Parsons, Alfred P. White, and Robert White. These men sought to collect {{what remained of the}} library's books and engaged in a campaign to recruit new members, which resulted in the enrollment of 20 younger men over a period <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years.</b> Many of the men who had been members in 1861 had died during the war, and the recruitment of new members was essential to the revival of the society. Among the new members elected between 1869 and 1886 were John Collins Covell, Samuel Lightfoot Flournoy, Henry Bell Gilkeson, Howard Hille Johnson, and Christian Streit White. The society, with renewed vigor, took a lead role in Romney's civil development during the Reconstruction Era.|$|E

5|$|Manager Bill Nicholson and his {{assistant}} Eddie Baily then began a period of transition at White Hart Lane– key players such as Danny Blanchflower, John White and Dave Mackay would all leave the club within the space <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> {{and had to be}} replaced. Greaves remained a consistent goalscorer though, and in the 1963–64 season he scored hat-tricks in victories over Nottingham Forest, Blackpool, Birmingham City and Blackburn Rovers. Spurs finished in fourth place, six points behind champions Liverpool, and exited the FA Cup and Cup Winners' Cup at the opening stages. Greaves scored 35 goals in 41 league games to again finish as the division's top scorer. Strike partner Bobby Smith left the club in the summer, though Greaves felt the partnership he went on to form with new signing Alan Gilzean was even more effective.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} {{announcement}} of victory, Agricola was recalled to Rome by Domitian and his post passed to Sallustius Lucullus. Agricola's successors were seemingly {{unable or unwilling}} to further subdue the far north. Despite his apparent successes, Agricola himself fell out of favour and it is possible that Domitian may have been informed of the fraudulence of his claims to have won a significant victory. The fortress at Inchtuthil was dismantled before its completion and the other fortifications of the Gask Ridge (erected to consolidate the Roman presence in Scotland in the aftermath of Mons Graupius) were abandoned within the space <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years.</b> It is possible that the costs of a drawn-out war outweighed any economic or political benefit and it was deemed more profitable to leave the Caledonians to themselves. By 87 the occupation was limited to the Southern Uplands {{and by the end of}} the 1st century the northern limit of Roman expansion was a line drawn between the Tyne and Solway Firth. Elginhaugh fort, in Midlothian, dates to about this period as may Castle Greg in West Lothian, which was most likely used as a monitoring base for an east-west road running along the foot of the nearby Pentlands, from the Forth to the Clyde Valley.|$|E
5|$|The Norwegian–British–Swedish Antarctic Expedition of 1949–52 was {{the first}} {{international}} scientific expedition in Antarctica. The expedition established its winter quarters at a base called Maudheim at 71°S, 11°W, and mapped much of western Queen Maud Land. During the International Geophysical Year (1957–1958), year-round stations were established in Queen Maud Land by Norway, the Soviet Union, Belgium and Japan. The Norwegian expedition continued with topographical mapping, while the others started geophysical and geological research. Norway's Norway Station was lent to South Africa following {{the withdrawal of the}} Norwegian expedition in 1960. South Africa later built the SANAE station, near the now-defunct Norway Station. The Soviet Union, and later Russia, has maintained continual operations, although it moved from Lazarev Station to Novolazarevskaya Station. Japan has been based at its Showa Station since 1957, except for a hiatus <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years.</b> Belgium closed its Roi Baudouin station in 1961, though it mounted limited operations in cooperation with the Netherlands in 1964–66. The United States established the temporary Plateau Station in 1966.|$|E
