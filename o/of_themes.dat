Two threads that run through a sizeable proportion of his books are Australia and cricket; the latter was also a lifelong passion.|$|E

40|$|Theme {{restaurant}} {{first appeared}} in the western countries in the 1980 s. Theme restaurants are different from the common restaurants. The common restaurants focus on the colour, flavour, and taste of the food and drink. However, the services and dining atmosphere which centre on certain theme are more important for the theme restaurant. Thus, customer experience plays a more important role in the brand equity <b>of</b> <b>theme</b> restaurant. Therefore, this dissertation plans to study the impact of customer experience on brand equity <b>of</b> <b>theme</b> restaurant and the specific objectives are: to analyse the impact of sensory experience on service brand equity <b>of</b> <b>theme</b> restaurants; to analyse the impact of emotional experience on service brand equity <b>of</b> <b>theme</b> restaurants; and to analyse the impact of social experience on service brand equity <b>of</b> <b>theme</b> restaurants. Centring on the research objectives, this dissertation uses questionnaire survey to collect quantitative data and then utilises frequency analysis, mean analysis, correlation analysis, and regression analysis to analyse the collected in order to identify the impact of customer experience on brand equity <b>of</b> <b>theme</b> restaurant in. After analysis, this dissertation finds that sensory experience, emotional experience, and social experience all have positive impact on brand equity <b>of</b> <b>theme</b> restaurant. Based on the findings, the final conclusions are obtained: customer experience has positive impact on brand equity of Tropical Forest Restaurant, Japanese Housemaid Restaurant, and Hero Village Restaurant. The more abundant and pleasant the customer experience is, the more valuable the brand equity <b>of</b> the <b>theme</b> restaurants is. Specifically, emotional experience, as the speciality <b>of</b> <b>theme</b> restaurants, plays the most significant role in improving brand equity. Meanwhile, the sensory experience, as the basic element <b>of</b> <b>theme</b> restaurants, plays a necessary role in improving brand equity. Besides, the social experience also {{plays an important role in}} improving brand equity <b>of</b> <b>theme</b> restaurants...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This {{research}} aims {{to investigate}} the thematic structures in students’ research papers and oral presentations. Specifically, it focuses on two aspects, i. e. types <b>of</b> <b>Theme</b> and realizations <b>of</b> topical <b>Theme</b> in students’ research papers and oral presentations. It is qualitative in nature, and involves three students’ research papers and transcribed students’ oral presentations as the main research data.

5|$|During {{the early}} 1970s, {{professional}} historians began to reevaluate the force's history. A wider set <b>of</b> <b>themes,</b> including social, {{race and class}} issues, began to be analysed, resulting in more challenging histories of the force being published. Legal challenges brought before the Canadian courts in the 1980s resulted in the release of archive material about the force's role in the First World War for the first time, generating further new lines of research.|$|E

5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in August 1973 following the tour supporting the previous album, Foxtrot (1972).

5|$|Although Etty had {{traditionally}} {{worked in}} the Venetian style of painting, with rich colours and detail, for Musidora he adopted a much softer and earthier palette, although his use of reflected light on flesh is derived from Venetian styles. He moved away from Rubens, who up to this time had been his greatest influence, {{and closer to the}} style of Titian. This is likely owing {{to the nature of the}} subject matter. Until then his history paintings had primarily been <b>of</b> <b>themes</b> of classical mythology, and took place in brightly lit Mediterranean settings. The Seasons, by contrast, was seen as an explicitly English work, requiring a more muted palette to deal with the typical lighting conditions of Yorkshire.|$|E

When its ascendance reaches its highest pitch, it is replaced by Theme I (a tempo), which is followed by Theme II again (Più mosso). A revolver shot (or a tam-tam stroke) in bar 195 marks the climax of the piece: at this point a real hysteria occurs. It means the victory <b>of</b> <b>Theme</b> II and is followed by a mangled version <b>of</b> <b>Theme</b> I (Allegro moderato).

5|$|Consequently, {{the empire}} became divided in a {{struggle}} that was less a rebellion against the established government and more a contest for the throne between equal contenders. Michael held Constantinople and the European provinces, controlled the imperial bureaucracy, and had been properly crowned by the Patriarch, but {{he had come to}} the throne through murder, while Thomas gained support and legitimacy through his claim to avenge the fallen Leo, and he won the backing <b>of</b> <b>themes</b> both in Asia and later in Europe. Thomas was a well-known, popular, and respected figure in Asia Minor, where Leo V had enjoyed considerable support. Michael, on the other hand, was virtually unknown outside the capital; his military record was unremarkable, he was uneducated and coarse of manner, his stutter earned him ridicule, and he was reputed to sympathize with the heretical religious sect of the Athinganoi, to which his family had belonged.|$|E

Hoysala artists are noted for their attention to sculptural detail be it in the depiction <b>of</b> <b>themes</b> from the Hindu epics and deities or in their use of motifs such as yalli, kirtimukha (gargoyles), aedicula (miniature decorative towers) on pilaster, makara (aquatic monster), birds (hamsa), spiral foliage, animals such as lions, elephants and horses, and even general aspects of daily life such as hair styles in vogue.|$|E

5|$|In the Byzantine state, {{the emperor}} {{was the sole}} and {{absolute}} ruler, and his power was regarded as having divine origin. The Senate had ceased to have real political and legislative authority but remained as an honorary council with titular members. By {{the end of the}} 8th century, a civil administration focused on the court was formed as part of a large-scale consolidation of power in the capital (the rise to pre-eminence of the position of sakellarios is related to this change). The most important administrative reform, which probably started in the mid-7th century, was the creation <b>of</b> <b>themes,</b> where civil and military administration was exercised by one person, the strategos.|$|E
5|$|Miyazaki's {{works are}} {{characterized}} by the recurrence <b>of</b> <b>themes</b> such as humanity's relationship with nature and technology, the wholesomeness of natural and traditional patterns of living, the importance of art and craftsmanship, {{and the difficulty of}} maintaining a pacifist ethic in a violent world. The protagonists of his films are often strong girls or young women, and several of his films present morally ambiguous antagonists with redeeming qualities. Miyazaki's works have been highly praised and awarded; he was named a Person of Cultural Merit for outstanding cultural contributions in November 2012, and received the Academy Honorary Award for his impact on animation and cinema in November 2014. In 2002, American film critic Roger Ebert suggested that Miyazaki may be the best animation filmmaker in history, praising the depth and artistry of his films.|$|E

5|$|Sonic Adventure 2 is a 3D {{game with}} six playable {{character}}s, {{divided into two}} campaigns: Hero (with Sonic, Tails and Knuckles the Echidna, where the player battles to save the world) and Dark (with Shadow the Hedgehog, Doctor Eggman and Rouge the Bat, where they battle to conquer it). Each character on each side has a playing style similar to the other characters on the side. The player moves through the Hero and Dark campaigns, switching between them at will. Each campaign cycles through levels of its three characters, telling different sides of the story. Levels have a variety <b>of</b> <b>themes</b> (such as cities, jungles, desert pyramids and outer space), with some followed by boss fights. The two campaigns' stories occur in parallel; completing both campaigns unlocks a Last Story with all six characters, culminating in a final boss fight.|$|E
5|$|There is {{reliance}} on repetition <b>of</b> <b>themes</b> within {{the plot of}} Thalaba. Three times he attained a paradise {{that turns out to}} be false, and this is followed by the death of a woman who are gone until the very end when Thalaba is awarded entrance into a true paradise. The seeking out of mythic figures to guide him onto the next part of the tale is equally repetitive and has little result for the plot. Various instances of the sorcerers and sorceresses are added to the story to emphasise the evil of magic along with tempting Thalaba with power. However, the emphasis on magic hides the moral within Thalaba's temptations. Although Thalaba does achieve his goal through moral submission, many of the quests and actions are arbitrary and repetitive. As such, they take away from any Islamic truth that could be found within the actions.|$|E
