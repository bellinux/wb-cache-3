5|$|As many {{symptoms}} <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> poisoning {{also occur}} {{with many other}} types of poisonings and infections (such as the flu), the diagnosis is often difficult. A history of potential carbon monoxide exposure, such as being exposed to a residential fire, may suggest poisoning, but the diagnosis is confirmed by measuring the levels <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> in the blood. This can be determined by measuring the amount of carboxyhemoglobin compared {{to the amount of}} hemoglobin in the blood.|$|E

5|$|The precise {{mechanisms}} by which the effects <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> are induced upon bodily systems, are complex and not yet fully understood.

40|$|Production of {{synthesis}} gas with coal {{and natural gas}} co-gasification is a new process based on coupling of methane steam-reforming and coal gasification. The process concept is discussed in this paper. Experiments are carried out in a laboratory fixed-bed gasifying reactor to investigate the effect of feedstock on composition, ratio <b>of</b> hydrogen to <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide,</b> concentrations <b>of</b> hydrogen and <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> in the produced raw {{synthesis gas}}. Preliminary experimental {{results indicate that the}} effect of steam flow rate on component, ratio <b>of</b> hydrogen to <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> and concentrations <b>of</b> hydrogen and <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> <b>of</b> the raw synthesis gas is slight, while the effect of oxygen flow rate is pronounced. When the ratio of oxygen to methane in feedstock is below 1, the ratio <b>of</b> hydrogen to <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> is greater than I and the total concentration <b>of</b> hydrogen and <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> is above 90 %. Comparison of experimental results with calculated results shows that the composition of raw synthesis gas is near equilibrium. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the photosphere, six other components of Betelgeuse's atmosphere have now been identified.

5|$|Neptune's spectra {{suggest that}} its lower {{stratosphere}} is hazy due to condensation of products of ultraviolet photolysis of methane, such as ethane and ethyne.

The stratosphere of Neptune is warmer than that of Uranus due to the elevated concentration of hydrocarbons.|$|E
5|$|A CO-oximeter {{can be used}} to {{determine}} carboxyhemoglobin levels. Pulse CO-oximeters estimate carboxyhemoglobin with a non-invasive finger clip similar to a pulse oximeter. These devices function by passing various wavelengths of light through the fingertip and measuring the light absorption of the different types of hemoglobin in the capillaries. The use of a regular pulse oximeter is not effective in the diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> poisoning as people with carbon monoxide poisoning may have a normal oxygen saturation level on a pulse oximeter. This is due to the carboxyhemoglobin being misrepresented as oxyhemoglobin.|$|E

5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} also binds to the hemeprotein myoglobin. It {{has a high}} {{affinity for}} myoglobin, about 60 times {{greater than that of}} oxygen. Carbon monoxide bound to myoglobin may impair its ability to utilize oxygen. This causes reduced cardiac output and hypotension, which may result in brain ischemia. A delayed return of symptoms have been reported. This results following a recurrence of increased carboxyhemoglobin levels; this effect may be due to a late release <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> from myoglobin, which subsequently binds to hemoglobin.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} is {{a product}} of combustion of organic matter under conditions of restricted oxygen supply, which prevents complete oxidation to carbon dioxide (CO2). Sources <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> include cigarette smoke, house fires, faulty furnaces, heaters, wood-burning stoves, internal combustion vehicle exhaust, electrical generators, propane-fueled equipment such as portable stoves, and gasoline-powered tools such as leaf blowers, lawn mowers, high-pressure washers, concrete cutting saws, power trowels, and welders. Exposure typically occurs when equipment is used in buildings or semi-enclosed spaces.|$|E

5|$|Critics {{also pointed}} out that the index could allow the city to reach lethally high levels <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> without any alert if the levels of other {{pollutants}} remained low. However, the department had to contend with the fact that no universally accepted standards for recording smog existed at that time, and many of the flaws existed {{for lack of a better}} alternative. During the 1966 smog, one of the former commissioners said he would have readily adopted a better system, if one existed.|$|E
5|$|Hyperbaric oxygen is {{also used}} in the {{treatment}} <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> poisoning, as it may hasten dissociation of CO from carboxyhemoglobin and cytochrome oxidase {{to a greater extent}} than normal oxygen. Hyperbaric oxygen at three times atmospheric pressure reduces the half life <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> to 23 (~80/3 minutes) minutes, compared to 80 minutes for oxygen at regular atmospheric pressure. It may also enhance oxygen transport to the tissues by plasma, partially bypassing the normal transfer through hemoglobin. However, it is controversial whether hyperbaric oxygen actually offers any extra benefits over normal high flow oxygen, in terms of increased survival or improved long-term outcomes. There have been randomized controlled trials in which the two treatment options have been compared; of the six performed, four found hyperbaric oxygen improved outcome and two found no benefit for hyperbaric oxygen. Some of these trials have been criticized for apparent flaws in their implementation. A review of all the literature on carbon monoxide poisoning treatment concluded that the role of hyperbaric oxygen is unclear and the available evidence neither confirms nor denies a medically meaningful benefit. The authors suggested a large, well designed, externally audited, multicentre trial to compare normal oxygen with hyperbaric oxygen.|$|E
5|$|The LIRGs that host {{hydroxyl}} megamasers may {{be distinguished}} {{from the general population}} of LIRGs by their molecular gas content. The majority of molecular gas is molecular hydrogen, and typical hydroxyl megamaser hosts have molecular gas densities greater than 1000cm−3. These densities are among the highest mean densities of molecular gas among LIRGs. The LIRGs that host hydroxyl megamasers also have high fractions of dense gas relative to typical LIRGs. The dense gas fraction is measured by the ratio of the luminosity produced by hydrogen cyanide (HCN) relative to the luminosity <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> (CO).|$|E

5|$|Ariel {{is thought}} to have formed from an {{accretion}} disc or subnebula; a disc of gas and dust that either existed around Uranus for some time after its formation or was created by the giant impact that most likely gave Uranus its large obliquity. The precise composition of the subnebula is not known; however, the higher density of Uranian moons compared to the moons of Saturn indicates that it may have been relatively water-poor. Significant amounts of carbon and nitrogen may have been present in the form <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> (CO) and molecular nitrogen (N2), instead of methane and ammonia. The moons that formed in such a subnebula would contain less water ice (with CO and N2 trapped as clathrate) and more rock, explaining the higher density.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning in {{pregnant women}} may cause severe adverse fetal effects. Poisoning causes fetal tissue hypoxia by decreasing {{the release of}} maternal oxygen to the fetus. Carbon monoxide also crosses the placenta and combines with fetal hemoglobin, causing more direct fetal tissue hypoxia. Additionally, fetal hemoglobin has a 10 to 15% higher affinity for carbon monoxide than adult hemoglobin, causing more severe poisoning in the fetus than in the adult. Elimination <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> is slower in the fetus, leading to an accumulation of the toxic chemical. The level of fetal morbidity and mortality in acute carbon monoxide poisoning is significant, so despite mild maternal poisoning or following maternal recovery, severe fetal poisoning or death may still occur.|$|E
