Infrared observations showed that the dust cloud around the star is primarily carbon in an amorphous form. In 2009 it was discovered that the dust shell is strongly asymmetrical, as a disc with a major axis oriented at an angle of 134°, and inclination of around 75°. The disc is thought to be growing more opaque due to the fast spectral evolution of the source towards lower temperatures.|$|E

However, high Q cavities on the order of {{the same size as the}} <b>optical</b> <b>wavelength</b> have been difficult to produce due to the inverse relationship between radiation losses and cavity size. When dealing with a cavity {{much larger than}} the <b>optical</b> <b>wavelength,</b> it is simple to design interfaces such that light ray paths fulfill total internal reflection conditions or Bragg reflection conditions. For light confined within much smaller cavities near the size of the <b>optical</b> <b>wavelength,</b> deviations from ray optics approximations become severe and it becomes infeasible, if not impossible to design a cavity which fulfills optimum reflection conditions for all three spatial components of the propagating light wave vectors.|$|E

25|$|Metals {{can also}} be an {{effective}} way to confine light in structures equal to or smaller than the <b>optical</b> <b>wavelength.</b> This effect is emergent from the confined surface plasmon resonance induced by the resonating light, which, when confined to the surface of a nanostructure such as a gold channel or nanorod, induces electromagnetic resonance. Surface plasmon effects are strong in the visible range because the permittivity of a metal is very large and negative at visible frequencies. At frequencies higher than the visible range, the permittivity of a metal is closer to zero, and the metal stops being useful for focussing electric and magnetic fields. This effect was originally observed in radio and microwave engineering, where metal antennas and waveguides may be hundreds of times smaller than the free-space wavelength. In the same way, visible light can be constricted to the nano level with metal structures which form channels, tips, gaps, etc. Gold is also a convenient choice for nanofabrication because of its unreactivity and ease of use with chemical vapour deposition.|$|E
25|$|A common {{photonic}} crystal nanocavity design shown {{is essentially a}} {{photonic crystal}} with an intentional defect (holes missing). This structure having periodic changes in refractive index {{on the order of}} the length of the <b>optical</b> <b>wavelength</b> satisfies Bragg reflection conditions in the y and z directions for a particular wavelength range, and the slab boundaries in the x direction create another reflective boundary due to oblique reflection at dielectric boundaries. This results in theoretically perfect wave confinement in the y and z directions along the axis of a lattice row, and good confinement along the x direction. Since this confinement effect along the y and z directions (directions of the crystal lattice) is only for a range of frequencies, it has been referred to as a photonic bandgap, since there is a discrete set of photon energies which cannot propagate in the lattice directions in the material. However, because of the diffraction of waves propagating inside this structure, radiation energy does escape the cavity within the photonic crystal slab plane. The lattice spacing can be tuned to produce optimal boundary conditions of the standing wave inside the cavity to produce minimal loss and highest Q.|$|E

Chang et al. demonstrated lasing using [...] ethanol microdroplets (20–40 micrometers in radius) doped with rhodamine 6G dye.

2500|$|Nanophotonic {{circuit designs}} {{are similar in}} {{appearance}} to microwave and radio circuits, minimized {{by a factor of}} 100,000 or more. Researchers have made nano-optical antennas which emulate the design and functionality of radio antennas. There are a number of important differences between nanophotonics and scaled down microwave circuits. At optical frequency, metals behave much less like ideal conductors, and also exhibit plasmon-related effects like kinetic inductance and surface plasmon resonance. A nantenna is a nanoscopic rectifying antenna, a technology being developed to convert light into electric power. The concept is based on the rectenna which is used in wireless power transmission. A rectenna functions like a specialized radio antenna which is used to convert radio waves into direct current electricity. Light is composed of electromagnetic waves like radio waves, but of a much smaller wavelength. A nantenna, an application of a nanophotonic resonator, is a nanoscale rectenna on the order of the <b>optical</b> <b>wavelength</b> size, which acts as an [...] "antenna" [...] for light, converting light into electricity. Arrays of nantennas could be an efficient means of converting sunlight into electric power, producing solar energy more efficiently than semiconductor bandgap solar cells.|$|E
2500|$|In {{applications}} {{where a small}} focused beam is needed, the waveguide must be made narrow, on {{the order}} of the <b>optical</b> <b>wavelength.</b> This way, only a single transverse mode is supported and one ends up with a diffraction-limited beam. Such single spatial mode devices are used for optical storage, laser pointers, and fiber optics. Note that these lasers may still support multiple longitudinal modes, and thus can lase at multiple wavelengths simultaneously. [...] The wavelength emitted {{is a function of the}} band-gap of the semiconductor material and the modes of the optical cavity. In general, the maximum gain will occur for photons with energy slightly above the band-gap energy, and the modes nearest the peak of the gain curve will lase most strongly. The width of the gain curve will determine the number of additional [...] "side modes" [...] that may also lase, depending on the operating conditions. [...] Single spatial mode lasers that can support multiple longitudinal modes are called Fabry Perot (FP) lasers. [...] An FP laser will lase at multiple cavity modes within the gain bandwidth of the lasing medium. [...] The number of lasing modes in an FP laser is usually unstable, and can fluctuate due to changes in current or temperature.|$|E
