Shortly afterwards a pressure group, The Friends of Scout and Knowle Moor, was formed, and on 9 September 2003 representatives of the group attended a meeting of the Metropolitan Borough of Bury's, Ramsbottom and Tottington Area Board to oppose the plans. At the meeting, the spokesperson for the group said that, although they supported the use of alternative energy, they felt that this was the wrong area. Among the objections were that the scheme was contrary to the Unitary Development Plan and the Green Belt, and would adversely affect common land, open countryside and areas of ecological importance and special landscape value. The group also considered that the proposed development would be <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> with the landscape, adversely affecting peat, water courses and wildlife, and would have a seriously detrimental visual impact, as well as causing a noise nuisance.|$|E

The interest in the book's illustrations lies in the microscopic accuracy of the insects rather than in any human qualities exhibited by Mrs. Tittlemouse or Mr. Jackson. [...] Potter is uncharacteristically careless in the depiction of the insects however. They appear to be drawn for their own sake, or seem to be <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> with the heroine, or to change scale without reason. The ladybird seems larger than Mrs. Tittlemouse, and the spider appears first larger than Mrs. Tittlemouse in one picture and then smaller in another.

500|$|One {{work that}} survived {{long enough to}} be {{recorded}} in an 18th-century painting had a very similar gold castle as its base, with a paradisal garden within the walls, in this case with trees bearing pearls and red gems. [...] However the rest of the piece was very different in scale, with a single large white enamel figure of the Archangel Michael impaling Satan with a lance-like jewelled cross, completely <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> with the garden in which he stands. This is the St Michael and the Devil Group, which can be reliably dated to before 1397, when it was given to King Charles VI of France, Berry's nephew, as a New Year's gift by another uncle, Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. [...] It later passed to a church at Ingolstadt in Bavaria, where it remained until it was destroyed in 1801.|$|E
500|$|Ruth was {{the first}} {{baseball}} star {{to be the subject}} of overwhelming public adulation. Baseball had been known for star players such as Ty Cobb and [...] "Shoeless Joe" [...] Jackson, but both men had uneasy relations with fans. In Cobb's case, the incidents were sometimes marked by violence. Ruth's biographers agreed that he benefited from the timing of his ascension to [...] "Home Run King". The country had been hit hard by both the war and the 1918 flu pandemic and longed for something to help put these traumas behind it. Ruth also resonated in a country which felt, {{in the aftermath of the}} war, that it took second place to no one. Montville argued that Ruth was a larger-than-life figure who was capable of unprecedented athletic feats in the nation's largest city. The Babe became an icon of the significant social changes that marked the early 1920s. In his history of the Yankees, Glenn Stout noted [...] that [...] "Ruth was New York incarnate—uncouth and raw, flamboyant and flashy, oversized, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale,</b> and absolutely unstoppable".|$|E
500|$|In late 1977, Koubek also {{completed}} the Camden Yards Sports Complex master site plan, which laid out projected baseball and football stadiums, museums, restaurants, and retail shopping buildings {{in an attempt}} to revitalized the economically depressed Camden Yards area of downtown Baltimore. In September 1978, Koubek was commissioned to design an addition to the American Security Bank operations center at 635 Massachusetts Avenue NW. (National Public Radio purchased the building in 1992, but sold the black-glass and travertine marble structure to Boston Properties in 2008. After the broadcaster's new building at 1111 North Capitol Street was completed in 2013, Boston Properties tore down 635 Massachusetts Avenue. A Class A office building will be erected in its place by 2015.) Also in 1978, Koubek's 22-story Virginia Electric and Power Company headquarters in Richmond also opened. (It is now known as One James River Plaza.) In March 1979, Koubek agreed to design the interior renovations to the East Capitol Street Car Barn, an 83-year-old trolley barn at 14th and East Capitol Streets NE listed on the National Register of Historic Places, turning the old industrial site into a $10 million apartment and condominium complex. The renovation was called [...] "striking". Koubek also participated in the redevelopment of Vermont Avenue NW. [...] In June 1979, as buildings were razed across the street for the construction of 1090 Vermont Avenue, he was commissioned by the D.C. chapter of the American Medical Association to build a Modernist 12-story office building at 1100 Vermont Avenue NW. A month later, construction began on Koubek's Spring Valley Center, a luxury shopping, restaurant, and office building located at 4801 Massachusetts Avenue NW (on the site of the old Apex Theater). The six-story post-Modernist brick structure was not well received. In 1998, one critic noted that it is [...] "a structure easy to dislike. Clad in brick and encircled by horizontal window bands, it [...] volumetrically and dimensionally <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> with its more domestically scaled neighbors. Unrelieved planar walls and minimalist detailing made it even less charming." [...] (The structure was sold to American University's Washington College of Law in 1994 after a lengthy legal battle, and turned into classrooms and professors' offices.) ...|$|E

2500|$|In A Short History of Financial Euphoria (1994), he traces {{speculative}} bubbles {{through several}} centuries, {{and argues that}} they are inherent in the free market system because of [...] "mass psychology" [...] and the [...] "vested interest in error that accompanies speculative euphoria." [...] Also, financial memory is [...] "notoriously short": what currently {{seems to be a}} [...] "new financial instrument" [...] is inevitably nothing of the sort. Galbraith cautions: [...] "The world of finance hails the invention of the wheel over and over again, often in a slightly more unstable version."

[...] The financial crisis of 2008, which took many economists by surprise, seemed to confirm many of Galbraith's theses.|$|E
60|$|When {{it rains}}, it rains easily in Rome. But {{the weather was}} divine the evening I looked one of my latest looks down on the Spanish Steps. The sun had sunk rather wanly beyond the city, but a cheerful light of {{electrics}} shone up {{at me from the}} Via dei Condotti. I stood and thought of as much as I could summon from the past, and I was strongest, I do not know why, with the persecutions of the early Christians. Presently a smell of dinner came from the hotels around and the houses below, and I was reminded to go home to my own table d'hote. My one-legged beggar seemed to have gone to his, and I escaped him; but I was intercepted by the sight of an old woman asleep over her store of matches. She was not wakened by the fall of my ten-centime piece in her tray, but the boy drowsing beside her roused himself, and roused her to the dreamy expression of a gratitude quite <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> with my alms.|$|E

6000|$|It {{is part of}} {{the wealth}} of the lower church that it {{contains}} an admirable primitive fresco by an artist of genius rarely encountered, Pietro Cavallini, pupil of Giotto. This represents the Crucifixion; the three crosses rising into a sky spotted with the winged heads of angels while a dense crowd presses below. You will nowhere see anything more direfully lugubrious, or more approaching for direct force, though not of course for amplitude of style, Tintoretto's great renderings of the scene in Venice. The abject anguish of the crucified and the straddling authority and brutality of the mounted guards in the foreground are contrasted in a fashion worthy of a great dramatist. But the most poignant touch is the tragic grimaces of the little angelic heads that fall like hailstones through the dark air. It is genuine realistic weeping, the act of irrepressible [...] "crying," [...] that the painter has depicted, and the effect is pitiful {{at the same time as}} grotesque. There are many more frescoes besides; all the chapels on one side are lined with them, but these are chiefly interesting in their general impressiveness--as they people the dim recesses with startling presences, with apparitions <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale.</b> Before leaving the place I lingered long near the door, for I was sure I shouldn't soon again enjoy such a feast of scenic composition. The opposite end glowed with subdued colour; the middle portion was vague and thick and brown, with two or three scattered worshippers looming through the obscurity; while, all the way down, the polished pavement, its uneven slabs glittering dimly in the obstructed light, was of the very essence of expensive picture. It is certainly desirable, if one takes the lower church of St. Francis to represent the human heart, that one should find a few bright places there. But if the general effect is of brightness terrorised and smothered, is the symbol less valid? For the contracted, prejudiced, passionate heart let it stand.|$|E
6000|$|For {{the first}} two months the bishop's {{attention}} was so detached from his immediate surroundings and employments, so absorbed by great events, that his history if it were told in detail would differ scarcely at all from the histories of most comparatively unemployed minds during those first dramatic days, the days when the Germans made their great rush upon Paris and it seemed that France was down, France and the whole fabric of liberal civilization. He emerged from these stunning apprehensions after the Battle of the Marne, to find himself busy upon a score of dispersed and disconnected war jobs, and trying to get all the new appearances and forces and urgencies of the war into relations with himself. One thing became very vivid indeed, that he wasn't being used in any real and effective way in the war. There was a mighty going to and fro upon Red Cross work and various war committees, a vast preparation for wounded men and for the succour of dislocated families; a preparation, that proved to be needless, for catastrophic unemployment. The war problem and the puzzle of German psychology ousted for a time all other intellectual interests; like every one else the bishop swam deep in Nietzsche, Bernhardi, Houston Stewart Chamberlain, and the like; he preached several sermons upon German materialism and the astonishing decay of the German character. He also read every newspaper he could lay his hands on--like any secular man. He signed an address to the Russian Orthodox church, beginning [...] "Brethren," [...] and he revised his impressions of the Filioque controversy. The idea of a reunion of the two great state churches of Russia and England had always attracted him. But hitherto it had been a thing quite <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale,</b> visionary, utopian. Now in this strange time of altered perspectives it seemed the most practicable of suggestions. The mayor and corporation and a detachment of the special reserve in uniform came to a great intercession service, and in the palace there were two conferences of local influential people, people of the most various types, people who had never met tolerantly before, expressing now opinions of unprecedented breadth and liberality.|$|E
60|$|The tenement-house, {{such as it}} is, is the {{original}} of the apartment-house, which perpetuates {{some of its most}} characteristic features on a scale and in material undreamed of in the simple philosophy of the inventor of the tenement-house. The worst of these features is the want of light and air, but as much more space and as many more rooms are conceded as the tenant will pay for. The apartment-house, however, soars to heights that the tenement-house never half reached, and is sometimes ten stories high. It is built fireproof, very often, and is generally equipped with an elevator, which runs night and day, and makes one level of all the floors. The cheaper sort, or those which have departed less from the tenement-house original, have no elevators, but the street door in all is kept shut and locked, and is opened only by the tenant's latch-key or by the janitor having charge of the whole building. In the finer houses there is a page whose sole duty it is to open and shut this door, and who is usually brass-buttoned to one blinding effect of livery with the elevator-boy. Where this page or hall-boy is found, the elevator carries you to the door of any apartment you seek; where he is not found, there is a bell and a speaking-tube in the lower entry, for each apartment, and you ring up the occupant and talk to him as many stories off as he happens to be. But people who can afford to indulge their pride will not live in this sort of apartment-house, and the rents in them are much lower than in the finer sort. The finer sort are vulgarly fine for the most part, with a gaudy splendor of mosaic pavement, marble stairs, frescoed ceilings, painted walls, and cabinet wood-work. But there are many that are fine in a good taste, in the things that are common to the inmates. Their fittings for housekeeping are of all degrees of perfection, and, except for the want of light and air, life in them has a high degree of gross luxury. They are heated throughout with pipes of steam or hot water, and they are sometimes lighted with both gas and electricity, which the inmate uses at will, though of course at his own cost. Outside, they are the despair of architecture, for no style has yet been invented which enables the artist to characterize them with beauty, and wherever they lift their vast bulks they deform the whole neighborhood, throwing the other buildings <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale,</b> and making it impossible for future edifices to assimilate themselves to the intruder.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{aim of this}} {{retrospective}} multicentric {{study was}} to assess developmental milestones longitudinally in type I SMA infants using the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination. Thirty-three type I SMA infants, who classically do not achieve the ability to sit unsupported, {{were included in the}} study. Our results confirmed that all patients had a score <b>of</b> 0 <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> 4 on items assessing sitting, rolling, crawling, standing or walking. A score of more than 0 was only achieved in three items: head control (n[*]=[*] 13), kicking (n[*]=[*] 15) and hand grasp (n[*]=[*] 18). In these items, the maximal score achieved was 1 <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> 4, indicating only partial achievement of the milestone. Infants with symptom onset after 6 months of age had longer preservation of a score of 1 when compared to those with onset before 6 months of age.

No infants in this study achieved a major milestone such as rolling over, or sitting independently, which would therefore represent robust outcomes in future interventional trials...|$|R
