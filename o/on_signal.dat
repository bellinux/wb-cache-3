It also criticised the railway company and the government for using the older wooden stock for the troop train, arguing that it was already known it was unsafe {{and in the process}} of withdrawal, and this was a risk that was not justified even in the environment of war.|$|E

500|$|However, {{a couple}} of days after the station opened, there were some {{problems}} in and around the station, which multiple news outlets criticized. An escalator broke down on September 14, just a day after the station's opening. In an unrelated September 16 incident, a straphanger got injured while walking up another escalator at the 34th Street station. Earlier that day, the New York Post reported <b>on</b> <b>signal</b> problems in the brand-new tunnels around the station, while riders complained about the delays on Twitter and Reddit. A Wall Street Journal commentator remarked that [...] "it's only a matter of months (make that weeks) before the gleaming station ... is pockmarked with chewing-gum spots, urban scrawl and litter." [...] Overall, however, the station received positive acclaim during its first few days of service. In an article in several newspapers distributed by NYC Community Media, Lenore Skenazy writes that many riders have praised the station's design, its cleanliness, and its climate-controlled platforms, and noted herself that the station looked and felt [...] "as uplifting as a cathedral".|$|E
