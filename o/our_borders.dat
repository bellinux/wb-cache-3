500|$|In October 2010, Savage {{released}} Trickle Up Poverty: Stopping Obama's Attack on <b>Our</b> <b>Borders,</b> Economy, and Security. Released {{through the}} HarperCollins imprint of William Morrow and Company, Savage argues {{in the book}} that [...] "Americans are boiling mad over the way Congress and this Marxist/Leninist-oriented President are manipulating the current economic crisis to nationalize businesses." ...|$|E
500|$|An alto aria, [...] (Through {{powerful}} strength You maintain <b>our</b> <b>borders)</b> {{is based}} on contemporary poetry. Set in C major with the trumpets and timpani as the only obbligato instruments, it is in two sections: the first in triple time marked Vivace corresponds to God's power and glory, while the second in common time is a prayer for peace on Earth.|$|E

6000|$|... "Thoughtful as ever," [...] smiled Nasmyth, with {{a little}} bow which was respectful as well as friendly. [...] "I needn't ask how you are; the way you walked along the {{platform}} was a testimony to <b>our</b> <b>Border</b> air." ...|$|R
5000|$|Paul F. Chavez, {{president}} of the Cesar Chavez Foundation and son of the late farmworkers' leader, said: [...] "Today, courageous members of Border Angeles are honoring the legacy of my father by making a powerful statement against inhumanity and oppression endured on <b>our</b> <b>border</b> by innocent immigrants.|$|R
500|$|In January 2003, Savage {{published}} The Savage Nation: Saving America {{from the}} Liberal Assault on <b>Our</b> <b>Borders,</b> Language and Culture, {{his first major}} book under the pseudonym Michael Savage. The book quickly {{reached the top of}} the New York Times Best Seller list, earning Savage, as noted above, a commentary show on MSNBC. The book directs attacks at [...] "liberal media bias", the [...] "dominating culture of 'she-ocracy'", gay activists, and liberals.|$|E
500|$|Dean John de Costa gave {{a sermon}} damning what he {{described}} as a [...] "deafening silence" [...] from overseas. [...] "Nobody who holds sacred the dignity of human life can be anything but sickened at the events attending the Viscount," [...] he said. [...] "But are we deafened with the voice of protest from nations who call themselves civilised? We are not! Like men in the story of the Good Samaritan, they pass by on the other side...The ghastliness of this ill-fated flight from Kariba will be burnt upon our memories for years to come. For others, far from <b>our</b> <b>borders,</b> it is an intellectual matter, not one which affects them deeply. Here is the tragedy!" ...|$|E
500|$|During that {{campaign}} Władysław started the modernisation {{program of the}} Commonwealth army, emphasising the usage of modern infantry and artillery. Władysław {{proved to be a}} good tactician, and his innovations in the use of artillery and fortifications based on Western ideas greatly contributed to the eventual Polish–Lithuanian success. King Władysław wanted to continue the war or, because the Polish–Swedish Treaty of Altmark would soon be expiring, ally with the Russians to strike against Sweden. However, the Sejm wanted no more conflict. As Stanisław Łubieński, the Bishop of Płock, wrote two weeks after Shein's surrender: [...] "Our happiness is in remaining within <b>our</b> <b>borders,</b> guaranteeing health and well-being." [...] The resulting Peace of Polyanov (Treaty of Polanów), favourable to Poland, confirmed the pre-war territorial status quo. Muscovy also agreed to pay 20,000 rubles in exchange for Wladyslaw's renunciation of all claims to the tsardom and return of the royal insignia, which were in the Commonwealth possession since the Dymitriads.|$|E
2500|$|On August 31, 2010, Giffords {{praised the}} arrival of National Guard troops on the border: [...] "Arizonans have {{waited a long time}} for the {{deployment}} of the National Guard in our state. Their arrival represents a renewed national commitment to protecting <b>our</b> <b>border</b> communities from drug cartels and smugglers." ...|$|R
5000|$|Australian PM Tony Abbott {{said the}} tragedies were [...] "worsened by Europe's refusal {{to learn from}} its own {{mistakes}} and from the efforts of others who have handled similar problems. Destroying the criminal people-smugglers was the centre of gravity of <b>our</b> <b>border</b> control policies, and judicious boat turnbacks was the key." ...|$|R
5000|$|... eminent {{international}} jurist and Member of Parliament Shri Ram Jethmalani {{said that}} book is [...] "an eye opener, {{a warning to}} us" [...] of not only of internal enemies but external ones too who are collaborating with dummies, proxies inside <b>our</b> <b>border</b> and trying to weaken India, break her unity, integration and ultimately to jeopardise our freedom, sovereignty, culture.|$|R
500|$|By {{the spring}} of 1634, the Russians had not only lost Shein's army but were {{threatened}} by Tatar raids that ravaged southern Russia. Patriarch Filaret had died the previous year, and without him the war fervour lessened. Even {{before the end of}} 1633, Tsar Michael of Russia was considering how best to end the conflict. Because he had once been elected Tsar of Russia and could realistically lay claim to the Russian throne, King Władysław wanted to continue the war or, because the Polish-Swedish Treaty of Altmark would soon be expiring, ally with the Russians to strike against Sweden. However, the Sejm wanted no more conflict. As Stanisław Łubieński, the Bishop of Płock, wrote two weeks after Shein's surrender: [...] "Our happiness is in remaining within <b>our</b> <b>borders,</b> guaranteeing health and well-being." [...] With neither side keen on prolonging the war, they began negotiating, not for an armistice but for [...] "eternal peace." ...|$|E
500|$|On November 13, the {{campaign}} released a [...] called [...] "Tough on Terror" [...] {{in which a}} hypothetical terrorist attack occurs in a shopping mall. The ad blames inept border security for the attack and flashes images of an injured child and a wrecked train. After Tancredo gives his approval for the message with the comment [...] "I approve this message because someone needs to say it," [...] a voiceover states, [...] "There are consequences to open borders beyond the 20 million aliens {{who have come to}} take our jobs... the price we pay for spineless politicians who refuse to defend <b>our</b> <b>borders</b> against those who come to kill." [...] Since its release, the ad received criticism from some who called it [...] "cheap" [...] and [...] "blatant fearmongering." [...] Bowdoin College political scientist Michael Franz likened the advertisement to the Daisy ad run by Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1964 Presidential election claiming that the election of Barry Goldwater would lead to a nuclear war. The other Republican candidates in the race did not comment on the ad.|$|E
2500|$|Seo: That is not so. Our {{country is}} in fact former Koguryŏ, {{and that is why}} it is named Koryŏ and has a capital at P'yŏngyang. If you want to discuss {{territorial}} boundaries, the Eastern Capital of your country is within <b>our</b> <b>borders....</b> Moreover, the land {{on both sides of the}} Yalu River is also within <b>our</b> <b>borders,</b> but the Jurchens have now stolen it.... If you tell us to drive out the Jurchens, recover our former territory, construct fortresses, and open the roads, then how could we dare not to have [...] relations?" ...|$|E
5000|$|During {{sentencing}} of {{a convicted}} child smuggler in December 2013, Hanen sharply rebuked the United States Department of Homeland Security for not prosecuting the child's mother. [...] Hanen wrote, [...] "DHS should cease telling {{the citizens of}} the United States that it is enforcing <b>our</b> <b>border</b> security laws because it is not. Even worse, it is helping those who violate these laws." ...|$|R
60|$|That day {{two columns}} went out: one under General Gazelee, {{to collect the}} fines {{from one of the}} tribes; the other {{commanded}} by Colonel Hill, to punish the Chamkannis. This was a small, but extremely warlike and hardy tribe. A short time before, they had raided a thousand head of cattle from across <b>our</b> <b>border,</b> and got clear away with them.|$|R

2500|$|... t least 8,000 people cross <b>our</b> <b>borders</b> {{illegally}} every day. Some {{people believe}} this is a security issue, as you know. Some believe it's an economic issue. Some see it as a human rights issue. How do you see it? And {{what we need to do}} about it? ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, {{speaking}} on illegal immigration, Steel {{called for the}} U.S. to [...] "secure <b>our</b> <b>borders</b> first," [...] saying [...] "You cannot begin to address {{the concerns of the}} people who are already here unless and until you have made certain that no more are coming in behind them." ...|$|E
2500|$|He also views American {{immigration}} laws as too restrictive and damaging to economic output: [...] "It is pure idiocy that Congress will not open <b>our</b> <b>borders</b> – {{as wide as}} possible– to attract and keep the world's first-round intellectual draft choices {{in an age when}} everyone increasingly has the same innovation tools and the key differentiator is human talent." ...|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} matrix {{bordering}} technique {{that can be}} applied to an irreducible spectrally arbitrary sign pattern to construct a higher order spectrally arbitrary sign pattern. This technique generalizes a recently developed triangle extension method. We describe recursive constructions of spectrally arbitrary patterns using <b>our</b> <b>bordering</b> technique, and show that a slight variation of this technique can be used to construct inertially arbitrary sign patterns...|$|R
5000|$|Regarding immigration, Gosar has stated, [...] "I {{strongly}} believe {{we need to}} immediately secure <b>our</b> <b>border</b> and oppose amnesty for anyone who blatantly violates our law." [...] He has cosponsored multiple bills that would impose regulations on immigration. For example, Gosar cosponsored the Birthright Citizenship Act of 2011, {{a bill that would}} eliminate birthright citizenship for children born in the US to undocumented immigrants.|$|R
6000|$|Graeme's cheek reddened {{deeply as}} he replied, {{not without some}} emphasis, [...] "To hunt red-deer of the first head, and to strike down herons of the highest soar, my lord, which, in Lothian speech, may be termed, for aught I know, coneys and ouzels;-also I can wield a brand and couch a lance, {{according}} to <b>our</b> <b>Border</b> meaning; in inland speech these may be termed water-flags and bulrushes." ...|$|R
2500|$|Dr. Vanderpool {{shifted his}} {{focus in the}} {{aftermath}} of the earthquake that devastated the entire country of Haiti in 2010. In 2010, Vanderpool officially changed the name of his organization from Mobile Medical Disaster Relief to Live Beyond with a stated mission to be [...] "an organization that chooses to Live Beyond...ourselves, our culture, <b>our</b> <b>borders</b> and this life so that others can Live Beyond…disease, hunger, poverty and despair." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 114th Congress, Representative Miller {{continued}} to push needed legislation that helped ensure we implement strong protections for <b>our</b> <b>borders</b> and global supply chain. [...] Our nation’s borders {{can and must}} be secured, and her goal has been to see that DHS is making progress to confront the threats of terrorism, cyber terrorism, and mismanagement of the Department in these areas vital to our national security, and continuing to work towards a secure border and a safer homeland.|$|E
2500|$|In 1839, Lamar {{announced}} his policy: [...] "The white {{man and the}} red man cannot dwell in harmony together", he said, [...] "Nature forbids it." [...] His answer to the 'Indian Problem' was: [...] "to push a rigorous war against them; pursuing them to their hiding places without mitigation or compassion, until they shall be made to feel that flight from <b>our</b> <b>borders</b> without hope of return, is preferable to the scourges of war." [...] [...] "Texas Beyond History: The Die is Cast"], September 7, 2007.|$|E
500|$|The GDR's {{leadership}} explicitly {{endorsed the}} use of deadly force. General Heinz Hoffmann, the GDR defence minister, declared in August 1966 that [...] "anyone who does not respect <b>our</b> <b>border</b> will feel the bullet". In 1974, Erich Honecker, as Chairman of the GDR's National Defence Council, ordered: [...] "Firearms are to be ruthlessly used {{in the event of}} attempts to break through the border, and the comrades who have successfully used their firearms are to be commended." ...|$|R
5000|$|When Colonel Arbuckle left Fort Gibson in 1841, he {{reported}} that despite the arrival of 40,000 eastern Native Americans of decidedly unfriendly disposition, [...] "I have maintained peace on this frontier and at no period have the Whites on <b>our</b> <b>border</b> or the Red people of this frontier been in a more perfect state of quiet and Security than they enjoy now." [...] The removed Native American nations gradually lost their desire for American military protection.|$|R
2500|$|In 2013, Overstock began {{promoting}} increased immigration. Overstock president Jonathan Johnson {{told the}} Los Angeles Times that his firm had struggled to hire enough computer programmers and software developers {{to expand the}} business. [...] "We pay more, {{and they are still}} hard to fill", he said. [...] "We need to be more free in letting people in. That helps us solve <b>our</b> <b>border</b> problem. No one goes through the window of a house if they can ring the doorbell and come in the front door." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "I {{believe we}} must secure <b>our</b> <b>borders,</b> fix our broken {{immigration}} bureaucracy, and require the 12 million undocumented {{to get on}} a responsible path to citizenship.

2500|$|In {{addressing}} the Pew Research Center’s Forum on Religion & Public Life in 2009, Archbishop Charles J. Chaput of Denver discussed the need {{when talking about}} reforming immigration law, to do so [...] "...in a comprehensive way, so that justice is done and <b>our</b> <b>borders</b> are protected. It’s always both/and; it’s not either/or from my perspective." [...] "o one can claim to be Catholic and think it’s okay to treat immigrants unjustly or inhumanly. But you can disagree on immigration policies because you think that one works and one doesn’t." ...|$|E

2500|$|Problems with India rose up when India {{attacked}} {{and took the}} Siachen glacier, prompting Pakistan to strike back, leading Indian Army to formalize a controversial military exercise, summoning up to 400,000 troops near Southern Pakistan.
