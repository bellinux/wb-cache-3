25|$|The factors {{proposed}} to influence biological ageing {{fall into two}} main categories, programmed and damage-related. Programmed factors follow a biological timetable, perhaps <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> be {{a continuation of the}} one that regulates childhood growth and development. This regulation would depend on changes in gene expression that affect the systems responsible for maintenance, repair and defence responses. Damage-related factors include internal and environmental assaults to living organisms that induce cumulative damage at various levels.|$|E
500|$|The climactic scene {{depicting}} the mysterious beach near the galactic core where Arroway makes contact, in particular, called for major visual innovations. The goal was an idyllic seashore with a sky blazing with stars that might exist near {{the core of}} the galaxy. Ralston said that [...] "the thought was that this beach would have a heightened reality. <b>One</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> make the everyday world seem like a vague daydream." [...] To keep the question alive whether any of it was real in Arroway's mind, elements such as ocean waves running in reverse and palm tree shadows swaying with sped-up motion were applied.|$|E

5000|$|Maintenance of {{expressive}} control {{refers to}} the need to stay 'in character'. The performance has to make sure that s/he sends out the correct signals and quiets the occasional compulsion to convey misleading <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> detract from the performance.|$|R
500|$|The film also {{attracted}} criticism. UK Anime Network's Andy Hanley stated [...] "It has potential in its characters and concept, but does very little with {{them over the}} course of this film to make for a disappointly mediocre movie." [...] Similar to Silverman, Jeffrey Kauffman from Blu-ray.com noted that the film had a slow pace in developing Yuri and Flynn's relationship. He gave high praise to the animation used in the story. He criticized its supporting cast as he believes [...] "Tales of Vesperia: The First Strike is a standalone offering, or at least <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> have done better had it focused solely on Yuri and Flynn and left the rest of the 'cast of thousands' far in the background." [...] Gay was saddened by the lack of appearances from the side characters such as Siren, Hisca, and Chastel.|$|E
500|$|There {{are also}} {{instances}} in which character surnames reappear from story to story. Cleveland Arning, a character in Chabon's 1988 debut novel, The Mysteries of Pittsburgh, is described as having come from a wealthy family, <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> {{be expected to be}} able to endow a building. Near the end of Wonder Boys (1995), it is mentioned that, on the unnamed college campus at which Grady Tripp teaches, there is a building called Arning Hall [...] "where the English faculty kept office hours." [...] Similarly, in Chabon's 1989 short story [...] "A Model World," [...] a character named Levine discovers, or rather plagiarizes, a formula for [...] "nephokinesis" [...] (or cloud control) that wins him respect and prominence in the meteorological field. In The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay (2000), a passing reference is made to the [...] "massive Levine School of Applied Meteorology," [...] ostensibly a building owned by New York University.|$|E

2500|$|As the 1970 Tigers {{headed for}} their first losing season since 1963 and their worst record since 1960, Smith came under {{increasing}} criticism from fans and the press. Immediately after the season, on October 2, 1970, the Tigers fired Smith and replaced him with Billy Martin. [...] Before leaving Detroit, Smith called the city a great sports town in his farewell news conference, but he privately lashed out at the fans {{in a conversation with}} reporters: [...] "They wouldn't know a baseball player from a Japanese aviator. The fans in Detroit are ignorant. [...] They'd rather see you leave a tired pitcher in and get beat with a complete game than bring in a fresh <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> win it for you." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the O'Neil series, Vic Sage is {{an investigative}} {{reporter}} for the news station KBEL in Hub City. He uses {{the identity of the}} Question to get the answers his civilian identity cannot. Unlike other vigilante superheroes, O'Neil's Question is primarily focused on the politics of his city, and rather than hunting down the perpetrators of petty theft, he tends to fight the corrupt government of Hub City. O'Neil's Hub City is noted as being [...] "synonymous with venality, corruption and violence", perhaps even surpassing Gotham City as the most dismal city in the DC Universe-version of the US. Despite the impoverished and scandalous nature of Hub City, O'Neil insists repeatedly that it is based on an actual US city, though for most of the series, he refused to comment on which <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> be. He eventually confirmed, {{near the end of the}} series, that Hub City was based on East St. Louis, Illinois.|$|E

Abbasi led the company through the recession with it experiencing 10 percent revenue growth and 20 percent non-GAAP net income growth, while non-GAAP operating margins expanded 3% to an annual record 25%. The company's growth also allowed hiring and expansion to continue through the recession.|$|R
