5|$|Whippets course, work, and race; {{they have}} been bred for these jobs for years. This has kept them a {{structurally}} sound breed which is predominantly free from the physical exaggerations {{that can lead to}} certain health problems. Whippets are, like other sighthounds, intolerant of barbiturate anaesthetics. This is in part due to their low concentration <b>of</b> <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> and their liver's inability to metabolise the anaesthetics.|$|E
5|$|External parasites of {{the garden}} warbler include the fleas Ceratophyllus gallinae and Dasypsyllus gallinulae and the mite Syringophilosis borini, named after its host. Two species of {{protozoan}} parasites in the genus Isospora occur in garden warblers, I. sylvianthina and I. sylviae. Samples from two sites showed infection levels above 74% and 28% respectively for the two species. The extent of infection does not impact on the bird's body mass or the amount <b>of</b> <b>body</b> <b>fat.</b> Three strains of another protozoan, Haemoproteus parabelopolskyi are found only in the garden warbler, and form a monophyletic group. Seventeen further members of that group are found only in the blackcap, and another three occur in the African hill babbler, supporting the shared ancestry of the three bird species.|$|E
5|$|About 90% of beetle species enter {{a period}} of adult diapause, a quiet phase with reduced {{metabolism}} to tide unfavourable environmental conditions. Adult diapause {{is the most common}} form of diapause in Coleoptera. To endure the period without food (often lasting many months) adults prepare by accumulating reserves of lipids, glycogen, proteins and other substances needed for resistance to future hazardous changes of environmental conditions. This diapause is induced by signals heralding the arrival of the unfavourable season; usually the cue is photoperiodic. Short (decreasing) day length serves as a signal of approaching winter and induces winter diapause (hibernation). A study of hibernation in the Arctic beetle Pterostichus brevicorni showed that the body fat levels of adults were highest in autumn with the alimentary canal filled with food, but empty by the end of January. This loss <b>of</b> <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> was a gradual process, occurring in combination with dehydration.|$|E

50|$|In {{those with}} a BMI under 35, intra-abdominal <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> is related to {{negative}} health outcomes independent <b>of</b> total <b>body</b> <b>fat.</b> Intra-abdominal or visceral fat has a particularly strong correlation with cardiovascular disease.|$|R
5|$|Women develop {{long-term}} {{complications of}} alcohol dependence {{more rapidly than}} do men. Additionally, women have a higher mortality rate from alcoholism than men. Examples of long-term complications include brain, heart, and liver damage and {{an increased risk of}} breast cancer. Additionally, heavy drinking over time has been found to {{have a negative effect on}} reproductive functioning in women. This results in reproductive dysfunction such as anovulation, decreased ovarian mass, problems or irregularity of the menstrual cycle, and early menopause. Alcoholic ketoacidosis can occur in individuals who chronically abuse alcohol and have a recent history of binge drinking. The amount of alcohol that can be biologically processed and its effects differ between sexes. Equal dosages of alcohol consumed by men and women generally result in women having higher blood alcohol concentrations (BACs), since women generally have a higher percentage <b>of</b> <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> and therefore a lower volume of distribution for alcohol than men, and because the stomachs of men tend to metabolize alcohol more quickly.|$|E
25|$|When {{treated with}} GH, a {{deficient}} child {{will begin to}} grow faster within months. Other benefits may be noticed, such as increased strength, progress in motor development, and reduction <b>of</b> <b>body</b> <b>fat.</b> Side-effects {{of this type of}} physiologic replacement are quite rare.|$|E
25|$|In Singapore, the BMI cut-off {{figures were}} revised in 2005, {{motivated}} by {{studies showing that}} many Asian populations, including Singaporeans, have higher proportion <b>of</b> <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> and increased risk for cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus, compared with Caucasians at the same BMI. The BMI cut-offs are presented {{with an emphasis on}} health risk rather than weight.|$|E

40|$|Objective. The study {{objective}} was to examine relationships between different body size measurements and asthma in ethnic minority children. Methods. We used data from a community-based study of 505 children aged 6 -to- 8 years old to study the association <b>of</b> percent <b>body</b> <b>fat,</b> fat distribution, and BMI percentile with asthma diagnosis. Poisson regression models were used to compute prevalence ratios (PRs) for sex-specific quintiles <b>of</b> the <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> measures on the main outcome of asthma. Results. When comparing the highest quintile <b>of</b> each <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> measure to the combined lowest two quintiles, higher body mass index percentile, percent <b>body</b> <b>fat,</b> and waist circumference all were associated with a higher likelihood of physician-diagnosed asthma (PR = 1. 63 (95 % CI 1. 12 – 2. 39), 1. 50 (95 % CI 1. 02 – 2. 21), and 1. 56 (95 % CI 1. 04 – 2. 34), resp.).

25|$|Gender: Women {{are twice}} as {{susceptible}} to alcohol-related liver disease, and may develop alcoholic liver disease with shorter durations and doses of chronic consumption. The lesser amount of alcohol dehydrogenase secreted in the gut, higher proportion <b>of</b> <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> in women, and changes in fat absorption due to the menstrual cycle may explain this phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|Nutritional {{factors are}} {{the strongest and}} most obvious {{environmental}} factors affecting timing of puberty. Girls are especially sensitive to nutritional regulation because they must contribute all of the nutritional support to a growing fetus. Surplus calories (beyond growth and activity requirements) {{are reflected in the}} amount <b>of</b> <b>body</b> <b>fat,</b> which signals to the brain the availability of resources for initiation of puberty and fertility.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of osteoarthritis is correlated {{with a history}} of previous joint injury and with obesity, especially with respect to knees. Since the correlation with obesity has been observed not only for knees but also for non-weight bearing joints and the loss <b>of</b> <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> is more closely related to symptom relief than the loss of body weight, {{it has been suggested that}} there may be a metabolic link to body fat as opposed to just mechanical loading.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the {{adoption}} of DXA, the most accurate method <b>of</b> estimating <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> percentage was to measure that person's average density (total mass divided by total volume) and apply a formula to convert that to <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> percentage.|$|R
50|$|However, the {{relationship}} between measurements of subcutaneous fat in skinfolds, such as the triceps skinfold, and deep <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> have been questioned. Early research in the 1960s found {{a positive correlation between}} the two, and the skinfold measurements do provide a reasonable estimate <b>of</b> the deep <b>body</b> <b>fat.</b> However, research in the 1980s used computed tomography to measure deep fat, and showed a lack of correlation between that and subcutaneous fat. However, for children and adolescents the skinfold and circumference measurements provide a fair assessment <b>of</b> total <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> because that is where most <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> lies during those stages of human growth.|$|R
2500|$|The average breast {{weighs about}} [...] Each breast {{contributes}} to about 4–5% <b>of</b> the <b>body</b> <b>fat.</b> The density <b>of</b> fatty tissue {{is more or}} less equal to 0.9kg/l for all women.|$|R
25|$|The {{subcutaneous}} tissue (also hypodermis and subcutis) {{is not part}} of the skin, and lies below the dermis of the cutis. Its purpose is to attach the skin to underlying bone and muscle as well as supplying it with blood vessels and nerves. It consists of loose connective tissue, adipose tissue and elastin. The main cell types are fibroblasts, macrophages and adipocytes ({{subcutaneous tissue}} contains 50% <b>of</b> <b>body</b> <b>fat).</b> Fat serves as padding and insulation for the body.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{remaining}} nonvisceral fat is found just below the skin in a region called the hypodermis. This subcutaneous fat {{is not related to}} many of the classic obesity-related pathologies, such as heart disease, cancer, and stroke, and some evidence even suggests it might be protective. The typically female (or gynecoid) pattern <b>of</b> <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> distribution around the hips, thighs, and buttocks is subcutaneous fat, and therefore poses less of a health risk compared to visceral fat.|$|E
25|$|During hibernation, these bats need an {{environment}} that ranges from 32 to 54 degrees Fahrenheit. Virginia big-eared bats store a certain amount <b>of</b> <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> in the winter during their hibernation, so when they are disturbed and {{the temperature of the}} cave changes, they must use up their body fat to raise the temperature of their bodies {{in order for them to}} leave the disturbed area. The burning of their fat makes them very weak and causes female bats to leave their babies if a maternity site is disturbed or altered.|$|E
5000|$|Fox co-starred in Alex Cross (2012), as the villain, Michael [...] "The Butcher" [...] Sullivan/"Picasso". Fox {{developed}} an extremely muscular physique {{for the role}} and shed most <b>of</b> his <b>body</b> <b>fat.</b>|$|R
25|$|Unintentional {{weight loss}} {{may result from}} loss <b>of</b> <b>body</b> <b>fats,</b> loss <b>of</b> <b>body</b> fluids, muscle atrophy, or even a {{combination}} of these. It is generally regarded as a medical problem when at least 10% <b>of</b> a person's <b>body</b> weight has been lost in six months or 5% in the last month. Another criterion used for assessing weight that is too low is the body mass index (BMI). However, even lesser amounts of weight loss can be a cause for serious concern in a frail elderly person.|$|R
30|$|Logistic {{regression}} analysis on anthropometric and body composition variables confirmed that all forms <b>of</b> excessive <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> are associated to metabolic syndrome, {{as opposed to}} higher proportions of muscular and fat free mass.|$|R
25|$|Using {{body fat}} {{percentages}} (BF%), however, BF-defined obesity {{was found in}} 50% of men and 62% of women. While BMI-defined obesity showed high specificity (95% for men and 99% for women), BMI showed poor sensitivity (36% for men and 49% for women). Despite this undercounting of obesity by BMI, BMI values in the intermediate BMI range of 20–30 {{were found to be}} associated with a wide range <b>of</b> <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> percentages. For men with a BMI of 25, about 20% have a body fat percentage below 20% and about 10% have body fat percentage above 30%.|$|E
25|$|BMI is {{particularly}} inaccurate {{for people who}} are very fit or athletic, as their high muscle mass can classify them in the overweight category by BMI, even though their body fat percentages frequently fall in the 10–15% category, which is below that of a more sedentary person of average build who has a normal BMI number. Body composition for athletes is often better calculated using measures <b>of</b> <b>body</b> <b>fat,</b> as determined by such techniques as skinfold measurements or underwater weighing and the limitations of manual measurement have also led to new, alternative methods to measure obesity, such as the body volume index.|$|E
25|$|The average {{human body}} with a relaxed lungful of air is close to neutral buoyancy. If the air is exhaled, most people will sink in fresh water, and with full lungs, most will float in seawater. The amount of weight {{required}} to provide neutral buoyancy to the naked diver is usually trivial, though {{there are some people}} who require several kilograms of weight to become neutral in seawater due to low average density and large size. This is usually the case with people with a large proportion <b>of</b> <b>body</b> <b>fat.</b> As the diver is nearly neutral, most ballasting is needed to compensate for the buoyancy of the diver's equipment.|$|E
50|$|The average breast {{weighs about}} 0.5 kg. Each breast {{contributes}} to about 4-5% <b>of</b> the <b>body</b> <b>fat.</b> The density <b>of</b> fatty tissue {{is more or}} less equal to 0.9 kg/l for all women.|$|R
30|$|The {{response}} <b>of</b> <b>body</b> mass index, <b>fat</b> mass, and <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> percentage to PA {{appear to}} be more dependent on shared familial factors than measures such as waist-to-hip ratio.|$|R
50|$|The {{preoccupation with}} <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> {{has a long}} {{tradition}} in the Andes region. Pre-Hispanic natives prized fat so much that a deity, Viracocha (meaning sea of fat), existed for it. It is also natural for the peasant rural poor to view fleshiness and excess <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> as the very sign of life, good health, strength and beauty. Many illnesses are thought to have their roots in the loss <b>of</b> <b>body</b> <b>fats,</b> and skeletal thinness is abhorred. With this, the conquistadores' practice of treating their wounds with their enemies' corpse fats horrified the Indians. Spaniards, are also said to have killed Indians and boiled their corpses to produce fat to grease their metal muskets and cannons, which rusted quickly in the humid Amazon.|$|R
25|$|In {{contrast}} with clinical tools, one relatively inexpensive type <b>of</b> <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> meter uses {{the principle of}} bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) {{in order to determine}} an individual's body fat percentage. To achieve this, the meter passes a small, harmless, electric current through the body and measures the resistance, then uses information on the person's weight, height, age, and sex to calculate an approximate value for the person's body fat percentage. The calculation measures the total volume of water in the body (lean tissue and muscle contain a higher percentage of water than fat), and estimates the percentage of fat based on this information. The result can fluctuate several percentage points depending on what has been eaten and how much water has been drunk before the analysis.|$|E
25|$|The major {{landmark}} {{of puberty}} for males is spermarche, the first ejaculation, which occurs, on average, at age 13. For females, it is menarche, {{the onset of}} menstruation, which occurs, on average, between ages 12 and 13. The age of menarche is influenced by heredity, but a girl's diet and lifestyle contribute as well. Regardless of genes, a girl must have a certain proportion <b>of</b> <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> to attain menarche. Consequently, girls who have a high-fat diet and who are not physically active begin menstruating earlier, on average, than girls whose diet contains less fat and whose activities involve fat reducing exercise (e.g. ballet and gymnastics). Girls who experience malnutrition or are in societies in which children are expected to perform physical labor also begin menstruating at later ages.|$|E
25|$|Fentanyl transdermal patches (Durogesic/Duragesic) {{are used}} in chronic pain management. The patches work by slowly {{releasing}} fentanyl through the skin into the bloodstream over 48 to 72 hours, allowing for long-lasting pain management. Dosage {{is based on the}} size of the patch, since, in general, the transdermal absorption rate is constant at a constant skin temperature. Rate of absorption is dependent on a number of factors. Body temperature, skin type, amount <b>of</b> <b>body</b> <b>fat,</b> and placement of the patch can have major effects. The different delivery systems used by different makers will also affect individual rates of absorption. Under normal circumstances, the patch will reach its full effect within 12 to 24 hours; thus, fentanyl patches are often prescribed with a fast-acting opiate (such as morphine or oxycodone) to handle breakthrough pain.|$|E
50|$|The extent <b>of</b> {{saponification}} <b>of</b> <b>body</b> <b>fats</b> in {{the remaining}} breast and thigh tissue of the victim, {{in conjunction with the}} continuous presence of heat generated by maggot infestation, led Dr. Simpson to revise the length of time the victim had lain undiscovered to one month, meaning the victim had died in early- to mid-September. Moreover, the extensive infestation of maggots indicated she had lain exposed to the elements for a minimum of 24 hours before her murderer had buried her body.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was the {{evaluation}} of measures <b>of</b> total <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> and distribution <b>of</b> adipose tissue, including the new conicity index, and their correlation with total <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> (in kg and %) estimated {{by means of the}} impedance method. Moreover, attention was paid to the bilateral differentiation of fat distribution. The basis for the analyses and comparisons was a group of 186 females of various age.
