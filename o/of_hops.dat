5|$|The first {{historical}} {{mention of}} the use <b>of</b> <b>hops</b> in beer was from 822 AD in monastery rules written by Adalhard the Elder, also known as Adalard of Corbie, though the date normally given for widespread cultivation <b>of</b> <b>hops</b> for use in beer is the thirteenth century. Before the thirteenth century, and until the sixteenth century, during which hops took over as the dominant flavouring, beer was flavoured with other plants; for instance, grains of paradise or alehoof. Combinations of various aromatic herbs, berries, and even ingredients like wormwood would be combined into a mixture known as gruit and used as hops are now used. Some beers today, such as Fraoch' by the Scottish Heather Ales company and Cervoise Lancelot by the French Brasserie-Lancelot company, use plants other than hops for flavouring.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe Hsp 70 –Hsp 90 {{complex is}} {{implicated in the}} folding and {{regulation}} of numerous signaling proteins, and Hop, the Hsp 70 –Hsp 90 Organizing Protein, facilitates the association of this multichaperone machinery. Phosphatase treatment of mouse cell extracts reduced the number <b>of</b> <b>Hop</b> isoforms compared to untreated extracts, providing the first direct evidence that Hop was phosphorylated in vivo. Furthermore, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy showed that a cdc 2 kinase phosphorylation mimic <b>of</b> <b>Hop</b> had reduced affinity for Hsp 90 binding. Hop was predominantly cytoplasmic, but translocated to the nucleus in response to heat shock. A putative bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) has been identified within the Hsp 90 -binding domain <b>of</b> <b>Hop.</b> Although substitution <b>of</b> residues within the major arm of this proposed NLS abolished Hop–Hsp 90 interaction as determined by SPR, this was not sufficient to prevent the nuclear accumulation <b>of</b> <b>Hop</b> under leptomycin-B treatment and heat shock conditions. These results showed {{for the first time}} that the subcellular localization <b>of</b> <b>Hop</b> was stress regulated and that the major arm of the putative NLS was not directly important for nuclear translocation but was critical for Hop–Hsp 90 association in vitro. We propose a model in which the association <b>of</b> <b>Hop</b> with Hsp 90 and the phosphorylated status <b>of</b> <b>Hop</b> both play a role in the mechanism of nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling <b>of</b> <b>Hop...</b>|$|R

5|$|Beer is {{the oldest}} and most widely {{consumed}} alcoholic drink in the world, and the third most popular drink overall after water and tea. Beer is brewed from cereal grains — most commonly from malted barley, though wheat, maize (corn), and rice are also used. During the brewing process, fermentation of the starch sugars in the wort produces ethanol and carbonation in the resulting beer. Most modern beer is brewed with hops, which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural preservative and stabilizing agent. Other flavouring agents such as gruit, herbs, or fruits may be included or used instead <b>of</b> <b>hops.</b> In commercial brewing, the natural carbonation effect is often removed during processing and replaced with forced carbonation.|$|E
5|$|That hops {{could be}} used for {{flavoring}} beer had been known at least since Carolingian times, but was adopted gradually due to difficulties in establishing the appropriate proportions. Before the widespread use <b>of</b> <b>hops,</b> gruit, a mix of various herbs, had been used. Gruit had the same preserving properties as hops, though less reliable depending on what herbs were in it, and the end result was much more variable. Another flavoring method was to increase the alcohol content, but this was more expensive and lent the beer the undesired characteristic of being a quick and heavy intoxicant. Hops may have been widely used in England in the tenth century; they were grown in Austria by 1208 and in Finland by 1249, and possibly much earlier.|$|E

5|$|This rockfowl feeds {{primarily}} on insects, though some plant matter, such as fruit and flower buds, is eaten. One feeding strategy involves following Dorylus army ant swarms, feeding on insects flushed by the ants. Rockfowl {{move through the}} forest mainly through a series <b>of</b> <b>hops</b> and bounds, or short flights in low vegetation. It travels either alone or in small groups. This species rarely flies for long distances. The grey-necked rockfowl is monogamous and pairs nest either alone or {{in the vicinity of}} other pairs, sometimes in colonies of two to five nests, though one colony of forty nests has been recorded. These nests are constructed out of mud and are formed into a deep cup that is built on rock surfaces, typically in caves or on cliffs. Two eggs are laid twice a year. Though the birds breed in colonies, infanticide exists in this species, with rockfowl attempting to kill the young of other pairs. Nestlings mature in about a month.|$|E

25|$|The {{transition}} from gruit to hops throughout Europe in the Middle Ages was a piecemeal, region-by-region process that lasted at least 500 years. It took time for farmers {{to learn of}} the existence <b>of</b> <b>hops,</b> how to farm them, when to cultivate them, and their value in brewing beer. Brewers had to learn the favourable and unfavourable characteristics <b>of</b> <b>hops,</b> {{and how to use}} hops to craft commercially successful beer. Even in the Middle Ages beer was an international commodity, and major brewing cities developed distinctive styles and reputations. Brewers had to consider the marketability of their beer, and competition from imports. Furthermore, regulations limited brewing ingredients in some jurisdictions. Even when a monarch permitted hop brewing, the hops might be taxed. What steps John took to institute hops in Flemish brewing is not documented, but he lived during a time when hops were being legalised in nearby jurisdictions. He was age 20 or 21 in 1392, when Duke Albert I granted the Dutch cities of Haarlem and Gouda permission to brew beer with hops.|$|E

40|$|In {{contrast}} to determination <b>of</b> <b>hop</b> utilisation {{in terms of}} beer bitterness, analytical measurement of the yield <b>of</b> <b>hop</b> aromatisation is not straightforward {{on account of the}} enormous chemical complexity <b>of</b> <b>hop</b> essential oil and hoppy aroma derived thereof. In this paper, selective determination <b>of</b> <b>hop</b> oil-derived constituents in the flavour profile of pilsner beer is achieved through headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Highly enriched floral and spicy hop essences were prepared by density programmed supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), followed by solid phase extraction (SPE), and subsequently added in well-defined amounts to an experimental pilsner, exclusively bittered with purified iso-α-acids extract. In view of reliable measurement of the yield of aromatisation of the pilsner with the respective hop oil fractions, characteristic marker components for the floral and spicy SFE/ SPE hop essences, respectively, were selected. Reliable determination of the selected markers for floral and spicy SFE/SPE hop essences in the aromatised beers turned out to be possible on condition that HS-SPME is combined with GC-MS comprising selected fragment ion monitoring (SIM). Using this approach, application <b>of</b> <b>hop</b> oil preparations can be monitored analytically, allowing improved control and specification <b>of</b> <b>hop</b> aromatisation according to the desired beer flavour. The average yield of beer aromatisation using floral and spicy hop essences was determined at about 95 %. On the basis of their sesquiterpenoid GC-MS/SIM pattern, fresh commercial lager beers could be differentiated, which may be useful for brand fingerprinting and identification. Upon forced ageing of the beers, levels <b>of</b> <b>hop</b> oil-derived sesquiterpenoids, in particular of caryophyllene and humulene epoxides, decrease significantly. In addition, trans-nerolidol is identified as a potential marker for measuring flavour (in) stability of pilsner beer. status: publishe...|$|R
25|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, the brewing {{industry}} in northern Europe {{changed from a}} small-scale domestic industry to a large-scale export industry. The key innovation was the introduction <b>of</b> <b>hops,</b> which began in northern Germany in the 13th century. Hops sharply improved both the brewing process {{and the quality of}} beer. Other innovations from German lands involved larger kettle sizes and more frequent brewing. Consumption went up, while brewing became more concentrated because it was a capital-intensive industry. Thus in Hamburg per capita consumption increased from an average of 300 liters per year in the 15th century to about 700 in the 17th century.|$|E
25|$|The {{advantages}} of supercritical fluid extraction (compared with liquid extraction) {{are that it}} is relatively rapid because of the low viscosities and high diffusivities associated with supercritical fluids. The extraction can be selective to some extent by controlling {{the density of the}} medium, and the extracted material is easily recovered by simply depressurizing, allowing the supercritical fluid to return to gas phase and evaporate leaving little or no solvent residues. Carbon dioxide is the most common supercritical solvent. It is used on a large scale for the decaffeination of green coffee beans, the extraction <b>of</b> <b>hops</b> for beer production, and the production of essential oils and pharmaceutical products from plants. A few laboratory test methods include the use of supercritical fluid extraction as an extraction method instead of using traditional solvents.|$|E

Early oast houses were simply adapted barns but, by the 18th Century, the distinctive tall buildings with conical roofs had been developed to increase the draught. At first these were square but around 1800 roundel kilns were developed {{in the belief that}} they were more efficient. Square kilns remained more popular in Hereford and Worcester and came back into fashion in the south east in the later 19th Century. In the 1930s, the cowls were replaced by louvred openings as electric fans and diesel oil ovens were employed.|$|E
