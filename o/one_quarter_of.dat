5|$|A {{direct grant}} grammar {{school was a}} type of {{selective}} secondary school in England and Wales that existed between 1945 and 1976. <b>One</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> the places in these schools were directly funded by central government, while the remainder attracted fees, some paid by the Local Education Authority and some by private pupils. On average, the schools received just over half of their income from the state.|$|E

He came into contact with Jews on a regular basis; as a small boy, he was tutored by a Jewish schoolmistress, and had learned to recite the Ten Commandments in the original Hebrew.|$|E
5|$|Like {{several other}} large tyrannosaurids, Tarbosaurus is known from {{relatively}} abundant and well-preserved fossil material. In fact, <b>one</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> all fossils {{collected from the}} Nemegt Formation belong to Tarbosaurus. Although Tarbosaurus has not been studied as thoroughly as the North American tyrannosaurids, the available material has allowed scientists to draw limited conclusions about its biology.|$|E

5|$|After {{the battle}} ended, while Stark's militiamen were busy disarming the prisoners and looting their supplies, Breymann arrived with his reinforcements. Seeing the Americans in disarray, they {{immediately}} pressed their attack. After hastily regrouping, Stark's forces {{tried to hold}} their ground against the new German onslaught, but began to fall back. Before their lines collapsed, Warner's men {{arrived on the scene}} to reinforce Stark's troops. Pitched battle continued until dark, when both sides disengaged. Breymann began a hasty retreat; he had lost <b>one</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> his force and all of his artillery pieces.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{restoration}} of the top three locks at Woolsthorpe in the 1990s, a 10-mile (16-km) section from the A1 to Redmile will be completed once the bottom four locks of the flight are restored. The rebuilding of locks 6 and 7, completed in 2000, brought the number of locks restored to five, and approximately <b>one</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> the canal has been restored to navigable standard. Much improvement of the towpath has also taken place, and access to it is possible at most of the bridges.|$|E
5|$|Hugh Mercer, {{leading the}} American advance guard, {{encountered}} British soldiers from Princeton {{under the command}} of Charles Mawhood. The British troops engaged Mercer and in the ensuing battle, Mercer was mortally wounded. Washington sent reinforcements under General John Cadwalader, which were successful in driving Mawhood and the British from Princeton, with many of them fleeing to Cornwallis in Trenton. The British lost more than <b>one</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> their force in the battle, and American morale rose with the victory.|$|E

5|$|Roughly <b>one</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> all zinc {{output in}} the United States in 2009 was {{consumed}} in zinc compounds; {{a variety of}} which are used industrially. Zinc oxide is widely used as a white pigment in paints and as a catalyst {{in the manufacture of}} rubber to disburse heat. Zinc oxide is used to protect rubber polymers and plastics from ultraviolet radiation (UV). The semiconductor properties of zinc oxide make it useful in varistors and photocopying products. The zinc zinc-oxide cycle is a two step thermochemical process based on zinc and zinc oxide for hydrogen production.|$|E

5|$|The {{headwaters}} of the Snake River and the high mountains elsewhere in the watershed were historically heavily forested. These include aspen, Douglas fir, and spruce fir, comprising about 20% of the historic watershed. At the base of mountains and in the Lost River basin, sagebrush was and is the predominant vegetation cover. Because of deforestation, up to <b>one</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> the forests have {{been taken over by}} sagebrush, leaving the remaining forests to cover about 15% of the watershed. However, the lodgepole pine has increased in number, taking over historic stands of other conifers. There are also up to 118 species of rare or endemic plants that occur in the Snake River watershed.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of shark fisheries have little monitoring or management. The rise {{in demand for}} shark products increases pressure on fisheries. Major declines in shark stocks have been recorded—some species have been depleted by over 90% over the past 20–30 years with population declines of 70% not unusual. A study by the International Union for Conservation of Nature suggests that <b>one</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> all known species of sharks and rays are threatened by extinction and 25 species were classified as critically endangered.|$|E
5|$|The {{monument}} supports 7,000 species, <b>one</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> {{which are}} endemic. Prominent species include the endangered hawksbill sea turtle, the threatened {{green sea turtle}} and the endangered Hawaiian monk seal, the Laysan and Nihoa finches, the Nihoa millerbird, Laysan duck, seabirds such as the Laysan albatross, numerous species of plants including Pritchardia palms, and many species of arthropods. According to the Pew Charitable Trusts, populations of lobster have not recovered from extensive harvesting in the 1980s and 1990s, which is now banned; the remaining fisheries are overfished.|$|E
5|$|A {{widely used}} alloy which {{contains}} zinc is brass, in which copper is alloyed with anywhere from 3% to 45% zinc, {{depending upon the}} type of brass. Brass is generally more ductile and stronger than copper and has superior corrosion resistance. These properties make it useful in communication equipment, hardware, musical instruments, and water valves. Other widely used alloys that contain zinc include nickel silver, typewriter metal, soft and aluminium solder, and commercial bronze. Alloys of primarily zinc with small amounts of copper, aluminium, and magnesium are useful in die casting as well as spin casting, especially in the automotive, electrical, and hardware industries. These alloys are marketed under the name Zamak. Roughly <b>one</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> all zinc output, in the United States (2009), is consumed {{in the form of}} zinc compounds, a variety of which are used industrially.|$|E
