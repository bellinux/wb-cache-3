40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} Multi Band OFDM based UWB wireless personal area networks (WPANs) over time varying channels. We first improve {{the efficiency of}} the data link layer. In order to maximize the link efficiency, we consider an immediate acknowlegement policy with dynamically and optimally selected frame sizes based on channel conditions. We then propose an opportunistic multiple-link-time scheduling algorithm, where the network controller determines the time allocation of individual connections within the IEEE 802. 15. 3 WPAN superframe structure. This algorithm determines time allocations proportional to the instantaneous efficiencies of <b>operating</b> <b>links.</b> Simulation results show that the proposed access method enhances the overall network performance compared to equal channel access schemes...|$|E
40|$|Transparency {{has become}} the panacea for central bank aliments. It is offered as a cure-all {{solution}} for deficiencies in accountability, credibility and communications. The paper by Jonny Nieson and Hans Dillon follows this line of argument. The authors define transparency {{in the context of}} Sweden’s experience with inflation targets around two central issues. Transparency is first defined as a communications device to spell out publicly the Riksbank’s intentions. The cloudy <b>operating</b> <b>links</b> of monetary policy are explained through the instruments of openness (forecasts, inflation report, instrument path, etc.). Transparency’s second function in this paper is credibility enhancement. The authors argue that through the central bank’s openness and rhetoric, the Riksbank eliminates the potential inflation biases, expectations are altered and policy becomes more effective. Below I will offer some remarks on the slippery concept of transparency and its role in monetary policy. 1. 0 Transparency Is transparency always needed? I would argue that different types of monetary regimes require different levels of transparency. Monetary rules based on outcomes (inflation or nominal incom...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{test methods}} and {{analysis}} tools are demonstrated to assess particle-induced bit errors on fiber optic link receivers for satellites. Susceptibility to direct ionization from low LET particles is quantified by analyzing proton and helium ion data {{as a function}} of particle LET. Existing single event analysis approaches are shown to apply, with appropriate modifications, to the regime of temporally (rather than spatially) distributed bits, even though the sensitivity to single events exceeds conventional memory technologies by orders of magnitude. The cross-section LET dependence follows a Weibull distribution at data rates from 200 to 1000 Mbps and at various incident optical power levels. The LET threshold for errors is shown, through both experiment and modeling, to be 0 in all cases! The error cross-section exhibits a strong inverse dependence on received optical power in the LET range where most orbital single events would occur, thus indicating that errors can be minimized by <b>operating</b> <b>links</b> with higher incident optical power. Also, an analytic model is described which incorporates the appropriate physical characteristics of the link as well as the optical and receiver electrical characteristics. Results indicate appropriate steps to assure suitable link performance even in severe particle orbits. I...|$|E

40|$|Mobile {{voice service}} is already {{considered}} a necessity by many, and mobile data, video, and TV services are now becoming {{an essential part}} of consumers' lives. The number of mobile subscribers is growing rapidly and bandwidth demand due to data and video services is increasing. There is a need for capacity to increase in order for mobile broadband, data access, and video services to engage the end consumer. Device-to-device (D 2 D) communications underlaying cellular networks entails the ability of a cellular network to allow devices to communicate directly with each other in the operating (licensed) spectrum of the cellular network. With the application of specific rules and strategies, D 2 D communications offloads the mobile network and increases the spectral efficiency. In this thesis we developed a method for the application of D 2 D communication, controlled by a cellular network. By deriving the theoretical upper bound on the interference we have analytically derived equations describing the minimum distances to be maintained between simultaneously <b>operating</b> <b>links,</b> to achieve a given minimum SINR. We devised a strategy to group and schedule links which fulfill these minimum requirements, so that multiple links may operate simultaneously. We describe a power optimization method to minimize the number of groups to further improve the efficiency of the occupation of resources. Finally we performed simulations for various D 2 D scenarios, including a scenario representing a realistic urban environment, to illustrate the potential of this grouping and scheduling strategy.

40|$|In {{the paper}} we address traffic {{engineering}} problems related to optimization of routing in IP networks applying destination-based shortest path routing (SPR) of the OSPF type. An SPR routing pattern is determined by a system of (administrative) weights defined over the set of IP links: the routes for IP forwarding are determined as the shortest paths computed locally at the nodes using the current link weights. When the shortest path from a certain node (node v, say) to a particular destination (destination t, say) is not unique, the traffic routed from node v to destination t is split equally among all links outgoing from v that belong to the shortest paths to destination t, i. e., according to the Equal Cost Multiple-Paths (ECMP) rule. The basic problem considered in this paper consists in finding a resilient link weight system generating a routing scheme that satisfies given traffic demands and {{does not lead to}} link overloads both in the normal network state of operation and in all considered failure states when certain IP links are failed. We assume that if a failure occurs then the weight system is modified by assigning infinite weights to the failed links, and not altering the weights of the remaining, <b>operating</b> <b>links.</b> We consider the traffic engineering goal related to minimization, over all failure states, of the maximal link overload. We formulate the considered problem as a mixed integer programme (MIP) and propose a heuristic algorithm based on the tabu search meta-heuristic. The efficiency of the proposed weight optimization method is illustrated by means of a numerical study...|$|E
40|$|Methods {{for solving}} {{partitioned}} mathematical programming problems require that an appropriate structure suitable for decomposition be identified. This first step consists of identifying linking variables that effect independent subproblems coordinated by a master problem. This article presents a network reliability-based {{solution of the}} optimal decomposition problem that avoids subjective criteria to identify linking variables and partitions. The relationships among design variables are modeled as the processing units of a network. The design variables themselves are modeled as the communication links between these units. The optimal decomposition is attained by minimizing the network reliability while maximizing the number of <b>operating</b> <b>links.</b> NOMENCLATURE (0 i, e) = (e 1,, e i - 1, 0, e i + 1,, e m) (1 i, e) = (e 1,, e i - 1, 1, e i + 1,, e m) E = vector of state random variables: E i for each ith edge e = vector of binary state variables: e i for each ith edge E(G) = set of edges in graph G E[X]= expected value of random variable X f = objective function A = all-terminal network state PC = network resilience NESTOR F.
