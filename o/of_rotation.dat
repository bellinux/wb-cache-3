5|$|Degenerate {{stars have}} {{contracted}} into a compact mass, {{resulting in a}} rapid rate <b>of</b> <b>rotation.</b> However they have relatively low rates <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> compared to what would be expected by conservation of angular momentum—the tendency of a rotating body to compensate for a contraction in size by increasing its rate of spin. A {{large portion of the}} star's angular momentum is dissipated as a result of mass loss through the stellar wind. In spite of this, the rate <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> for a pulsar can be very rapid. The pulsar {{at the heart of the}} Crab nebula, for example, rotates 30 times per second. The rotation rate of the pulsar will gradually slow due to the emission of radiation.|$|E
5|$|Each {{night the}} {{positions}} of the stars appear to change as the Earth rotates. However, when a star is located along the Earth's axis <b>of</b> <b>rotation,</b> it will remain in the same position and thus is called a pole star. The direction of the Earth's axis <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> gradually changes over time in a process known as the precession of the equinoxes. A complete precession cycle requires 25,770years, during which time the pole of the Earth's rotation follows a circular path across the celestial sphere that passes near several prominent stars. At present the pole star is Polaris, but around 12,000 BC the pole was pointed only five degrees away from Vega. Through precession, the pole will again pass near Vega around AD 14,000. It is the brightest of the successive northern pole stars.|$|E

5|$|A {{planet that}} can sustain life is termed habitable, even if life did not {{originate}} there. Earth provides liquid water—an environment where complex organic molecules can assemble and interact, and sufficient energy to sustain metabolism. The distance of Earth from the Sun, {{as well as}} its orbital eccentricity, rate <b>of</b> <b>rotation,</b> axial tilt, geological history, sustaining atmosphere, and magnetic field all contribute to the current climatic conditions at the surface.|$|E
5|$|Altair rotates rapidly, with a {{velocity}} at {{the equator}} of approximately 286km/s. This {{is a significant}} fraction of the star's estimated breakup speed of 400km/s. A study with the Palomar Testbed Interferometer revealed that Altair is not spherical, but is flattened at the poles due to its high rate <b>of</b> <b>rotation.</b> Other interferometric studies with multiple telescopes, operating in the infrared, have imaged and confirmed this phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the members}} of a close binary system raises tides on the other through {{gravitational}} interaction. However the bulges can be slightly misaligned with respect to the direction of gravitational attraction. Thus the force of gravity produces a torque component on the bulge, resulting in the transfer of angular momentum (tidal acceleration). This causes the system to steadily evolve, although it can approach a stable equilibrium. The effect can be more complex in cases where the axis <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> is not perpendicular to the orbital plane.|$|E

5|$|Earth's axis <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> is tilted, {{producing}} {{seasonal variations}} on the planet's surface. The gravitational interaction between the Earth and Moon causes ocean tides, stabilizes the Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation.

5|$|From {{the surface}} of Mars, the motions of Phobos and Deimos appear {{different}} from that of the Moon. Phobos rises in the west, sets in the east, and rises again in just 11 hours. Deimos, being only just outside synchronous orbit – where the orbital period would match the planet's period <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> – rises as expected in the east but slowly. Despite the 30-hour orbit of Deimos, 2.7 days elapse between its rise and set for an equatorial observer, as it slowly falls behind the rotation of Mars.|$|E
5|$|Ida's {{rotation}} period is 4.63 hours, {{making it one}} of the fastest rotating asteroids yet discovered. The calculated maximum moment of inertia of a uniformly dense object the same shape as Ida coincides with the spin axis of the asteroid. This suggests that there are no major variations of density within the asteroid. Ida's axis <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> precesses with a period of 77 thousand years, due to the gravity of the Sun acting upon the nonspherical shape of the asteroid.|$|E

30|$|We now {{consider}} the hexagonal lattice. This case {{is different from}} the square lattice because it seems from Proposition  3.6 that only counterclockwise pinwheels are center <b>of</b> <b>rotations.</b> However, it turns out that γ as in Lemma  3.4 is a rotation on the torus, hence yielding the other pinwheels as center <b>of</b> <b>rotations.</b>|$|R

5|$|Medicinal plants demand {{intensive}} management. Different species each require {{their own}} distinct conditions of cultivation. The World Health Organization recommends the use <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> to minimise problems with pests and plant diseases. Cultivation may be traditional or may {{make use of}} conservation agriculture practices to maintain organic matter in the soil and to conserve water, for example with no-till farming systems. In many medicinal and aromatic plants, plant characteristics vary widely with soil type and cropping strategy, so care is required to obtain satisfactory yields.|$|E
5|$|The Watts Brothers Tool Works square {{drill bit}} has {{the shape of}} a Reuleaux triangle, {{modified}} with concavities to form cutting surfaces. When mounted in a special chuck which allows for the bit not having a fixed centre <b>of</b> <b>rotation,</b> it can drill a hole that is nearly square. Although patented by Henry Watts in 1914, similar drills invented by others were used earlier. Other Reuleaux polygons are used to drill pentagonal, hexagonal, and octagonal holes.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnetic}} field {{of a star}} interacts with the stellar wind. As the wind {{moves away from the}} star its rate of angular velocity slows. The {{magnetic field}} of the star interacts with the wind, which applies a drag to the stellar rotation. As a result, angular momentum is transferred from the star to the wind, and over time this gradually slows the star's rate <b>of</b> <b>rotation.</b>|$|E

50|$|Products <b>of</b> <b>{{rotation}}s</b> give another rotation (a frequent exemplification of a subgroup), while {{products of}} boosts and boosts or <b>of</b> <b>rotations</b> and boosts cannot be expressed as pure boosts or pure rotations. In general, any Lorentz transformation {{can be expressed}} as a product <b>of</b> a pure <b>rotation</b> and a pure boost. For more background see (for example) B.R. Durney (2011) and H.L. Berk et al. and references therein.|$|R
5|$|The {{method of}} Foucault replaces the {{cogwheel}} by a rotating mirror. Because the mirror keeps rotating while the light {{travels to the}} distant mirror and back, the light is reflected from the rotating mirror at a different angle on its way out than it {{is on its way}} back. From this difference in angle, the known speed <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> and the distance to the distant mirror the speed of light may be calculated.|$|E
5|$|The {{rotation}} {{of a star}} causes a Doppler shift to the spectrum. On average, {{this results in a}} broadening of the absorption lines in its spectrum, with the lines increasing in width with higher rates <b>of</b> <b>rotation.</b> However, only the rotational motion {{in the direction of the}} observer can be measured by this means, so the resulting data provides a lower limit on the star's rotation. This projected rotational velocity of Wolf 359's equator is less than 3 km/s, which is below the threshold of detection through spectral line broadening. This low rate <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> may have been caused by loss of angular momentum through a stellar wind. Typically, the time scale for the spin down of a star at spectral class M6 is roughly 10 billion years, because fully convective stars like this lose their rotation more slowly than other stars. However, evolutionary models suggest that Wolf 359 is a relatively young star with an age of less than a billion years.|$|E
5|$|The {{rotation}} {{of a star}} produces an equatorial bulge due to centrifugal force. As stars are not solid bodies, they can also undergo differential rotation. Thus the equator of the star can rotate at a different angular velocity than the higher latitudes. These differences in the rate <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> within a star may have {{a significant role in}} the generation of a stellar magnetic field.|$|E
50|$|The {{above-mentioned}} Euler vector is the eigenvector <b>of</b> a <b>rotation</b> matrix (a rotation matrix has {{a unique}} real eigenvalue).
