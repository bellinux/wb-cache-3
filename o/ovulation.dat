5|$|The {{degree of}} <b>ovulation</b> {{suppression}} in progestogen-only contraceptives {{depends on the}} progestogen activity and dose. Low dose progestogen-only contraceptives—traditional progestogen only pills, subdermal implants Norplant and Jadelle, and intrauterine system Mirena—inhibit <b>ovulation</b> in about 50% of cycles and rely mainly on other effects, such as thickening of cervical mucus, for their contraceptive effectiveness. Intermediate dose progestogen-only contraceptives—the progestogen-only pill Cerazette and the subdermal implant Nexplanon—allow some follicular development but more consistently inhibit <b>ovulation</b> in 97–99% of cycles. The same cervical mucus changes occur as with very low-dose progestogens. High-dose, progestogen-only contraceptives—the injectables Depo-Provera and Noristerat—completely inhibit follicular development and <b>ovulation.</b>|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to determine the number of <b>ovulations</b> in culled Landrace × Yorkshire (LY) crossbred gilts in the tropics associated with age, body weight and growth rate. The genital organs from 316 gilts were examined for gross abnormalities, and those with normal cyclic ovaries (n= 155, 307 ± 4. 1 days of age, 148 ± 1. 6 kg body weight) were included in the analyses. Number of <b>ovulations</b> was defined by a count of the corpora lutea (CL) from both ovaries. On average, the number of <b>ovulations</b> in LY gilts was 15. 9 ± 0. 3 (range 4 to 27). The number of <b>ovulations</b> correlated with the body weight (r= 0. 31, P 0. 05). Gilts with a body weight of 141 to 150 kg (17. 0 CL, n= 31) ovulated more than those with a body weight ≤ 130 kg (14. 1 CL, P= 0. 014, n= 23). In conclusion, both the body weight and growth rate of the gilts were significantly correlated with the number of <b>ovulations.</b> The maximum number of <b>ovulations</b> was found in gilts at a body weight of above 141 kg...|$|R
40|$|The role {{of steroids}} in the ovulatory {{process of the}} rat was {{explored}} in an in vitro perfusion system. lm,nature rat ovaries were primed with pregnant mare’s serum gonadotropin (20 IU) and perfused in a recirculating perfusion system for up to 20 h. Unstimulated ovaries did not ovulate whereas the addition of luteinizing hormone (LII; 0. 1 p. g/ml) plus 3 -ssobutyl-I-met hylxanthine (IBMX; 02 mM) resulted in 13. 6 ± 1. 0 <b>ovulations</b> per treated ovary. Addition of an inhibitor of 3 f 3 -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (Compound A; 10 p. gIml) significantly (p 3000 nglml) did not significantly (p>O. 05) increase the nwnber of <b>ovulations</b> after stimulation with LII plus JBMX (20. 2 ± 4. 8 <b>ovulations),</b> and progesterone (> 3000 ng/ml) was not by itself able to induce <b>ovulations.</b> Addition of LII plus JBMX resulted in a marked increase in the levels of progesterone, testosterone, and estradiol in the perfusion medium. The production of these steroids was almost completely inhibited {{by the addition of}} Compound A, and the levels of testosterone and est radio! were restored by the addition of high concentrations of progesterone. The levels of cyclic adenosine 3 ’S’-monophosphate increased after addition of LH plus IBMX and were not changed by the presence of Compound A. It is concluded that progesterone plays an important mediatory role in ZR-induced <b>ovulations,</b> but that progesterone by itself is not capable of inducing <b>ovulations</b> in the in vitro-perfused rat ovary...|$|R
5|$|Breastfeeding causes {{negative}} feedback to occur on pulse secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Depending {{on the strength}} of the {{negative feedback}}, breastfeeding women may experience complete suppression of follicular development, but no <b>ovulation,</b> or normal menstrual cycle may resume. Suppression of <b>ovulation</b> is more likely when suckling occurs more frequently. The production of prolactin in response to suckling is important to maintaining lactational amenorrhea. On average, women who are fully breastfeeding whose infants suckle frequently experience a return of menstruation at fourteen and a half months postpartum. There is a wide range of response among individual breastfeeding women, however, with some experiencing return of menstruation at two months and others remaining amenorrheic for up to 42 months postpartum.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the risk}} factors for endometrial cancer involve high levels of estrogens. An {{estimated}} 40% of cases {{are thought to be}} related to obesity. In obesity, the excess of adipose tissue increases conversion of androstenedione into estrone, an estrogen. Higher levels of estrone in the blood causes less or no <b>ovulation</b> and exposes the endometrium to continuously high levels of estrogens. Obesity also causes less estrogen to be removed from the blood. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which also causes irregular or no <b>ovulation,</b> is associated with higher rates of endometrial cancer for the same reasons as obesity. Specifically, obesity, typeII diabetes, and insulin resistance are risk factors for TypeI endometrial cancer. Obesity increases the risk for endometrial cancer by 300–400%.|$|E
5|$|Only {{a single}} Tyrannosaurus rex {{specimen}} has been conclusively shown {{to belong to}} a specific sex. Examination of B-rex demonstrated the preservation of soft tissue within several bones. Some of this tissue has been identified as a medullary tissue, a specialized tissue grown only in modern birds as a source of calcium for the production of eggshell during <b>ovulation.</b> As only female birds lay eggs, medullary tissue is only found naturally in females, although males are capable of producing it when injected with female reproductive hormones like estrogen. This strongly suggests that B-rex was female, and that she died during <b>ovulation.</b> Recent research has shown that medullary tissue is never found in crocodiles, which are thought to be the closest living relatives of dinosaurs, aside from birds. The shared presence of medullary tissue in birds and theropod dinosaurs is further evidence of the close evolutionary relationship between the two.|$|E
2500|$|Though {{surgery is}} not {{commonly}} performed, the polycystic ovaries {{can be treated}} with a laparoscopic procedure called [...] "ovarian drilling" [...] (puncture of 4–10 small follicles with electrocautery, laser, or biopsy needles), which often results in either resumption of spontaneous <b>ovulations</b> or <b>ovulations</b> after adjuvant treatment with clomiphene or FSH. (Ovarian wedge resection is no longer used as much due to complications such as adhesions {{and the presence of}} frequently effective medications.) There are, however, concerns about the long-term effects of ovarian drilling on ovarian function.|$|R

5|$|After {{menstruation}} {{and directly}} {{under the influence of}} estrogen, the cervix undergoes a series of changes in position and texture. During most of the menstrual cycle, the cervix remains firm, and is positioned low and closed. However, as <b>ovulation</b> approaches, the cervix becomes softer and rises to open in response to the higher levels of estrogen present. These changes are also accompanied by changes in cervical mucus, described below.|$|E
5|$|Fertility {{awareness}} {{methods that}} rely on cycle length records alone are called calendar-based methods. Methods that require observation {{of one or more}} of the three primary fertility signs (basal body temperature, cervical mucus, and cervical position) are known as symptoms-based methods.

Computerized devices that interpret basal body temperatures, urinary test results, or changes in saliva are called fertility monitors.|$|E
5|$|In most rodent species, such as brown {{rats and}} house mice, <b>ovulation</b> occurs {{on a regular}} cycle while in others, such as voles, it is induced by mating.

5|$|Most lionesses {{will have}} {{reproduced}} {{by the time}} they are four years of age. Lions do not mate at any specific time of year, and the females are polyestrous. As with other cats' penises, the male lion's penis has spines that point backward. During withdrawal of the penis, the spines rake the walls of the female's vagina, which may cause <b>ovulation.</b> A lioness may mate with more than one male when she is in heat.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ovulation</b> is {{the second}} phase of the ovarian cycle in which a mature egg is {{released}} from the ovarian follicles into the oviduct. During the follicular phase, estradiol suppresses release of luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary gland. When the egg has nearly matured, levels of estradiol reach a threshold above which this effect is reversed and estrogen stimulates the production of a large amount of LH. This process, known as the LH surge, starts around day12 of the average cycle and may last 48 hours.|$|E
5|$|Several {{methods of}} {{contraception}} involve the cervix. Cervical diaphragms are reusable, firm-rimmed plastic devices inserted {{by a woman}} prior to intercourse that cover the cervix. Pressure against {{the walls of the}} vagina maintain the position of the diaphragm, and it acts as a physical barrier to prevent the entry of sperm into the uterus, preventing fertilisation. Cervical caps are a similar method, although they are smaller and adhere to the cervix by suction. Diaphragms and caps are often used in conjunction with spermicides. In one year, 12% of women using the diaphragm will undergo an unintended pregnancy, and with optimal use this falls to 6%. Efficacy rates are lower for the cap, with 18% of women undergoing an unintended pregnancy, and 10–13% with optimal use. Most types of progestogen-only pills are effective as a contraceptive because they thicken cervical mucus making it difficult for sperm to pass along the cervical canal. In addition, they may also sometimes prevent <b>ovulation.</b> In contrast, contraceptive pills that contain both oestrogen and progesterone, the combined oral contraceptive pills, work mainly by preventing <b>ovulation.</b> They also thicken cervical mucus and thin the lining of the uterus enhancing their effectiveness.|$|E
40|$|In isolated, perfused ovaries of rats {{treated with}} {{pregnant}} mare’s serum gonadotropin (PMSG), purified preparations of ovine follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (oFSH- 21 1 B) and rat FSH (rFSH-I- 6), 100 ng/ml, {{were found to}} induce <b>ovulations</b> (4. 8 ± 0. 9, nr 4, and 6. 4 ± 2. 0, n= 5, <b>ovulations</b> per ovary, respectively). In-domethacin (5 ig/mI) added to the perfusate inhibited this ovulatory effect and exogenous prostaglandin F 2 a (PGF 2 a) (1 ig/ml), or protaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) (0. 5. zg/ml), reversed the blockade. Ovine FSH and rFSH had only a weak stimulatory effect on estradiol release, and only rFSH caused {{a significant increase in}} pro-gesterone accumulation. Indomethacin reduced the stimulatory effect of rFSH on progesterone release, and this effect was reversed by PGE, but not by PGF 2 a In a 6 -h incubation experiment with preovulatory rat follicles, we tested the biological activity of gonadotropins used to induce oocyte maturation. The concentration of FSH used in the perfusion experiments induced oocyte maturation in more than 88 % of the oocytes studied. The data confirm earlier findings that FSH can induce <b>ovulations</b> and show that prostaglandins are involved in this process. The data also indicate that pro staglandins might be involved in the FSH-induced increase of progesterone levels...|$|R

5|$|The {{menstrual cycle}} can be {{described}} by the ovarian or uterine cycle.

5|$|The most fertile period (the {{time with}} the highest {{likelihood}} of pregnancy resulting from sexual intercourse) covers the time from some 5 days before until 1 to 2 days after <b>ovulation.</b> In a 28‑day cycle with a 14‑day luteal phase, this corresponds to the second {{and the beginning of}} the third week. A variety of methods have been developed to help individual women estimate the relatively fertile and the relatively infertile days in the cycle; these systems are called fertility awareness.|$|E
5|$|Females {{are sexually}} mature at {{seven to eight}} years old, and males at seven to 10 years. The {{beginning}} of a female's <b>ovulation</b> is {{a signal to the}} males that she is ready to mate. During <b>ovulation,</b> the skin of the female's anogenital area swells and turns a bright red/pink. The swelling makes it difficult to move and increases the female's chance of microbial or parasitic infection. Females with more swollen anogenital areas reproduce while younger, produce more offspring per year, and those offspring {{have a better chance of}} surviving. These females also attract more males, and are more likely to cause aggressive fights between them. Olive baboons tend to mate promiscuously. A male forms a mating consortship with an estrous female, staying close to and copulating with her. Males guard their partner against any other male trying to mate with her. Unless a female is in a multiday consortship, she often copulates with more than one male each day. Multiple copulations are not necessary for reproduction, but may function to make the actual paternity of the female's offspring ambiguous. This lack of paternal certainty could help reduce the occurrence of infanticide. Occasionally, male olive baboons monopolize a female for her entire period of probable conception. The male protects his female from being mated by other males during consortship.|$|E
40|$|Summary. Injections of {{progesterone}} {{were given}} to ewes to suppress ovarian cycles; {{pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin}} (pms) was adminis-tered within 2 days of the final injection of progesterone. Oestrus, numbers of <b>ovulations</b> and follicle growth were observed during the week following treatment. In some experiments, ewes were mated to fertile rams and fertility and fecundity were recorded. Experiments were carried out at different stages of the breeding season. Relationships between methods of suppression of ovarian cycles (dose and frequency of injections of progesterone) and methods of ovarian stimulation (dose and time of administration of pms in relation to the final progesterone injection) for each of the responses were examined. The most important finding was that for comparable dosage levels of pms, the numbers of <b>ovulations</b> were greater after progesterone injections on alternate days than after daily injections.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Maternal {{trisomy 21}} ovarian mosaicism might provide the major causative factor for fetal Down syndrome. The small {{proportion}} of trisomy 21 oocytes thought to be retarded in their maturation in comparison to normal disomic ones, and the maternal age effect can be based on an accumulation of trisomy 21 oocytes in the ovarian reserve. By lowering the number of unnecessary <b>ovulations,</b> a greater portion of disomic oocytes might be saved. STUDY DESIGN: Between September 2009 and September 2011, we performed genetic amniocentesis for fetal chromosomal analysis in 5222 pregnancies. We detected 119 structural or numerical chromosomal abnormalities. We collected data from 37 cases who were in advanced maternal age and where fetal trisomy 21, 18 or 13 was confirmed. We had 92 control patients. Detailed information was taken from those factors that influence the number of <b>ovulations</b> in reproductive life. RESULTS: From the factors checked, patients with a trisomic fetus had a shorter overall mean length of oral contraceptive pill use before the trisomic pregnancy (3. 4 vs. 6. 0 years, p<. 0014), and the estimated number of mean <b>ovulations</b> was higher (274. 6 vs. 224, p<. 0003). CONCLUSION: We found that a history of longer oral contraceptive pill use and fewer ovulatory cycles were associated with fewer common trisomies of the fetus.

5|$|In a dissenting opinion, a {{systematic}} review of four head-to-head comparative trials of metformin and clomifene found them equally effective for infertility. Four positive studies of metformin were in women not responding to clomifene, while {{the population in}} the negative studies was drug-naive or uncontrolled for the previous treatment. Metformin should be used as a second-line drug if clomifene treatment fails. Another review recommended metformin unreservedly as a first-line treatment option because it has positive effects not only on anovulation, but also on insulin resistance, hirsutism and obesity often associated with PCOS. A Cochrane Collaboration review found metformin improves <b>ovulation</b> and pregnancy rates, particularly when combined with clomifene, but is not associated with {{an increase in the number}} of live births.|$|E
5|$|In the tropics, many {{amphibians}} breed continuously or at {{any time}} of year. In temperate regions, breeding is mostly seasonal, usually in the spring, and is triggered by increasing day length, rising temperatures or rainfall. Experiments have shown the importance of temperature, but the trigger event, especially in arid regions, is often a storm. In anurans, males usually arrive at the breeding sites before females and the vocal chorus they produce may stimulate <b>ovulation</b> in females and the endocrine activity of males that are not yet reproductively active.|$|E
5|$|Loggerheads may display {{multiple}} paternity. Multiple paternity {{is possible}} due to sperm storage.

Multiple paternity and female size are positively correlated. Two hypotheses explain this correlation. One posits that males favor large females because of their perceived higher fecundity (ability to reproduce). The other states, because larger females are able to swim more quickly to mating grounds, they have longer mating periods.|$|E
40|$|A {{possible}} explanation for the compensatory increase in weight and function of the remaining ovary in the rat following hemiovariectomy is that gonado-trophin secretion increases due to reduced gonadal steroid levels. The observa-tion that increased amounts of exogenous gonadotrophins are required in hypophysectomized rats to increase the ovarian weight and numbers of <b>ovulations</b> in hemiovariectomized rats to the levels in intact rats (Greenwald, 1968) supports this theory. Efforts to detect changes in circulating gonado-trophin levels following hemiovariectomy in the rat have been only partially successful. Edgren, Parlow, Peterson & Jones (1965) were unable to detect changes in either FSH or LH following removal ofone ovary. Benson, Sorrentino & Evans (1969), however, reported that plasma FSH was elevated 4 days after hemiovariectomy. Since hemiovariectomy on the day of oestrus leads to a doubling of the number of <b>ovulations</b> at the subsequent oestrus (Peppler & Greenwald, 1970), changes in serum gonadotrophin levels should be evident during th...|$|R
