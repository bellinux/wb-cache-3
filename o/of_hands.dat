40|$|In {{most of the}} {{previous}} works on hand-based recognition methods, mostly, the significance was not given to the side <b>of</b> the <b>hand,</b> which {{is used in the}} model.

In this study, we investigated the effect of loss-of-function mutations in the filaggrin gene (FLG), atopic dermatitis and wet work exposure on the development <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> eczema in apprentice nurses. Dutch apprentice nurses were genotyped for the four most common FLG mutations; atopic dermatitis and hand eczema history were assessed by questionnaire. Exposure and hand eczema during traineeships were assessed with diary cards. The prevalence <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> eczema during traineeships was higher among subjects with a history <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> eczema reported at inclusion.

5|$|It was in {{the later}} medieval era that the borders of Scotland reached {{approximately}} their modern extent. The Isle of Man fell under English control in the 14th century, despite several attempts to restore Scottish authority. The English were able to annexe a large slice of the lowlands under Edward III, but these losses were gradually regained, particularly while England was preoccupied with the Wars of the Roses (1455–85). In 1468 the last great acquisition of Scottish territory occurred when James III married Margaret of Denmark, receiving the Orkney Islands and the Shetland Islands in payment of her dowry. However, in 1482 Berwick, a border fortress and the largest port in medieval Scotland, fell to the English once again, for {{what was to be}} the final change <b>of</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{embryonic}} individual of Dinocephalosaurus preserved inside LPV 30280 from Luoping can {{be identified}} as such for several reasons. First, it is enclosed entirely within the body cavity of the adult. Its cervical ribs - which are long, {{like that of the}} adult - face the same direction as the dorsal vertebrae of the adult, which is in contradiction to the typical head-first method of swallowing prey among amniotes. It is also preserved with its neck curling towards its forelimbs, a posture which is seen among vertebrate embryos but not adult Dinocephalosaurus specimens, which generally have the neck bent upwards. The absence <b>of</b> <b>hands</b> associated with the forelimbs in the embryo may be an artifact of preservation, but it may also be due to the sequence in which the limb bones of tetrapods ossify.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{estimate}} the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> eczema in hairdressers in Sweden. Methods: The occurrence <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> eczema was estimated in a Swedish longitudinal retrospective cohort study including all female graduates from vocational schools for hairdressers from 1970 to 1995. A stratified sample {{from the general}} population acted as controls. A self-administered questionnaire including questions on the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> eczema, skin atopy, working periods and number of hair treatments performed per week was sent to the participants. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> eczema were estimated. Results: The incidence rate <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> eczema in hairdressers was 23. 8 cases/ 1000 person-years, whereas in hairdressers who were aged, 25 years it was 37. 1 / 1000 person-years. The corresponding IRR for hairdressers compared with controls was 2. 5 (95 % confidence interval (Cl) 2. 2 to 2. 8), and that for younger hairdressers was 3. 1 (95 % Cl 2. 6 to 3. 5). The mean age at onset <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> eczema was 21. 6 years for hairdressers and 21. 2 years for controls. The 1 -year prevalence <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> eczema was 18. 0 % for hairdressers and 12. 1 % for controls. A large number of hair treatments involving exposure to skin irritants and sensitisers were reported. The incidence rate <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> eczema was higher among individuals with a history of childhood eczema, both for hairdressers and for controls, giving an (age-adjusted) IRR of 1. 9 and 2. 2, respectively. The attributable fraction <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> eczema from skin atopy was 9. 6 %. A synergistic effect of skin atopy and hairdressing was found on the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> eczema. The relative excess risk due to interaction was 1. 21 (95 % Cl 0. 21 to 2. 21; p = 0. 01). Conclusion: Hairdressers are highly exposed to skin-damaging substances. The self-reported incidence <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> eczema was substantially higher in female hairdressers than in controls {{from the general population}} and than that found previously in register-based studies. For many individuals, onset <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> eczema occurs early in life. Only about 10 % <b>of</b> the <b>hand</b> eczema cases among hairdressers would be prevented if no one with skin atopy entered the trade...|$|R

5|$|The royal touch (also {{known as}} the king's touch) {{was a form of}} laying on <b>of</b> <b>hands,</b> whereby French and English monarchs touched their subjects, {{regardless}} of social classes, with the intent to cure them of various diseases and conditions.

The disease rarely resulted in death and often went into remission on its own, giving the impression that the monarch's touch cured it. The claimed power was most notably exercised by monarchs who sought to demonstrate the legitimacy of their reign and of their newly founded dynasties.|$|E

Just as many viruses are very {{specific}} {{as to which}} host species or tissue they attack, each species of virus relies on a particular method for propagation. Plant viruses are often spread from plant to plant by insects and other organisms, known as vectors. Some viruses of animals, including humans, are spread by exposure to infected bodily fluids. Viruses such as influenza are spread through the air by droplets of moisture when people cough or sneeze. Viruses such as norovirus are transmitted by the faecal–oral route, which involves the contamination <b>of</b> <b>hands,</b> food and water. Rotavirus is often spread by direct contact with infected children. The human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, is transmitted by bodily fluids transferred during sex.

5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the second}} day, the Seimas adopted a four-{{paragraph}} resolution. The first paragraph declared that the Tsarist government was Lithuania's most dangerous enemy. The second paragraph demanded autonomy; the third outlined the means towards this goal that were deemed acceptable. The resistance was to be peaceful and passive. The fourth and final paragraph demanded that children be taught in their native language by teachers chosen by the people. The Seimas, unlike the 1917 Vilnius Conference, did not attempt to elect an institution that could carry out these resolutions and act as a Lithuanian government. After the Seimas, rural areas were left on their own without central guidance. After the resolution was adopted by the Seimas, near midnight, Jonas Basanavičius read aloud his proposal to include an attachment condemning Polish ecclesiastical authorities for suppressing the use of the Lithuanian language in churches within the diocese of Vilnius.

5|$|During sessions, {{members may}} speak after being called {{on by the}} President. Members of the Council or Commission may also attend and speak in debates. Partly due {{to the need for}} translation, and the {{politics}} of consensus in the chamber, debates tend to be calmer and more polite than, say, the Westminster system. Voting is conducted primarily by a show <b>of</b> <b>hands,</b> that may be checked on request by electronic voting. Votes of MEPs are not recorded in either case, however; that only occurs when there is a roll-call ballot. This is required for the final votes on legislation and also whenever a political group or 30 MEPs request it. The number of roll-call votes has increased with time. Votes can also be a completely secret ballot (for example, when the president is elected). All recorded votes, along with minutes and legislation, are recorded in the Official Journal of the European Union and can be accessed online. Votes usually do not follow a debate, but rather they are grouped with other due votes on specific occasions, usually at noon on Tuesdays, Wednesdays or Thursdays. This is because the length of the vote is unpredictable and if it continues for longer than allocated it can disrupt other debates and meetings later in the day.|$|E
