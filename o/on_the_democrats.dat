25|$|As the 1894 mid-term {{elections}} neared, Republicans {{were able}} to secure blame for the poor economic situation <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats,</b> and swept into power in the statehouse, taking strong majorities in both houses. The legislative districts created in 1890 were a subject of intense debate at the time; the legislature during the term of Governor Isaac P. Gray had created several gerrymander districts that favored Democrats. Republicans had contested the districting in the courts, who ruled the state must be redistricted. The Democrats had done so in 1893, but the Republicans overrode their redistricting upon taking power, and created their own plan which effectively reversed the situation and created pro-Republican gerrymander districts.|$|E
25|$|Based {{on these}} revelations, Texas A history {{professor}} Luke Nichter, who had successfully petitioned {{for the release}} of the information, argued that Woodward and Bernstein were incorrect in concluding, based largely on Watergate burglar James McCord's word, {{that the purpose of the}} break-in was to bug O'Brien's phone to gather political and financial intelligence <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats.</b> Instead, Nichter sided with late journalist J. Anthony Lukas of the New York Times, who had concluded that the committee was seeking to find evidence linking the Democrats to prostitution, as it was alleged that Oliver's office had been used to arrange such meetings. However, Nichter acknowledged that Woodward and Bernstein's theory of O'Brien as the target could not be debunked unless information was released about what Baldwin heard in his bugging of conversations.|$|E

500|$|Despite intense campaigning by Nixon, who reprised {{his strong}} attacks <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats,</b> the Republicans {{lost control of}} both houses of Congress in the 1954 elections. These losses caused Nixon to {{contemplate}} leaving politics once he had served out his term. On September 24, 1955, President Eisenhower suffered a heart attack; his condition was initially believed to be life-threatening. Eisenhower was unable to perform his duties for six weeks. The 25th Amendment to the United States Constitution {{had not yet been}} proposed, and the Vice President had no formal power to act. Nonetheless, Nixon acted in Eisenhower's stead during this period, presiding over Cabinet meetings and ensuring that aides and Cabinet officers did not seek power. According to Nixon biographer Stephen Ambrose, Nixon had [...] "earned the high praise he received for his conduct during the crisis... he made no attempt to seize power".|$|E

2500|$|All these {{negotiations}} fell through, due to delays in communication, {{time required to}} raise the money, and the December deadline for states to report their results. But the revelation of the attempts reflected poorly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats,</b> who lost some of the moral authority behind their argument that Tilden had been cheated out of the presidency. [...] In the 1878 elections, voter unhappiness with these revelations led to Republicans gaining eight U.S. House seats in New York, which undercut the argument that Tilden should be renominated in 1880 {{because he was the}} only candidate strong enough to carry the largest state in the Union for the Democrats. [...] Republicans also won the governorship of New York in 1879, further undercutting the argument that Tilden could carry New York in 1880.|$|E
