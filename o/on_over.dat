5|$|A {{company board}} member, Victor Coen, was {{convinced}} that the company had been treated wrongly and insisted in bringing it before the courts. In May 1929, he convinced the rest of the board to issue a writ against the syndicate and Oppenheimer, alleging fraudulent conspiracy, and began instructing Hastings. Hastings worried that the case would become unmanageable, with the syndicate relying <b>on</b> <b>over</b> 4,000 documents for their defence, but luckily found a certificate showing that the company profits, rather than the five percent Oppenheimer had reported, were in fact seventeen percent.|$|E

5|$|A {{study by}} {{researchers}} at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) found that growing sweet sorghum instead of grain sorghum could increase farmers incomes by US$40 per hectare per crop because it can provide food, feed and fuel. With grain sorghum currently grown <b>on</b> <b>over</b> 11 million hectares (ha) in Asia and on 23.4 million ha in Africa, a switch to sweet sorghum could have a considerable economic impact.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper aims {{to provide}} a {{comparison}} between the notion of T time <b>on</b> average <b>over</b> ranking of distributions, proposed by Reischuk and Schindelhauer (1993), {{and the notion of}} T time on average, proposed by Ben-David et al. (1992). The latter is a direct generalization of Levin's notion of average polynomial time (Levin, 1986). In particular, we show that for any problem D and any ranking function ρ, if ρ(D) is solvable in time T <b>on</b> average <b>over</b> a uniform distribution and ρ is computable in polynomial time, then Dis solvable in time T ο p + q <b>on</b> average <b>over</b> ρ, where p and q are polynomials depending on ρ. We then show that, under a randomized reduction, there is a complete problem (D,ρ) for distributional NP problems with respect to ranking such that ρ(D) ϵ NP and if ρ(D) is solvable in time T <b>on</b> average <b>over</b> a uniform distribution, then D is solvable in time T(O(n)) + p(n) <b>on</b> average <b>over</b> ρ, where p is the time bound for computing ρ. Hence, no NP problems averaging over ranking of distributions are harder than averaging over uniform distributions in the notions of polynomial-time or sub-exponential-time solvability. Finally, we show that there is a reasonable tight hierarchy for the notion of T time <b>on</b> average <b>over</b> uniform distributions...|$|R
