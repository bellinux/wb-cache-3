5|$|The church, {{designed}} in the Gothic revival style, is built from rubble masonry dressed with gritstone, and has a slate roof. There is a three-stage tower with buttresses at the base at {{the west end of}} the building, topped with a spire. The tower has <b>one</b> <b>window</b> in the west wall in the lowest stage, narrow windows on three sides in the middle stage, and pairs of windows topped with hoodmoulds around the tower in the section below the spire. The 18th-century bell comes from the old church.|$|E
5|$|The church, {{which is}} small and rectangular, has no {{internal}} division between the nave and the chancel. It measures 47feet 6inches by 14feet 9inches (14.5 by 4.5m). It is built of rubble masonry, and the roof is made of slate; there is a gabled bellcote at {{the west end of}} the roof. The roof timbers {{can be seen from the}} inside. Entrance to the church is through a porch with a rounded arch at the west end of the south wall, and there is a vestry, with <b>one</b> <b>window,</b> at the west end of the north wall.|$|E
5|$|The fantail was made. Some of {{the small}} gears were replaced. The stocks were made from pitch pine and the blades from Douglas fir. Work at the mill over the winter {{included}} repairs to the brickwork and windows, with only <b>one</b> <b>window</b> still needing attention when the first work-in began. New beech cogs were fitted to the crown wheel, which was restored to its correct position on the upright shaft.|$|E

5|$|There {{is a pair}} {{of windows}} in the west wall {{decorated}} with tracery (stonework within the window frame forming a pattern). Scenes from the Bible and geometric patterns are shown in the stained glass, and birds (phoenix and peacock) are depicted {{at the top of the}} windows. The glass is dedicated to Rice Robert Hughes, a clergyman who died in 1801. There are three arched windows in the south wall of the nave; the stained glass of the easternmost (dedicated to William Bulkeley Hughes) shows biblical scenes. The easternmost window of the three in the north wall of the nave is dedicated to Thomas Bulkeley Hughes (who died in 1836), his wife and children. The chancel has <b>one</b> <b>window</b> in the east wall, which has three lights (sections of window separated by stone mullions).|$|E
5|$|George W. Jones, {{who would}} later become a U.S. Senator from Iowa, arrived in the Sinsinawa Mound area in 1827, and in 1828 {{established}} a mining settlement there. The first structure at the settlement was Jones's own log cabin, built {{during the spring of}} 1828 in two days. The cabin measured 49 feet (14.9 m) by 17feet (5.2m) and each room had one door and <b>one</b> <b>window.</b> When the Black Hawk War began four years later he also built a small fort at the site. The remains of the fort, one of many constructed in the region to protect local residents, are said to still stand {{at the entrance to the}} Sinsinawa Dominican complex. One of the men who assisted Jones in building the fort's blockhouse was Enoch Robinson, a soldier who later helped bury the victims of the Sinsinawa Mound raid. At the time of the attack Jones was with Henry Dodge's militia volunteers, on the way to meet overall commander General Henry Atkinson at Lake Koshkonong, then a marsh region.|$|E

25|$|Of the bedchambers, {{only the}} four corner rooms have {{fireplaces}}. Their fireplaces and surrounds {{did have some}} architectural detail. The corner rooms had two or three windows each, while the inner chambers only had <b>one</b> <b>window</b> each.

25|$|The {{carriages}} feature fifteen compartments and {{a corridor}} {{on the one}} side. There are regular doors at the {{one end of the}} carriage, where there is a vestibule, while smaller doors on the other end act as emergency exits. To provide comparability with older WLAB and B5 carriages, WLAB2s were initially installed without a closed gangway connection. On the compartment side there is <b>one</b> <b>window</b> for each compartment. On the corridor side there are two rows of windows and fifteen folding seats, each with place for two people.|$|E
25|$|The 30 foot (9 m) by 64 foot (20 m) {{rectangular}} {{building is}} composed of brick and features terrazzo flooring. The building is the most ornate of the commercial buildings in downtown Orangeville and is situated on the area's second highest lot. The main entrance, a large wooden, glass paneled door, is recessed and central on the symmetrical south (front) facade of the building. The original door is surrounded by sidelights and topped by a diamond patterned transom window. Flanking the central doorway on each side is a one over <b>one</b> <b>window,</b> each displaying the same diamond patterned transoms as the door.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, open stock had a two-window {{arrangement}} whereby each seating bay had two windows side by side. <b>One</b> <b>window</b> was fixed {{and the other}} was a droplight. Restaurant vehicles such as the B2 first class dining car and the B3 third class dining saloon had Stone's pattern ventilators above the fixed windows but this feature was not included in other open stock. The J5 open thirds were unusual in having four doors per side rather than two. The doors had adjacent quarter lights like those on the side corridor stock and opened directly into the passenger saloon rather than the end vestibules which only accommodated the lavatories.|$|E

25|$|During Scott’s 1860 additions, {{what is now}} {{the north}} aisle west window of four lancets, {{contemporary}} with the 13th-century geometrical nave west windows, was re-sited from the original north wall of the nave. The aisle also contains Scott’s run of four windows on its long north side, all of three lancets with cinquefoils—lobes formed by the overlapping of five circles—set in a rosette above within a pointed head, and at the east <b>one</b> <b>window</b> of two lancets with a quatrefoil rosette above. Above the aisle east and west windows are small glazed trefoil openings. Between the north wall windows, and at the aisle corners, are buttresses with steeply angled double steps to the eaves of the slate roof, with their socles, or base plinths, continuing around the faces of the aisle walls.|$|E
25|$|Since only <b>one</b> <b>window</b> in McEwen's car was open, {{and none}} of them had been shattered, Seedman knew the shot had to have been fired from Sheepshead Bay or the nearby area, and that due to the {{distance}} and the car's speed, it was probably not intentional. He ordered detectives and uniformed officers to search the dunes and marshes for a possible shell casing. After 2,400 people were interviewed and several other leads came to nothing, he pointed at a spot on the map and told his detectives to look for people who owned boats. That led to the shooter—a local gas station owner who had been on his boat that morning taking target practice at a floating beer can. One of his bullets had ricocheted off the water's surface and killed McEwen. A grand jury ruled it an accident, and no homicide charges were brought, although the shooter was fined $100 for violating firearms laws with the rifle.|$|E
25|$|On March 18 around 9:00 p.m. local time, {{crowds of}} students, academics, civic {{organizations}} and other protestors {{climbed over the}} fence at the legislature and entered the building. In the melee, <b>one</b> <b>window</b> of the Legislative Yuan was smashed and a police officer suffered serious injuries. A lawyer who {{was assigned to the}} protesters stated that six individuals had been arrested over the protest so far. While several hundred protesters remained outside the building, about 300 protesters occupied the legislative floor overnight and succeeded in preventing several attempts by police to expel them. The protesters demanded that the clause-by-clause review of the agreement be reinstated, otherwise they vowed to occupy the legislature until March 21, when the Yuan had scheduled to vote and pass the CSSTA. As night approached, the authorities cut water and electricity to the building. Premier Jiang Yi-huah ordered riot police be sent in to evict the protesters, but that directive was not implemented.|$|E
40|$|There {{are several}} {{differences}} between (i) seeing rain outside <b>one’s</b> <b>window</b> and (ii) episodically remembering seeing rain outside <b>one’s</b> <b>window.</b> <b>One</b> difference appears {{to pertain to}} felt temporal orientation: in episodically remembering seeing the rain, we experience the rain, and/or the seeing of it, as (having occurred in the) past; in perceiving the rain, we experience the rain as (in the) present. However, according to (what is widely regarded as) the most plausible metaphysics of time, {{there are no such}} properties as being past and being present. This seems to lead to an error theory about all perception and episodic memory. In this paper, I show {{how to get out of}} this untoward result.
