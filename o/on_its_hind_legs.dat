5|$|The levade: a {{position}} wherein the horse raises up both front legs, {{standing at a}} 30-degree angle entirely <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> in a controlled form that requires {{a great deal of}} hindquarter strength. A less difficult but related movement is the pesade, where the horse rises up to a 45-degree angle.|$|E
5|$|Although Stegosaurus is {{undoubtedly}} now {{considered to have}} been quadrupedal, some discussion has occurred over whether it could have reared up <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs,</b> using its tail to form a tripod with its hind limbs, and browsing for higher foliage. This has been proposed by Bakker and opposed by Carpenter. A study by Mallison (2010) found support a rearing up posture in Kentrosaurus, though not for ability for the tail {{to act as a}} tripod.|$|E
5|$|Despite being quadrupedal the {{ring-tailed lemur}} can rear up and balance <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs,</b> usually for {{aggressive}} displays. When threatened the ring-tailed lemur may {{jump in the}} air and strike out with its short nails and sharp upper canine teeth in a behaviour termed jump fighting. This is extremely rare outside of the breeding season when tensions are high and competition for mates is intense. Other aggressive behaviours include a threat-stare, used to intimidate or start a fight, and a submissive gesture known as pulled-back lips.|$|E

5|$|A full-grown Scelidosaurus {{was rather}} small {{compared}} to most later non-avian dinosaurs, {{but it was a}} medium-sized species in the Early Jurassic. Some scientists have estimated a length of 4metres (13ft). In 2010, Gregory S. Paul gave a body length of 3.8 metres (12.5ft) and a weight of 270 kilogrammes. Scelidosaurus was quadrupedal, with the hindlimbs longer than the forelimbs. It may have reared up <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> to browse on foliage from trees, but its arms were relatively long, indicating a mostly quadrupedal posture. A trackway from the Holy Cross Mountains of Poland shows a scelidosaur like animal walking in a bipedal manner, hinting that Scelidosaurus may have been more proficient at bipedalism than previously thought.|$|E
5|$|Amargasaurus was quadrupedal (moved on four legs), and {{probably}} {{was unable to}} rear <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs.</b> Salgado and Bonaparte (1991) suggested that Amargasaurus was a slow walker, as both the forearms and lower legs were proportionally short, as a feature common to slow-moving animals. This was contradicted by Gerardo Mazzetta and Richard Fariña (1999), who argued that Amargasaurus was capable of rapid locomotion. During locomotion, leg bones are strongly affected by bending moments, representing a limiting factor for the maximum speed of an animal. The leg bones of Amargasaurus were even more sturdy than those of today's white rhinoceros, which is adapted to galloping.|$|E
5|$|Brachiosaurus is {{the first}} dinosaur seen by the park's visitors. It is inaccurately {{depicted}} as chewing its food, and standing up <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> to browse among the high tree branches. According to artist Andy Schoneberg, the chewing was done to make the animal seem docile, {{in a way it}} resembled a cow chewing its cud. The dinosaur's head and upper neck was the largest puppet without hydraulics built for the film. Despite scientific evidence of their having limited vocal capabilities, sound designer Gary Rydstrom decided to represent them with whale songs and donkey calls to give them a melodic sense of wonder. Penguins were also recorded {{to be used in the}} noises of the dinosaurs.|$|E
50|$|Named for its pale-furred {{back and}} long hind limbs and feet, the pale {{kangaroo}} mouse is a large-headed rodent with fur-lined external cheek pouche. This species is bipedal, {{meaning that it}} generally moves around <b>on</b> <b>its</b> strong <b>hind</b> <b>legs,</b> hopping much like a kangaroo.|$|R

50|$|From {{the scant}} remains the living animal {{would appear to}} have been about three metres long (10 ft), with a {{typically}} prosauropodan appearance: bulky body, long neck, small head and clawed feet. Like other prosauropods, it was probably equally comfortable on all fours as well as <b>on</b> <b>its</b> elongated <b>hind</b> <b>legs.</b> It was herbivorous or may have been an omnivore.|$|R
5|$|The African {{elephant}} has two finger-like extensions {{at the tip}} of {{the trunk}} that allow it to grasp and bring food to its mouth. The Asian elephant has only one, and relies more on wrapping around a food item and squeezing it into its mouth. Asian elephants have more muscle coordination and can perform more complex tasks. Losing the trunk would be detrimental to an elephant's survival, although in rare cases, individuals have survived with shortened ones. One elephant has been observed to graze by kneeling on its front legs, raising <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> and taking in grass with its lips. Floppy trunk syndrome is a condition of trunk paralysis in African bush elephants caused by the degradation of the peripheral nerves and muscles beginning at the tip.|$|E
5|$|As {{described}} in a 2016 study, examination of melanosomes preserved in the specimen of Psittacosaurus preserved with integument indicated that the animal was countershaded, likely due to preferring a habitat in dense forests with little light, much like many modern species of forest-dwelling deer and antelope; stripes and spots on the limbs may represent disruptive coloration. The specimen also had dense clusters of pigment on its shoulders, face (possibly for display), and cloaca (which may have had an antimicrobial function), as well as large patagia <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> that connected {{to the base of}} the tail. Its large eyes indicate that it also likely had good vision, which would have been useful in finding food or avoiding predators. The authors pointed out that there might have been variation in coloration across the range of the animal, depending on differences in the light environment. The authors were unable to determine which species of Jehol Formation Psittacosaurus the specimen belonged to due to the way the skull is preserved, but ruled out P. mongoliensis, based on hip features.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} Rosa story {{featuring}} The Three Caballeros, Donald Duck is {{shocked by the}} sight of a capybara standing <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs,</b> with shrubs, leaves and fruit in front of its body, coincidentally making it look like Mickey Mouse. José Carioca and Panchito Pistoles, never having seen Mickey Mouse, ask Donald what is wrong, but Donald replies he is just tired. Later in the same story, the Caballeros free several animals from a poacher. One panel shows the animals fleeing; Mickey can be seen among them.|$|E
5000|$|The idea of {{a boxing}} {{kangaroo}} originates from the animal's defensive behavior, in which it will use its smaller forelegs (its [...] "arms") to hold an attacker in place while using the claws <b>on</b> <b>its</b> larger <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> to try to kick, slash or disembowel them. This stance {{gives the impression that}} the kangaroo appears to be [...] "boxing" [...] with its attacker.|$|R
5000|$|Polychrus gutturosus, {{also known}} as Berthold's bush anole, is a species of lizard found {{throughout}} tropical Central and South America. It is {{sometimes referred to as}} a [...] "forest iguana". It lives in forests and jungles from Honduras to Ecuador. It ranges from 24-34 inches from head to tail. This insectivorous iguana is a climbing species that can often be seen holding onto branches. It can even hold <b>on</b> with <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs,</b> though it moves slowly that way.|$|R

25|$|The {{entrance}} to the hall showcases six fossil shark jaws, ranging in height from 2–9 feet. The exhibition begins with five extinction events described in dioramas that lead visitors onto the Florida Platform at about 66 million years ago, {{also known as the}} Dawn of the Age of Mammals. Displays include a primitive-toothed whale in the Eocene, a pig-like, extinct mammal from the Oligocene, a Miocene rhinoceros being attacked by two saber-toothed, cat-like animals, a -tall sloth standing <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> in the Pliocene area and a 500,000-year-old jaguar chasing a peccary from the Pleistocene epoch. The time periods also include artwork by paleoartists from around the world, including a -tall steel sculpture of an extinct Terror Bird, Titanis walleri.|$|E
25|$|During {{the main}} season of its activity, May through September, the {{entrance}} to the nesting sites of P. gibbosus can be characterized by the scattered heaps of sand or soil around their supporting structure, usually bricks or tree roots. The sand heaps are very low and spread out. In building these sand heaps, females can be observed backing out of the burrow with moist sand or soil that is spread around into the heaps using jerks of her front legs. While burrowing, P. gibbosus stands <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs.</b> In order to dig the actual burrow, P. gibbosus uses its tarsi and mandibles to dig a shaft that is at least two feet in length. The shaft culminates in an oval shaped cell in which eggs are provisioned. Other oval shaped cells line the shaft which are smaller in size and contain the skeletons of other bees that were killed and fed to the larvae as nutrients.|$|E
25|$|Later, Zuo Ci went to Cao Cao, who granted him {{a pension}} {{to do his}} magics. Cao Cao may have shown an {{interest}} in the Taoist approach to longevity by doing this, but his son Cao Zhi wrote that the pensions are only intended to keep the magicians and their wild teachings under control. Zuo Ci performed a number of magic acts in Cao Cao's court, such as catching an exotic fish from an empty copper pan, and teleporting far away to buy ginger. Zuo Ci once fed a whole court assembly with food and wine, but Cao Cao soon found out that Zuo Ci had emptied every wine shop in the region with his magic for this purpose. Cao Cao tried to execute Zuo Ci, but Zuo escaped by walking through walls. When someone reported that Zuo Ci had been sighted in the market, everyone in the market became identical to Zuo's appearance. Another report said Zuo Ci went to the mountaintop, so Cao Cao and his men went, and realised Zuo was concealed among a flock of sheep. Knowing he could not find him, Cao Cao announced to the flock of sheep that he was merely trying to test Zuo Ci's skill, and had no intention to kill him. At the moment, a goat stood <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> and spoke. Cao Cao's men rushed to the goat, only to find the rest of the flock also turned into goats and started standing and speaking like humans. Zuo Ci was never found by Cao Cao's men again.|$|E
40|$|Two-dimensional {{motion sensors}} use {{electronic}} accelerometers {{to record the}} lying, stand-ing and walking activity of cattle. Movement behaviour data collected automatically using these sensors over prolonged periods of time could be of use to stakeholders making man-agement and disease control decisions in rural sub-Saharan Africa leading to potential improvements in animal health and production. Motion sensors were {{used in this study}} with the aim of monitoring and quantifying the movement behaviour of traditionally managed Angoni cattle in Petauke District in the Eastern Province of Zambia. This study was designed to assess whether motion sensors were suitable for use on traditionally managed cattle in two veterinary camps in Petauke District in the Eastern Province of Zambia. In each veterinary camp, twenty cattle were selected for study. Each animal had a motion sensor placed <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> <b>leg</b> to continuously measure and record its movement behaviour over a two week period.

Ruth, slightly ahead, reined in at once; so, too, did the groom in the rear, and so violently in his sudden fear of highwaymen that he brought his horse <b>on</b> to <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> and had it prancing and rearing madly about the road, so that he was hard put to it to keep his seat.|$|R

500|$|Spiders {{make use}} {{of a variety of}} {{different}} threat displays. Some such as Argiope and Pholcus make themselves and their webs vibrate rapidly when they are disturbed; this blurs their outline and perhaps makes them look larger, as well as more difficult to locate precisely for an attack. Mygalomorphae spiders such as tarantulas exhibit deimatic behaviour; when threatened, the spider rears back with its front legs and pedipalps spread and fangs bared. Some species, such as the dangerous Indian ornamental tree spider (Poecilotheria regalis) have bright colouring on the front legs and mouthparts which are shown off in its threat display when it [...] "rears up <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs,</b> and brandishes the fore limbs and palpi in the air".|$|E
500|$|Rodents, {{like all}} placental mammals except primates, have just {{two types of}} light {{receptive}} cones in their retina, a short wavelength [...] "blue-UV" [...] type and a middle wavelength [...] "green" [...] type. They are therefore classified as dichromats; however, they are visually sensitive into the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum and therefore can see light that humans can not. The functions of this UV sensitivity are not always clear. In degus, for example, the belly reflects more UV light than the back. Therefore, when a degu stands up <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs,</b> which it does when alarmed, it exposes its belly to other degus and ultraviolet vision may serve a purpose in communicating the alarm. When it stands on all fours, its low UV-reflectance back could help make the degu less visible to predators. Ultraviolet light is abundant during the day but not at night. There is a large increase in the ratio of ultraviolet to visible light {{in the morning and}} evening twilight hours. Many rodents are active during twilight hours (crepuscular activity), and UV-sensitivity would be advantageous at these times. Ultraviolet reflectivity is of dubious value for nocturnal rodents.|$|E

The symbol is a bull {{standing}} <b>on</b> <b>its</b> two <b>hind</b> <b>legs,</b> mimicking the prancing stallion symbol of Ferrari. The Argentine car's front end, rear fascia, and interior were redesigned by Italian auto stylists at Pininfarina to give it a more European look, as well as to make the Torino more appealing to the Argentine public and less like an American car. With the added exterior styling touches, as well as its unique trim and luxurious interior appointments, and Argentine built Kaiser-Jeep OHC six, the Torino was truly a product of Argentina.|$|R
50|$|Megatherium had {{a robust}} {{skeleton}} {{with a large}} pelvic girdle and a broad muscular tail. Its large size enabled it to feed at heights unreachable by other contemporary herbivores. Rising <b>on</b> <b>its</b> powerful <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> and using <b>its</b> tail to form a tripod, Megatherium could support its massive body weight while using the curved claws <b>on</b> <b>its</b> long forelegs to pull down branches with the choicest leaves. This sloth, like a modern anteater, walked {{on the sides of}} its feet because its claws prevented it from putting them flat on the ground. Although it was primarily a quadruped, its trackways show that it was capable of bipedal locomotion. Biomechanical analysis also suggests it had adaptations to bipedalism.|$|R
2500|$|The name [...] "Boxer" [...] is {{supposedly}} {{derived from the}} breed's tendency to play by standing <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> and [...] "boxing" [...] with its front paws.

60|$|Bradley was in {{the lead}} when he came {{suddenly}} upon a grotesque creature of Titanic proportions. Crouching among the trees, which here commenced to thin out slightly, Bradley saw {{what appeared to be}} an enormous dragon devouring the carcass of a mammoth.

The creature saw Bradley almost at the same instant that he saw it and reared up <b>on</b> <b>its</b> enormous <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> until <b>its</b> head towered a full twenty-five feet above the ground. From the cavernous jaws issued a hissing sound of a volume equal to the escaping steam from the safety-valves of half a dozen locomotives, and then the creature came for the man.|$|R
50|$|When startled, {{the common}} basilisk escapes by {{speeding}} {{to the nearest}} edge of water—and continues sprinting. The lizard runs <b>on</b> only <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> in an erect position, holding its fore legs to its sides. This basilisk is so adroit <b>on</b> water because <b>its</b> feet are large and equipped with flaps of skin along the toes that allow it to catch on tiny air bubbles. When moving quickly, the lizard can cross a surface of water before sinking. On water, it runs an average speed of 8.4 km/h (or 5.2 mph), {{which is just a}} little slower than <b>its</b> speed <b>on</b> land. Younger basilisks can run 10 to 20 meters on water, while adults cross only a few meters before sinking. Adults do not move slowly, but they weigh more and cannot sprint for as long a time. Once a basilisk submerges, it continues swimming until it is sufficiently far from its pursuer—if the predator has followed past the bank. Although this lizard stays close to water to escape terrestrial predators, it swims only when necessary because some other aquatic animals would eat the basilisk given the chance.|$|R
