40|$|Six {{alternatives}} for <b>the</b> interim storage <b>of</b> remote-handled mixed <b>wastes</b> from <b>the</b> 324 Building on the Hanford Site {{have been identified}} and evaluated. The alternatives focus on the interim storage facility and include use of existing facilities in the 200 Area, <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> new facilities, and <b>the</b> vitrification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wastes</b> within <b>the</b> 324 Building to remove <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wastes</b> from under RCRA regulations. The six alternatives are summarized in Table S. 1, which identifies the primary facilities to be utilized, the anticipated schedule for removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wastes,</b> <b>the</b> costs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transfer from 324 Building to the interim storage facility (including any capital costs), and an initial risk comparison <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alternatives. A recently negotiated Tri-Party Agreement (TPA) change requires <b>the</b> last <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mixed <b>wastes</b> to be removed by May 1999. The ability to use an existing facility reduces the costs since it {{eliminates the need for}} new capital construction. The basic regulatory approvals for <b>the</b> storage <b>of</b> mixed <b>wastes</b> are in place for the PUREX facility, but the Form HI permit will need some minor modifications since <b>the</b> 324 Building <b>wastes</b> have some additional characteristic <b>waste</b> codes and <b>the</b> current permit limits storage of wastes to those from the facility itself. Regulatory reviews have indicated that it will be best to use the tunnels to store <b>the</b> <b>wastes.</b> <b>The</b> PUREX alternatives will only provide storage for about 65 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wastes.</b> This results from <b>the</b> current schedule <b>of</b> <b>the</b> B-Cell Clean Out Project, which projects that dispersible debris will continue to be collected in small quantities until the year 2000. <b>The</b> remaining fraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wastes</b> will then be stored in another facility. Central Waste Complex (CWC) is currently proposed for that residual waste storage; however, other options may also be available...|$|R
5|$|In the 1930s, {{plans were}} made to cover the Senne along its entire course within the greater Brussels area, which had grown {{significantly}} since the covering of the 19th century. The course of the Senne was changed to the downtown's peripheral boulevards. In 1976, the disused tunnels were converted into the north-south axis of Brussels' underground tram system, the premetro.

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that given its proportion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>waste</b> stream and the lack of distinct collections, food waste is not currently being targeted appropriately. However proposals by the European Union, which would require local authorities to provide separate collection of food and garden waste, have been met with opposition; critics of the proposals argue that local authorities understand the specific needs of the areas they serve, and that they should decide waste policy. Advocates of the proposals say that it will ensure energy is not wasted in sorting biodegradable waste from other materials.|$|E

5|$|Actual {{purification}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>waste</b> {{water from}} the Brussels-Capital Region was not completed until the 21st century, when two purification stations were built. The south station treats refuse water from 360,000 inhabitants, which is about {{one third of the}} polluted water, and lies on the border of Anderlecht and Forest. The north station, completed in March 2007, is located near the border of the Brussels-Capital Region, between the Senne and the Charleroi-Willebroek Canal, near Buda Bridge. A portion of the cost was footed by the Flemish Government, as 7 of the adjacent municipalities lie within the Flemish Region. This station is capable of treating the water of 1,100,000 inhabitants and should finally be capable of fully purifying the Senne, which had long caused much of the pollution of the Scheldt river.|$|E

5|$|DOE {{has stated}} that seismic and tectonic effects on the natural systems at Yucca Mountain will not {{significantly}} affect repository performance. Yucca Mountain lies in a region of ongoing tectonic deformation, but the deformation rates are too slow to significantly affect the mountain during the 10,000-year regulatory compliance period. Rises in the water table caused by seismic activity would be, at most, a few tens of meters and would not reach the repository. The fractured and faulted volcanic tuff that Yucca Mountain comprises reflects the occurrence of many earthquake-faulting and strong ground motion events during the last several million years, and the hydrological characteristics of the rock would not be changed significantly by seismic events that may occur in the next 10,000 years. The engineered barrier system components will reportedly provide substantial protection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>waste</b> from seepage water, even under severe seismic loading.|$|E
5|$|Food waste puts a large {{burden on}} the {{finances}} of each household and local councils in the UK; wasted food is estimated to cost each British household £250–£400 per year, accumulating to £15,000–£24,000 over a lifetime. This comes from the total purchasing cost of the food against what is thrown away uneaten. Additionally, households pay for the collection and disposal of food waste by their local council {{in the form of}} council tax. For councils, the cost of food waste comes from its collection and disposal as a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>waste</b> stream; this is especially an issue for councils that run separate food waste collections.|$|E
5|$|Incinerating waste has {{traditionally}} been viewed as a method with the main purpose being the destruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>waste</b> involved. Recovering the energy generated from this process has become of greater importance, and all incineration facilities in England now operate as energy-from-waste plants (with many operating as {{combined heat and power}} facilities). Critics question the safety of the pollutants emitted during the process and argue that, as incinerators require constant levels of waste to operate, it encourages more waste. However, the levels of emissions from the incinerating process has been greatly reduced by developments in technology and legislation.|$|E
40|$|Sweden is a {{long-term}} world reference country in terms of sustainable development. On the other hand, Barcelona has recently made great efforts {{in order to improve}} and to make society aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> environmental issues. Hence, {{it would be interesting to}} investigate if these efforts had succeeded in <b>the</b> <b>waste’s</b> management in Barcelona compared to other leading European cities, and particularly to <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> Gävle. In this work, <b>the</b> operation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> management <b>of</b> <b>the</b> urban solid <b>wastes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two cities is explained. First, the objectives marked by Agenda 21 of each locality are exposed. Next, a theoretical perspective about management, generation of wastes and types of waste treatment is provided.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{increased}} volume <b>of</b> <b>wastes</b> {{that can}} be stored in a given impoundment is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most significant potential advantages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> co-disposal <b>of</b> coarse and fine mine wastes by combined pumping.
