500|$|Josepha Petrick Kemarre (born ca. 1945 <b>or</b> <b>ca.</b> 1953, date uncertain) is an Anmatyerre-speaking Indigenous Australian artist from Central Australia. Since first {{taking up}} {{painting}} around 1990, her works of contemporary Indigenous Australian art have been acquired by several major collections including Artbank and the National Gallery of Victoria. Her paintings portray bush plum [...] "dreaming" [...] and women’s ceremonies (known as Awelye). One of her paintings {{sold at a}} charity auction for A$22,800. Josepha Petrick's works are strongly coloured and formalist in composition and regularly appear at commercial art auctions in Australia. Her art appears to have survived the huge contraction of the primary art market in Australia since 2008. There is no existing Catalogue raisonné of Josepha Petrick's artworks, to date, no fakes have been cited.|$|E
500|$|The {{rotation}} period for Tau Ceti {{was measured by}} periodic variations in the classic H and K absorption lines of singly ionized calcium, <b>or</b> <b>Ca</b> II. These lines are closely associated with surface magnetic activity, so the period of variation measures the time required for the activity sites to complete a full rotation about the star. By this means the {{rotation period}} for Tau Ceti {{is estimated to be}} [...] Due to the Doppler effect, the rotation rate of a star affects the width of the absorption lines in the spectrum. (Light {{from the side of the}} star moving away from the observer will be shifted to a longer wavelength; light from the side moving towards the observer will be shifted toward a shorter wavelength.) By analyzing the width of these lines, the rotational velocity of a star can be estimated. The projected rotation velocity for Tau Ceti is: ...|$|E

500|$|Nikephoros Phokas ( [...] , Nikēphoros Phōkas; died 895/6 <b>or</b> <b>ca.</b> 900), usually surnamed the Elder to {{distinguish}} {{him from his}} grandson, Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas, {{was one of the}} most prominent Byzantine generals of the late 9th century, and the first important member of the Phokas family. As a youth he was taken into the personal retinue of Emperor Basil I the Macedonian, rising quickly to the posts of protostrator and then governor of Charsianon, whence he fought with success against the Arabs. In ca. 886 he led a major expedition in southern Italy, where his victories laid the foundation for the Byzantine resurgence in the peninsula. After his return, he was raised to the post of Domestic of the Schools, in effect commander-in-chief of the army, which he led with success against the Arabs in the east and the Bulgarians of Tsar Simeon in the Balkans. He died either in 895/6 or, less likely, sometime ca. 900. Contemporaries and later historians lauded him for his military ability and character. Both of his sons later succeeded him as Domestics of the Schools. His grandsons Nikephoros and Leo were likewise distinguished generals, while the former became emperor in 963–969, spearheading the recovery of several lost provinces from the Arabs.|$|E

2500|$|Named {{after the}} English gold {{sovereign}}, last minted in 1604, {{the name was}} revived with the Great Recoinage of 1816. Minting these new sovereigns began in 1817. By the coin act of 1816, 12 Troy ounces of 22-carat gold were worth 44.5 Guineas (a Guinea being £1.05). This meant that the 1-pound sovereign should weigh 160/623 ounces (~0.257oz or 7.98g), whereas its content of pure gold was 22/24 of this (~0.23542oz <b>or</b> <b>ca.</b> 7.322381g). This weight has remained almost constant [...] rounding at 10−6g took place on its legal redefinition in the decimalised rather than fractional system of coin weights.|$|E
2500|$|All of the {{lanthanides}} form Ln2Q3 (Q= S, Se, Te). The sesquisulfides can {{be produced}} by reaction of the elements or (with the exception of Eu2S3) sulfidizing the oxide (Ln2O3) with H2S. The sesquisulfides, Ln2S3 generally lose sulfur when heated and can form a range of compositions between Ln2S3 and Ln3S4. The sesquisulfides are insulators {{but some of the}} Ln3S4 are metallic conductors (e.g. Ce3S4) formulated (Ln3+)3 (S2−)4 (e−), while others (e.g. Eu3S4 and Sm3S4) are semiconductors. Structurally the sesquisulfides adopt structures that vary according {{to the size of the}} Ln metal. The lighter and larger lanthanides favouring 7 coordinate metal atoms, the heaviest and smallest lanthanides (Yb and Lu) favouring 6 coordination and the rest structures with a mixture of 6 and 7 coordination. Polymorphism is common amongst the sesquisulfides. The colors of the sesquisulfides vary metal to metal and depend on the polymorphic form. The colors of the γ-sesquisulfides are La2S3, white/yellow; Ce2S3, dark red; Pr2S3, green; [...] Nd2S3, light green; Gd2S3, sand; Tb2S3, light yellow and Dy2S3, orange. The shade of γ-Ce2S3 can be varied by doping with Na <b>or</b> <b>Ca</b> with hues ranging from dark red to yellow, and Ce2S3 based pigments are used commercially and are seen as low toxicity substitutes for cadmium based pigments.|$|E
