40|$|Objective: aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} current knowledge and practice regarding AMTSL in midwifery practices and <b>obstetric</b> <b>departments</b> in the Netherlands. Design: web-based and postal questionnaire. Setting: in August and September 2011 a questionnaire was sent to all midwifery practices and all <b>obstetric</b> <b>departments</b> in the Netherlands. Participants: all midwifery practices (528) and all <b>obstetric</b> <b>departments</b> (91) in the Netherlands. Measurements and findings: the response was 87. 5 %. Administering prophylactic uterotonics was seen as a component AMTSL by virtually all respondents; 96. 1 % of midwives and 98. 8 % of obstetricians. Cord clamping was found as a component of AMTSL by 87. 4 % of midwives and by 88. 1 % of obstetricians. Uterine massage was only seen as a component of AMTSL by 10 % of the midwives and 20. 2 % of the obstetricians. Midwifery practices routinely administer oxytocin in 60. 1 % of births. <b>Obstetric</b> <b>departments</b> do so in 97. 6 % (. p< 0. 01). Compared to 1995, the prophylactic use of oxytocin had increased in 2011 both by midwives (10 - 59. 1 %) and by obstetricians (55 - 96. 4 %) (. p< 0. 01). Key conclusions: prophylactic administration of uterotonics directly after childbirth is perceived as the essential part of AMTSL. The administration of uterotonics has significantly increased in the last decade, but is not standard practice in the low-risk population supervised by midwives. Implications for practice: the evidence for prophylactic administration of uterotonics is convincing for women who are at high risk of PPH. Regarding the lack of evidence of AMTSL to prevent PPH in low risk (home) births, further research concerning low-risk (home) births, supervised by midwives in industrialised countries is indicated. A national guideline containing best practices concerning management of the third stage of labour supervised by midwives, should be composed and implemented. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Diagnosis and {{management}} of intrauterine growth retardation during pregnancy remain a major challenge in obstetric care. The objective of this survey was to evaluate the routine clinical management of pregnancies with suspected intrauterine growth retardation at <b>obstetric</b> <b>departments</b> in Sweden. METHODS: In 1997, a questionnaire was sent to all 59 <b>obstetric</b> <b>departments</b> in Sweden. Forty-two departments, caring for 83 % of all deliveries in Sweden, replied. Four major topics were addressed: definition and diagnosis of intrauterine growth retardation; magnitude of the problem; clinical management; use of Doppler ultrasound in clinical decision-making. RESULTS: Intrauterine growth retardation is diagnosed {{by a combination of}} serial fundal height measurements and ultrasonic fetal biometry at 40 departments, two departments perform routine fetal biometry at 32 weeks. The diagnosis is most often made at 32 - 36 gestational weeks. Five departments use 1. 5 s. d. below the mean as cut-off point for diagnosis of small for gestational age fetuses; 35 departments use mean - 2 s. d. and two departments mean - 2. 5 s. d. Intrauterine growth retardation is suspected in 1. 6 - 6. 3 % pregnancies. About 19 % of patients with suspected intrauterine growth retardation are hospitalized. On average, 63 % of all small-for-gestational age babies are diagnosed prenatally. Thirty-nine out of 42 <b>obstetric</b> <b>departments</b> use formalized management protocols. All departments use cardiotocography, repeat ultrasound scans and Doppler ultrasound for antenatal surveillance. CONCLUSIONS: In Swedish obstetric units, the diagnostic procedures and methods of fetal surveillance in pregnancies suspected of intrauterine growth retardation are more or less uniform. Doppler examination of umbilical artery is used at all responding departments and is considered a valuable asset in clinical decision-making...|$|R

50|$|The {{large number}} of {{pregnant}} women with pelvic girdle pain, was a challenge at the <b>obstetric</b> <b>department.</b> Little was known about the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} this painful condition in pregnant and post-partum women. Together with another physiotherapists Mona Godskesen, she undertook the challenge of attempting to classify the different groups of Pelvic Girdle pain into subgroups which required different treatment. The study (still the largest in the world) included 2269 pregnant women. All of them were examined in their 20. week of pregnancy. The women who suffered from pelvic pain were followed at 1, 3,6,12, 24 months after delivery, or until their pelvic pain subsided. The main findings of the study were, that there are most likely four different subgroups of pelvic girdle pain. Then different groups have different incidence, and there is different clinical characteristics and pain pattern and different prognosis. Most important is the subgroups; Pelvic Girdle Syndrome, 5% of the pregnant women suffer from Pelvic Gridle Syndrome. Unfortunately, these women have a poor prognosis, hence 20% of the women still suffer from pain 2 years after delivery of the child. This research resulted in five scientific papers and three summaries. For this scientific work she was awarded two awards, and a seat in the European Guideline Group.|$|E
