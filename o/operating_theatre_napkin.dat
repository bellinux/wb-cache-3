Video-Supported Simulation for Interactions in the <b>Operating</b> <b>Theatre</b> draws on original video-based research on teamwork in the <b>operating</b> <b>theatres</b> in the United Kingdom. The {{objective of this}} model was to improve verbal and nonverbal interactions between nurses and surgeons that often fall outside explicit training. These involve visual monitoring of colleagues, verbal responsiveness, speaking up about distractions, and seeking prompt clarification when needed. The model includes two scenarios and video-supported debriefing, which uses authentic research footage from the <b>operating</b> <b>theatres.</b> In the article, the strategies are briefly communicated and implications for training are discussed...|$|R

40|$|There is {{a growing}} concern that adverse events occur {{frequently}} in <b>operating</b> <b>theatres.</b> Adverse events such as wrong site surgery and surgical site infections have a severe detrimental impact on not only the patient but also the healthcare staff and the services. Institute of Medicine’s report, ‘To err is human’ highlighted that teamwork failures are a leading cause of death and suffering. Yet, in surgery, measuring teamwork and designing interventions to improve teamwork and patient safety in <b>operating</b> <b>theatres</b> remains an area of research that is largely unexplored. This thesis aims to measure and improve teamwork in <b>operating</b> <b>theatres</b> to ensure safer surgery. In this project, the WHO surgical safety checklist was evaluated for its impact on patient safety. The WHO checklist improved patient safety processes in <b>operating</b> <b>theatres</b> but its impact on teamwork, intra-operative problems and theatre efficiency was not clearly understood. Therefore, a framework was developed to measure teamwork failures, equipment problems and technical failures as surrogate markers of teamwork, patient safety and efficiency in <b>operating</b> <b>theatres.</b> Equipment failures emerged as a sensitive measure of teamwork in <b>operating</b> <b>theatres.</b> Teamwork failures were also associated with technical failures, delay in case progress and patient harm. It emerged that the WHO checklist can improve teamwork and theatre efficiency and reduce equipment problems in <b>operating</b> <b>theatres</b> when it is used in its true spirit rather than a tick-box exercise.

40|$|The {{theme of}} the Bachelor Degree Work Nursing Care and Communication with the Patient in the <b>Operating</b> <b>Theatre</b> was chosen to map out {{the issue of the}} current level of the nursing care and {{communication}} with the patient in the environment which is for most of them stressful and makes increased demands both on the nursing care and on communication too. Nowadays this theme is very topical as patients´ participation in their treatment come to the fore and their awareness of the types of treatment and carried out surgeries is generally being increased. The proper communication level undoubtedly influences the patient´s state. The theoretical part of the work deals with the environment of the <b>operating</b> <b>theatre</b> and the nursing care provided by the anaesthetic nurse. Further it deals with the kinds of communication and its significance for the patient. The practical part contains the results of the quantitative research on the anaesthetic nurses providing nursing care in the <b>operating</b> <b>theatre</b> who also communicate with the patient in the <b>operating</b> <b>theatre</b> most of all. Further there are described results of the qualitative research on patients having experience with the stay in the <b>operating</b> <b>theatre.</b> The Bachelor Degree Work contains much information about particular characteristics of the nursing care in the <b>operating</b> <b>theatre.</b> It reveals hidden reserves in communication with the patient in this environment. It refers to the most often patients´ problems in communication with the operating team. It maps out the knowledge level of the anaesthetic nurses in the sphere of the nursing care and communication. There have been set several aims, hypotheses and research questions to write this work. For aim no. 1, to find out the level of the nursing care for the patient in the <b>operating</b> <b>theatre</b> from the nurse´s point of view, there were made three hypotheses. Hypothesis no. 1 - Nurses have developed nursing care standard in the operation theatre - is confirmed. Hypothesis no. 2 - Nurses have time to provide the nursing care in the <b>operating</b> <b>theatre</b> - is confirmed. Hypothesis no. 3 - Nurses have sufficient material and technical equipment to provide the nursing care in the <b>operating</b> <b>theatre</b> - is confirmed. Aim no. 2 was to map out the communication between the nursing team and the patient in the <b>operating</b> <b>theatre</b> and there were made two hypotheses. Hypothesis no. 1 - Communication between the nursing team and the patient is influenced by the stressful environment in the <b>operating</b> <b>theatre</b> - is confirmed.. Hypothesis no. 2 - Communication between the nursing team and the patient is limited by the operation hours of the <b>operating</b> <b>theatres</b> is confirmed. For aim no. 3, to find out the level of communication in the <b>operating</b> <b>theatre</b> between the nursing team and the patient from the patient´s point of view, there were set two research questions. How does the patient perceive communication with the operating team in the environment of the <b>operating</b> <b>theatre?</b> How is communication in the environment of the <b>operating</b> <b>theatre</b> going on? The research questions have been answered. The set aims of the work have been fulfilled. The results of the research work were used for writing the nursing standard "The Nursing Care for the Patient in the Operating Theatre". This standard can serve nurses as a brief and clear aid in the nursing process and in order to provide the patient with comfort and security of the quality nursing care in the <b>operating</b> <b>theatre...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The next {{phases of}} development, opened in 1938 {{resulted}} {{in the construction of}} a dedicated <b>operating</b> <b>theatre,</b> which was until this stage, housed in various other buildings on the site. The <b>operating</b> <b>theatre</b> was designed by POE Hawkes and is obviously influenced by Spanish Mission architecture which was a popular inter-war architectural style. The building was constructed adjacent to the western side of the newly opened Demaine Block. The design of the <b>operating</b> <b>theatre</b> was described in the local newspaper at the time of opening [...] "as the most up to date in Australia" [...] and influenced by a [...] "famous hospital in Berlin".

40|$|Hospitalised {{patients}} {{are most likely}} to suffer harm in the <b>operating</b> <b>theatre.</b> Non-technical and team skills have been identified, and are increasingly recognised, as critical to safety and efficiency in the <b>operating</b> <b>theatre.</b> Despite increasing awareness of the importance of these skills to patient safety, education, training and assessment is lacking. The overarching aim of this Thesis is to facilitate and accelerate the integration of these skills into the education, training, and assessment of <b>operating</b> <b>theatre</b> teams by addressing a number of challenges related to this endeavour. An introduction to patient safety and the core non-technical and team skills that underpin expertise and safety in the <b>operating</b> <b>theatre</b> is presented, providing the theoretical basis for this work (Chapters 1 & 2). A systematic review on the impact of non-technical skills on technical performance in surgery is presented (Chapter 3), underlining the need to integrate these skills into the education, training and assessment of <b>operating</b> <b>theatre</b> teams. The empirical work of this Thesis is then reported. An observational study exploring stress and teamwork in the <b>operating</b> <b>theatre</b> is presented (Chapter 4), increasing our understanding of the factors that facilitate and impede teamwork in the <b>operating</b> <b>theatre.</b> To ensure the robust assessment of teamwork in the <b>operating</b> <b>theatre,</b> the formal content validation and refinement of the Observational Teamwork Assessment for Surgery (OTAS) tool is reported (Chapter 5). This is followed by an observational study exploring team performance at specific operative stages, as well as in multiport versus single incision laparoscopic surgery (Chapter 6). Chapters 7 - 8 report the development of guidelines, based on expert consensus, to train faculty in the assessment of non-technical and teamwork skills, an essential feat if non-technical and team skills are to be successfully integrated into the training and assessment of <b>operating</b> <b>theatre</b> teams. Chapter 9 reports the development, piloting and evaluation of a programme, based on the findings of Chapters 7 - 8, to train faculty to assess teamwork in the <b>operating</b> <b>theatre.</b> Finally, Chapter 10 provides a general discussion of the work presented in this Thesis, reflecting on the findings and the wider evidence base. Implications for clinical practice, patient safety and future research are explored. Imperial Users onl...|$|R

40|$|Background: In recent years, <b>operating</b> <b>theatre</b> nurse students’ {{education}} focussed on ethical value {{issues and}} how the patient’s dignity is respected in the perioperative practice. Health professionals are frequently confronted with ethical issues that can impact on patient’s care during surgery. Objective: The objective {{of this study was}} to present what <b>operating</b> <b>theatre</b> nurse students experienced and interpreted as preserved dignity in perioperative practice. Research design: The study has a descriptive design with a hermeneutic approach. Data were collected using Flanagan’s critical incident technique. Participants and research context: <b>Operating</b> <b>theatre</b> nurse students from Sweden and Norway participated and collected data in 2011, after education in ethics and dignity. Data consisting of 47 written stories and the text were analysed with hermeneutical text interpretation. Ethical considerations: The study was conducted accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by a local University Ethics Research Committee. Findings: The findings revealed that students experienced that <b>operating</b> <b>theatre</b> nurses perserved patient’s dignity in perioperative practice by being present for each other and making themselves known to the patient. <b>Operating</b> <b>theatre</b> nurses caring for the patient by being compassionate and preserved the patient privacy. The new understanding that emerged was that the <b>operating</b> <b>theatre</b> nurse students understood that the <b>operating</b> <b>theatre</b> nurse wanted to care for the patient like a human being. Discussion: In the discussion, we have illuminated how professional ethics may be threatened by more pragmatic and utilitarian arguments contained in regulations and transplant act. Conclusion: Preserved dignity is an ethical and caring act. Ethical questions and how to preserve dignity in perioperative practice should be discussed more both in educations of healthcare professionals and in clinical practice...|$|R
