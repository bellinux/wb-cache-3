FLCN is highly conserved in vertebrates—it is very similar between many vertebrate species. The 508th amino acid, normally lysine, is affected by a missense mutation in some people with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome.

5|$|Essential {{genes are}} {{the set of}} genes thought to be {{critical}} for an organism's survival. This definition assumes the abundant availability of all relevant nutrients {{and the absence of}} environmental stress. Only a small portion of an organism's genes are essential. In bacteria, an estimated 250–400 genes are essential for Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, which is less than 10% of their genes. Half of these genes are <b>orthologs</b> in both organisms and are largely involved in protein synthesis. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the number of essential genes is slightly higher, at 1000 genes (~20% of their genes). Although the number is more difficult to measure in higher eukaryotes, mice and humans are estimated to have around 2000 essential genes (~10% of their genes). The synthetic organism, Syn 3, has a minimal genome of 473 essential genes and quasi-essential genes (necessary for fast growth), although 149 have unknown function.|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{various types}} of {{biological}} data, including genomic sequences, have been rapidly accumulating. To discover biological knowledge from such growing heterogeneous data, a flexible framework for data integration is necessary. <b>Ortholog</b> information is a central resource for interlinking corresponding genes among different organisms, and the Semantic Web provides a key technology for the flexible integration of heterogeneous data. We have constructed an <b>ortholog</b> database using the Semantic Web technology, aiming at the integration of numerous genomic data and {{various types of}} biological information. To formalize {{the structure of the}} <b>ortholog</b> information in the Semantic Web, we have constructed the <b>Ortholog</b> Ontology (OrthO). While the OrthO is a compact ontology for general use, it is designed to be extended to the description of database-specific concepts. On the basis of OrthO, we described the <b>ortholog</b> information from our Microbial Genome Database for Comparative Analysis (MBGD) in the form of Resource Description Framework (RDF) and made it available through the SPARQL endpoint, which accepts arbitrary queries specified by users. In this framework based on the OrthO, the biological data of different organisms can be integrated using the <b>ortholog</b> information as a hub. Besides, the <b>ortholog</b> information from different data sources can be compared with each other using the OrthO as a shared ontology. Here we show some examples demonstrating that the <b>ortholog</b> information described in RDF can be used to link various biological data such as taxonomy information and Gene Ontology. Thus, the <b>ortholog</b> database using the Semantic Web technology can contribute to biological knowledge discovery through integrative data analysis...|$|R

40|$|The {{identification}} of orthologous genes shared by multiple genomes {{plays an important}} role in evolutionary studies and gene functional analyses. Based on a recently developed accurate tool, called MSOAR 2. 0, for <b>ortholog</b> assignment between a pair of closely related genomes based on genome rearrangement, we present a new system MultiMSOAR 2. 0, to identify <b>ortholog</b> groups among multiple genomes in this paper. In the system, we construct gene families for all the genomes using sequence similarity search and clustering, run MSOAR 2. 0 for all pairs of genomes to obtain the pairwise orthology relationship, and partition each gene family into a set of disjoint sets of orthologous genes (called super <b>ortholog</b> groups or SOGs) such that each SOG contains at most one gene from each genome. For each such SOG, we label the leaves of the species tree using 1 or 0 to indicate if the SOG contains a gene from the corresponding species or not. The resulting tree is called a tree of <b>ortholog</b> groups (or TOGs). We then label the internal nodes of each TOG based on the parsimony principle and some biological constraints. <b>Ortholog</b> groups are finally identified from each fully labeled TOG. In comparison with a popular tool MultiParanoid on simulated data, MultiMSOAR 2. 0 shows significantly higher prediction accuracy. It also outperforms MultiParanoid, the Roundup multi-ortholog repository and the Ensembl <b>ortholog</b> database in real data experiments using gene symbols as a validation tool. In addition to <b>ortholog</b> group identification, MultiMSOAR 2. 0 also provides information about gene births, duplications and losses in evolution, which may be of independent biologica...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} method for {{automatically}} extracting groups of orthologous genes from a large set of genomes by a new clustering algorithm on a weighted multipartite graph. The method assigns a score to an arbitrary subset of genes from multiple genomes to assess the orthologous relationships between genes in the subset. This score is computed using sequence similarities between the member genes and the phylogenetic relationship between the corresponding genomes. An <b>ortholog</b> cluster is found as the subset with the highest score, so <b>ortholog</b> clustering is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem. The algorithm for finding an <b>ortholog</b> cluster runs in time OðjEjþjV j log jV jÞ, where V and E are the sets of vertices and edges, respectively, in the graph. However, if we discretize the similarity scores into a constant number of bins, the runtime improves to OðjEjþjV jÞ. The proposed method was applied to seven complete eukaryote genomes on which the manually curated database of eukaryotic <b>ortholog</b> clusters, KOG, is constructed. A comparison of our results with the manually curated <b>ortholog</b> clusters shows that our clusters are well correlated with the existing clusters.
