5|$|In May 1914, Carl Larsson resumed {{the work}} on the {{painting}} on his own initiative. During 1915, he presented a painted sketch (№ 239), which was largely consistent with the previous painting. The king had been remade based on an oil painting (№ 240) that Larsson had made with a male model named Rydberg in 1914. The king's position was more pathetically composed and expressive and it agreed more with the change <b>of</b> <b>emphasis</b> that had taken place during the evolution of the work after Larsson's decision that the sacrifice was voluntary.|$|E
5|$|James Cook's voyages of 1771–74 {{demonstrated}} conclusively {{the likely}} hostile nature of any hidden lands. This caused a shift <b>of</b> <b>emphasis</b> {{in the first}} half of the 19th century, away from trade and towards sealing and whaling, and then exploration and discovery. After the first overwintering on continental Antarctica in 1898-99 (Adrien de Gerlache), the prospect of reaching the South Pole appeared realistic, and the race for the pole began. The British were pre-eminent in this endeavor, which was characterized by the rivalry between Robert Falcon Scott and Ernest Shackleton during the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration. Shackleton's efforts fell short; Scott reached the pole in January 1912 only to find that he had been beaten by the Norwegian Amundsen.|$|E
