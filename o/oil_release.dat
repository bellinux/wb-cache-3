40|$|Excessive {{consumption}} of saturated and {{trans fatty acids}} is positively correlated with {{an increased risk of}} cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome and Type II diabetes. The search for new materials able to replace and/or reduce saturated/hydrogenated fats using structural design principles is a timely topic. A novel strategy consists on gelation of oil using small molecules (organogelators) that are able to self-assemble in liquid oils. The resulting material, an organogel or oleogel, has similar physical properties to those of fats. Different molecules have been proposed as organogelators such as monoglycerides, fatty acids, fatty alcohols, 12 -hydroxystearic acid, waxes, phytosterols, etc. However, among them, fatty alcohols have received little attention in literature. The aim of this research was to study the ability of saturated fatty alcohols with different even carbon chain length (1 -tetradecanol, 1 -hexadecanol, 1 -octadecanol, 1 -eicosanol, and 1 -docosanol) to gel peanut oil under different cooling rates. To this aim, minimum gelling concentrations, <b>oil</b> <b>release,</b> solid fat content, back extrusion firmness, microstructure by polarized light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, and ultra-small X-ray scattering analysis were carried out. Results highlighted that organogels were composed of monotectic phases where fatty alcohols crystals aggregated forming a network that entrapped the oil. The gelling ability of fatty alcohols increased increasing the chain length and decreasing the cooling rate. During storage, fatty alcohol crystals showed a reduction of the lamella thickness that was accompanied to an increase of <b>oil</b> <b>release</b> and a reduction of organonel firmness. The results acquired are interesting in the attempt to tailor fatty alcohol organogels characteristics...|$|E

The fabrics were characterized by Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Differential ScanningCalorimetry (DSC), Contact Angle and Infrared Thermography. The thyme <b>oil</b> <b>release</b> was also analyzed,as well as the antibacterial and antifungal activity. The materials treated with 20 L/mL of thyme oilhave shown anomalous <b>oil</b> <b>release</b> mechanisms, according to the Korsmeyer-Peppas model, and activityagainst Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Trichophyton rubrum, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candidaalbicans.

40|$|In the thesis, {{we discuss}} the {{processes}} of stranding and release of oil on the coast and off the coast {{in the case of}} an oil spill. We presented different ways of determining the maximum oil–holding capacity of the beach, and established that the retention mainly depends on the types of coastline and type of oil. Based on the classification of the coastline types in Slovenia, we chose a section of sandy and gravelly coastline as an example. For these types of coastlines, we calculated maximum oil–holding capacities of the coast. In calculations, we used a simple empirical equation that offers favourable ratio among the number of necessary and available data, and good reliability of the results estimated in literature. Calculations were performed in Microsoft Excel, using a newly created table that enables fast and simple calculations. The chosen approach enables relatively simple installation into numerical models of oil spills, and could contribute to higher reliability of such models. For the chosen sections of sandy and gravelly coastlines, we also carried out calculations of <b>oil</b> <b>release</b> off the coast, in which we presumed that the maximum capacity of the coast is filled up. We established that the process of <b>oil</b> <b>release</b> off a sandy coast is completed in a few days, while on a gravelly coast it lasts longer for three to four orders of magnitude. The knowledge on the quantity of oil released to the sea and the time of release for different types of oil and coastlines is important. It can enable the corresponding services to intervene reasonably and to protect the coastline sections that could be reached by the released oil...|$|E
