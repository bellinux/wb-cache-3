40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{phenomena}} of "crowdsourcing", or the <b>outsourcing</b> <b>of</b> <b>tasks</b> {{to the general}} internet public.

40|$|Background: Crowdsourcing, i. e., the <b>outsourcing</b> <b>of</b> <b>tasks</b> {{typically}} {{performed by}} a few experts to a large crowd as an open call, {{has been shown to}} be reasonably effective in many cases, like Wikipedia, the Chess match of Kasparov against the world in 1999, and several others. The aim of the present paper is to describe the setup of an experimentation of crowdsourcing techniques applied to the quantification of immunohistochemistry. Methods: Fourteen Images from MIB 1 -stained breast specimens were first manually counted by a pathologist, then submitted to a crowdsourcing platform through a specifically developed application. 10 positivity evaluations for each image have been collected and summarized using their median. The positivity values have been then compared to the gold standard provided by the pathologist by means of Spearman correlation. Results: Contributors were in total 28, and evaluated 4. 64 images each on average. Spearman correlation between gold and crowdsourced positivity percentages is 0. 946 (p < 0. 001). Conclusions: Aim of the experiment was to understand how to use crowdsourcing for an image analysis task that is currently time-consuming when done by human experts. Crowdsourced work can be used in various ways, in particular statistically agregating data to reduce identification errors. However, in this preliminary experimentation we just considered the most basic indicator, that is the median positivity percentage, which provided overall goo...|$|E
40|$|In {{this era}} of {{globalisation}} the traditional Ricardian theory of trade in products governed by comparative advantages {{is replaced by a}} modern theory of trade in tasks. Tasks are outsourced to those places in the world where the lower production costs outweigh the additional transaction costs associated with coordinating the tasks. The labour market consequences of this <b>outsourcing</b> <b>of</b> <b>tasks</b> is a major concern, both for the country that outsources tasks and for the country to which tasks are outsourced. This paper discusses the labour market effects of outsourcing in the Netherlands using a survey amongst human research officers and in depth-interviews with the strategic management of seven industrial companies. The interviews and survey make clear that a major motive for outsourcing is to organise production {{in such a way that}} total production costs are minimized. More outsourcing requires more coordination but the reduction of costs due to producing at a cheap location outweigh the increase in transaction costs so that total production costs fall and productivity increases. However, it brings about a change in the composition of jobs in the outsourcing country: less workers are engaged in sheer production jobs, but more workers have transaction jobs. The net effect on total employment is uncertain, but our survey and interviews show that outsourcing should not necessarily be associated with a loss of jobs...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — As {{the age of}} {{big data}} evolves, <b>outsourcing</b> <b>of</b> data mining <b>tasks</b> to multi-cloud environments has become a popular trend. To ensure the data privacy in <b>outsourcing</b> <b>of</b> mining <b>tasks,</b> the concept <b>of</b> support {{anonymity}} was proposed to hide sensitive information about patterns. Existing methods that tackle the privacy issues, however, do not address the related parallel mining techniques. To fill this gap, we refer to a pseudo-taxonomy based technique, called as k-support anonymity, and improve it into multi-cloud environments with secrete sharing scheme. This has several advantages. First, outsourcing to multi-cloud environments can meet the requirement of great computational resources in big data mining, and also parallelize the mining tasks for better efficiency. Second, the data that we send out to a cloud can be partial. An assaulter who gets the data in one cloud can never re-construct the original data. That means {{it is more difficult}} for an assailant to violate the privacy in outsourced data. Experimental results also demonstrated that our approaches can achieve good protection and better computation efficiency. I...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{the seminal}} paper by Ronald Coase and {{subsequent}} work by Oliver Williamson, Oliver Hart and others, {{explanations for the}} existence of firms typically hinge upon the advantages of internal coordination over the purchase of market services. In recent years, the standard theory of the integrated firm has given way to a concern about the relative advantages of in-sourcing over outsourcing, recognising that the scope of the firm is a strategic matter. The issue of in-sourcing versus outsourcing has been accompanied by a concern about the geographical scope of the firm: whether the <b>outsourcing</b> <b>of</b> <b>tasks</b> and functions is close-at-hand or offshore. In this paper, we begin with reference to Ronald Coase and the literature that has followed in his wake and suggest, in the first instance, a way of conceptualising the tasks and functions of firms which rely upon firm-specific strategic assets including human capital, governance and decision-making procedures, and the information systems that underpin decision-making. The objects of our analysis are financial institutions like pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and investment management institutions. To the extent that the cost of services is important, these types of financial institutions have sought to discount these costs by outsourcing, even offshoring. At issue is the viable geographical reach of this type of institution. In large part, our analysis is conceptual and theoretical rather than directly empirical. Nonetheless, it is based on a set of case studies and fieldwork and the implications to be drawn thereof...|$|E
40|$|If an {{organisation}} {{does not}} seek to make monetary profit, {{what does it do}} and why does it exist? A not-for-profit organisation, or non-profit organisation, exists to provide value to a particular constituency and, generally, it provides this value by offering a set of services. Examples of not-for-profit organisations are: public schools, most colleges and universities, government agencies, social and human service organisations, some hospitals, religious organisations, sports clubs, community theatres, symphony groups, charities and others. Chapter 1 is a summary of the problem statement, methodology and research in this paper. Chapter 2 will discuss definitions and strategies. Chapter 3 examines for-profit organisations, their management characteristics and the strategies they apply. Chapter 4 goes on to discuss not-for-profit organisations and how they are managed. Lastly, Chapter 5 reviews the findings in the previous chapters and makes recommendations. As the cases will reveal, the differences between not-for-profit and for-profit "business decision making" are sometimes subtle, {{but it is clear that}} not-for-profit organisations cannot blindly apply business methods and principles without appropriate adaptation. This necessary caution applies to a wide variety of decisions which include pricing, investment of funds, the <b>outsourcing</b> <b>of</b> <b>tasks,</b> deciding whether to undertake a commercial venture, deciding whether to collaborate with a business corporation, determining employee compensation levels and investment in fund raising operations. Conventional business principles help organisations to run efficiently and effectively, but. they are built on the underlying assumption that the purpose of the organisation is to make as much money as possible. Not-for-profit organisations must also be efficient and effective in their use of resources, but they must do so in a way that maximises the impact of their social missions, and at the same time ensures their financial survival.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores empirically how {{external factors}} {{can influence the}} organizational structure of firms and how the structure a firm chooses can affect worker outcomes. The first chapter examines how a policy reform affected the organizational choices of firms. The MINER Act of 2006 resulted in increased scrutiny and penalties for underground coal mining operations relative to surface operations. In turn, this changed the incentives for coal preparation facilities to own these mines. Particularly, markets most affected by the reform saw an increase in ownership along an extensive margin and markets already integrated saw a decrease along an intensive margin. I argue these results reflect the competing incentives created by the policy. The increased riskiness of shut downs and flows in production resulted in preparation plants integrating {{with at least one}} mine to assure a basic level of supply. The increased regulatory liability of ownership induced by the new regulatory structure resulted in a countervailing force, reducing the intensity of integration in markets that were integrated prior to the reform. The second chapter (with David Weil) studies the prevalence of contractor utilization in the mining industry. <b>Outsourcing</b> <b>of</b> <b>tasks</b> has increased significantly in the underground coal mining industry over the last two decades. We hypothesize that the market and organizational incentives facing contractors increase the likelihood of injuries and fatalities to their workforce. Our results suggest increased risk exposure for mines with high contractor utilization. These findings have important implications for enforcement and public policies and extend the evidence of the adverse impact of forms of subcontracting on health and safety to the mining sector. Finally, the third chapter provides a case study of two major actors in the industry, Alpha Natural Resources and Massey Energy Company. It looks at the ownership choices the two companies have made in the past decade. Looking at these different decisions allows for the identification of contract operations that are of concern from a regulatory standpoint in this industry. This paper provides a blueprint for future research in determining the prevalence of these particular contracting arrangements in US coal mining...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{appropriation}} of ICT by professionals {{of the press}} : a leveling of journalistic practices on a global scale? This work is {{on the theme of}} standard communicative approaches in the organizations. It intends to highlight the reconfiguration of the press Congolese companies, as entrepreneurial ogranizations, in the context of information technology and communication (ICT) usage in the production activities, an usage considered as a key factor of any development on a global scale (Cf. Kiyindou, 2009). This configuration is understood from the evolution of journalistic practices in connection with the use of ICT, especially Internet, in the operations of information processing news. The information processing is understood here as "the manner to do, the mode that the informant decides to report use languages (and icon if it uses the image) the facts that he has selected, depending on predetermined target it {{with the fact that he}} chose to give "(Charaudeau, 1997, p. 37); so this is a mode of writing the information to be disseminated. Indeed, the technological order on the release of the global concept of "information society" has led, in the press, a dynamic development based on the use of Internet in activities of production and diffusion of information. The professional {{appropriation of}} Internet was accompanied by a change in journalistic practices, leading to a new configuration of media companies in the digital age. This reconfiguration can be seen, among others, through the multimodal treatment or multimedia information, segmentation of audiences, the interactive communication, the diversification of media and informational supply (Cf. Damian, Ringoot, Ruellan, Thierry (ed.), 2001). We are particularly interesting in processing multimedia information release, to know if this aspect is part of the reconfiguration of the print media in "Internet era". This aspect seems to be really transversal to the other aspects mentioned, which would also facilitate their implementation. Considered by some practitioners as a way of writing related to the complexity of events to cover and diversity of their modes of reading (Cf. Johannès, 2007), processing multimedia information refers to the technical convergence which would participate in a social and economic trategy linked to the fragmentation of media consumption. Therefore, the computerization of editorial tasks, leading to the achievement of the writings screen, appears as a standard business development release. But that computerization has induced significant changes in the prioritization of tasks within the editorial. At the French press, for example, there is an organizational restructuring between technical service and writing service, thus calling into question the traditional hierarchy of editorial tasks. This redevelopment is observed through the shift from the category of service professionals in the technical service editorial and vice versa (Cf. Mathien, 2007), reinforcing the porosity of the frontier between the two services. Based on this observation, we asked whether the appropriation of ICT by professionals of the press induces around the same reconfiguration of practices. In other words, today do we attend to a leveling of journalistic practices in all areas where the Internet was introduced in the activities of production and diffusion of news? Our hypothesis is that the evolution of professional practices at the press is related both to the use of ICT and the business logic inherent in each socio-political environment. Indeed, beyond the simple observation of these mutations, they are logical ownership of ICT professionals in the press are at stake, because the introduction of Internet in the activities of production and diffusion of news gave rise, to the level of press, two main types of speeches, more catastrophic to the most prophetic. When some practitioners and essayists suggest a possible substitution of electronic media to the clipboard, claiming that the regime of the Internet marked "the end of journalism as it was lived up to" (Fogel, Patino, 2005, p. 16), others say rather an integration perspective, promoting assimilation by the press of the "technological expansion" to "extract promising practices" (Johannès, 2007, p. 13). We are here in the assertion of a dual logic of operation of the press to the "Internet age", the breaking and integration. That suggests a bipolar partitioning of journalistic practices, depending on whether one falls within one or the other logic. Hence there is the need for serious questioning the logic of change underway in this sector of professional activities. And this question can be possible only through "empirical analysis and distanced of any changes in progress" (Rebillard, 2000, p. 142). Thus, studying the case of print media companies in Congo, our analysis reveals the logic of professional appropriation of ICT which are structured around the local traditional practices. Crystallizing around the monopolization of the press-public relationship by the sphere of political action, these logics reveal an appropriation of ICT where the Internet appears more like a simple means of diffusion of traditional content focused on writing and image than a new mode of writing the news. This does not seem to affect the traditional hierarchy of editorial tasks, since the online content is provided by webmasters often outside the company (<b>outsourcing</b> <b>of</b> <b>tasks)</b> or employed only for this task. This perspective relativizes the assertion of a leveling of journalistic practices on a global scale, especially as ICT do not create professional practices "different from those promoted by the media in place" (Miege, 2010, p. 134). To address this issue, we conducted a qualitative survey, through semi-structured interviews with professionals in the Congolese aund the French press. This survey is combined with a literature search and a personal observation of the functioning of a sample of Congolese newspapers, manly La Semaine Africaine and Les Dépêches de Brazzabille. After briefly defined our theoretical framework, mobilizing the concepts of "social anchorage techniques" and "social sphere", developed respectively by Bernard Miege and Pierre Bourdieu, we will analyze the journalistic practices in the "Internet age", building on the grounds of the Congolese press that we will put in perspective with the French example. Cette contribution s'inscrit dans la thématique des approches communicationnelles de la norme dans les organisations. Elle entend mettre en lumière la reconfiguration des entreprises de presse écrite congolaises, en tant qu'organisations entrepreneuriales, dans le cadre de l'usage des technologies de l'information et de la communication (TIC) dans les activités de production, un usage considéré comme facteur clé de tout développement à l'échelle planétaire (Cf. Kiyindou, 2009). Cette reconfiguration est appréhendée à partir de l'évolution des pratiques journalistiques, en lien avec l'usage des TIC, particulièrement d'Internet, dans les opérations de traitement de l'information de presse. Le traitement de l'information se comprend ici comme " la manière de faire, la façon dont l'informateur décide de rapporter langagièrement (et iconiquement s'il a recours à l'image) les faits qu'il a sélectionnés, en fonction de la cible qu'il a prédéterminée, avec l'effet qu'il a choisi de donner " (Charaudeau, 1997, p. 37); il s'agit donc d'un mode d'écriture de l'information à diffuser. En effet, l'injonction technologique relative à la dissémination planétaire de la notion de " société de l'information " a induit, au niveau de la presse, une dynamique de développement basée sur l'usage d'Internet dans les activités de production et de diffusion de l'actualité. Aussi l'appropriation professionnelle d'Internet s'est-elle accompagnée d'une évolution des pratiques journalistiques, entraînant du coup une reconfiguration des entreprises de presse à l'ère du tout numérique. Cette reconfiguration peut s'observer, entre autres, à travers le traitement multimodal ou multimédiatique de l'information, la segmentation des publics, l'interactivité de la communication, la diversification de l'offre informationnelle et des supports de diffusion, etc. (Cf. Damian, Ringoot, Ruellan, Thierry (dir.), 2002). Nous nous intéressons particulièrement au traitement multimédiatique de l'information de presse, pour essayer de montrer comment cet aspect participe de la reconfiguration des entreprises de presse écrite à l'" ère d'Internet ". Cet aspect paraît en effet transversal aux autres aspects mentionnés, dont il faciliterait par ailleurs la mise en œuvre. Considéré par certains praticiens comme un mode d'écriture lié à la complexité des événements à couvrir et à la diversité de leurs modes de lectures (Cf. Joannès, 2007), le traitement multimédiatique de l'information renvoie à la convergence technique qui, cette dernière, participerait d'une stratégie socioéconomique liée à la fragmentation de la consommation médiatique. Dès lors, l'informatisation des tâches rédactionnelles, conduisant à la réalisation des écrits d'écran, apparaît comme une norme de développement des entreprises de presse. Mais cette informatisation a induit des mutations significatives dans la hiérarchisation des tâches au sein des rédactions. Au niveau de la presse française, par exemple, l'on assiste à un réaménagement organisationnel entre les services techniques et ceux de la rédaction proprement dite, remettant ainsi en cause la hiérarchisation traditionnelle des tâches rédactionnelles. Ce réaménagement s'observe à travers le glissement de la catégorie des professionnels du service technique dans celle du service rédactionnel, et vice-versa (Cf. Mathien, 2007), renforçant ainsi la porosité de la frontière entre les deux services. Fort de ce constat, nous nous sommes posé la question de savoir si l'appropriation d'Internet par les professionnels de la presse induit partout la même reconfiguration des pratiques. En d'autres termes, assisterait-on aujourd'hui à un nivellement des pratiques journalistiques dans toutes les zones géographiques où l'Internet a été introduit dans les activités de production et de diffusion de l'information de presse ? Notre hypothèse est que l'évolution des pratiques professionnelles au niveau de la presse est autant liée à l'usage des TIC qu'à des logiques professionnelles inhérentes à chaque environnement sociopolitique. En effet, au-delà du simple constat de ces mutations, ce sont des logiques d'appropriation professionnelle des TIC dans la presse qui sont en jeu. Car l'introduction d'Internet dans les activités de production et de diffusion de l'information a donné lieu, au niveau de la presse écrite, à deux principaux types de discours, des plus catastrophistes aux plus prophétiques. Quand certains praticiens et essayistes évoquent l'éventualité d'une substitution de la presse électronique à la presse papier, en prétendant que le régime d'Internet marquait " la fin du journalisme tel qu'il a été vécu jusqu'ici " (Fogel, Patino, 2005, p. 16), d'autres affirment plutôt une perspective d'intégration, en prônant l'assimilation par la presse écrite des " innovations technologiques foisonnantes " pour " en extraire des usages porteurs d'avenir " (Joannès, 2007, p. 13). On retrouve là l'affirmation d'une double logique de fonctionnement de la presse écrite à l'"ère d'Internet ", la rupture et l'intégration. Ce qui laisse penser à un cloisonnement bipolaire des pratiques journalistiques, suivant que l'on s'inscrit dans l'une ou l'autre logique. D'où la nécessité d'un questionnement sérieux sur les logiques de changement en cours dans ce secteur d'activités professionnelles. Et ce questionnement ne peut être possible qu'à travers " des analyses empiriques et distanciées des éventuels changements en cours " (Cf. Rebillard, 2000, p. 142). Ainsi, étudiant le cas des entreprises de presse écrite congolaises, notre analyse révèle des logiques d'appropriation professionnelle des TIC qui sont structurées autour des réalités économico-politiques locales. Se cristallisant autour de la monopolisation de la relation presse-publics par le champ de l'action politique, ces logiques révèlent une appropriation des TIC où l'Internet apparaît plutôt comme un simple moyen de diffusion d'un contenu traditionnellement centré sur l'écrit et l'image fixe qu'un nouveau mode d'écriture de l'actualité. Ce qui ne semble pas affecter la hiérarchisation traditionnelle des tâches rédactionnelles, puisque la mise en ligne du contenu est assurée par des webmasters souvent externes à l'entreprise (externalisation des tâches) ou embauchés uniquement pour cette tâche. Pour traiter ce sujet, nous avons procédé par une enquête qualitative, à travers des entretiens semi-directifs avec des professionnels de la presse aussi bien congolaise que française. Cette enquête est doublée d'une recherche documentaire et d'une observation personnelle du fonctionnement de quelques journaux congolais, principalement La Semaine Africaine et Les Dépêches de Brazzaville. Après avoir brièvement défini notre cadre théorique, en mobilisant les notions d'" ancrage social des techniques " et de " champ social ", développées respectivement par Bernard Miège et Pierre Bourdieu, nous analysons les pratiques journalistiques à l'" ère d'Internet ", en nous appuyant sur le terrain de la presse congolaise que nous mettrons en perspective avec l'exemple français...|$|E

In Section  5 we show a possible distributed scenario for privacy preserving mobility analytics, while in Section  6 we present a study of privacy issues of a socio-meter of urban population and propose a schema for guaranteeing user privacy protection. Lastly, Section  7 concludes the paper.|$|R
50|$|In {{a diverse}} global economy, <b>outsourcing</b> <b>of</b> {{production}} <b>tasks</b> {{is a common}} way to lower a product's cost. Embedded hardware devices are not always produced by the firms that design and/or sell them, nor in the same country {{where they will be}} used. Outsourced manufacturing can raise doubt about the evidence for the integrity of the manufactured product (i.e., one's certainty that the end-product has no design modifications compared to its original design). Anyone with access to the manufacturing process could, in theory, introduce some change to the final product. For complex products, small changes with large effects can be difficult to detect.|$|R
40|$|Last decade, {{offshore}} <b>outsourcing</b> <b>of</b> {{software development}} from developed countries to undeveloped countries became very popular and caused {{an increase in}} the rate of unemployment of IT staff in developed countries {{as well as in the}} rate of employment of IT staff in undeveloped countries. While offshore <b>outsourcing</b> <b>of</b> work-intensive <b>tasks</b> in textile industry or furniture industry can be considered as colonization, based on profit and economy reasons, offshore <b>outsourcing</b> <b>of</b> high-tech jobs, such as those found in information technology and software development, caused huge changes on both sides. Although many of these changes and positive and negative trends have been established, supporters and opponents are very far from common agreement. Besides discussion about the positive and negative aspects <b>of</b> globalization and <b>outsourcing,</b> this paper offers insight in the <b>outsourcing</b> <b>of</b> the high-tech jobs, especially in the Nordic countries, supported by statistical data over the last decade, and tried to provide an answer to the question of who has the most interest in outsourcing and globalizatio...|$|R
50|$|Non-equity {{strategic}} alliances, which cover a wide {{field of}} possible cooperation between companies. This {{can range from}} close relations between customer and supplier, to <b>outsourcing</b> <b>of</b> certain corporate <b>tasks</b> or licensing, to vast networks in R&D. This cooperation can either be an informal alliance which is not contractually designated, which appears mostly among smaller enterprises, or the alliance can be set by a contract.|$|R
40|$|Collaboration and {{mobility}} are two actual trends in new product development today. Due to {{the globalization of}} the economies and the <b>outsourcing</b> <b>of</b> specific <b>tasks,</b> companies {{have to work together}} as Virtual Organisations. However, the work environments of the collaborating people are very complex. In every company different processes and IT systems are used. Additionally, people are seldom at their company site, especially in small and medium sized companies (SME) the key personnel are often on the road. There they have no access to their digital files and information resources of their companies. This paper describes the architecture concept of a mobile collaborative environment addressing these problems...|$|R
5000|$|In many countries, {{neoliberal}} {{reforms of}} government have included expanding the <b>outsourcing</b> <b>of</b> government <b>tasks</b> and functions to private businesses {{with the aim}} of improving efficiency and effectiveness in government administration. However, among the criticisms of these reforms is the claim that the pervasive use of [...] "Commercial-in-confidence" [...] (or secrecy) clauses in contracts between government and private providers further limits public accountability of governments and prevents proper public scrutiny of the performance and probity of the private companies. Concerns have been raised that 'commercial-in-confidence' is open to abuse because it can be deliberately used to hide corporate or government maladministration and even corruption.|$|R
40|$|Outsouring practises {{imply the}} {{creation}} of new information profesonal profiles and new markets for developint their work. Some examples <b>of</b> <b>outsourcing</b> <b>tasks</b> which can be carried out in the Information Management field are provided. The importance of information professionals in the development <b>of</b> <b>outsourcing</b> services, the costs cutting in management, and the possibility of a better management are uderlined. Finally, some models for future development are proposed...|$|R
40|$|The <b>outsourcing</b> <b>of</b> {{domestic}} <b>tasks</b> is {{an important}} strategy for coping with the competing time claims {{of the family and}} the workplace. Previous research explained the use of domestic help mainly in terms of financial and time constraints. In this article, we conceptualize household work as producing not only goods but also direct utility, and we argue that the more pleasure household members take in doing domestic work, the less they outsource it. Using the Dutch Time Competition Survey (N = 736), we find that if partners enjoy maintenance, cleaning, cooking, or child care, {{they are less likely to}} outsource these tasks, controlling for time and monetary resources and gender-role expectations. A woman’s preferences are more important for the <b>outsourcing</b> <b>of</b> cleaning and child care, whereas a man’s preferences are more important for the <b>outsourcing</b> <b>of</b> home maintenance. Cooking is less likely to be outsourced when both men and women find it pleasurable to cook themselves...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. While {{expensive}} cryptographically verifiable computation aims at defeating malicious agents, many civil purposes <b>of</b> <b>outsourced</b> compu-tation {{tolerate a}} weaker notion of security, i. e., “lazy-but-honest ” con-tractors. Targeting {{this type of}} agents, we develop optimal contracts for <b>outsourcing</b> <b>of</b> computational <b>tasks</b> via appropriate use of rewards, punishments, auditing rate, and “redundancy”. Our contracts provably minimize the expense <b>of</b> the <b>outsourcer</b> (principal) while guaranteeing correct computation. Furthermore, we incorporate practical restrictions of the maximum enforceable fine, limited and/or costly auditing, and bounded budget <b>of</b> the <b>outsourcer.</b> By examining the optimal contracts, we provide insights on how resources should be utilized when auditing ca-pacity and enforceability are limited. Finally, we present a light-weight cryptographic implementation of the contracts to mitigate the double moral hazard problem between the principal and the agents. ...|$|R
