During the voyage north, the airmen {{received}} detailed briefings on the attack plans and terrain around Kaafjord and were also issued with escape kits to use if they were shot down over Norway. Maintenance personnel also worked to ensure that as many aircraft as possible would be ready. The twelve German submarines in the Norwegian Sea did not {{make contact with the}} British force as it sailed north. The weather for much of the voyage was foggy, but the skies were clear when the fleet reached its flying <b>off</b> <b>position</b> to the north of Kaafjord in the evening of 16 July.|$|E

25|$|A {{check valve}} lets gas flow in one {{direction}} only. It is usually a chamber containing a ball that is pressed against one end by a spring. Gas flow one way pushes {{the ball out of}} the way, and a lack of flow or a reverse flow allows the spring to push the ball into the inlet, blocking it. Not to be confused with a flashback arrestor, a check valve is not designed to block a shock wave. The shock wave could occur while the ball is so far from the inlet that the wave will get past the ball before it can reach its <b>off</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E
25|$|Expression {{of certain}} genes, for example those coding for pilus {{expression}} in E. coli, is {{regulated by the}} methylation of GATC sites in the promoter region of the gene operon. The cells' environmental conditions just after DNA replication determine whether Dam is blocked from methylating a region proximal to or distal from the promoter region. Once the pattern of methylation has been created, the pilus gene transcription is locked in the on or <b>off</b> <b>position</b> until the DNA is again replicated. In E. coli, these pilus operons have important roles in virulence in urinary tract infections. It has been proposed that inhibitors of Dam may function as antibiotics.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a variety}} of router styles, some are plunge, some are D handled, some are double knob handled. Different {{manufacturers}} produce the routers for different wood works, as Plunge Routers, Fixed Base Wood Routers, Combo Routers, Variable speed Routers, Laminate Trimmer, CNC Wood Routers. Nowadays, most better quality routers have variable speed controls and will have plunge bases that can also be locked in place so the router can also be used as a fixed base router. Some have a soft-start feature, meaning they build up speed gradually. This feature is particularly desirable for routers with a large cutter. Holding a 3 horse-power router and turning it on without a soft-start is potentially dangerous, due to the torque of the motor. Holding it with two hands is a must. For routers with a toggle type on / off switch it is important to check to verify the switch is in the <b>off</b> <b>position,</b> prior to plugging it in. For safety, larger router cutters can usually only be used in a router that is mounted in a router table, this makes the tool even more versatile and stable.|$|E

500|$|Razer {{dropped into}} the [...] "best of the rest" [...] competition. Therein it faced Kill-O-Amp which was {{defeated}} after Razer pulled a wheel off before crushing its opponent's battery. It then faced Rhino in the next round, losing after Rhino's spike pierced Razer's armour, breaking the starter solenoid and knocking the radio switch into the <b>off</b> <b>position.</b> This also sent Razer into an uncontrolled spin, requiring Lewis to enter the arena to manually power Razer down. Finally, Razer competed in the 13 robot Gigabot Rumble. After the time limit expired, five robots including Razer were still mobile and the result went to an audience vote. After the crowd voted in their favour, Razer became the 1999 Gigabot Rumble Champion.|$|E
500|$|Situated in the Americal Division's sector, Hill 260 {{was located}} about [...] outside the main {{perimeter}} line, {{on the southern}} approaches to the Torokina perimeter. An hourglass-shaped feature consisting of two rounded hills {{to the north and}} south [...] dubbed [...] "North Knob" [...] and [...] "South Knob" [...] the position was essentially a saddle, albeit one separated by a very narrow handle. The US forces had established an outpost on the feature which was occupied by a reinforced platoon from G Company of the 182nd Regiment and a party of artillery observers; the total strength of this isolated force on 10March was about 80 men. A platform had been erected [...] up a tree for the observers (called [...] "OP tree"), and the heavily forested hill was protected by a network of pillboxes and bunkers, which had been constructed out of sandbags and logs. During the night of 9/10March small parties from the Muda Unit, having assembled at Peko before moving along the EastWest Trail, had infiltrated the [...] gap between Hill 260 and the main American perimeter {{while the rest of the}} Japanese force moved into its jumping <b>off</b> <b>position</b> east of the hill.

He executed some delayed steals by taking {{off with the}} toss back to the mound [...] "when neither infielder is covering second and the catcher is nonchalant with the ball after receiving the pitch". On April 11 against the Atlanta Braves, he had his first career 5-RBI game, falling a double shy of the first cycle in Padres history. On May 19, Venable moved into the lead <b>off</b> <b>position</b> in the lineup and he fell a home run shy of the franchise's first cycle against the Los Angeles Dodgers, going 4-for-5 at the plate after getting a triple in the 1st inning and a double in the third. In June 23, June 25 and 27, Venable hit tie-breaking home runs in Padre victories against the Florida Marlins and Tampa Bay Rays. On July 3, {{he went on the}} 15-day disabled list due to back problems. On September 29 against the Chicago Cubs, he stole two potential home runs (from Alfonso Soriano and Aramis Ramírez) on deep fly balls. In the game, he achieved his career-high 10-game hitting streak. He also led National League outfielders with 5 errors. He set new career-highs with 13 home runs and 51 RBI. Again, the majority of his innings were in right field (600.1 of 936.1 innings). He split his remaining time between left field (171.2) and center field (164.1).|$|E

He was one of 64 Australians to receive the award for their actions during the First World War, receiving it as a result of deeds performed during the Battle of Mont St Quentin on 1 September 1918. That day, Mactier was a battalion runner serving with the 23rd Battalion, Australian Imperial Force. He was sent forward by an officer to determine the cause of a delay in the battalion moving into its jumping <b>off</b> <b>position.</b> The cause was a well placed enemy machine gun. On his own initiative, Mactier jumped out of the trench and charged the gun, killing its crew of six. He then charged two other machine guns, killing more crews and causing at least 40 enemy to surrender. He was killed by fire from a fourth machine gun, but not before enabling his battalion to form up on time.|$|E
