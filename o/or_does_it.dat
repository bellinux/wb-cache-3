25|$|Neurological {{research}} {{takes an}} empirical approach, relating mystical experiences to neurological processes. This {{leads to a}} central philosophical issue: does the identification of neural triggers or neural correlates of mystical experiences prove that mystical experiences {{are no more than}} brain events <b>or</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> merely identify the brain activity occurring during a genuine cognitive event? The most common positions are that neurology reduces mystical experiences or that neurology is neutral to the issue of mystical cognitivity.|$|E
500|$|Michael Atkinson, {{writing for}} Sight & Sound, {{reviewed}} Aronofsky's endeavor, [...] "It's difficult to recall another American film that, in pursuing a passionate and personal vision, goes so maddeningly, uproariously wrong." [...] Atkinson {{said of the}} narrative, [...] "The erratic and pointless leapfrogging between its storylines is torporific... all three stories are assembled piecemeal, many of which repeat over and over as flashback and flashforwards." [...] He complained of the numerous motifs, [...] "It's difficult to swallow the amalgamation of Mayan, Biblical, Buddhist, Taoist and New Age iconography, all of it tossed as if into a stew." [...] In contrast, Glenn Kenny of Premiere wrote of the film, [...] "The Fountain is probably the deftest stories-within-stories narrative film I've seen... By The Fountains end, the multilayered meta-narrative... resolves (<b>or</b> <b>does</b> <b>it?)</b> {{into a kind of}} diegetic Möbius strip, to stunning effect." [...] Kenny called the film [...] "as demanding as it is dazzling" [...] and compared Aronofsky's direction to Stanley Kubrick's [...] "in terms of conceptual audacity and meticulousness of execution." [...] He concluded, [...] "It's a movie that's as deeply felt as it is imagined." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lenglen was criticised widely for her {{decision}} to turn professional, and the All England Club at Wimbledon even revoked her honorary membership. Lenglen, however, described {{her decision}} as [...] "an escape from bondage and slavery" [...] and said in the tour programme, [...] "In the twelve years I have been champion I have earned literally millions of francs for tennis and have paid thousands of francs in entrance fees {{to be allowed to}} do so.... I have worked as hard at my career as any man or woman has worked at any career. And in my whole lifetime I have not earned $5,000 – not one cent of that by my specialty, my life study – tennis.... I am twenty-seven and not wealthy – should I embark on any other career and leave the one for which I have what people call genius? [...] Or should I smile at the prospect of actual poverty and continue to earn a fortune – for whom?" [...] As for the amateur tennis system, Lenglen said, [...] "Under these absurd and antiquated amateur rulings, only a wealthy person can compete, {{and the fact of the}} matter is that only wealthy people do compete. Is that fair? [...] Does it advance the sport? [...] Does it make tennis more popular – <b>or</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> tend to suppress and hinder an enormous amount of tennis talent lying dormant in the bodies of young men and women whose names are not in the social register?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Late in {{the run of}} the strip, and {{following}} a renewal of Hart's religious faith in 1984, B.C. increasingly incorporated religious, social, and political commentary, continuing until Hart's death in 2007. References to Christianity, anachronistic given the strip's supposed setting and the implications of its title, became increasingly frequent during Hart's later years. [...] In interviews, Hart referred to his strip as a [...] "ministry" [...] intended to mix religious themes with secular humor. Though other strips such as The Family Circus and Peanuts have included Christian themes, B.C. strips were pulled from comics pages on several occasions due to editorial perception of religious favoritism or overt proselytizing. Easter strips in 1996 and 2001, for example, prompted editorial reaction from a handful of U.S. newspapers, chiefly the Los Angeles Times and written and oral responses from Jewish and Muslim groups. [...] The American Jewish Committee termed the Easter 2001 strip, which depicted the last words of Jesus Christ and a menorah transforming into a cross, [...] "religiously offensive" [...] and [...] "shameful." [...] A 2003 strip depicting a character using an outhouse with a crescent symbol on the front, slamming the door shut, and declaring, [...] "Is it just me, <b>or</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> stink in here?" [...] was interpreted by some as carrying an anti-Islam message. Hart responded to the controversy, saying [...] "This comic was in no way intended to be a message against Islam — subliminal or otherwise.... It would be contradictory to my own faith as a Christian to insult other people’s beliefs." [...] The Los Angeles Times consequently relegated strips which its editorial staff deemed objectionable to the religion pages, instead of the regular comics pages.|$|E
