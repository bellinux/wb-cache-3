40|$|Two feedlot {{trials were}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effects of feeding frequency (<b>once</b> daily <b>in</b> the morning, <b>once</b> daily <b>in</b> the afternoon or twice daily) and feeding level (ad libitum, 95 % of ad libitum, or 90 % of ad libitum) on the feedlot performance and carcass composition of beef steers.
