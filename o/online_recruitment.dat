40|$|Abstract This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} effectiveness of <b>online</b> graduate <b>recruitment.</b> The Internet offers tremendous potential benefits to companies and job-seekers, in particular great time and costs savings. The speed, ease of use and widespread availability of the Internet, make this medium particularly popular with graduates, who view the Internet as {{a major source of}} job opportunities. However, evidence suggests that many companies face difficulty in using the Internet effectively, in particular when they are recruiting large volumes of job applicants such as graduates, as they are struggling to cope with the high amount of unsuitable applications. As the existing literature on <b>online</b> graduate <b>recruitment</b> is fairly limited, this study explores the experiences and opinions of graduates with regards to <b>online</b> graduate <b>recruitment</b> and provides an in-depth understanding of the issues that graduates identified as useful or problematic when using the Internet as a means of looking and applying for jobs. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a sample of eight international Master students of the Nottingham University Business School (NUBS). The results of these interviews indicate that the graduates perceive the Internet as a fast and efficient job search tool that provides immediate access to a lot of up-to-date information. However, the interview data also suggest that the graduates experience major difficulties as they look and apply for a job on the Internet. The factors that hinder the effective use of the Internet are the lack of relevant and specific information about the job and the company on a company's Web site, extremely long and time-consuming application forms, as well as poor Web site layouts and user-unfriendly Web site navigation. Other factors that the graduates identified as problematic are insufficient and slow feedback as well as low degree of personal contact. This research project provides a discussion of these issues, in which it is argued that <b>online</b> graduate <b>recruitment</b> is to a large extent ineffective. Furthermore, this study considers the implications of these results for management practice and concludes with recommendations for improving {{the effectiveness of}} <b>online</b> graduate <b>recruitment...</b>|$|R
