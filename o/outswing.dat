25|$|John Alfred 'Jack' Newman (born 12 November 1884 at Southsea, Hampshire; died 21 December 1973 at Groote Schuur, Cape Town, South Africa) was an English cricketer {{who played}} for Hampshire. He was an all-rounder, a {{right-handed}} batsman and right-arm bowler, able to bowl fast-medium <b>outswing</b> with the new ball and then brisk offspin.|$|E
25|$|Bowlers {{aimed to}} bring the ball in to him {{to get him out}} since against <b>outswing,</b> 'he was the best', as Kapil Dev noted when asked about the best batsmen he had bowled to after he had become the highest wicket-taker in 1994. These {{attributes}} made him unconquerable on English wickets where medium-pace and finger-spin was the staple on soft, wickets with little bounce.|$|E
25|$|He reached 100 test wickets in only 21 Test matches. A {{powerful}} fast bowler with {{a talent}} for <b>outswing,</b> severe back injuries cut him down in 1991. He rehabilitated strongly and made adjustments to his bowling action, returning strongly late in 1992. however in 1993, {{he was struck by}} injuries again, not returning until mid 1995, thus what was at one stage a highly promising career had been substantially reduced.|$|E
5000|$|Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly commends {{director}} Gunnarsson for his [...] "focus on {{the more}} interesting psychology of tribalism." [...] Bill Gallo of Village Voice writes, [...] "It's good, bloody fun that stirs the intellect whenever it feels like it, and as a swashbuckler, the dead-game Butler <b>outswings</b> just about anyone in Troy or Kingdom of Heaven or Tristan & Isolde." ...|$|R
5000|$|One of the {{key factors}} in cricket bowling is the grip. Variation in grip has a major {{influence}} on the outcome of a delivery. Below is the grip for an inswing delivery. To produce the grip for an <b>outswinging</b> delivery, you simply have place your fingers {{on the other side of}} the seam. For a right hander you would slightly angle the seam so that it faced towards first slip.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ball was}} spread to Forest's lugubrious but skilful winger John Robertson wide {{on the left}} and he took on two {{defenders}} at once to reach the byline and curl an awkward, <b>outswinging</b> cross towards the far post. Francis had already begun to sprint into position, but even so he had to increase his pace in order to reach the cross as it dropped, and ended up throwing himself low at the ball. He connected with his head and the ball diverted powerfully into the roof of the net. Forest won the match 1-0 and footage of the goal was used in the opening titles to Match of the Day for some years afterwards. A giant picture of Francis stooping to head the ball remains on display in the main entrance and reception area of Forest's City Ground stadium.|$|R
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the stock delivery, an arm ball is delivered with rolling the fingers {{down the back of}} the ball on release. This means the ball has backspin on it, and it does not turn appreciably off the pitch. Instead, it travels straight on {{in the direction of the}} arm, from which it derives its name. However, by keeping the seam upright, the bowler can also hope to obtain some <b>outswing</b> away from the right-handed batsman, thereby confusing the batsman who expects the ball to turn.|$|E
25|$|Zimbabwe {{lost this}} match {{in the first}} three and the last ten overs, {{fighting}} well for the other 85. They lost Sibanda and Masakadza in the third over to the left-arm seamer R. P. Singh, who celebrated his ODI debut with two wickets in his second over, and Ajit Agarkar tied down the other end with accurate <b>outswing.</b> However, Brendan Taylor and Tatenda Taibu fought back with boundaries through the third man and point regions, building a partnership of 46 for the third wicket before Yuvraj Singh was responsible for his third run out of the tournament, forcing down the stumps at the striker's end with a well-timed throw.|$|E
25|$|Fisher {{was born}} into a cricketing family; his father Alexander played three matches for Queensland in the 1930s. Fisher {{modelled}} his action on the great Australian bowler Ray Lindwall who was widely regarded as the best fast bowler of the late 1940s and early 1950s. Lindwall had a classical side on action which imparted <b>outswing</b> at high pace. Fisher made his first-class debut for Queensland against New South Wales during the 195455 season when Lindwall was on international duty and left a vacancy in the team. Fisher made an impressive debut, taking match figures of 8/128. Fisher was unable to hold down a regular place in the Queensland side until 195758 season.|$|E
25|$|Australia resumed play on {{the second}} day with the ball only six overs old, while England's Paul Collingwood {{required}} two runs to make a century. Collingwood made his runs in the second over of the morning, off the second ball he faced. Kevin Pietersen made his own century later in the morning. England again scored relatively slowly, but survived the first session without losing a wicket to be 347 for 3 at lunch. The two batsmen continued after lunch in a session that would go on to break several previous partnership records for English batting. Collingwood increased his score to a personal best innings of 206, becoming only the third Englishman to score a double-century in Australia, and the first in seventy years. He was out caught behind by Adam Gilchrist from an <b>outswinging</b> Stuart Clark delivery on the final ball before tea. After the interval, Pietersen went on to make 158 before being run out. Collingwood, and particularly Pietersen, consistently attacked the Australian bowlers, forcing them to take up defensive fielding positions {{for the first time in}} the series. Noticeably, Shane Warne bowled defensively outside leg stump from around the wicket to Pietersen, having exhausted all other methods of containment. Andrew Flintoff and Ashley Giles added sixty runs for the sixth wicket before the innings was declared at 551/6.|$|R
500|$|Despite {{conditions}} {{conducive to}} swing bowling, New Zealand's captain, Tiffen, chose to bat first {{after winning the}} toss. England opened the bowling with seam from one end, provided by Katherine Brunt, and spin at the other, from Isa Guha. Brunt's bowling spell was described by the BBC's Aimee Lewis as [...] "superb", and teammate Shaw credited her with putting the New Zealand batsmen under pressure. New Zealand progressed to 46 {{for the loss of}} just the opener Pulford, before England made their first bowling change. The England vice-captain, Shaw, was brought on, and made an immediate impact. From her third ball, Bates mistimed an attempted loft over mid-on, and was caught by Atkins. The following ball, Satterthwaite fell for a duck, edging an <b>outswinging</b> delivery to the wicket-keeper, Sarah Taylor. Four overs later, Tiffen was also dismissed by Shaw, providing a thick edge to Sarah Taylor. Although middle-order batsmen McGlashan and Mason both got starts, New Zealand collapsed to 101 for seven. Doolan joined Browne at the crease, and the pair provided their side with some degree of a recovery: Doolan scored 48 runs in a partnership of 63 to help New Zealand to their total of 166. After the dismissal of Doolan, who was stumped off a wide delivery, New Zealand subsided rapidly, losing their final two wickets for just two more runs. The New Zealand Herald criticised the batting as being [...] "indifferent", but Richards credited England for their [...] "tight bowling and fielding" [...] to restrict New Zealand.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the end of}} 1974, West Ham manager John Lyall signed Taylor for Â£40,000. He {{was able}} to play in West Ham's FA Cup {{campaign}} when they joined the competition at the third round stage in January 1975, even though Rochdale's lower league status meant that they had started two rounds earlier. Taylor had been injured during Rochdale's FA Cup matches and was therefore not cup-tied.West Ham progressed to the quarter finals and on 8 March 1975 Taylor scored both goals, in what was only his fifth West Ham game, as they beat Arsenal 2-0 at Highbury. The semi-final against Ipswich Town ended goalless {{and went to a}} replay at Stamford Bridge on 9 April 1975, with Taylor again scoring both goals in a 2-1 win, the second of which clinched a place in the Wembley final with just eight minutes to go.In the final on 3 May 1975, West Ham played Fulham, who were a division below them, and the game was tightly-contested until Taylor scored two goals which won West Ham the FA Cup. In the 61st minute, Billy Jennings hit a low, <b>outswinging</b> shot from 25 yards which Fulham goalkeeper Peter Mellor could only parry across his goal. Taylor, following up, had to check his run to reach the rebound, but managed to get his foot around the ball and place a low drive through Mellor's legs and into the net. Three minutes later, Graham Paddon again hit a shot from a wide left position at the Fulham goal, but this time it was more directly at Mellor, who stopped it but failed to hold on. Once more, Taylor was following up and he guided the rebound into the top of the net. Taylor made headlines as West Ham won 2-0, especially as he had scored three consecutive FA Cup braces and had been a player in the lowest division of English football just six months previously. He was the subject of [...] "rags to riches"-style features in the press after the final.|$|R
25|$|McDermott was {{a rhythm}} bowler. When his rhythm was right, {{he would have}} an {{aggressive}} approach to the wicket and an excellent sideways-on action, giving him sharp pace and <b>outswing.</b> He always saved his best for England, taking 32 wickets in the last full series {{that he was able}} to play before injuries took over. Injuries seemed to hit him at wrong times, and he missed the history-making West Indies tour of 1995, and most of the 1996 World Cup. He also missed most of the 1993 Ashes tour when Shane Warne and Merv Hughes shared the spoils in his absence. His best bowling analysis in Tests is 8/97 against England in 1991. He ended with 291 wickets from 70 Tests and 203 one-day wickets with the best analysis being the 5/44.|$|E
25|$|Finally after Australia {{ended their}} innings on 323, the Indian openers Chopra and Virender Sehwag faced the uphill task of facing 35 overs of {{high-quality}} swing and seam bowling, which was {{aided by a}} track which had enough grass on it {{to suggest that it}} would assist seam movement. Further, the overcast and gloomy skies did not bode too well for the Indian openers. Taking advantage of these conditions and the fact that Chopra was playing in only his third test, Jason Gillespie produced an incisive spell of bowling. His very first ball indicated {{that there would be a}} touch of <b>outswing</b> for him. He stuck the right length time and again, and he beat Chopra's edge frequently, making him play and miss. However, if he was beaten, Chopra did not betray any sign of that fact and played out the two frontline bowlers with assurance. Sehwag was beaten time and again by Nathan bracken, who, despite playing only his first test, generated a lot of bounce with his natural high-arm action and dominated Sehwag throughout. Sehwag, though treated his sluggish start without the slightest care and played on with nonchalance. Both of the openers made five each and India had reached 11/0 from 6.1 overs when play was concluded at that stage.|$|E
2500|$|As a cricketer, Small did {{not have}} an {{outstanding}} reputation but was highly regarded as a committed team player. Primarily he bowled <b>outswing,</b> but his propensity for unreliable bowling gave selectors cause for concern. However, during the 1986-87 Ashes, Small was a last minute replacement for the fourth Test, and rose to the challenge, taking 5-48 in Australia's first innings and claiming two wickets in the second. He was given the Man of the Match award, but this was to be the highlight of his career.|$|E
2500|$|A right-arm fast-medium bowler, {{dependable}} right-handed batsman {{and strong}} fielder, {{often in the}} slips or at leg gully, Bailey played 61 Tests for England between 1949 and 1959. His swing bowling provided an effective foil for the fast bowling of Alec Bedser, and later Fred Trueman, Brian Statham and Frank Tyson. He is described as having had [...] "a model high, sideways-on action which encouraged <b>outswing.</b> At his best he could touch greatness..." [...] He took 132 wickets at the bowling average of 29, scored a century (134 not out) in attaining a useful batting average of nearly 30, and took 32 catches.|$|E
2500|$|His best Test bowling {{figures of}} 7/34, bowling <b>outswing</b> {{on a flat}} pitch, enabled England to bowl out the West Indies for 139 in the first innings of the fifth Test at Kingston, Jamaica, in 1953â54, on a pitch on which the groundsman {{expected}} the home side to score 700. This enabled England to win the match and to share the series 2â2. [...] He was vice-captain on that tour, and may be considered unlucky never to have been appointed captain of England. According to Alan Gibson: [...] "It is astonishing that so good a cricketer, so thoughtful a judge, and so friendly a man, should have been passed over." [...] However, he adds: [...] "He is, or was in his earlier days, a man of contradictions, who sometimes enjoyed being irritating, to his captain, to his colleagues, to the public, {{but most of all}} to his opponents." ...|$|E
2500|$|Between 1986 and 1988, Dilley took 83 Test wickets at {{an average}} of 26.43, and was {{generally}} regarded as England's foremost strike bowler. He developed significant pace and <b>outswing</b> from a long, wide run up, approaching the wicket at an angle almost 45 degrees. [...] Perhaps his most significant success came in 1986/87 when he took 5â68 in the first innings of the first Test at Brisbane to help his team to a victory that set them on their way to an Ashes win, and he also took 20 wickets at 15.85 in ODIs. In the drawn series against New Zealand the following winter he produced his career-best bowling figures, ripping through the Kiwi line-up with 6â38 (including the first five wickets to fall) at Lancaster Park, Christchurch. He was fined Â£250 in the same match for swearing at the umpire, comments which were clearly picked up by the stump microphone. He took a further 5â60 in Auckland, and finished the series with fifteen wickets {{at an average}} of 14.|$|E
2500|$|Cork {{featured}} in the Pakistani tour of England in 2001 and after four years he was recalled {{to play in the}} ODI series involving Pakistan and Australia. [...] Cork had limited success upon his recall, taking six wickets at an average of 35.83. [...] He later played in the 2nd Test of the 2001 Ashes at Lord's, scoring 24 runs in England first-innings before being dismissed by Jason Gillespie. [...] In England's second-innings he scored just 2 runs before being dismissed by Glenn McGrath. [...] He was ineffective with the ball, taking just a single wicket in the match, that of Steve Waugh in the Australians first-innings. [...] Cork later played a single Test against Sri Lanka in 2002 and played his final Tests in two matches against India. [...] Cork's final ODI appearances for England came in the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy against India and Zimbabwe. [...] He had little success and had seemed to lose his ability to <b>outswing</b> the ball, resorting to bowling the bouncer more often and increased sledging toward opponents.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{good example}} of seam bowling {{technique}} are the fast bowlers Courtney Walsh & Curtly Ambrose. [...] Close-up camera work of the following descriptions can be viewed for example at:. [...] Both Walsh & Ambrose used a forward wrist flick that imparted back-spin to the ball as it left the hand. [...] However, significantly, their choice of finger position causes the ball to exhibit precession (similar to a gyroscope), with the seam remaining broadly upright but oscillating repeatedly between a 5 o'clock & 7 o'clock position (if viewed {{from the bottom of}} the seam). [...] This effectively destroys seam induced swing (as the ball is constantly changing between <b>outswing</b> & inswing seam positions through the air). [...] Thus, the ball travels straight onto the pitch (in theory allowing the bowler to be more accurate). [...] However, when the seam of the ball contacts the pitch at the 5 o'clock position, the result is movement to the left (away to the right-handed batsman), when the seam of the ball contacts the pitch at the 7 o'clock position, the result is movement to the right (in to the right-handed batsman). [...] It can be seen that only rarely would the ball be at the purely 6 o'clock position to continue completely straight after pitching. [...] This aligns with the unpredictable nature of seam bowling, but appears primarily driven by the technique of the bowler, rather than irregularities in the pitch surface.|$|E
50|$|John Alfred 'Jack' Newman (born 12 November 1884 at Southsea, Hampshire; died 21 December 1973 at Groote Schuur, Cape Town, South Africa) was an English cricketer {{who played}} for Hampshire.

50|$|He is a {{right-handed}} batsman and a fast right-arm bowler who {{possesses a}} lot of power with his full-length <b>outswing.</b> In the first innings in which he participated, he achieved figures of 6 for 100, but for Test after Test beyond this, his bowling disappointed in comparison, only picking up during a Test match in Durban, where he achieved figures of 7 for 84.|$|E

50|$|Southee {{is known}} for his ability to {{generate}} late <b>outswing</b> at a brisk pace, and later with off cutting slower balls almost like a faster off-spinner on a damp wicket and death bowling. He was the third-highest wicket-taker at the 2011 ICC World Cup (18 wickets at 17.33). He also impressed at the 2015 ICC World Cup, taking 7 wickets in a round robin league match against England.|$|E
50|$|Mark William Ridgway (born 21 May 1960, Warragul, Victoria) is {{a former}} cricketer, who played for the Tasmanian Tigers from 1993 until 2000. After failing {{to break into the}} Victorian Bushrangers side, he moved to Tasmania, where he became a regular in the Tigers' line-up. A {{reliable}} fast-medium bowler, he was able to generate strong swing, particularly <b>outswing,</b> and made good use of the Derwent River's strong sea breezes to move the ball with good effect.|$|E
5000|$|Ismail was a right-arm fast-medium new ball bowler with a [...] "deceptive action", {{who could}} swing the ball both ways. About Ismail's bowling, former Mumbai captain Milind Rege said, [...] "I found his action very awkward, {{completely}} open-chested, something like Colin Croft.
