5|$|Staszic was {{remembered by}} his contemporaries as a loner {{and not a}} person who was quick to make friends. He has been {{described}} as somewhat miserly; despite acquiring significant wealth, he was said to wear <b>old</b> <b>clothes</b> and use an old carriage. He was nonetheless widely respected by his contemporaries. He was seen as stern but honest, and had a tendency to speak in a fashion that some found amusing.|$|E
5|$|Jerry {{inherits}} {{some old}} possessions {{of his grandfather}} Irving. Among them is a statue that looks just like one George's family had, until George broke it. Jerry promises that George can have it, but leaves it in his apartment for a few days. Kramer takes a few of Irving's <b>old</b> <b>clothes,</b> including a hat which he believes makes him look like Joe Friday of Dragnet. Elaine persuades Jerry to have his apartment cleaned by her client Rava's (Nurit Koppel) boyfriend Ray (Michael D. Conway). Jerry is very impressed {{by the quality of}} the cleaning; but when he and Elaine visit Rava, Jerry notices a statue with a vivid similarity to the one he inherited, and believes Ray stole it. He calls Kramer to check his apartment, and when Kramer cannot find the statue there, Jerry’s suspicion is confirmed.|$|E

5|$|Victorious after {{defeating}} the King in the war, Meliara returns to Tlanth {{to improve its}} dilapidated castle with the family's new riches. One day, Bran visits her, accompanied by his new fiance Lady Nimiar Argaliar and the Marquis of Shevraeth, who is preparing to take the throne of Remalna. Now accustomed to the fine fashions of court, Bran expresses dismay at finding Mel dressed in <b>old</b> <b>clothes</b> - she never before cared about her appearance. Mel becomes shy and embarrassed about her lack of courtly finesse and grace, and avoids the visitors, especially Shevraeth, who she fears looks down on her. Nimiar convinces Mel to return with them to court, and begins to teach her the essential of life there, including its customs, clothing styles, and hand fan language.|$|E
5|$|Jerry, Elaine, George and Kramer {{discuss the}} {{situation}} and Kramer urges Jerry {{to do something about}} it, but Elaine argues that Rava will no longer let her edit her book if Jerry does this. Jerry calls Ray and has lunch with him, while George sits in the next booth and eavesdrops on their conversation. Jerry and George asks him about the statue, but Ray gets offended and leaves when he hears their opinion. Elaine and Rava get into an argument about Jerry's accusation, and Elaine is no longer allowed to edit Rava's book. Without notifying anybody, Kramer dresses up in Irving's <b>old</b> <b>clothes</b> and goes to Ray's apartment, pretending to be a cop, and recovers the statue, despite Ray's protests. Kramer returns the statue to a grateful George. But while George is holding the statue, Kramer gives him a friendly pat on the back, causing George to drop the statue, which breaks when it hits the floor. The episode ends without ever revealing whether or not Ray had in fact stolen the statue from Jerry's apartment.|$|E

Bevin Boys did not wear uniforms or badges, but the <b>oldest</b> <b>clothes</b> they could find. Being of military age and without uniform caused many to be stopped by police and questioned about avoiding call-up.|$|R

There we were to ask for the citizen Rateau, and we were to tell him all our troubles, {{whatever}} they might be. Well! we are in such trouble now, mon petit, that we don't know where to turn. Put on thy very <b>oldest</b> <b>clothes,</b> little one, and run bare-footed into Paris, find the citizen Rateau and tell him just what has happened: the letter which they have forced me to write, the threats which they held over me if I did not write it--everything.

Even after becoming the empress dowager, Wang Yuanji continued to live a humble and frugal life. There were no expensive furniture and decorations in her room; she kept her meals simple, wore <b>old</b> <b>clothes</b> again after washing them, and did her own weaving. She managed the imperial harem well and maintained harmony among Sima Yan's consorts.|$|E
25|$|Georg Steinhauser, {{a chemist}} {{writing in the}} journal Medical Hypotheses, said that small pieces of fluff first form in the hair and then {{end up in the}} navel {{at the end of the}} day. He further said that {{abdominal}} hair often seems to grow in concentric circles around the navel; the scaly structure of the hair enhances the abrasion of minuscule fibres from the shirt and directs the lint towards the belly button. Steinhauser established that shaving one's belly will result in a fluff-free navel but only until the hairs grow back. His other suggestions include wearing <b>old</b> <b>clothes,</b> which tend to shed less lint than newer garments, which can lose up to one-thousandth of their weight to the belly button over the course of a year. A body piercing can also be used, with belly button rings particularly effective at sweeping away fibres before they lodge.|$|E

He had left a clew for Daly, which was all he wanted, but, {{in order to make it}} plainer, he sent the porter to the station with the bag and told him to wait by the Peebles train. Then he set off, dressed in the <b>oldest</b> <b>clothes</b> he had, wondering what adventures he would meet with in the wilds.|$|R
