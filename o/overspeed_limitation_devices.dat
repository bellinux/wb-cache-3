40|$|Abstract—The {{bistable}} ring physical(ly) unclonable function (BR-PUF) {{is a novel}} electrical intrinsic PUF {{design for}} physical cryptography. FPGA prototyping has provided a proof-of-concept, showing that the BR-PUF could be a promising candidate for strong PUFs. However, due to the <b>limitations</b> (<b>device</b> resources, placement and routing) of FPGA prototyping, {{the effectiveness of a}} practical ASIC implementation of the BR-PUF could not be validated. This paper characterizes the BR-PUF further through transistor-level simulations. Based on process variation, mismatch, and noise models provided or suggested by industry, these simulations are able to provide predictions on the figures-of-merit of ASIC implementations of the BR-PUF. This paper also suggests a more secure way of using the BR-PUF based on its supply voltage sensitivity.

We report the results of a review of examination frequency trends, operator training background, and machine operational and safety status in the X-ray facilities in rural mission hospitals in Ghana in 1991 - 92. The radiological workload at the reporting hospitals was low and declined by more than 50 % over the study period. Although most of the X-ray operators had little or no formal training, they produced adequate imaging results. Most of the X-ray machines seen were over 20 years old, yet remained functional, but less than 25 % had standard radiation safety (beam <b>limitation)</b> <b>devices.</b> These results suggest that many rural, first-referral hospitals in developing countries could benefit from a careful review of their services and adoption of the WHO Basic Radiological System (WHO-BRS) ...|$|R

40|$|Crashes {{in which}} lorries or vans are {{involved}} are often serious, {{especially for the}} crash opponent. Lorries are not only involved in crashes because of their drivers' unsafe behaviour (freights falling off, rollovers, jack-knifing), but also because other road users take too little account of them. Many road users do not realize {{that they can be}} positioned in the lorry's blind area or that a lorry can swerve out. Although delivery vans are smaller than lorries, they still are bigger and heavier than cars and their rear view is not as good. That is why the crash causes of delivery vans are often different from those of cars. Infrastructural measures, such as target-group lanes and keeping heavy freight traffic away from urban areas can result in safer lorry and van traffic. In addition, (intelligent) facilities in the vehicle, such as speed <b>limitation</b> <b>devices,</b> can be used.

40|$|In this paper, {{different}} methods to limit short circuit currents in DC traction networks are compared. Typically, DC traction networks are {{supplied by the}} AC grid {{by means of an}} uncontrolled diode bridge rectifier. In case of a low-impedance short circuit fault between catenary and rail, the fault current reaches a large value. For densely meshed networks the mechanical circuit breakers can become too slow. The methods studied are applying fault current limiters, faster interruption of fault currents and adding controlled rectifiers. The fault current limiters considered are a reactor and a superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL). For faster interruption of fault currents, a hybrid circuit breaker is investigated. Simulations show that the short circuit current can be limited considerably by installing <b>limitation</b> <b>devices</b> after the rectifiers, when the short circuit occurs close to a substation. Fast interruption of the fault or application of the SFCL results in the strongest reduction of the short circuit current. status: publishe...|$|R
