5|$|In July 2015, {{after nearly}} {{ten years of}} Eris being {{considered}} the ninth-largest object known to directly <b>orbit</b> <b>the</b> sun, close-up imagery from the New Horizons mission more accurately determined Pluto's volume to be slightly larger than Eris's, rather than slightly smaller as previously thought. Eris is now the tenth-largest object known to directly <b>orbit</b> <b>the</b> sun by volume, though not by mass.|$|E
5|$|The Gemini {{spacecraft}} {{would have}} rendezvoused with stacked Centaur and Agena upper stages in low Earth <b>orbit.</b> <b>The</b> Centaur would have placed the Gemini and Agena onto a circumlunar trajectory, along {{which they would}} coast {{until they reached the}} Moon. The Agena would then have been used to perform Lunar orbit insertion. Following the completion of activities in Lunar <b>orbit,</b> <b>the</b> Agena would have been fired again for trans-Earth injection.|$|E
5|$|The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system {{comprising}} the Sun and the objects that orbit it, {{either directly or}} indirectly. Of those objects that <b>orbit</b> <b>the</b> Sun directly, the largest eight are the planets, with the remainder being significantly smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that <b>orbit</b> <b>the</b> Sun indirectly, the moons, two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury.|$|E

5|$|The crests of Corythosaurus {{resemble}} {{that of a}} cassowary, or a Corinthian helmet. They {{are formed}} {{by a combination of}} the praemaxillae, nasals, prefrontals and frontals, as in Saurolophus, but instead of projecting backwards as a spine, they rise up to make the highest point above the <b>orbit.</b> <b>The</b> two halves of the crest are separated by a median suture.

5|$|Another {{proposed}} mission {{would have}} seen a Gemini spacecraft rendezvous with a Pegasus satellite in low Earth <b>orbit.</b> <b>The</b> spacecraft would have either been launched directly into an orbit to rendezvous with the Pegasus, or into a lower orbit, subsequently docking with an Agena, and using that to raise its <b>orbit.</b> <b>The</b> Gemini would have flown around the Pegasus, {{and then one of}} the crew would have performed an EVA to recover a piece of one of the spacecraft's micrometeoroid detection panels. This mission would have been used to prove that rendezvous could be accomplished with any spacecraft, to collect data on the satellite's exposure to micrometeoroids — supporting data that the satellite had returned itself, and to demonstrate technology for military flights to inspect hostile satellites.|$|E
5|$|CryoSat-2 was {{launched}} at 13:57:04 UTC on 8 April 2010.

5|$|HD 154672 b has an orbital {{eccentricity}} of 0.61, denoting a very elliptical <b>orbit.</b> <b>The</b> planet's discoverers noted that if water {{existed in the}} planet's atmosphere, it might change from a liquid state to a gaseous state as the planet swings closer to its host star, increasing its temperature.|$|E

5000|$|... 1081 Reseda is a {{minor planet}} <b>orbiting</b> <b>the</b> Sun. Initially it {{received}} the designation 1927 QF. The numerical designation indicates this was the 1081st asteroid discovered. It <b>orbits</b> <b>the</b> sun every 5.5 years.|$|R
5|$|John Herschel Glenn Jr. (July 18, 1921– December 8, 2016) was a United States Marine Corps aviator, engineer, astronaut, and United States Senator from Ohio. In 1962, {{he became}} the first American to <b>orbit</b> <b>the</b> Earth, {{circling}} it three times.|$|E
5|$|Mike Brown {{counters}} {{these claims}} by saying that, far from not having cleared their orbits, the major planets completely control {{the orbits of}} the other bodies within their orbital zone. Jupiter may coexist {{with a large number}} of small bodies in its <b>orbit</b> (<b>the</b> Trojan asteroids), but these bodies only exist in Jupiter's orbit because they are in the sway of the planet's huge gravity. Similarly, Pluto may cross the orbit of Neptune, but Neptune long ago locked Pluto and its attendant Kuiper belt objects, called plutinos, into a 3:2 resonance, i.e., they <b>orbit</b> <b>the</b> Sun twice for every three Neptune orbits. The orbits of these objects are entirely dictated by Neptune's gravity, and thus, Neptune is gravitationally dominant.|$|E
5|$|The orbital {{properties}} of Triton were already determined with high accuracy in the 19th century. It {{was found to}} have a retrograde orbit, at a very high angle of inclination to the plane of Neptune's <b>orbit.</b> <b>The</b> first detailed observations of Triton were not made until 1930. Little was known about the satellite until Voyager 2 flew by in 1989.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: <b>The</b> <b>orbit</b> of Triton (red) is {{different}} from most moons' <b>orbit</b> (green) in <b>the</b> <b>orbit's</b> direction, and <b>the</b> <b>orbit</b> is tilted −23°.|$|R
50|$|HD 101930 b is an {{extrasolar planet}} <b>orbiting</b> <b>the</b> star HD 101930. It has a minimum mass {{a third of}} Jupiter's, nearly the same as Saturn's so it {{is thought to be}} a gas giant. It <b>orbits</b> <b>the</b> star closer than Mercury, and <b>the</b> <b>orbit</b> is {{slightly}} eccentric.|$|R
50|$|HD 114783 b is an {{exoplanet}} {{that has}} a minimum mass almost exactly that of Jupiter. However, since the true mass is not known, {{it may be more}} massive, but not likely much. It <b>orbits</b> <b>the</b> star 20% further than Earth <b>orbits</b> <b>the</b> Sun. <b>The</b> <b>orbit</b> is quite circular.|$|R
5|$|The vulcanoids are a {{hypothetical}} population of asteroids that <b>orbit</b> <b>the</b> Sun in a dynamically stable zone inside {{the orbit of}} the planet Mercury. They are named after the hypothetical planet Vulcan, whose existence was disproven in 1915. So far, no vulcanoids have been discovered, {{and it is not}} yet clear if any exist.|$|E
5|$|Alan Stern and Harold F. Levison {{introduced}} a parameter Λ (lambda), expressing {{the likelihood of}} an encounter resulting in a given deflection of <b>orbit.</b> <b>The</b> value of this parameter in Stern's model {{is proportional to the}} square of the mass and inversely proportional to the period. This value can be used to estimate the capacity of a body to clear the neighbourhood of its orbit, where Λ > 1 will eventually clear it. A gap of five orders of magnitude in Λ was found between the smallest terrestrial planets and the largest asteroids and Kuiper belt objects.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a tidal shock, streams of stars can be pulled away from the cluster halo, leaving only the core part of the cluster. These tidal {{interaction}} effects create tails of stars that can extend up to several degrees of arc away from the cluster. These tails typically both precede and follow the cluster along its <b>orbit.</b> <b>The</b> tails can accumulate significant portions of the original mass of the cluster, and can form clumplike features.|$|E
50|$|The two {{planets are}} in a 2:1 resonance, meaning that <b>the</b> outer planet <b>orbits</b> <b>the</b> star once every time when <b>the</b> inner planet <b>orbits</b> <b>the</b> star twice. These two jovian planets are dancing around each other gravitationally.|$|R
5000|$|HD 6434 b is an {{extrasolar planet}} <b>orbiting</b> <b>the</b> star HD 6434. It has a minimum mass {{about half that}} of Jupiter. It <b>orbits</b> <b>the</b> star very close, over 2.5 times as close as Mercury <b>orbits</b> <b>the</b> Sun. For this reason it completes one orbit in only 22 days. Unlike true [...] "hot Jupiters" [...] like 51 Pegasi b, HD 6434 b {{does not have a}} {{circular}} orbit, but rather an eccentric one.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>orbit</b> of {{a planet}} around the Sun is an ellipse, with the Sun {{in one of the}} focal points of that ellipse. [...] <b>The</b> planet's <b>orbit</b> lies in a plane, called the orbital plane. The point on <b>the</b> <b>orbit</b> closest to <b>the</b> {{attracting}} body is the periapsis. The point farthest from the attracting body is called the apoapsis. There are also specific terms for orbits about particular bodies; things <b>orbiting</b> <b>the</b> Sun have a perihelion and aphelion, things <b>orbiting</b> <b>the</b> Earth have a perigee and apogee, and things <b>orbiting</b> <b>the</b> Moon have a perilune and apolune (or periselene and aposelene respectively). An orbit around any star, not just the Sun, has a periastron and an apastron.|$|R
5|$|As the Sun expands, it will {{swallow the}} planets Mercury and Venus. Earth's fate is less clear; {{although}} the Sun will envelop Earth's current <b>orbit,</b> <b>the</b> star's loss of mass (and thus weaker gravity) {{will cause the}} planets' orbits to move farther out. If it were only for this, Venus and Earth would probably escape incineration, but a 2008 study suggests that Earth will likely be swallowed up {{as a result of}} tidal interactions with the Sun's weakly bound outer envelope.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the {{original}} spacecraft was completed in August 2004. Following testing, the spacecraft was shipped to the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in Russia during August 2005 and arrived on 1 September. The launch occurred from Site 133/3 on 8 October, however due to a missing command in the rocket's flight control system, the second stage engine did not shut {{down at the end}} of its planned burn, and instead the stage burned to depletion. This prevented the second stage and Briz-KM from separating, and as a result the rocket failed to achieve <b>orbit.</b> <b>The</b> spacecraft was lost when it reentered over the Arctic Ocean, north of Greenland.|$|E
5|$|Eris {{was never}} officially {{classified}} as a planet, and the 2006 definition of planet defined both Eris and Pluto not as planets but as dwarf planets {{because they have not}} cleared their neighbourhoods. They do not <b>orbit</b> <b>the</b> Sun alone, but as part of a population of similarly sized objects. Pluto itself is now recognized as {{being a member of the}} Kuiper belt and the largest dwarf planet, larger than the more-massive Eris.|$|E
