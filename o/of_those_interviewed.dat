However, all but three <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>interviewed</b> agreed that the anthem {{should continue to be}} sung in Malay. The three persons who disagreed felt that the anthem should be in English because that was the language most commonly used in Singapore.

5|$|Based on Kinsey's scale where 0 {{represents}} {{a person with}} an exclusively heterosexual response and 6 {{represents a}} person with an exclusively homosexual one, and numbers in between represent a gradient of responses with both sexes, 6% <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>interviewed</b> ranked as a 6: exclusively homosexual. Apart from those who ranked 0 (71%), the largest percentage in between 0 and 6 was 1 at approximately 15%. However, the Kinsey Report remarked that the ranking described a period in a person's life, and that a person's orientation may change. Among the criticisms the Kinsey Report received, a particular one addressed the Institute for Sex Research's tendency to use statistical sampling, which facilitated an over-representation of same-sex relationships by other researchers who did not adhere to Kinsey's qualifications of data.|$|E

25|$|Although not as {{overwhelmingly}} supportive as it {{was from}} the 1930s through the early 1960s, a clear majority of the American public approves of labor unions. The Gallup organization has tracked public opinion of unions since 1936, when it found that 72 percent approved of unions.

25|$|The {{campaign}} received varied response. A {{survey conducted}} by The Sunday Times found {{that a majority of}} the citizens were not convinced that frozen pork was as delectable as fresh pork, and opined that the difference in price was negligible. A small percentage <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>interviewed</b> were indifferent. According to the Singapore Pork Merchants' Association, about seventy percent of the pork-consuming population preferred fresh to frozen pork at the time of the campaign. The Frozen Pork Hotline was deemed a failed project, with virtually nobody calling it. On the other hand, foreign pork merchants from countries including Australia, New Zealand and the United States were very supportive of the campaign as it would help boost their pork sales.|$|E
500|$|Sexual Preference {{attracted}} considerable {{media attention}} in 1981. Prior to its publication, Jane E. Brody wrote in The New York Times {{that the study}} was [...] "likely to arouse controversy {{not only because of}} its findings, which the authors expect to anger both the psychoanalytic and the homosexual communities, but also because it relies on the memories <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>interviewed</b> and on a statistical technique called path analysis that is subject to misuse and can only explore existing notions, not create new ones." [...] According to Brody, Bell said that he expected the study to be condemned by both [...] "radical gays for even looking into the subject and by the analysts who may say we're trying to paint a glowing picture of homosexuality," [...] the psychologist John DeCecco called Sexual Preference [...] "very dubious on a theoretical basis and on the basis of how reliable and valid is asking people about their childhood", and the psychoanalyst Irving Bieber described Bell et al.′s findings as [...] "totally disparate" [...] with his experience from psychiatric consultation.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Time {{magazine}} {{said that}} Jamaica {{may be the}} most homophobic country in the world. The country's laws criminalising same-sex activity between males were introduced in 1864, during the British colonial administration. According to the Sexual Offences Act of 2009, any man convicted under these laws must register as a sex offender. These laws have been cited as contributing to wider homophobic attitudes among the Jamaican populace, including the view that gay people are criminals {{regardless of whether or not}} they have committed any criminal act. Anti-LGBT perspectives have been furthered by the island's conservative Christian churches. Many reggae and dancehall songs, among them Buju Banton's [...] "Boom Bye Bye", call for the killing of gays. Writing for the International Business Times in the summer of 2013, the journalist Palash Gosh noted that while Jamaica was [...] "awash in crime and violence, gays and lesbians are particularly prominent targets of wanton brutality." [...] In the mid-2000s, two of Jamaica's best-known LGBT rights activists, Brian Williamson and Steve Harvey, were murdered. In the summer of 2013, Human Rights Watch carried out five weeks of fieldwork among Jamaica's LGBT community, reporting that over half <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>interviewed</b> had experienced violence as a result of their sexual orientation or gender identity, sometimes on more than one occasion.|$|E

500|$|By 31 March, 14th Field Troop had {{completed}} its mine-awareness training; only Lieutenant Stephen Alexander and five others remained at Oshakati, the main SADF {{base in the}} north of the country. During the early hours of 1 April an SADF aircraft began dropping flares, and mortar rounds landed near the base. This signalled the start of an intense period of conflict, and Alexander's team was quickly withdrawn to Grootfontein. What had occurred was the infiltration {{of a large number of}} PLAN combatants (about 1,600), re-entering Namibia from Angola. Accounts differed, but Hearn stated that all <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>interviewed</b> at the time made it clear that [...] "they did not enter Namibia for war, but to seek out the UN". Reuters reported that SWAPO demanded the right to establish bases in Namibia. The large size of the PLAN forces and the very small number of deployed UN forces (less than 1,000 at the time) meant that the UN had very little intelligence, and was unable to respond in force. Sitkowski wrote that the UN should have been informed about the high probability of SWAPO infiltration, but this did not occur. The Australians were the first to know about the incursion, but they only found out informally via church sources at the Pastoral Centre (the accommodations for headquarters staff).|$|E
2500|$|The {{experience}} of sensing {{the presence of}} a deceased loved one is a commonly reported phenomenon in bereavement. It can {{take the form of a}} clearly sensory impression or can involve a quasi-sensory 'feeling' of presence. Rees conducted a study of 293 widowed people living in a particular area of mid-Wales. [...] He found that 14% <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>interviewed</b> reported having had a visual hallucination of their deceased spouse, 13.3% an auditory one and 2.7% a tactile one. These categories overlapped to some extent as some people reported a hallucinatory experience in more than one modality. Of interest in light of the previous heading was the fact that 46.7% of the sample reported experiencing the presence of the deceased spouse. Other studies have similarly reported a frequency of approximately 50% in the bereaved population.|$|E

2500|$|Predominantly male phenotypes vary in {{the degree}} of genital undermasculinization to include micropenis, chordee, [...] scrotum, and / or pseudovaginal perineoscrotal hypospadias. [...] Impotence may be fairly common, {{depending}} on phenotypic features; in one study of 15 males with PAIS, 80% <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>interviewed</b> indicated that they had some degree of impotence. [...] Anejaculation appears to occur somewhat independently of impotence; some men are still able to ejaculate despite impotence, and others without erectile difficulties cannot. [...] Predominantly female phenotypes include a variable degree of labial fusion and clitoromegaly. [...] Ambiguous phenotypic states include a phallic structure that is intermediate between a clitoris and a penis, and a single perineal orifice that connects to both the urethra and the vagina (i.e. urogenital sinus). [...] At birth, it may not be possible to immediately differentiate the external genitalia of individuals with PAIS as being either male or female, although the majority of individuals with PAIS are raised male.|$|E
40|$|Policing organisations {{across the}} {{developed}} world increasingly need language interpreters to communicate with non-native speaking people. Little research has investigated police perceptions of using interpreter services, despite their growing need, documented concerns and lack of a widely accepted best practice. A survey of 413 police officers documented interpreted interviews in Australia and assessed police perceptions <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>interviews.</b> Interviews carried out by police included a higher number of suspect interviews and interviews via telephone interpreters. Cases more often involved sexual assault, assault and domestic violence. Indigenous people, victims and witnesses were identified as potentially vulnerable to not being provided interpreters.

2500|$|Beginning in 1998, {{one month}} after the tenth anniversary, Professor David Alexander, {{director}} of the Aberdeen Centre for Trauma Research at Robert Gordon University carried out a study into the long-term psychological and social effects of Piper Alpha. He managed to find thirty-six survivors who agreed to give interviews or complete questionnaires. Almost all of this group reported psychological problems. More than 70% <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>interviewed</b> reported psychological and behavioural symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder. Twenty-eight said they had difficulty in finding employment following the disaster; it appears that some offshore employers regarded Piper Alpha survivors as Jonahs – bringers of bad luck, who would not be welcome on other rigs and platforms. The family members of the dead and surviving victims also reported various psychological and social problems. Alexander also wrote that [...] "some of these lads are stronger than before Piper. They've learned things about themselves, changed their values, some relationships became stronger. People realised they have strengths they didn't know they had. There was a lot of heroism took place." ...|$|E

None <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>interviewed</b> claimed a family background in the ethnic nationalist movement. Instead, he noted that members claimed that they joined the party {{as a result of}} a [...] "profound sense of anxiety over immigration and rising ethno-cultural diversity" [...] in Britain, along with its concomitant impact on [...] "British culture and society". He noted that among these members, the perceived cultural threat of immigrants and ethnic minorities was given greater prominence than the perceived economic threat that they posed to white Britons. He noted that in his interviews with them, members often framed Islam in particular as a threat to British values and society, expressing the fear that British Muslims wanted to Islamicise the country and eventually impose sharia law on its population.|$|E

One <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>interviewed,</b> Junior Seau, bluntly said that such practices crossed the line into threatening a person's livelihood. (Seau would commit suicide less than two months after the interview was published; it was discovered after his death that he suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) {{as a result of the}} numerous head injuries Seau suffered during his 20-year NFL career.) Seau's sentiments were echoed by Hall of Fame quarterback Fran Tarkenton. In an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal, Tarkenton wrote that he played against the likes of Mean Joe Greene, Ray Nitschke and Dick Butkus, and none of them even considered deliberately trying to hurt him. He also said that he discussed the issue with several players from his era, and they unanimously agreed that players who put bounties on opponents were [...] "cowards." ...|$|E
