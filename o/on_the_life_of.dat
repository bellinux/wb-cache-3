5|$|Cucumber focuses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> {{the middle-aged}} Henry Best (Vincent Franklin) and {{the fallout from}} a {{disastrous}} date with his boyfriend of nine years, and is accompanied with Banana, an E4 anthology series featuring younger characters across the LGBT spectrum {{on the periphery of}} the Cucumber narrative, and Tofu, an online documentary series available on 4oD discussing modern sex, sexuality and issues arisen during the show with the cast and public.
