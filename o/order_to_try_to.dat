5|$|On 1 February 1917, Kaiser Wilhelm II {{personally}} {{approved a}} resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> force the British to make peace. The new {{rules of engagement}} specified that no ship was to be left afloat, although British reports for several of UB-43s victims suggest that von Mellenthin was already operating in this manner.|$|E
5|$|The {{residents}} of Milwaukee Avenue {{and the surrounding}} Seward neighborhood formed the Seward West Project Area Committee (PAC) in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> save the Milwaukee Avenue homes. They argued that the houses had significant historic value {{and needed to be}} preserved. The City argued that the houses were legally nonconforming, and rehabilitating them would cost more than just building new houses.|$|E
5|$|I {{then got}} some Coal {{from one of}} the Pits nearest thereunto, which I {{distilled}} in a Retort in an open Fire. At first there came over only Phlegm, afterwards a black Oil, and then likewise a Spirit arose, which I could noways condense, but it forced my Lute, or broke my Glasses. Once, when it had forced the Lute, coming close thereto, in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> repair it, I observed that the Spirit which issued out caught Fire at the Flame of the Candle, and continued burning with Violence as it issued out, in a Stream, which 1 blew out, and lighted again, alternately, for several times.|$|E

50|$|St. Croix {{became known}} as Bone Island in the 18th century after many of the graves were exposed by erosion. Twenty-three sets of remains were removed in 1969 and {{subsequently}} reburied in 2003. Analysis showed {{that many of them}} had indications of scurvy, confirming the cause of the deaths described by Champlain. One skull showed signs of having been autopsied, which Champlain wrote that he had <b>ordered</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> discover the cause of their illness.|$|R
50|$|After the clash, {{elements}} of the 3rd Legions Division were <b>ordered</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> break through German positions and reach Solec nad Wisla. Polish soldiers, in groups of app. 300, concentrated in local forests, but the division as such ceased to exist. Those who managed to cross the Vistula joined 1st Legions Infantry Division, and fought in the Battle of Tomaszow Lubelski. Other soldiers joined the unit of Colonel Stanislaw Gumowski, {{which was part of}} Polish Northern Front (1939), and fought near Krasnystaw.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, a shuttlepod {{containing}} Sub-Commander T'Pol, Lieutenant Reed, Ensign Mayweather and MACO Corporal Hawkins, departs {{to investigate}} a nearby sphere in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> collect more data on the Sphere Builders (who are now becoming increasingly concerned with the human threat). The away team successfully enters an exhaust vent, and reaching the core, {{they are able to}} retrieve a memory module. The intrusion alerts an automated defense system, however, and Hawkins is disintegrated helping the others escape.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese general, {{convinced}} of the impossibility of taking Badajoz by assault, changed his strategy and began a circumvallation of the town, in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> isolate it completely. The Spanish, meanwhile, were reinforcing their own defensive fortifications with extensive works, mainly ravelins built between the medieval towers. Various outlying forts were also strengthened {{with the aim of}} obstructing the Portuguese works and forcing them to build a larger circumvallation line. One of these forts was San Miguel, a star fort able to accommodate 600 infantry, built around a hermitage. It had five earthen bulwarks and an artillery-proof parapet.|$|E
5|$|With the Winter Olympics {{being held}} in Canada, the writers wanted an Olympic-themed episode that could air during the Games. The script was written by Rob LaZebnik, who {{considered}} having the plot revolve around Homer competing in four-man bobsled. However, he decided a curling episode would allow for the plot to revolve around Homer and Marge. In <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> make the depiction of curling in the episode accurate, the writers visited a curling club and tried the sport themselves. They also consulted {{with a number of}} curlers. The episode was directed by Chuck Sheetz, while sportscaster Bob Costas guest-starred in the episode.|$|E

We can arm {{ourselves}} and lock up all the other weapons, and tell the men they shall have big money if they ask no questions and stick to their duty," [...] added Jasper Van Blott.|$|R
50|$|In many {{institutes of}} higher learning, {{as well as}} in some high schools, protests began during courses on {{politics}} and Russian language. Faced with hostile students, a number of professors had to leave their classrooms. The faculty received <b>orders</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> calm down the students. For the party leadership, the disturbances that took place during Russian classes were an especially serious matter, as all this occurred in October, a month that had been dedicated to the Romanian-Soviet friendship in honour of the October Revolution.|$|R
60|$|Arthur as {{briefly as}} he could, {{for he was}} very anxious to return to poor Tam, {{explained}} the wreck and the subsequent adventures, saying that he feared the poor Countess was lost, {{but that he had}} seen her daughter and some of her suite on a rock. Captain Beresford was horrified at the idea of a Christian child among the wild Arabs. His station was Minorca, but he had just been at the Bay of Rosas, where poor Comte de Bourke's anxiety and distress about his wife and children were known, and he had received a request amounting <b>to</b> <b>orders</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> obtain intelligence about them, so that he held it to be within his duty to make at once for Djigheli Bay.|$|R
5|$|Because vaquitas are {{indigenous}} to the Gulf of California, Mexico is leading conservation efforts {{with the creation}} of the International Committee for the Recovery of the Vaquita (CIRVA), which has tried to prevent the accidental deaths of vaquitas by outlawing the use of fishing nets within the vaquita's habitat. CIRVA has worked together with the CITES, the Endangered Species Act, and the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) to nurse the vaquita population back to a point at which they can sustain themselves. CIRVA concluded in 2000 that between 39 and 84 individuals are killed each year by such gillnets. In <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> prevent extinction, the Mexican government has created a nature reserve covering {{the upper part of the}} Gulf of California and the Colorado River delta. They have also placed a temporary ban on fishing, with compensation to those affected, that may pose a threat to the vaquita.|$|E
5|$|The Latvian {{government}} took {{a number of}} steps in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> bring the situation under control, and in 2006 {{not only were the}} events planned by right wing organizations not approved, but the monument was fenced off, according to an announcement by Riga city council, for restoration. The monument was indeed restored in 2006, but this statement was later questioned, as politicians named various other reasons for the change of date, the enclosed area was much larger than needed for restoration, and the weather appeared inappropriate for restoration work. Therefore, the government was criticized by the Latvian press for being unable to ensure public safety and freedom of speech. The unapproved events took place despite the ban. On November 23, 2006, the law requiring the approval of the authorities for public gatherings was ruled unconstitutional. In the future years the government mobilized the police force to guard the neighborhood of the monument and the events were relatively peaceful.|$|E
5|$|The club {{began their}} league {{campaign}} with two draws, but defeat by Cardiff City {{marked the beginning}} of a seven-game losing streak. Results improved in October and November before three more successive defeats saw Sturrock replaced by Mariner. Performances gradually improved and the club won both of their fixtures during the Christmas period, including a 4â€“1 win against Reading; their best of the season. The club signed Damien Johnson in the winter transfer window from Birmingham City and made a number of signings on loan, including Kenny Cooper and David Stockdale, in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> improve their league position. A succession of draws and narrow defeats followed in February, which prompted Mariner to make more signings.|$|E
50|$|During March, {{the weight}} of the ground {{operations}} was moved to the Bay of Vyborg, where the Red Army <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> cross the ice to southern Finland. The whole Finnish Air Force was <b>ordered</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> stop the Soviet offensive. No. 24 Sqn flew 154 missions against the Soviet troop movements on the ice. A cease-fire was signed on March 13. No 24 sqn had started the war with 36 fighters and were left with 22. The unit claimed 120 aircraft downed (of which 100 were bombers). Own losses amounted to 11 aircraft, of who 9 had been lost to the enemy.|$|R
5|$|The German {{invasion}} of France through the Netherlands and Belgium began on 10 May 1940. Army Group A fought {{its way through}} southern Belgium and north-eastern France. German forces pushed the French Army and the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) to the Meuse river on 12 May, crossing it that evening. From there, the German forces rapidly advanced to the English Channel {{over the course of}} the next week. BEF units, including detached companies of the Royal Norfolks and Royal Scots, were <b>ordered</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> slow the German advance in northern France to buy time to evacuate troops at Dunkirk.|$|R
50|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war, he was called down to London to represent the Daily Mail at the Press Bureau in London. In October 1914 he was <b>ordered</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> get to Ostend before it {{was taken by the}} German Army. When he discovered that he was too late, he traveled to Europe anyway and managed to get to Dunkirk, where he stayed three months. He lived there as a fugitive because of a ban on war reporters at the front during {{the early part of the}} war and was the first reporter to get into Ypres following the German destruction of it in November 1914.|$|R
5|$|On 20 June, {{after an}} {{ineffective}} bombardment by a 6-gun battery {{put in place}} to try to breach the parapets, the Portuguese tercios and the cavalry, the latter covered by ranks of musketeers, were ordered to attack. The advance was made difficult by the presence of vineyard fences in the field. Moreover, 5 Portuguese battalions {{at the head of the}} attack were surprised by the Spanish cavalry of the Duke of Osuna and his general, don Juan de Pacheco, followed by the Duke of San German who, with various Spanish tercios, had sallied out of Badajoz in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> counter the Portuguese assault. Maestre de Campo of Tercio de la Armada, whose brother the Irish officer William Dongan was the commander of the Fort of San Miguel, managed to reach the fort. Albuquerque, meanwhile ordered dom Luiz de Menezes to reinforce his vanguard battalions. The Portuguese cavalry was also sent into action. Teniente General Diniz de Mello de Castro was wounded and captured, but a Spanish counter-attack was repelled and the Fort of San Miguel finally surrendered.|$|E
5|$|The Odyssey was {{released}} by Magnavox in September 1972. After initially ordering a production run of 50,000 units, prior to release Magnavox increased its production capabilities and built up a large stock of the systems, as market testing had shown an enthusiastic response to the console. The Odyssey was sold only through Magnavox dealers and not through general retailers; Magnavox felt that as the first video game console it would draw consumers into its stores. The device retailed for US$99.99, or US$50 when purchased along with a Magnavox television. There are conflicting reports between Baer and Magnavox employees as to whether Magnavox produced 120,000 or 140,000 consoles in 1972; additionally, Odyssey product manager Bob Fritsche recalls selling 69,000 units that year, while Baer recalls sales being closer to 100,000. Baer has stated that he felt the low initial sales were due to the high priceâ€”US$100 being the equivalent of US$587 in 2017â€”and because of Magnavox restricting sales to their dealerships and implying that the device only worked with Magnavox televisions. Other sources have stated that dealership salespeople would try to mislead customers to that effect in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> sell more television sets. Magnavox assistant product planner Don Emry has noted that the sales were {{in line with the}} original projections, if not with the production run.|$|E
5|$|They {{arrive at}} the planet and travel to an {{underground}} vault which had been ransacked. As {{they are about to}} leave, Worf discovers a secret chamber containing the sword. They are attacked by Toral (Rick Pasqualone), son of Duras who had hired the Lethean and wants the sword for the prestige of finding it. Kor, Worf and Jadzia fight past Toral and his men and after finding that they cannot transport back to the Runabout in orbit, they head into the adjoining cave system in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> get out of range of whatever Toral is using to block the transporter. As they travel through the caves, the Klingons begin to be affected by the prestige of the sword. Kor begins to talk about how it would allow him to overthrow Chancellor Gowron and Emperor Kahless II but Worf says that he should be the one to lead their people. Suddenly, Kor slips down the side of a cliff but refuses {{to let go of the}} sword. Worf grabs the other end of the sword, and tries to convince Kor to let go as he cannot pull him and the sword up.|$|E
50|$|By {{the evening}} of September 9, the {{regiment}} reached Zyznow, and {{on the next day}} in the morning, it crossed the San river. It was then <b>ordered</b> <b>to</b> provide rear guard for the units of the 24th Infantry Division, marching towards Bircza. On September 12, the regiment reached the village of Borownica. Since it had already been captured by the enemy, Colonel Beniamin Kotarba decided to assault the Germans. After a bloody clash during which the Poles were unable to push back the enemy, the regiment was dispersed and its soldiers were <b>ordered</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> reach Polish positions near Lwow. Colonel Kotarba himself was killed in action.|$|R

50|$|This contrasted {{sharply with}} the British, who put great {{emphasis}} on the war for control of North America. In 1758 the British launched several major offensives, capturing Louisbourg, Fort Duquesne, and Fort Frontenac, although they were stopped at Fort Carillon. The following year a large force under General Jeffery Amherst took Carillon and Fort Niagara, while a second large force under General Wolfe sailed up the St Lawrence River to besiege Quebec City. The French commander in Quebec, Louis-Joseph de Montcalm, had <b>orders</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> hold out until the winter spell, with the promise that major reinforcements would arrive from Europe the following year. Montcalm almost achieved this, delaying British attempts to capture Quebec until the autumn, when the British finally won the Battle of Quebec and captured the city. In spite of this, a large force of French escaped westwards, intent on resuming the campaign the following year.|$|R
25|$|On 18 October, a {{declaration}} was read over the army-controlled radio stations, banning the PKI. The ban included the party itself, and its youth and women's wings, peasant associations, intellectual and student groups, and the SOBSI union. At the time, {{it was not}} clear whether this ban applied only to Jakarta (by then controlled by the Army), or the whole Republic of Indonesia. However, the ban was soon used as a pretext for the Indonesian Army to go throughout the country carrying out extrajudicial punishments, including mass arrest and summary executions, against suspected leftists and Sukarno loyalists. As the violence spread, Sukarno issued <b>orders</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> stop it, but he was ignored. He also refused to blame the PKI for the coup, let alone ban it as the Army demanded. However, although Suharto and Nasution were increasingly suspicious about Sukarno's role in the affair, the Army was reluctant to confront the president directly because of his still widespread popularity.|$|R
